    "description": "The Hopper app has helped over 100 million travelers find and secure the best price on flights, hotels, homes and car rentals - each and every time they book their trips.\n\nBook Flights, Hotels, Homes & Rental Cars \nFind millions of flights, hotels, homes, rental cars (and cute bunnies) – all in one app. Book your trip safely and securely, in just a couple taps and a swipe. \n\nAlways Get the Best Price \nYou can watch a trip right in the app and we’ll send you a notification when it’s the best time to buy — recommending you to book now, or maybe wait just a little longer.\n\nEasily Find The Cheapest Travel Dates \nSimply search your preferred destination and use Hopper’s color-coded deals calendar to easily find the cheapest travel dates for your trip.\n\nNot Ready to Book Right Away?\nHopper lets you freeze the price, so that you never miss a travel deal. For a small fee, take the time you need to finalize your plans, or wait for your next paycheck to come in. If the price goes up, you only pay the price you froze it at. But if the price goes down, you just pay the lower price. \n\nTravel with Confidence\nAvoid fees and frustration! Make any trip flexible with Hopper’s Cancel and Change for Any Reason plans. Get instantly rebooked without extra costs if your flight is delayed or you miss a connection with Hopper’s Flight Disruption Guarantee. Travel stress free with 24/7 access to Hopper’s Customer Support. \n\nHelp the Planet, One Booking at a Time. \nWith every booking that occurs on Hopper, we pledge to plant 2 trees to offset the carbon footprint. To date, we’ve planted over 31 million trees. \n\nHopper has no ads, no spam, and no stress — just accurate predictions and travel deals.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

    "description": "Wanderlog is a free travel app (with an optional subscription) for planning every kind of trip, including road trips and group travel: create a trip itinerary, budget costs, organize flight and hotel reservations, view places to visit on a map, and collaborate with friends. With an optional subscription, you can also export your trip to Google Maps and link your Gmail account. After your trip, share a travel guide to inspire other travelers.\n\n- See flights, hotels, and attractions in one place (like TripIt and Tripcase)\n- View plans on a travel map & map your route (like Roadtrippers)\n- Rearrange the order of places easily by drag-and-drop\n- Planning a road trip? Add unlimited stops for free, optimize your route, view times & distances between places, and export places to Google Maps\n- Planning group travel? Invite friends and collaborate in real-time just (like Google Docs)\n- Automatically import reservations by forwarding emails or connecting your Gmail\n- Add things to do from top guides with 1 click (like Tripadvisor and Google Trips/Google Travel)\n- Access your trip plans offline\n- Add notes and links to your stops\n- Have your trip plans automatically sync across devices\n- Set budget, track expenses, and split bills with a group\n\n-------\n\nSEE IT ON A MAP\n\nEvery time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.\n\nSTORE PLANS OFFLINE\n\nAll your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.\n\nGET ON THE ROAD\n\nLooking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.\n\nCOLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS\n\nFor group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.\n\nSTAY ORGANIZED\n\nAccess flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.\n\nGET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION\n\nFor each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.\n\nCONTROL YOUR SPENDING\n\nSet a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates.",
