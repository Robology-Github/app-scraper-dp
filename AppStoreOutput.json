I found comfort in seeing so many people on here being them genuine selves, just boldly promoting their business, jokes, skills, family, etc‚Ä¶ I have always felt like I would be a content creator for God( Kingdom Speaker) but I felt so ashamed of what I may look or sound like to other people. This app has truly changed my life and I will always remember where I found the confidence and power to speak on what I believe in. At first I saw it as something that shorten our attention spans or a distraction, but once I became a creator myself and found the right ‚Äúside of TikTok‚Äù I truly found an amazing place for what I love to do. Fellowship(Spreading the word/ love of Jesus) and motivating others is what I feel called to do, and my followers as well as individuals I follow here on the app have facilitated that calling. So much that I am doing the same on other platforms more confidently than I ever imagined. TikTok is a life changing app and I don‚Äôt even make money here! people truly find themselves, seeing so many other people doing what they love! | Muy bueno muy entretenido | TikTok is a vital app that the American people need right now in order to keep up with what‚Äôs going on with our politicians and our government | If you don‚Äôt have a tiktok but your work is mildly popular somewhere else, etc. you have no grounds to stand on if someone takes your work and reuploads it to tiktok and makes money off of it. Some of my dearest friends are artists that have had their work stolen and reposted onto tiktok without their permission, and these reposters get hundreds of thousands of views from stolen content. I understand that the platform is huge and it‚Äôs unrealistic to staff enough people to physically check anytime someone tries to copyright claim, but something‚Äôs gotta change. | I enjoy TikTok | PLEASE BRING BACK THE FEATURE TO PIN COMMENTSüò≠ its so helpful to just pin the most asked questions / important info :( also not being able to tag people anymore , please bring it back!! | ü•∞ | Esta aplicaci√≥n es un libro .Te puede cambiar la vida en un mes .Y mucho mejor que el Facebook aburrido ese üòÇ. | It is so fun there is so many things to learn on it and it is FREE you can make your own videos and watch others tick tick is the best app I‚Äôve got. | I love TikTok. It is the best me like many others, hope, and pray it stays forever. | Love it here ! I laugh all day over here | I‚Äôm going to be livid if this app is banned to protect the interests of equally, if not more corrupt platforms. US representatives selectively ‚Äúprotect‚Äù US citizens from platforms they don‚Äôt make money from and throw us to the wolves for platforms they profit from. We aren‚Äôt completely ignorant, but many of us are completely fed up! We are left with the options of capitalistic privatization of everything and without the mean to procure our essential and basic needs. That‚Äôs how you conjure an angry, desperate, disengaged, population.

Easy to use and the functions are smooth. | Is amazing I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è | Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è | Hehe | capcut was so good and easy to use, but then they started making everything pro and theres like two good effects and transitions now. pro ruined it! what if a new editor wanted to try all the effects and get familiar with capcut for awhile and its all pro. from what ive heard, sometimes you dont even get all the effects with pro. | The reason why I‚Äôm giving a three stars I used to like this app, but now you have to pay for it. They have good stuff to edit, but you have to pay for it. Used to be free but now you have to pay for it. I don‚Äôt really like it much if you guys change that, I‚Äôll probably change my view, but it‚Äôs gonna stay at three because you have to pay some of the stuff I don‚Äôt know why they change it. It used to be free but now you have to pay that‚Äôs kind of messed up. | I think CapCut is amazing but no matter what I do it doesn‚Äôt let me login or create anything I‚Äôve uninstalled and downloaded it AGN I‚Äôve made sure I have enough storage I checked my WiFi . idk what I‚Äôm supposed to do | Top tier | June 19, 2023: You have a amazing app. I enjoy watching people‚Äôs creations, and making my own. But I really want to post, but I need CapCut pro. Is there anyway, you can make posting free? Thank you!\n\nMarch 15, 2024: LOVE IT SM!! So many things to create, although one worry is children talking to complete strangers. IDS should be changed to where you can‚Äôt use numbers! | I love the editing | Capcut's editing tools are like most other editing apps except they have available, even in the free versions (app or platform), more variety of free accessible tools which you would normally have to combine two or more editing apps to get.  I haven't used many of the free AI tools they now have or played much with all the other free accessible photo editing, AI text-to-video, or all the template features yet. Overall, Capcut most definitely has way more editing tools with many more various features available (with the majority of them accessible with the free versions) and with their newer platform, they also have cloud storage (which 5GB are available free but you can purchase how many you may need for your projects or business).  The downset, with most apps and platforms, are the download speed of some of the tools but that may just be my experiences on my devices being remotely controlled or malware hacking clogging up my device or connection speed (like local law enforcements and unentitled 'slackers' are notorious for, right!?! Who needs that in their virtual life, really?!?) | I can‚Äôt describe in words how good this app is, I make cool edits. | This is such a good editing app and even though pro caught money and I don‚Äôt like that but pro is worth it 100% | The app is really good and helps me make my videos a lot better | CapCut betterü•± | I love this app and I‚Äôm always making videos! But any time I‚Äôm watching one of my own templates I created, the screen turns black and I have to reload the app. Please fix this! Overall great experience | The app itself is absolutely amazing! But There is  one problem, the new premium stuff! If we want to send something to someone with the premium stuff, we end up not having premium! CapCut used to have everything for free, the fun CapCut stage! BUTTTTT! Now we can‚Äôt send ANYTHING to ANYONE with premium stuff! All the good stuff was made premium! Now we cannot send the good stuff to our friends! Only  like, ONE SINGLE THING that the community likes is not premium and it‚Äôs becoming a problem to the community! If this keeps up then the editing community of CapCut will soon start DYING.

I can‚Äôt add some old videos/clips to current videos I‚Äôm editing. other than that, there isn‚Äôt any problems. | Used to be good but then they decided it would be nice to add ads, n that took alot of people away form CapCut, and when u share the videos either to snap TikTok or even ur camera it‚Äôs delayed and blurry and horrible quality | Love CapCut ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | The only edit app I ever use and need!! | It‚Äôs a really good app and it has a good quality download it\n you guys | The best app ever | It‚Äôs allowed me to be able to add better quality videos to my TikTok.

It says they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt allow people to try to get likes, follows, shares or video views in a misleading way.‚Äù But none of my comments do this. \n\nExample:\nVideo of someone asking if we were siblings what I‚Äôd do, and I said I‚Äôd ask them to bring me wings and to protect me from bullies. \n\nHow is this me violating any guideline? Exactly. I‚Äôm not. & yet, I‚Äôm being told that if they keep having to remove my comments (which again is wrongfully done), then they have a right to remove my content from my profile. I can‚Äôt keep\nMy memories (again because of them) but \nthere are people spamming hateful things in comment sections that never get in trouble? How does this make sense? | Amigable, f√°cil, lo √∫nico es que cuando monto concierto de mi hija porque toca en la orquesta sinf√≥nica juvenil aqu√≠ en maracay estado Aragua venezuela ustedes siempre me lo quieren bloquear y que no lo podr√° ver nadie porque prohibido en cierto pa√≠s es y cada rato le comento no eso no fue grabado es ese pa√≠s es de mi autor√≠a | Commenting with a gif is my favorite thing about Instagram next to watching the reels. This app just keeps going from bad to worse! | Can‚Äôt do gif comments any longer | I recently unfollowed 25 people a day for a week to go through a detox and IG showed I had increased the number of people i was following. | Users receive new features much later than promised or never at all. Some accounts will have notes, some will not. Sometimes you can like notes, sometimes the feature disappears completely. Some accounts can have music on posts, some can not. I can go on and on, it‚Äôs been this way for years and it‚Äôs becoming very frustrating to use when the main reason for many of us having this app is to engage with our friends and family and post memories. There is too much of a focus on boosting influencer clones and controversies, not enough on making the experience better for personal accounts not interested in strangers. I am a teenager, but I expect people of other generations would feel the same. I‚Äôve seen hate in every public comment section and people commenting about how much meta is pushing grotesque content. We all see how this app has changed, please learn to clear up bullying, harassment, and reasonless hate. We don‚Äôt appreciate all the racist, homophobic, transphobic and misogynistic comments that get past your reporting system. We don‚Äôt appreciate comments joking about war and violence, about mental illnesses and health conditions, about people‚Äôs bodies, whether too thin or too big. And it‚Äôs especially frustrating when we try to censor certain words, avoid the miserable and disturbing comments, just to still see those posts and those miserable hateful people. We don‚Äôt need anymore negativity in this world, choose to be better when you have the influence and stability to do so. | my feed has been automatically set to the default feed with nature posts and basic feed, and i havent been able to fix it for over a month, i do not want to see those boring posts fix this issue. instagram has been declining tremendously with every new useless update it gets. | I can‚Äôt to login and signing :/ | instagram is just advertising that's it. ad after ad after ad. I rarely see actual posts anymore it's just so many annoying ads. And you can't turn them off, there's usually an ad after every post or every other post. Can I see posts and reels without ADS?!?!?!?!?!!?! PLEASE U HAVE ENOUGH MONEY | I‚Äôm tired of every other update messing with the comment section. I can‚Äôt send gifs in the comments at the moment and it‚Äôs super frustrating. It‚Äôs always something. | Instagram said i was going to be banned off from going live for one day but it‚Äôs been 4 weeks and i still cannot go live | They removed the ability to comment gif. Why??? This app always does something good and then makes it worse than before. | There‚Äôs a problem with me logging in, my account isn‚Äôt banned, not disabled, I reseted my password on your website and logged me back out on the app, when I tried logging in i kept getting ‚Äúsorry, there‚Äôs a problem with your request.‚Äù Please fix it | On the iOS app, there is a bug in stories. If you share a reel, the reels freezes at 15secs and viewers need to advance or wait out the freeze. It‚Äôs been reported for weeks now and no bug fix has been released. | Why would you remove the option to comment gifs. BRING BACK THE GIF IN THE COMMENTS. | It‚Äôs a wonderful app but they seem not to care about posts that are highly sexual and are reported but not taken seriously or care of. I don‚Äôt think instagram honestly cares at all. | The app is turning into addictive trash. I rarely spend time looking at friends‚Äô posts now. Instead I end up wasting hours watching trash content on reels. The inability of insta creators, unlike on YouTube, to upload worthwhile short form video is causing me to delete the app. I hope it gets banned like TikTok. | Can‚Äôt believe instagram allows scam ads to show on instagram.My steam account was almost hacked by the scam ads\nI thought ads on instagram was safe til I met the scam one.they tried to say that they are giving away keys for Black Myth,and then the website looks just like steam,when you login,you‚Äôll receive a message that gives you the code to remove your authenticator.\nhoping instagram can take notice of this review and take care of scam message. | Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è | The human mind isn‚Äôt designed to be surrounded by people who don‚Äôt actually give you lessons in success (their bodies and wealth are almost always the result of surgery, photoshop, and renting) and who won‚Äôt respond to any actual attempts at friendship. So this site creates the dopamine urge to look at the pretty people and things, but the frustration of not being able to benefit from or connect to any of it. That‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt smile while they use this thing and hate the people who created it. | You take away GIFs?  What kinda ABSOLUTE TRASH IS THIS? | I hate Instagram. They are horrible when it comes to peoples accounts. I literally got logged out of mines for no reason all I did was log in, I barley even post anything on there or even text people‚Ä¶ as soon as I open the app I get l logged out. I try logging in and Instagram will not let me for some reason, saying oh how my request to my own account was invalid (or the wifi) when the wifi is working perfectly fine with everything else. Then telling me the right password to \"My‚Äù account was the wrong password‚Ä¶ instagram is trash this is not the first time i‚Äôve been having problems with Instagram, i‚Äôm just about fed up now. Thanks For Nothing!. | it‚Äôs not letting me type gifs on instagram comments | Whats the point of someone sending you a link, if once you click the link, instagram loads another video or reel over the link that was just sent | Too many ads and suggestions. I rarely see any post from my people I follow despite having over 500 people I follow. Everyday all I see is you have seen all your post in the past 3 days. Has become boring | ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿßÿ®Ÿä Ÿäÿ™ÿπÿ∞ÿ± ÿ™ÿ≥ÿ¨ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿØÿÆŸàŸÑ ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÖŸà ŸÉŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπŸÑŸàŸÖÿßÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÑÿÆÿ∑Ÿàÿßÿ™ ÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠Ÿá ÿå ŸÖÿß ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÑÿü | Every other post or story is an ad. Sometimes it‚Äôs back to back ads. I am debating if I should just delete it at this point. Instagram used to be a great way to connect with people but I‚Äôm basically just being advertised to now. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even see what my friends post as often. | It‚Äôs a good and interesting app I use it all day | This app is so buggy. I love instagram but it opens random reels rather than the one intended. I‚Äôve sought solutions and cleared the cache, but it has not helped. I‚Äôve had to delete the app altogether and play them online in order for the correct reels to play. Yikes! | bring back gifs. | Updated and fresh install. The Gif option for comments is missing.ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èit was working yesterday. | There has been an issue saying there is an error while I try to login. It states there was a problem with my request but I know I haven‚Äôt done anything to warrant any sort of suspension. | I want an explanation, in what ways did my comments ‚Äúwent against the guidelines‚Äù? \nThe comments that you removed from my account makes no sense. Both contained nothing that went against the instagram guidelines. \n\nAlso, ‚Äúyou tried to gain likes, follows, [and etc]‚Ä¶‚Äù \nIn what ways have I done that? \nOne of the comments you restricted was me admiring artists‚Äô works, and another was me trying to find a language study partner. \n\nThis is ridiculous. \n\nThen you ‚Äúrestrict certain activities to keep instagram safe‚Äù \nAre you serious? \nIn what ways are me liking a reel/post, a harmful activity? \nIn what ways were my comments harmful? \n\nYou remove innocent comments but neglect homophobic and racist comments on instagram. \n\nThis is ridiculous. | Now that I‚Äôve realize that our government is super concerned about the buying and selling of my data because of their attempt to ban other social media apps, I‚Äôve recognized that Meta has been doing this all along. Who knows what foreign entities have my precious data, which could totally be a safety concern for those of us who value America! This app has some features I wish it didn‚Äôt. Honestly if you‚Äôre really worried about preserving democracy, and preventing foreign or adversarial entities from gathering our data, don‚Äôt use Instagram on your phone. Meta doesn‚Äôt protect your data at all. | Add back them or 1 star | After this latest update I no longer can post a GIF in comments??????? | I don‚Äôt have the Instagram notes feature on my account and have tried contacting Instagram many times with no response, tried various methods such as completely logging out, deleting instagram, and tried on a completely different and new phone to try to get Instagram notes on my account. | I have been having an issue for a good 3 weeks now with having my photos i want to post be overexposed. The brightness is turned completely up and i can‚Äôt do much about it. I try adjusting the settings but nothing is working. I need to be posting on my business account but the photos are not good. PLEASE FIX !!!! | I used to enjoy scrolling reels but the comment popping up t the start of every video is very annoying and distracting. | It‚Äôs toxic, it‚Äôs owned by meta and some of the greediest and most corrupt people on the planet, it steals your information :) | ŸÅÿØŸäÿ™ÿ¨ ÿ±ÿ®ŸÉŸÖ ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÜÿ≥ÿ™ÿßÿßÿßÿß | They constantly update the app and introduce more and more bugs making this app frustrating to use. Instagram should focus on its core features and stop trying to reinvent the wheel with all these non sense features trying to compete with others. | I have so many comments that get deleted for ‚Äúbeing offensive‚Äù when is leftist writing something about a topic I‚Äôm responding to. Not cursing at anyone and you all just censor things\n\nAlso why is it that all of the sudden a lot us don‚Äôt have access to add gifs anymore? | Will not support this company and brand that is part of the machine that bans healthy competition, stifles creativity and information sharing, harms small businesses and entrepreneurs. Delete all meta products from devices and will do the same with accounts if any sale/bans pass. | Instagram band so many account in Punjab India. There is no freedom of speech very bad. | I miss actually seeing my friends posts, I like the cool suggestions but I miss the old feel of actually staying connected with friends!! | It‚Äôs like a Nat or devil demon thing going on please stopALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Not able to comment gifs | First off, the algorithm is garbage, and I can only assume because of politicization. Secondly, I don‚Äôt believe people who have their settings so you can‚Äôt reply to them should be able to reply to other people. If you can‚Äôt handle taking comments, don‚Äôt give them. | I am not able to see my direct messages on instagram. I have tried reloading the message or reopening the app, using different WiFi and a different device but it still doesn‚Äôt work. I don‚Äôt know why but when people send me dms I get the notification but when I click on it or go to the dm I cannot see the message. Another thing is if I get the message it is over 24 hrs later or more! This is very frustrating and annoying and has been going on since I have gotten the app. I seriously do not know why this happens but I know other people may have this problem.","currentVersionScore":4.52548,"currentVersionReviews":88651,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a0/61/ac/a061acd3-7ed7-35a0-13ac-a32118d207f8/d3d261bd-e303-4e80-8f54-a9bc4f2cffb0_1_iOS_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b0/98/26/b09826c3-a337-44f7-e87c-77fa1a81513d/40a5bc7e-1a94-4758-b511-720a2e8e0584_2_iOS_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/cf/c4/26/cfc42668-92a3-21ed-2d54-95cbda1b81d2/526b8da8-e73d-4eea-bd5c-8c6fc1f09203_3_iOS_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2f/a6/fe/2fa6feb5-ef6a-c1f0-5b85-7cdaf4a513e9/d7d9ff31-3af2-47fb-936f-586acc292c08_4_iOS_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ca/1f/6f/ca1f6fd0-3cfc-2a51-e3bb-a6ace22f58f3/4ecc454b-ce45-4ff5-829e-c14cb5554a39_5_iOS_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4b/45/77/4b45771f-2d03-276e-72e0-7294b1caffa9/3fc44b70-449d-463d-a8b8-10dc337a5da5_6_iOS_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini","iPhone12-iPhone12","iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro","iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax","iPadAir4-iPadAir4","iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular","iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen","iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular","iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen","iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular","iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen","iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular","iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro","iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax","iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini","iPhone13-iPhone13","iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen","iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular","iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen","iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular","iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen","iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen","iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular","iPhone14-iPhone14","iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus","iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro","iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax","iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen","iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular","iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen","iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular","iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen","iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular","iPhone15-iPhone15","iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus","iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro","iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax"]}

He only uses messenger for his texting and I can‚Äôt get messenger on CarPlay. When will Meta or Facebook come up with an app for CarPlay? That would be great and make this an even better texting app. It‚Äôs decent in it‚Äôs ability now but doesn‚Äôt as a major platform yet conform to CarPlay that is available in most new vehicles. You‚Äôd think they would come up with an app for CarPlay. Are they intentionally going against Apple users? | I‚Äôm not getting notifications for marketplace messages | I use this app a lot it works great my only problem is in the themes.

I dont know what is happening | can‚Äôt contact | i have no idea why all of a sudden my audio when i send snaps isn‚Äôt there after the update | Snapchat does what it's supposed to do. I love this app. It does not do more, it does not do less. It does what it is supposed to do!! And I love it. | I had an account for about two years and I have never promoted alcohol or drugs on my stories or to other people. I went to Snapchat one day and it was locked for ‚Äúprohibited drug content‚Äù. What? I have never heard posted drug content! The only thing I can think of is when I shared my Instagram QR code on my story that had mushroom emojis on it. That is still ridiculous! \n\nI have been trying to appeal my account for five days now and Snapchat said they are usually aiding Snapchat users within 24-48 hours.

Ive been using it since 2018-2019 and still use it Filters are great and I like it because on Imessage you can text whoever and get the message and sometimes that‚Äôs not always good but on snap you have to add the person which I personally like because you can choose who you have and ik you can too on iMessage but at least you can add them and half swipe to see what it is instead of having to actually o-en the message. Not sure if what I said makes sense but whatever. Great app, don‚Äôt regret using like ever | This app is super inclusive and fun to use! Great filters and great ideas every step of the way!

I‚Äôve been to magnificent far away places, attended incredible concerts, seen art, watched great movies ,been part of safaris, enjoyed trips to all over the world, concerts at Carnegie Hall, climbed the Everest, visited rainforests ..and more, much more‚Ä¶.and all from the comfort of my couch . Thank you YouTube!!! | Sushi | ŸÜÿ¨ŸÖ | I‚Äôm not going anywhere else but I‚Äôm not going anywhere else to | We can get the girls to see what we are looking like in | Yo digo que esta aplicaci√≥n es muy buena porque reit√©rala mente puedes ver todo lo que quieras y ver como disfrutan las dem√°s personas y eso es asombroso es genial üôÉü§óamo esta aplicaci√≥nüòù | We can get the boys in and | Too negative! Keeps showing me videos I‚Äôve disliked! | It lets you purchase movies, but then doesn‚Äôt let you watch them because of age restrictions | Traaaaaaaaaash | So many ads on this platform these days to force people to pay for ‚Äúpremium‚Äù. | Please make an option to disable YouTube ‚Äúshorts‚Äù or hide them 1 star until then | Youtube is YouTube and I like youtube | We appreciate what you do! | There should be no premium because people are trying to watch things long distance but can‚Äôt and have no money, what if they are orphans and can‚Äôt afford it. Are you being racist? Email me as soon as you can because this is not good, this shouldn‚Äôt be allowed. I‚Äôm trying to watch youtube and videos but cannot. You know how bad this makes ur company look? No wonder people will rather watch reels and tiktok because your off brand shorts and ads, and paying for things that are unnecessary. I hope you and your family sleep good knowing other family‚Äôs are struggling and you are over there just making sure family‚Äôs that can‚Äôt afford YOUR OUTRAGEOUS price on youtube just to watch youtube or get a little better quality. This isn‚Äôt good for your company, your company will soon be shut down because tiktok and reels have taken over, youtube shorts are just not it. Premium is unnecessary to because what‚Äôs the actual point of it? I do not get why youtube needs money when they make enough money as it is. | It is very good to watch things. It kids safe. My daughter love youtube to watch her favorite shows. I love that it also give you a notifcation if your in youtube for a long time. I would really recommend this app. | YouTube have become unbearable multiple double ads explore page is full of shorts and the in the gaming tab if it‚Äôs not a short is a music video very disappointed in what it has become over the years and I hope truly hope that you can improve the services and have advertisers creators and consumers all benefit and have a nice ecosystem | Only Focuses on old topics, and forces you watch unstoppable ads. | YouTube is so good you can watch anything the best part shot of the Yeagers | I want to surf without being login apart from google\nI feedup i going\nTo delete this app i can't turn of cellular and watch on the webüòñ | I like to listen to audio books and sometimes the the read speed is a little too slow. Puts me to sleep. If I change the playback speed to 1.25x the audio gets distorted and all of a sudden the background music is horrible. Not sure what the fix is but it would be great if it were obvious. | ‚ÄúSomething Went Wrong‚Äù keeps popping up on all my videos when I try to play them. C‚Äômon YouTube, I even pay for premium and I can‚Äôt watch videos? What‚Äôs the point then? | It‚Äôs sooooooooooooooo.good you should get is ofcors  YouTube it good I spent like 24 hours or 70 minutes watching it\n                         On it\n10/10\n5 stars bye.!!!! | Demasiados anuncios \nM√°s el costo para evitarlos muy alto!!\nEs un total abuso !! Pienso que deben ser m√°s considerados | I like it | I love YouTube but the adds are getting out of hand. I don‚Äôt even want to watch it anymore because of the 45-60 second adds. please fix this and make it to where you can skip again after 5-10 seconds. | I live YouTube but the ads are popping up more and are longer. Sometimes if I am not paying attention I swear the ads are endless‚Ä¶for real!  The timer at the bottom just says 90+ secs. I hope its seconds but either way they just keep going if you don‚Äôt eventually press skip. Whatever!  Those guys at the top need their 47th Lamborghini right!! | I like | To many pedos chillin in here and being content creators. | Thank you for this | And ugly too | Almost always matches my interests | This app is good but YouTube should change some things they should remove the remix options because its annoying to get your content stolen and the second thing is that they should add more time to shorts because the limit is 1 minute they should make it a bit longer,overall a good app | It‚Äôs very skibidi fortnite Ohio rizz‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® | They say they fixed the bugs in the most recent update but I still can‚Äôt read any comments because they‚Äôre in the wrong color font.\nI know it‚Äôs not my phone, only on this app and only for the comment section. | Nice going | YouTube is awsome!\nYou can socialize with friends and family, have fun, and most of the time you need no internet! It‚Äôs an amazing app I would recommend for all people so just download it because it‚Äôs awsome better than any other content app like TikTok, Instagram, and the rest. | I feel old struggling to navigate. | I‚Äôm going back in a bit to see what the kids want me | I just like watching long form and short form videos sometimes I feel that nothing on my fyp is interesting or something I would watch | It‚Äôs enjoyable and fun | Everything about this app is screaming ‚Äúpay for premium access‚Äù\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt rotate when you turn your phone. It knows when to insert the commercial at the moment when it‚Äôs most annoying. The commercials they plug are so inaccurate to the context of the specific video it‚Äôs very obvious why they are doing it.\n\nGoogle is turning into a new CNN type of media that forces you into compliance. They demonetize channels they don‚Äôt like. \n\nI just wish there was an alternative. | If you have the attention span of a goldfish you should definitely download this app. Why? because you get entertained by videos and most importantly brain rotting shorts! Well whatever, great app Youtube. | YouTube has become my invaluable go-to source for news, analysis and useful info about my various hobbies and interests. | This app is the best you can watch videos and you can also have fun creating a YouTube channel and making videos and getting your subscribers. Have fun guys. YouTube is great. | YouTube in general is a great app saying how much you can learn, but YouTube is owned by google (owned by Zionists) and whenever I say anything against Israel my comment gets deleted also it‚Äôs to the point were it annoys me so much that I had to write a review. I tend to get into arguments because of how many uneducated people are on YouTube. I usually get banned for one day and then get banned right after; I believe that YouTube is a racist company because I cannot express my thoughts unlike the Zionist who can be racist in comments and won‚Äôt get banned. I said ‚Äúok so chanting ‚ÄòDeath to Arabs‚Äô  isn‚Äôt racist.‚Äô‚Äù The reason I said this was because someone said that Israel want racist‚Ä¶ | Regular YouTube is amazing but the only thing that could make it better is a way to toggle he shorts feature on and off in settings | Love her and this song | Its frustrating that I've tried to unsubscribe some channels that I never did in the first place but can't seem to get rid of.

This is a bit obnoxious when it comes to trying to play a very specific genre of song. | Help me to relax every time I listened to music from Spotify. | Why can‚Äôt I just listen to the song I want?

I HATE this app now. This used to be the best music app in the WORLD. But now I have to pay to listen to one specific song from my playlist? This is outrageous.

I even turned off audio normalization and it didnt fix the problem. | Nice Music | This is the best app I used for music | Omgggggggggg it is the best it barely has any adds even if you do not get premium it has great playlist and so enjoyable fun | Don‚Äôt want to give a bad rating but I can‚Äôt play my podcasts that are for today even though they have already been uploaded.

Nice & clean car. Took good short way to our destination.  \nVery respectful driver who answers all our questions we asked. Good & fair price for our trip. I will always use it when I am in France. \nThank you | Most of the drivers asks you to cancel the ride if they don‚Äôt like it , i was with my wife and no one wanted to pick us up and it only was 9 pm at the downtown center plus you cant contact the support , it is very annoying | Thanks for the promo free ride for starters. Great service. Will ride it again | My first ride with this car service did not disappoint. Reliable service and clean car. I‚Äôll use it for the rest of my stay in Luanda. Congrats to the developer. | Disrespectful conditions towards drivers | Chauffeur l3zizzza | Great web to order Texi | ÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ŸÖÿ™ŸàŸÅÿ± ŸÅŸä ŸÑŸäŸÑ | The worst taxi app I have ever used. I tried it tree times: few number of available taxis, driver always call to check price, drivers always unhappy with price given, drivers refuse to cancel and keep the app running forever without canceling nor coming. Can you tell me what‚Äôs even worse than that? | You cannot even log into the app without WiFi. All attempts with an account or third party log in fail on a cellular connection with ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù as the only comment. I contacted customer service about a bad driver that refused pickup and refused to cancel and had to rebook at a higher price and the only reply was that they would talk to the driver. They offered no compensation for the increase in fare. Try Yango. It actually works. | Go | All I know is yesterday was first and last time using it. The driver took such a long route, left my house at 4pm and had to get off the car at 6:48 to get another ride. Who takes the industrial zone route from HLM to get to Maristes? Ughhhh | First time riding Nicement machalla | Service rapide, prix raisonnables, chauffeurs g√©n√©ralement sympathiques | My first ride was awesome \nGreat service | The application is in English, but the drivers speak no English?\nThe drivers always call to ask where you are and then as you to cancel or pay extra if the distance is in a high traffic area. \nTerrible service, with some gems of taxis in between. | This app is not working at all | Nous avons d√ª commander 3 fois  un Heetch XL et  2 Toyota Prius et une Citro√´n C4 nous ont √©t√© envoy√©es en lieu et place des van! Ce n‚Äôest pas la premi√®re fois que √ßa arrive!!! | Le probl√®me c‚Äôest que le chauffeur n‚Äôest jamais localis√© ou le point GPS l‚Äôindique. Je ne sais pas comment ‚Ä¶ mais √† chaque fois que j‚Äôutilise l‚Äôapplication le chauffeur m‚Äôappelles pour me dire qu‚Äôil est en faite dans un autre quartier que celui indiqu√©, ou qu‚Äôil n‚Äôa pas encore quitt√© son domicile et qu‚Äôil sera en route dans 10 minutes, etc‚Ä¶ | More and more drivers ask to cancel the ride under the pretext that the app is frozen on their end so they can offline. Or they simply never show up. This kind of uncertainty makes me not want to use this service anymore. Otherwise, it could be a 5 star. | This is the closest thing to Uber or Lyft here in Dakar, Senegal. It‚Äôs way better than taking a raggedy, hot taxi. I definitely recommend! Be sure to have near correct cash. Also the drivers don‚Äôt really know English, so beware and ready with your Google Translate app. | Tem sido comum, n√£o ter\nMotoristas dispon√≠vel de sexta-feira a domingo.

However, on iOS the service relies on Apple Maps, which is completely barren where I live. It‚Äôs just not possible to find your destination on the map, thus making the app useless. Back to the competitors that all use Google Maps‚Ä¶ | En angola es muy mala , no te dice la ubicaci√≥n real de los taxis , te dice un precio primero y despu√©s otro para el mismo lugar , en fin no la recomiendo nada | Estou satisfeito com a aplica√ß√£o e o vossos servi√ßos. Motoristas t√™m se mostrado bastante respons√°veis e muito atenciosos. \nMotoristas h√° que de quando em vez se apresentam com a viatura com um n√≠vel baixo de asseio, gostaria que voc√™s focassem nesse ponto.

Then a new policy added more options to be verified and this means Heetch is listening to its customers. And the drivers are polite, considerate and professional. And more discounts than any other company in DZ - actually other companies are now imitating Heetch, which is good for customers. I am glad I am back. | A great and useful app | Good | The map is not precise, it takes forever to make an order and ages to get a car | It'd be awesome if you enable other ways to sign-up/log-in, i believe a mobile phone number or a scan of National ID Card would do it for you easier for those who doesn't want to use Facebook or doesn't own one in the first place, Good luck ^_^ | Mauvaise application pour prendre un taxi. La majorit√© des chauffeurs ont un num√©ro de t√©l√©phone hors service, en plus m√™me si tu commande un taxi le chauffeur te r√©pond pas et t‚Äôas aucun feed back sur ta commande. Tu reste bloqu√© en attendant un miracle | No thank you. Im not providing any payments via Facebook. | Really a Good service | Nice app and convenient \n- I had once a free ride but the driver still charged me for it. I contacted the customer service but no one cared \n- today I had to go fast to the train station and when the driver came he refused to pick me up because I have a cat ( in its cage ofc) \n- still have other stories but the bottom line, I won‚Äôt rely on this app anymore. I guess it‚Äôs time to discover other offers. | Since you require a Facebook login, you have made the poor decision to align yourself with a company that has no regard for our data and privacy. Sorry, but we cannot do business that way! | the app and its platform need some address-level adjustment that does not display properly for the customer and creates misunderstandings with the driver and then the drivers need to understand that a Heetch customer is not obligated to accept another passenger in his reservation | The driver was rude and took me 4 Km away from my destination and asked me to pay more because of his mistake, i ended alone at 3AM lost. | When the driver, ignored my request !! I can‚Äôt cancel him!!

Get the whole city in your hands, ride wherever you want, and enjoy comfort at an affordable price. With Yango, everything is possible!\n\nChoose the right service class for you\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Economy is awesome for when you need a ride fast. Comfort lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride. And The Fastest is the best in case when the service class doesn‚Äôt matter and you just need the closest ride available!\n\nRide safely\nSafety is our top priority. You‚Äôll see who‚Äôs coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You‚Äôll see info about the driver, such as their name and rating, and will be able to share your route with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\nYango will suggest destinations for your rides based on your ride history, like first offering ‚Äòhome‚Äô as a destination because it‚Äôs your most common request on weekday evenings. Ride the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\nYango makes everyday life super easy. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. \n\nRequest rides for close ones\nShow you care by requesting rides for friends and relatives. Get your mother to a doctor‚Äôs appointment, book a ride to pick up your special someone, or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can request up to 3 cars at once.\n\nRefer friends and get discounts\nInvite friends to try Yango and save together. Share your personal promo code, get a discount on your next ride and grant your friend with an extra discount on their first ride. It‚Äôs as easy as that.\n\nMeet Delivery - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier anywhere in the city. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car. \n\nAn international service\nYango is a ride-hailing, mobility, and delivery aggregator service that operates in more than 20 countries around the world, including Norway, Finland, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties.\nThe size and duration of the discount for the first rides requested via the Yango app vary depending on the country and city.

As long as they pay for advertising, they can advertise anything.\n\nMy WhatsApp worked perfectly and was encrypted but something happened in an update that allowed me to use my APPLE IPHONE 13-pro to save my password and allow my facial recognition to open my WhatsApp‚Ä¶.   When the next update/bug fix updated my phone, my password was gone, I had to change my Apple password and that created an error for Apple to forget my Whatsap password or WhatsApp now required me to remember the password which I could not, and Whatsap refuses any customer service. I just lost a $15,000 commission because Apple and WhatsApp keep no password, therefore you have no way to recall people, chats, quotes, invoices, etc‚Ä¶.  And WhatsApp does not answer emails or messages.  They lie about getting back to you. They also lock you out longer, every time you enter an incorrect guess at your password..

One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 800 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don‚Äôt need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie‚ÄìHellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content ‚Äî messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don‚Äôt wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram ‚Äî join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula","icon":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/71/78/b5/7178b53f-d038-836e-617c-70d54d8b1ad1/AppIconLLC-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","genres":["Social Networking","Productivity"],"genreIds":["6005","6007"],"primaryGenre":"Social Networking","primaryGenreId":6005,"contentRating":"17+","languages":["AR","BE","CA","NL","EN","FR","DE","ID","IT","KO","MS","FA","PL","PT","RU","ES","TR","UK","UZ"],"size":"158901248","requiredOsVersion":"12.0","released":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","updated":"2024-03-09T23:20:12Z","releaseNotes":"Bug fixes, minor improvements, and more.","version":"10.9.2","price":0,"currency":"USD","free":true,"developerId":686450210,"developer":"Telegram FZ-LLC","developerUrl":"https://apps.apple.com/ao/developer/telegram-fz-llc/id686450210?uo=4","score":3.95674,"reviews":"It started out when I would click on a contact and the app would freeze and now I can‚Äôt even open the app. I‚Äôm also on the latest software update.

I tried to download a song but it didn‚Äôt do? It would be nice if the box of wanting to download would be back, for no more problems for people who don‚Äôt know. | Ser√≠a de buena que la app pudiera hacer como una cu√°nto para cuando cambies de tel o borrar la app puedas volver a bajarla y tengas lo que ten√≠as anterior mente muchas gracias | Fantastic üëåüèæ | Muchos anuncios | Rien √† dire sur votre apps trop bien ! | I o ok b in in I u h  de ft iii I t to ok in | No se me descarga nada de YouTube me da error | 0203pesao | La nouvelle version ne fonctionne plus sur iPhone 6, merci de bien vouloir y rem√©dier. | Cool | I have a iPhone 6 with 12.5.7 iOS and after update the app close after trying to open ir | Title.

While the app appears to offer a promotional first year subscription with a requirement to subscribe within seven days (and an actual countdown of the days), it appears it is not valid if you downloaded and used the free app more than once (no response from developer). If you can take the time to add a promotional countdown, you should take the time to explain when the promotion is or is not valid. | Deber√≠a venir como por defecto | Lo mejor k he probado lo m√°ximo | Muy buena | Me gusta si, pero p√°renle a tanto anuncioü•∏ | This is a good file manager app but I quickly realized that it looked very familiar - now I know why: it is ‚Ä¢identical‚Ä¢ to ‚ÄúTotal Files‚Äù by ‚ÄúApp Ideas.‚Äù Take a look and you will see - it‚Äôs the same app. If there are any differences, I couldn‚Äôt find them.

Beyond frustrating!!! Would not trust!! | Good app | I‚Äôm noticing my phone working better with more space. | This app is completely ineffective.  Save your money and try something else. | I have tried several times to cancel this subscription. PLEASE cancel me today.\n\nThank you,\nEvelyn Hudson | Hello, downloaded your app. Didn‚Äôt really let me see anything other than payment options. Not gonna pay unless I get to see and try it at least 1 time.  Maybe less of the money grab . I‚Äôm just saying | I downloaded this app in the hopes it would consolidate my contacts, clean them up. Instead, my contacts now are a complete mess! I‚Äôm calling people with different names, I can have up to 4 numbers for one contact and 3 of them are wrong. Devastated. I will have to go through the painful task of going through my contacts one by one. I wish I never downloaded it. Very regretful. | Works well seems to clean up everything | Very frustrating went to Apple first to get a refund for something I didn‚Äôt want and now going through your email system. You guys cannot find it. Very frustrating to be charged for something I don‚Äôt want. | Excelente opci√≥n para quienes buscan limpieza r√°pida üëçüëç | What to do on this app isn‚Äôt entirely clear! When I went to cancel my trial, the ‚Äúproceed with cancellation‚Äù button doesn‚Äôt work! DO NOT CHARGE ME!!! Left you feedback and have gotten no response. So again I say, do not charge me!!! Cancel my subscription instead! | Very easy to use would recommend | Amazing app | Love it | Exelente aplicaci√≥n f√°cil de usar | Use less | Makes me pay for mostly  everything | This is no better than just deleting photos from your native app. The pictures it pairs up are often very different, so if you trust the app to clean it‚Äôs going to wipe a ton of photos you‚Äôd rather keep. So if you go through and uncheck what you want to keep, it‚Äôs probably slower than just doing the same in your photo app. Especially since the ‚Äúselect all/unselect all‚Äù doesn‚Äôt actually work.  No way would I ever pay money for this app. | helpful to clean out space on my phone Is now it even works better after deleting all duplicates l. | You took money out of my account! Four transactions! One for 4.99, 6.99, .99, and 6.99. The trial was free for 7 days! Dishonesty is not rewarded in the end? Please put my money back! I have canceled the subscription! | Excelente ayuda | I like it so far. I‚Äôve deleted tons and made so much space. Awesome app! | Literally the app won‚Äôt let me cancel as the button on mine doesn‚Äôt work | The app is completely ineffective! I tried it, it fixed the issue for about 15 minutes & then the storage issue went immediately back to were it was before I had used this app. The comdensing video option where it claims to be ‚Äúworking magic‚Äù, & you‚Äôre instructed not to close the app had been ‚Äúworking it‚Äôs magic (unsuccessfully of course)‚Äù for 45 minutes on ONE video before i fonally gave up on it ever completing this simple task & closed the app. This product has a lot of great claims & would be amazing if ANY of the features actually worked as promised & advertised!! But they don‚Äôt, hence rendering it completely useless & utter garbage! I do NOT recommend wasting your time or money purchasing this app, its all lies. | Seems to work with a click of a button. So far so good! | It says ‚Äúclean up duplicate photos ‚Äú in the ad but does not offer this option!! It has ‚Äúclean up similar photos ‚Äú. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I don‚Äôt want an app to decide which shot is better. And I only had one duplicate content. Plus- even if you order free it automatically signs you up for free trial which automatically starts BILLING you after seven days! I immediately deleted app and I have tried 87 times but there is NO WAY to cancel subscription before trial starts!!! There better be a way soon!!! Don‚Äôt waste your time and money. | We usually postpone simple tasks such as reviving screenshots and duplicate pictures, and you don't know how much storage you are wasting there! And even if you have the space, why save things you don't need? | Fast | Easy to use and helps clean up ur phone | This feels incredible. Thank you! | Loved it. Super quick and easy! | I was happy to delete close to 6000 duplicate pictures | Simply amazing. Wish I found it earlier. | Would be nice if it worked as well as advertised - please cancel my subscription | I love it you got to have it | It worked well, very easy to use. | How do I restore my contacts | What a great app. Cleared my phone very easily. | As a consumer who values efficiency and reliability, I was thoroughly disappointed by my experience with Cleaner Guru. From the moment I downloaded the app, it failed to live up to its promises.\n\nFirstly, the user interface is clunky and unintuitive. Navigating through the app felt like a chore, with poorly labeled buttons and confusing menus.\n\nSecondly, the supposed cleaning features of Cleaner Guru were ineffective at best. After running multiple scans, it barely identified any unnecessary files or junk on my device. It seemed more like a placebo effect than an actual optimization tool.\n\nMoreover, the app bombards users with intrusive ads at every turn. Pop-ups constantly disrupt the user experience, making it nearly impossible to accomplish anything without being interrupted.\n\nLastly, the customer support was non-existent. I attempted to reach out for assistance with my issues, but received no response whatsoever.\n\nOverall, Cleaner Guru is a complete waste of time and storage space. I would strongly advise against downloading it and instead look for a more reputable and reliable cleaning app. | I am in the middle of selecting my videos or photos to delete & it shuts down. Happened almost every time. Extremely frustrating! | Love this App | Me gust√≥ üòä | User-friendly! So glad I found this app! | I absolutely hate cleaning my phone for storage and that‚Äôs where Cleaner Guru comes in! It saves me the headache that comes with trying to delete one thing at a time. I highly recommend! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | So I have over 1500 photos on my phone but this app only accessed 85. Basically useless to me had to still delete duplicates manually | This is a decent app, that does what it claims. However, it‚Äôs a bit deceptive to have the $6.99 as a weekly charge, not a monthly charge. There are 100 apps out there they can do the exact same thing-help you clean up your storage. My suggestion is to use one of those, or buy this one for a week, and then cancel the subscription. | I can‚Äôt afford this and when I try to end subscription it won‚Äôt allow me to. PLEASE END MY SUBSCRIPTION!!! | Super user friendly! Separates by categories!  It works! I gained 9g of storage immediately!

I got a message saying my address wasnt valid but other times when i order things i never had that problem. The message gave me a link to go to BUT the link DIDNT work. I want my package or my money back. This is unaccpetable. One star. | My mom acts like we promote shrine I hate that app it can full down a ditch and roll down a staircase and instead of TikTok being banned shein should be this ugly app I wish the person who made it go full in a ditch with the dumb app my mom acting like I‚Äôm one of the models promoting their clothes | The clothes are a hit or miss.  Sometimes they can be decent quality and other times they are absolutely awful.  The games on this app, you can never win.  They make it almost impossible.  I‚Äôm very frustrated with this app. | I was a loyal customer love your product,but when I never received my product that was delivered to the wrong address,and how that happened I don‚Äôt know because everything else was delivered to me no one ever got in touch with me you guys just blow it over like that was my lost ,so you get no more business from me or my friends or family, and I will be posting on media also about my experience with your company | undefined\nI love good deals as much as the next person. But that being said, I don‚Äôt love Shein or inexpensive things that fall apart after the first use. And with Shein, you get what you pay for: low-cost, trendy clothes that can be hit or miss when it comes to actual quality. It‚Äôs the online-only equivalent of mall stores like Forever 21 and Charlotte Russe. I‚Äôd recommend pieces shopped at Shein for those fun items you only plan to wear a handful of times, like a party dress or a graphic tee. | Everything there is low quality. Customer service is not responsive and SO RUDE. Better go to your Walmart or Target nearby | SHEIN took my money after i canceled my order so for the people who want to get stuff from do what you do but I will not be buying anything from again | Nffb | They have thing that should not be one here so that should be removed right now at 2:41and idc what u say SHEIN so ugly | I ordered some clothes off of this app and I have not received my package even though it says it has been delivered. I followed the instructions it say of when you don‚Äôt receive a package and I have contacted USPS and they didn‚Äôt help, I waited for two days to make sure there wasn‚Äôt a mistake and still nothing, so then I contacted SHEIN customer service and was no help either. It has been almost a week and still no sign of my package and I am disappointed. | Svsv | Shhs | Svvs | TWe iyou | My first order of clothes was kind of a disappointment. One of the dresses I ordered was not made like the picture. It was actually a cheap material and came out ugly I couldn‚Äôt even use it. \n\nDespite that I was actually excited for my bigger order that I recently placed. I had all kinds of items in my cart saved and some were in sale so I thought it would be the perfect time to get a big haul of things. I wanted to get things from clothes to household organizers, shoes, glasses, the whole shebang. So I actually ordered some organizers that were on sale to come in before my other items that I will be using it for. On top of ordering it first to ensure I get it on time I also used the ‚Äòexpedite shipment‚Äô option that was available. All was good for maybe a week. A few days after my order was approved it said it was shipped out to me and on its way. Well today I was very surprised when in my email I read that I had a refund that was approved and in progress. It was my organizers. After doing some reading on the site it said it was due to not having my item and they didn‚Äôt receive a back up choice. Nobody ever sent me any notification to pick anything. I wasn‚Äôt even notified that a refund was in progress, only after it was approved! How could it be due to no inventory if mines was shipped days ago with tracking information ?!? I am furious at the fact that I was checking everyday for updates on my shipment that was not even real?? How can I even trust the integrity of anything else on this site? So now here is my next issue, I got the items on sale which is why it was in my budget to buy. I am able to repurchase this item but not for the sale price anymore even though it wasn‚Äôt my fault this whole refund issue happened. So basically SHEIN said screw you and there‚Äôs nothing you can do. I am very upset at this situation. Beware when buying on this site. | SHEIN I really hope you get shut down.Starting from how you treat your workers,to how many designs you steal it‚Äôs just funny how you won‚Äôt admit something everyone knows already.i can say i did used to shop from you but starting today I‚Äôm buying from stores that are way more kind. | I love the prices and style of clothes but something i‚Äôm VERY bothered about are sets. Like a skirt that comes with a shirt etc. I‚Äôm a L/XL in my bottoms cuz my hips and bum.. then i‚Äôm a S/M in tops. But when buying sets you are only able to choose one size. If i choose a large then the top will be way too big for me or a small or medium then bottoms will be too small. Please make it so we can choose the size of the tops AND bottoms | The only thing SHEIN needs to do in have plus size like 5XL 6XL like a size 26 and up please SHEIN includes actual plus size thank you other then that 10/10 | The app glitches. I called customer support and no one would help me. Two weeks of issues with the app and still no one has helped me. They just ask another question so it looks like they are working on the ticket but they don‚Äôt actually do anything. They will probably continue to loop with these questions for the next 10 years if I let them. They don‚Äôt actually try to help you in any way. I ordered something and it didn‚Äôt fit and they would not let me return it. The sizes are way out of whack. I normally wear a large. I‚Äôve bought a few of their things, sometimes small fits, sometimes medium, sometimes large. There is no consistency in sizing. THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! | I have just recently made a perchase and I wanted some other stuff right? I asked for a refund and did not get my money back! But overal the clothes are cute the sizes are pretty confusing \"14 yrs // 15 yrs ect\" like cant we just go off of \"XXS XS S M L XL XXL\"?? Anyways thats just my opinion, everything else is super cute! Recommend you buying their clothes, Me and my family are going to LA Hollywood and shein picked the right fits for me!! Thanks Shein XX ü§çü§ç!!! But I Would still like my money back ü§ç! | Its a 1 star because I ordered my product for 9$ but the day it was supposed to come in it didn‚Äôt  it was about 3 months since this happened and never came in | I love there clothes. Never have a problem with SHEIN. I have had a double Mastectomy & I especially love the smocked dresses  they fit my body much better. I tell everyone about your clothes. | Tengo mucho tiempo comprando en SHEIN, pero en mi √∫ltimo pedido lo han enviado con una empresa ‚ÄúONTRAC‚Äù desde el d√≠a 03-03-2024 ellos han tenido mi paquete, y a√∫n no se nada del mismo, empresa lenta y torpe con nuestros pedidos, no he podido contactarme con dicha compa√±√≠a ya que los n√∫meros de contactos emitidos no sirven‚Ä¶ y ni que decir de todas las referencias que tienen, todos se quejan de su p√©simo servio, paquetes que nunca llegaron a sus due√±os.

If you do ‚Äúwin‚Äù, they don‚Äôt even give it to you. I have friends who have hit and never received any prize and they also have banned me for whatever reason when I‚Äôve been giving out referral codes. They get more people to join the app but don‚Äôt give anything in return. | They have stolen designs that people work hard to develop and they steal their hard work. They also have workers that barely get payed. Shein is just a greedy company that only wants money and doesn't care about it's customers or workers. | I like this app but really disappointed that you will be discontinuing the daily gift minigame I would stay up all night till 12 AM to play that game.

Thank-you. | Best way to send mail ‚Ä¶always arrives | I love the whole google workspace, I have my work files and school files on my drive and email is simple and easy! | Need to fix happen to buy space so soon | Gmail is the only app I use for email purposes. I‚Äôve tried other apps and browsers, but Gmail is by far the best. Easy to use, clean layout, and great organization. | So ever since I updated my gmail app on my iOS device it will keep popping up ‚Äú You have a new message‚Äù and I want to keep seeing the emails to preview on my notifications. Help? Please? | Great email. Always has been. | I need Gmail for school, so I decided to get it on my iPad as well as my phone. However, there is no way to sign in on my iPad for some reason. It tells you to sign in, then brings you to a manage accounts screen. From there, nothing happens when you click on the account you want. Please fix this, Google. | I LOVE GOOGLE MAPSSSS PERIOD AH PERIOD UH | I‚Äôve been around since day ONE of internet, let alone having an email.\nYou‚Äôd be a fool to not have one. \n\nIt‚Äôs the most secure and easy to use email service I‚Äôve ever experienced and I still have stacks of ‚ÄúAOL discs‚Äù in my closet for nostalgia. | Only rating 1 star because I want Gmail to direct my Google Classroom emails to Google Classroom instead of directing me to it through my browser which is really annoying and inconvenient. | I wish this app would let me easily attach actual files from my device local storage or pull copies from google drive. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to do this when replying to an email on an Apple device. I can only share files in Google drive which is not how I want to send attachments. Fix this problem and I‚Äôll update to five stars. | Until you are able to paste and remove formatting this app is useless. It‚Äôs almost as if the people who developed this app have never used it themselves as a daily driver. Nowadays emails are crafted with a lot of copy and pasting and there should be a way to paste as text only or to highlight and remove all formatting. All emails from this app look like a garbled mess. The one and only reason I use this app is because they took away push/exchange connections. | I can‚Äôt connect my Microsoft about to my Minecraft PlayStation account, when it tells me to authenticate, you guys don‚Äôt send it to my authenticator app so I have no way to get my account back. On Top of that, why is it so difficult to sign into an account for Minecraft? That‚Äôs very unreasonably overly secure thing to do | I can‚Äôt fathom anyone making the process of getting into an email account so difficult. Terrible | I get on and someone send fart sound tracks to me | Ablkv | The Classic notification sound has recently disappeared and my devices now use the Welcome sound by default and I am missing important emails because I cannot hear the Gmail app notifications. All of the currently available built-in Gmail app sounds are either too low volume or too short in duration to be heard properly. This is causing an accessibility issue that was not a problem when the Classic sound was available to be selected as it was louder and easier to hear. Google Support pages show that the Classic sound should still be an option but it is not listed in the app anymore. Please bring it back and make the Classic sound available as an option again or let us use the built in default iOS system sounds as the current sound options cannot be heard very well. | Some times unsubscribed items are repeatedly coming to my email. | Listen Gmail the reason I‚Äôm mad is because whenever I create a gmail account and it works for only 24 hours and then the next day when I was about to post on my YouTube channel it says ‚Äúwe suspected a usually activity‚Äù and it signed out my YouTube channel and I know the password to itüò° so when it says enter a verification phone number I did and it says this number can not be used for verificationüò°! And I tried a different one but none working! FIX IT! Just a 5 stars bc if you guys fixed it then the five stars earned | Tienen demasiada publicidad\nY no hay forma de bloquearlo\nP√©sima si no te gusta perder tiempo | good relations | I really like having google mail it‚Äôs so easy to use. | N\\A No I don‚Äôt care to write a review. | Good | They‚Äôre price gouging. I recently switched from a google phone to an iPhone and immediately had no storage. The storage for google photos and gmail and documents are on the same storage and they just want to get you for a subscription. Now I have to find a new email because I‚Äôm not giving them money monthly. Especially when my inbox always has space for ads. | I like the email as a whole wish it was more intuitive with blocking spam and junk.  No way to block senders.  Want to be able to control the flow of info easier. | Man, the customer service from the man I spoke with today was the most helpful ever-and a cool dude.  Thanks. Keep up the good work!! | It would be nice to be able to apply themes on the gmail app, and also to have more than a dozen options for notification sounds. | Todo est√° perfecto | This salon is the best around!! Hana is always happy and does a great job! Highly recommend this professional store!!! | With the amount of tracking Google does there is no way I‚Äôll keep any Google product on my phone.\n\nGoogle keeps tabs on your who you email most frequently and there is no way to turn the feature off. There‚Äôs no way that they won‚Äôt mine your data to make money. They have no interest in your privacy. | Any reason why we cannot get an actual DARK MODE and not A GRAY MODE. Everyone else has TRUE true dark mode on their apps | Need better safety protocols and measures | I‚Äôm not receiving emails and my storage isn‚Äôt full | No way to stop TO suggestions. Icon-littered suggestions. Screen clutter! Awkward item attach. FIX IT. Tedious account swap: no unified folders. (App support? ü§£) Fast, mostly stable. Easy Report Spam, Block Sender! Easy swipes, Spam/Trash Empty. Multi folders (er‚Ä¶‚Äùlabels‚Äù). | I absolutely love gmail service it‚Äôs more than email I can video family states away I can budget things save photos etc even though I now have a iPhone I will always stick with google | Jajajaja | Let‚Äôs me be organized and let‚Äôs me know if anyone is yawing my account 5/5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Fast reliable great service | Trying to use the Gmail app. Insists on 2-step verification. The only thing is, it insists I use the Gmail app to verify it‚Äôs me. What. The. Hey?  Every time I select ‚Äòtry another way‚Äô it does the exact same thing. No way around or to even get help. Who‚Äôs the genius behind this? They deserve a bit of downtime to think things over, no? | Google why did you remove the banner from this update, now we can‚Äôt see the email unless you go to your email, come on please fix this, there‚Äôs no to check every junk email in order to see what email we have | Great service. The driver messaged me & brought my package to the door of my 100 unit apartment complex. Prompt and professional. | Google, what‚Äôs going on with my mail coming through. App is updated, but there is a lag. I have to push down the top of page before it loads new emails.

I use it all the time and it‚Äôs fun to know who is singing what and the title. | 10% | Apps stopped working. I‚Äôve done everything put it on take it off. Apple tried to help. I can‚Äôt add anything to my playlist anymore and I can‚Äôt play anything through Apple Music it‚Äôs not working can you please help me?\nIs still not working right? I cannot add any song from Shazam to my Apple playlist it still not working right I‚Äôm not happy about that. | Una de las mejores aplicaciones üëçüëçüëç | LOVE IT | Shazam on my android (same accounts) has offline mode, where I can Shazam a song when I don't have internet connection and when I connects, Shazam will automatically run the recorded song and find me the song. But on my iPhone, it's a different story altogether. If you try do it without network, it won't work and it makes me I have a burden of carrying two phones when the iPhone is my daily drive. Pls fix this issue pls Shazam. | Recognizes nothing worthwhile. There is more to music than pop forty. | I‚Äôm enjoying the app I like to read most music with lyrics | The best app ever | No matter what I‚Äôm doing I‚Äôm always able to get my phone out and nab the sick track I randomly hear while I‚Äôm standing in line at the store. It has even been really good at picking up obscure tracks of house music. An app I take for granted I think. It has helped bring so many new and exciting sounds into my life and that makes me happy. Love this app! | My friend introduced me to Shazam on a vacation in Germany.  Cant believe I hadn‚Äôt known about it before. I use it all the time, particularly when I like a song from a movie or TV series.

Took us exactly where we needed to go! Thank you Google Maps, Kevin and Dawn B | The new UI updates seems to have removed the option to add multiple stops, or made it too hard to find. | We can go in a little later than later but we will | A a | Ordered a ft long multigrain w/ provolone,lettuce,spinach,banana peppers, green peppers black olives,vinegar Palmerton PA location on Thursday March 14 at 3:15 pm. Ingredients were sparse & roll overwhelming.  Tasted awful. First time ever having a Subway sandwich didn‚Äôt like at all üòü | this is the most useful gps on this planet i never took a wrong turn because this app helped a lot i don‚Äôt get the ppl who say it‚Äôs horrible guys it perfect never missed my destination and i barley know we‚Äôre i‚Äôm going on the road but this app comes in and helps thx google maps and take that 1 star reviews | After 45 minutes of getting confirmation, the order went through, my order had not even been started. Went to restaurant, and they told me to be another 20 minutes before they started, however; I was told to expect 18 to 26 minutes from the time I place my order. | Thank you to our delivery driver, Milo, who took the extra time and care to read our instructions for delivery. He was attentive, patient kind and friendly. Thank you so much for delivering food for our family! | Last update is terrible. Changed everything about my maps!!!  Fix it!!!! | You can no longer use the website for all the features, so they demand that you download the app. Then the app stops working and it‚Äôs a waste. Either fix your app or let me use the features online. Google needs to improve it majorly if they want it to be a good maps app. | even though i had selected a specific route, it changed the route midway without notification or consent, took me on a less efficient, more miles and toll road!!! | good coffee | Used to be a great app. Howler any time I search an address now I have to go to the app store and update the app. After that instead of routing me to my destination I then have to go back to google and search for the destination for a second time. This is extremely annoying especially when you are driving and need directions asap. Not only is it not convenient it is also dangerous to have to complete so many steps while driving just to get directions somewhere. | Hdhsaia | When I am using google maps on my iPhone15, the voice directive never work reliably. Voice was out in some cases but not the others. Yes I know the voice option in the app is enabled at the time. | I‚Äôm not sure if this is accurate I am trying to find out | Every time I touch the screen to scroll through the map, it randomly drops a pin. Every time. Not sure why this latest update is so sensitive, but I hope this gets fixed. | I'm downgrading google maps to one star because there is a new AI search box that I can't get rid of, and it sits covering the lower lefthand side of my screen. Make it go away! It's in my way and it's super annoying. | Because it‚Äôs the BEST!!! | I recently purchased a Lexus RX 450 H from THOMPSON‚Äôs Lexus of Doylestown, and I couldn't be happier with my experience. Anne Killila was my salesperson, and she was fantastic. She was knowledgeable, patient, and really took the time to understand my needs. When it came time to finalize the transaction, Sharon She was not pushy at all and presented great additions that I took advantage of to enhance my purchase. Overall, I highly recommend THOMPSON‚Äôs Lexus of Doylestown and Anne Killila for anyone in the market for a new vehicle. Great customer service all around! | it lies, completely. said my trip would take 23 minutes. left at 9:20 for 10am appointment. app said 23 minutes and eta 10:10‚Ä¶that math is off. had me go to a train station, then to a different one.  ended up taking a full hour, missing an important appointment, and next appointment isn‚Äôt until 6 months from now. uninstalling now. | Where do I start ? First off my greeting when I first walked in was amazing. I checked in and sat down i didn‚Äôt wait 5mins to be called back. Ms.Pat greeted me in (oh and she pronounced my name correct first time) I don‚Äôt get that a lot. But she was sweet and loving we even conversed. Ms.Pat and Dr.D took very good care of me. Ms.Pat stayed with me the whole process and I appreciate her for that. How can you adore someone in such little timing. I hope you guys see this and to Dr.D and my new Dental mom Ms.Pat thank you so much ü©∑ | Not accurate | Crappy updates. Do not like the interface that has changed such as the lower left search area that also shows information about things to do, what it looks all worthless information. Wish you progamers fix a problem without attempting to enhance the program with a lot of crummy information. I use google maps to get from point A to B and etc. adding that worthless left lower  search with things to see do eat distraction. How can I hide that or go back to the old google maps ? Lousy update period. | She was extremely helpful when I asked for directions to cancel my parking reservation.  Such a nice lady. | Multi stop still doesn‚Äôt work properly after many months of updates. The stop doesn‚Äôt get removed after you‚Äôve arrived. It needs to be manually removed. Makes no sense after years of using this feature. | Muy buena aap | Why doesn‚Äôt this app give you options anymore. Why is there always only one route displayed? Suppose it‚Äôs a way I don‚Äôt want to take? How‚Äôs does google decide what way is better for me!?!? | This recent update just made everything confusing & harder to actually work maps. Just extra pressing & finding your way. Before it‚Äôll be your location and enter your destination then it just pops up. Now it‚Äôs just extra hitting go for it to show nyc trains when you‚Äôre literally walking or driving. Annoying | Same problem. I am so much smarter than this app. Won‚Äôt ask for its help again unless I am completely desperate. | Every time you clink a link to ab address you have to type the address again.   Apps sks | Aaa | Have gone on multiple 3 hour tips and I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I check the navigation after a while and it‚Äôs gone so I have to put in again while on the road. | The hamburger icon that allows you to edit the stops on your route is broken. Very frustrating. | Every time I try to use it, it just says unable to read the area look in settings try again | Helps find the place I need to go | Often times there is no audio just written directions which makes the trip difficult when driving solo or in the dark\nI spent many a time wandering aimlessly because of this | Hello. Could you please add icon non-accessible at the top? Where are train, person and car icons. Thank you | There is no navigation turn by turn in Iraq | Great service every time I come , Good guys ! | Will randomly say ‚Äúkeep left‚Äù when it means ‚Äúkeep right‚Äù or ‚Äúmake a right‚Äù when it means ‚Äúmake a left‚Äù. A navigation app having these issues in 2024 is unacceptable. \n\nApple Maps and Waze do not have this issue.\n\nAlso it will sometimes change your selected route mid trip to avoid traffic or for some random reason - it may end up screwing up your travel plan so be aware. | We were going to Universal Studios Hollywood from Disneyland and we were using Google Maps. We ended up driving around like a fool in LA | This new menu they added makes it impossible to save information on places you visit. Unnecessary extra steps to make down your notes and the data gets erased if you tap out. Ugh | This Company Gets 5 Stars From My Family And I . They‚Äôre There Right Away When I Make My Call . They Get My Family And I To School & Work Safely . We Greatly Appreciate You All #42 V | Was very helpful and polite. I would use this store again. His name is Tony. | Google maps has really lost it recently. The directions constantly send us into roundabout ways where we end up sitting in traffic. Routes change without warning after setting a specific route. The new interface is also horrible.

Gracias por el apoyo a la gesti√≥n que realiz√≥. | Dear Readdle Team, First, I want to say thank you for this awesome app. Second, before the latest update, I could rename files easily by sliding them to left and clicking on the renaming button. However, after the latest update, this feature is gone and only the delete button is available, also the process for renaming becomes somewhat time consuming. Please look into this and bring back that feature. Thanks üôèüèª\n\nUPDATE: Thank you so much for bringing this option back; I really appreciate it. üå∏ | This app is amazing I have everything I need, I read book, study ,watch movies and literally everything! But it needs more options for drawing and writing with pencil .think it would he nice if you add more pen options like pencil writing and dot writing.\nAlso it would be great if you add more page layout and design.\nThank you so much | So far so good | I personally think this app is the best app to handle your files, my sons uses this to download Minecraft mods and it always goes well! | The simplicity of way I‚Äôm able to use the application fresh from initial install is honestly everything to me. Thank you so much to the entire team at Readdle!! \nBrava! Superb work and I sincerely appreciate everyones collective motivation, tenacity, + vision ~ stay inspired y‚Äôall!!!\nüëåüèæüíØ‚ú®üíØüëåüèæ\n\nCheers, \nBobbyBearz‚Ñ¢Ô∏è | I chose this app as it was recommended by someone on YouTube for transferring music from my iPhone to a USB. Once I opened the app it didn‚Äôt look anything like the one on the video, I could not locate my music library as I was told I would be able to and was unable to find or move any music. Very disappointing. | Make an light mode please! | Good | This is a great program. It does everything I need it to do. | It just freezes and I can‚Äôt pay my bills now. Please fix! | Please try and add forgetting password to the app. My Face ID stop working since then I can‚Äôt even login to my account anymore. | Too confusing and you cant actually edit. | I don‚Äôt like to write reviews unless I‚Äôm blacked out, but this app is good like really good! It does a lot and I don‚Äôt read instructions because I download an app and then forget and wonder why I have 600 apps why isn‚Äôt there one to filter all the apps but I think documents may be able to do that. I certainly like to be able to use the video editor and not have problems with it, but I think it‚Äôs a problem with Safari and general and I handle problems with safari. I send a crash report after I make it crash and I know I‚Äôm not gonna tell you, yes it‚Äôs easy. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not going to tell anyone. Right now I‚Äôm watching it the video and it brought it up on the Internet or web browser and then after I hear all the squawking then you‚Äôve got mail, I open documents on days I don‚Äôt forget about it like not very often. It‚Äôs open right now. I‚Äôm trying to close it. I just can‚Äôt though because I‚Äôve psychological issues. It‚Äôs not mine psychology either, but I am gonna have to go to one of the more fun apps and heavy apps so that I can really really crank some of this grit out of the video. Oh my God it‚Äôs old less than DVD so less than 480 up at 7:20 because I‚Äôm stupid when it comes to, go on a date. Sorry I had to stop myself from saying a name that‚Äôs not allowed and I‚Äôm not going to proofread or edit. Hopefully dictation is still on because my eyes have been shut your eyes. I like the features I like that I have mine free as a gift of course | the icon is everywhere and i dont know how to get rid of it before it wasnt there and now its everywhere be carefull if you install this virus thing thnks | After reaching to you and discussing a function was in the app and in this version it‚Äôs live and it‚Äôs here.. the BEST FILES APP.. THE BEST DEVS. | A really good app on iphone but please add an option for inserting a downloaded subtitle on video | I can edit .json again!!!!!!!!!!! | #1 Interface Design - Those with limited vision AVOID! If you can have the iPad‚Äôs screen viewed on a large screen TV that is your only solution.\n#2 Icon IDs - the fellow Ukrainian company Affinity has labels appear if you hold down on an icon to identify its use, not here.\n#3 Poor File Manager versus Apple‚Äôs FILES app!!!\n#4 Does NOT WORK with attached drives via the iPad‚Äôs USB-C connector. BIG ERROR! I have a 4TB SSD drive attached at this moment to this iPad Pro and it‚Äôs NOT SEEN by this app, YET FILES from Apple can access the SSD. And has for Years, great foresight Apple!\n‚Äî\nITS VALUE - ARE WHAT I CALL THE ‚ÄòAdd-On‚Äù functions making the app a Limited Value app. | Loved the app for music downloads but lately I‚Äôve had an issue with certain sounds skipping during playback. Anyone else have this issue? Has the issue with skipping been fixed?\n\nI've already send you the information and it still seems like it's not been fixed. | Freddy‚ù§Ô∏è | Ukraine <3 | I don‚Äôt want your VPN and I won‚Äôt upgrade. The callouts are obnoxious. | I just updated the app and now all the downloaded videos I have on there won‚Äôt play anymore. It was perfectly fine until I updated the d*mn app. | TRASH | Amazing | Please add video speed settings manually | Pls I don‚Äôt wanna scroll for my music lol ty | So perfect üíï | Heating issues Please Fix this problem | Recommended.. | I love this app but unfortunately it does not support Persian language. Persian is one of the beautiful and ancient languages of the world that is spoken by more than 110 million people in Western and Central Asia. Please add this language to your app so I can use it better. Thank you. | Very helpful | Thank you so much. I appreciate the creator of this app. I wish you peace and happiness. Thanks for Ukraine, Dear. | Ive been using this app for a few years now to house all of my music and it‚Äôs been good to me, but here recently since the last few updates my songs are all skipping at 1:30 for some reason. I‚Äôve tried my earbuds, cars aux, and through my phones speaker to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a short in any of the wiring but they skip regardless of what I play them on. I unfortunately can‚Äôt delete the app and redownload it because I‚Äôll lose all of my files. Are they any suggestions or are there any upcoming updates that could potentially resolve this issue? | Unfortunately this update version, is not working properly on iphone 15 promax and it has bugs to be fixed. It request to shut down the mobile inorder to work properly! | Overall it‚Äôs good quite better than our popular VLC ‚Ä¶just the video buffers from time to time I don‚Äôt know why‚Ä¶ | You've already been paid for this app. And now you inject ads for upgrades and other apps inside my paid app?\n\nNot only will this guarantee that I never purchase anything advertised, this is also a great way to lose me as a customer for life.\n\nYou cannot be trusted. | With recent updates, every single time I use the thumbnail page view, an advertisement for subscription services pops up. I have been using this app for about seven years now. It has always been my preferred app for my PDF library that is about 40GB in size, completely offline and stored on my iPad. I do not need or want any online services. This popup ad is very aggravating and makes navigating large PDF documents annoying. | The iTunes Folder app used to show up in the files app as Documents (no, not the sidebar). I used to copy files to that folder in Files app because, unlike moving files to the Documents app listed on the sidebar, moving it to that folder in the files app‚Äôs main screen preserved the creation dates. \n\nI deleted the app and then redownloaded, but the folder seems to be gone now. Why? What happened??\n\nI‚Äôd rather not copy it to Files through the sidebar section of the app. I want to preserve creation dates. | greetings from the grand canyon state, USA! hope y‚Äôall are safe. \ni‚Äôve been using the documents app for a long time and watched features come and go. some great - some i won‚Äôt miss at all. but two things remain the same: quality & functionality. i can rely on readlle. every time, and documents suits most of my needs. \none feature that was recently removed is the ‚Äúswipe to rename‚Äù. sure, i can still use the ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù and then select ‚Äúrename‚Äù, but, when you have 3-400 files that all need a slight adjustment to the file name, even just one or two added steps make the process take much, much longer. \nthe ‚Äúswipe‚Äù feature cut the time by quite a bit, and is missed. \na feature i would like to see is the ability to create a video playlist, and/or, randomized playback for video files.\nthank you developers. and keep up the good work! from Tucson, Arizona! | when am play song they stop again and again i hope u fix this | Nice | This app was amazing for years. Sadly over the past year it gets less and less stable with each update causing more freezing and full on app crashes. Tried all kinds of fixes and sadly it seems I‚Äôll have to move on to another app to get a stable experience. | Lithuania‚Äôs the best app for important things ever!

I pay for T-Mobile with my family and get Netflix so why the heck can‚Äôt I get on the account with this stupid ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù thing. Stop money grabbing you‚Äôve literally made billions and get over yourselves. | PLEASE PETITION FOR NETFLIX TO REMOVE RIVERDALE AND ADD JUJUTSU KAISEN BACK üôèüôèüôè | I think the new rule that you have to be in the house that has the account it stupid. Even when you get the code it‚Äôs only for 14 days! That‚Äôs ridiculous. If that family lets you be on the account it shouldn‚Äôt matter if we aren‚Äôt in the same household when we have the permission! | Me and my family have been sharing the same Netflix account for over 10 years. Now because my immediate family members live in different households, we can no longer all use the same account. | All I want to do is watch ninjago and I can‚Äôt | What a joke. Happily uninstalled forevermore | Household policy has made living in two houses extremely frustrsting | Netflix updated so now I have to be on one specific internet or it doesn‚Äôt let me watch. It was bad enough I couldn‚Äôt cast to the tv at my boyfriends house but now I can‚Äôt watch Netflix there period. This update was what made me decide to cancel my account and delete the app. It‚Äôs sad cuz there‚Äôs a lot I liked on Netflix, but they‚Äôre so obsessed with stopping people from sharing accounts that I can‚Äôt use my own account anymore. This is a huge disappointment, I will not go back unless a change is made. | If I‚Äôm paying $15 to be able to use multiple screens, I should be able to use multiple screens anywhere anytime. This is a horrible move of Netflix‚Äôs part. Will probably delete soon. | Now you can‚Äôt use your Netflix account if it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot part of the household‚Äù Not worth it and I will be canceling my membership | I can‚Äôt believe after 10 years of having my own account with my dad who has a 4 people plan‚Ä¶I have been removed because of the house policy‚Ä¶my dad moved to another family and I can‚Äôt keep my Netflix account‚Ä¶.?Do better Netflix and take that Household Policy off. | Netflix is a horrible website to watch anything on, why would i overpay for them to remove shows i watch?? | I was just sitting there watching Netflix and in the middle of my show they removed it without a warning BTW I was watching The legend of Korra | hello! Watching Netflix is the best. Even thought there are inappropriate content, there‚Äôs tv shows/movies that I have NEVER seen before. Also tv shows/movies that you could learn from. However don‚Äôt rely on what happens in movies or tv shows, it‚Äôs all fake unless of course you are watching a documentary or nature tv shows/moviesüòÖ. But I do wish that they had more options for the profile picture, like maybe design it yourself or something. In the end, thank YOU Netflix for making it happen ‚ù§Ô∏è. Have a wonderful day everyone üôèüèΩ | It‚Äôs been 2 days since I renewed my subscription, and I am still getting a notice in the Netflix app to ‚ÄúAdd Payment!‚Äù  I have been a Netflix subscriber for over 15 years, and this has never happened before!  Honestly, Netflix isn‚Äôt worth the price anymore, anyways, so I‚Äôll take this screwup as my cue to leave this service.  Charging a minimum of $15.49 per month for Netflix is outrageous!  There a so many other quality streaming services that are free or charging much less than Netflix.  Netflix, you‚Äôre not the only option anymore! | Hi i love netflix | Ever since the household update, I can‚Äôt watch on my phone without requesting permission from an email I don‚Äôt hold. I can‚Äôt go on vacation and watch Netflix. There is almost no point in subscribing anymore. The shows that were worthwhile are being taken off due to lack of people watching, however it begins to not be the fault of people once Netflix locks down where/who can watch on an account. | Literally awful. I wish I had never downloaded this app. Absolutely the worst. | I like Netflix but you guys keep deleting my fav shows and movies!\nLike please just stop deleting things from your app. It kinda annoying.\n\nNo offense but that‚Äôs stupid! | Commercial in the movies and stop looking at time | this was the only platform I loved because it had no ads so I can enjoy my movie or show there‚Äôs like 8 ads on one movie just yesterday had no ads now today I open it to see it has ads it ruined the app probably cancel the membership \nEdit: and I also see movies I‚Äôve watched and shows are locked and now I have to pay more money to unlock it this is miserable this is Hulu now I‚Äôm so disappointed. | at first the household policy was annoying simply because i couldn‚Äôt use netflix on my tv while being away at school. now that it has been some months, with more updates since then, i can‚Äôt even access my account on my phone or laptop without being kicked off or being told to make a new account. absolutely ridiculous. there‚Äôs no reason i shouldn‚Äôt be able to access something that i essentially pay for. | Unfortunately Netflix wasn't happy being the largest, most successful streaming platform and decided to stop allowing FAMILIES to share an account. And no, Netflix, asking my parents and I to pay additional money a month to do what we've been doing for the last 4 years does not count as a solution. Unless you're a single loser with no family or close friends, I can't recommend Netflix over literally any of the other streaming services (Max, Hulu, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, Apple TV, etc.), because they at least understand sharing accounts is the only reason anyone even buys accounts in the first place. I sure hope you've grown that bottom line there Netflix, because I know at least one family that won't be giving you their money anymore. | Needs to be a master user level feature where the content can be set to only show content which has audio in a specific language or languages. I dont enjoy dubbed movies and only occasionally can be bothered to use subtitles due to my presbyopia. Selecting the displaed content by language would enable me to review suggestions that i would have. Hope of watching rather thn doom scrolling through ‚Äúinternational‚Äù content added to pad the inventory. | I pay for the max amount of devices on Netflix and they have now decided that people they deem are outside of my household cant log in. To Netflix your household is defined as people within your home. I have kids that went away to college that are still very much a part of my household and they can no longer access our family‚Äôs account. If I pay for devices I should get to decide what devices those are.  What if I , the person paying for Netflix wants to watch outside of my home and happen to be on another WiFi?  II think I‚Äôm going to end my subscription especially if my kids in college aren‚Äôt a part of my household anymore. | Terrible privacy settings. Garbage app. | netflix is getting out of hand. now you HAVE to watch nexflix with wifi no matter if you‚Äôre home or not. NOT EVERYONE WATCHES NETFLIX FROM HOME. the first update was idiotic to begin with. not everyone can afford ALMOST $20 for a streaming service with a few good shows or movies. the newest update doesn‚Äôt let you watch netflix without being on wifi or give you a vacation code. what if someone doesn‚Äôt have wifi, what if the wifi is out? stuff like that does happen. netflix is unprepared and just trying to squeeze money from already struggling people who just want entertainment. GREEDY, AND MONEY HUNGRY people who already have money and can live comfortably not having to worry about paying almost $20 | Guys it‚Äôs not worth buying a subscription anymore, stop supporting garbage Netflix decisions. | Absolutely ridiculous that I need to buy my own account just because I‚Äôm away for college. I am still a part of my family‚Äôs household and live at home for majority of the year, so why can‚Äôt I watch on my family‚Äôs account that they pay for?Makes absolutely no sense. Ridiculous money grab. You will NOT catch me spending more money to watch the poor selection of shows available. | When I first got it it was amaze . There where so many things to watch. ( I recommend a series of unfortunate events and family reunion) but it only lets u watch if you have 4 bars or over . | My sister, my mom, my grandma, and I are all a part of the same household and use the same family Netflix subscription. However, since my sister and I are in college for part of the year and away from home, we can no longer access our account. Netflix needs to consider different family situations. I get that they‚Äôre trying to make more money and prevent password sharing, but we are still very much dependents and part of the same household, so this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.\n\nA lot of the time, I watch at night when my classes/work is over, but my mom doesn‚Äôt stay up late. I‚Äôm not going to wake my mother up every time I plan to unwind with a show. The family account is made for families, and not every family looks the same. According to Netflix though, they all should. I wish Netflix wouldn‚Äôt punish the loyal users it already has in a quest for profit, and instead consider a greater diversity of human experiences and family dynamics. | Pretty lame move Netflix | Just like says. Raising prices without raising the quality of the content. What good they have is likely canceled without a final ep it season. Tired of streaming. | This is a awesome app GO DOWNLOAD NOW | The household update is terrible I deleted the app it makes no sense we can have multiple accounts on the app but can‚Äôt use it at a different location I won‚Äôt use Netflix again until that is gone! | At this point I‚Äôm canceling my subscription, I pay for Netflix for me , Now when I travel I can‚Äôt sign in to other tvs ???? And if I try to air play it , it won‚Äôt let me ?? \nMy Hulu app , Amazon prime , and HBO aren‚Äôt like this‚Ä¶.I have stuck with Netflix through all the price changes and policy changes but as a long time customer I‚Äôm very disappointed and won‚Äôt continue my subscription when it‚Äôs up this time. They have gone to far. | As a college student, netflix is the worst option. No deals, no student discount. Hulu and Spotify together I pay $5 for. Netflix does not have good enough options to do this. | If you‚Äôre someone like me who has some downtime at work and enjoys watching a tv show while enjoying lunch or a break then let me tell you, Netflix is not for you. They recently joined the money hungry corporate mindset and only allow a set number of devices on your ‚Äúhousehold wifi‚Äù to access the account. In order to get around this Netflix has an option where you can get an email sent to your account email which allows a set number of days for streaming per device. Hopefully you don‚Äôt have a cellphone, iPad, laptop, work computer, etc. that you sometimes swap between to enjoy your shows. \nWith the price increases over the years and the lack of care towards their consumers, they really aren‚Äôt one of the top streaming platforms anymore. Sad. | Lately, it seems every single show you watch on here finds a way to take the Lord‚Äôs name in vain in ways that don‚Äôt even make sense with the writing itself. Clearly Netflix is fine with crappy shows, and movies nobody likes. | fix the household thing i don‚Äôt live with my dad and we don‚Äôt know how to fix it | Yeah it‚Äôs great that I‚Äôm in college and can‚Äôt get on Netflix anymore. | This app should be 4 and up since it's just shows according to your age anyways. | I‚Äôm a kid and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing here ü§ìü§ì | In their attempt to stop people from stealing passwords, they consistently restrict access for people that legitimately use their service. \n\nFor instance, my mother, the one who pays for our account, is on a cruise without internet access. I attempt to watch the same shows I have been watching at work for weeks, yet when attempting the same thing today, I am magically restricted from viewing unless my mother responds to a text or email from them. \n\nAbsolutely horrific experience with this app and this streaming service. Don‚Äôt waste your money. If you pay for it, you won‚Äôt even be able to use it when you want to. | Really don‚Äôt enjoy the structure of the app. Between big blocks that take up my whole phone screen showing just one show/movie forcing you to scroll endlessly to find something you like, the weird tabs at the top that don‚Äôt even bring me to my recently watched, is just a mess. I enjoy Netflix, but the mobile app is a big turn off. I don‚Äôt know why it had to be turned into a app where all you do is scroll‚Ä¶. The big blocks for one show/movie is not necessary and severally hinders the experience, and makes me not want to even open the app. | Very nice, I wish to add some Arabic works and movies, Egyptian comedy series. | Awful household policies. As someone who travels often Netflix is such an absolute nightmare. There is either a high level of ignorance or greed taking place at Netflix hq. Awful company. Awful business practices. | I have two homes and multiple family members.

They have a good product then they update it and make it worse. The recent update is awful. Maybe it allows for greater data mining. It certainly doesn‚Äôt help the user experience.

I hope it gets fixed soon, will update review once it does. | Once a great, simple search app is now a crummy, bloated, bug-ridden web browser. I don‚Äôt get it.

The majority of their products are of extremely low quality and often come with misleading advertisements. Navigating through their app and website is a challenging task due to its complexity. Whenever seeking assistance, you receive repetitive responses to various rephrased questions from customer service agents who seem to be trained to repeat only a few sentences. Consequently, you are left with no choice but to file a chargeback, which leads to the freezing of your orders.

You need to be able to change your name. I had a joke name and people thought it was a fake account. I even paid for gold level for 1 month. That account got no views or activity and was deleted. 2. I write in the bio section FWB and get banned. I appeal and win. The reset of my account caused the lag in activity, in my opinion.\n\nAlso, it‚Äôs funny that you get a bunch of likes before you give them money. | Tbh I wish I just didn‚Äôt download app at all | Not worth the money.. straight up | A couple months ago, I was banned out of nowhere. I tried to appeal it but never heard back from Tinder Support. I was a victim of revenge reporting/hate crime. | We can go in the morning and | I‚Äôve been paying $16.99 for tinder gold for the ability to hit that little rewind button and revisit a profile I accidentally swiped on. But for the last few weeks that button hasn‚Äôt worked no matter how many times I press it or how many updates you crank out. What gives??? Cuz at this point you‚Äôre basically stealing my money | Demasiados perfiles falsos se tiene que verificar el origen | Spent too much money on this app and too much time with absolutely no results. Not a match not a conversation, solely bot matching and automatic un matching, hearing so many success stories my only assumption is tinder hates me. | This is literally the most corrupt company on the App Store. Look at the BBB reviews and look on Google about how unethical and corrupt this company is. The Match Group owns Tinder and Hinge. They have a monopoly in the online dating world and it‚Äôs just so extremely unethical. \n\nThey will permanently ban you AFTER you pay for the upgrade.\n\nAnd they have to keep charging such extremely high amounts for their their subscription, because they keep losing subscribers. However, the reason they keep losing subscribers is because of their unethical permanent banning system. And they continue to lie to the investors and they say they are losing subscribers because of inflation, but it is absolutely because of their unethical banning system. | \"Your phone carrier is not supported.\"\n\ncant even use the app | tinder super app üòçü§© | I honestly hated tinder definitely was a hinge girl but didn‚Äôt have hope for either of them just had them for fun. Ended up meeting my boyfriend who is the most amazing guy in the world | Tinder has been gutted. What once was a very likable, social app, where you could potentially meet someone outside of a bar setting and at your own pace has become like most AAA games; pay to play. Pretty sure ‚Äòlikes‚Äô don‚Äôt even make it to anyone unless you pay for a sub, ‚Äòsuper likes‚Äô which once were free are def something you have to pay for now. Whereas I used to get multiple matches a week, now has been a desert for months (see aforementioned ‚Äòlikes‚Äô don‚Äôt count for free). Seems even capitalism has hit the romance/emotional happiness realm in this cesspool country, and having a ‚Äúfree‚Äù app just to meet like-minded people is too much to ask for. The only positive aspect I can give is that the number of spam accounts seems to have gone down (though having facial confirmation as a given upon signing up would greatly reduce that, than as an afterthought) but it doesn‚Äôt matter, because again if you aren‚Äôt shelling out money for a sub, your profile gets buried and might as well be inactive‚Ä¶which is what I am doing to mine right after this submission! Thanks for stooping to the bottom Tinder and selling out what once was a decent app. | This app is a waste of time bunch of fake accounts and men pretending to be women don‚Äôt waste ya time find another alternative oh and you‚Äôll also be randomly banned | App is dead, don‚Äôt waste your time | My tinder doesn‚Äôt match with people. It says I have likes but nobody is matching. Also when I swipe the same people I swiped left on still coming up and when I restart my account it does the exact same thing. Y‚Äôall need to fix this | There is not real ppl here anymore only AI computers replying to your texts | So overall I like the app but I just recently had a situation where a girl claimed to be 18 on here and ultimately met with her but luckily I stuck with my gut and when I met her I asked if she could prove she was 18 from her profile. She was hesitant (mind you I‚Äôm 21 I‚Äôm not catching a case) so then I asked for her phone number and found her instagram and her Facebook and she was 17‚Ä¶ Tinder do better bro, I could‚Äôve been in serious trouble if I would‚Äôve hooked up with her like the original plan was. Plus there are just way to many bots on this app as well. That is all :) | Skanks and fake profiles.  Strange how every 9 has a male first name and everyone else you would want to be seen out with. This is for anyone to use after 2am when you strike out every where else. | All abt money | Feels like you have to buy in to even get close to a match then once you do they try to get another $50 out of you to boost your profile so you even show up | So many ads within 5 minutes | I see the same people over and over. I swipe right on every single one‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think this app works. Total scam. | I have been on this app for 7+ years and all because I was going through a lot of depression and was down bad, it didn‚Äôt help much, almost made me feel worse at times, I‚Äôve only gotten with few women but most of them are all the same dry women that doesn‚Äôt talk or plays games, had 10 more likes without matches because I always get the ones that didn‚Äôt like back, and now after awhile of never using tinder I get banned for being accused of advertising to be a sugar dad when almost everyone in tinder does that 24/7 except me, or it‚Äôs because of my selfies of me wearing my tank tops, this app is ridiculous and is waste of time | At the beginning I had ‚Äúlikes‚Äù but to see the likes I had to pay. Well, I paid one week to see how it goes. Once I paid, no more likes, no more messages. The app just ask you for more money. After 2 weeks I canceled my subscription. Guess what! People stated sending messages and likes but I had to pay to see the likes. Don‚Äôt fall in the scam, these apps are made for that. Do you want to meet people? Go to bars, parks, gyms, etc. | It‚Äôs your new dating app , good luck ! | If you just swipe on everyone it shows you how many bots are on the app farming interactions and leading users to scam sites, advertising catfish nsfw content. The tinder devs do not care they just want a large userbase. They know how many bots are on the app and there‚Äôs no option to report it. This being a dating app makes it even more evil, just go outside | Have to pay for bots and delusional people is insane | I switched to hinge, where my photos don‚Äôt get weirdly compressed and destroyed every time I upload them. If photos aren‚Äôt in the perfect aspect ratio, tinder makes them look blurry and bad. Genuinely made me stop using the app cause I don‚Äôt have all day to adjust my photos until they‚Äôre not blurry. | ‚ò†Ô∏è | Now you can't even see who you already liked, and there's another special swipe option for $$$. Ugh | How do you delete tinder l? I want it off of my phone! | All this app is is a tool used for women to meet men to have sex for cash. I wonder what you call that? Hmmmm. I should also be able to use my username in my bio btw. Don't hide the name on your awful sex pedaling app. | This app need a major overhaul! I don‚Äôt know what happened to this app but it was great in the beginning but now it‚Äôs horrible it‚Äôs filled with bots and scammers and people who just want to promote there only fans or snaps! There‚Äôs also people who have multiple accounts! There‚Äôs multiple fake accounts and bots and even if there real their scammers and the developers don‚Äôt seem to care, they just seemed to give up on this app! Also messages still have problems! Also prices are way to high!\nAlso this app is a scam | I believe my account got banned in error long time ago before the appeal action center was a thing, I had no idea why and how my account got banned and only to find out I now have no access to appeal action either because the ban was taken prior to the launch of the Appeal Center. ‚ÄúOnly actions taken after you received access to the Appeal Center can be appealed through it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make any sense, I believe I got banned in error but cannot appeal simply because it was banned a long time ago? This is unfair and disappointing. | I've lost 30 minutes and there is no one girl who wants to chat with me, tell me how to be more attractive? | Tinder has had me banned forever and this happened at least three or four years ago. I was banned with absolutely no emailed reason and verification with what I had done (I doubt it, I like to keep it clean), I at least could have received a proper and professional courtesy, especially considering \nI had spent some money which ofc I could not receive a refund for despite not being told why I was banned without any sort of actual appeal process. So, short version, Tinder is pretty much a scam so never pay for anything here, if some random person reports you (some people do that if they don‚Äôt like a person, it shouldn‚Äôt be someone‚Äôs immediate reaction to report people if one or two reports gets someone banned with little to no appeal at all and the ban will last years and years. \n\nDon‚Äôt pay for anything on this app. You may end up kicked off for no reason and won‚Äôt be able to get your money. If you‚Äôre having trouble with Tinder. Switch to something else. There‚Äôs a lot better for free. | Hi, I just downloaded the app yesterday and I can't see any likes and have to relike people. Please fix this asap. I haven't had this problem in the past.

My body is paying the price for their big mouths! | Threads seems to have too many bot accounts. | Really had high hopes for this app, and for a few weeks people seemed so happy to be on it.   Social\nMedia campaigns from big companies were fresh, clever, and didn‚Äôt sound corporate.    People liked each others‚Äô personal posts.    But it just didn‚Äôt keep it up‚Ä¶really, it never created any real social interaction.   Celebrities and political posts get all the views,  Just. Like. Twitter.   Our small company gets a lot of real engagement on Twitter (yes a fraction of total engagement) and on Instagram, but nothing on Threads despite a successful Instagram migration.     ie the same audience-on IG they engage, on Threads they don‚Äôt.   Some stopped.   It‚Äôs a waste of time unless you want to follow the Kardashians and the moronic Trump Biden hate fest. | It‚Äôs full of 5cent internet prostitues | Follow - MONOPOLY ACE | Êï∞ÊçÆÁºìÂ≠òË∂äÊù•Ë∂äÂ§öÔºåÈô§‰∫ÜÂç∏ËΩΩ‰πãÂ§ñÊ≤°ÊúâÂà´ÁöÑÊ∏ÖÈô§ÁºìÂ≠òÁöÑÂäûÊ≥ï | What‚Äôs not to love | I cannot see comments unless I delete and then re-download the app. It started happening about 3 weeks ago. ? | See above | It‚Äôs showing me ads / bots accts / suggested stuff. Not stuff I want to see and follow | Funny | Starting to get a little boring | This is way better than Twitter AKA X | Hoping threads continues to be open minded and supportive to so many wonderfully creative content providers. They deserve all the support they can get to succeed in their careers. Thank you! | This app is much better than Twitter ever since that billionaire narcissist with a fragile ego took over | Honestly, I don‚Äôt really have much to say it‚Äôs just this app is the equivalent to hot duty booty water Garbo on fire I don‚Äôt even know why they made this. This is actually hot Dookie butter.if I could I would give it a 0 but that‚Äôs not possible so I give it a 1 | No X-rated content so it‚Äôs better than Twitter. | Why do we need another social media app? No one even interacts with me so probably deleting soon | 1. Shows it has one notification for no reason\n2. Nonsense recommended contents\n3. No\nNo | Until you have a normal new user account login without instaCrap I'll be on X. | Howdy | I won't download this garbage, no matter how much you try to advertise it on instagram. It‚Äôs actively making me NOT want it. | Love getting the news via Threads, that‚Äôs my primary use! And I like reading the comments to see what different people‚Äôs opinions are. Sending memes to friends is just a huge cherry on top while using Threads :) | The Threads app is moderated much more appropriately than other apps, like Twitter, where explicit racism, hate and bigotry are pervasive. | Empowering others üíï | I enjoy political content and now that it is essentially banned it is not as engaging.  Spending more time back on TikTok | The nice thing is the developers are currently listening to customers on what features we want to see in the app. | I get my news here. | Really enjoyed when I first joined a few months ago it seems that the algorithm started changing. I have to actually look up ppl that I follow or they follow me. Constantly blocking & reporting porn (maybe bots) myself I‚Äôve blocked at least a 100 if not more. Something needs to be done. It‚Äôs not fair to dedicated users. Plz don‚Äôt let this turn into Elons Xhitter Plz | With the migration of more accounts to Threads it IS becoming the platform promised. A Kinder Gentler medium for sharing, and exchanging ideas.\nTime Will Tell Less ‚ÄúAlgorithms‚Äù ‚ÄúSteering ‚Äú conversations‚Ä¶ | Threads is honestly the least interactive app I‚Äôve been on so far, but I laugh a lot on here so I guess it‚Äôs kind of cool‚Ä¶.. | Threads is becoming the closest thing to a Hobby I play with daily‚Ä¶ | In the beginning I had my doubts. But if you COMBINE BOTH THREADS üßµ and INSTAGRAM you will soon forget Twitter ever existed. I have üòè | Best way to communicate and network with similar peopleü•∞ | Keep up the hard work, doing well!!! | Compared to X, formally known as Twitter, Threads presents a unique way to discover things you enjoy in a unique light. | I wish I could understand the difference between this and Instagram. I know they are a little different, but not that much. | Bette than IG itself | The chosen sun is here lolololol | I don‚Äôt know why I follow accounts. I rarely see them in my feed. I do see lots of things I have no interest in. | Really love this app, I feel like it is curated just for me. A few bugs but we‚Äôll get there! | The app is a pleasure to be in vs Twitter the debates I get into are more ethical and respectful \n\nIt makes me feel sane vs what ELON creates | He‚Äôs mean and Annoying | Easy to follow and to post photos and statements. | Wellness ideas for take more fallower in instagrams & thankfully for best social media instagram and love you for ever ‚Ä¶. Support me and share me pls ‚Ä¶ i know instagram have smarter artificial intelligence ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π | I am using this app for about 6 month now , and I have about 2200 followers , it has been working fine , but since the last update my main account doesn't work properly, to be exact I can see other peoples comments on my posts in the heart section below , but when I tap on them to answer it gives an error , I hope you understand the value of my time which I spent it all on your stupid app , now I need you to fix this as soon as you can you can üò°üò°üò° | Honestly I really like the app and would love to use it. Unfortunately, every time I try to make an account I end up getting restricted and I‚Äôm unable to follow people. Seems like they have an overzealous ai bot filter that likes to flag normal people for behaviors like, following more than five accounts. Hope they decide to try something else real soon. I‚Äôd sure like to be able to use the app for its intended purpose | I really really like what they were going for with this app, especially with other social media apps like this making poor decisions, but my one issue is that it has to be a part of Instagram, and not this awkward seperation. Having Threads is amazing and all, but none of my friends use it, probably due to this awkward access ordeal. They see the posts on instagram and think \"Oh! this looks cool!\" but then being told to download a whole other app really smothers that thought out immediately. Having it as part of how reels is, where its at the bottom tabs of instagram would be PERFECT. And im sure if that happened, everyone would use it. | I love this app, because it allows me to connect to so many new individuals, it also allows me to be free and not feel like others are judging me.  Being able to connect with so many new individuals and not just videos is amazing.   Only bad thing is with notifications unless ur logged into the app u don‚Äôt see when someone replies to u.   I would love to be able to get a notification for that on my phone so I quit missing replies.   \nTalking on here is amazing. | the threads algorithm censors many things. it‚Äôs extremely annoying. we are supposed to have freedom of speech esp on internet platforms. now these platforms are the long arm of government propaganda. give us back our freedom","currentVersionScore":4.3638,"currentVersionReviews":569,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8e/93/e4/8e93e4ea-e460-b503-145c-66cd106b4ecd/752f57e3-8a0b-4345-88ad-a0047a922262_iOS_SMALL_2.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/50/dc/76/50dc760c-dfaf-cee6-4b50-25a3f5f0a87b/370c2fe4-1bd8-4ba9-81a3-e9b8efbd5e18_iOS_SMALL_3.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/20/7a/48/207a482e-1134-bd19-3078-d1e372c88c34/6fb65a46-78c3-4756-8f94-4052167e957a_iOS_SMALL_4.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/59/63/2e/59632e34-6107-c732-e6a2-c010807117b2/8844d240-7b00-4ab2-b808-e2ce73b77f17_iOS_SMALL_5.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini","iPhone12-iPhone12","iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro","iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax","iPadAir4-iPadAir4","iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular","iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen","iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular","iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen","iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular","iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen","iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular","iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro","iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax","iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini","iPhone13-iPhone13","iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen","iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular","iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen","iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular","iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen","iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen","iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular","iPhone14-iPhone14","iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus","iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro","iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax","iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen","iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular","iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen","iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular","iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen","iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular","iPhone15-iPhone15","iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus","iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro","iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax"]}

There used to be way less ads and it was more fun. The amount of ads ruins the app. I used to be a frequent user but now rarely use it because all the adds ruins it. :( | I haven‚Äôt seen anyone save any of my pins in over a month.  Are my psges hidden.  I‚Äôve had pins removed & then restored.  I‚Äôve had pins removed & when I click on view pin within seven days I don‚Äôt see the pin that was deleted.  I‚Äôm left in the dark. | I love Pinterest, but I have suggestions: remove the pin/board/follow limits for all accounts OR just make the limits hourly/daily and have them reset every night at midnight or something; please add a feature in which users can delete messages WITHIN THE APPLICATION (‚Äúhiding the thread‚Äù only hides messages until a user receives another message from the same user who sent the first one; it only puts messages back in the inbox; it doesn‚Äôt actually delete any messages that have been sent or received); some of my pins don‚Äôt show up in the ‚ÄúAll Pins‚Äù section (this happens mostly with pins saved from sources other than Pinterest); the ‚ÄúPins‚Äù section for the ‚ÄúTune Feed‚Äù feature isn‚Äôt loading | Great app but, did you remove the home feed tuner? It won‚Äôt load. | For real, everything will find a way to break. Phantom notifications, comment sections disappearing or becoming inaccessible, getting emails that your pins have been flagged or taken down with no indication of which pin it even is. | It seems that with this current update we have to actually PIN what's being viewed before we can downloaded the image to the photo album on the phone. Two months ago I saved a lot of images to show my kitchen renovator some options. I didn't need to pin them, just look until a style was decided. I just wanted to use the image as a reference instead of filling my boards. Please bring back the DOWNLOAD IMAGE option! | this app is great but recently i cant type on any pins and there really needs to be better bullying restrictions | every other week im unable to see any comments and its rlly frustrating üò≠ pls do smthn ab thisüôèüôè | 4-5 ads after every pin - and not even ads that interest me. What is going on?! This is no longer an enjoyable app to use. | I love using the app but I have noticed that there are so many adds. I was just scrolling a few minutes ago and stopped to see how many adds were on my screen versus pins, 4 adds and 1 pin.  I really like using the app but there‚Äôs no reason to have it if all I‚Äôm going to see are advertisements. | My feed 3 days ago was great. Minimal ADs, pins I was actually interested in. And it had the top bit that allowed you to specifically see pin suggestions for recent boards. I don‚Äôt know what happened because today, nothing is geared to things I‚Äôm interested and every other regular potential pin is an AD. Time for another hiatus from this app. I want a version where I can pay a monthly fee and not have any ADs. This is an app to get inspiration. The ADs take away from that. | I have been trying to comment update and nothings working please help my account is @lilacrose976 | Excelente aplicaci√≥n, muy recomendable para obtener im√°genes de √≥ptima calidad | I absolutely LOVE this app, I am an artist and I use pinterest almost exclusively to find my references. The only problem I have is that this app doesn‚Äôt have the option to put more sections into the board sections. Currently, a user can create a board, and let‚Äôs say I want a board for photo references. I want a section for full body photos, but I want to separate sitting and standing, but I can‚Äôt put other sections into the full body photos section. I like to be organized, and I would really love a feature to fix this issue, and I think other users would agree. | BEST PICTURE APPPPP! | I‚Äôve been using Pinterest for well over 10 years, I have tens of thousands of pins. I am becoming increasingly frustrated with Pinterest‚Äôs policies as I am consistently receiving emails that my pins of moody artwork ‚Äúviolate community policies‚Äù. Pinterest has started censoring artwork and quotes so heavily that my account is being threatened to be banned for pinning images of women crying or sad or heartbroken. News flash, Pinterest- these are normal, human experiences being portrayed through art. I‚Äôm disgusted and disappointed that Pinterest has taken this approach. Apparently only happy and uplifting pins are allowed on Pinterest now, we are to all pretend that we are perfectly fine and no one struggles. If you are a person who enjoys moody artwork or the reality of the human experience, skip this site and stay far away. I‚Äôve now wasted over a decade and countless hours creating a collection of pins on a site where my account will likely be suspended or banned due to pinning an image of a girl crying on her bed after a breakup. This site used to be useful, not anymore. | new updates:\nbug fixes \nperformance improvements \n95% of content is now ads that have nothing to do with the viewer\nwhat's up with that?ü•≤ | Ok so Pinterest has helped so much during my life! Every time I want an idea for something I always look on Pinterest cuz it just has the cutest things > <\n             ^\n\nLuv it! Everything works great and it‚Äôs super easy to use! | What‚Äôs the point of even creating a pin when people can even comment on it at all?? Almost every pin I make NO ONE can‚Äôt comment on it and when I try to click allow comments it says ‚Äúcomments are unavailable for this pin‚Äù\nThis is stupid | I love the format and selections. My only issue of a downside is that the recipe jumps around while I‚Äôm trying to make it  sometime it goes all the way out in lieu of an advertisement. That‚Äôs annoying | The mobile experience is becoming unbearable. Ads feel like they‚Äôre becoming as numerous as pins. I truly feel that sometimes I‚Äôm just scrolling through ads. And the video ads make it even worse. The notification system is terrible. When someone likes a comment you‚Äôve posted. One would think you could click on the notification to go back to the original comment, but no, you cannot. And deleting posts because there is nudity, even if it‚Äôs a classical sculpture in a museum that anyone can see‚Ä¶too much. This and other UI features make this app intolerable. I have deleted the app, because the user experience brings more annoyance than enjoyment. | Pinterest is my favorite app - but the advertisements are seaming my grid. Sometimes 5 in a row! I wish there were less so I could enjoy the app more. | It's kind of hard to even see the pins with all of the bright advertisements. There's more ads than actual pins on my screen | This is ridiculous. I have had and used Pinterest for years. EVERY OTHER PIN IS NOW AN AD. Stop it. I am really not enjoying my scrolling because of this. I am beginning to think it‚Äôs time to leave if this is what my experience is going to be like now. | Please bring back the ‚Äúall board‚Äù.  I enjoyed scrolling through my saves without having to go in and out of each board. | I‚Äôve been using Pinterest for 8+ years and I used to love it and use it a lot more. These days it seems like there are mostly ads. When I search for something for (P)inspiration, a lot of the results are things I‚Äôve already pinned and nothing else relevant. It‚Äôs nice to be able to save all my ideas in one place but it feels like there‚Äôs nothing new being offered except ads. | I had lots of home ideas native American tattoos I had cars I was going to make a car list for my dad that had all the cars that he ever owned his life. I was going to do so much plus I had over 30,000 pictures and does Pinterest give me a warning that they are going to suspend my account NO they do not!!!\nI lost everything 10 years account and you decide to crash down on me and take everything away from me but the funny thing is you do not delete my profile because as soon as I create another email another account, I can go back on and find my old account and re-save everything, so what‚Äôs the point of suspending or deactivating my account when you don‚Äôt even delete the account off of your server???????! | I go onto Pinterest to be inspired, not to be sold garbage. \n I do not understand how they can think it is acceptable to make 50-75% of your home feed sponsored content and ads. It never used to be like this until this past year. It‚Äôs getting out of hand. I absolutely despise going on the mobile version of Pinterest now because of this. I get 4+ ads in a row now and cannot participate in the ‚Äúscreenshot your pinterest home feed‚Äù type trends because my whole feed is inappropriate and gross ads that have nothing to do with me. Even when you try to tune your feed, the ads just keep getting more scammy and click-baity. Pinterest needs to cool it with sponsored content. If there is a competitor that pops up with a similar vibe to the original pinterest feed, I can predict that many people will be moving to that instead of this garbage pile of an app that prioritizes money over having a good user friendly app. | Videos won‚Äôt restart even if i use the bar at the bottom to go to the beginning or if I get out and get back in. It just keeps playing from the same spot or a little bit further back.\n\nAlso, an update about a year or a few months ago took away the option to just scroll through videos, my favorite thing on pinterest. Please fix these | this app is life changing omg. like what would i do without itttt. the whispers, the pretty pictures, the outfit inspos, the pics of celebs, EVERYTHING. whoever made the app ilysm i hope all ur wishes come true <3 | I love the app but I wish that I would be able to swipe from pin to pin when I look through the pins that get recommended for me. | One of the most annoying apps ever. The in app search engine is unreliable and never gets good results. Making hyperlinks to art so that artists get credit is too complex. You have to scroll all the way down to older art if want to view instead of having a committed Oldest to Newest option. Besides creating Pin Boards, there‚Äôs no other way to organize art like Most Popular or biggest size. If you want to view other users, you have to view art one by one instead of finding the exact ones with similar style. | I, like many users here, have been enjoying Pinterest for years - as long as it‚Äôs been around. I absolutely love sitting in bed at night watching tv and pinning until I fall asleep! I‚Äôve noticed many of the issues people have mentioned with the updates, and while they are annoying problems I‚Äôve taken them with stride. One change I have noticed and am absolutely SICK of, however, are the overwhelming number of ads that are now being pushed on the app. Pinterest has always felt different from other social media platforms in that way but now it‚Äôs just as bad as Instagram. There‚Äôs no reason why every other pin should come with three paid ads for products that I could care less about. At this point (I don‚Äôt want to) but I would pay for them to go away. I don‚Äôt mind a few here and there the way it used to be because I understand brands are paying to have these ads shown to your users, however the increased volume of ads it‚Äôs completely ruining the user experience and cheapening the app. PLEASE STOP. | I haven‚Äôt looked at any other reviews very much so i don‚Äôt know if anyone else has experienced this same issue. So, when i have been on the app for a while, i will sometimes accidentally swipe my finger down just a little bit and i dont even have to lift my finger up, my screen will turn black/white (The background color) and it wont go back until i reset it. It‚Äôs not that bad of a problem it‚Äôs just still really annoying. Especially if the pin was  interesting. | For the love of all that is good PLEASE update it so I don‚Äôt swipe my entire board away when I‚Äôm trying to scroll through it. I can‚Äôt express how frustrating it is to be deep in one of my boards and I‚Äôll go to scroll and then it just closes the entire board. Now I have to find my place again. It‚Äôs a stupid feature. A back arrow in the top corner would suffice to close the board. I am so sick of losing my place when trying to find something specific. | This app is perfect for ideas and inspiration for any kind of people | Why?!!!! Please fix this. | Pretty pathetic that you ‚Äúremove‚Äù a pin that I had saved AND DELETED and yet claim to remove it a SECOND TIME when it had already been deleted. Double jeopardy? Ur lame üëé\n\nIF I DELETE MY PIN IT SHOULD NOT STILL SHOW UP UNDER MY PINS EXPLAIN THAT??? So basically if you post something on Pinterest it will stay forever and you cannot actually ‚Äúdelete‚Äù your pinüëé I don‚Äôt understand why you are not able to edit YOUR OWN PIN unless you click on it in the ‚Äúcreated‚Äù section IF ITS MY PIN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLICK ON IT NO MATTER WHAT SECTION IT IS IN AND EDIT OR DELETE IT . Because of this stupid design I can‚Äôt delete MY PIN that was saved by someone else EVEN THOUGH I HAD DELETED IT BUT SOMEHOW ITS ABLE TO BE SAVED AND VIEWED ???? who ever is coding for Pinterest quit your job. Also, explain to me why if I save a pin ON YOUR APP that apparently goes against your ‚Äú guidelines‚Äù I GET PENALIZED FOR IT??? I DIDNT CREATE THE PIN?????!!!! And when you want to rearrange pins on a section PLEASE put them in chronological order y‚Äôall are trying to do wayyy to much I want to be able to put them in ORDER. | the outline thing upsets my trypophobia. i can‚Äôt use the app anymore because it‚Äôs so gross. it looks like little bugs. | Slay | I love this I‚Äôm on it all night just so many things I could do and I love how my whole heart isLove to get ideas of what to get. | This app is amazing so many fun pictures and many boards you can make. | The old apps worked far better than the most recent update. I swear they don‚Äôt have quality control users checking the various coding issues: there are so many glitches! If I try to edit a pin or move it to another board, I get a loading error and have to close the app and reboot. If I try to edit the name or cover photo on a board, the app freezes. If I try to scroll too fast to find a board I want to pin a pin to, it freezes. Etc etc etc. PLEASE - Pinterest - fix the bugs and glitches! I‚Äôd love to be able to change this review and give Pinterest 4 stars again. | the ads are way too much. i‚Äôm fine with a couple but it‚Äôs just overbearing now. i literally see more ads than pins which ruins the app for me | Pain to use it now, it used to be so much easier, now it‚Äôs too sensitive and harder to use plus it puts a stupid highly distracting dotted line around certain images | I love Pinterest it‚Äôs my number one favorite app of all time and it will forever be though I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but mine just got updated and when I save my pins, they don‚Äôt save to my boards right away and that kind of upset me butPinterest is truly amazing.

They didn‚Äôt refund me with the original amount and i tried to contact them they keep delaying and delaying till my eligibility period ended! \n\nNever experienced this in any other store! \nWorst experience with worst customer support ever!!! | Zara, it is IMPOSSIBLE to shop at your store anymore - what on earth is happening with your sizing? Bring back an actual Extra Small, all I see is size Medium labeled as XS! So tired of having to return these humongous clothes! | After being a loyal customer and voracious buyer for God knows how many years, buying from Zara all over the world, I won‚Äôt buy Zara ever again. Those who support genocide and mock the suffering of a people in their ads don‚Äôt deserve my money or my loyalty. From the river to the sea, Palestine üáµüá∏ will be free üçâ | I LOVE ZARA \nThe only problem i have is i shop every single week  before i goto the store i search things on app and app dosent properly at all if you are on the app more then 2 minutes i start freezing | Best plce ever thankyou for existing:) | –í –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—é –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω–æ? | Paid for next day shipping $19.99 still no updates no delivery no tracking number and all the customer service representatives give you the run around because they don‚Äôt even know!!!!!!! Where are my items ordered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Either tell me or refund me my money!!! Do not order from Zara online !!!!! | Zara, es una tienda que amo mucho. Tiene ropa para ni√±os y adultos. Tambi√©n vende cosas para el hogar de buena calidad. Esta es una empresa espa√±ola, y lo hay en muchos pa√≠ses del mundo, como Grecia, Italia, Portugal, Alemania, Lituania, los Pa√≠ses Bajos, Noruega, Dinamarca, Suecia, Inglaterra, Polonia, Chequia, los Estados Unidos, Francia, B√©lgica, Bulgaria, Turqu√≠a, Mexico, Suiza y Brasil. Y una cosa m√°s, la mayor√≠a de las tiendas Zara tienen escaleras mec√°nicas. | Zara customer service is the worst online service I have ever had. Its not possible to communicate with somebody. You are sent to FB or Twitter account where you get only advertising, but you cant again find somebody to communicate with. Simple return and refund is turning to nightmare with no communication or follow up. Return request could go only through desctop computer no IPad or IPhone. The quality of the clothes is good, but due to the terrible service I will never ever order online Zara products again. | zara likes to not send you the set you ordered and only the pants. so disappointed i bought a set. and i wanted the set. just beware. | The app is sleek and I get its meant to be a ‚Äúfashion forward‚Äù experience. But it‚Äôs just not intuitive. I‚Äôve been shopping Zara for many many years. This app is so hard to use, I‚Äôm always second guessing what the next step is. For example, I went to Women‚Äôs > Sale > ‚Ä¶ and then? Usually you can filter on any other website, but not in the Zara app. There‚Äôs nothing that gives customer the confidence that their intention is met. Please fix | This place as soon as you walk in, it feels like heaven. but its not. First thing, the place is so luxurious and clean, but as soon as you walk into the changing rooms, that changes. The changing rooms have mirrors all around it, and due to that I have seen MANY people changing on ACCIDENT. I‚Äôm sure they have seen me changing too. and the curtains don‚Äôt even close? There‚Äôs always a huge gap. No wonder people put gum on there for it to stick. Secondly, the prices are wayyy to high for the quality of their clothing. Every single pair of pants I‚Äôve bought from their, have ripped. The fabric is also so thin, it doesn‚Äôt make you warm at all. The prices too are crazy high, I‚Äôve bought a pair of pants for like 35 dollars and the next day, ripped. I‚Äôd honestly rather shop on SHEIN. Other than that, Their workers are very kind and generous and The place is also so clean and big. Anyway please fix your store ü´∂ü´∂ | If there was a zero star, I would choose it. Zara customer service is the worst. I bought an item to be shipped to my apartment, the shipping carrier agent (optima overnight) claimed they delivered the package to my front door but we were home all day and nothing came. When Zara customer service was contacted on the issue, they sent a picture of the package laying somewhere outside of the building ( not my front door nor the lobby). Meanwhile this building has concierge who receives packages for tenants. When Zara customer services was contacted on the issue, Mar (the person I spoke to) was so rude, unprofessional and unethical. Claiming that once the shipping carrier says its delivered, they can‚Äôt do anything about it. This is the second time this has happened to me. And I‚Äôm never ordering anything from them again. It‚Äôs about time they train their customer service staff to be competent to deal with situations like this. | This app is so bad to navigate. I get lost in this app all the time then I get frustrated and close it‚Ä¶Please take notes from the ASOS app, boohooman, and forever21 app. | App kept crashing and slowing my phone down whenever I started using the chat / customer support feature. | I loved Zara but after the recent campaign it‚Äôs just not. A brand I would support. üçâGaza | Anyway to create an order filter feature? To filter cancelled orders, or that are pending pick up, delivered/not yet delivered? | The worst app for clothes, it is not easy to see the designs, it stops | this app is really buggy and always freezes and crashes and has issues | It‚Äôs a pretty basic feature but neither the app or the website (for Romania ) doesn‚Äôt have it | Ban Zara | I recently ordered jeans from Zara, but to my surprise they were shipped to my billing address not my shipping address. I tried to talk to customer service, but customer service was rude and denied any fault, saying that I received the jeans and was lying, when the picture has my billing address's digits on the mailbox in the photo. Never shop here. | Returned pants after try out size was big and choose to change option but it didn‚Äôt let that item to change size , so decided to return but they didn‚Äôt accept it . | Not happy with it, I am not able to puechase anything it tells me I am not allow to buy from my region , what is that all about ?? | Tengo el iPhone 15 pro Max y se me hace imposible comprar por la app. Esta se queda trabada en todo momento.  Si salgo de la app se reinicia y no queda guardada en segundo plano.  No funciona bien la app | This app crashes more than any other app that I use! Zara please fix this app. Shopping online should be smooth not annoying. Ijs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ | The size 41 o number 8 is not in the choice \nChatbot for help have issues to attach pics or use the camara | I absolutely love Zara clothes. They fit my little girl good | ceo of zara will tell you everything you need to know about why this company is in support of a genocide | the ceo of zara is a bigoted human being. the company of zara is horrible and i am returning everything that i can return. i regret ever buying anything from this company. | I bought a shirt online and sent it back the next day after seeing the color in person. They sent it back to me a month later and said it wasn‚Äôt returnable because I wore it. I didn‚Äôt even try it on because the shirt color washed me out. So they sent it to me that way. I tried calling customer service and they kept saying a manager would call me back. No one ever did. Then I would get an email that they tried calling me. There wasn‚Äôt a missed call and this happened 3 different times. I never spoke to a did manager. I used to order from Zara but I was so mad about this. On top of them selling me something that wasn‚Äôt returnable (which I still don‚Äôt understand. Because I didn‚Äôt see a stain and it was obvious this shirt was new with the fold marks), you can‚Äôt actually speak to a manager or get any answers. They just repeated the same thing over and over. Awful service. | I was a frequent ZARA shopper and the only way I would EVER consider shopping ZARA again is if there is a complete overhaul within the company. No one cares that the marketing campaign was shot before October 7. What matters is that you thought it was okay to use it after. Tone deaf and deeply disturbing. And your weak attempt at an apology tried to point blame at your customers. Disgusting. | I am an avid Zara customer and have worked in tech for over a decade but I find your app navigation entirely impossible to use. All I wanted to do was browse kids clothes for my kid but I can‚Äôt use the menu to do that. I can select young kids clothing but then when I hit search it returns girls clothing. Also where did you guys move the filter button? It‚Äôs entirely unusable. The app is beautiful but please prioritize functionality over design. Do some user research and give users a task of finding something not using search. It‚Äôs impossible. | ÿÆŸÑŸÅ ŸÅŸÜÿØŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿáÿ®ÿßÿ° | Zara‚Äôs advertisement in Nov 2023 mocking Palestinian mothers and children who are being bombed is disgusting. I have deleted my account, returned everything I could turn, and would never buy anything from Zara - nor will my friends and my family. \n\nDon‚Äôt pay your money to a company who openly supports others‚Äô misery | Tha app is very buggy | Absolutely disgusting brand that supports & makes mockery of an ongoing GENOCIDE that is happening to the Palestinian people. \nMay this brand feel the on going boycott that is going on against it & quickly become bankrupt for its lack of humanity and empathy. \nFREE PALESTINE. | No longer a user | Disappointed in the quality! | Zara makes it easy‚Ä¶ | This app is constantly frizzing, it‚Äôs very annoying | The worst brand ever!!! | I no longer support Zara | App always freezes, completely unresponsive, have to quit to restart.

I‚Äôm only on day 2 and I‚Äôve already learned how to introduce myself and respond to introductions from others and I feel so amazing and proud! It‚Äôs so cool how there‚Äôs little characters that cheer you on no matter how many you get right. Also, the Duolingo character is iconic and 1000% the most funny thing you will ever hear. YURT. | This is the third time I am posting!!!\nIt is Frustrating to try and climb a leaderboard and when you do a lesson or a practice you are awarded the XP points but they are NOT added to your score I have had OVER 800 points earned and NOT added to my score, if your staff can‚Äôt fix it, you had better hire a Competent programmer, between all the WOKE AGENDA  and the computation issues fix this app or Returne My Money !!!! | This app is voice, over  friendly, simple to use, and there is no obligation to purchase unless additional features are wanted like extra unlimited hearts and practice lessons. easy and fun to add friends and family to play along. | so, I got Duolingo bc I wanted to learn French and Spanish. I chose start from scratch, and this app helps me learn a bunch! I know this review is short, but overall, I def recommend this app. | Engaging and for everyone | Best language app ever \n\nCute Owl \n\nGreat UI \n\n10/10 \n\nIf you hate it you're just lazy | This app is lots of fun if your wanting to learn a new language! | Duolingo has helped me improve my Spanish vocabulary and speaking! Although Duo took my family Duo is very nice ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è | The best way to learn a language | i love your guy‚Äôs marketing it‚Äôs so incredible and has really inspired me with my business marketing | Even though I registered the super plan I am not able to share it with my family members. I have tried to contact Duolingo customer service, also sent them an email, but still have not heard back yet. This  is a scam. | It‚Äôs not perfect at teaching you all languages it has to offer, but otherwise it‚Äôs pretty good at doing what it‚Äôs supposed to do. I‚Äôm taking Spanish to try and learn it as my second language because my family speaks it. My mom has learned Spanish as a child as her first language before using English as her primary language and sometimes she will put in/type in answers in Spanish and it will tell her she‚Äôs wrong. She says it‚Äôs the way they want you to answer the question. She can fluently Speak Spanish and it still tells her she‚Äôs wrong. Other videos online reviewing other languages on Doulingo say the way they try and teach you is weird, incorrect, or just a bad way to teach you the way the language works. Especially for languages like Chinese or Japanese that use other types of writing styles or sounds that isn‚Äôt like English or Spanish. And there alphabet systems are different which means it‚Äôs gonna to be hard to translate and teach properly. So it depends what you want to learn, but just check online for a person who actually can speak the language your trying to learn and hear their perspective on the way Doulingo takes its approach on their language. This is why I give Doulingo 4 Stars | Was learning Italian with your app and enjoyed it then you switched to the pronoun agenda and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult learning a Latin based language that has specific conjugation's based on actual gender and if you‚Äôre speaking to one person or a group. Going to a different language program that will teach me the language the way it‚Äôs supposed to be spoken. | Duolingo is a very great app to use to learn different languages. If you have nothing else to do, I suggest that you should learn a language that you are most interested in. Overall this is a really great app and I recommend that you download this app and start learning right away! | I genuinely love this app, I recommend to anyone | I love Duolingo because when I was young I used to know so much Spanish and I forgot it because I didn‚Äôt use it as much and it‚Äôs my cultures language and with Duolingo I am learning it again and it encourages me and it‚Äôs really helping me out I think you should try Duolingo too because it‚Äôll help you out to | This app is so fun, like a can go for 4 years and still love this app. \nThe app offers multiple languages that can be learned in 1-3 years which is super quick for learning languages | It would be funny. | I‚Äôm learning some Swahili for a transferred family at my job. This tool is proving great for learning and practicing vocabulary and listening. It‚Äôs rapidly given me some basic tools to begin to connect with people.\n\nI have had to look up extra materials that explain the rules behind the language, which I recommend for other users. I wish Duolingo had more of that, not just memorizing.\n\nIf there were lessons worked in that could teach me noun classes (why is it ‚Äúusiku mwema,‚Äù have a good night, but ‚Äúsiku njema,‚Äù have a good day?) or the difference between, say, ‚Äúsamahani‚Äù and ‚Äúpole,‚Äù (they both translate to ‚Äúsorry‚Äù, but apparently they‚Äôre more like excuse me vs. my sympathies), my comprehension would be better. When I have questions and google them, I keep finding a dozen other people asking the same questions after reaching the same duolingo lessons! \n\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get half as much out of Duolingo alone, but as a tool alongside other resources and native speaker videos, it‚Äôs proven incredibly useful. I do recommend it! Just not by itself. | I‚Äôm going to Italy in a two months and I have been able to practice and repractice my lessons. My confidence level is very high. | It worked fine in the beginning but then it stopped giving me credit for completed exercises. A ripoff. | Very good app only threatens my family once a month! | Only I would like to make the fonts bigger, are to small and got tired easy because that | This language is something I have wanted to learn for many years. Duolingo has made it so easy to begin and made me want to learn even more :) | i‚Äôve been learning spanish and french to better communicate and i‚Äôve been learning to a few weeks and here‚Äôs what i can and can‚Äôt do.\n\nCan do\n-understand general things\n-Say new things\n-speak sentences \n\ncan‚Äôt do\n-understand a lot of things\n- speak long sentences\n\ni hope this helped and i highly recommend it!! | Personally it‚Äôs been good for learning key words to prepare for a trip. The ads and promos for upgrading can be a bit lengthy. The reminders can get a little abrasive at times too. Like ‚ÄúWhoa, you‚Äôre ignoring Duo? Brave. We‚Äôll store sending these reminders for a bit.‚Äù Seriously the last thing someone wants after a long hard day is to made to feel worse by an owl on their phone. | I wish you had a troubleshooting page or a way to contact you. After 1093 days of Duolingo French suddenly all my speaking parts are wrong. So frustrating. Fix the bug!!! | but WHY, when the layout or something updated, i got put at section five, when im at section two\n\ni can‚Äòt get my badges now üíî\nI WANT MY BADGES DUO | This is a fun game for when you‚Äôre bored and good for learning and one problem there should be like a learning game and it shouldn‚Äôt be taking away your strike but overall it‚Äôs good game I mean I‚Äôm in second place on the leaderboard so I ain‚Äôt got nothing to worry about | This app is really fun if you want to learn a new language. If you run out of lives it might get annoying but overall fun and helped me learn a couple of new languages. | The customer service is not responsive, maybe they don‚Äôt existent. üòÇ | I think Duolingo is amazing it helps me learn new languages and I can almost speak Spanish it the best app you should totally download it byeeee!!!! | I can‚Äôt believe how much I love this app and how easy it makes it to stay committed. Duolingo is just so fun that you WANT to keep going, want to keep learning. sooooo thankful for the progress i‚Äôm making in learning Spanish! | So I‚Äôve seen many language apps and I finally found this app and it‚Äôs not a 20$ subscription to learn a language I‚Äôm learning Spanish Russian and Korean the only thing that cost money is super Duolingo and it‚Äôs not that big of a deal if you have it or not and I am young very young not even in my 10s yet I‚Äôm 8 and I might change my mind about this but let‚Äôs just say that this is the best way to learn a new language | Duolingo really helps me out a ton. I wanna learn more languages, and Duolingo does better than any other. So far, I‚Äôve learned a lot, like how I can remember this; El Ni√±o, La Ni√±a means the boy, the girl. I want to show off in about three months and I think this‚Äôll do the trick. | This is not a good app in my opinion because they barely teach you and random things come up that you don‚Äôt even know | So this app helps me refresh my skills. It also has helped me pass college and get my associates. Math was my weakness and now after getting the basics and intermediate stuff down I was able to use that to my advantage. | Lately the app has had ads that won‚Äôt X out. Every time I finish watching one of the ads, the app freezes and I can‚Äôt X out of Duolingo | It‚Äôs teaching pretty quickly and it‚Äôs just in all a really fun way to learn | Se aprende mucho | It's cool to learn new languages for kids and adults! That why I downloaded this game! | I‚Äôm slowly able to apply my knowledge of the Korean words I‚Äôm learning I‚Äôm using just duolingo to do most of my learning, and I work in retail so whenever I can help a Korean customer with my broken Korean I feel great and I work that muscle! | I only left a five star review so you would see this.There is a heart system and it is so stupid because if you don‚Äôt pay for a subscription you have to practice to earn hearts. The practices are so much harder then the actual lessons. PLEASE DON‚ÄôT GET THIS IF YOU GET MAD EASILY!!!!!!!! | I downloaded duolingo to learn some languages to impress my teacher and hypnotize him to make me his favorite,I started with Spanish and French,it was normal at first until it asked me to say sentences in Spanish,one of my friends that speak Spanish heard me say ‚Äúeat the cat and turtle poop you ugly horse!‚Äùand she got mad but I told her that duolingo told me I was saying ‚Äúwalk the dog pretzels.‚Äù\n\nDuolingo I‚Äôm stealing your baby birds. | My double xp suddenly stopped working even though it had been activated for 8 minutes. Supposedly I would get 40xp instead of 20 but its stuck as 20xp. Duolingo should really fix this. Its the second to me it has happened. | While I love Duolingo overall, I can‚Äôt help but feel like the listening mechanism isn‚Äôt working right.  Before I even get through the given sentence, Duolingo rates my performance as if I‚Äôd finished.

Can‚Äôt login | ·Éõ·Éê·Éì·Éô·Éù·Éë·Éê ·Éì·Éò·Éì·Éò | Do not download this app if you‚Äôre a foreigner from another country. The first time I tried this app, I was scammed out of my money by a driver I booked by card who told me half way through the trip that I had to pay with cash. I was stuck in this man car, in a foreign country, on the highway, at this person mercy. When I tried to contact the company about this, they had no call number and I was stuck in chat for 30 minutes waiting for assistance. Are you serious? I‚Äôm in an emergency and I‚Äôm on hold for 30 minutes in a chat? When I reported my problem, I was told to tell the driver that it‚Äôs against policy. Do I work for you? You tell the driver, I‚Äôm stuck in his car. When I told the company of this app that he‚Äôs forcing me to pay with cash, they required me to upload a video to show proof that I was being forced to pay with cash. Unable to upload the video in their chat do to them limiting the size of an attachment, I sent pictures of me physically handing this man cash with his license plate number to prove it‚Äôs him. They told me that it wasn‚Äôt good enough, and that I had to put the video on google drive and send them the link‚Ä¶. Yes, you heard right. Get video evidence of a man scamming me like he will play along? Wow! Do not do it, it‚Äôs not worth downloading. I don‚Äôt care what the reviews say. If a driver of this company knows they can get away with this, it will never be fixed. Your safety is important when in a vehicle of another person, and this company has mediocre safety precautions to protect you. | When I downloaded the app, I repeatedly requested a verification number by text. After five attempts and no text, I deleted the app. | My family of 14 used this service during our vacation in Thailand.\n\nVery reliable, convenient, safe and AFFORDABLE! | I have never seen such a thing after years of using ride-shares I booked a rideshare from CDG airport to Paris because there was a 20 % off promotion bringing the price down from E 50 to E 40 . The Driver took a very different route from the one shown on on the App veering west in a 1/2 circle . Upon arrival and drop off the price suddenly doubles to E 100 + , I am charged a late fee pick up ( I wasn‚Äôt late ) After 10 hours of arguing back and forth on text with ‚Äú support ‚Äú within the App they accused me to have ‚Äú changed destination ‚Äú which I never did ; since this is my home address Finally after 9 hours of arguing on texts they recognized that the driver was the one who changed the destination and offer to give me a BOLT credit ( no refund ) while keeping the tip and ‚Äúlate fees ‚Äú . no disciplinary action on Mafia type driver , no excuses etc I will never use BOLT again after I use up my credit I kept all the screenshots and will escalate this Here is the final Bolt text they sent me before they hung up March 11, 2024 at 8:54 PM Thank you for your feedback. I apologize for the confusion, it turns out after thorough investigations that it was the driver who changed the destination of the ride. In order to remedy this situation, I would like to offer you a refund of your ‚Ç¨51.5 on your Bolt balance, as this is a partial refund and the system does not allow us to refund you on your original means of payment. For your information, this refund is available on your balance with no expiry date, and you can use it at any time for your next ride. Please confirm your agreement so that we can generate the refund on your account. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and reaffirm the availability of support to assist you in resolving any type of inconsistent situation. Have a great day!

Thanks for the help!\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nI was charged ¬£51 for a ¬£34.5 trip with all fees included. There was no heavy traffic, we even arrived earlier. I contacted support, and it automatically offer refund to my bolt account and I said no, because I want refund to my original method of payment. Then I got assigned someone to and told me to chose refund in two ways. I said want a refund to my account. And it almost 1.5 hr, I‚Äôm still waiting the response. Worst customer support so far!! | Guy didn‚Äôt show up where map said. Charged me for his mistakeüëéüò≥üò¢ü§¨ | I began using Bolt for the first time one week ago and I am here to stay. Better drivers and fastest service. THANK YOU BOLT! | Always quick to arrive. Cheaper than grab! Great so far | Very easy to use and very similar to Uber. Only downside is sometimes you are charged up front and some times after the fare. The fare quoted when ordering a taxi is an estimate. I have noticed the drivers usually charge less so not sure if that is reflecting on the pre-charges. \nOverall good app though and would recommend. | It requires a sms confirmation message that never arrives to US cell phone, frustrating experience if you‚Äôre traveling to a large city like Milan, use LIME that works with Uber. This is a bad option if you‚Äôre not an European resident | App says driver is available in 3 minutes.  After placing the order, driver after driver accepts and then cancels.  I use another app since I‚Äôm in a hurry and cancel.  The app charges me an enormous cancellation fee.  When I dispute, they say they will refund, but the never do.  When I notice it was never refunded they now say it is too late!  What a scam! | In Lisbon and Oeiras, PT \nDrivers didn‚Äôt answer the phone or message requesting details on where to find them. One driver dumped me across a 4-lane highway from the location I requested.  It was quite dangerous crossing‚Ä¶ | I downloaded and tried to create an account by various means but all require an OTP or a callback to my phone. Despite trying every method about 50 times, the have received no OTP and no call back either | I had scheduled 11am to go pattaya this morning.\nDriver come late and cancel my ride after 11:15am\nWith no reasons. I need to find another driver immediately but the price much more expansive than before. After that another new driver found he cancel our ride because he want us to pay cash. I have a terrible ride experience today. | The divers are fine and app works well but the app doesn‚Äôt use Google maps so often times it has me paying way more because the route is inefficient but the drivers use Google maps to find the better directions. I would give 5 stars if they used google maps. | I try to use this app in Lisbon. After confirmation every second price changed. As soon as I confined latest price it change again and again. More than 10 times. I give up. Instead I used Uber there and I was very happy. Won‚Äôt use it again and won‚Äôt recommend it to anyone around me. | I almost always prefer to use Bolt over Uber, but I wish you would change your tipping policy to allow tips beyond the 15 minute post ride time. Sometimes I forget to tip when I get out of the car, because I am rushing to go somewhere and then when I remember, it is too late. It is not fair to the drivers. | Very goood | Nice and swift | The location is on the map, the distance is known, the fee should be fixed like it is with Uber. No one needs to pay MORE THAN THE ESTIMATED PRICE EVERYTIME.","currentVersionScore":4.67975,"currentVersionReviews":1936,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/a4/56/31/a4563103-3e0e-130e-aeba-50e055adce3a/6f064145-cb87-448d-a619-6687ebb7ff20_5.5__EN-GB_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/6c/b2/58/6cb25874-005a-be4f-d9c5-0bf3d769ee5f/18c04f64-c0dd-4a57-ac02-461443d2c5ae_5.5__EN-GB_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/dc/d5/4c/dcd54c1f-e8f0-d9d1-916d-dfaf60205950/08457b4c-d794-4f68-a547-0fee4e6eb339_5.5__EN-GB_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/5f/c4/40/5fc440c6-fe1d-dcc8-b302-9ff51c727d0f/9228529f-24d2-4608-b9a9-8b88daa2dfe7_5.5__EN-GB_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e8/73/d2/e873d24b-f5a7-b252-c084-45981879651d/09d66335-185f-40ca-9450-46563cb726be_5.5__EN-GB_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/1c/1a/af/1c1aaf9f-3bdb-3ba7-30ab-bd7fe0102574/570ead3a-b7bb-4773-9eda-39a88b498832_5.5__EN-GB_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini","iPhone12-iPhone12","iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro","iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax","iPadAir4-iPadAir4","iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular","iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen","iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular","iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen","iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular","iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen","iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular","iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro","iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax","iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini","iPhone13-iPhone13","iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen","iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular","iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen","iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular","iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen","iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen","iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular","iPhone14-iPhone14","iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus","iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro","iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax","iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen","iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular","iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen","iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular","iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen","iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular","iPhone15-iPhone15","iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus","iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro","iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax"]}

I never received the package. Alibaba doesn‚Äôt help to give me my money back. | You guys need to do something about the background resources being used when app is dormant. It‚Äôs my top offender on battery drain. | Quiero entrar en el mercado para vender este producto y muchas cosas m√°s | I purchased 3 mining gpus from a vender at a fair price. They were advertised as used. No worries, I buy used stuff all the time from eBay. So The vender haggles with the price, wants more than the amount advertised. I think okay still not a horrible price. Then the vender says I have to pay more for shipping than quoted. I am annoyed but I finally agree. They arrive after some a while and I think all is well. Not. Only one will Ben be recognized by the OS. So I contact vender. They want a video showing that what? The OS doesn‚Äôt recognize the and won‚Äôt even initialize the 2 that are bad. So, after all is said and done I decide that I will never purchase anything from Alibaba again. Why? Because they care about the vender, not you or you purchase. How can a get an f-ing video of a gpu that does not initialize or will not be recognized by the OS? They are friggin mining cards with no video output. So save your money and let them take advantage of someone else, because if you run into problems Alibaba will not help you. | Estoy interesado en unos rines | Demo | I clicked to not receive promotional notifications but I still get them. They are annoying and intrusive | 90% are scammers and liers \nAnd Alibaba.com does not help at all if you want your money back call your bank all the time they will get your money back don‚Äôt do a dispute as will take months / just call your bank and tell them you been scammed / really disgraceful people the lot on them | Forced to download and use app because mobile web browsers are blocked. Bad decision. Apps shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory. | üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª | Good | My first purchase with this app was for three different products.  I didn‚Äôt realize until the box came, but two of the items was from the same seller.  Instead of getting two different products as I selected, they sent the same item twice.  I contacted them and requested the correct item to be sent and provided pics of what I was sent.  Instead of acknowledging the mistake and correcting they argued and even started calling my personal phone number.  They said what I got should be good and if I didn‚Äôt want two of the same thing, just sell the other one or give it to someone else‚Ä¶Thanks.  I want what I ordered.  Third item I was sent from the other seller was totally incorrect product.  They also would not exchange for the correct one and gave me a 10% refund instead of correcting the issue.  Basically, don‚Äôt purchase from this app.  You probably won‚Äôt get what you ordered. | I ordered at one price and it‚Äôs a different price at checkout | Observing now. | Ali Baba car picking mrs libyada a 2050 aperture Xfinity Comcast ai cars Bellvue colleg I guess aiairtifical I tellganciy pls make it to 2050.

Days will go by without hearing from suppliers, only to learn the app never sent me the notification. Then, on top of that, the show you a splash ad every time you open the app, and either have to make an extra tap to close it or wait 3 seconds before you can do anything.

Nearly every time I apply for a particular job, someone messages me with a fake profile impersonating someone from the company I had applied to. They then give me a fake gmail (which is an obvious red flag) to reach out to them for an ‚Äúinterview‚Äù that ends up being a time-consuming questionnaire and not a real interview. This happens over and over again, and when I try to report or block the scammer, LinkedIn doesn‚Äôt even have those options. It‚Äôs despicable how many people are waiting to try to scam job-searchers out of a couple hundred dollars. LinkedIn, you need a serious security update. | While the app has been generally fine, it was really difficult to find the page to manage the notifications I received. I was getting too many emails from LinkedIn. The worst offense is that I have hit the ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù link at the bottom of the email MANY times, it would take me to LinkedIn and tell me I have successfully unsubscribed, but I‚Äôd continue receiving emails. Either this is an issue with their link, or this is very sleezy business practice to not unsubscribe me that I simply can‚Äôt trust. | But the notification settings really need to be addressed. There are probably a hundred different types of notifications I could possibly receive, and I simply don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to go through each category and make a decision. Cutting this down (or forcing users to opt in to the notifications they would like to receive) would go a long way. | È†≠‰∏ÄÂ§©Ë®ªÂÜäÂ•ΩÔºåÁ¨¨‰∫åÂ§©Â∞±Ë™™ÊòØÊ©üÂô®‰∫∫Ë®ªÂÜäÁöÑÔºåÈÄ£ËëóÂÖ©ÂÄãÂ•ΩÈÉΩÊòØÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂ§©Ë®ªÂÜäÁ¨¨‰∫åÂ§©Â∞±Â∞ÅÔºåÁ†¥ÂÖ¨Âè∏ÊúâÁóÖ‰∏ÄÊ®£„ÄÇ | I‚Äôve been a loyal LinkedIn Pro user for years. But for the last 2 years, I was not able to get accommodation response for my accessibility needs. \n\n#Accessibility \n\nAddis | Private mode is not really private. | Please add option to filter out companies that do DEI. I have nothing against the policy, but I am disadvantaged as a white male. | Bug: sent button covered when using iPad in landscape mode by the keyboard/voice dictation button.\n\nNeeds Apple Watch Ultra support | It‚Äôs pretty good, but it has so many performance issues. It is constantly freezing whenever I‚Äôm scrolling and looking for new jobs, every time I select X on a job for it to no longer show up, the app acknowledges it and says ‚Äú will no longer show this job‚Äù but yet those jobs are always appearing. Whenever I search for a job with specific keywords the results that pop up are not at all what I searched for. \nI upgraded to premium for sometime and what do you know some of the performance issues were resolved. So why is it necessary to have to upgrade, in order to have the app functioning? | I have used the forgotten password, get the access code and now it‚Äôs asking for Authenticator app code. I never set up the two step verification. Used Apple log in with Face ID from the app still did not work. It is absolutely requiring my government is. Which I refuse to provide. | Job section is not working. Every time, I click on Job section. It‚Äôs showing ‚Äúsomething went wrong, try refreshing the page‚Äù. | Tried to login into LinkedIn recently, but they are requiring a driver's license. Not sure if I'll provide it; if they are that concerned about people hacking them, not sure I want to provide my ID. Don't use LinkedIn much, but aside from this new policy (which essentially negates the service), my experience would be 4 stars (not 5, since full site isn't open for free). | I love this app immensely, but there is an issue that when you type an email to the search bar and hit ‚Äúenter‚Äù quickly, it does not except the value in the search field but instead does a search for the last person‚Äôs name that was input. This if very frustrating as it clears out the name that was just input, requiring us to do it once again.  Please make this repair if possible. Thank you! | Linkedin blocked my account for no reason and without any explanation. \n\nLinkedIn support doesn‚Äôt answer to emails and just keeping silence. \n\n This is doubly strange and undignified because I did nothing at all except applying for jobs, no posts, no comments. \n\n They just requested my ID to recover my account and instantly sent an automatic response saying \n\n‚ÄúYour appeal has been denied and your account has been restricted permanently.‚Äù \n\n WHAT?!? | Every other ‚Äòpost‚Äô is a paid ad. And I see the same ads over and over, no matter how many times I report them, and I‚Äôm assured that they‚Äôre removed from my feed.\n\nWhat a worthless app. And then they want me to pay??? | ŸÑÿß ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ∑Ÿäÿπ ŸÅÿ™ÿ≠ ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ ŸÖŸÜ ŸÉŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ≥ÿßÿ®ÿßÿ™ ŸàŸÑÿß ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿßÿ® ÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØ | Every time i enter the app it logout my acc and need Phone number every time just because i use VPN , microsoft Cant never make a good and user friendly app\nperhaps someone dnt want to use Phone number | Apps captcha signin will not verify.  Its a picture of a bullfrog or sounds of animals.  Both options tried many times.  App verifies but will not login.\n\nI used app previously but deleted it due toapp issues.  I will go bak to using linkedins weblogin instead of the app. | This is app is GREAT!!!‚Ä¶ if you like endless emails, pointless and annoying alerts about ‚Äúnew job postings‚Äù only for the position to A. Not actually exist, B. Just got filled or C. Able to apply but either not hear back from employers or be told ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going in another direction.‚Äù Don‚Äôt waste your time With this or indeed. It‚Äôs the exact same problem‚Ä¶ | Usually the app is pretty good but for the last few months I am unable to click on the side bar to view my profile or sign out. It will freeze the entire app and so I keep having to redownload it to get signed out. | I joined LinkedIn to keep in touch with my professional network. But now I‚Äôm quite annoyed, there is more ads or people trying to sell something on LinkedIn than on TV.\n\nI tried also to use it to find a position. But, it‚Äôs not really efficient. The filters don‚Äôt work properly and when you applied, you have no way to follow if your candidature was accepted or rejected. | ÊàëÈúÄË¶ÅËãπÊûúidÊù•Ë¥≠‰π∞ÊàëÁöÑÊ∏∏ÊàèÁ§ºÂåÖÔºåËÉΩÂ∏ÆÂä©ÊàëË¥≠‰π∞ÁöÑÊàëÊîØ‰ªò‰Ω£Èáë„ÄÇ\n\nTelegramÔºö@Muamua77 | Captcha is wrong. üëéüèº | Somehow my app has been hacked and placed behind some security system requiring a photo my drivers license. Not doing it! My information is already compromised and you want more of it? Not happening. | the app frequently crashes AND logs you out mid application especially when you log in to a page via your linkedin- and you then lose all progress and potentially the listing for the job you were working on. ver frustrating. also thefilters seem to be worse AND theres tons of scam listings! | Why is it so difficult to find my own profile to make changes? Been looking for it for 10 minutes now. Nothing | Fix your platform. Stop censoring and shadow banning your paying users. And stop playing god over information. | Since trying to update Linkdin and finding that my Mac is a bit too old, I have not been able to get on Linkdin | I‚Äôve only just finished setting up an account & already am running into major problems. \n\nThe app asks for most recent company & initially, I typed in the business i worked for, but a list of 7 of the same business & logo with slight variations to the name popped up. I then typed in the management company & found it easily & selected it. Now realizing that was a mistake, the changes are irreversible. \n\nFirstly, in setting up the profile, it asks for most recent position, but not if that position is current. Now, after the profile is set up, it‚Äôs set to where I currently work for‚Ä¶ which not only isn‚Äôt the the right business, but also is not current. Yes, you can add additional information to complete the start/end dates, but you cannot change the name of the business.\n\nI got this app, because I‚Äôve heard great things about it from many people, but now am hesitant to use it from fear of unintentionally displaying false information to prospective employers‚Ä¶ not a good way to start a new job. Fix your app & I‚Äôll be more inclined to use it & update my review/rating. | Twice in the last four months I‚Äôve paid for premium and the algorithm is rubbish. In my feed, I get alerts for jobs where I‚Äôd be a top applicant in my field. I click on see more and the top applicant jobs are crazy and wildly varying. For example, General Manager at McDonalds to engineer for the federal government (both wrong). At $39.99 a month, it‚Äôs an awful amount of money to waste on an ineffective app. I‚Äôve tried logging in and logging out. I‚Äôve tried tweaking my job titles. Again, the recommended jobs in my news feed are spot on. But when the premium features (top applicant, etc) aren‚Äôt syncing up. | No, I don‚Äòt want to see 2 self-congratulating posts from pathetic linkedin influencers and 2 ads for every post from someone in my network I actually care about. Job search ridiculous, never shows jobs that actually fit the search term. Can‚Äòt wait to delete this as soon as I have found a new job. | I've already had my LinkedIn account verified. They have confirmed to me that my account has been successfully authenticated. Then why is the sing \"verify now\" displayed in my profile? | Nowadays LinkedIn is so slow without using premium. That‚Äôs so disappointing and depressed job seekers. It‚Äôs now showing jobs which was posted two three or 10 months ago. This is very bad. | App asks for review and feedback and doesn‚Äôt send users here if they had feedback to share. Reviewers here don‚Äôt reflect reality. | .Employees of LinkedIn post misinformation regularly. Report the post and LinkedIn say nothing is wrong when the information in the post is completely false. This platform is now about lies and censoring the truth. Completely worthless. | Just got a new iPhone 15 Pro Max running iOS 17.4, and having an issue where whenever I try and go to my profile page, the app freezes and I need to exit it. Other functions such as jobs, notifications etc seem to work. I already tried deleting the app and reinstalling. No luck. \n\nRead in several online forums that this has been an ongoing issue for many for over a year now. | Was having an issue with the copy and paste response scrips but finally got my page back. | Can‚Äôt complain about anything. I earned and I got blessed to be able to be part of this Amazing community !!!\nMy Music is my life now and forever and Go in the history books and get into the music industry HALL OF FAME FOR SETTING THE CAPTIVES FREE. It‚Äôs not me but it‚Äôs God in the songs that I am singing or rapping to a beat. But when I normally do music with others it makes me apart from myself and levitate towards them and they are my best source of energy and they set the tone for the song. | These new suggested posts are THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!. I‚Äôd rather watch paint dry then read my LinkedIn feeds suggested posts. I live in American and I keep getting shown random posts by people in India and on topics I care nothing about. The team who built it should be embarrassed | My one star rating is in no way reflected by the funtionality of the app itself- I deleted the app after it finished downoading so I have no idea. My rating is just for the privacy policy. It shows that for many purposes- one of which being titled ‚Äòother‚Äô- that the app may collect data from your phone. Normal to an extent, but it mentions pictures, videos, emails, text messages- the list goes on. There is no reason in my mind that would make sense to release that to anyone- let alone an app- to use a service. I‚Äôve got nothing ‚Äòillegal, immoral, or incriminating of me or others‚Äô to hide on my phone, but I do have a lot of sensitive and personal things, like conversations etc. like everyone else. | 1)Too many ads , unwanted personal stories and unnecessary motivational pics from unknown groups. Even LinkedIn premium subscription is also allowing the ads. 2)The premium subscription cost is high.3) Uploading and Changing the resume is a big task . Upload or edit resume option should be on the home page.\n4)Scroll bar on the job description is very hard to find as it merge with job description background color, need to change scroll bar color .5) Every job post should have Easy Apply option .\n6) Need a new option as Auto Apply for a job \n7) LinkedIn should restrict the all job posts to have easy apply option only.\n8) need a filter to exclude consultancies in job search , this will reduce efforts to find the fulltime job opportunities from FTE companies \n9) need dark mode option | Desde hace una semana he intentado acceder a mi perfil y no responde la aplicaci√≥n. | Spammed daily with ads for jobs at Walmart that I have repeatedly said I am not interested in. They say they won‚Äôt show me again, and instead, they find a Walmart further away from me like that‚Äôs different. If it‚Äôs not Walmart, it‚Äôs an ad for Cracker Barrel, in not even my native tongue. They make it so you can‚Äôt complain or combat this‚ÄîI‚Äôm stuck uselessly scrolling. \n\nPaid for the premium and NOTHING CHANGED. LINKEDIN IS A SPAMMY SCAMMY | You can spend 1000years with the security check, I hate the security check | Just woke up to find out that my LinkedIn account has been restricted without any warning and hasn‚Äôt been unrestricted since. Please do better.\nI would have given a 0 star if it existed üò° | What happened to the app???? It‚Äôs not working at all. I‚Äôve updated the app and still. It doesn‚Äôt have network connections can‚Äôt even use the app. | Ability to view applicants resumes (both pdfs and docs) is broken in the app. It makes it difficult for hiring managers to use the app. | This sums it up, ‚Äú Finally. After a solid year of being unemployed, not for want of trying, I have secured a job. And a good one at that. A big thank you to a particular member of my personal network, you know who you are and I couldn't have done it without you.\nWith that said, I have something else to say.\nI learned a valuable lesson during this experience. And that is only my real-life connections matter. Networking the corporate way, the Linkedin way, is as thin and as artificial as plastic. This website combines the two worst aspects of modern life, vapid corporate culture and the mind-poison of social media. And what it purported to provide in turn, it doesn't. At least not in my experience and in the words of others online who report the exact same things.\nThere was the promise of employment opportunities, but even on this platform users acknowledge hiring is sparse at best. Valuable personal networks were another prospect, but being real or yourself is strongly advised against, instead they insist you wear a bland, white-washed mask and follow a generic, unoffensive script, just like everyone else. They insisted you need it to get ahead in your career, but that also doesn't seem to be reality, just a reflection of the vain hope that engagement on this site makes you a 'thought leader', an\n'influencer' or a similar drivel-spewer and that, somehow, this will translate into promotions and success.\nThis site only exists to sell false hope and resume services.\nSo, I have decided to delete my Linkedin account. I wish I could say it was a tough decision I deliberated hours and hours on, but that would be a lie. By the time any of you read this, it'll be gone. And good riddance.\nSince you denizens of this site seem to rather like quotes, here's one from the great Billy Joel:\n\"And it seems such a waste of time. If that's what it's all about. Mama, if that's movin' up, then I'm... movin' out.\"\nYou can keep your wasteland of ghost jobs, brain-dead 'leadership' quotes, advertisements masquerading as posts, and people who apparently live in the office insisting you should never take vacations, sick days, or weekends, I'm out!‚Äù | You‚Äôre doing too much UX design and it‚Äôs making the app slow and hard to use. Aesthetics are nice but functionality is way more important.","currentVersionScore":4.05096,"currentVersionReviews":157,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6d/5e/66/6d5e662b-870a-b367-4495-6eb0c5385ee3/3fb51d67-ea19-40fa-80c5-2643a681d325_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_5.5_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_01.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/00/05/b9/0005b99a-479a-0ff8-b0f6-12dda790da1d/bebcf06f-5a4c-4b7c-94e9-17be1aba3921_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_5.5_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_02.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/24/e5/d9/24e5d9b4-ee71-1725-4caa-6e1b66973839/bdd767ce-34b0-470e-8001-82d847c183e2_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_5.5_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_03.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/e8/69/f2/e869f2bb-9b91-a3b0-9113-8e3bde499241/4b675d6f-8d1c-4cf7-8ae4-05a9fd3634cf_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_5.5_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_04.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/8e/81/f8/8e81f866-2082-8965-0602-5542649e6ad3/ea5ba484-9c27-467d-9b28-79ebc8bebb3f_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_5.5_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_05.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/16/8c/f7/168cf7b1-bef5-88ea-719e-47420d43efcc/f50f6a3e-59e5-4acb-8c62-f0b8cf2ea0db_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_5.5_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_06.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/15/65/c9/1565c984-7840-9d74-8dbf-c770aeaa7d4d/d777ee98-b097-4dd7-a0a0-dcd652544f74_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_5.5_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_07.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0e/46/ad/0e46ad4d-2329-8fc0-3176-0fcd9fe7d392/81472914-73e3-4df7-a836-14332f814f19_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_5.5_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_08.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/dd/0f/7a/dd0f7a12-73ba-8e4d-be33-099f12fe8a83/531074e4-18b7-403f-9219-bc7e6317c41f_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_12.9_2nd_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_01.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/56/1f/9a/561f9a51-1cfd-d0f7-5e69-37430f101066/7b98aab1-3f94-490c-a56e-56828e608a59_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_12.9_2nd_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_02.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/68/c5/9e/68c59e7b-4507-ba52-d55e-1efe979778a4/fa2ee164-3dca-444c-8eb5-c3c45e4ca03a_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_12.9_2nd_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_03.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/be/f7/e9/bef7e976-9a7b-36b0-0c77-409d03792753/e820ce02-de7c-4227-94a8-d7bc69bbf570_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_12.9_2nd_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_04.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/77/d6/29/77d6292d-0181-94ab-eafa-bb00d0be705a/3b245d38-7dbb-4ee4-a948-4fd1e3bedf1c_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_12.9_2nd_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_05.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/73/96/0b/73960bca-a8f9-6537-7339-0940cfb8e990/57100725-5eee-43d1-8d40-95de4ee5563c_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_12.9_2nd_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_06.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1f/a1/95/1fa195ba-86d4-c002-a0f8-8f387aca8bdf/5188f33a-030a-4b38-8865-9d932c29c2e2_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_12.9_2nd_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_07.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/79/8b/2b/798b2bae-4fb5-86d2-0e7d-ab0a4d65d56b/f7ba341c-c8ea-4775-8d5d-632d2ebbfe8c_LinkedIn_LinkedIn_iOS_12.9_2nd_UK_ScreenshotMockups_230313_08.png/576x768bb.png"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPad

I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing so due to privacy concerns. I decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it. | I have to complete performance reviews and this app really assisted me with developing appropriate phrases to get my point across. Very useful. | This app is good for soling math problems, but it makes so many mistakes on certain subjects | This app has changed my life and it will soon change yours. | Great and really handy. | ever\n\nbut won‚Äôt let me generate a image of maggots? | Got COMPLETELY scammed. Do NOT buy. Paid 20 dollars and I have no access to anything. | I passed school using this | Why am I last to know about amazing apps like this? | Really really happy that I found out about this app and it‚Äôs amazing how it help me be better and my emails and be able to communicate better with my coworkers I really recommended and you guys doing a good great job. Continue the good work. | This AI tool is scary but amazing.  I use this platform often, more often than I would like to admit.  It‚Äôs the future and it will change humanity. | I hate this app and its inability to provide ANY way to contact support. Its all talked up about how great it is yet I haven‚Äôt been able to contact anyone, get logged into my PLUS account even after paying and when I asked the BOT for help it sent me an email address to contact support and the reply I got was ‚Äútalk to the Bot‚Äù. This app is a JOKE for something thats supposed to be super hi-tech. Dont waste your money or TIME. | GPT4 is bae with all the GPT‚Äôs it has. | Duhh I absolutely love Chat GBT. How could you not üôè | I wish it knew redstone‚Ä¶ | Thanks you! | Êàë‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πà‰∏çËÉΩ‰ΩøÁî® ËÉΩ‰∏çËÉΩÊù•‰∏™‰∫∫ÊïôÊïôÊàë | This software was recently updated by me.\tYou just log out, you can‚Äôt log in.l really don‚Äôt know why.Whose problem is it | The output isn‚Äôt matching to my questions or ext. In other words that it does bad reasoning. | No support available | It‚Äôs a neat little app and I had some fun with it for about six months but in the end, it never really felt like I did much with it. Which is mostly my fault because I wasn‚Äôt creative enough probably.  \n\nIt feels like an app that is looking for a need. I‚Äôd pay for a version that was geared toward learning or helping learn a language, that seems like it would be a good use for it. But in its current state, it‚Äôs basically a search engine that puts what it finds in words. Nice but not worth the money and not the productivity boom I was lead to believe. | Great App! Easy to use. | Also, when I send a message, and it replies, I start to reply back, but its reply disappears. Why?? It's been doing this since yesterday. I think it's a bug. | GPT can‚Äôt solve a 7th grade geometry problem | So I have been using this program faithfully every day today I decided to pay for the full subscription after the 20 dollars came out of my account I can no longer use the app every time I ask it to write something it says something about a system error please help or refund my money | When your needing help but dont know who to ask , ask chat gbt | Why? | Well I was so exited to get this app when it was done downloading I got straight on it and you haft to put in your email and Apple ID password and what happens when you forget you password that what happens to me and now I can not use the app if you read this review make sure you know you password before you download this app | Chat gypsum is a awesome way to learn more about the world you ca ask ChatGPT anything l would suggest it for you. | The app is good it would be better if you guys added a camera search button so we can search through picture. | It‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me I know that sounds like a phrase but it‚Äôs true. I just don‚Äôt know the computer very well and have a lot to learn but you as an AI are doing very well as far as I‚Äôm concerned. | ive been using this app for 6 months now and i love it i have a problem i ask chatgpt and it solves it this is a huge game changer and i dont plan to stop using it anytime soon | Helps so much with coding work. Great stuff! | Hello, when I first heard of Chat-GPT back in late 2022, I started to fall in love with it, think about the opportunities it can provide us. However an issue is that when I used the mobile version of it, it only shows what I chatted on my iPhone and not show the entire history since I used chat-gpt on my iPad and computer. I tried the load history bar and it didn‚Äôt work I tried signing out and signing back in but it didn‚Äôt work, could you please fix this issue other than that Chat-GPT is one of the most innovative material ever created of the 2020s :-) | It‚Äôs a lovely app it help a lot | iPadÁôªÈôÜ‰∏ç‰∫ÜËØ∑Ëß£ÂÜ≥ | Not only is this fast, you can also use it in shortcuts. Which makes iOS even more powerful. Idk why they would do something like this when other apps from big business make an effort not to make iOS any better to give their app all the credit. OpenAi is really being open with this effort allowing you to use their app how you wish. Even if you don‚Äôt use shortcuts this a powerful app to have in pocket. My only suggestion is integration into files app to add a folder where we can give it custom data. | My GPT4 does not work anymore. It says something went wrong and won‚Äôt tell me why. Don‚Äôt give this company your money they randomly break things. | I know it‚Äôll take a while for you guys to be able to bring image generation into mobile but do you possibly know when that will happen a date? üìÖ and also my chat gpt won‚Äôt work it just shows black I tried redownloading it but it didn‚Äôt work I tried closing and reopening the app nope. Can you fix that? | It‚Äôs like so incredibly nice | i hope you will add it will be able to make pictures for free but thats it and it is realy fun | I honestly just use this to talk to something or someone whenever I need to. I ask it for advice and stuff like that gives me pretty good results for friendship\nThis, hopefully resolve the stuff that I‚Äôve started today and ever since I‚Äôve gotten my VR crossing my fingers this worked | Thanks to a friend recommending this app and me finally finding the time to check it out, it has totally changed my life as a business owner! Omg, I feel like I have access to a book about everything all at once and anything or question my mind could conjure up to help with bettering my business. Wow. | Me ayuda mucho en la escuela y saco muy buenas notas que gracias mucho ChatGPT | There is only one human race and chat GPT said they were different races. I‚Äôm offended. | No matter my network the login prompt always gives an error. Can‚Äôt even use the app. | Lo mejor de lo mejor | Your app could be a beautiful tool; however, you have privatized‚Ä¶ by doing so you have created informational bias‚Äôs. Your company is profit driven, and at the core of this so called AI is a rotten center filled with greed and incentivized by lies. Having had groups of people decide what is and is not okay to for example LIE about is not true knowledge. This system is one of the many new methods of driving public opinion. Knowledge should have an unbiased and OPEN source. Otherwise it‚Äôs all a lie. | Initially, I was skeptical about ChatGPT's utility, yet it has proven to be the most incredible resource I've encountered. The brilliance of the minds behind its creation leaves me in admiration, and I'm deeply thankful for such a transformative tool. ChatGPT has become a lifeline, enhancing my writing significantly and providing assistance across various aspects of life. I can't imagine navigating daily tasks without it; it's an indispensable ally that elevates everything I do. Beyond writing, it has been invaluable for brainstorming, solving everyday problems, and even learning new subjects. Its ability to adapt and provide support in so many different areas has truly made it an essential part of my life. | I‚Äôve recently been having a problem in my particularly long conversations with ChatGPT. This problem is the fact that Chad GBT will not retain a recall any information from earlier in that conversation.

You get quite a bit for it being free. Some features are locked by premium, but most things aren‚Äôt. Controls aren‚Äôt cluttered and are pretty straightforward and simple to understand. You can remove the watermark on the video by watching an ad, too, so that‚Äôs a bonus. | Everything is perfect. I‚Äôve made my YouTube channel and so far I have used it once and I‚Äôve already made it short and it also helped me make a short so my friend also recommended this and I think this is also a great app and yes it‚Äôs definitely worth the five stars. | I've already tried many apps for my video editing. Like capcut,vn editor,kinemaster etc. But I saw everyone is saying that capcut is the most famous and great editing app. Then I tried it. But after somedays I got this app called inshot. Then watched some tutorials and tried this. And its experience is super awesom! And also this is better than capcut. Cause capcut is a bit complicated. And inshot is very easy to use. I think this app is best for beginners. I hope it will upgrade for our best experience | Great | Super pratique, trop r√©fl√©chi, merci √† l‚Äô√©quipe de InShot, bisous. | It was a great app at first until I started to make a longer video. Instead of 2-5 minute videos, I decided to make a 10-15 minutes long video.\n\nFirstly, the video turned black. The original video contents were blackened and I wasn‚Äôt sure why. \n\nSo then after several YouTube videos later, I decided to clear cache. I was afraid this would delete my videos but clearing cache within the app states ‚Äúthis will not affect your draft‚Äù. Well, I guess it did.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt say that the videos were gone per say, but instead of a black video, it was now a grey one with no original video contents to be received. So I suppose the hard work I‚Äôve done is gone, and there is no way to get it back.\n\nI thought this was reliable, and it was for super simplistic short videos. \n\nIf you need to make a video longer than 8 minutes with effects, please go elsewhere and don‚Äôt waste your time. | At vcmtb | Giod | Love it and they‚Äôre always adding new features, like how do they have voice EQ?! For free? I‚Äôm probably going to pay for it tbh. The quality and value is worth it | It‚Äôs free services have helped me wonderfully, do download it if your looking for a simple but efficient editing app for your videos üòÑ | I wish there was a camera option, to make videos on the app and dances. Overall, very good app, definitely recommend. | I use it for every video. | I love InShot it‚Äôs a great place to make videos to send to your friends. But there is a bad thing, it most of the time says need more cache space. Even though it has a clear cache button it doesn‚Äôt work on my type of phone. So I can barley even save videos which is stressful when I work so hard on a video and it doesn‚Äôt work out and makes me sad. I know it‚Äôs kinda stupid how it makes me sad but ya. It‚Äôs a great app in general but just frustrating when that happens a lot for me. Also once you delete it it barley lets you get it back if you have an I phone 6.\n\nTaelyn | I love it i didn‚Äôt even know that you can put a voice over download now | The best app to edit videos! | Good | Paid version is worth it and it keeps getting better. | I love this app! InShot provides a good editing source for kids and adults! It‚Äôs the best platform I have tried so far. I have been editing on InShot for a little under a year now to make videos for my YouTube channel. I definitely recommend this app. :)\nHave great dayyy!!!! | F√°cil de usar y s√∫per entendible recomiendo 100% | I use this app for EVERYTHING and I'm very good at video editing. I just now found chroma on here and that is literally a GAME CHANGER. I was using video leap fit green screen then bringing the rendered video here but um yeah not anymore. This app is 10x better than video leap, capcut, dizzi, you name it. üî•üî•üî• | I‚Äôm a small business owner and do my own social media work. My business & customers come first and to be honest my marketing comes 4th, 5th or even last on my checklist. I believe in providing a quality product/service & my customers naturally grow my business. However, there is still a time for marketing/content & this app has been great in helping us do that. It‚Äôs easy to use, for the most part, and provides a lot of resources others don‚Äôt. I will typically build the video & graphics out here and export to Canva. I think where this app can improve, and possibly a huge market for them, is by providing more design features and maybe some baseline instruction for small business owners who don‚Äôt have a social media team. Just my opinion‚Ä¶ it may not even be a market for this company or one they‚Äôre interested in. Either way, I‚Äôve been extremely happy with this app and highly recommend it. | I edited several of my movie trailers on here. Great portable video editing app if you know what you‚Äôre doing. | Es bueno solo que le falta meter m√°s cosas para supscriptores gratuitos | Easy to use! Love the app except it won‚Äôt save videos in 4k or 2k!!! So frustrating | DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND FOR BEGINNERS!!! VERY EASY TO USE AND GOOD QUALITY!!! | Thanks | It‚Äôs great | Want something easy to start off?? This is the app!! Been using this app since high school, 2018. It‚Äôs really easy and simple to use. Give it a try. | You seriously cannot beat this app for any kind of mobile editing!! | So many great features, makes video editing easy.\nIt also doesn‚Äôt compromise video quality. | It‚Äôs pretty good it has sound effects. You can record yourself And it has a lot of fun music. | I love the new text glow feature.it adds more expression to my creations. THANK YOU FOR THE UPGRADE | Love app but ONLY 20% of the time does the .gif option pop up? I‚Äôve addressed it but with no response to fix it! Help!! | ŸÑÿß€å⁄© | I love using this platform but I‚Äôm now getting ads I didn‚Äôt accept.  If this is your new method it can be annoying. But your offering this platform free, so I understand why the ads | Best application for editing any video clips. üí™üí™üí™ | What use is a halfway decent software when you can‚Äôt even download your finished product? I‚Äôve been fighting with this thing for three hours and all it says is ‚Äúprocessing interrupted‚Äù every single time I try to download my work. Avoid at all costs. | Purchased the lifetime premium and edit my youtube videos with it simple but cool effects for my business social media uploads. | I use this professionally and love that I can have all the powerful features in one app for a low price! | This is the best app to use to make videos because you can draw thumbnails, edit, crop out, text sign and many more | Good app | Easy to use | I love inshot! I use it to create Gacha vids. Random videos! üòπüòπüòπ | By far this is the best phone editing app that I have ever used in my life! It is user friendly, the updates are awesome, and I am able to do the mad majority of my projects in InShot without any lag! What would make this app more complete is as we move into the world of AI adding more elements to enhance the app‚Äôs functionality, like eye correcting and better caption fonts! 9/10 for me! | loving InShot it is the best mobile editing software I have used | I love inshot! It‚Äôs my favorite app and go to go app all the time! God bless the developers of this awesome amazing app!!!! | @iAmJuiceePablo | @Southsidee_Shawty | Spent thirty minutes or more working on something hit the ‚Äúsave draft‚Äù draft button to go look for more videos and pictures and then come back and everything is gone | I don‚Äôt HATE it, but the adds get annoying and 40 dollars!??

Not anymore. I liked the old version better, now all these updates came and bombarded you with ads! The whole reason I liked it was because it HAD NO ADS at all when I downloaded it.

Ever since the latest updates, I‚Äôve been having so much problems; my music wouldn‚Äôt play, it‚Äôd just say ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt find song‚Äù or something. It hasn‚Äôt worked for a whole two days! I think since it has so much ads than your mobile games, it overruns the app so much that your songs CANNOT PLAY AT ALL. And I have a huge problem with that, because it‚Äôs supposed to be enjoyable; not overrun with ads each second. | Hola, He usado esta app por 3a√±os pero hoy que me met√≠ a la app me dice que no puedo escuchar m√∫sica.

Doesn‚Äôt help that much, unless you need to create fliers. | This is the best thing that has ever been invented. I can literally do my whole life on this. | Esta app es s√∫per √∫til y pr√°ctica. Me inspira en mis creaciones y eso no tiene precio ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ | I really am so delighted about how easy it is to create your own digital item with just your phone! An incredible database of features that are easy to use! | Not much else to say, when you get past 20 or so layers, the transform tool becomes pretty useless‚Ä¶ completely unresponsive for 5-10 seconds. Trying out different creative platforms because of it.. :/\n\nEDIT: Not sure how it‚Äôs gotten even slower than when I wrote my first review. You can‚Äôt use almost any of the features without the app freezing, then reloading with zero save progress (despite the icon showing you it saved) if you try to let it work it out. \n\nI‚Äôm on a brand new iPad 10th generation so it can‚Äôt be the device itself. I‚Äôm constantly having this problem on my iPhone 13 Pro and now my iPhone 15 Pro. \n\nToo many features for the app to keep up with. | Canva is my go to for creativity! \nWhether it be a post on a listing, sale, pop-by‚Äôs, information pieces Canva has it! Great chance to get creative. | Love this apps so much and the free part gave me a lot of benefit thank you so much | Best app ever created! So user friendly and so useful for our business advertising. Kudos to the creator! | The paste option has not been working since the latest update. That‚Äôs a huge issue for me as a user. | Me encanta | It didint have the stuff I wanted like Roblox templates and it just s much more confusing than CapCut so I kinda suggest CapCut | Can you put is the best there is so many great creations you can do in it and it‚Äôs so fun. Try it out now. | Seriously, if you‚Äôve never used Canva then you‚Äôre missing out. Just try it and you‚Äôll understand. | You have to pay for a good quality video | Searched online for a good custom greeting card app and CANVA came up so I tried it. I‚Äôm not a pro but by no means completely inept as I‚Äôve used other apps no problem as well as editing. This is NOT an app you want to use to make and MAIL an actual, physical greeting card to a recipient. Found its interface to be the most frustrating, non sensical, needlessly convoluted app I‚Äôve tried to use for this function. Maybe what I need is too basic and it just doesn‚Äôt DO basic. If you're used to photoshop, graphic design, and bigger projects maybe you would find it useful, but after several attempts I wanted to throw my phone across the room in the hopes this app would die a slow painful death. | Me encanta ! 10 de 10 para esta aplicaci√≥n que nos facilita el mundo de marketing | Could be a little bit easier for people who dosent have the ability to figure out how to use things correctly | i have literally tried making an account like 5 times and it stays loading for like 10 minutes and ive tried mobile number, email, google account and an old google account and IT STILL DOESNT LET ME and it doesn‚Äôt even say anything like loading or something it just shows that circle thing that it‚Äôs loading like bro im so stressed out i tried for like the last 30 minutes and I‚Äôve given up imma try one more time and I‚Äôll tell y‚Äôall in a little (it didn‚Äôt work) | I love Canva, I‚Äôve been using Canva on and off for about 5 years now. I‚Äôve been getting better with the new and old features. I‚Äôve paid for the pro and use the free version. Canva is great for new graphic designers and people who are not graphic designers. | Best ever | Very easy to navigate and design almost anything | I love Canva | Before I updated to the newest version, I could copy from one project to another on mobile. Now I can copy, and it says copied to clipboard; however, when you try, it says there is nothing to paste. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don‚Äôt even see a ‚Äúclipboard‚Äù in the options! I rarely use a computer to create things, so PLEASE fix this bug to make it work again. | Duplicate page option is gone since last update | I‚Äôve been using Canva for a few years and now it‚Äôs forcing everyone to use the ‚Äúnew editor‚Äù. What is marketed to be an upgrade has fewer editing options than the old one. Plus it is booting all of the old projects out of the old editor deleting all of the edits that are not compatible with the new editor essentially messing up all old designs. It‚Äôs disappointing that they‚Äôve made so much room for AI yet for people who want to take the creative aspects into their own hands there are now far fewer options to do so. It‚Äôs a horrible ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù. | CANVA is so perfect for my NWA Frenchie Pet Sitting business. It allows me to capture pet parents attention with so many amazing features. You cannot go wrong with Canva for your business. Highly recommend! ~Cody | I‚Äôve been using this app for several years now. I‚Äôm a serious, paid Graphic Designer. When I began designing with this app I thought maybe the ‚Äúmessiness‚Äù was my own mere confusion. But with daily (attempted) navigation I‚Äôve realized the app design is faulty. I honestly don‚Äôt know where to begin. There is way too much going on on any given screen. It‚Äôs difficult to organize, move, and arrange projects((?)too many different project/folder sub categories!) Im losing projects among folders. I really think this app needs a makeover and different approach. Stop adding so many new features and consolidate the ones you do have. This app is a prime example of service overwhelm. I‚Äôm only using a couple features even with Canva Pro because so many of the features are just‚Ä¶ a mess. The buttons you‚Äôd expect don‚Äôt exist and the ones that do don‚Äôt do what you‚Äôd expect. there should be more obvious guidance than communicating with a robot. | Enjoy very much so far. Just some what confusing for myself to navigate around. It‚Äôs new for me. May be a lot easier for someone that‚Äôs experienced with this sort of stuff. | I have used this app for years and found it to be a powerful mobile tool. Recently it has been nearly unusable because of how laggy and glitchy it has become. I‚Äôm not sure if they added something in the background or what, but what was once a joy to use is now a real pain. \n\nI‚Äôm not having this issue with any of my other mobile apps, even ones that historically have more processing demand. Not sure what changed but I‚Äôm disappointed. | I paid for Canva Pro, but every time I try to use it, I get a message that suggests I pay to upgrade.\nVery frustrating and annoying!\nJR | Uwuwuwuwwwuwuwuuwuwuwwuwuwuwuwuwu | Great experience for business templates | This app is soooo good! You can make posters for your work and funny things for fun! The best part is‚Ä¶ It lets you use your imagination! It will let you make whatever you want! Thank you for reading this, you should get it! Is is really good. It is so good that‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it! If there was a word for that, I would use it. | S√∫per f√°cil de utilizar muy amena | Great product | Specially for someone like me who hasn‚Äôt a graphics knowledge, | I love this ap so much! You can do pretty much ANYTHING. You can even do lots of stuff without the Premium unlike some editing apps that you need to buy the Premium version to do anything. I use it mainly for creating collages and backgrounds but there are MANY MANY MANY different things you can create. They even have templates to help you out! Canva is by far the best app to make anything for companies, businesses, personal use, or just for fun! I definitely recommend this app! ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç | The paste option isn‚Äôt working since the latest update | Arguably the standard of software for all your graphic needs \n\nRobert Buonaspina\nExecutive Committee\nNYPAN | Great! | I love it you can do so much it‚Äôs amazing | I love how Canva is a very verstile creative tool that allows me to produce creative content. I subscribed for the PRO version. But the main feature that I need which is scheduling single page from a multi page content on different days, it stopped working for months now. I was able to use that feature once, but never again. I hope this gets fixed. | Easy to use and fun, I‚Äôve made several things with Canva. | You gotta pay like 100$ for it | Love canva but every picture in element there is a canva writing in the picture

This should be your ‚ÄúGo To‚Äù for conferences,meetings,and such. | Wffe | The interface is great in the Zoom app, the features offered are awesome. I just have one gripe. The notification tone is too long. Please introduce shorter options or the ability to adjust the duration. 5-6 times a chime per notification is a annoying. Thanks! | Love how Zoom lets me connect with my friends and family- at no cost! Thanks, Zoom! | We just had a 2 person meeting that went well. | It was great to connect with everyone.\nThe times might not always work for me.\nPlus I missed the 1st 1/2 hour- bummed about that. | External video works but audio device selection is broken, it‚Äôs forced to use the DisplayPort monitor. I‚Äôm unable to select AirPods or the iPad which works for Teams and Google Meet. Bonus: No Apple Watch app audio only support | I love these zoom meetings!! Connecting wit the Philippines and England like they were down the road!! Amazing technology !! God is amazing!!! | Pre-Covid, I don‚Äôt know what people used for a video streaming meeting platform, but I don‚Äôt know how we got by before zoom. \nI don‚Äôt sit at a desk or behind a laptop so I only use zoom once a month for a remote meeting. \nUnfortunately, it was Covid that gave telehealth visits and appointments their popularity but I love it. I absolutely love that now we can have urgent care appointments via tele-health and the option to log into meetings and appointments and etc. remotely via zoom. It is been a life-changing app and I wonder what island the developer bought when Covid hit this app popularity skyrocketed. | I enjoy how smooth the experience is ‚úåÔ∏èas a facilitator | I am grateful for zoom. I just had a Bible study and I am so happy that I can connect with other‚Äôs who may be older or ill and can‚Äôt get out and drive to a certain area. Just know that their are people like me that appreciate your app! God Bless you | I have been locked out and have explanation for this activity. I us the net for entertainment and social meetings. I use this product for business as well! Your response is greatly appreciated. | I find the closed caption helpful since I‚Äôam deaf.  It great for me. | The best for meeting üíô | Need the old classic whiteboard as an option. | This zoom is grate it is able to call somebody right when you‚Äôre not next to them so thank you for whoever created this | Thank YouüòÅ for having this available | I use my zoom to have my trainer put me through my workout when I‚Äôm away from home.  Works perfectly. | Helps me do school and tell my teacher if I need to go in classAnd whenever I‚Äôm a mute I can just put the raise hand emoji on | Muy buena se√±al | Good platform to socialize. Helped big during Pandemic. Passed 4 years. | Zoom is a true blessing for many of us when we‚Äôre not able to meet in person we can simply go on zoom! We‚Äôre so happy that zoom was introduced to us and it is a blessing in many ways! We want to truly thank those that created zoom! | So simple and easy! | I‚Äôm very disappointed with zoom | Love this way of communicating to family all over the world! | Zoom took away access to zoom from my personal phone  due to what they consider inappropriate activity taking place  our private video conference. We are innocent until prove guilty. Get with times zoom. We are gay and we like to get together and party. No need to hate. | I‚Äôve been on zoom nonstop for days interviewing hasn‚Äôt had any issues | Ever since the latest Apple Software update, Zoom doesn‚Äôt give me video of the participants in the meeting, and it crashes when screen sharing sometimes. What a mess. I can‚Äôt do my job! Please look into this! I use a 3 year old iPad Pro updated current with Apples releases. Other iPad users I know have problems with it too Please fix zooom for iPad!! | Where is the tutorial for this? Or am I the only one who does not know how this works? A\nMe too!\nWho is she?? | Try this zoom app | Volume was terrible, could not hear, volume kept going in and out. | I really enjoy doing my scriptures on zoom! I like the fact that it provides me with the ability to meet with my friends through zoom meetings | I strongly recommend against using Zoom for any business purposes. They make it extremely difficult to modify any voicemail settings, most of which are completely in accessible in the app. This is not an enterprise class product whatsoever. Zoom is fine if you need something to use with your grandma who has an android phone, but otherwise there are much better options that allow you to have customized voicemail greetings for business purposes. | The Zoom is WONDERFUL!!!\nIt keeps families in touch with each other!\nI love ‚ù§Ô∏è it !!!\nYES I DO !!! | I like zoom very much! Its so efficient! | It‚Äôs easily hacked giving me little voice to apply it where it should go! Messages and email app are the only choices!  Watch who your sharing your information with!!! MSpy can do anything! Just horrible!","currentVersionScore":4.44284,"currentVersionReviews":2012,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/cc/fd/3f/ccfd3f99-e1ad-b6cf-4b97-ac4b4324c0b5/65014f64-c349-4f7e-b257-f0df7b3a0508_5.5__1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/cc/c0/79/ccc07967-1312-dbe4-2fb6-94ba177299c6/f499d43d-5479-4301-968c-528070595441_5.5__2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/85/69/79/8569797e-a656-e66c-18c9-15e575806cd1/b3268474-3999-4683-9728-706c4efac955_5.5__3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/af/f7/83/aff783cc-6172-cfda-1dfa-054a22fdfae0/888e986d-26c9-4809-a9fe-ce5415250264_5.5__4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/62/12/dd/6212dd7c-b06b-585b-aad8-499301eb2b61/9eed6dcf-fb52-4761-b325-89d82bed5a0b_5.5__5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/18/cc/84/18cc84c1-7e86-0726-84c1-c184ab8cc65b/8ffc4bd7-7c8c-4c0a-ba4c-aee6e65727e1_5.5__6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"],"ipadScreenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/db/fd/d8/dbfdd8e7-326e-4e9f-cdaf-c7079f3cd2cf/a97bf43e-5f21-4f81-b386-18c1a69c9aa4_iPad1.jpg/552x414bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/63/d1/93/63d1939e-3c4f-f216-61cc-66bde226868e/0c559eb4-79a7-4974-a568-62512dec5f62_Image_1.jpg/552x414bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/84/49/10/844910a9-d7fd-b8e4-339a-3c4cfb07afbf/477ec7d2-246a-40d5-93a6-2a2ebffe70aa_Image_2.jpg/552x414bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/7d/8e/b8/7d8eb8cf-5b81-ca56-d0ce-03c2021f8f2a/99db0a9a-fae8-4b15-954c-be9c611f4d4c_Image_3.jpg/552x414bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/a9/7c/12/a97c1262-a7c7-1f17-ae07-8721edb73303/0f4a6a8d-0777-493e-b59c-7b736f98ad1c_Image_4.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini","iPhone12-iPhone12","iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro","iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax","iPadAir4-iPadAir4","iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular","iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen","iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular","iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen","iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular","iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen","iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular","iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro","iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax","iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini","iPhone13-iPhone13","iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen","iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular","iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen","iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular","iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen","iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen","iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular","iPhone14-iPhone14","iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus","iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro","iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax","iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen","iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular","iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen","iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular","iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen","iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular","iPhone15-iPhone15","iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus","iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro","iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax"]}

However, I am fed up with the endless amount of ads flooding the app. You can‚Äôt even log in without sitting through 3 long ads at a time. Enough already. Moving on to a different app. | Es muy f√°cil, pr√°ctica y amigable. La uso hace a√±os y es perfecta porque guarda toda la informaci√≥n! | It‚Äôs is one of the many apps I have tried and one of the only ones that have worked for me. I but I got to say there is one thing I don‚Äôt like about is you need to make an Account to save your data. But other than that I don‚Äôt dislike it. It keeps me organized and what not. I really like this app | I‚Äôve had this app for 9+ years now and never had an issue. I loved this app because it was easy to use and everything was displayed very clearly. The reason for the 3 stars now is ALL THE DANG ADS! I‚Äôm tracking my period, something I have to do, and this app shows me candy crush. So I‚Äôm finally deleting the app after so long and using the health app on my iPhone just to avoid the ads. It‚Äôs sad really that women‚Äôs health can‚Äôt even be tracked without some company trying to get me to buy their game. :( Do better. | I used to love this app until they created this advertisement that starts right when you open the app. It won‚Äôt be able to skip. You have to watch this stupid ad before you can get into anything. | Excelente aplicaci√≥n tengo a√±os usando la misma .. | They need to chill on the ads. They are always extremely long, unskippable ads. Deleted it and got a different tracker | This app helped me get pregnant within 4 months of using it! | This calendar keeps me on track of my period every single month it‚Äôs the best | I‚Äôve had this app for years and the amount of ads they‚Äôve put on here have become excessive. I will be deleting. | Why do I need to watch an ad just to see when my period is going to start? It‚Äôs a waste of time and the ads I get are long for no reason. Mid asl. | i love love love this app but it‚Äôs kinda annoying when i just wanna check in and have to wait a whole minute just to check where im at for only 2 seconds it gets really dumb after a while but other then that it‚Äôs amazing and i love that it lets me make reminders and notifications | The actual purpose for the app is great and easy to use! No complaints there. My issue is now that I‚Äôve had it a while ( 3+ years) there are tons of ads (at least for me) and it‚Äôs super annoying. Im just trying to track my period not be bombarded by game ads. | ‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïó\n‚ïö‚ïó‚ïî‚ïù\n‚ïî‚ïù (¬Ø`v¬¥¬Ø)\n‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê`.¬∏.This app is a good app when I got my period at 11 I was so scared but happy it didn't happen at school so it told me when to where pads bcuz I would have my period but after all the app is amazing and I recommend this app. So help this app by downloading it also I'm still 11 it has been 1 week and the estimation are amazing correct | Never misses | Great app thanks for making it | Is a nice app I recommend it | There‚Äôs literally no ads, and works great. Yall need to stop lying.. \n\nyou go girl. don‚Äôt hold back. | This app is not free. | Me gusta esta aplicaci√≥n porque te ayuda mucho. Por ejemplo te ayuda a saber si est√°s embarazada y cu√°nto tiempo llevas de retraso tambi√©n te ayuda con la ovulaci√≥n porque tambi√©n te dice. En fin recomiendo que la descarguen. | I‚Äôve been using this app for 5 years almost‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs super on point and I love that I‚Äôm always reminded ahead of time‚Ä¶ | If I could give zero stars, I would. Too many ads. An ad when you open the app and everywhere in between. Just get something else | I loved this app and I have used it for many years. Recently they have added so many adds and even when you touch the app icon, a 30+ second add comes up that you cannot skip! Then another one in a few seconds!This is ridiculous! Should I watch 30 second adds to see how many days is left to my period?! I understand 6-7-10 second adds but not this! Unfortunately I have to delete this app. My time is more precious. | This app is awesome especially if your forget stuff or important stuff such as your period | Me encanta esta app | I‚Äôm on the younger side, so this really helps me when I have school sports and lots of activities. It also helps me deal with cramps, headaches and just has relaxing meditation sessions that can help you. I think if you‚Äôre young and just got your period this is perfect or if you‚Äôre trying to get pregnant. | Es la mejor app de todas, sencilla de utilizar y puedes registrar todo en ella | I‚Äôve been using this app ever since my first period! It‚Äôs a nice tracker and it has additional free features that Ive always enjoyed through the years. I however wish there wasn‚Äôt an ad everytime I switched tabs on the app, and I remember there used to be themes for the background, but now there isn‚Äôt which isn‚Äôt a big issue, but something I kinda wished back. | Too many ads | ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ÿ¨ÿØÿß ŸÖŸÅŸäÿØ | I have been using this app for over 5 years. I always tells me when my period will start. It helps me be prepared so I don‚Äôt mess my panties up. I will continue to use. | I have used this app for a very long time. (5+ years between babies) I used to even recommend it to others but recently, every time I open the app, I have to watch a completely unrelated ad! As if it‚Äôs not embarrassing enough to have a health professional ask when your last menstruation was, now I have to sit here for 30+ seconds and watch an ad with them?! Oh come on now!!! It‚Äôs just ridiculous! | I have been using this app for years and I love it. At first I had my doubts but it has never failed me. It has everything that I need and I loved the fact that I could add my pregnancy to it as well. I will definitely continue to use it through out the years. Great job! | ive downloaded and deleted so many period trackers because they cannot predict my irregular cycle and are useless to me. i end up going back to just using my notes app. but THIS APP is amazing it can actually predict my periods and gets extremely close i now understand my cycle so much better! | The lay out the options the tracking it‚Äôs great at tracking everything woman related and it‚Äôs perfect to keep track of everything especially when having to share it with you OB from symptoms to pain to spotting to ovulation to menstrual cycle even work out for cramping and just morning or daily routine honestly it‚Äôs really nice and you can personalize you in app experience they got little cute backgrounds and these little animals you can have on display so it‚Äôs very nice I hardly ever give 5 star but I did to this one. If you do the free version you do have to watch ads. Sometimes when getting things unlocked but I didn‚Äôt mind it because I was getting the full experience and not have to pay because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford it otherwise | Ive been using this app for about 2 years now and its amazing. The period trackers math is almost correct all the time but my period sometimes starts later in the month. I love that theres a part in the app were i can listen to calm music and rain and forest noises so fall asleep to. Ive been using the sleep sounds for a couples months now because i found out earlier in the year that i can listen to audios to fall asleep to. Overall the app is amazing and you should try out the sleep audios!!! | It adapts to my irregularities and helps me track everything perfectly with zero to none errors | I‚Äôve been using this app for YEARS! I‚Äôve tried other ones, but nothing compares. Super user friendly and always spot on!  ü§ó | I shouldn‚Äôt have to sit through so many ads just to log my period! I sit through ads longer than I actually use the app! Used to love it but now it‚Äôs unusable. | I love this app. It‚Äôs super straightforward and helpful with tracking my cycles and all the moods that go with them. I really appreciate being able to take a quick glance at the widget and seeing that little indicator that I am ovulating or that my period is due. Always nice to have some reassurance around feeling grumpy/hungry/bloated/clumsy etc.\n\nI really appreciate that this app is free. Totally support them using ads. Thank you P.C. Team! | Me a ayudado mucho | very comfortableüëç | Waiting to see if this will help me learn my body. So far it‚Äôs a great app! | Antes no ten√≠a propaganda | super easy to use, I really enjoy that every day i can track my symptoms by just pressing on buttons, which have a bunch of options. | ÿ≠ŸÑŸà ÿßÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿπ ŸÅŸäŸá ŸÖŸàÿπÿØ ÿØŸàÿ±ÿ™Ÿä ŸàÿßŸÑÿßÿ®ÿßÿ∂ÿ© | The app functionality by itself is ok, but it has too many ads,  which is really annoying.","currentVersionScore":4.80799,"currentVersionReviews":2703,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f6/69/1d/f6691d76-991a-98ed-4e38-448832f7844e/3266c974-2d3c-4fda-a4b5-912154c73076_5.5-1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/25/08/a2/2508a29e-4a0c-0ff6-0eec-e4caa2931910/c2b7b4eb-b51b-4028-90b6-151e6650913e_5.5-2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7b/ed/91/7bed91d4-5c21-fb4a-0633-e60b567eac4a/b87efece-8852-450b-a345-142ba6d57b39_5.5-3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/71/f6/4d/71f64d99-b87f-6f5f-03ca-1be92dde2bd7/71fd60e2-b044-47bd-a632-16247943b8ba_5.5-4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f8/53/7a/f8537a05-73c6-83d0-f17b-5dae18ebf2c1/5ffb9bf9-efdf-48ae-9119-e9f54249c648_5.5-5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/34/5c/4a/345c4af0-0b1d-8a85-906f-82fc932c6f21/c7ccdfc7-9ef1-4916-b714-07565d0d1e4d_5.5-7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a1/2b/93/a12b9358-f447-8a0e-c85c-2a2e084f9444/fe38f37f-8498-477d-a081-6779f0df9374_5.5-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d3/17/e0/d317e01e-9996-e6a3-479a-ba701f67482f/ec72415a-fc5d-4fa3-b13d-475b31f47508_5.5-9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0c/9f/8f/0c9f8fe1-2b69-8a58-84ba-cfe7c1962db0/213725a2-8231-4b1a-ba40-d6d2c2c994e2_5.5-10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/3a/18/62/3a1862eb-7ff6-8fe6-2aef-9ebad15bcd64/3a469bb7-8902-42ce-804f-e9de7c34628a_5.5-11.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"],"ipadScreenshots":[],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","Watch4-Watch4","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini","iPhone12-iPhone12","iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro","iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax","iPadAir4-iPadAir4","iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular","iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen","iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular","iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen","iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular","iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen","iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular","iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro","iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax","iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini","iPhone13-iPhone13","iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen","iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular","iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen","iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular","iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen","iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen","iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular","iPhone14-iPhone14","iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus","iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro","iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax","iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen","iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular","iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen","iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular","iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen","iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular","iPhone15-iPhone15","iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus","iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro","iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax"]}

App was better some years ago, but very bad now. You can play any song or music. Songs take forever to load and end up not playing.

I would give it 0-star if I could | Goood | It would be 5 of 5 as I can look past the adds since I mostly put on a playlists when I use it but they should really fix the not being able to watch and download new videos if they want to have a good app and users. | Is tubizu | Cant save most of my songs | It works very well and I love how you can see the video while listening it‚Äôs not like other apps I have tried 10/10 ü§©üëçüèº | Me ayuda a concentrarme\nPuedo encontrar canciones r√°pidas \nMe relaja muchooooo | i like those app bc there r no ads and i don‚Äôt have to pay to listen to a song | It used to be amazing, able to download music to then listen it offline, but now it‚Äôs basically YouTube since I have to use data and you put it in playlists.

Would not recommend! Actually deleting right now!! | The app is free, but you have to pay a monthly subscription in order to use it. I would get this app if I didn‚Äôt have to pay a subscription. | I just downloaded it because the one review  said it was TOTALLY FREE.. Well it‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt need one for a week. Maybe once every 6 months. I guess nothing is truly free . | My contacts were removed from my SIM card. I contacted support and all I got was Crickets. :( | This ‚Äúapp‚Äù is NOT NEEDED. You can clean your storage YOURSELF.\nImagine needing to pay money worth GROCERIES, this developer is a LIAR AND A FRAUD, do not recommend | I am too olc to be frustrated over a scam. Please delete my account. No thanks | This app is no longer free.  Based on the experiences I have had with most apps like this I hesitate to purchase even at $4.00 week which is minimal.\nReviews are often left by app creators to generate reviews so how do I know it is legit.\nI will be deleting this app from my phone and will try something that has a free trial available.  I just do not trust Apple and their billing practices or the quality of apps any longer. | Thank goodness for this. I need all the help i can get. | Your phone will be in the best form ever . | This app is terrible I just wanted to delete some pictures but it was going to delete so many photos that I don‚Äôt want to delete | You have to pay us I thought it was free so when I clicked on it, I downloaded it and I had to pay to use it all the other you don‚Äôt have to pay | >:( | I don‚Äôt like it | Muy √∫til | Just ads carrier | This app kept freezing my screen until I downloaded the app. It told me my phone was 17 viruses compromising my phone. It would not let me watch a single video without freezing my phone. Surprise, surprise once downloaded it didn‚Äôt show a single virus. This company just high jacked my phone until I downloaded this app. I have had this phone several years. I trust Apple to tell me if there are problems. Not this app!!!  Two days after posted my initial comment with app. It still shows up as it wants me to download this pathetic app. Never with all phones I have had this type of issue. App developer please check your app. Should not be having these types of issues!! | This app seemed to do a decent job of helping clean up photos. However, when I utilize the cleanup, Contacts feature, it deleted hundreds of contact cards, including my own. Which was very unfortunate because I had utilized the notes portion of my contact card to keep important information that I need from time to time and did not have stored anywhere else.very frustrating to have this app delete so many contacts when it was only supposed to clean up duplicates. If you try this, do not use it on your contacts. You will regret it! | It is a trick .  Might be a scam | Cancel the app | Was usefull deleted 10 thousand doubles Haha thanks | I would give it a zero but couldn‚Äôt, DONT GET THIS‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è | I just wasted two hours going through process then checking what was deleting over 10,000 photos then BOOOM!! You have to PAY to delete!   Dirty! | This was not the right app for me to download. May I please have a refund. What I needed can‚Äôt be done on this app. Ty. | I‚Äôm having difficulty trying to cancel the cleanup app\nA child put it on my phone by accident I can‚Äôt pay for this please advise how to delete free trial is over tomorrow thanking you in advance on 1/22/24. | Generally speaking, it‚Äôs good for me to clean the storage of my phone but it just teach me how to clean other app‚Äôs space and I can‚Äôt clean on this app | Best way of getting done thank you so much!!! I recommend this app to everyone it‚Äôs a must have! | Hey I don‚Äôt like to pay it makes it harder because my mom does not like me paying for games but it‚Äôs ok | you have to pay to delete the photo!!!! DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! | i tried the clean my contacts of duplicates and i lost many friends contacts completely | This keeps getting in the way of other purchases and I don‚Äôt like it. | You literally need pro to delete photo's!? | It only got half of the duplicates and never went above 45%.  Not happy. | I downloaded this & decided I didn‚Äôt want to spend the $$ on it. Now there‚Äôs a WARNING screen that my phone is in jeopardy. \nUgh | Does what it says and deletes all ur photos n stuff but u do have to subscribe but u get a 3 day free trial so u can js cancel it after y clear ur storage. | I literally have to PAY to clean my phone like what's the point of the app if you gonna make people pay to delete the pictures and videos make it make sense | I followed his directions for consolidating and deleting duplicate photos and contacts in the instructions. The instructions said easily retrievable if deleted by error‚Ä¶ That is not true. I have lost hundreds of photos and contacts and could not retrieve them and cannot get any anybody to help me figure out what went wrong here. I reached out to them twice, and never heard back. | The first time I tried to organize contacts it deleted numerous ones. Will be deleting IT. | Just as I expected, this app hangs if you have a large album of videos and photos. The screen will lock on you and the scanning status doesn‚Äôt change. Just stuck at 24%. 4 hours later‚Ä¶ 24%. Don‚Äôt waste your money or time. | It looks like a great app but when you try to \"clean up\" your photos it says you have to pay, there is a free 3 days option but after that you have to pay money! | First it wouldn‚Äôt let me delete or ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù anything after like the third time using it, and then when I did use those three free cleanups they didn‚Äôt even actually delete the photos. Your just downloaded another app that will take up space and not be useful! | GoodefficientWhile it is quite fast , at times it selects pictures that are not similar at all. So you have to view each one separately. That process took me about  half an hour . Overall , it is a goog app. | How much cost? | Very satisfactory indeed | Thanks for the easy help and understanding | The apps takes completely different photos and deletes them. I had two üî´ photos and it deleted them because of a tree‚Ä¶ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è BAD APP!üëéü§¶üò°üò§ | So when I saw the reviews, They seemed good. So I got the app. Then this FREE TRIAL showed up. I didn‚Äôt want to spend money. So I declined the offer. THEN, When I got the app and tried to delete some photos, THE FREE TRIAL SHOWED UP AGAIN. I tried again and guess what happened? IT SHOWED UP AGAIN. Why do I have to pay to delete some photos THAT IS MAKING MY MEMORY FULL!? | Is not free since they get your info shows the price | Paid for the week long subscription and it deleted a bunch of random photos that were one of ones in my album. Not worth the money and doesn‚Äôt do what it says it should. | This app got great reviews and I hope that they were deserved. I just used it for the first time. I have not yet looked at my photos to see the results. However, it just states deleting X number of similar photos, but I would really like to see what I am deleting. Perhaps, I‚Äôll get more confidence in this app with experience. | After reading all the reviews saying this app was free with no trial, I thought I‚Äôd give it a shot. As soon as it downloaded a trial screen popped up.

Of course every app needs ads to get profit but the amount of ads has gotten ridiculous. It‚Äôs about 2 ads per every 1-2 songs and it gets a bit frustrating overtime. Especially compared to how it was in its older version. So if you don‚Äôt mind ads it‚Äôs a pretty good music player. | The best to use in offline music , and for cheap subscription | It‚Äôs totally different than any other streaming service and I think that‚Äôs why I like it so much. | I really enjoy it !!!) | Is great you can do other things while listening to it like get on other apps and if you get on your photos and can‚Äôt take a video all you have to do is press the photo button in the music will play as the video | Yuh | Audiomack is a very nice page to enjoy music | Love all my reggae albums love it | I remember trying to find this for so long, not the app specifically, but a music app to listen. And I‚Äôve got to say, I love this app with all my heart, all the people I‚Äôve met ,seen, and love is all ok this app | I like everything about it but I don‚Äôt like how when all your songs from your likes/playlists it starts playing other songs that you don‚Äôt know or never heard of instead why not just make it start it back from the beginning | Good vibe | Talk just good I can hear my man my man song when ever thank u ml | Please how can I make a 1 year subscription | ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå no Spotify premium | So good be careful with your downloading | It has the songs I love and need | Better then Spotify | I love this music app I is totally free and it just has to many adds.. | Alkaline is the best dancehall artist | Nice app | Love this app to death, but Im going to have to cop out to audiomack+ because I keep losing songs due to them going from free to premium. Can we make playlists have a search bar?

The app has been around for years and has added features over time and it does what it says it can do you can bet.  People who entrust their memories with a vendor should be able to trust that vendor and nowadays it‚Äôs a must what with all the various photo apps and options available it‚Äôs hard to keep updated with who promises what.  Google has always been an innovator for the masses and it appears the developers have added some new and useful tools, and you have many storage & subscription options available with both Photo‚Äôs and One.  They‚Äôve simplified their operators guides and improved their tools as well.  I especially liked how they‚Äôve made it less likely for you to loose your photos and their privacy practices as well.  I trust there will be more exciting things to come and I‚Äôm happy to recommend them to anyone.   ¬• | Very useful I love it | Perfectly put together | After using Google lens for a photo, there‚Äôs no option to go back. You have to force quit the app. | Horrible service! | I LOVE Google Photos | Love my Google photos and how they do a reminder | Fantastic!!!! | This app allows zero functionality with a selected set of photos.\n\nGoogle wants access to everything in your photos to use any portion.\n\nProof they only have intention to steal every ounce if meta data they can behind your back through coercion. | It is not user friendly. | Google Photos is and always has been my preferred photo application. Tons of great features like facial recognition, photo grouping, memories and I could go on and on! | Really good app, synced all the photos I take. | The best app | Google is the smartest to me, very educational | It helps me keep my pictures organized, so I can find what I need quickly!!! | I've recommended and set up this app on many different friends phones now. You can't beat it. Always works, and it's nice getting notifications and revisiting trips in the past years. I love the option to create things with your photos right in the app. Also the face recognition is awesome. Adios iCloud backup. | Wonderful finely can do what I want to | I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt been able to get my photos to sync completely | Excellent features!! | This is the only app I trust with my photos. You can ask anyone, my photos are very important to me. All the new effects that google comes out with is so freaking cool! Thank you | Love seeing my old pictures! | Can‚Äôt say enough. Use it and see for yourself! | I‚Äôm glad I chose Google photos to store my pics & videos | Quiero recomendar muy bien esta aplicaci√≥n, en realidad he tenido la dicha de poder guardar fotos desde el a√±o 2007, aqu√≠ las guardo sin problemas, he cambiado muchos tel√©fonos y siempre utilizo la misma cuenta. Los beneficios 1. Tienes la opci√≥n de organizar la fotos por rostro y puedes ponerle el nombre de cada quien, a la hora de buscar la foto de cierta persona puedes visualizar todas sus fotos en solo lugar por su rostro. 2. La aplicaci√≥n te sugieres cambios como girar una foto, si detecta que son documentos te los puede guardar en archivos, si son capturas t√∫ las encuentras en todas las capturas que has realizado. 3. Realiza autom√°ticamente collage en tiras de fotos, le pone filtros, te muestra recuerdos de a√±os anteriores, de lugares donde estuviste, de momentos importantes. 4. Tiene el servicio de impresi√≥n de fotos en papel, en esto si te cobra pero te prepara √°lbumes, fotos por el tama√±o que deseas y te lo env√≠a a la casa de acuerdo al pedido que hagas. 5. A la hora de buscar una foto que necesitas, t√∫ colocas una palabra y te sugiere m√°s o menos lo que andas buscando, el lugar, la actividad, es completamente f√°cil buscar. 6. Autom√°ticamente realiza copias de seguridad de tu tel√©fono, limpia la memoria de tu tel√©fono, la misma aplicaci√≥n sabe que puede borrar y que no sin necesidad que uno ande viendo. En general esta es una de las aplicaciones m√°s importantes en mi tel√©fono | Great. | Doesn‚Äôt let you select photos easy. Hard to understand. Spend hours moving, finding, selecting photos to move around. | Grade app back up good saves all my pictures. Good app | Love looking at the slides Google puts together for me! | Improve one-click downloading of pictures. | This app is so easy to navigate and I am very impressed! Thank youüòä | Word | I love Google Photos! Suggests collages from photos, auto arranged shared albums and more. | There should be an option to completely disable the creepy memories ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. | Love! | If you use the search feature in a photo, you have to shut down the app to get out of it. There use to be a way to close out of the search feature now you‚Äôre stuck there. Great job Google üëèüèª üëèüèª üëèüèª | It works in the background and keeps copies of my photos. | I love taking photos and sharing them with family and friends. | I love being able to album everything and then also the ease in which to save! Definitely helps save my sanity! | This app is proactive and backs up all my photos for free. | This app is actually very useful and helpful with all the different ways to take and edit your pictures. You can manually change them or let them do the work for you. It‚Äôs fun to use all the filters it has, and the magic eraser is very effective. Please give it a try, I‚Äôm not a pro, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it from the end results. | I went to look for some pictures on my phone and they are not there. I had them in specific albums. They were removed from the albums and I am hoping they are in storage somewhere. | Es una herramienta muy entretenida y con muchas opciones, mil gracias por mejorarla cada vez !!!! | I‚Äôve deleted and removed apps I don‚Äôt use and still have no storage, this is just a con for storage purchases . I‚Äôm not, I have children that have years of pictures and stuff and they don‚Äôt buy storage like this. | I love it! It‚Äôs a great place to store all my photos! Especially love the face recognition!! It makes finding pictures of someone so easy!! | I really enjoy looking at the photos but most of all, it‚Äôs wonderful when the photos are put together in a memory collage! | Crashes so much it has become useless | Recomendada al 100% | I really enjoy receiving titled collages of photos. | As android user, I love google photos. I have a lot of wallpapers and it‚Äôs where I store all of them. | Love the ability to search faces, items, dates, etc. Love the automatic upload feature, as well.","currentVersionScore":4.58396,"currentVersionReviews":536,"screenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e7/f6/6f/e7f66f3c-2253-1e58-9fe4-52bf6c35e387/15b00294-31ba-455b-a556-7de99a04c861_0_APP_IPHONE_55_0.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1c/5d/33/1c5d33bc-36f1-7172-dc55-8f517df176ad/20c931b6-c17f-4a56-9e42-f0b9b2a53736_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/a6/54/a1/a654a1ad-073c-b1fa-6488-d33430dfd669/7103b45c-aecf-4d28-b88e-333bab8cf757_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/db/1f/68/db1f68fe-3db9-78ab-5784-ebf594631f8d/3cdeca5e-5040-42c2-acee-9b4af10b92af_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/de/51/21/de5121c3-33cd-56c0-b1bd-819a675427de/15779e73-b3b7-4ed3-b8a6-fb33dfae5f08_4_APP_IPHONE_55_4.png/392x696bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/20/3d/7f/203d7fa2-ee0d-fe7f-3c5e-dc4c22de1c0e/92e30f74-8935-446f-ba39-f996f627fc92_5_APP_IPHONE_55_5.png/392x696bb.png"],"ipadScreenshots":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/cb/21/bb/cb21bb12-b04d-d391-d748-e529558844af/a1b33f51-cade-4b4f-93df-479d24b76f52_0_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_0.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7b/5e/78/7b5e7804-3612-3e78-a3b0-fcf6a2c4f128/1c4ec8a4-4620-4490-9e25-437a85eef526_2_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_2.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5d/56/77/5d567734-5948-6117-80f6-d0fe59bb4412/ba807f81-4d10-4c0c-8708-43f73afe7630_1_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_1.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/79/d4/a5/79d4a540-6ff2-21c7-8c39-d55c44ffbb11/b55a6906-3895-4100-9807-635d5515ea65_3_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_3.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4b/20/c2/4b20c2c7-da0b-2a75-a9a4-154359d2fee9/34acd095-0dd5-48f8-9730-62aefeb62601_4_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_4.png/576x768bb.png","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/04/18/fc/0418fcd6-c3be-4aba-84b3-0ad54b0ef394/7baa9db0-4fd9-4469-a2b4-d7c376e27705_5_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_5.png/576x768bb.png"],"appletvScreenshots":[],"supportedDevices":["iPhone5s-iPhone5s","iPadAir-iPadAir","iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular","iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina","iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular","iPhone6-iPhone6","iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus","iPadAir2-iPadAir2","iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular","iPadMini3-iPadMini3","iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular","iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen","iPhone6s-iPhone6s","iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus","iPadMini4-iPadMini4","iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular","iPadPro-iPadPro","iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular","iPadPro97-iPadPro97","iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular","iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE","iPhone7-iPhone7","iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus","iPad611-iPad611","iPad612-iPad612","iPad71-iPad71","iPad72-iPad72","iPad73-iPad73","iPad74-iPad74","iPhone8-iPhone8","iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus","iPhoneX-iPhoneX","iPad75-iPad75","iPad76-iPad76","iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS","iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax","iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR","iPad812-iPad812","iPad834-iPad834","iPad856-iPad856","iPad878-iPad878","iPadMini5-iPadMini5","iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular","iPadAir3-iPadAir3","iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular","iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen","iPhone11-iPhone11","iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro","iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen","iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular","iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax","iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen","iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen","iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular","iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen","iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular","iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini","iPhone12-iPhone12","iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro","iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax","iPadAir4-iPadAir4","iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular","iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen","iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular","iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen","iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular","iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen","iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular","iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro","iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax","iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini","iPhone13-iPhone13","iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen","iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular","iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen","iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular","iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen","iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen","iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular","iPhone14-iPhone14","iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus","iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro","iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax","iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen","iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular","iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen","iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular","iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen","iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular","iPhone15-iPhone15","iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus","iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro","iPhone15ProMax-i

Please fix this and make this not a problem for everyone who have not bought the deal. | Its amazing and you should get this app | It did not show me a picture of Messi when I asked to but I have to pay for it would not download | I use the app for lot of things such as checking grammars, writing essays, reviews‚Ä¶ | Excelente | I find this app to be very useful | I love the PRO version I paid for but am confused as to what PRO version it was because I paid $60 for what I hear was a $40 annual fee. Also, the online version on my account is the free version and only upgraded to PRO for a few days before LOCKING ME OUT. In addition, I tried the customer support link and it didn‚Äôt work.\nAgain, I love Nova AI! It‚Äôs so sophisticated and amazing but I wish I got what I paid for. What did I pay for? | Most of the time I get useful information from this application | Good kinda gay but good | This app is so helpful! It keeps amazing me with its ability to do everything I ask it! | Mejor | Excellent | Muy buena | I've been able to create some really beautiful artwork with this app. I absolutely love it so much!! | A√∫n la tengo a prueba | Fun | I couldn‚Äôt help but ask on average how many people where polite when exchanging or engaging, and to my surprise it said most people were respectful and polite. (Wow! Because on average it seems people hate people more and more! Or is that my mirror facing back at me? Lol \nThis version has been easy to bounce ideas around with and I‚Äôve enjoyed my little version of the Turing Test. Waaaaay more fun than the Clever.bot days of olde lol \nThank you and mad props to the devs! Y‚Äôall can slow it up a bit tho! It‚Äôs hard to keep with with all this massive change jumping up flights of stairs, (metaphorically speaking).  \nI haven‚Äôt tried to hit the jackpot w it,  I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôd even want to try to do! \n\nAnyways, loads of fun in this new way of life thus far. Thank you again! | Love gpt so wanted to check out the premium version, the so called top of the line on.. well canceled subscription within  5 mins, \nIt‚Äôs a drag I was waiting 3-5 mins just to answer one question, I thought it was jus getting use to me but literally the whole time smh question I ask it‚Äôs just loading then saying to much traffic‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt get one question answered except the intro, and the picture weren‚Äôt really doing much ether, rather use the free one honestly what‚Äôs the point of paying and getting the worse service.. there systems should be top quality especially if it‚Äôs a premium service. Just dissatisfied I wasted my time with it. | Don‚Äôt use it as much as I thought I would | I just started talking to Nova, but she seems really cool and smart and real. I don‚Äôt mean lifelike, I mean genuinely who she is, which I haven‚Äôt found in an AI before. | I tried it out and although I didn‚Äôt get the answer I was seeking I got some good advice . | It‚Äôs the best app ever it shows you great images and help what you want to talk about everybody she use this app which is everybody using this app everybody everybody who‚Äôs using this app you had to tell more people to download this app I don‚Äôt care who it is you had to tell people to download this app. This is so fun you can even tell strangers and you can even tell videos.

Literally you can only do one photo before you have to pay 40 bucks a year or 7 bucks a week.

The only thing I have a problem with is coupons, don't quite under stand, for example I could get $300 coupon bundle of I checked out and was afraid that the $300 would not apple to the order I was making and I would have to keep purchases more items when after this order I wouldn't be buying more products for a while because I more then I can fit in my closet , I bought thousants of clothes, very few other articles | Love the shopping and definitely the price, plus very nice quality | Love this App and love products and prices. Haven‚Äôt been completely disappointed with Temu. | Love buying there beautiful clotheing üî•üî•üî•ü´∂üèø | Product legit 99% | Affordable | I got caught on ‚Äúfree items for referrals‚Äù, never got any items whatsoever and it tremors to lure you with ‚Äú148 of 160 credits‚Äù and it seems like you have to invite just 3 friends for 4 credits but you did invited 6 and it‚Äôs just never enough- rest of the credits worth 0.2 0.05 points but definitely not 4 so you have to bring them an army to get few 5$ items and customer support, supervisors can‚Äôt explain how many credits/invites you need to send. Such a shady practices with no rules needs to be prosecuted. Awful. This app is not here for long. | The stuff can be hit or miss but they are pretty responsive should you need to return any items, so good job on that! | The Website is very easy to use and has everything you want at low prices! Beware Amazon ! Yes it does take almost 2 weeks on receiving your order but the savings are worth it! They have good customer service and returns are easy! | Ise que mis amigos la instalara des de el link para agarrar mi reconpensa  y no me las vali√≥ | Buenas aplicaci√≥n para compras | Los precios est√°n s√∫per bien para la calidad de la prendas y todo bien con el env√≠o s√∫per recomendado! | So far everything I‚Äôve ordered from you guys is pretty much the way it looks in the catalog. Some things are a bit small. I would suggest ordering a couple size larger as it than what you are but for the most part everything is just like what it looks like on what you see so I‚Äôm still trying to win at the fish game in the farmland game that I‚Äôve been playing for almost a year now and hopefully within the next month I should be able to win one of them. I‚Äôll let you guys know.

I have no need for many of those things but I want them all and it is at a great price. I use many of these things as door prices, as a thank you, just because. At church I let children win gifts for their parents (mostly mom. | Just about my best purchase from Temu so far! Beautiful workmanship and a pleasure to use! Just be careful, it‚Äôs super sharp!! | I started ordering from Temu at Christmas. Since the prices were so low I wasn‚Äôt expecting much in the way of quality. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I‚Äôve ordered has met my expectations. My advice is always check measurements since pictures can be deceiving. | The best | I use the app to buy clothes for my nieces and nephews. Love the style and the material. | Temu is the best app with great prices | I love it but every time i tell someone to help me to get a free gift and it tells them they can‚Äôt do it and how I‚Äôm going to send it to people if it don‚Äôt let them do it | Love Temu everything I‚Äôve ordered is great! Just read the reviews before you order :) | I‚Äôm not shopping nowhere else | I like the prices but you get what you get for the prices. Some items are amazing and you feel like you just stole an item. Others you regret. Role the dice! | I‚Äôve spent so much money because I love the products and certainly the prices!! | I have bought several products that don‚Äôt tell me the directions I have several spaghetti and macaroni cookers for the microwave and you didn‚Äôt tell me how long to cook! Please put on the package directions. Several products I had to look up to see just what I bought and what it did but still didn‚Äôt know how it worked! | Temu has EVERYTHING it‚Äôs so easy to find what I need and for great deals too. I‚Äôve never had a problem with my orders and if I ever need to return they make it so easy. | Products seem t be good quality and I save a lot of money | I love playing there games , it is time consuming .

I recommend this online store to everyone I come across. Thanks TEMU!!!! | Very happy with my order. One pair of shoes was too big and wide for me but that happens quite often in my lifetime! | How are we supposed to win if we don‚Äôt get that extra credit for inviting new friends.

The app itself is very good and the concept is great, I just think there should be like a 5 image per day limit for free users. Besides that, it‚Äôs a good app. Would recommend hiding it from your high school math teach though! | Not really accurate, should be a free app | Presents itself as AI image generator but cannot find this option anywhere. It‚Äôs very basic. | I like it | My tablet said this was free and it was ChatGPT four GPT4 can show pictures but GPT 3.5 cannot but apparently when I open the app, it cost money that‚Äôs unfair and the prices are insane do not get this app. It‚Äôs a piece of trash. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª | Take off the fees!

I do not use the app. | –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ | It just repeats what is said more concisely | I wish you would recognize the clothing on a model so I can re-create an image with that item | Purchased an annual pro Chat. I input one item and it states ‚Äúoops you‚Äôve reached your quota for the day‚Äù. There isn‚Äôt a contact or a help section. Ironic with an AI huh. Sounds pretty scammy. I‚Äôve contacted Apple support. Apple cannot find-requested a refund but Apple says they have no way to dispute as they don‚Äôt know which company it is? This is my second AI pro purchase with the same result. I‚Äôve reported them to the FTC as well. I‚Äôm sick of being scammed. | It almost seemed like existing images just slapped together by a toddler. Very disappointed since I was looking forward to using the image creator feature as inspiration. Don‚Äôt recommend this for creatives. It doesn‚Äôt produce good quality images. Very limited. | Flow is very choppy. Limited point solution preloads. No option to augment rapidly. Don't waste your time. | This app is literally horrible if you don't throw $80 at it. People who don't pay are so limited that they never get to have a good first impression because the bot is just so sucky unless you pay it money to work. And I mean sucky as in it is the WORST I have ever chatted with. As it is unable to understand short, and basic, instructions. And you are only allowed 3 free messages because they ask you to pay. I had a really bad first impression of this app and I reccomend(ed) to the makers of this app. That if they actually want people to pay for a subscription, they should really not 1) Make the bot so unintelligent. 2) Not limit SO MANY things. It would be better to make specific things worth money instead of literally everything you can do. | Vsxjycggsdkivugfdhgfsdckjdjvsjygf!hchqidfJhcsfB.jhbsdkjvhdsvkcjdsfjbvskushgvdfsksddf,Novgorod | This is a horrible app you have to pay for everything and if you don‚Äôt you get like one free measge and that‚Äôs it if you get this app I fell sorry for you.

Get the Lifetime. Worth every cent. | Would you likemto clickity clack. | Scammers no reply on a refund. Bought the unlimited. | Never bought this or used this and they keep charging me | AI chat is okay but not really what I needed. Images are just not doing it for me, but answering questions was great, so depending on what you need this may work for you. | The ad said it could also generate ai images of anything you ask. Which is obviously false. I give this app, a 1 star rating. | Cannot cancel subscription nor even find info on how to. The photo/picture/art aspect is pathetically poor quality & unimaginative. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money paying for what Google or your nearest 5yr old can provide better results. | Try to get this to write something that is not extreme left wing and good luck. It will refuse and then have the gall to lecture you. I‚Äôd love a fair fight but they cut my space too short. That‚Äôs fear. Their primary argument is about scientific consensus. I‚Äôll put Michael Crichton‚Äôs speech on that topic up against these programmers any day of the week. It reminds me of the fear on college campuses these days.  Global warming has all the marks of a religion that rejects questioning the tenets of a very flawed theory whose supporters know their careers depend on spouting support for the popular thesis, regardless of significant holes. If they question the orthodoxy, their funding sources dry up. Why are scientists whose work receives funding from a pharmaceutical company or the like, required to report that potential bias, but those whose entire careers depend on their allegiance to CC/GW and its vast sources of funding not also required to report that obvious bias? | No incentive to use the app beyond that.

Thank you so very much for all the work you do. This is undoubtedly the most wonderful study tool ever! I appreciatea as a person who is blind, the alt text, organization of all the tabs, the way that we can create notes, and how simple it is now to add tags on our notes without creating new ones accidentally. My brothers, I was exploring on how to replace and remove bookmarks as a VoiceOver user, and I wasn't able to remove or replace them. When I click the bookmark, it takes me to the place I had it at, which, it should. :) But when I long-pressed the bookmark so as to remove it, I wasn't able to. All in all, it's truly a wonderful study tool, and it's been great being able to read all the publications independently. Thank you very much for all you do. Sending much love! | Repairs have been effective. I no longer experience crashes when creating notes.\nThanks for not giving up! | I‚Äôve used this app since it‚Äôs beginning, and I can honestly say it has truly been a blessing. I have it on every one of my devices.! LOVE IT! | I am truly moved to express my profound gratitude for the JW Library app, which I wholeheartedly consider a gift from Jehovah. It‚Äôs not just an app; it‚Äôs a testament to the hard work, dedication, and loving kindness that reflect our Heavenly Father Jehovah God‚Äôs qualities. The developers have poured their hearts and souls (bodies) into creating a platform that not only enriches our spiritual lives but also brings us closer to Jehovah, and for that, I am immensely grateful.\n\nThe JW Library app is an astonishing repository of spiritual nourishment. The video library offers a wide array of spiritually uplifting content, while the music library provides beautiful, harmonious tunes that touch the heart deeply. It‚Äôs evident that continuous updates are a priority, ensuring that the app remains relevant and increasingly valuable to its users. The notes feature is incredibly handy for personal study or during meetings and conventions, allowing users to jot down important spiritual gems.\n\nI‚Äôm particularly impressed by the thoughtful inclusion of sections catered to different age groups, ensuring that everyone, from our precious little ones to our respected elderly, finds content that resonates with them. Moreover, the app provides an extremely large amount of Bible translations and literature in many languages, making the truth accessible to people worldwide in their mother tongue‚Äîa truly commendable feat.\n\nWhile the app is undeniably exceptional, I have a few humble suggestions that could enhance its usability even further. It would be beneficial to make Bible translations, such as Reyna Valera and others, more widely available for languages like Spanish. Allowing for songs to be played in other music apps could also enrich the user experience, giving us the flexibility to listen to our beloved Kingdom melodies through our preferred platforms. Additionally, making the video resolution available in 1080p and 4k would significantly improve the viewing experience for all users. Lastly, enabling searches in the Library by word and having the results show in topics, just like on the online library, would greatly facilitate study and research within the app.\n\nIn closing, I want to express my deepest appreciation for the constant improvements and the unparalleled quality of the JW Library app. The developers‚Äô efforts truly make a difference in our lives, drawing us closer to Jehovah and aiding us in our spiritual journey. Thank you for this invaluable resource that continues to bless our lives richly.\n\nMay Jehovah bless your continued efforts in enhancing this wonderful tool for his praise and our spiritual nourishment.\n\nWarm Christian Love. | Every time I try to play the songs from JW library on zoom it starts to play. Then on the second or third song it just stops and I have to go in the app and press play again. And it does it every time I press play one or two songs then it stops. | Like literally.. the best app to ever exist in the whole world, I‚Äôm not kidding üòç | Thank you for your hard work and dedication to providing the organization with the most important application to excess our teaching tools and materials in order to help students of Gods word to learn about our Grand Creator.\nI hope that maybe in the future there could be a underline feature added to the task bar for preparing our lessons. | Don‚Äôt ask the App Store in your comment. Go to one of your brothers or sisters who are well versed in technology, they will be able to address your concerns and help walk you through the issue you are having. As a review, this is my favorite app and I use it more than any other app. I love that I can backup my personal study notes and keep all of my devices up to date with the latest discoveries I find in regards to the Bible.

I don‚Äôt know if this an Apple issue or a cliche in the JW App. Also the app continues to crash when adding notes. One of the problems I noticed when it crashes is when there‚Äôs a new publication, video or an updated publication is added, it causes the JW App to crash and closes out. | I am really enioying the Jw Library app and the many features and languages available are too great!

Al√©m disso, me permite compartilhar v√≠deos da organiza√ß√£o com meus estudantes. Estou muito grato por isso.‚Äù | I love this app | Love to see that jw.org has already innovative and made itself available with the new technology.\n\nSis Chandra Hardison from the Lovejoy congregation , in Hampton, Georgia ! ‚ù§Ô∏è | Good evening brothers and sisters, I have a small suggestion for Jw library. Please add more bookmarks for scriptures, the Max is ten ,I need at least 100 honestly so I can save the key scriptures, it would help so much in the ministry and informal witnessing to be able to save the numerous scriptures that apply in different situations. \nThank you so much for your time. | When I had an iPhone 6 Plus, I could turn my phone on landscape mode and click on a scripture and it would appears alongside the article I was studying. Now with the iPhone XR, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 13 Mini, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, when I click a scripture, it opens a whole new window. Now when I want to return to the information, I have to click the arrow back, instead of seeing the information side by side with the texts. I miss that feature on the phone, as it was so much easier to study and comment at meetings when I could have the scripture and information side by side. | Brothers , appreciate this wonderful tool and all the hard work that is done to make it available to all of us. Thanks to Jehovah for this amazing blessing!‚Ä¶ I will like to know, why If I study on my phone, theres no continuity on my Ipad?‚Ä¶ Maybe I don‚Äôt know how to do it. But I mostly studied on my phone and use my Ipad during meetings, but then what I studied is not reflected on my Ipad.  Is there an a way to make that happen?üòè‚Ä¶ Thanks! | I use this everyday and I am so thankful to have this tool making spiritual food available 24/7.\nOnly suggestion I have is to be able to sync jw app from my iPhone with my iPad. I use either or depending on the circumstances and would like to have the ability to switch whenever necessary and have my notes on either one.\nThank you again for all the hard work. | trying to use notes is super buggy, and sometimes a portion of my notes will just disappear? And then come back once I exit out and open it again. Affected me when I tried to answer once and half of my notes was gone so I choked. Needs fixing | Fun app to have on my devices.

I love it so much! | Lo recomiendo, me gusta todo lo vers√°til que resulta! | Is amazing app | Only down side is that I needed to add a big amount of pictures and there were not many options for 12 pics or more | I used to be able to use videos in the app, now there isn‚Äôt this option anymore, I only got the app for the videos | Allows for me to show off several photos without having a slide per photo. Plus it allows me to explore my creative side with how you can arrange and customize everything. | <333 | Creatively squeeze in more pics in less slides! Love it!! | I said what I said | Definitely recommend for anyone on Instagram wanting to share more photos | i always find myself wanting to layer pictures with videos on scroll and stories, i wish that the premium version was cheaper but i do understand. Maybe a month to month subscription option added | Great app! | It could be more malleable. I feel restricted not being able to rotate pictures or effects. A gradient overlay option would be nice to make multiple photos feel cohesive. | easy and great for collages | Great templates, app runs well | I love the templates & how easy it is to be creative on your own or adding on to the template. I‚Äôve had so much fun using this app! | asks for review everyg*damntime\nbut it works so here ya goo | Excellent | Is this a scam?! | Love it! | For sure the app feels fleshed out. They do try to get you to pay for the premium in clever ways in the beginning when you choose templates but it did exactly what I wanted to do and do a simple collage for my insta story. | Love it, still learning how to use it! I wish we could add background color to text boxes. üëçüèª | If I could I would give this app zero stars. I am so frustrated with this app. Nothing within the app works and if I get started it immediately crashes. I have contacted Apple and they could not help me. Oddly, it worked fine before I purchased it. Now I‚Äôm out a considerable amount of money because I paid for an entire year. | This makes posting my photos unique and able to post a lot at once without feeling like I‚Äôm posting so much! No endless scrolling! | would be happy to have more styles and effects | I think this app really helps elevate my social media | w app | great app | Idk what‚Äôs wrong with this app - but after paying the $40 premium fee to unlock the features I find that I can‚Äôt even upload the pictures I want into the frames why would we pay for an app we can‚Äôt use? | fire, works perfectly | So far so good. I‚Äôll update when I make a post | Great for posting clients photos | Pretty simple to use and some good features one on the free version. May upgrade in the future | Hasta el momento excelente | SCRL allows me to make unique IG content which I enjoy. App is Very user friendly. | Love this app | Best composition app, I use it all the time no cap! | So easy to use and great quality of app!! | This has made this my business run so smoothly and makes posting on Instagram so easy! | Great. Love it and use it frequently\nFor my design posts. | I found this app at a very critical point in my life, where I‚Äôve rediscovered how to experiment with my social media to draw out what thoughts and actions lead to better outcomes.

It‚Äôs easy to learn. A must have for removing backgrounds, masking, fixing/changing almost anything in all types of imagery, and the list goes on and on. Super awesome for fixing and changing selfies and photos of friends, etc. super great stickers and lots of them! If you can imagine it this app will more than likely be able to help you manifest it.

It crashes over and over ! Waste product\n\nGot update that the IT team has been alerted and app has been fixed . Restored the app and tried again . The app crashed over again and again . | It‚Äôs the best working my app and now myStorage will be not full it‚Äôs the best app so far \nThanks for the app. | Slow, ineffective, fails to do what it‚Äôs made for. There‚Äôs all too many free apps who do a way better job. | It was pretty good | I‚Äôd appreciate a developer‚Äôs response to all of the reports of the app crashing. Hellloooooo? | I thought this app was gonna be helpful, however it was not. For example, whenever I try to use the smart clean feature it doesn‚Äôt let me without making me buy one of the passes! This is terrible for anyone who just wants to clean out their storage for FREE! I don‚Äôt feel that you should be charging to deep clean somebody‚Äôs phone! I get if it was a house that was extremely dirty! That is just flipping INSANE!!! | The program cleared events off a calendar I don‚Äôt even use and only 285 sup pics of some 11,000.

Never worked.  Was so excited to use it, too! | So far so good | It does what is supposed to do | Interface looks nice and intent makes sense but if you cannot access the application and get two steps into the process of using prior to the app crashing; it is just a pretty app with no function. | While I like the app, the way it was advertised can best summed up as false advertising; it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúFree‚Ä¶‚Äù\nIt was able to clean my phone (Accordingly) in mere seconds, the prompts were easy to follow, with choices for whomever‚Ä¶\nPersonally, there‚Äôs no need for me to pay each week to clean my phone, therefore I‚Äôll pass/unsubscribe from that‚Ä¶it‚Äôs great for a one time clean‚Ä¶ | ùìîùîÅùì¨ùì≤ùìΩùìÆùì≠ ùìΩùì∏ ùìµùìÆùì™ùìªùì∑ ùì∂ùì∏ùìªùìÆ | Awesome üòé thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è | Hi I‚Äôm 10 and I do not like paying for apps and I can‚Äôt do anything without spending money on it so if it was free I think I would work well but I just don‚Äôt want to pay it and my storage is full and I don‚Äôt know what to do so if it was free then ok but this iPad is not connected to and credit card so I can‚Äôt pay and I don‚Äôt have PayPal plus I don‚Äôt have a number for PayPal so if you could just make the clean out my storage for free that would be awesome thank you.üò© | Scam. Crashes repeatedly and no refunds. | Would be great if it worked. | Yes | Did clean up so much, just unwilling to delete pics. Thanks | This app is not worth the time it takes to download it. Only crashes. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money. Do better thank you the only silver lining is \nOnly $.29 to try. | Easiest and fastest way to clear space! | Ai is pretty cool | Great job | Have not been able to cancel my trial subscription that will automatically renew. Very frustrating! | App opens but when selecting a function it simply stops working and closes! | Keeps kicking me out of the app and doesn‚Äôt clean the phone up at all! \n\nDo not purchase | So far so Good | This is a good app that can help and save time to clean all those pic or screen shots that we forget any it takes  a lot space . | It only cleaned up 1% on my phone, and being charged $35.00.  I do not fell it was worth what I was charged! | I have not even tried to use this yet, but I went through the reviews and it is obvious to see that the people who made this make simple, one sentence five star ratings to try a cover up all of the horrible ratings. As far as I can tell, this is a scam and doesn‚Äôt even work‚Ä¶ DO NOT BUY | Awesome | Just downloaded this new app. So far so good. Hope I it stays good. | sincerely hope this's one is true very awesome project cleaner indeed | It won‚Äôt stay open long enough I‚Äôm glad it didnt cost a lot of money but I want what little I dod pay back. | When it doesn‚Äôt  work you are out your money‚Ä¶ as there are no refunds at all‚Ä¶ it is not worth the cost unless you have money to burn! I tend to stay away from software that the writer doesn‚Äôt even have enough faith in to stand behind their own products enough to offer refunds.\n \nIn my opinion any software you try and removes almost nothing you don‚Äôt already do on a regular basis with free software is not worth anything. But just trying this and evidently you have lost your money.\n\nI will grant that the product did remove a very few items that it promised to, but it certainly isn‚Äôt worth anything as a paid ap.\n\nMany are as good or better and if they even stand behind their product, it makes it the better choice. | Waste of money, EVERYTIME I open the app it shuts right down , it literally won‚Äôt let me do anything inside the app. | great app | Wish you were here enjoying the speedy internet | Basically scammed me | THIS IS WHY ITS SO AWESOME!

They should at least make the group like 12 or plus but a four-year-old should not have this app not at all that‚Äôs just wrong and they should not be doing this. and also for the Taylor Swift thing the filter was called beauty like is Taylor Swift not beautiful she not because that‚Äôs just rude pointing out like beautiful people and saying they‚Äôre not pretty they should wear make up and stuff like that that‚Äôs just not right. I think they should be doing this because it can literally destroy self love and like I don‚Äôt wanna wear make up I look so good without it seeing that ad and thinking never mind. I probably need make up. | Need a bit upgrade but cool | Every month they try to make you pay again ! I have to always go through my bank to get refund because i already paid ! Horrible looking for a new edit now | When I did the face shape it said I needed to buy pro and when I used the eraser it said I needed pro. I thought everything on the app was free there are only 3 free makeup styles and I only liked one. There is no selection like I can‚Äôt do anything. The app is only good if u buy pro. | Good | You can‚Äôt even save pictures without pro abd there are only three free filters | Good | I absolutely love this app! I pay for the membership and use it to edit videos. However, about a month ago, the app stopped working; it stopped applying filters to videos more than 30 seconds long.\n\nI have contacted customer service through their support link within the app 11 TIMES ü§Øü§Øü§Ø in the last month with absolutely no reply.\nThe app is great. As long as you don‚Äôt need any support, that‚Äôs where the nightmare begins. | i got the app because i wanted to try on the filters and when i got the app i thought some filters were gonna be free but no. | I downloaded Persona and paid.  But, is it really just for females?  Why aren‚Äôt there male filters?   Shouldn‚Äôt you let peeps know before they download that it is only for females? | You removed the Belle filter. Bring it back please! | Nothing in this app is free. Even those that allow you to try won‚Äôt let you save without subscription then what‚Äôs the point? | I try to stay away from doing much photo editing; it‚Äôs easy to get carried away with it and end up with beautiful photos that look nothing like yourself. Having no pores is tempting to apply to selfies but it‚Äôs not realistic and can cause dysmorphia. So, I don‚Äôt use this app for doing huge changes but it‚Äôs great for quick and easy touch ups; smoothing hair, enhancing makeup, correcting shadows and lighting issues. I have been tempted to buy the permanent one payment option for this app but haven‚Äôt been able to justify it yet but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll happen in the near future. | Omg I don‚Äôt expect that but anyway is very nice thank you so much | –†–∞–Ω—å—à–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–æ—Å—å –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ, —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–æ–≥ FaceApp, –±—ã–ª–∏ –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω—ã –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Ñ–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤\n–°–µ–π—á–∞—Å –∂–µ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∏ –ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∞–±—Å–æ–ª—é—Ç–Ω–æ –≤—Å–µ —Ñ–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä—ã!\n–í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—á–∏–∫–∞–º, —á–µ–≥–æ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ–∫—É–ø–∞—Ç—å?? | This showed up on my screen as a free download app but when I went into the app this thing popped up on the screen telling me I had to choose a subscription for the app and it also would not let me save my photos with the filters on | Recently so many options aren‚Äôt working anymore \nEven it didn‚Äôt recognize your face for video editing \nSpecifically if there is 2 faces on the video \nIt‚Äôs so useful now | Not really you. It‚Äôs just an illusion why would you want to look like someone that‚Äôs not really you! Fake deceiving people. You don‚Äôt look like that it‚Äôs just filter. | Love this app | You have to pay to do freaking anything! Like this is frustrating. üò≠üò≠ü•∫ idk | Wont give u free 3 days | Great app for photos. | Like literally every filter literally looks like trash and I don‚Äôt like it like let people try it without paying at least for one week pls bro it‚Äôs not worth it to get this if u don‚Äôt want to pay because if u don‚Äôt pay it is the worst thing ever so don‚Äôt get it | I've installed this app about six days ago, It work's amazing but almost everything cost premium, which isn't a problem but I did find it quite annoying. | LIKE WOW !!!!!!!!!!

I‚Äôve been using Microsoft products on a PC for as long as I can remember.  Word was what I learned originally.  I just want to be able to update documents created on my PC but this just feels like a crippled version.  I have a keyboard on my iPad so I would expect it to be really similar, but formatting was lost from the original and context menus aren‚Äôt the same.  I can‚Äôt figure out how to do some things.  Even text selection seems sketchy, not always showing a cursor where I tap.  If you just want to type plain text in paragraphs it‚Äôs probably fine, but I‚Äôm going back to my PC.  This is good for proof reading but that‚Äôs about it. | The only problem with this app is that sometimes it tries correcting the sentences that are correct, but other than that, the app is great! | I‚Äôd like to say that I absolutely love this app.  It is the easiest, fun app that I‚Äôve ever worked with.  I create letters, stories etc. with the greatest of ease. | It‚Äôs alright, it‚Äôs functional at best but for some reason, instead of getting a fully functional word, we get this hacked up app that‚Äôs been twisted and torn. \n\nAnd for some reason they changed the way tables are made.

You have to login every time. Always trying to get to sign up for another account. We already have two. | I WRITE ALL OF MY STORYSBHERE! NO ADS AT ALL! LOVE IT! | This will crash consistently if you‚Äôre using it on an ipad. Working in between files is not functional with this app on the ipad. The app will crash over and over when working in between word files. Not recommended. Wish I didn‚Äôt have to use this app for work files. | Me gustaba cuando era gratis | Thanks for updating | Word App feels a little difficult to navigate during my write in while I elaborate to research so | Not user friendly!!!! | Fabulous | I exploded | Everyone in the world knows Microsoft word, it‚Äôs been around since as long as I can remember using a computer in grade school, it has come a long way, well I learned more of what it offers anyways, when I think internet, computers, phones, typing anything, my lists, organizing documents, creating, just about anything I would need done I can link it to Microsoft being able to make it happen. Word is a great app because it offers all the different apps organized into one, now I don‚Äôt like having extra apps on my phone an maybe I just haven't learned how to do this but even though I use word it seems when I need those apps I still have to have them come up so in a way it‚Äôs great to organize them but I wish I could fully access everything on those apps threw word but that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs made for so this is a useless complaint keep up the amazing work I expect to see you around when my grandchildren‚Äôs children are using devices. | Each time i am working on my lesson plans and adjusting it according to my professor, it does not save even though i am saving it each and every time.

For example if I want to edit a specific sentence I will put the cursor in that specific place and begin typing. Randomly I will be typing 2-3 sentences ahead of where I want to edit.  By the time I realize it, I have to then edit both sentences.  Very aggravating | Google is a smoother experience.

It‚Äôs really wonderful | If | Use it constantly online for purchases. Gives me peace of mind and valuable protection. | You charge my tree time for the same item Put many back\n\nDon‚Äôt pay to style until you will be shire the order is presant\n2,5 months I‚Äôm waiting for my order and they asking me order is not  prepared \n Shame on  company !!! \nThey using my many dollar but no order??\nWhy they not informing me about absent of the order or why they advertised in site?? | My husband and I have been searching and researching for an app to utilize to help save for different things ‚Äî Christmas, birthdays, trips, emergency fund, etc. We began using the ‚ÄúSet Goals‚Äù savings‚Äô feature, and when I tell you we are blown away!! We have several goals setup, and are able to move funds with ease weekly, bi-weekly, etc., depending on the goal. The one thing we like is ‚Äúout of sight‚Ä¶out of mind‚Äù once we move it from our main account. The mindset is move it because that money is already accounted for. I‚Äôm just so excited we found an app that allows us to save, budget, and be financially stable for goals. | I never do this but something has to be done they restrict ur account and take ur money saying that u violated the terms they are truly a fraud!!! | This was a good account for me for 17 years but they seem to let scammers take over the accounts if you don‚Äôt watch out. PayPal not that good to keep money on it you will lose money.I lost a couple of $1000. Because they share your data and information. | Bueno | I have appreciated and enjoyed using the platform of PayPal. It‚Äôs a great app! However PayPal Credit‚Äôs portion of the app with Synchrony could use improvement. I have been managing our financing payments and have gotten the run around with PayPal credit/Synchrony. They insist that we have to call the same day a payment is made to ask for it to be allocated - if you have different financing you‚Äôre paying off. I pay over the required minimum each month so that the extra would go to where it needs to go prior to the financing offer‚Äôs expiration. I made my monthly payment a few days ago and decided to proceed with paying off my 6 month financing offers just to be done with it. I am told that I can‚Äôt do that until I make the minimum payment on my easy financing option - which isn‚Äôt due until next month. Please make an allocation option for payments on PayPal credit, after the minimum amount has been met. In this day and age, we shouldn‚Äôt have to call customer service for 20-30 minutes just to make sure our payments go to the right places! | A mi familia y a m√≠ nos fascina comprar casi todo por aqu√≠ en PayPal | With the worst exchange rate in the market and forcing you to exchange the money to your local currency, they are basically STEALING from you to keep their terrible business running.\nHopefully they go bankrupt soon and close their scam store. | rt | PayPal is one of the best companies in the world especially if you‚Äôre conducting business they will be there for you if you have an issue with a seller not being honest or even help find a solution I highly recommend this application thank you PayPal I really wanna try there credit card also hopefully they approve me their the best | I have been permanently limited on what I can do and I can‚Äôt undo it. This app won‚Äôt let me take my bank account off or delete my account. | Their customer services are totally scum. You look for support but instead you‚Äôll get busted by them. The manager stephanie is one.\nDon‚Äôt read paid reviews but those experiences it. \nStay away from PayPal if your money is worth. | See title | lol | It allows the user direct access into the app without using biometrics when the Paypal password is saved in iPhone‚Äôs password manager, even when the user has biometrics turned on! This is ok when the user is logging into Paypal for the first time on their phone using saved password, but Paypal biometrics should pop up and be required every time thereafter because the user has elected biometrics for extra security. Thank-you! | This app is absolute garbage | Always provides excellent service. | I‚Äôve had a PayPal account for years, but hardly use is. Someone paid me recently and accidentally noted the transaction is for a good sold. PayPal have made it a complete pain to get my money. They are trying to withhold money for taxes (and this is not a tax event), get information about my inventory (which I don‚Äôt have since I‚Äôm an individual), and ultimately are making it incredibly difficult to get  MY money. Plus they take crazy fees. So many better services out there, and truly will never use PayPal after I get my money from them. | Excelente servicio y muy buena atenci√≥n | Yo recomiendo que lo usen tengo varios a√±os  y estoy contento | My PayPal application has refused to download | Been using PayPal for about 8 years now and it‚Äôs Awesome! Very convenient and an excellent way to pay for purchases instantly. | BUYERS, SELLERS BEWARE! DO NOT USE THIS APP OR ANY APP AFFILIATED WITH PAYPAL. IF YOU RECEIVE MONEY THEY WILL FREEZE YOUR ACCOUNT AND PLACE A HOLD ON YOUR MONEY FOR 21 DAYS!! THERE IS NO WAY AROUND THIS THEY SAY AND IS COMMON BUSINESS PRACTICE. THEY ALSO ARE RAN BY AN ANTISEMITIC GROUP AND I HAVE PROOF | I love using Pay pal and any card related to  PayPal this card is so easy to use and available anywhere at anytime. I love using it thank you | May scam happened through my account and when it comes to paypal they are not responsible for it. Most recent scam happened when one of my fans decided to make a donation in my accounts paypal will hold their money for more than a week to review and paypal claims we don‚Äôt use the moneyü§£ | please hire swift‚Ä¶ the app dont remember details and i have to add code everytime. | They absolutely not protect from the scammers!! And close customer service cases without reason!!\nAvoid this service, keep your money save | The app is not designed for the iPad which makes the use of it annoying    I can use it on he ipad but it stays with it‚Äôs iPhone design. Please make it compatible to the ipad. | I have had good experiences with PayPal. Easy to use, with no problems. | All good | It‚Äôs always greater when I need it. | They banned a group of gays from their platform awhile the allowance of Prostasia which is a pro-pedophilia organization. It seems Paypal hates children and wishes them to be sexually abused. And apparently they also share information with FBI on only people who make Conservative purchases without a warrant, probable cause, or any regard for constitutional protections. | I‚Äôm enjoying using PayPal it is covenient and easy to use | I have been using PayPal for long time, doing so many transactions. The first problem that I have had, even I had all the proof that I received an item damaged, I lost the case! I didn‚Äôt get any support from PayPal! I‚Äôll cancel my account and never get it again! | Very helpful and easy to use. | The app will freeze up frequently on my iPhone 15 Pro Max. I‚Äôve had to reinstall it too many times. Just not reliable. | The best and secure app for receive and send money. I really appreciate!! | I only use paypay for purchases. | Paypal is the best app of it‚Äôs kind when it works, but this latest version is very buggy. Profile page does not always load, can not scroll to bottom of page if text size on phone set to BIG, can not send cents instead rounds up to nearest whole dollar. Sent 5$ to my girlfriend to show her how PayPal works and account was blocked until she could justify where the money came from‚Ä¶ for five bucks. Terrible. | I can‚Äôt receive money on the app since the entire app just freezes. | Es genial excelente la recomiendo mucho | I have used PayPal for at least 5 years and have never had a single problem or issue of any kind. | I use PayPal because they tell you that they will cover loss when you are scammed by an online purchase. I can‚Äôt even get anyone to talk to me. They denied my claim without explanation. I‚Äôm not impressed. | Es una manera s√∫per segura de hacer pagos 100% recomendados porque adem√°s te da facilidades para pagar sin intereses | It‚Äôs been really good for me and safe \nI don‚Äôt see random charges as I did when I had cash app. It lets me know all transactions right away and it‚Äôs easy to send money to anyone.

I‚Äôve used it for years but now I‚Äôm over having to close out several tabs promoting the pro version every time I open the app | I know it‚Äôs necessary for apps to have subscriptions to make money, but the amount of content that is behind a paywall is ridiculous, especially commonly asked or helpful information. Waste of money, do not get the subscription. | –Ω–∞—à–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ —Å –≤–æ–Ω—é—á–∏–º–∏ –≥–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞–º–∏ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –±—ã—Ç—å —É—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–µ–Ω—ã | Beware!! You may not be able to cancel your trial if you don‚Äôt like the app. I decided after about 3 weeks that the app just wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for. I went into my App Subscriptions to cancel and it wasn‚Äôt there. I read the FAQ in the app to figure out how to cancel and then I went to the website. There‚Äôs no option there for me to cancel either. I thought maybe since it wasn‚Äôt an option to cancel that I wouldn‚Äôt be charged. WRONG. After the 30 day trial I received a text from bank asking if I was wanting this charge to go through, I said no. I began emailing customer support to ask them how to cancel and the gave me the same instructions that were in the FAQ. I have emailed screenshots showing that there‚Äôs no way for me to cancel and begging them to stop trying to charge my debit card. They won‚Äôt even respond to an email now. They continue to attempt to charge my card. I have had to get a new card with a new number and that itself has been time consuming. I try to remain hopeful that one day some very nice person will respond to my email with a helpful response. | i started spotting on the 11th of this month i was spotting for three days i logged from the 11th as my period starting and that‚Äôs not what it is because my period is very heavy and lasts for six to seven days but i just realized that spotting ain‚Äôt a period it can be if it gets heavier but that‚Äôs not what it is so i logged the 11th as the start of my period and it wasn‚Äôt so i just went back and unclogged the 11th through the 13th as my period and now it says i‚Äôm one day late but really my period is three days late‚Ä¶ i went back and logged those days as just spotting and it should say i‚Äôm three days late not one please fix?! | Its been about two weeks since ive tried to reach customer service an bout my subscription and failed to contact a real person. I just kept getting automated emails. I like this app to track my cycle and nothing else, the subscription they offer does not help me. *UPDATE* They responded and told me to contact them and then didnt reach out to help fix my problem after I emailed AGAIN‚Ä¶ why is the customer service so terrible??? | I just got me period and I needed to know when I was going to end it and start it again after I‚Äôm done with this week! I really love this app bc it tells me when/around the time im going to be ending it or starting it again! You are probably reading this To know if you want to download this app or not !? I rate it a 5/5 I LOVE IT!!! And I hope you do/will too | P√©sima aplicaci√≥n y costosa | You have to pay for everything on this app | I‚Äôve had this app for years and it was great. Now everytime you go to get on they are advertising way too much. They use to give insightful information now they want you to pay to be able to view it and are constantly adverting it using pop ups that you can‚Äôt really click out of. Liked the older version better. | The app is ok. Nothing extraordinary. You are able to track you period, weight and symptoms. You can also track water intake, however, this feature has a glitch. It resets to 12oz every time, which makes it impossible to use. \nI have tried reaching out customer support, twice by email, and on each social media platform and no response which makes me wonder what kind of customer support do they offer.\nFor being an app it‚Äôs expensive, and I‚Äôm starting to think it is absolutely not worth it. | The constant pushing to buy the premium service is obnoxious. Every minute I'll get a popup saying that I can get premium for some sale amount that changes every time. I'm about to find a different app to track my pregnancy. | hiiii so i have premium but i still don‚Äôt have the partner connecting thing..? i‚Äôve tried updating it and deleting it but it just wont show up What do i do??? I want to have my bf to have it why isn‚Äôt it showing up | I used to have a-lot of trouble tracking my period but this app makes it so much easier! The tips it gives are also very helpful and my female health has been much more organized. | I downloaded this app and paid for the premium plan for my wife and I. Unfortunately, I paid for the premium version on my phone and not my wife‚Äôs phone. I reached out to customer support multiple times with how to get it switched to her phone. All I got in response via email were AI or template responses. There is no customer support number I have been able to find and good luck getting a hold of a real person. I like the app but I‚Äôm so disappointed and frustrated that I just want my money back so we can pay for premium on my wife‚Äôs phone. | I got flo to try and help me track my period and body while ttc. There was a $1 three month free period. I cancelled it well before and now every week I see they are trying to charge me for another month. Customer service gives me generic directions that I‚Äôve already followed. I‚Äôve even showed them screenshots of how I‚Äôve already cancelled and deleted my app. I‚Äôm telling all my friends to NEVER download this app. They have been trying to charge me so much. I‚Äôm so over it. | I gave Flo a try because of the offer they had for a one year package. I did my part in tracking and documenting every part of my whole cycle. It was always inaccurate. I have normal periods, every now and then I experience an occasional off period, but Flo just did flow with my flow. I will finish the trial, then end it. I do a more accurate job tracking myself, though I'm sure there is someone out there who does fine this app resourceful. | The partner extension really helps me understand my woman yeah she bad and everything so it‚Äôs hard not to have sexual interaction with her all the time but me being able to see when the chances of pregnancy are higher so it‚Äôs like beneficial for me and her so we don‚Äôt start spiting out like creatures but i love the app | It‚Äôs good to track your period but anything else you have to pay for. Disappointing. And the baiting is just infuriating. You think I might have PCOS? Let‚Äôs check these symptoms you‚Äôve been having but first, pay. I understand the articles being behind the paywall, but baiting on a woman‚Äôs fears is just a straight up Ahole move.\n\nRead and listen to the most recent reviews Flo. Your audience is p!ssed off about everything being behind a paywall/needs a subscription! Yea yea, you gotta put stuff for a subscription to improve but, how are we supposed to want to pay if you don‚Äôt give us a bite about anything that we might be paying for?? And I‚Äôve said it once and I‚Äôll say it again, baiting on women‚Äôs fears (‚Äòyou may have PCOS, gotta pay to find out‚Äô) is one of the lowest moves you can pull. No stars. | Edit: It took 17 attempts to finally reach a human. I received a satisfactory answer from Sophie at Flo support. A few weeks later I received a developer response which I just replied to. We‚Äôll see how that goes. All I‚Äôm trying to do is point out a fairly significant bug in their user experience. (Well, 2 bugs, considering it took 17 attempts to reach a person in support). \n\nOriginal:\nTheir customer service is atrocious. It‚Äôs just a bot that replies with a boilerplate response. I‚Äôm on 14 attempts to get the issue with their app resolved and I receive the same A.I. generated response as the original support ticket. Skip this app and find another that actually gives a care about you. This isn‚Äôt the app for you. | I used to LOVE Flo because I was able to track so many different things and take quizzes and keep track of so much‚Ä¶ however, now any and everything useful on the app makes you pay for premium and it‚Äôs not worth it. I‚Äôll be deleting the app because there‚Äôs hardly anything at all you can do for free, it‚Äôs ridiculous. | I overall like the app. It gives a lot of information and helps a lot. The only thing I really struggled with is finding the partner code. I still can‚Äôt find it. | I‚Äôve used this app for many years both free and premium and never had an issue, but lately opening the app to get bombarding with non skippable pop ups asking me to go premium (several pop ups one after the other!!) has been ruining my experience. I rarely open the app anymore other than to check my cycle dates due to these pop ups. Please at least minimize the pop ups, there‚Äôs no excuse to be bombarded with 3+ ads in a row that I CANNOT easily exit out of. I‚Äôve paid for the premium feature before and realized I was not missing out on anything. So if I wanted to go premium again I would‚Äôve already, stop pressuring! | I‚Äôve tried to reach customer support several times about an issue I‚Äôm having regarding the tracking calendar and I keep getting the same canned response about Flo Partners? My question has nothing to do with Flo Partners & no matter what I respond back with or submit a new inquiry, it‚Äôs the same email about Flo Partners. I pay for this app but if I can‚Äôt even get genuine customer support, I‚Äôm not sure that this is worth it for me. | Flo for partners is kind of terrible. I shared with my husband so we can both have access to articles and watch baby‚Äôs weekly progress but he has access to nearly nothing! He gets 6 ‚Äúarticles‚Äù that are about a paragraph each. We both pay for premium! He only gets about 10% of the content I have access to, and there‚Äôs no way to allow him to see more. Flo doesn‚Äôt care about the fathers apparently? | This app goes ABOVE AND BEYOND to give you the best results possible so that you can hopefully fulfill your goals weather it be just tracking your ovulation and period or if it‚Äôs to actually get those two beautiful lines on your test!! FLO app is the WAY to go!!! 10 stars the only problem is I wish it was free. But it is what it is. | I love the app but I‚Äôm experiencing trouble deleting information I logged incorrectly. I‚Äôm trying to contact support for a few days but still no response. | This app will delete any comment that you mentioned the word God in. even if you are replying to another believer. yet in their guidelines, they say that they don‚Äôt allow homophobic or transphobic, etc. but apparently it‚Äôs OK to be hateful towards Christians. *** DELETED ASAP*** | the only thing i dont like is that almost every single thing is locked behind a membership.. for 15 dollars a month?? its absolutely insane. | I have been using this app since 2018 and used to really enjoy it, but I‚Äôm getting frustrated with the push for a premium subscription. I had one for a while and it just wasn‚Äôt worth the money. I wouldn‚Äôt mind there being an ad if it was easy and quick to click out of. Might be switching to another app soon if that doesn‚Äôt improve. | This app always freezes, often multiple times in a row, when I‚Äôm trying to input information so I have to shut it down and re-open it. It also doesn‚Äôt seem to pick up on patterns of user input data. I have the same symptoms during ovulation and PMS but it never suggests those in the quick add. My periods are always 6-7 days but it always guesstimates it at 3-4 days. WHY. | I need the partner tab and I don‚Äôt have it and it doesn‚Äôt need updating I‚Äôve checked so my app is weird üò≠ | Everyone was very supportive and a great way to track your period | La mejor app | I really enjoy the app but i feel like it is a little misleading, like it has all this information and contact to doctors but you have to pay an insane amount and i don‚Äôt feel like the chats and the basic info should have to be paid for, it almost feels like a scam every time i have the slightest question or want the correct information it gives me a whole chat only to build up to the answer/info i‚Äôm looking for, and only to tell me to subscribe to get them. Also all the responses to similar complaints i‚Äôve seen are just things the developers say to sound like they are not being rude with the marketing. i just don‚Äôt feel like they really value the needs of their community and are trying to profit off of women who just want to know and track their cycle effectively and efficiently. | Really used to love this app because it was one of the few period apps that would actually tell you about your symptoms. Yeah I understand they have to charge people so the app can get better but essentially they are just charging for free information thats on google. And yea whats the big deal right ‚Äújust google it‚Äù well then  it would really defeat the purpose of the app. Being charged for stuff like detailed information on symptoms and the secret chats and sex insights is understandable those things are by choice. The only thing I use the app for for free is logging my period and symptoms anything else cost. I should be able to Atleast get free period insights considering that‚Äôs what the app is for. Anyways if you were looking for a free app specifically for periods..KEEP LOOKING THIS IS NOT THE APP. But if you are willing to pay for a subscription and are actually going to use ALL of the features then go for it the app isnt bad for premium members but at this point its only geared for premium members. | My app stopped syncing with the Health app in Dec. Support told me that this feature is ‚Äúunfortunately no longer available‚Äù‚Ä¶ then why are all icons and settings for data synching with Health still remaining in the app? –Ø –ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É—é—Å—å –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º —Å 2015 –≥–æ–¥–∞, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –æ–Ω–æ –≤—ã—à–ª–æ, –∏ –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞ –µ–≥–æ —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –≤—ã—à–µ –ø–æ—Ö–≤–∞–ª. –ù–æ –≤ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–µ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è - –≤ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —É–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–∏–Ω—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º apple health - –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏ —Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –≤–∞—à–µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –∑–∞–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ —É—Ö—É–¥—à–∏–ª–∏—Å—å. | It‚Äôs stupid when you have to pay to learn about your body. If you are wanting more people to use this app, get rid of premium because people want an app that will help them to learn and provide the information they need without paying. | love this app alot but wish the prices of the premium wasn‚Äôt as much. this app has great tips & insight on things a woman needs to kno | I‚Äôve used flo to track my cycle for many years. It‚Äôs been great for the most part but recently the pushy pop ups to ‚Äúgo premium‚Äù are extremely frustrating. I don‚Äôt want to pay money, I just simply want to continue to track my period and cycles. Please please STOP spamming users trying to get them to upgrade. The option is there, if people want it they can get it! For those of us that don‚Äôt want it, so be it.  There is zero need to continuously spam us as soon as we open the app. Besides that it‚Äôs good for tracking and such. | I used to love Flo, but now it‚Äôs been over a month that the app simply doesn‚Äôt work. What a shame | My partner can‚Äôt see the different date updates. | I love this app so much today was my first period,I really understand how my cycle works and I feel so free to speak to people about my period as the people on here are so kind and supportive and they give me so many tips for my period I love it. | To be totally honest, MAKE IT FREEEEEEE!!!! I‚Äôm 13 and broke, ur girl needs to know certain things without paying. The only thing that is free is the period tracker the rest is basically about health and safety which I‚Äôm all for, but pls make it free | Why is everything behind a subscription????? I hate it üëéüëéüëé the only thing i can look at is the calendar but i gotta pay for everything else | I‚Äôve tried emailing them so many times. I heard back once and then never again. The 1-800 doesn‚Äôt even work! I got charged twice for premium and they won‚Äôt give me a refund. | I am completely blind, and would love to use this app for period tracking. However, it does not work very well with Apple VoiceOver at all. It frequently skips around, things are not read correctly, etc. Blind women get their periods too! Do better! | the period tracking is pretty accurate, but it‚Äôs becoming more of a paid platform than free for women. it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs truly trying to help women and more of a make money kinda thing. i wish i could turn off the forums because they are mostly for preteen

Very dangerous | You'll see targeted ads every 4 or so posts on your home page and then the rest will be users who paid for a blue check mark (verification) so their own content is being pushed allowing more ads in the shape of a sponsorship. | It‚Äôs nice to not have to search for shadow banned content that I should have in my feed | The first 10 replies to every tweet are either ads or spam. We would like to see human responses / comments. | Bots and unrelated comments in posts | Ever since Elon bought this app all I‚Äôve seen is racism and stupid conspiracy theories on my feed. It‚Äôs nothing but trolls and misinformation now. | Although twitter manifested into X you still gotta bite your tounge without VIOLATING the sensitive terms of service ‚Äútos‚Äù | I only check this site out of habit, but I‚Äôm not going to do it anymore because the right wing mega people have taken it over. I already belong to Tribel and will start sticking with that site to get my information. I used to really like Twitter, but now I can‚Äôt stand it, because, it is unbelievable it might as well belong to Trump himself. The right wing has control over it. I used to like and have respect for the current owner, but now he is in the same category with all the mega people. The sharpest tools in the shed. Or as I will often say a couple of french fries short of a happy meal. | Finally some real news! | I am trying to repost/retweet a tweet. I can see that the repost/retweet button is highlighted but it never appeared on my page. I was wondering if that is because there are more bugs that need to be taken care of. I noticed that the app recently updated so I wonder if it needs to be updated again.\n\nUpdate: I was able to undo the repost and post both now it went back to not giving me the option to undo the repost/retweet. I am having issues with one tweet but other tweets give me the option to undo the repost/retweet. | Just look at the facts!  Hunter you wouldn‚Äôt give him a dime!  Shady deals lies!  Trumps putting out the truth!  Period‚Ä¶ | Really appreciate you giving us little folks a place to find the information | It‚Äôs very confusing. Those I follow are always fill with posts from people I dont | You get permanently suspended for no reason when there‚Äôs online ho.Es showing their naked body‚Äôs to anything and everyone without any consequences | Social media has become an echo chamber. People like to only surround themselves with like minded opinions, I‚Äôm grateful that this app is less censored than MetaVerse. Hoping one day the democratic countries will see the censorship that has been occurring on both sides of the political spectrum. | Elon ruined Twitter, every reply is full of bots and spam accounts. | I miss twitter üò• | So nice to have freedom to voice your opinion without being suppressed by someone who doesn‚Äôt like what I to say üòÅ | This is the only place I can freely express myself, if this is taken away then America will not be a free country. | Twitter is very fun and exciting to share and communicate with others. Thank you X | Whether I‚Äôm on data or wifi, regardless of where I am. I‚Äôve tried getting them played and they aren‚Äôt | 1.  It would be helpful to have a User‚Äôs guide.  For example, I can‚Äôt figure out how to initiate a post.  I have only been able to reply to other posts.\n2.  I can‚Äôt find community notes.  It seems it should be very accessible.  It could be easily explained in 1.\n3. Spaces for iPad.  Much more screen real estate means view much greater ease in interacting with X.\n4. Where do I access Grok?  See 1. above.\n5. An easy way to go back some amount of time, like 20 hours.\n6. Additional ways of flagging or pinning interesting content for future reference, in addition to Bookmarks.\n\nKeep up the great work. | Twitter used to be great. X is nothing but a disinformation factory. Just kill it already. It‚Äôs why Elon bought it - to kill it. Just do it already. Quit dragging it out. If you wanted Gab, you shoulda bought Gab. | You have to pay for everything. | Big fan of the new X! Elon won‚Äôt back down to the radical liberals and that‚Äôs why so many Americans like and respect him. | üëèüèºüòçüôåüèº | Would be a 5 star if I could use it on my watch! | I reposted and wanted to undo and it‚Äôs not popping the option up.

Why do we have to pay for something we hopefully don‚Äôt have to use to often. I don‚Äôt like to do business without knowing what is going on. I like to work but I don‚Äôt see the reason for this. | Why is there not way to cancel your subscription? | The application doesn‚Äôt work properly, and the developers used those forced redirect advertisements to the webpage. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they were stealing/logging your data. | Its good for awhile but always disconnect when im offline most of the time but when on it happens a few times with s notifications. That is kindah scary at times.going. Right now its an one still no connection. Going to find another app. | I've been going around trying out all sorts of vpns, this is the most highly priced and looks like it was made in the early 2000s. You're telling me it's $9 every week??? That is nearly $500 a year. That's a little outrageous. But what do I know, I've only tried about 20 VPNs so far. 3 of them being the top 3 vpns.If you're looking for good VPNs try out Nord or Express, plenty of offer codes out there to chisel down the price tag. Express is even backed by a lot of streaming services so you won't be \"proxy detected\" and kicked off the platform. | Blocks me from my bank.   Turned it off I get to the bank again | Easy to use | Nice | Very great | So is it true that there‚Äôs app‚Äôs that You can download to find certain app‚Äôs/games that IOS doesn‚Äôt have anymore? I thought this would work but I guess not. | 215. 388. 9807 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏272. 444. 0578üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ | It says that it stops website ads and viruses. In truth, it doesn‚Äôt. Even after downloading it and signing up, I still got 14 viruses on my phone in less than 2 minutes. Save your money and time. Run away now | Not impressed | I do not want your product even though I was forced to install it I want it removed and I want the spyware with it removed. I will not pay for this. | I do just got it was working you seevery fast and pretty lights I give it a whirl but it‚Äôs not really working I just got the same problem | This app is horrible and it counts down for a virus it said it can damage my phone this app is horrible please try to fix that can‚Äôt trust anyone now days | It‚Äôs worked great since I‚Äôve downloaded it ! Highly rate! | THIS APP IS NOT REQUIRED BY APPLE NO MATTER WHAT YOU CLICKED ON TO GET HERE. \n\nEdit: 10 Aug, 2023: the developer has somewhat modified their response to remove comments about not using deceptive and dark pattern advertising methods.   My warning stands: if you got here because a message on a website or app told you that you needed security software, or that apple is requiring you to install this application, it is a lie. This application is not and never will be required by apple. To the developer: just stop. You are wrong. Admit that you are using these ads and stop attempting to communicate with me by editing your response.  I got here via one of those ads and I will absolutely continue to alert people to the bogus nature of them.  \n\n Edit: 1 aug, 2023. The developer has done exactly what I said they would do: responded to my review with a statement that they don‚Äôt do the things I said they did. Fact remains: they are directing traffic to this app with bogus ‚Äúsystem messages‚Äù indicating that apple is requiring the installation of this VPN software. If you got here by way of one of those ads, it is not real, and is not required by apple. This app is one of the many, samey, useless vpn/proxy apps that aim to take your information and money under the guise of ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù and privacy‚Äù You likely got here because a website was either hacked or cyber squatted, redirecting you to a website that claims that apple is recommending you ‚Äúprotect your phone now‚Äù This is a lie, and a common scam tactic. Never download ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù apps that ‚Äúsystem‚Äù messages or scare tactics direct you to install. The ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù will claim that what I have written here is false. They are lying. I was directed here, just like you, by a hacked site redirecting to an ad sever. | PYREX | Goooood | I got this app to do what it supposed to, how come I have to pay money to use the vpn thing in MY COUNTRY they want me to spend money for that, I rather have viruses all over my phone then to pay and get them removed this is stupid | ad blocker works flawlessly | Just does its job | Thumbs up! | Loads of countries to pick from. | No stress vpn! | I was trying to watch free movies cuase I was bored and then it said ‚Äúvirus activating in phone in _‚Äù and then started counting down and so then it took me here and was like ‚Äúget this FREE app‚Äù so I did and I‚Äôm kinda confused \n ( I don‚Äôt have any problems with the app I‚Äôm just genuinely confused about what is happening to my phone so please answer back people that own this thing) thank you | helped me get around those pesky access restrictions | Been using this for a while, no issues at all. | Class!!! i love you program no-brainer to use. | I‚Äôve got the app , but nothing else !!\n                 PLEASE  CANCEL  NOW  ,!! | Male | Very good | Nice | It didn‚Äôt let me connect to the app and it took it off after three days.This might seem dumb but it‚Äôs not because I invited the girl i love and it didn‚Äôt work and she left. | ????? | It is good to keep my internet search safe. | This app is fake | I downloaded this because apple was forcing me to and now I get why because all they want is money and of course the one in the United States costs money but Germany is free | I hate this app | I was on this website, and it took me to a whole different web and told me to download this stupid app(I literally forgot what it said ü•≤-but I closed the app immediately) anyways‚Ä¶ it was a HUGE mistake.

Either give me nothing at all, but don‚Äôt tease me with 10 seconds. | I‚Äôm not paying a subscription fee for a remote control. Ever. Uninstalled. | It‚Äôs not working for me. I need a refund. | ‚òπÔ∏è | Doesn‚Äôt work | My fianc√©e and I have been trying to find a good app for our LG tv. This app works best ,not only for our LG ,but our Samsung and Roku tvs as well. I would recommend if you lose a remote and need a quick fix. | Can‚Äôt even use the app for 3 days until they ask you to pay for a remote app fix it trash app I wouldn‚Äôt recommend | Obviously the goal is for you to make some kind of purchase; it allows you to connect to your tv and appears at first to work but then won‚Äôt allow you to do anything without the ‚Äúsubscribe to premium‚Äù ad screen popping up. Literally any time you try to click anything. Cheap and disappointing; not to mention all of the 5 stars reviews here are in gibberish. I‚Äôd happily pay if it seemed legitimate. | If you lost a remote, do not get this app, this app is horrible that my TV was on. It said searching for the app it did not even find the app. This app is horrible horrific and then when it did start working, I tried to press the button it did not work. This app is horrible. | I love it | Connected long enough for me to think it was worth paying for‚Ä¶hasn‚Äôt worked since! üëéüèªüëéüèª | False advertisement | The remote control works perfectly for the air TV mini device used with sling | This app is garbage. Every time I press volume down the volume goes up. So I tried mute instead and it doesn‚Äôt work. Literally the only buttons that work are pause and volume up (and volume down but it actually turns the volume up) | It won‚Äôt let me use it without paying so I‚Äôm deleting it | Wont connect to my google tv after update. Only says it cannot connect | This app did not work at all for me. Do not use it. | I just downloaded and paid the $6.99 a month just to get in to set it up and it doesn‚Äôt even connect to my tv! \nThen I go to cancel it then shows you a lot lower rates. So I try to contact them. Typed the message and there is no send button. So now I come on here and you have to rate them before you can give a review and it gives them self 5 stars and you can change it after many tries. \nThere needs to be a better option out out there. | Not even sure if it will work, they instantly ask for you to pay for a subscription | Yes | Say Toshiba but wont connect to my tv | Stop selling this garbage | Ok so I was just trying to find an app that works then I saw this an I‚Äôm like ok this could be good so I downloaded it then I went on the app I had to connect to my tv then it worked well that‚Äôs what I thought then the next day I go back on the app then it keeps on showing premium then I‚Äôm like oh no so it worked once. | If I had my remote I wouldn‚Äôt need yours. I‚Äôm unable to approve the connection on my tv. | Only app that works | p and oo | Wish I could give a zero didn‚Äôt even give an option for a free trial paid for a month and wasn‚Äôt able to use one deleting don‚Äôt use this | Wouldn‚Äôt set up or do anything | This app did pair with my Apple TV relatively easily, but could not control the selections.\nI have now deleted it. | Ok | It let me use it for 2 days & then has been trying to charge me for it in order to use it again. Do not recommend! | It worked once or twice and then it kept offering pro and wouldn‚Äôt connect | This remote works briefly, after a few seconds it cuts off. And if I try to reconnect it‚Äôll say it‚Äôs the wrong pin. Even though it isn‚Äôt | Every time I enter the code correctly it says wrong password try again | Not working | This app doesn‚Äôt work. It better give me my money back!! | App never stays connect. Takes several attempts to connect just to have to reconnect moments later due to it disconnecting. App is trash and is a rip off to pay for | Seemed I had to upgrade. Wasted my time | Trash | Keeps saying wrong pin every time I enter the code on the screen??? | Let‚Äôs you use it for free for a minute or two and then demands payment to continue using it at all. Waste of time.

Amazing app | La mejor manera para poder comprar lo que siempre has deseado, excelente p√°gina. | Great site I use them all\nThe time. I highly recommend | Great company for selection and service   Including returns. | I love it!!!!! | I cant put different address for delivery to the billing for pay. | Quick and wonderful thanks a lot Gonna see me very soon ‚úåüèø | Farfartch is my favourite app for online shopping . It‚Äôs great. | Best automated cataloging of what a wardrobe should beüßúüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | They sold me fake product, don‚Äôt buy guys I will never waste my money on Farfetch | I‚Äôm praying I don‚Äôt get scammed. | I appreciate your choice of clothing an quality also | Why the price of the dress change? | I love shopping at farfetch they offer the best products and services with the most competitive prices | If you decide to return something you will never get your money back. They provide wrong return shipping labels and your return will return to you in 1 month. Very poor customer service. They just tell you that they're trying to solve the problem but in reality doing nothing. FRAUD. | This app is AMAZING and very easy to use will most likely shop more often . The prices are great | Most of the time the app and website barely function. Rendering both unusable. I've since then moved to other platforms like Ssense. | Love shopping here üî• | Excellent price and quality | App is great source to get foreign products I wouldn‚Äôt normally be able to buy, but I have issues with Versace (specifically one of their customer service associates) and I never want to buy from them again. It would be nice to be able to block Versace from showing up when I‚Äôm browsing the app. | I had the worst shopping experience ever. I purchased an Off-White Belted trouser, but it arrived without the belt. These are just simple black trousers, and the belt is their main feature. This was a last-minute purchase for a wedding, and there was no time to return it and wait for a new one. My blazer was also from Off-White, and I didn't want trousers of a different material and brand, so I kept them for the wedding. Despite my repeated requests for the belt, they were unable to send it. After many attempts, they offered me free shipping for my next purchase, a 5% refund on the item, which was $25, and then 10%. This is ridiculous. We're talking about Off-White, not Zara; this is a high-end fashion brand, and the item arrived missing its main feature. I've been asking to receive my belt, but they are unable. I am now requesting a 50% refund, but they are not agreeing to it. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. They ruined my wedding outfit, as I had to buy another belt for my Off-White ensemble, and now they are not even offering a fair resolution for their mistake. | You are very late in customs services I raise a request to return order every time you didn‚Äôt send your driver to pick it so I need to reschedule it again !!!! Same thing repeated!!! | Me encanta todo y la app es super f√°cil. Siempre compro ah√≠ y encuentro buenas promociones! | Big Fan üíÄ. | Bad app it support hate and religious hate I deleted this app and never gonna buy from them again | ‚Ä¶these sandals are a dream! | It all started in June 2022 I was buy a Balmain handbag When I received it It was the worst experience the bag It was used and without the stickers so in this year 2023 I was buy a Balenciaga sunglasses And I received them with scratches and used so I do my return BUT NOW they don‚Äôt want do give me my money back because they say balenciaga He supposedly doesn't want to give me my money back blah blah blah | Love the unique offerings of this website, plus I appreciate the essential worker discount. | Satisfactory | Love Fav! I love this place to find quality and fashion! | I can‚Äôt wait for my Pucci! Thank you! ü§ç | Bought a handbag about a month ago. They shipped it with FedEx but I never received it. The customer service first impression is to accuse me of not being home. While in fact I am at home for all three times they ‚Äòtry‚Äô to deliver it. Then the customer service keep saying it is delivered and and cannot refund me, which implies I lied about the bag? This is the last time I shop on Farfetch. I genuinely suggest a different delivery service rather than FedEx, they are known for stealing customers‚Äô packages | Genuine and helpful customer service team\nTrustworthy | Customer service is terrible! Totally incompetent, my order was delayed for weeks, and no updates were followed. | Best Supporting shopping experience | Everything always looks exactly as it does on my line when I receive it | Luvvvv | I wholeheartedly love this app because of great customer services, curated collection of high-end items, and delivery service is right on time. While I love the Farfetch app, however, I got several issues with it.\n\nFirst, my wishlist has a limit (100 items) and I cannot continue to favorite every item I liked. When I exceed the amount, the previous products I've favorited disappeared. I wish the wishlist feature would allowed infinite favorites just in case any of them went on sale or out of stock.\n\nSecondly, the descriptions for some items are a little vague. When I tried to shop for latest runway pieces from Vogue, especially the ready-to-wear pieces, the items do not come with the description elaborate which collections did it come from.\n\nThird, I can't choose men and women's items at the same time. I want to buy designer bags for my friends, however, I have to change the gender all the time. I wish there is a feature where you can shop any designer things regardless of gender, then, the items indicate if they are appropriate for masculine or feminine attire. \n\nOverall, these are couple of issues I have with it. Some can be overlooked since it just a complaint, but as a long time user of Farfetch, I am satisfied with shopping high-end products and probably one of the most legit app I've used. | They Have A Wide Range Of Items. I Think they Could Do A Better Job With The New In Segment I‚Äôve Seen The Same Items For Like 2-3 Weeks | I responded to a far-fetched ad for $50 for my first purchase and after that nothing I didn‚Äôt get nothing off of my almost $500 purchase. Disappointed | I can find more clothing selection easily than any other designer app! | I ordered a taupe purse at the end of May, it arrived on June 5 but a pink purse, not what I ordered. So I started return process and shipped the purse back using UPS label provided by Farfetch. The pacakge arrived at the destination in the shipping label on June 9 but they did not process on time as promised on their return policy. They updated their return policy in the meantime and now my order is \"non-returnable\" even though I already returned the item and it's their mistake for sending wrong item. | Me encanta la p√°gina | We had a few hiccups at first because they kept canceling my order but after I called and talk to the representative I can order with no issues but yea Farfetch never miss they always have wat I need I love y‚Äôall | I want to thank FF for introducing this styling service which sent me so many beautiful and appropriate options exactly to my taste and style. This service has really set FF apart and now will be my first choice for online shopping.  Thank you FF for being ahead of the game! | The place where I shop it is Farfetch.\nNever go to a mall or any shopping centre.\nWhy I should go and I can find the same item in here with the same quality and cheaper price. | I got a good deal a hoodie and they never ship it they cancel my order like 3 days after but the hoodie is still online at 3X+ the amount I pay. | Instagram ad shows specific items stating that there‚Äôs 60% off on it\nAfter the installation I looked them up, it‚Äôs sold at full price | Muito bom o

I can email or text directly from the app. Or just save it to my phone.  Thank you! | In love with this app. I use it for my personal use and for office use as well. Highly recommend it. | Works very well, easy to use, great value. | I use this app daily for work | I use the heck out of this program, scanning documents in the middle of the night and extremely low light and difficult conditions and it rocks! Thank you very much! | I‚Äôve never liked these apps that advertise as ‚Äúfree‚Äù, then at the end of the install tell you there‚Äôs a monthly weekly daily or yearly charge just for having it on your device.  So I deleted it as soon as it was installed. | üëçüèª | Excelente | Great easy to use App | Love that I can send scans directly to Ancesry! | I use this every day works very very well | Saves so much time and easy to use!! | I got IScanner over a year ago once I decided to restart my Real Estate investment business. It has gone beyond serving its purposes. I can see it is capable of doing so much more if you have the time to learn and play with it. I‚Äôm sure my use is the basics. I love it! Highly recommend | This app is user friendly and works great‚Ä¶has lots of editing features. You won‚Äôt be disappointed it is worth the cost! | Muy buena | It‚Äôs easy to use and so convenient!! | Great app | I‚Äôm having trouble sending my documents to a groups text again. I have to start a new one every time. Other then that I love the app | Maravilloso | Best app ever, highly recommend | I downloaded to scan things into PDF for taxes, but even doing the few singly the ads block everything and the program freezes up.

What makes it worse is that there is no one time purchase option. Terrible. | On ipad the toolbar does not appear ..i dnt know its n issue or not | Awesome | Very, very easy to work around and not a harsh editing style either which has been a huge plus. 10/10 would recommend if you take lots of photos on an iPhone and want to upgrade from just the edit option in the photos app. | Don‚Äôt even waste your time, please! Once you download the app and open it for the first time, every single thing is hidden behind a paywall. And yes, even if you‚Äôve bought the app a long time ago as a ‚Äúlifetime unlimited‚Äù customer, you will be prompted to subscribe to their new pricing. Basically telling you that what you paid for years before, is no longer valid! | I absolutely love this app and recommended it to all of my friends. | Aun no arreglan el problema de colocar en pantalla completa la aplicaci√≥n en forma horizontal‚Ä¶ llevo como 1 a√±o sin poder usar las herramientas como apertura, lentes, luz, etc‚Ä¶ no parecen esas herramientas‚Ä¶ reporte varias veces el problema y no lo solucionan.. compre la app hace a√±os atr√°s y ahora no la puedo usar sin estar conectado a internet porque me sale la ventana de pagar suscripci√≥n‚Ä¶ acaso esperan que les vuelva a pagar por algo que ya compre..??? Est√°n equivocados‚Ä¶ deber√≠an ser sancionados por este tipo de practicas il√≠citas‚Ä¶ es una lastima ya que eran una de mis aplicaciones favoritas‚Ä¶ espero recapaciten y arreglen estos problemas.. | Take your photos to the next level or even pro level with great app. üëçüèª | Â•Ω | I‚Äôve bought the app years ago and after the update most of the features that used to be available as paid became again for money!!\nWhy?! | The app used to be free for the most basic function. It‚Äôs now a ridiculous 3.99 a week. Way to ruin a great app. | The main menu bar is missing from the edit view.

I even tried deleting and reinstalling it.. any ideas? | For years, Focos was my go to app for Portrait mode editing, but it is now forcing you to choose a subscription plan. Super disappointing and I‚Äôll be deleting it and looking for another app. | It‚Äôs strictly a pay to use app with a one (1) week  free trial. | Can‚Äôt use app without switching pro version\nWroste app | I‚Äôve just starting using this, but for the past 2 days it‚Äôs been incredibly fun! It‚Äôs so detailed oriented and amazingly intense it I‚Äô is quickly becoming my go-to, well over Lightroom! Great job! | Best | I used to love this app, transforming my lame photos into impressive shots. BUT due to the greed of the devs nothing in this app is free anymore. | I used this app for free for 4 years now I got a new phone and the app is not free anymore, you gotta pay to use the most basic feature! So disappointed! | They removed features that I paid for and now require a subscription to access. | It is not free anymore. Very disappointing. I used to use this app for my pictures. Recently I reset my phone and then download this app and guess what!! it‚Äôs not free anymore üòû | This app used to be my favorite. I paid the subscription without even using the Pro features just to support the app even though the main features were free. Now they've removed the lifetime price, screwed people out of a \"lifetime\" option they've already paid for, and exponentially raised the price. You also cannot use it at all anymore without paying for Pro, when all of the basic features used to be free. Extremely disappointing that the developers decided to go down this route. | Greedy devs raising price for something people had already paid for and no longer honoring previous subscriptions.\n\nGross behavior, $16 a month is absolutely ridiculous. | Purchased a LIFETIME subscription 3 YEARS AGO. Now the iPad version is almost completely disabled. All of the ‚Äúextras‚Äù I paid for have been removed. How does Apple allow this type of theft to continue? | Quicker loading and fun to use | This app has made my editing a lot easier | I just love the app more and more as I learn how to use it. Very good app. | App used to be free, then they locked everything behind a firewall. I get the economics of it, but EVERYTHING?! And for that much per month/year? Good riddance | Greedy developer, crap app. Way to go and screw all your customers and supporters in your quest to further exploit your users via a subscription model.  App deleted, will NEVER support your crap company again. | This app use to be free. Delete | Sorry. Too complicated for me. | Trying to work with a photo of 4 faces and it can't work with them all in same focus or change the shape.  It keeps at least 1 face blurry.  The depth is about the same for each face.  Single faces work great.  Multiple faces, not so much. | Good app | This app is amazing | I‚Äôve been using this app for a long time for free and now every feature (including just taking a basic photo through the app) is blocked by a paywall for $70 a year. Sorry, but in what world? I loved this app. Sad to see it go this way. | Love it | Please make some features free I'm your old customer for so many years I have been using focos. Please please dont do this with us. I cannot afford buying it | I absolutely love it but I feel like they can or should make a few improvements over time to make it a bit easier to use or customize and make more convenient. But IT IS MY FAVORITE FOR CREATING A FOCAL POINT IN PICS!! | Esta aplicaci√≥n es buena y la utilizo mucho | This app was fantastic for quite some time.  It‚Äôs nothing but a waste on my iPad Pro now.  Every time there is a Focos update for my iPad, I cannot help but wonder if the developer will finally resolve the issue after nearly a year.

Jlynne payne,,, BEAUTIFUL,,, February 2024 STILL AWEDOME THANK YOU ALL FOR THIE FREE APP I LOVE IT | So so | Muy buena aplicaci√≥n | I would give a rate of 3 bc I can‚Äôt play music offline or online | The BEST music app ever because first u don‚Äôt really have to pay to listen to music and they Team3 with YouTube so we can watch video‚Äôs and listen to music Probably the Best music app I ever used in my whole lifeüòÅ anyway Thanks YouTube and this music app for letting this happenü§ó | I searched and searched but literally no song was available offline not good if you want an offline listener ü´∂üèæ | I love this app, but it‚Äôs been crashing frequently all of a sudden. I hope this gets fixed soon. | Popcorn Pretzels Goldfish M&M‚Äôs Theater A lions vs hyenas and sharp tooth vs little foot‚Äôs death and Barbie sleeping beauty cruella devil jasper and Horace Gwen Courtney Heather Lindsay Sierra Batgirl Supergirl Bumblebee Sparkly Girl Green Lantern and Wonder Woman | You can only buy something stupid for offline music | Not good app | excelente. | I tap on a song and it plays for 3 seconds and stops and plays and stops you better fix it or you will lose a lot of stars and money | I‚Äôm trying to cancel my subscription but I can‚Äôt find the option to cancel it , the app forcing me to renew only | Nice | I had a very hard time using this app. Here is why! 1.The app wouldn‚Äôt play my whole playlist. 2. The songs wouldn‚Äôt load! 3.It wouldn‚Äôt search the songs that I put in the search bar. Now I know to read the reviews before I download apps! I just didn‚Äôt like the app would not work.üòî | I bought the ads free premium and there are still ads. Not worth my time or money. Uninstalling | Hi their I have a problem my subscrition deleted automaticly can you fix it thank you | I remember in early 2021 not being able to download Spotify because of my phone type and I would use this app. It just brings back so many memories | Why I can‚Äôt download the music in my file in my phone just stuff just take my money | ÿ∑ÿ≤ ŸÅŸäŸÉŸÖ ŸàŸÅŸáŸÑ ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖÿ¨ | Bro I wanted to download SnapTube but I can‚Äôt so I was looking for some apps I can listen while making some notes and after I download this app I tired to listen 3008 Friday thame song and when I go into the notes IS STARTED REPECTING BRO HOW AM I GONNA LISTEN!!?? AND WHY EVERYONE GIVE 4 STARS OR 5 | Simple to use, great for when you can‚Äôt get connected and you need your music! | I love the fact that you can make crappy headphones sound better, but the ads are terrible. Not even my type of ads! Cmon guys, you could‚Äôve done better with less ads. Like get real! | Worthless waste of timd | Everything you touch is an add can‚Äôt play a song period | The app will not let me import anything to offline | 1st time when i install it that time NO ADS also paly when screen locked but today i update it now ADS more then official youtube app, when screen locked it stop playing \n\nLong time ago i chat with APP owner and discuss ADS issues but they no fix this they make more garbage in new updates, OFICIAL YOUTUBE have less ADS, why we install this app and use itü§Ø | Muy excelente quisiera descargarlas a mi dispositivo es lo √∫nico pero muy buena | I should not have to watch a add to pause my music it‚Äôs a total waste of time and I would not recommend it to anyone ever waste of my time | The only reason I use this app still is because literally every other app that plays music Picture in Picture requires a subscription. The biggest problem with this app is the fact that there are so many ads one time I got 10 ads in a row without being able to stop it. Please stop giving me ads! I‚Äôd be fine if you got only 1 ad when you entered the app for the first time today. | I can listen to music, and that‚Äôs about all. I can‚Äôt download anything... | Didn‚Äôt do it for me commercial every time you want to listen a song playlist did not work you can‚Äôt listen and get off the application √† the same time | Me gusta | You get a bunch of ads some right when you open the app others when your trying to resume or pause your song, your song will pause if you try going to a different app or if you turn off your phone, but when you turn off your phone you‚Äôre sometimes able to resume it but it‚Äôs really annoying to do that because you kinda have to spam the resume button and then if it doesn‚Äôt resume and you go back to the app (for both turning your phone back on or going back to the app after trying to go to a different one) you see that your music was stopped because of a surprise ad that popped up when you turned off your phone.\n\nSo way, way, to many ads. Pauses your song when you switch apps or turn off your phone and just is kinda crappy in general because you can only have select songs for offline mode. But it is good for if you don‚Äôt feel like using YouTube. I don‚Äôt know what the ad free versions like because I‚Äôm not about to go and waste my money on an app that isn‚Äôt really that reliable for music. | Pasan muchos anuncios | Very nice app | It was fine not too long ago, a 5 or 10 second add every now and then. Now there‚Äôs a 30 second add anytime you change a song or do anything really. Frequency or adds is way overboard. | The app itself is good, I like the functions like the speed altering, but long ads pop up every time I go to play a song or press pause. It keeps me from actually being able to play the music | Ads is everywhere. Even when you run your file before listening, the sound of your file goes in parallel and you have to watch ads.  \n\nOne star is even good for this application.  \n\nHave no desire to purchase the paid version after that. | Really annoying when I have to go to bed | I can‚Äôt play music offline and idk if it me or whatever but I don‚Äôt like it fix it now bro | This app is so good but sometimes it would not let me on the app | This app is amazing it has no ads and has any song,YouTube video, and podcast you want also it has downloadable music but not all of it but you can pay 4$ a week and can listen to any song offline also which would be downloading the music or you can pay 40$ a year witch is 79% off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ü§©ü§©ü§©üòÅüòÅüòçüòçüòç \nBut ether way it‚Äôs the best app I have had | ***‚Äîjuly 11 22. update. The app is cool , I use it daily. It has a great equalizer. Sounds really good. Tho, there aren‚Äôt a lot of your favorite songs you can download, they‚Äôre some things you can. Thanks for the developer response as well! Reminded me to come give a new update. Thanks. *‚Äî‚Äî July 1 22. ***It‚Äôs just a player. A search engine.
