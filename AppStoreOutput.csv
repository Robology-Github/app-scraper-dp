SEE IT ON A MAP

Every time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.

STORE PLANS OFFLINE

All your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.

GET ON THE ROAD

Looking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.

COLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS

For group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.

STAY ORGANIZED

Access flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.

GET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION

For each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.

CONTROL YOUR SPENDING

Set a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/04/99/7d/04997d95-7783-c032-fbaf-0eeb52bbbd68/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","106180608","13.0","2019-08-22T07:00:00Z","2024-04-11T22:31:17Z","Wanderlog's available in more languages!

Every thing I click on has constant tool tips even though I have that turned off in settings. It keeps asking me if I want Pro and has an x to hide it but it always comes back the next time. Just overloads you with options and questions as well.

Edit: Co-founder responded. Apparently, even though you have tool tips disabled, they still show some. Also never addressed the constant nagging to buy Pro even though you click the x to stop showing it (comes back). And $50 is ridiculous. $10, yes. A useful app but the endless amount of tips and bags will lead me elsewhere if it continues. | I liked that you are able to see the places you want to visit in a map, that way you can organize your itinerary by area. That helped me creating my route to my trip to Japan. I will definitely use it for my next trip. | This app is so amazing. I highly recommend it. After using it to plan a 4 month trip I love it. It does all it says it does. A thing or 2 I could only do on the app or on the computer but I could do all it says it does. On one thing I had a question and got a quick & detailed response from the developer (email is in the help section of app). | I was hoping this would work for road trips. Things do do from Point A to Point B | Just got back from a 9 day on-the-go Spain trip.  Wanderlog made planning the trip easier (being able to visualize everything on the map and drag-and-drop places to different days/times was great!).  We put in all of our flights/trains/rental-cars, restaurants, sites...  And my wife and I were able to collaborate. I'd get excited seeing her putitng in a Flamenco concert she booked for one evening for example. And then on the trip, it was so nice to have one place to reference for everything about our plans. 

I can honestl say Wanderlog made our trip better than it would have been. | I literally unsubscribed from the free trial offer five minutes after adding it and was still charged. And with you’re “refund policy” being only if an enforcement company requires you to, you actually don’t care about your users. Just greedy. I would like my money back | Great app for organizing your trip!  From collecting reservation information to identifying attractions to creating itineraries. It does it all. Highly recommended! | I’ve been using Wanderlog for close to a year now and very much love the app + website. For each destination, I start with a master list of places of interest. Using existing lists are extremely helpful to make the master list. Then I build an itinerary from it. Adding approximate time spent at the place and the app providing time between the places helps a lot when planning. What I’ve been most impressed with is the robustness of the app. I haven’t had any issue with incorrect information, data loss, app crashing or unavailability. The UI / UX is very intuitive. They have quite a few other features that I can being useful. | This app has made planning vacations so much easier to organize! I love how simple it is to build my itinerary and see how things are situated on the map. It’s also great for tracking how much money I’m spending! A must have for travelers! | Well, I was told I would get notification after my free trial period before they took my money. But that did not happen and they refuse a refund. So try at your own risk, but you might get your money stolen. | I don’t ever really write reviews, but I love to travel. I had mostly been writing out my itineraries on paper, but than I decided it might be easier to do with an app. So I downloaded a bunch, like 10, and just tried them out. Wanderlog was truly, by far, above the rest. The budget feature in particular was fantastic, I went to Europe with a bunch of friends and it was really helpful for tracking expenses, and the fact that it automatically converts currency within calculations is really helpful and a nice touch. I now use wanderlog every time I travel and I really love it. | This app has it all. I love all of the organization. The mapping is the best part! I also love knowing how long it will take to get from place to place. The only drawback is, in some there google driven guides the places are closed for good. | Love the sharing option. Makes itinarary so much easier. | This has been amazing app from throwing ideas together to really finalizing the smallest details.  However, what is more important is the support team, I spent months putting a trip together and accidentally deleted it, within hours they were able to restore my trip and save me hours of recreation, and many more tears. | One of the best apps i used in japan, it really organized my trip. | first of all, it is deceiving when it says sign up for the pro version for roughly around three dollars a month when in reality you sign up for the annual price it does not give you a month-to-month option. 

Second of all the pro features don’t even work the whole point was for it to pull your itinerary information and add your flight info automatically. instead it pulled old itineraries from the last year or two that are already irrelevant. I don’t understand why it would search that far back and my most recent emails with the upcoming flight info couldn’t even be added into the app. I had to manually add my flight info. 

third of all as soon as you create your account, your bombarded with 20+ pop-ups I selected no more tips and it’s still kept coming up with all of these pop-ups. It was so annoying. | Would recommend it to anyone 
Help me and my girlfriend sort out everything we needed easily during our travels | I acquired this app based on its outstanding reviews; however, it has proven to be a profound disappointment. Not only is it functionally inadequate, but it also requires a subscription. Rather than providing useful suggestions, it merely retrieves articles about activities in various cities, a task I could easily perform myself. My primary desire was for quick itinerary suggestions, a feature this app fails to deliver. Additionally, its incessant interruptions to offer tips on its interface only compound the frustration. One must question the design decisions that led to such a cumbersome user experience. | Such a nice app to lean on when you have a trip planned and have a lot of cooks in the kitchen of planning 😄 | Really great app | I have waited all my life for a way to plan trips this efficiently. Thank you for making such an incredible app! I tell everyone about it. | This app helped me keep a month long multi-city trip through Europe organized.  I love that it has the ability to forward emails to your itinerary and it will upload the confirmation directly for hotels, transit and other reservations.  I was able to share it with my co-travelers and they can add points of interest and help with to-do list and wish lists.  If this can keep me organized so easily, then it’s definitely worth it! | If you’re a freak about organizing your trips, everything about this app is spot on! | I tried this for LA and it had locations WAY far off like Palm Springs Liberace house. It also had a charity museum that had no activity on instagram since 2020….unless I’m missing something.  Also the charity location is an hour away from the location I input.  It had a “permanently closed” restaurant listed.  Wasted my time.I don’t get it . | this app would be amazing if fully worked!! won’t let me add certain places to my lists. no reason. just does nothing when you click add. don’t have this problem using the web version ?? | I use my home town in Delaware and asked for it to suggest some places to go out to eat. Well it picked three places I never heard of, the name of the town was right but they were in Canada a few hundred miles away. 
Ok so I understand this is a trip planner but I’d love to have a better control over where the heck this AI thinks I should go. Nope, not going to buy this one! | So helpful!! This made our trip so much better. It makes planning easier and more fun, and traveling so much less stressful. Love the map feature where you can see the layout of your itinerary. I kept everything in my notes app before and it was a pain. You need this! Love the free features too. | I love this app! I can make checklists (packing lists and lists to help me remember what I need for each daily adventure). The way you can forward a hotel or flight or rental car reservation and it automatically adds it all to your itenerary including confirmation numbers, addresses and cost for your budget is phenomenal. I love how it offers suggestions on sights to see and things to do and places to eat. Plus all of my friends or family whom I invite to share it with can also have all the information right at hand. I’d give this app 100 stars if possible. I’ve used it for 5 trips now and will never use anything else. | A great app for traveling together with friends. Easy to upload accommodations, schedules, and finances. If you are traveling with friends this app is perfect. I highly recommend it!!! | Ever since I discovered Wanderlog, I’ve used it to plan every trip I’ve been on and have told anyone who will listen about it. The app’s itinerary building functions, the option to create different lists, and the ability to share with others makes it indispensable. It’s near perfect and I recommend the following to the developers: allows old trips to be archived automatically based on dates, allow blocking for nonspecific activities in the itinerary, incorporate the visited map from the web into the app, and add a feature to organize places you’d like to visit by continent, country, etc. | Overall this is an amazing all. I’ve always used google sheets to plan my trip because the alternatives weren’t great. For the first time, I started using an app that solves my need right from planing to on the road. 

Having said that, the app is slow when you add many locations. Additionally, the drive times are incorrect on the app. So I have to switch to computer. The route optimization cannot be done across multiple days. If some of these can be fixed, I’ll be happy to pay for the app. | I’m type A personality and I knew for my trip I needed somewhere I could write down an itinerary. Wanderlog was that and more! I loved being able to plug in all the things and have everything in one place. Thank you thank you thank you! | I had great hopes in using this app. However, it is not sophisticated enough to insert manual planning. I have a trip already planned that I tried to set up in this app and it just doesn’t work. I already have plane tickets, hotels, cruise, etc. It just won’t let me EASILY add everything. Not worth the effort in trying to figure it out. Stick with the spreadsheet!! | I downloaded this app to plan a roadtrip to the Philippines. I love how simple and customizable it is. I also love that you can share it to people and they don’t have to download the app to view or edit it. Most locations I need are searchable. It’s mostly free until I want to save it offline which is great because I can plan free before my trip and only pay for it when I need it.

Some suggestions that would make this app even better: 
- Having the option to make certain pages private
- Being able to mention your tripmates and make action items so it’s clear on who is responsible for what
- Being able to pool money as a trip mate and assigning who is responsible for paying. I feel like a lot of group trips, there is a designated person for food, lodging, gas, etc.
- Being able to customize the color of Notes. I have a few and it blends in really well with the Places because they are the same color.
- Being able to assign sub-budgets, perhaps by Place you’re going to or by type of expense (food, lodging, gas etc) | We used Wanderlog for the first time on a 10 day trip and it was amazing!  Easy to set up, great recommendations!  Will be using for all trips from now on. | Please make this app compatible with Airbnb!!! It’s a pretty good app, but there seem to be a lot of minor glitches. I really like that it gives me a time frame to get from one point to the other and it creates the most seamless transition, but it is super slow and I can’t add accommodations for Airbnb. Also, once I’ve gotten rid of a box, I don’t want it to keep popping up…it’s incredibly frustrating. | Wowed by the amount of information I can find in this app. Wanderlog has asked and answered all of the questions you have about traveling, organized them and put them all in one app. SO useful!  I'm just at the tip of the iceberg and can't wait to explore more! | This app really was essential in the planning of my trip. It allowed me to make a list of all the things we wanted to do and see and then work to fill in the gaps!  I referred to it when e had some down time or looking for a place to eat nearby. | Literally the best app for planning trips. So easy to use and able to collaborate with friends! | Loved this app. It really helped me plan for a better trip as to maximize areas and sites I wanted to see. I will definitely use it from now on when planning. | Very User Friendly!  My son recommended this app and honestly I was hesitant. I normally turn to paper and pen. But boy what a revelation this app turned out to be; so convenient to have everything in one place. Loading travel plans was a breeze!  Adding places to visit was easy. Also the app provides ideas for stops. Love it. | I had plans to use this and after 1 week got a hard stop. | This app has every feature I would put into a travel planning app! I am thrilled with it! | I am really enjoying the app. It would be helpful if there was a driving map, so we don’t have to use other apps for planning. | I used this app to plan my trip to Japan and absolutely LOVED how easy it was to plan out all the restaurants, landmarks, train stations, and hotels on the map and organize everything into their own respective categories! I found it so helpful that they also auto color code the points on the map based on the category I put them in (I put them in categories of cafes, restaurants, transportation stops, etc.). I had the best trip all because I was able to add all my notes into this app, and now I send my itinerary to everyone I can and always tell my friends and family to plan everything using this app! | Wonderful app! I love to able to save all the places of interest and it auto populates in the map & numbered too. Great for organizing my days on a trip and even adding what restaurants I want to visit etc. Super helpful app and very easy to use! Love it and highly recommend it. | This app totally changed how I plan and travel!!! I am recommending it to everyone I know. We went to Berlin as a family of 5. Everyone had access to the itinerary for planning purposes. And I, as the planner, was able to put all of our trip details (and all my research) in one place, making a huge improvement in how we sightsee. This is a very robust and useful travel tool! | I have always used Roadtrippers until they started ripping people off with their prices.   I made the switch and really like using wonderlog now.   It is different from when I was used to using, but I think I like it a lot better.  I love the easy way you can keep all of your documents together in one place. | I really hate planning trips…not because I don’t enjoy picking out cool places to go, but because I struggle with things like timing and organization. This app really helped me to put together an itinerary that included all of the places I wanted to go, plus gave me a few suggestions to fill in some gaps. 

Will definitely use it for future trips! | Wanderlog is awesome for helping organize and coordinage those big trips--especially internationally. It was super useful to both plan our own daily itineraries as well as utilize the recommendations made by Wanderlog.

Easy to use and email notifications were great | I stumbled upon this app about 5 years ago before it became huge and my opinion has never changed. It’s such a great app, it’s simplistic and stays up to date as you are on the move (literally!) it is totally worth paying for in my opinion even if you don’t necessarily fly to travel,, you can still make smaller itineraries. It is one of the best apps out there! | I luv this app, it keeps my entire itinerary when I travel in one place and I get alerts through the TripIt app before the airlines send updates. It’s amazing. I highly recommend. | Have used this app for a couple of years now after trying several. I like the rate change notifications as well as changes gate changes and other reminders. Dust wish it was easier to upload travel itineraries created on ChatGPT/or other AI to track the entire vacation. | I do not find a way to contact personnel at TripIt.  Poor customer service options-currently | Not sure how this app has not been acquired by the likes of Apple or some big outfit. It is beyond AMAZING. 

Works like magic and makes checking emails for trip information a thing of the past. Don’t travel as much as I used to but when I do, TripIt is a must use app for all aspects of the trip. Lifesaver!! | Could not upload anything but airline schedule. I will go back to manually generating my schedule and itinerary.  I’m not sure if it was user error but I have given up. Great concept. | This app looks nice, but the ridiculous amount of time that I’m spending to just
• get my trip info imported from my email 
• take my phone number to push SMS messages
• to not have to enter all this info manually
•to not have to forward the info to an email to send to this app
• to figure out how to effectively refresh this app and maybe it will retrieve my flight, hotel, trip reservations..
• see that I just purchased to pro and it still has not populated my upcoming trip..

Is giving free app vibes, when I know I’ve spent money… | I have used this app for over 10 years and consider it one of my go-to apps for travel. It’s simple and easy to use. | Enjoying organizing our trips.   Amazing app.   Worth the effort to have everything organized.   Especially like having it flow to my Apple calendar | Can’t sync email. Can’t edit things within itinerary without it freezing or just not loading or giving errors…seems like it could be a great app tho | I don’t travel much but when I do I use TripIt extensively. It is extremely useful and helps keeps me on track. | Not happy with 25 pdf limitation  AT ALL.  I have a 3 week trip coming up and certain arrangements and tour details will need to be maintained outside of App. Questioning whether Trip It Pro is worth it. I love the app, but this is the main reason I upgraded and spent the money. | TripIt is awesome! I travel frequently and TripIt lets me have all the info I need right in one place without having to lift a finger. | For my trip I booked flights with several different airlines. When I edit the confirmation number for one flight, it saves that confirmation number as the new updated confirmation number for all of my flights on the trip, even though all of the confirmation numbers should be different. | Comprehensive & intuitive app! Pulls all travel plans from email. I receive notices before the airlines notices come through. | I googled for a trip organizer or some sort of reminder for events. And this app popped up. And it was the best decision ever. It made everything so much better, timing, reminders organizer itinerary. I got to do a-lot more of activities and events on my trip thanks to the app and is easy way of keeping everything including address and tickets store and at hand. | Love that it tracks my trips, airline ticket numbers, hotel confirmations, etc. but what I REALLY love is that I can look at it and immediately see when I will be out of town. Yes, that info is already in my calendar, but TripIt segregates my travel schedules in a much more accessible way. Perfect for capturing all of the other vacation/travel related items and categorizing them appropriately. When someone asks if I’m available in September, I look at TripIt first.  That provides the overview. Also, I can share all of our plans with my husband and traveling companions. And I can share my travel info with family that are not traveling, if anyone needs to contact me. Great app. | I just received an alert from TripIt saying that the price had dropped on my flight by $160. Just called the airline and got my $160 credit.

I also like that, all of my reservations are in one place car, hotel, flights. It even gives you warnings when things don’t look right. | This app not only helped me organize my trip and order the activities, but it is SO simply to get everything added! And you can share it with everyone on the trip so everyone has all the information and access to tickets, etc. I would give this app 10 stars if I could! Well done! | This is so great to plan your itinerary. | Excellent app. | Just started testing out this app to see if I want to purchase the pro version. So far it has kinks that need to be fixed before I’ll pay for it. When adding multiple flights to a single trip, it won’t allow you to have multiple confirmation numbers, even when selecting different airlines. I book a lot of separate tickets so this is very frustrating.

Updated to add that if you forward the itineraries, the confirmation numbers are correct. It only glitches if you enter them manually. | This app works the best for coordinating your vacations itinerary. Just email your confirmation s and it sorts out date time and everything. It’s especially helpful in keeping you in sync with the location time zones. Highly recommended for anyone going on trips. | Love the ease of the app. We set up a special email for tripit that we use for all trip notices that integrates with tripit. We have done 370 trips and don't plan on switching apps. I love that Pro keeps your history. I love the text alerts they keep me on the right path and saves me so much time. Everything I need for a trip is here. | Trying to access app, unfortunately crashes started to happen with notice that app is temporarily unavailable. Very disappointing. Removed/Uninstalled app and started again to try and login, same error. | I love the idea everything is in one place but It’s taking forever to add documents and keeps freezing so I have to close and restart every time | Love how it imports trip info from my email. So easy to stay on top of flights and hotels | It is so helpful and so easy to use! | This is my favorite app of all time. If you travel you need this. Easy, even for old folks to use. 10 stars. | I’ve thought this was a solid app for tracking travel plans, but had a wonderful surprise today when I received a text that my Southwest flight in 2 months was $60 cheaper (same flight) and not only told me to call to get a flight credit, but gave me the number. To say I was happy is an understatement. | Love it | Love to organize my trips on this app. Added bonus with Tripit Pro- they notify you if price changes on your flight allowing you to request refund! Love it | There are certainly areas to grow.  But, from my experience this the best and easiest app to use.  I do wish when I send confirmations for events such as concerts, sporting events, tours or excursions it would do a better job in adding to the plan with the appropriate event type. 

My wife and I share the travel planning.  This really helps us keep track of what’s been purchased and what still needs to be addressed.

 In the future I could imagine this app or a competitor leveraging machine learning and/or AI to do something special.  Probably would get purchased by one of the big players in the space like Expedia or booking.com | Love the one stop shop for tracking all my business travel

One thing. I wish that when I check into to flights it would allow me to add the boarding pass to my apply wallet, but I have to go on the website to do that, rather than TripIt. I mainly fly southwest so it may just be with that airline. | I’m having trouble importing new trip details from my emails on file. Not sure why this stopped happening. | TripIt is my favorite travel app. I don’t know how they do what they do, but they always beat the airlines when it comes to providing flight delays, cancellations, and gate change notifications. if you travel a lot, TripIt Pro definitely is worth it. | I’ve planned two trips in a few weeks. I’ve used this app and it has made them so easy. I have coordinated a trip for three people with three different airline itineraries, nightly dinner at six different locations for the week, to and from transportation and events. Talk about an easy effort, everything set up automatically and I was able to email it to the folks involved! Thank you for creating an app that actually does what it says it’s going to do and works so effectively!! | Simple and easy to coordinate hotel/car/flight information. Simple to look back and find the info as well. | I have had this app for about a year and I love, love, love it. I usually have several trips in the planning stage. This app lets me keep track of everything in one place. I easily see exactly what I have booked from flights, hotels, tours, restaurant reservations, theater performances and just about anything else. It is easy to use and edit any change of plans. I have recommended this app to friends. I am so glad I have this app. | It has been a great help to me in organizing my trips. | Oh my God I just learned about this app today and played with it for 10 minutes and it’s so helpful to organize my itinerary and saved me a lot of manual work. I’m totally impressed. | I have almost 4 million seat miles on AA.  I use this for every trip business and personal.  Saves a ton of time and it organizes everything involved in travel.  It’s awesome. | This travel app is absolutely amazing!
Create a trip and send confirmation emails to input!  Helps you catch errors, make sure you have no gaps, etc. includes all transportations, reservations, lodging etc with all the info you need in it. | Was seriously loving this app to plan a big trip with the family. Lots of planes, trains, hotels to keep track of. Once I realized the max PDF files was 3 with the free version I immediately upgraded to Pro to then only find out that they once again maxed out at 25 uploads. Geez…. It was my main reason for paying! | This is the best app ever I shared it with two friends that are not Internet savvy, and they are very excited to use this for their upcoming European trip.  My friend and I are able to share our updates and I love the expansions on each location that provides more detail that we don’t have to look up. I do wish they could add some sort of budget where you could see the total of your budget at the top or something but other than that it’s amazing. It’s a great app they can be used with, anything you’re doing on your trip and I love the chronological order | I’ve been using KAYAK for a while to plan and share trip information, but it isn’t a perfect tool, so I thought I’d try TripIt for a while. 

It is easy to add your plans to TripIt, just forward it reservation emails; Kayak does this too. You can also enter or change details manually. Tripit is somewhat better than kayak for this. 

With TripIt, it is easy to share a trip with participants who can update the trip with you (e.g. one person works on transportation, another on lodging, etc). The whole trip collaboration thing is easier with TripIt than KAYAK. 

The subscribed calendar support in KAYAK is much better than TripIt. With KAYAK you can see all your trips, including flights and lodging, on your device calendar. I can easily see how my trips fit into all my other plans. Other people can see my trips on their calendars too. I just share a calendar link with friends and family so they can see where I am and how to reach me on their own device calendars without using the kayak app at all; they like that. 

Tripit also supports subscribed calendars, but doesn’t include the detailed plans. This is a showstopper for me; it should be straightforward for TripIt to improve their support, but until they do, I’ll stick with KAYAK. | My account has an odd email added to it, and with every click I get an error. It’s been less then 10 min since downloading it and I want out | I’ve used this app for years and never cease to be impressed by how easy it makes keeping track of travel plans.  Especially because I travel a lot. | This app makes organizing travel simple. I email my confirmations to the app and it organizes my itineraries. I’ve planned complicated itineraries for a few weeks in Europe with tour guides, show tickets, hotels, drivers, trains and planes.

Links and documents are seamless from emails,  webpages, maps, pictures, anything you want to add to your itinerary is done. It is extremely user friendly, easy to update, change, delete or add something. Reservations directly from your multiple emails (including my friends) upload instantly into my itinerary. I love being able to choose my own background pictures for my trips and see them all lined up on my phone. I do wish there was a print feature and maybe a rating system for entries in old trips so i can remember which restaurants/tours etc were worth it and which to skip although i can always just put notes so I’m nitpicking. Really well done and i love not having to worry about adding too many documents or links or trips. Excellent app for travelers! | I love how I can put in items without an and time.  Having issues syncing between devices.  Don't like if you just assign a location as ""afternoon"" it will show at the bottom of the day's itinerary vs in timeline order. Parking also doesn't show on itinerary, but does have it on the main trip page.  I like it better than TripIt and Wonderlog. | I'm a longtime user of TripIt but just switched over and it's 95% of what I was using before. The one (very odd) omission is that when importing flights, for some reason Tripsy doesn't read the name of the passenger—there doesn't even seem to be a field within Tripsy to store that information. It's a very strange product choice, as it can create confusion when a single trip contains multiple flights for multiple people. I emailed the developer about this but didn't get a response. Anyway, it's not quite a dealbreaker and I'm otherwise really happy with Tripsy—a great translation of TripIt's functionality into a beautiful, Apple-native experience. | La aplicación es hermosa estéticamente. Para mí nunca funcionó porque quise compartir el itinerario, el cual me tardé demasiado capturando, para que nunca pudiera compartirlo. Me salia un mensaje que estaba sincronizando con su nube y nunca lo pude compartir. En una lástima, pero tuve que regresar a TripIt. 😔 | I am a Tripsy Pro subscriber and like this app. I use it for dozens of shared trips a year. But it has major problems with editing events. 

Half the time edits don't stick and you close out of an item and find it totally unchanged on your itinerary. 

Time zone support is also a disaster. Time changes don't stick, trips and events move around the world from time zone to time zone. There's no consistent anchor or method to handling and entering times. 

Perhaps all the problems relate to the way the app stores data. Its sync just doesn’t work well and you need to be aware that data loss can occur. Sometimes events revert to previous versions hours after a change was made. If you move an attachment from one event to another, sometimes the attachment will simply disappear; it is neither on the old event nor the new. Sometimes you simply cannot change the time of an event no matter what you do.

Usability and UI design could really use some work. | Setting an itinerary is an exercise in frustration as destination times refuse to save at least 40% of the time. When they do save, the app decides to change dates on relaunch. Needs work.

4/13 And latest update broke the widgets. Sigh | The design of the app is definitely 5 stars. Where the Tripsy is legging no live updates on flight delays or gate changes, other similar apps provide that info. | Takes so much stress out of traveling, especially with a group. Love this app and wouldn’t want to travel without it. | Tripsy is by far the most advanced and user-friendly travel planner that I've used so far and I do not know how there could be an app better. It also is a Macbook friendly app, which is a HUGE plus. Definitely recommend! | Tipsy has many positive features to organize travel. For the most part I really like the app, but there’s one glaring flaw.
When a 5:30am wake-up time becomes 3:30 am, for no good reason except that Tripsy wants to send “emergency “ notifications on the watch that a gate has been assigned or changed, the missing sleep makes this app so. Not. Worth. It.
I have my watch and phone in sleep mode. Only emergency notifications should come through. But Tripsy manages to get them buzzing me anyway. I don’t know why or how, nor can I find a setting to turn it off. II just know that I’ve lost more than a few nights of good sleep before travel due to this bug.
“Why are you wearing your watch at night?” —> sleep monitoring and afib monitoring. 
An app that is this disrespectful of the importance of sleep doesn’t deserve more than two stars, no matter how good or bad it is otherwise. | I love having all trip details in one place, and it’s made convenient to forward confirmation emails to the app and automatically on my phone calendar.  It would be useful to have a pre trip checklist of things I need to do and a place for a packing list. 

I like having a trip history to refer to later if traveling to the same place again. It would be helpful to have a section to rate the restaurant, museum, etc after to help jog my memory for recommendations or if a restaurant is worth a repeat visit. | As I sit here loading EACH and EVERY RESERVATION by Hand, MANUALLY, I absolutely wonder WHAT exactly, I am paying for????
I Can do this MUCH EASIER in my Calendar, Except for the ""supposed to be"" ease of seeing it all on one page? NOT HAPPENING, YET! 
Certainly there has to be a better way. | I am planning our anniversary trip, and I have to say this app is awesome. It not only allows me to add everything to a quick view schedule, but also allows me to add documents that I normally had to rewrite not notes on other apps. Ir can find your flights, carrier, hotel and resort! All in a nicely laid out interface. I use it on an iPad Mini and it looks awesome. | I love I can organize stuff for myself and collaborate on trips with my wife, and it supports everything. Tours, cruises, restaurants, adding files and photos, everything. And lots of clever features sprinkled throughout. Fantastic app. | I've been using TripIt (Pro) for years, but I've always found its interface cumbersome and confusing. While TripIt's new interface is better, I much prefer Tripsy for all my travel planning and tracking.  

Tripsy's clean visual design is beautiful and efficient. The main screen displays the most essential information for my trip or, when traveling, for the current leg of my journey. Details for any portion of the trip are usually just a click away. Tripsy has all the main features that you'd expect from a travel app, such as multiple ways to gather travel documents into a trip (search email, forward an email, Mac/iOS sharing, etc), integration with device calendars, support for multiple travelers and non-traveling planners, document upload, etc. TripIt still has an edge in integrations with other travel apps or services. I suspect Tripsy will add more partnerships as they grow and develop. If there is something you want or need to do in TripIt, Tripsy has the option to sync from  TripIt automatically. I used this option when I started using Tripsy, which made that initial transition (or even a trial) so much easier because I didn't need to reimport my documents for planned trips. 

Tripsy lost a few points in this review because of a few areas where it took effort to accomplish some tasks. There are some quirks in importing the cruise portion of a trip. Most cruise data was imported without a hitch; however, it didn't grab the departure time for days in port. I tried manually adding the departure times for a day in port, but it was annoyingly complex. I'd open the detail for a particular day, but I needed help figuring out how to add the departure time, or when I did, I could only choose from predetermined times. Eventually, I found that I had to select a predetermined time, save the changes, open the details again, scroll down to the proper date of my trip and then I could finally set the appropriate time. This problem doesn't happen often, but it is currently a pain. 

Overall, though, I love using Tripsy!! It is now my go-to travel app. | It really helps plan trips and only one person needs a subscription for everyone to collaborate in the app for a trip. | overall great program.  needs a slight interface overhaul (each day should be very subtle different color than others to easily differentiate them).  And I would highly recommend a calendar view. | If you have an itinerary already defined, this app may help document it.  But if you're actually planning and exploring options, it will get slow you down and make a mess in your calendar database.  Also, I got billed for a month even though I cancelled quickly. | Here are my issues so far-- 1) Multiple times, the entries I have put in and saved change on their own. Train times, for instance, will modify themselves to whatever they want (right now I have a train entry that leaves at 8:42PM and arrives at 8:42PM, despite putting in the accurate times). It is not a time change issue, either, they're just random times and AM/PM. This is very annoying and I'm about to give up on this tool. 2) We're flying halfway across the world and you have to scroll to see the map entirely, no way to zoom out and show the whole trip on the screen. You can zoom in...but you can't zoom out to show Florida and Australia on the same map screen. 3) I subscribed to a monthly plan and was surprised to have recently been charged for a year's access. It just seems like ""Save"" doesn't mean what you think it does in this app. I was really excited to get organized, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere, like TripIt. | Unable to even put in dated. Date Screen does not scroll to find the correct month. Figures a work around but once I put in the ending date, the program changes the start date so the trip is ony 1 day....unless I set the trip up without dates but it is difficult to add places for the new days. | 如果加上每段行程花费多少钱这个功能就更好了 | Tried to change to this because I was over trip it. Not pulling in the text from the email and when I search for what I need it keeps showing something in the wrong country. No thanks. Making my life harder | This product can do more to help plan for your vacation than the free platforms. Both this company and apple customer service are unwilling to listen and help resolve my issue with this platform. | This is a great travel planner APP. It works very well and is reliable. Their customer service is excellent as well. If you are looking for a travel planner APP with a lifetime purchase, just try this one! | I am offering 4-stars in this review solely based on the apps' potential and the current user interface design friendliness. The apps' current state and functionality is actually about a 2-star. I hope to update this review shortly to full 5-star based on some things getting taken care of.
Easier itinerary control - went to manually add (I didn't have easy access to the email), a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport for an early flight, and I couldn't do that because the app had already defined the trip as Thursday to Tuesday based on the flight, with me trying to add a Wednesday ""activity"". I had to go into the settings for the itinerary and change the beginning date. (A further annoyance, rather than just changing one date, once I set the new start, it also required the ending, rather than keeping it on the same by default. There should be a way when adding an activity to go “outside the dat boundary” and have the app automatically update the overall itinerary timeframe.
Side-note to above… The share-to-Tripsy function in the Hilton app only brought hotel name and phone number, not the booked dates, res# or other actual booking details - another potential fix? I don’t know if that is Tripsy not importing correctly, or Hilton not exporting & sharing properly.
Better functionality required for the planning part of a trip. Right now, this app just kind of “catches” all the emails you forward it (or painfully add in manually). When you think of booking a trip, say a vacation getaway, there are many pieces to it (the very reason for this app). Resort, flights, transport from airport to resort, excursions while there, maybe a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport with park-and-fly arrangements. Not all that stuff is booked at once. So being able to easily add in each aspect that needs to be booked, and then have each of those activity icons color-coded on the itinerary page (ie. Red for needs booking, yellow for booked, green for booked and pre-paid) really is necessary. Being able to manually change the color of each activity icon would be a simple step. More complex would be adding in 2 checkboxes in the activity (or right-click / hold-click pop up menu) to indicate when it is booked and when it is paid. Next level of complexity would be for the app to automatically color code based on the details provided in the activity (company and res # fields filled out automatically determines “booked” status, I’m not sure how it would determine paid).
 
Again, overall I like the direction this app is going, but it really needs these updates to become the true “Go-To Travel Planner”. Currently, it is leagues beyond it’s main competitor. Enough that I subscribed to Pro for a year. But without these necessary changes, that subscription will not get extended. Yes, those changes are that necessary, and without them I will go back to Excel and OneNote to manage all my travel, as the app would be missing the “ease” functionality that it should have vs. a more manual process.
Hopefully the devs read this and put these ideas in place very soon. I am sure they have a “roadmap”, but for true traveler functionality, these need to be inserted in the immediate stages of that roadmap.
Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!!! | Several of my trips that are complete on one device are showing up as one-day trips on days where I don’t have travel planned. For example, if I have a trip planned from 11-17 March, the trip shows up as 25-25 March on other devices and shared links. None of the activities are syncing across devices. Reached out to support several weeks ago but haven’t heard back and the issue still hasn’t been fixed. Just know that paying for the premium features is worth it when it works, but if it stops working you’ll be dealing with awful customer support. I’ve also never been able to get the import function to work. I like the interface though. | 地图可以增加高德和百度吗？以及板块如果可以自定义就好了，比如我，只想用 app 收集餐馆。旁边的证件对我来说没什么用。我相信有这样需求的人也不少。

""Can maps include options for Amap (高德) and Baidu (百度)? Additionally, it would be great if users could customize categories. For example, I might only want to use the app to collect information about restaurants, and licenses nearby are not relevant to me. I believe there are many users with similar needs."" | A great app that keeps all your travel plans in one place. A suggestion - would you please consider adding a feature that allows me to set to-do reminders for my trip? It would would be so helpful to be able to set a reminder then later received a push notification. Thank you!! | I was a long time TripIt user and Tripsy is better in every way imaginable | I had been searching for a good itinerary app ever since Google Trips shut down years ago. Tripsy is the best one I've used since then. The auto-import by email (for flights, hotels, cars etc) works great and has only gotten more reliable over the year I've been using it. The iOS and Mac apps are both super easy to use and visually appealing. | have you considered adding a ""packing list"" feature for our trips? | This is a great app. I have used it on multiple trips and I can’t live without it now. The only thing missing is that I would like a way to keep a packing list with a quantity field. So I can always make sure I have everything ready prior to a trip and before a return. | Sadly, was hoping this would be app that might work to share itinerary with other humans traveling with me without them having to buy. Nope. Also, had to manually enter 4 of 6 flts and 1 hotel. Even when trying to share from hotel app to create event had to manually enter data. All of this would be fine but when share itinerary with others it does not provide any details (times of flights, flt #, resv etc | Just got it and it provides no guidance as to how to use the app, how to upload reservations; adding guests seems impossible.... | This app is pretty good and very helpful. However I wish the native Mac app felt more Mac-like. As it is, it feels very much like a big iPhone app. I was hoping that planning my trip and making adjustments would have been much easier on my Mac, but I feel the UI and workflow is very limited since it feels like it is a scaled up iPhone app that does not adequately take advantage of the Mac. It is very good, but I wish it could better take advantage of what the Mac can allow for productivity! | Good app and looking forward to using it for future trips.  Would greatly appreciate a field for cost/expense.  We like to work withina budget and this would greatly help. | Searching and adding a flight is too clunky, taking too many steps. The whole UI feels huge like the buttons are massive, but it doesn't make it more usable. You can have different dates than your flights and it doesn't auto update the actual trip dates. You can accidentally add the same flight twice. Buttons aren't labeled, making the intended flow unclear. Basically feels like a more manual version of Kayak, since I'm not paying for the pro version so I can't do email sync. | I download Mac App and iPhone app. At first I ran into problem where the trip from Mac app does not sync. I email support and the Co-Founder responded to me and help diagnose the issue really fast. In face I never had this fast response from app developer before. And the step to diagnose and communication this is straightforward and sincere.

Apart from that, the app has intuitive user interface and easy to understand and can sync with multiple devices and with friends whom I shared the trip with. This eliminated the need to manually create initerary, which reduce times and free us to explore the activities instead. | Wowww. What a good travel app. Very easy going and with all the information and set up for the best experience travel management | I decided to try the app out because I'm looking for an app that can handle travel planning and has a nice UI, which this one does. 

However I noticed while creating an account that the form fields aren't labeled correctly so you can't auto-generate a password from Keychain.This is coming from a developer so I know how easy it is to integrate those small security features in form fields. This was the first red flag. 

So I made a temporary password and I thought I'd change it afterwards to a more secure password, but there's no option to change my password in the app? I read the other reviews about the support being non-existent, along with the developer not responding to feedback in the app store reviews makes me not trust the construction of this app, or being able to get basic support if something goes wrong (keep in mind this app has paid features). I just deleted the app after deleting my account. | The interface is beautiful but the actual implementaion is terrible. Tried several times to add an event and itinerary and it never showed up. I might have even duplicated the subscription in trying to fix the issue. My reccomendation is to go with TripIt. Not as pretty but it works. | Pro user here for a few years now. I absolutely love the planning aspect but the number of unresolved bugs is incredibly frustrating. Support is nonexistent, you won’t get an answer for weeks. There are issues with timezones, findings things, flight schedules, sync and many others. Each update breaks something. I am really unhappy at this point and will not renew our subscription next year. | A really solid travel organization app. All the nice features you want. If you travel it’s easily worth the subscription price. | I love this app and use it constantly. It has been a game changer for me. Very much appreciate the regular improvements. | I would have probably signed up for the paid service and enjoyed the app. However, I found a charge on my card via my apple account before ever using the app. Canceled subscription. | I have used this app twice this year - a two week trip to Spain, and a five week road trip of the east coast of the united states.  In both cases, I found myself a slave to the app. The cost of setting up parts of a trip, in terms of effort, was much greater than the benefit I got from it. I put this app in a drawer and only pulled it out occasionally. I am happy to let this infernal subscription expire until I MAYBE want to use it again in two years.

I like the app, kinda. It looked good at first. It is good at organizing itineraries, as long as those itinerary are AirBnB and organized tours and have a rigid order that will NEVER change. Other parts of my travel plan, like mapping, seem forced and clunky. I had to find ways to do these outside this app.

After a while I started treating this app as a wallet that held a collection of ideas. Adding and removing things from the itinerary took WAY too much effort. Items simply didn't like to move.

I guess I am not their target market. It is too much of a marginal benefit for me keep paying for. It would be worth a fixed charge with paid upgrades, but this is in no way such a life-changing app that I want to keep paying and paying for it. A folder with a collection of links and copies of my reservations works just as well.

Subscription cancelled. | It does not sync with phone and laptop and my phone is missing trips that i put on my laptop!
PLEASE FIX BECAUSE I LOVE THIS APP IF IT WOULD SIMPLY JUST DO THAT | I've been looking for something like Tripsy for a long time.  the closest thing has been tripit but Tripsy seems setup to add the functionality to be the travel suite everyone will use.  It does a pretty good job parsing emails but my AirBB reserveration didnt work. There doesnt seem to be an option for it monitor emails automatically.   It would be nice to be able to drag items from one day/time to another.   The search functionality for new evetns works well.   I love the map feature.  The whole app is worth it for this feature.    Support has been super responsive.  I'm looking forward to growing with them.  Finally theyre doing what no one else could. | I only see, weekly, monthly and yearly as option but not lifetime | Such a great app - but I wish it had 2 small things:

1. The ability to hide flight paths on the map view. I dont want the map to always default to a zoomed out view that doesn’t show many much relevant detail of the stuff I have planned in my actual destination 

2. The ability to add a location to the itinerary on a certain day, without having to assign it a specific time. I.e. “I want to go here on the second day of my trip, but I don’t care specifically when”",4.69639,2556,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/de/66/36/de663688-50da-18eb-7677-e1757c2bc564/b0c64060-a08f-4bdb-befe-6ae55a286ef2_Intro.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ce/4e/c1/ce4ec1e6-a492-0640-03fa-7cbe1d70de48/207fd846-6a09-47bd-83f0-aabf78dcd12c_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5a/af/b5/5aafb59a-5d6d-61c5-5461-bd421c7556d3/3177ddd7-5fcc-4b30-9c78-f84e8607d000_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/25/1c/39/251c3975-fe25-3d67-54ff-1f382fe07b89/e473061d-29cc-4c2f-8e0b-2d5fbda5a1d8_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8f/26/7f/8f267fa1-5949-5453-85fa-3abad08a7dfb/a1bd7e9f-4eb1-4b59-b153-0caea448b4ea_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d3/9a/49/d39a49aa-fa53-705e-b753-dad78596af57/0ca3eaf4-636a-4588-b444-50d8aa2757b9_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/70/36/6f/70366f2d-b6c8-0bda-d6cf-35170ea52bb0/46188ed7-9da8-4b34-a972-d54f6fd713f4_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e7/84/ee/e784ee37-e856-ff7e-965c-3d7087e03177/614e4fd7-7be1-4fde-b4ad-1d2b6fd2e518_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/83/ee/5c/83ee5ce9-6a8f-117d-a178-6c10eacbaed0/20212e44-be53-45b8-83c5-80f1cb2f1f6a_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/37/04/27/370427e4-2f79-9776-b9f2-4111bbe25c5d/2742267b-eb37-4994-9d89-1da274b3ec0b_9.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4b/8f/01/4b8f01a6-e6e3-48eb-aceb-646e8e5dd424/06fe8bf6-b49a-41e0-b0e3-a2ec692fe4cf_1@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/47/43/21/474321b2-754b-1651-eae2-931c3f6887f6/955359a3-58d3-466b-901b-101615151c74_2@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9f/24/af/9f24af1d-5542-9f10-47a0-f1ed471933ae/13842535-6533-4792-808c-eb6f0aca2891_3@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/37/fa/21/37fa215c-aadf-b625-a4f8-7ba0b7a3dcca/d007491b-4ef7-4a2a-a568-4b784d1f1e59_4@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0e/1a/1c/0e1a1c6e-bfa8-42e0-023a-8a22603add84/9a11790d-5779-4bbd-a463-6dc068e50d67_5@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6f/cc/ba/6fccba70-6e17-7d9b-1fc2-48a3c13b8752/b2856dab-11f0-4895-bb05-43c383649946_6@2x.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""i

When I was planning my trip,  I put in more then 20 stops, because I was trying to see what all my options were in terms of activities, restaurants, and hotels. I meant to remove some of the stops, but before I could, without warning, the app locked my trip and is demanding more money for me to unlock it. I spent a lot of time planning my trip.  I booked my hotels, now I can’t go back and see what I did unless I pay more money! That’s so mean. I now have to plan everything out again, because I refuse to pay a ransom for my trip. I was having so much fun before this happened and I was going to recommend this app to everyone, but this experience took the wind out my sails. If I were you, I’d try and find another company, because I feel this company is a bit deceptive and unethical to lockdown my hard work without warning or a grace period….at least on my first trip so I could figure out how they’re system worked. Such a shame. | Trick you into membership and offer nothing unless it is premium.  You have to scroll in super close to see any attraction and can not see large overview of the area on the map.  Makes it impossible to discover something new.  Total waste of my money for a basic membership. | I’ve had trips planned and had access. Even if an email was sent, I should always have access to my previous trips while paying to use the app.  Prices increased , and trips are now limited as well as stops. I no longer can access my past trips that I’ve paid for and created. Currently, prices keep increasing you now you have to purchase plans. I will no longer use this app. You should have access to your past planned trip! Greed!! I no longer recommend based on continuous price increases for the same access that I use to have. | This app auto renewed at $36 but all the features that were once available have been removed. Even though I paid $36, it  requires  an up charge to actually create a road trip.  Google maps is much better and free.  I’ve been a subscriber for several years and every year the app has less and less features and costs more.  I’d never recommend it. It is worthless.  I can’t even access my previous trips.  What  is the point of charging me a subscription?  I feel completely ripped off. | Really hard to use and lots of spam. Even after unsubscribing | I love Roadtrippers. I use it to plan and route all my road trips. It’s so easy to add n take away waypoints to plan accordingly. It shows highlights and shows off the beaten path places within your distance you tell it. Shows mileage, hours, and even estimated gas cost which is pretty close. | Took us to places that were so fun and all the choices it gave!! Love this app | Little to no Help available. App navigation is a nightmare! | What a huge disappointment!  We have recommended this app to many friends and used it for numerous trips since 2021.  We ultimately subscribed in 2022 at $29 per year for the unlimited stops and completed one cross country road trip in excess of 10K miles.  The features to find interesting stops were what sold us on renewing again in 2023.  We completed another major Northeast road trip last summer and when we were notified the price was increasing to $35.99 a year we felt it was still worth it for the memories we were creating.  Now when I went in to share a previous trip with a friend I find that all my past road-trips are locked and to view them I have to pay more money.  The new tiers reduce the number of stops per trip to barely what was allowed with the previous free version (20 stops vs 15 stops).  They say they notified people of the change, but I cannot find an email alerting to the drastic reduction in capabilities for a significantly higher membership subscription.  The FAQ page states no refunds are available so I guess I am stuck for another year with a useless subscription (I have fixed my automatic renewal).  I do feel the company was not straightforward with warning existing customers with the severity of impact that was coming (losing access to all previous trips, reduction of waypoints per trip, etc).  This was really masked when they gave you the same capabilities for the remaining subscription period. Very poor customer service and loyalty to existing paying customers! They way to fix this is to restore access to previous trip that were purchased under previous plans and give an additional transition period for previous paying customers.  When we discussed our journeys with friends and mutual road-trip enthusiasts, we always provided raving reviews about this app.  Instead of having an ambassador for their company, they have now created someone who will trumpet their deceptive business practices! | Please help me cancel my subscription. I am not using this. It did not work the way I thought it would. | Love this app - the camera quality is amazing. Use this everyday | This app was great in 2018, I did the week trial a couple weeks ago and within an hour I quickly realized that the app was much different and far less helpful than it once was. Ultimately used google for everything I needed.  Now being a few days beyond the week trial period I’ve thrown money away because they’d rather have a bad review than issue a refund from a polite email. Too bad. | I am having so much trouble figuring this app out! | I used to absolutely love this app, used it on a few trips from CA to TX. But like all good things, now they want to charge you an arm and a leg to use it and there is no monthly option! I’m not paying $80/year for a 7 day trip. Might be worth it for anyone taking 4+ trips a year but why in the world can’t it offer a monthly option? Won’t even let me look at my old trips now without paying and no free options at all any more. 👎🏼 | I’ve used this app for over a year and i was pretty satisfied with it To be honest.
Then when i got requested to renew my plan (which i was about to) i noticed that not only the prices went significantly up but also the features included shrunk and i would need to get the most expensive plan in order to get back access to my older trips.
This is disappointing and made me not renew my plan yet.
Pretty bad move guys! | Not only did this app give us bad information during our cross-country move, they will renew your subscription without any warning whatsoever. Basically, they think their customers are suckers and treat you as such. It wasn’t worth the price I paid a year ago when I actually tried to use it, and it certainly isn’t worth the price to have them sneak the charge through without giving you the opportunity to opt out. If your business model is to rely on people to forget about their renewals rather than to provide a product or service that people WANT to continue paying for, then your business is a failure. | I expected Roadtrippers to be a source of information about places we plan to visit on an upcoming roadtrip but instead of being an interactive guide I can only set a trip place A to Place B and a map is shown between those two places. We are planning more of a wander to get from A to B looking for interesting spots to visit on the way, restaurants, local interest, but this doesn’t seem to be what Roadtrippers is about. Glad I only paid the introductory price. | Fine | The app is amazing ive been using it for 3 years now, recently the pricing structure changed since i only do 1 roadtrip yearly it didnt make sense for me to pay for the premium tier, so now i have a trip already planned that i spent 10s of hours putting together which i cannot view anymore unless i upgrade to premium.

I understand when services beed to go up but this is not the way to it. I did reach out to customer support to atleast be able to view my trip that i already created so i can copy it down or something which they refused, 

unbelievable! | I had used this app before and signed up for the trial to test it out again. Meh. Frustrated that the expensive annual subscription went through a week later with no courtesy reminder or anything. I know this is how they get your money, but it’s really soured me on the app. I’d be much more happy to give them my money if it was a monthly subscription so there was a lower buy-in for short trips. | I absolutely LOVE this app (and the desktop website). I could go on and on.l about it. I’ve used it to plan out three mega road trips for me and my boys and without RoadTrippers, my drive would have been boring and predictable.

If I had just used Google maps I would’ve stopped at a theme park, a zoo, maybe an overlook. Instead we found an insane and unknown rock formation, the actual grave of Dr. Pepper, a tiny military museum in a tiny town, a parrot sanctuary and a trail of cherry blossoms in peak bloom.

I love that you can collaborate with others that aren’t premium members. I love adding stops along my trips and having the driving/mileage info for each stop. I love seeing reviews and photos within the app so I don’t have to go googling. I love it all.

I got my mom onto the app and now she has used it twice as well to plan a regular road trip and an RV road trip. Apparently, the app shows where RV hookups are and is a dream for traveling with an RV.

Never going anywhere without checking this app first!! | Don't try to use this while you're driving you'll get a wreck | The features of the service were nice and very helpful for planning a trip, the real problem is the ridiculous subscription plans. When they first switched to a subscription based model it wasn’t great but it is a helpful app and supporting the developers is total fine, so we were fine with it. Recently they’ve updated the plans again without notice, and has locked us out of almost all of our trips that we had already planned (with no way of accessing them other than to buy a new subscription model). Finally just switched to google maps because it’s free and can save our trips without fear of no being able to access them. | You have to pay and you can only pay annually. | Stop the spam!!!! | Stopped along my route at a wayside rest area.  Without touching the phone, it then rerouted us back 14 miles onto a route that was about 100 miles longer.  Sorry I ever subscribed | Seems fairly straightforward and intuitive. Still early but I like it. | I’ve had this app on my iPhone (fairly new iPhone) for about an hour and it’s already crashed a dozen times. Every time I try to put in a destination it locks up. Add RV info it locks, try to open up to see what the annual fee is and it locks up. Every time I have to completely close it down and start over. I tried reloading the app and it does the same thing. I’m going to play with it a little more but if this is how it works I certainly won’t be buying the upgrade or recommend it to anyone
Update: after removing the app and reinstalling it, it’s just as bad as before. | Luckily I caught it before our trip, but this app completely messed up our trip from California to Vancouver. In fact, don't bother with this app if you're going to Canada at all. I spent, not hours, but days meticulously planning a 3 week roadtrip. Only to realize that this app's routes become incomprehensible north of Seattle. | Really enjoying the app so far. But noticed that there’s no option to select French cuisine for travel. Also, for hotel stays, would be great if we can search by hotel brands. | Unable to choose from different routes. Like the ability to find hotels and campsites. | I entered my trip destination and get a blue line indicating the route but it covers over the interstate designation. Major interstate highways are marked and coveted over but no other roads or highways are indicated. When the route has a change from interstate to state, county, other, roads theres no designation as to what road it is. I tried zooming but that was no help. Since I'm not provided a navigational list this app is really of no help to properly get me safely to my destination. So tell me whats the big deal with this app? | You make it impossible to stop renewal you only want to keep my money. The only way I can find to stop the renewal is to cancel what I have paid for. Not good | gotta get a subscription for more than one place on the route bruh | Turn by turn directions are inconsistent and  not enough lead time to make turns.   Does not appear to be Apple phone compatible | I find it difficult to use! | This was acceptable at $30/mth for access to 3 different apps, but when you only camp 6 times a year for it to double its cost for the same functionality, then tier off the value of the app with functions that brought you to the app in the first place is just price gouging. | This is a really good app. Definitely recommend it. Mostly an easy way to put a trip together, plan stops, construct a map. I would give it 5 stars except for a few very frustrating things that drag this app down. And could easily be fixed. I do understand that maybe it’s user error, but … When you are on a trip, you open the trip and it goes to your current location in Map View. However, when you open the List View for that trip, why doesn’t it go to your current location instead of starting from day one and you have to scroll all the way down until you find what you’re looking for. The way dates are managed is a complete nightmare. Changing the dates of an entire trip is such a hassle. And you cannot plan a trip without dates as once you add your first date, the app puts every single waypoint on a separate date!! Who thought that was a good idea?! You can add things that are not on the map already, but you can only add an address, you cannot label the address as to what it is. There are a lot of things that are not included on the map that I would like to add to my trips. And label with a name. This app is not a standalone app. You need other sources to complete the picture. Especially because there is a blue line indicating your route that completely covers up the highway numbers. Highway numbers are essential to trip planning. Also, can you update the gas pricing? It’s no where near accurate. And organize the trips into past and upcoming/future? | G Maps and this nav system come up with  same routes which is not conducive for RVs.  The previous togo rv nav system was way better | Not easy to start navigation - ridiculously hard to do. | Interesting app. Paid the $60 fee and used it for a single road trip. Was pretty useful at setting up driving routes and ranges, similar to the old AAA TripTik. Found some good restaurants and museums along the way. 

But it has mediocre UI/UX. It dumps a bunch of OTHER people’s road adventures into the place where you store yours. Whenever you open it, you have to go digging for the trip(s) you’re working on because Roadtrippers figures you more likely want to see what others have done in an area you aren’t even visiting and that’s more important than your own trip! 

Think about asking a friend to hand you your hammer and instead they hand you random other tools in your box until eventually your hammer shows up. And they repeat that over and over. Wouldn’t be relying on that friend for help, even worse if I were paying them. And that’s how I feel about the experience of Roadtrippers- $60 a year to have it throwing up random adventures from other people when I bought it to focus on my own trip(s) is absurd. I can find plenty of these types of stories in more detail on YouRube or other websites- I’m paying for this subscription for a “professional” tool that focuses on MY road trips. Far too much noise and clunky navigation. 

The reason it went from a 3-star experience to a 1-star rating: apparently it’s rigged to make it impossible or near impossible to turn off the subscription. You follow a link from the app to log into their website, go to “manage subscription” or “turn off auto renewal,” and it takes you to yet again ANOTHER website for a company called “Stripe.” And does “Stripe” let you manage your subscription or turn off auto renewal? NOPE. Stripe wants you to put in your email and they claim they will “send a link” so you can log in. And the link is good for 30 minutes. BUT- the link never arrives. Tried it twice. So, Roadpass/tripper and Stripe have apparently designed a rat trap where they can claim to let you turn off auto renewal, but there is no way to do so. 

Come the end of my subscription and if they try charging again, it’ll be an instant chargeback with my bank. These sorts of schemes need to be called out for the fraud they are. And Apple may need to be advised this is going on behind the scenes, even though it’s a useful app, the trickery in preventing cancellation is abhorrent. | I was on auto renew. The price last year was 29.99 for unlimited plans with unlimited stops. It renewed for 35.99. Five more dollars, OK. But for three trips with 20 stops each. All the trios except for one have a lock sign on them, so the app isn’t even registering that I am a paying customer. There was no notice or email that the plan was changing. And of course no refunds. Will NOT be renewing | Used this app for the first time and it DID NOT take us to our Destination. Don’t trust it now and won’t use it again. Good thing my Trailer is on the small side or I would have had issues. | Killer app just learn how to used this app and it is worth every penny | This is annoying. I have logged out and logged back into my account but cannot see the trip I created on my desktop computer through the phone app. The phone app is not recognizing my user name or email and will not allow me to update it. Spent $60 on the annual membership for the premium package. | roadtrippers and campendium are supposed to be merged, but there is no campendium info here. | Very hard to understand what you actually have access to. Tried to sign up for all 4 apps but found out I only got Roadtrippers not Togo and Campendium like I wanted
Dallas Willard | Seems like developers might have forgotten about this project? I put in a 1,200 mile road trip and it couldn’t find a single gas station, a single hotel, almost anything really. It found 3 major historic land marks that almost everyone in the world has heard of… so whats the point of this app then? And you want people to pay for something as well? It’s scary to see junk like this being advertised. Seriously, I feel like i’m living in the movie idiocracy sometimes. | Wow, I couldn’t even figure out how to use this app before I ran out of free tries and they wanted me to pay for the upgrade. Why do they assume you want to plan a trip starting from your house? I wanted to find out what things there were to do once I leave Austin on my way to Marfa in a couple of months. It kept putting my current location there and wouldn’t let me search between two points any other way. That’s how I lost all my free whatever they called them. Boo for this app. They don’t even explain how to use it properly! Nowhere at all do they explain me what I need to do. Going to delete it from my device!",4.64839,58904,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/39/21/6a/39216a7a-62c9-769a-14f1-646a542e3470/db767308-f79e-4a71-8720-d577012636ee_AppStore_SS_iPhone_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/41/d0/dc/41d0dce2-6206-fe76-9910-3657284e17ba/70f2abc4-cef7-464b-a27a-acd34a4e1526_AppStore_SS_iPhone_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/12/00/52/1200523f-c011-c13f-5643-bcbcdc1409bb/216fa624-676b-46ec-8868-4c81e706e624_AppStore_SS_iPhone_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/61/35/66/6135669d-79e6-5a09-e358-0b363e05791f/3f48ef0d-d3f7-4378-9afa-5627ea64e682_AppStore_SS_iPhone_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2f/1d/5d/2f1d5d72-5078-a31d-578d-bb3f3b3d4ba6/d3119d00-2327-4651-9873-c1c97695762b_AppStore_SS_iPhone_05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/eb/16/10/eb161041-f7bc-351c-8d57-b733591711e7/8f81a9ab-56cf-4fb7-a592-08c9c5932a5b_AppStore_SS_iPhone_06.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6e/4b/95/6e4b958d-b197-0231-a608-32006b6a02b9/7c807b90-32d2-4ec0-aaf2-892c6d2772d4_AppStore_SS_iPhone_07.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/24/f4/05/24f40598-b82e-d075-2e1a-1d9df14fedfb/5a02c4c0-1990-49f3-988b-98d7eabbebe1_AppStore_SS_iPhone_08.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/26/e7/47/26e74752-527d-2030-7466-c94cbf31316b/78336ff5-b577-4c8f-b0a0-e12cc5c5ebb0_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_01.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/de/2b/84/de2b843c-29bb-78f4-53b7-8fc59e25e0ca/da334249-1ce7-4a7d-8cdd-0d4fe8653843_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_02.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/50/01/99/50019906-25ce-8f4f-4ea6-787a695f94af/95bc4514-fbfb-4b95-ad42-4c81118d7dcd_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_03.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c6/7f/b3/c67fb383-2bf1-1217-f17a-d9df4c0652d0/f50a3dd9-761c-43a3-b5bb-f302572c91ff_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_04.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/df/43/51/df4351f1-10a5-8417-ebb0-32e060bbf8c2/5fdc7054-4e11-41ef-a18c-dd23df735736_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_05.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a0/9d/69/a09d69ce-163d-b4e3-5f73-a8bd646aec07/163b3d55-e773-4d35-a199-750188fe2a74_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_07.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2d/8d/d1/2d8dd1f3-6ff0-422d-35f2-492d8367ea77/16833734-9815-4911-9702-88a5557d25c8_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_08.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPa

We enjoyed every moment. She was knowledgeable, fun and delight to be with!!! 
Totally enjoyed it all!! | I use this app for all my trips, personal and work. I type in the place, it gives a history of the location and things to do or restaurants to try. I’ve used it for Berlin, Milan, Key West, Denver and more. | Had a marvelous time.. The hotel accommodation were truly a five star experience.  Upon our arrival the smiles were warm and welcoming. The staff provided us with transportation immediately upon request and breakfast was outstanding. This was our first experience in South East Asia and truly left a lasting impression. | It was a wonderful excursion. We enjoyed all of it. From the mountain views to the monastery it was all an experience. | Great tour to Mt. Rainier. Stopped at a number of sites. Our guide Cory was great! | We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the Vatican with Ella of LivTours!   She was warm, friendly and very knowledgeable with history, art appreciation, and religion (and has a background in archeology!).  If you can afford to go with a small group, do it!  We felt our small group tour was very personal, very pleasant and extremely informative. We saw so many large groups, and we could see the experience was not the same. | This hotel was top of the line for courteous and friendly personnel. The grounds and interior were immaculate and the relaxing atmosphere made the stay outstanding. The choices of food and drinks at the various eateries on site allowed us to enjoy the amenities and not have to leave to locate great dining elsewhere. It was worth every cent we spent. We took home wonderful memories of our experiences here. | I used to love Trip Advisor, but oh how the mighty has fallen.  When I’m trying to find things to do in any given town, sadly I am insistently shown tours and guides, rather than location information.  Tripadvisor is merely a platform for trying to get me to book a tour through them rather than a guide to help me find what I actually wanna see in a particular place.    Their “Things to do” section has become woefully disappointing. On my recent trip to Portugal, Tripadvisor did not really advise me at all. I ended up looking at where the tours took me what they included to figure out exactly where I wanted to go, and then used my Maps program to find out where they were with no help from Tripadvisor. 
Andy The Traveler | i want the old TA BACK!!! | Looking on planning a trip have used this site many times they’re always very good so I’m writing a little review. The past has been pretty good now. We’ll see what happens this next time.,, | Trip Advisor is my favorite way to plan our adventures—in town or away.  

The information is non-biased and accurately describes the various options for dining, lodging and entertainment | I want to especially think the front desk team, Nikhil and Jee for making our stay comfortable and inviting! Nikhil and Jee corrected an issue that we had with our room. This is what makes customer service a satisfying experience. This property used to be a Marriott. Now that it is a Hilton property I’m continually satisfied. | Matteo is a wonderful historian and a great Guide. I recommend using Matteo and
Crown tours to make your stay fun 
and interesting. | Good tour with the right balance of quality and quantity. Could have spent more time at El Escorial but covered most highlights given the time constraints. Valley of the Fallen was a nice side trip that we would not have done on our own. Christiana our guide was excellent. Gave a good balanced commentary about topics that may have political sensitivity. Worth the time and money if you have seen the highlights in Madrid. | Utterly amazed to discover this treasure of artifacts, tables, stools and benches, straight from the wood artisans themselves.  Incredible prices including shipping to the states. I now have 4 beautiful souvenirs from Bali that I will cherish for years. | If you like to cook and learn new cuisines, you’ll love this class.  I’m a chef and enjoyed the experience. It’s a small class (max. 8) and you get a full experience (prepping & cooking) with a market tour of the ingredients you will use during class.  Instructor is friendly, engaging and gives step-by-step guidance in the preparation and cooking of several courses.  You also get a recipe book in print and electronically at the end of class; AND a video of your experience.  Great memory to have.   Transportation: Our driver Dewa was also very nice.  I mentioned something I wanted to find and he took me to a place I could get it. | Trip Advisor is helpful in providing us the best vendors and experiences in our travels based on experience and reviews of others.  TA Takes the unknown out of the selection process.  Thank you. | This was a really chic hotel right in the middle of everything. Young professionals everywhere and excellent accommodations and service. | Not to be missed! It was absolutely wonderful! | This is a great app - other than for whatever reason the people who design the app think it’s a great idea to not let people filter reviews by date (most recent).  I don’t care about reviews that happened two years ago when there are obviously more recent reviews and I’m not interested in reading through 250 reviews to find the most recent.  And by the way, the “last 3 months” doesn’t work.  I tried it and the search result was one review from 11 months ago, even though there was a more recent review.  Please fix this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | This is a great museum for the Merkel, Texas area.  The exhibits include school memorabilia, local police, veterans, and more.  It is well worth the visit!  Just off I-20.  Willie the docent is knowledgeable and friendly with museum visitors. | Just had such an incredible experience skydiving with Skydive Kauai! Dave, the owner, Ben and Taylor, the professional tandem divers, and the pilot were all amazing and so helpful and friendly!! This was in my bucket list and I am so glad I chose to do it in Kauai! The views were spectacular!!! | Delicious food.  Winston was my waiter and he was very helpful with my dinner selection.  Cesar salad was actually a meal as it had grilled chicken in it.  The lasagne was my main entree and I could only eat half!  Would highly recommend this restaurant and Winston! | As a well traveled person, and having once had the function of displaying countries visited on the site, it’s disappointing to see its no longer available. Odd that TA cant incorporate more of Google or at least parts of the world, to allow feedback and reviews.  Over half the towns in Africa I’ve been to, aren’t “allowed” on TA. 
Time to do the full switch to google it appears | The food was not fresh or hot, and they just covered the chicken and brisket with BBQ sauce. The cheddar grits were good. The collard greens were not cooked long enough with no seasoning. | @RACHEDTOHME  #rachedtohme | Combined with a very educational windmill tour, this was a fantastic time for a great price.  Bonus … there was wine. | We had a very nice breakfast at St Regis.  Always delicious food and the service makes the brunch all the better.  Our server was Fahmy and he was very attentive and made sure we had an amazing breakfast.  Definitely recommend | Great coffee, milkshakes and fruit juices. Smoothies to die for! The staff (Antonio, Dominga, Ismael, Olga, Yenny and Neveida) are ALL super attentive to every whim and need! Even brought my 13 year old behind the bar to mix his own special fruit drink! | Sam was a great guide today! She knows all the hot spots to find shark teeth and fossils. Shes very knowledgeable and can tell you what everything is that you find. 

Would highly recommend taking this day tour! | Am amazing, wonderful, relaxing, staff friendly and accommodating that go above and beyond your expectations kind OD resort. Super clean and plenty to drink and eat all day. Food was particularly very good abcs still prepared every. Definitely will be back! | Using Trip Advisor is a great way to ease your mind when traveling. It is user friendly and offers a plethora of options such as food, activities, lodging, etc. when you are traveling. Trip advisor also makes it easy to write reviews and post pictures. Great app to have for any  expert traveller and your beginner traveller. | Leider versuchen wir unser Geld zurück zu erhalten . Da die Leistung nicht erbracht wurde. 
Nun sieht es so aus das wir geblockt werden und auch unsere Bewertung wurde gelöscht . Das ist alles andere als seriös. 
Wir sind wirklich enttäuscht, denn das war ein Geburtstagsgeschenk . | We had Andres as our waiter and he was excellent and served us a wonderful meal at the grill.  
The meal was  very tasty and the flavors were authentic very unique | Waste of time to leave legit reviews. TA likes to remove reviews or reject them. You cannot leave an honest to goodness bad review anymore it seems. No matter how bad a place may seem. | The Parc Bistro on 5th Ave. has a magical feel when you enter and glance down a long neighborhood bar bustling with people and great food. Farò the owner has been in the restaurant business for 30 years I know of. He is warm, friendly and serves wonderful French food. The best dishes and has an extensive wine list. The monthly wine dinners with a winery rep there to discuss their wines are a sellout! Live music weekly and reasonable prices. | Rahul server was excellent…. Very attentive and polite !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great view of burj Khalifa fountains …….,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, great service …. Food very tasty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super nice hostes gave us the best service here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Big selections on the menu food and drinks . Music is amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Friendly environment all over . Feels like home for sure | The app is completely broken, even after updating the app, logging out, logging back in… can’t see any pictures, can’t change my profile picture or see it, can’t share or view itineraries… completely useless now. | Amazing !!!! The Sicilian pie !!!! You won’t be disappointed !! | We stopped at Verona after a yacht trip. Marlon was very attentive and gave excellent recommendations. Everyone was satisfied with their meals. I would recommend. | Never have seen such tight slots.
Our host complained we were not playing much, so we said, your slots are to tight 

Lost a lot of money and made zero

Will visit other Caesars and other states, but not sure I’m gonna be back to Vegas anytime soon | Found the Baixamar seafood restaurant from a recommendation of our hotel desk clerk. The meal was by far the best we experienced on our entire vacation. If you like fresh seafood definitely get the seafood platter for two. Well worth the $ and flavors. | I stay here twice and both times was amazing the guy at the front desk I think his name is siyani but he was the best I’ll stay there a 3 time just off how siyani made me feel | Galo was above and beyond,, dinner was delicious but the service was even better 

We have been coming since 2012 and it’s our favorite spot and experience 

Must try you won’t be sorry ask for Galo | No matter what country I am in any excursion I booked with trip I know it’s a guarantee good time. | I use it to navigate places while on vacation and write reviews as I go. | I always use trip advisor anytime I go somewhere new | The outdoor seating area is by far the best outdoor atmosphere in the Upstate! The indoor area is quirky and unique too and the food is always delicious, the service is consistently great and the menu is more interesting and diverse than most places within hundreds of miles. Whether you’re going for happy hour and appetizers or an amazing lunch or dinner, I can assure you that you won’t be disappointed! | This is one of the best trail rides I have been on. Zip Lining in morning and trail riding in afternoon.  Great day and place. Everyone is pleasant. | Wintered at the Resort 2024, wonderful experience.  Met very friendly neighbors, lots of activities and monthly special dinners and desserts prepared by volunteer residents. The office ladies, Nancy, Brenda and Michelle, were all very welcoming and helpful. Marissa was my contact for any maintenance or housekeeping needs.  Wonderful young lady, very knowledgeable, could answer any question I had.  Very helpful. 
I rented a “Park model”, lot 93, which is absolutely beautiful! 
Completely stocked with everything you will need, just bring your clothes and your toothbrush!

It’s very easy to use, and the directions they give are detailed and helpful. 

When I used it for my last event, I wasn’t sure if I was at the correct location, I reached out to their team via WhatsApp  and  they replied back to me in less then two minutes.

I will use this app any time I travel abroad ! | This app has completely changed my stress level when planning a trip. It tells me what to see, how to see it, and allows me to put in places I want to see and it will tell me which day its most convenient. | I’ve used Viator for Paris, Seattle, London, Dublin, Boston and more! It’s my GO-TO travel app when I don’t want to miss a thing!!! | It’s about the feeling of belonging. Knowing it’s all going to be ok once you check in. 
The smiles of the personnel, the ambiance, the environment. 
Everything is so cool! | Great app for planning the trip without missing the most important sights and ajustable to your travel length | I love this app.  It truly makes planning a visit to a city EASY!!!  I love how it builds the itinerary based on your timeframe.  Some things i wills look to see as enhancements:
1.  Allow download of plans to be used offline
2.  Allow user to default start times for specific itinerary items
3.  Allow users to select method of going from one point to another (eg. allow me to self walk if i won’t want public transportation)

App is a must have!!!! | I like my privacy thru require you to be tracked through Facebook google and others not just use while using the app  I unstalled fast! | Needs a blurb about each city before the onslaught of tours. I need some insider information - the essentials - about the city, history, weather, geography, best time to go, events, landmarks. I want to read some information before diving into tours. I know they need to monetize the app, but it feels like advertising. | This app can’t seems to find almost any hotels, either by name or by address. | Wish you could add “breaks” in the app like you can on the website also Need to be able to add different hotels on the same itinerary other than that- Make’s planning multi day trips so easy when you have a lot you need to get in and can’t waste time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank you. | It’s a good apps for the trips. I suggest to add direct links to the monuments | We have used this app on several trips in the past couple years.  It is wonderful!!  With the maps, day by day itineraries, and suggestions, we’ve been able to navigate our way through London, Athens, Paris, and now we’re using it to help plan our trip to Rome!  It’s a lifesaver!! | Spinning wheel forever. Worst app in the age of chatgpt | I’ve been using the app for 10 years, I travel A LOT, I adjust times, dates and activities and attractions w easy. Usually I am the lead in my groups and people are always so impressed and satisfied. I set activities that are near eachother for same day, usually hitting one region or area per day. Very seldeom I use public transport, usually all by foot and the map option allows me to plan accordingly. | I have used it all over the world, very good and helpful | The program works well, but I was unable to figure out how to list more than one hotel and use the app to plot which sites to see from each hotel site. Also 10 days is maximum. Limited in allowing you to travel between different cities on the same trip. Nice listings of attractions close to each other and offers a variety of itineraries to adapt to your plans. | Very versatile, flexible, you just choose a city and you have many options to plan accordingly. | Joan did a spectacular tour. His knowledge and perspective of both the city’s history and local color made Barcelona come alive. I definitely recommend this tour and Joan. 25 stars! | That’s the review.. just got a blanked out screen on iPhone. Tried on android the same.. bummer | This app constantly forces you back to the beginning. You’re on day one, every time you go into it you going to go through plan your trip, your plans and then sometimes it’s not your plans but the generic guide they give you constantly reloading.  In your travels this can get really expensive. Also there used to be an offline downloadable map which was amazing. | This app is amazing and it’s a staple for all of my trips. One problem is adding a stop the app doesn’t recognize. I wish we could add an address if the app doesn’t recognize it as a destination. | Freezes constantly. Every few seconds! | I consistently recommend this app to anyone I meet that tells me they are traveling to a new city! It’s incredibly easy to use and flexible. You are sure to optimize your time using it to see top attractions anywhere in the world! | I was thrilled to find this helpful site and even happier with the intuitive way it works.  I have reworked our week in London a couple times and it was easy peesy!  😊 | After long hours of working on my itinerary, I then tried to download and print.   Though it said it had emailed the itinerary to my email address, it never did.   There is no print option, when you select print it just says it emailed it.    Not what I had hoped for. | I’ve used this all over the world, whether on vacation or a short business trip. Best way to be efficient and knowledgeable! | What a great place to start your planning for any trip. Offers such a variety of options and how to pace yourself. | I like the concept, but to get started it’s not user friendly. One I remember how to input everything it’s smoother | One of my favorite travel apps! | The best app ever.  It help me travelled around the world.  Everyone should have it | Truly a phenomenal idea and an amazing app. Thanks to the team. Great job. | I rate this the BEST guide to plan for visits to  any city ! It is very time- saving to visitors! | This | Friendly use | I used it in Italy, New Orleans, San Francisco and more.  It’s awesome.  Saw so much more than I would have been able to with out its direction.  Signed up for tours I never would have known about.  Fabulous! | I have used this program several son the last couple of years.  I love its ability suggest itineraries to Mach the available to see the sites | Fantastic app and I’ve used it to organize and maximize many trips regardless of how long my visit will be! | Nice concept but you need to do a lot of work on this app or website. Can not edit your travel itinerary or move your plans from one day to another.
Can not add “things to do” from the tab into the itinerary, sends you to another site. | this app is so useful and helps so much when seeing a new place especially when it gives you a map overview of all the attractions | Love this app for city planning. | I have been looking for an app to track my trips and add places that I would like to go. This app gives me ideas by setting up itineraries for me and allows me to adjust them to fit my needs. One thing that I would like to see is the ability to change the actual times. We made reservations for dinner and I may I am not able to change the time for that particular item without adjusting the length of the time I’m at other places. | I’m just gonna say it—the interface is kind of trash! There’s a lot of functions that would be nice, convenient, and rational to have that aren’t there, and if they ARE there, they’re not intuitive to find at all. It also gives me clunky mapquest vibes. 
But—if you like trip planning, it definitely gives you that satisfied feeling once you have your itinerary all filled out. Also, after seeing the website, the app looks a lot better. Happy traveling! | This app has been a godsend for our large family, as we have been traveling in Europe! It is a first rate idea generator, even suggesting a sensible itinerary. Not only that, but when we had difficulty with tickets from a vendor the app listed, the Cisit a City customer service stepped up to get us a refund. Exceeded my expectations! | I love looking at Visit-a-City to identify the sites in a particular location. And I have been able to find some great tours and activities to book. | We use visitacity to map out our trips.  It p provides  an easy to follow itinerary.  If you are a planner, this is the App for you. You will not be disappointed. | I love this app!I have used it for international multi country trips as well as trips within the USA. You put in the where and when and your planning is almost done for you!  I would highly recommend this app for anyone traveling whether you have kids, want to relax or go and see everything! | I admit I found it much easier to use website to plan the trip then the app.  I tried tons of travel planners and this is the best site.  Once you have the plan done, you can share it or for me being old school, I printed it for a hard copy.  There are areas it can improve on, but compared to other apps, this easy.

I had to email them with a technical support and they were awesome.  Download it and give it a try, but remember the website is easier to do the initial plan.  5 stars me is odd, but this app deserves it. | This app is awesome!

Unfortunately it would never connect and kept giving me the connecting circle of death that didn’t go anywhere. I contacted tech support and am still awaiting a response 4 weeks now and counting. | I packed everything more quickly than usual and I didn’t forget anything. Will keep using it | I travel a few times per year so I am not a huge traveler. But I did not find this app user friendly. Maybe it just didn’t suit my needs but I’m not impressed. | It has lists that auto populate based on the length of your stay, weather, etc but I really want to just attach my own things in addition, reservations, activities, restaurants. Maybe I just don’t understand this app. And it has nothing to explain it | Not $3, but $3 a month. Super annoying setup where you can just start making a list, you have to put in dates, destinations, and type of trip. I’m looking for a packing list app that lets me input my own lists. Keep it simple. | I’ve been using this app for many years and I’ve been very happy. I only use it once or twice a year and it was free before. I don’t mind paying to keep the app but now it’s wanting me to pay $20 a year. I would be happy to pay $20 just to have the app forever but there’s no way I’m going to pay that every year.I’m very disappointed because I really liked this app | This app told me to bring a scarf to Disneyland this weekend. It’s not going to be cold enough. You need to change your app and only tell people to bring a scarf when it’s below freezing. | Very basic packing list. It is good to include power adapters, health insurance card, but neglects things like an umbrella, hat and jacket and small scissors. Also …for a long trip it suggested 15 shirts …which is ridiculous. I take no more than 5 shirts even if going for months. Clothes can be washed. 
I don’t see any reason to pay for this app. It’s ok I suppose if you don’t already have a packing list of your own. There are many better packing lists for free on websites. | The way the ads appear and they way the interact (close ads overlap, etc), the app is unusable. | Used to be great. Now it’s just ads. How can an app about packing have so many ads? It’s insane. They also deleted all my old packing lists, so I can’t even reference those. Time to find another app. | I downloaded it and immediately opening the app my phone was overloaded with ads inside the app. Absolutely do not like this app at all | I recommend this app to everyone. I particularly hate packing because it’s so stressful, but the customized activity lists make packing a breeze. | Don’t like being forced to watch an ad to use the app | If dobt get premium sibscriptions doesnt seem like you can do much | Update: After using this for a weekend trip, this may not be the app for me. It is extremely frustrating that every time I open the app, it prompts me for an update. However, the App Store does not have an update.

But then all my lists keep getting put out of alphabetical order. This is annoying to find to check out and try to pack. Then items will be added to a person when creating a trip and it is not on the list that I have so where did it come from?

I will be looking for about her app.

———————————————

I am searching for a good packing list. While this one is okay, it is frustrating. I have spent all day trying to load it up with our trips and it is just not user friendly. It is constantly putting my lists out of alphabetical order. So for me to sort it manually within each list and trip is just annoying. I also wish that I could easily remove a person from a trip and changing from multi-trip to single when duplicating a trip. | Updating my review because now there’s offline mode. Great app! | This app makes it so easy to put together a list for packing. As someone who struggles to stay organized, this app helps so much with providing suggested items per planned activity. SO much better than trying to make sure I think of everything on my own. I undoubtedly will either forget something or overpack planning it on my own. | This app is extremely helpful. It customizes your packing lists for the weather at your destination (and can update this). It also customizes it for your planned activities and duration of stay. It is a great way to make sure that you have what you need and don’t forget anything. it is by far the best list of this sort that I have encountered. The only small improvement I might suggest is for long trips on which you will be washing every few days, it would be helpful if you could specify the number of days between each washing so that the app knew what to recommend for packing. Nevertheless, it does a great job. | I’ve never used another tool, but this one has everything I need — pre-built lists, weather forecast and the ability to customize. Love it! | I have used Packr on iPhone and iPad for years. I did not realize there was a Mac app until recently so I downloaded it.

I have tried different packing list apps and packing list methods over the years including a spreadsheet, Notes, a Word document, and other packing list apps. I even tried Macsparky's Reminders packing list idea. I always come back to Packr. Why have I tried other apps if I like Packr? Because I like to try new apps! But I will not stray again. Packr just works for me. I ike that I can make different lists for different needs for different trips and reuse them over and over. 

Thank you for a great app! | I created my trip, selected the categories and when I submitted to continue, it gave me the option to either pay $3/mo or $20/yr for premium or watch an ad. I opted for the ad, because I hadn’t gotten far enough into the app to know if I like it. The full screen, 10-second ad counted down but then it was done, the ad wouldn’t close! The little “x” was there in the top right corner but it didn’t work. I closed and relaunched the app twice, re-created the trip (because it wasn’t saved), and the same thing happened. I could have written out my entire packing list on paper in the time I wasted trying to make this app work. So disappointed. | This app is great, and it just keeps getting better. It works wonderful for multi city vacations or just quick getaways. One of my favorite features is saving customizable list. This allows me to have specialists for each of my trip needs, from camping in the mountains to water sports at the lake. Plus I can add my personalized photo to the top of the trip. | Used to be able to create a new default list with icons to choose.  Not saving new lists or adding an icon.  I thought you could add more than one trip photo. Can't find information on a huge venue tourist site in a city. | I like the concept of Packr but one major flaw. I want it to automatically sync between my iPad and my iPhone. All my other apps automatically sync (icloud) but it appears this has to be manually synced every time you make a change. Very inefficient. | I wanted to try out the app to see how it worked. No matter what activity I chose it pushed the buy-pro. I deleted the app. If you can’t give it a test run to see how you like it, I’ll try another app | My devices have separate apps and don’t load the same trips. It would be nice if they would sync and have the same trips. Is there a profile? Not even seeing a way to log in. | Been a premium user for a while. Really wanted to love it because I travel for work a ton and need customized packing lists. This app has so many bugs and I am tired of items not showing up in lists I create, or reverting back to old lists after being updated. The idea is great but the execution is just not there. | Use basically every trip | Very basic app for the price | After creating your trip, you’re met with a full screen advertisement that can’t be closed even after the allotted time. The X button is unresponsive. | I purchased Packr Premium several years ago and absolutely love it. I had a problem when I deleted this app off of my iPad and thought I had lost all my lists, but the developer fixed it within a day. I use this app for all of my trips because I love the weather forecasts which help me know how to pack. I also have saved customized packing list for different activities like backpacking or international travel. I have recommended this app to several travel buddies who were green with envy when they saw all it could do. If you travel, it’s worth every penny. | I was packing for Coachella and this made my life so much easier because I was dealing with a health problem that made me very uncomfortable and not feel like myself. A month or so in advance, I was brainstorming things I wanted to pack and had come up with a preliminary list. Then as I was packing for the few days before leaving for the trip, I was adding as I went. Finally I finished everything on my list and I didn’t know what else to bring. I had to sleep and then leave in 6 hours lol. It was great!! I didn’t forget anything. 

I really like the layout of this app. Sometimes it can get confusing with lists and removing stuff in lists it asks you if you want it removed forever, i just ignore them and it seems to work out fine since i dont really need to pack for trips that frequently. It works well for when you want an app that’s not your Notes or Reminders app | This app is my CONSTANT GO TO to help me with my business and pleasure travels!
THANK YOU for being such an AWESOME APP!!!!!!!! | I’ve several other packing list apps and have settled on Packr. It just does packing lists and does it really well. I highly recommend it. Also their tech support is awesome. | Can’t get passed the first add. The X is so far off the edge you can’t close the add. 
USELESS GARBAGE. | You can’t get to the packing list.  Watch an ad that allows you to advance but the button to advance to the list page doesn’t work.  Honestly, it’s an app that tells you how many pairs of socks you should bring on a 3 day trip, why the ads?  Delete immediately. | it crashes on my macbook. too bad. I had used in the past | I am a very heavy packer. Though I’m still this way, this app has helped me improve greatly. It’s very cool how it tells you the number of things to bring like socks, and shirts, gives you the ability to add things and tailors needs to the weather forecast…which it also has. It’s been 5-Starts since I bought it and has continued to be with updated and new features added | Do not download. Interface commonly crashes and though it is ad centric, the ads are coded in such a way as not to allow access through once viewed. Lists aren’t generated. | Do not have what I need | It might just be me. I love the app, but I’m not sure how I see the other family members I added. How do I see the list for my son? | This app thinks of everything. You tell it where you’re going and for how long and it gives you the most thoughtful packing list ever. It thinks of every single thing you may need for your trip! I highly recommend it!! | The new version makes you pay to even make a list anymore. The old didn’t. BAD. Try Packing List: Trip Planner instead. | Greatest app of all humanity for packing! | I can’t print my list.  The option is there, but it closes the app and doesn’t bring up a list. This doesn’t help me. If you want to carry your phone while you pack, this may be fine. | App crashed and I lost my $4.99 for the upgrade to premium. | I use this app for every trip I take!   Perfectly organized and easy to use!   The only reason I gave four stars is because the local  attractions are not so local!   A trip to the Bahamas brings me activities to do near Greece! | Premium in app purchase doesn’t share with family, I bought it and thought my wife could share it with 1 purchase. Not fair and the sharing feature isn’t explained well. | I love this app for packing lists. I have used TripIt for a couple years for keeping track of travel info. This works well with that to help me prep and pack for those trips. I’m he suggested lists consider weather and what I will be doing (after I make selections) to make the list very practical. I can also add my own notes and modify the list as I see fit. I also love the ability to share a list. I’m his has been helpful for my husband and me as we can just check that app and make updates (instead of assuming the other grabbed it or grabbing double.)

An essential tool for global expats, digital nomads, permanent residents, dual residents, overseas homeowners, and frequent travellers.

AUTO TRIP RECORDING
With geolocation tracking, Flamingo automatically determines if you have left your residence country or state and accurately records your trip details so that you don’t have to. Keep tabs on the countries and states you’ve visited and how many days you spent there.

SCHENGEN AREA CALCULATOR
If you frequently travel to the EU Schengen Travel Area as a non-resident, it can be a hassle to keep up with the 90 in 180 days rule. Flamingo counts how many combined days you’ve already spent in Schengen countries and how many more you have left in the 180-day period. If you’re already located in the EU as a non-resident, Flamingo tells you the date when you have to leave to avoid overstaying.
The built-in calculator helps you determine not only the earliest date you can travel to the EU for your desired number of days, but also for how many days you can stay if you arrive on your desired date.

VISA-FREE STAY
Based on your citizenship, Flamingo automatically identifies to which countries you need a visa, e-visa, or visa on arrival and where you can travel absolutely visa-free.
Coming soon: Flamingo will also tell you how long you can stay in each country visa-free, monitor your duration of stay and alert you when you’ll be close to overstaying.

RESIDENCE STATUS FOR COUNTRIES & US STATES
Flamingo helps you determine your physical presence for domicile and residency by automatically recording and counting how many days you spend there.
*Especially useful for Statutory Residence Test for UK expats and Substantial and Physical Presence Tests for US expats and permanent residents.

EXPORT REPORTS
You can download a customizable CSV report with your travel details with the tap of a button. Share it with authorities and lawyers in seconds or keep it for your own travel records. 

COMPLETE PRIVACY
Your travel, residency, and visa data is stored locally only on your device. We do not collect, nor store, your information on our servers. 
*With Flamingo PRO you can sync your data via iCloud across all your devices.

***Flamingo tracking and counting are created for information purposes only. Always consult with your legal advisor about specific requirements for your residency and visa status.

Would now need to go back and update the timeline manually. 

The core value proposition of the app doesn’t work. | We investigated numerous apps for tracking travel and residency, and one app clearly stood out. We have a complex situation involving time spent in numerous countries and several US states. This app's intuitive design simplifies what could be a complex and distracting tracking process—it has been a big stress reducer, to say the least. But what truly impressed us was the level of customer support. I had a few unique scenarios I wanted to clarify, and after reaching out, I received prompt, detailed, and supportive responses. It is unusual to find a blend of well-designed software and exceptional support. I confidently recommend this app to anyone in need of managing their travel and residency details. It's an excellent tool, supported by a dedicated, thoughtful, and caring team. | I got this app to track my location for tax purposes. We have homes in both Florida and Minnesota. We just became FL residents. I wanted to be able to easily prove I was out of MN 183 days. I just checked the app and after only 33 days it is totally wrong. I was in FL 29 days and in MN for 4. It says I was 7 nights in and 26 nights out of my state of residency. I’m so disappointed as I trusted this app would do what it’s supposed to do. Now I don’t have the easy, accurate records to prove my residency for 2024. It’s too late to start another residency tracking app for this year. What a waste of money. So glad I only paid for a month and not a whole year. | Finally what I was looking for! Due to my work, I go from state to state throughout the year and come tax season it’s hard for me to figure out in what state I should file my taxes. With this app, the headache is gone as it counts my days automatically. I can also easily put in my previous trips to count the times I traveled before I installed the app. I also like the design and how intuitive it is.",4.67568,74,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2b/13/df/2b13df17-4004-d526-45ae-ef0abb330753/1d469fef-4019-402a-81f3-94eb0663f7d8_w_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ba/f1/f9/baf1f9e6-a03c-30ad-0253-43dea720aa3c/e447ab5d-85f6-461a-b93b-249e9699b8e3_w_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6f/87/4a/6f874aba-0edf-3598-95d8-8369f9c4c181/787418a7-c67e-4a02-86ff-bba0d28cc987_w_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/72/48/2e/72482e51-2dc1-3c5a-e686-f4a0079e3094/8d66813e-a216-49b4-b197-3e1b847e7866_w_4jpg.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f0/e6/44/f0e6444f-7816-261c-6f76-2e0d77a2caac/678a3389-e43d-4d70-a9b3-69c5c6406927_w_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a8/58/e4/a858e4d8-d590-7bbc-536a-1404492e8e49/43949152-4ac9-4c0d-9b5b-f919420063f7_w_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/af/2a/5faf2ade-fdab-bd39-30cc-37a64c34f328/f00ad6bf-f850-4d7a-8a36-ad743ce24d41_w_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3c/20/9e/3c209ec6-bc6e-85f9-9761-c93d4650f42e/1f4e344f-4ffe-448a-a1ac-6d4089d5b1ff_w_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5a/01/6a/5a016a6f-1c92-637b-b18a-9b6475d7af16/25b8fba8-9e4e-4e9e-b140-9c76bff55235_w_10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I even typed “store” into the search bar, but it just said “no results”.  Went with another app called TripIt.  Much better. | This app seems abandoned. Last update was a year ago. Most contents in the app just wouldn’t load. Nearly unusable. | Planning a trip to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown Ky and the Creation Museum in Petersburg Ky.  Neither available. 

So not very helpful for us trying to plan a vacation. Will try again someday. | I used this app in Paris, great. However, when I tried to use it in Portland ME, I could not find Portland Head Light, one of the oldest lighthouses in America, commissioned in 1791 by George Washington. There is no way to add manually. We can only add what’s already there. Need to update please. | Very short overview.   Limited content. | If you’re into 70%+ of their posts being TikTok videos that they share, along with nondescript titles or descriptions, cool I guess. But that’s literally all it is, along with the thumbnails/ previews all being broken. 
Trash. | It won’t let me change “searching in xx” if I try to switch the card pulls up from bottom of screen then immediately goes back down. Unable to swap and use a big portion of the app’s functionality. | It has a really nice interface, easy information at a glance! It’s really helpful and I can see myself using it in the future. It doesn’t have Istanbul, which is my upcoming trip, though. Would be nice! Thanks, lots of potential! | It seemed easy at first. I want to have hotels, museums and restaurants in my itinerary. The app couldn’t locate one restaurant. Also, I set up an itinerary and the app lost all the information so I would have to start over. | Like the idea. Unfortunately it is Very buggy. I can’t search what I want. And the design is not very intuitive | Don’t bother, this app is designed to serve ads and collect personal info in exchange for doing basic google searches. | Great idea and app, has great potential if the searches were more up to date | Literally just an app for bookmarking travel spots.  Obvious features that would make it far more useful such as notes, personal ratings, and being able to jointly share itineraries are missing. | I cannot recommend this app. The last update wiped my itinerary! Now I’m hoping support fixes it before I need to rebuild it all. 

I feel dumb for not taking screenshots of each day. But I liked the flexibility of changing my plans in here. | No se cómo manejar bien el app, para mi falta información de su manejo. | This app has no original content.   It just refers you to other articles and links filled with advertisements.   Stick with apple guides if you’re looking for crisp, well curated guides | Nothing original about this and they post terrible content all on Instagram. They just use other people’s work! | This app has a lot of good content, but the amount of notifications this app spams you with is absolutely insane. I heard a lot of good things about this app, so I just downloaded it the other day and I’ve been immediately bombarded with 30+ notifications per day. I just looked to see if there was a way to personalize what kind/how many notifications you get and there doesn’t appear to be any options for it. It’s either you get spammed with notifications all day, or you don’t get any at all. Or you just deselect a bunch of things that you’re interested in, but that totally defeats the purpose of the app. I don’t think I’ve ever left a negative review on here before, but I expected much better from such a highly regarded app. | best travel Apps EVER!!! | I couldn’t find anything, and it was much easier to just google locations. The app was much too complicated for my liking. | All this App does is refer you to TicToc or Instagram which I have no interest in adding to my phone. Very little original content. | Almost no useful info for places | Gracias | Kind of pointless. Miss Google Trips. | Too many error messages. Can’t even make a profile to start. App is updated. Just a lousy app | we can for our next one in Fall? | I love love love this app. I even use it when not traveling just to daydream and plan for the future. Love it! | Love it. Best place to get travel inspiration ideas. | Easy to use for travel plans and has lots of good information! | The perfect pocket guidebook for all of my travel needs! Helps feed my wanderlust, plan my upcoming trips and guides me while I’m in my destinations traveling! The content seems to be endless and always updating with the most recent things I should know about where I’m going! ♥️♥️♥️ | Planning a trip to Iceland and it was so helpful.  All the great places to stay and so informative to plan just about everything.    Such a genius idea creating this app.     Thanks Trip Scout | Very helpful | Literally opened the app to use it for the first time and nearly panicked thinking I got my own dates wrong. Calendar isn’t synced, sept is really October’s calendar for example. Event locations not updated to show new location addresses… not really impressed. 

I’ll stick with my old school way of planning. | These are tons of experienced travelers. They don’t take you to the top rated five star restaurant everyone is talking about... they take you to the hole in the wall, home cooked meal that seats a total of 7 people. And the meal is better than you’ve ever tasted. I have used this app from Cairo to Croatia to Iceland and it has saved me so much time on trying to find the interesting, desolate places! | Although Covid has put a damper on our travel this past year, we are ready to get back on the horse and continue seeing the wonders of the world.  We used TripScout exclusively to plan our last trip to Europe and it made our planning and executing seamless and informative.  Their network of travel experts, and travelers input makes it an extremely useful tool both for the novice traveler and nomads like my wife and I….on the road again yada,yada,yada | Amazing app. Need an android version for my friends. | I love how tailored everything on Trip Scout is for my travel plans! I have all the best recommendations and tips for a great vacation right in this app! | By far the most diverse yet organized platform out there for anyone planning to travel, or who travels frequently!! A must have app! | Love this app. Easy to use. Great for trip planning and inspiration. | Huge fan of this app and loving the upgrades!  I recommend this app to all of my traveler friends - backpackers, luxury vacation, solo travelers, family travel, etc - because it is so easy to navigate and sort through based on your own specific travel profile and what fits you as you plan your trip.  When I’m not able to get away, I love reading articles on TripScout’s app and dreaming about future travel! | Incredibly easy to use and packed full of worthy trip planning information. Tripscout offers multiple perspectives on travel and helps plan my dining, lodging and short term excursions given the content is so up to date. It’s also an enjoyable escape where I can take a few minutes and feel inspired about my next trip. | It’s amazing so helpful and perfect ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ | Absolutely love using this app. Travel is much easier and far more interesting when using Tripscout to plan and execute trips.

I can view all my travel photos pinned on a world map. I just got new photos from Thailand, and it can sync immediately. The new update truly change how I look back my trips! | I really like Nowy and can't plan a trip without it now! Not only it give me great ideas and itineraries using the planning features, but also the way it organizes all the guides and trips together. I've tried the new features of auto-journaling and well done - so much time saved! I absolutely love it. I do hope the journal part can be more flexible so that I can correct some of the AI-identified places | The function to automatically generate an itinerary starting from the days of duration of the trip is quite nice | I have used more than dozens of travel apps, but this one hands down the best I’ve ever used. It does not only gives you a detailed plan for attractions in cities - which is just a start, you can find the closest hotels, add your flight; customize your routes and find any activities as well. You can switch it to Google map as well. I’m so impressed with this app and really is “The” travel cọmpanion. | Nowy has many useful features, including AI-powered travel itinerary generation, hotel booking, and flight booking. Although I don’t have any travel plan at the moment, I can create and share future plans with my family and friends. Additionally, it’s easy to edit! | OMG this is such a game changer! They used AI to help me journal my past trips too and never thought it can be such an easy and fun way to journal my trips. I have been using Nowy to plan my trips and now I can journal past trips as well. It makes me wanna travel more! | Finally found a travel app that I can search any cities and even small destinations in Brazil and Mexico. It’s amazing, easy to use, great idea and cute pages. The best thing I like is the AI can keep recọmmending different hidden gems besides what you already had in the existing itinerary. Simply amazing! | It is really great and does everything I need. It’s perfect for organizing trip details and plan everything together.  I personally love it and worths 5 stars | I loves traveling and exploring new places but always struggles with planning. I can’t believe how this app is so easy to get a planning for you. Definitely recọmmend this app to anyone who wants to simply your travel. | I am so happy to have found Nowy! I used to spend so much time with vacation planning, but Nowy does it all for me in just a few minutes. Plus, I can book flights, hotels, and activities all in this app! No need for 10 different apps or websites anymore. Highly recommend Nowy!!! | I was booking a last minute trip to Amsterdam and decided to try Nowy to help me plan. Let’s just say, I am so impressed! It helped us find a last minute hotel one stop from the main station for a really good price. It also gave us suggestions of where to eat, what museums to attend and planned out the days with efficient travel routes. Some of the highlights of my trip that Nowy’s AI assistant suggested were: the Heineken Experience, the body museum, and a nighttime canal cruise to Amsterdam during the winter light festival (which was our favorite). It also gave us some great suggestions of local places where the locals eat. I can’t wait for my next trip! | I used to use Google Drive and sheet to plan out my trips. I NO longer need to do so.
This is app has made our trip planning so easy especially while planning a 10 day road trip from Las Vegas to Arizona and Utah! The itinerary has all the website, photos and addresses everything. Surprisingly we can see our live location inside the our trip and know the distance to the next stop!

After we finished the trip and organized the final itinerary, I found the itinerary can be shared completely to our friends and see the full itinerary by the share link! This is amazing and I don’t need to send Doc any more. What a life saver!

So good and helpful! | I was trying to plan a 3-day trip to Tokyo, and the AI generated a decent itinerary based on my preference. I shared the itinerary with my friend, and it got us started on planning out the Tokyo trip!! Highly recommend it to anyone looking to save time when planning trips. I hope the app will automatically find me the best deals based on my finalized itinerary. | I’ve been searching for an app that’s user friendly and aesthetic to journal my trips and after using Nowy for a while I know this is it! The app is easy to navigate through and has many great options to customize your trips the way you want. On top of that, I can search what fun locations are near me to explore. As a lazy but eager traveler, this feature has pushed me to go outside more. There’re new features coming out continuously to create better user interfaces. I absolutely love it! | This is an awesome app, great idea, very useful for travel and provide a lots of information.

Problems occurred with syncing between devices and Rob quickly replied with suggestions on how to fix. Rare that tech folks can respond quickly and effectively. Kudos to all. | Inroute is the easiest to use and best navigation app that I have tried . | The only problem I have with this app is when I’m looking for smaller roads to make a waypoint, I enlarge them to try to see what number of road it is and there is no label on the road. I’m doing this on a iPhone. | I love this app! I only discovered it recently because it was rated as great for car play, but it has quickly become essential for me to plan my routes based on the elevation chart. Living near the Rocky Mountains, elevation is often a key factor in route planning. | All works well just wish the map didn’t lag when searching and creating waypoints | There needs to be a way to change the numbers of points entered so that you can put them in order or can add a point that you see is needed later into the middle of the line somewhere and get it in the right order. Also when you are using, the route developed, it would be more desirable if the turns were referenced by road numbers rather than by street names because most of these people using inRoute are using it for commercial purposes and we use road numbers rather than street names. Desperately need the road number as the points description. The local street name does not help a person who is not from that area. The road number is the descriptor that we need. When the points have been positioned where they need to be, I do wish that the line and route would follow the pointsexactly by their number order and not try to route along the shortest route as the crow flies. We put in a specific order for a reason. Permits require exact, turning points and roots of travel. | I have multiple businesses and I use this routing app for multiple purposes I use it for routing out routes for showings, routing out routes to drive on trips. It just really comes in handy it’s worth every penny and it’s very very user-friendly. | I’ve tried at least half a dozen apps and this is the best for our travel. I can adjust the way points according to my mileage and easily find the best route. It’s not the most user friendly app but they are constantly improving | I’ve tried most of them and this is the best gps for me. I make multiple stops a day at regular addresses. This platform provides an excellent solution to gps guidance. It Integrates, imports , and optimizes routes in a not too complex way. I am very thankful for this app. | Can’t see all the road numbers. Tried everything and still nothing. Not very impressed with the app. | The app has the most flexibility in finding stuff every x miles. It is worth reading the tutorial to get the most out of it. | I find some of the user flow confusing in this app. I’m planning an 18 day trip. Its helped order my way points. It’s confusing why every way point can be a start or end stop as well. That’s un-necessarily complex UX. The segments don’t display time. 

In the list view (which is nice) it shows distance and time since origin - I see no immediate value in this. 

What I want is how long is the drive. While it alternates from stops to layovers, there does seem to be a fair amount of confusing / unnecessary text. For example “next step”
Is redundant as the next line has the step name. This makes the readability easier rather than burying these details. Would love for stops to include URLs to camp sites (I can add them). 

Happy to chat more if the devs are around. | Usability must be improved. There is no posted speed limit displayed, it does not seem to understand traffic problems ahead, you start on your smartphone and then on your RV display it says you have to end navigation and start again, and if you start any other app you have to start from scratch. Not what you’d expect for what you pay. | Not sure if I was maybe looking to have the ap do more than it is set up for, but I found this ap to not be very user friendly. It does not seem to give many options past just the mapped route. I couldn’t figure out how to even get roadside information like RV Parks, rest stops, fuel stations, etc. | Wished it had exit numbers | I can’t figure out how to turn toll roads off. | Purchased pro version of app for RV. I could not enter any specifications. App continues to ask to upgrade to pro version. Paid the monthly and cancelled.
Update:  went through the app restore process previous purchase and upgrade to no avail several times. | I work in the oversize, super load industry. Pretty much everybody I know uses this app because it is the best one for what we do. I have had many conversations with the people at inRoute, and they have made many, if not all of the changes I recommended to improve it. They listen. The one thing that still stands out as an annoyance is when you create a route, and then close the app. When you reopen the app and the route you created, it often tries to reroute you a different way than what you had chosen, or tries to get you to loop around or make u-turns. On some roads you have to figure out how to force the app to go the route that you want. 
Now, inRoute will tell you that you have to change your settings when you create the route because it will use current Apple Maps information and reroute you if it thinks it needs to or if you chose the wrong transportation method. This should not happen, but it does quite frequently. When a route is created, it needs to stay that way, under all circumstances. If there is a new road closure or detour along the route you created then they should simply have a pop-up window that tells you what the issue is instead of rerouting you automatically. The user should have the option to reroute, not Apple Maps or the inRoute app by default. Specifically, in my industry, we follow permitted routes. These routes are already determined by DOT to be safe, open, and available to us. And when I share this route with other users in my industry and they open up the app even when they select the “adjust” setting when trying to open it, the route still changes the route on us. This is a big glitch because I have had coworkers running with other oversize crews get on the wrong road because of the app making changes by itself. Yes, they should know the route or be able to read a permit, but the app should not change the route - no matter what! This is a big issue in the oversize industry. 
So, lastly, let me just say inRoute needs to stop this from happening and allow the user to make the changes if necessary, based on what I suggested above, that perhaps a pop-up window would come up and give the app user the opportunity to change the route, if necessary. The app should not do this automatically. It happens more often than you know. I’ve tried to get inRoute to change this before and they always tell me that when you’re sharing it, the other person needs to have the same settings. Well, my answer to that is when they download the map after I’ve shared it there is a selection that they can say “adjust”, and it will adjust the settings on their app to match the settings that the route was created with. And they still have issues. Other than this, I think it’s a great app. I’ve used it for nearly 3 years and they have made many improvements several of which I have suggested because of the industry I’m in.
It’s still the best app out there for planning a route, especially multi-state routes. | Needs to speed the directions while on a phone call instead of just beep. | The GPS map doesn’t spin around and stays North to South no matter what direction you’re driving and makes directions very difficult. | Rated four star because gps or maps need to be updated and the buttons could be a more user friendly. | Only 4 because of Apple Maps. Would be great if I could highlight railroad tracks and crossings when I ask for them. This app is used by a lot of truck drivers who move oversized loads. More information is better. Thank you. | This is my first time writing a review for an app. I enjoy using it as it helps me plan my trip before I leave. I gave it four stars simply because I couldn't find good sound quality, and the road highlights on the map are quite thick when zoomed out. | Worked great until the update. Now it won’t even open. Have uninstalled, reinstalled, restated phone, and everything else I can think of. Emailed company and no response. Would like to receive the service I pay for. | Need to include exit numbers. Also, a possible way to check bridge height while in hybrid mode. Other than that love using the app. Thank You. | I am a Road Captain for our local chapter here in Central Texas. I use this app all the time creating routes. 
My problem is that I can only use this app on my work phone, which is an iPhone. My personal phone is not. I would love to use this on another platform, and so would so many other users. 
Is there a plan to provide this free or paid service to Android users? | This app helps me see exactly how far I have between stops.. | This app is great for drivers like myself that haul tall wide heavy and long 
Very handy , worth every penny | Necesito que sea como antes que la aplicación me deba la oportunidad de enviar las confirmaciones | This could be the perfect app.  
I use this more then Apple map, Google map and Waze.   

InRoute is still much better then the others mentioned here for a family trip or simple deliveries. I love the weather updates and road closure updates as well as toll information, for all this,  I give 5 stars. 

Features I’d like to see added are speed limit notifications while using the app, satellite street view with split screen for over all route view while entering the desired route, these additions would increase the value of InRoute and the need for other apps to create a route in InRoute wouldn’t be needed.  

4 star for my type of work due to other apps needed to run at the same time for all information mentioned above. | Great does everything I need it to thanks for making it | I’ve tried the application for 2 days and found it is useless app. 
I removed my trail subscription , deactivated the service and uninstalled the app. 
Today I noticed that they charged my account for $4.31 while I’m not using your service at all. 
Be careful, don’t try the app until further update in this review.

Update:
The customer service didn't reply.
I was not able to get my money back.
Stay away and don't be fooled by the reviews that seems NOT to be true. | If you like driving past way points multiple times, flipping countless u turns, and backtracking half the time then this is the app for you. If you’re trying to be efficient in your route pass up on this app. But if you like driving around just to waste time then maybe give it a try. | I use this app everyday creating my daily lawn routes. Has saved me a lot of money and most importantly time. | I love the app but I’d like to see exit numbers and highway numbers when I zoom in on an exit to drop a pin. Zooming in reviews the local names of the roads but not the road number. If you could add these it would be closer to perfect. WE NEED EXIT NUMBERS!!! | Dependable - Accurate - User Friendly - Great planning tool | Trying this on my latest RV trip. Overall it’s OK. Could be a lot easier to customize routes but offset by the ability to save specific routes once customized. 

Major issues: 
1. No speed limit information - which is a major flaw
2. No off line maps.

Minor issues
1. User interface is one of the worst. Hard to find specific actions you want - including just saving routes.
2. Really not good for simply monitoring your driving. Really requires a destination to be useful. | Won’t plan route not good for delivery driver if you need to prioritize deliveries | Great app | The app keeps reversing the order of my stops on my route, no matter how many times I change it and/or save it. I’m planning a roughly circular route going south to west to north to east, the app keeps changing it to WSEN. Also, when I try to zoom in to see the number of a highway, the number stays small even though the highway itself enlarges.

I will not be renewing my subscription for the next month. | Motorcyclist and iphone users dream app. The best of the best. migrated from a dedicated Garmin device to this and brought all my routes over no problem. | This app is well thought out and purposefully built for the traveler. I had searched long and hard for an app that would serve me well on my cross country motorcycle treks …. Recommended it to all my friends. Sponsorship ??? | It is a good well thought out system, but if it were going to get better, it would have the exit number on the interstate highways. | Every update keeps this app getting better and better. It’s my go-to route creation tool for all my motorcycle trips. Highly recommended! | Love the app I am an oversize load escort. Even when raining when other apps stopped working enroute kept working. The only complaint I have is it would be great if you added exit numbers. Because sometimes I have to go to google to find exit numbers to stay on routes that we are permitted to go on by the states.it is the best tool that an escort can have in this business because we are not permitted to leave the route the states have given for any reason. | Great product. Needs mile post on the ramps | I really can’t say enough good things about this app. Sure, there are plenty of apps out there that will route you among multiple waypoints, but this one is different. To say it is designed intentionally is an understatement. The app automatically routes you to the next waypoint after reaching the previous one. The best part is little to know interface is required to keep the app running, which cuts down under distractions and ultimately increases productivity. I have found the app works best on an iPad but it’s great on iPhone as well. For five bucks, I think it’s the best money you can spend if you are in the delivery business or just want to efficiently route multiple steps into your day. What a steal- five stars all day. | I wish it would tell me of a turn while I’m on the phone | Be careful- not all routes are public roads. Pulling a fifth wheel is not easy. | Great app but needs a pause route button for when we stop at a waypoint but don’t want to end the route so it will quite giving verbal directions or tell you to return to route while walking around with my phone in my pocket. Otherwise love it!!! Also it would be nice if it also showed the speed limit for the road you are traveling on like the other navigation apps do.",4.61099,7843,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/14/9b/5f149b4b-d45f-07d0-33d9-9b8bdfd8bfe8/bb5ec3d5-851a-44cd-9e3c-ed233ba804af_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/06/d9/ec/06d9ecb3-a63b-28f0-f96e-fa0cc5dc76f3/c47fd096-aca3-476c-833f-6ff9acd63d84_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d6/d2/94/d6d294c4-bb44-d9a7-e606-754a94a8e4a8/30d3b8e8-7d57-4d36-8f22-be4f8b0f58a8_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a2/3e/7d/a23e7d2a-23da-bdca-41a1-055c69a60973/a6b2cf54-ec0c-44a4-b0f6-62fd4ae55a4f_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/c6/c2/1e/c6c21e4d-9261-f9f5-f8c7-53bf87bfc75d/3f2cfd8a-52f4-4b20-a9ea-1f64eb7aceef_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5d/c1/f3/5dc1f3f6-bda9-9472-54fd-7bbbaea867e8/1e33be3c-9adb-4ae6-8482-dc923a0a89a6_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5d/15/6c/5d156ce2-1158-6cd6-f445-8af6c5541bb7/1bdbbcfb-9e7d-4d2b-8482-c66b96c51a24_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot7.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b5/7e/82/b57e8290-38f8-bbd7-ecc5-d983a7b8ef59/d05ff24b-73f3-46be-8749-4213826e39be_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d7/71/14/d771148c-51b6-7fcb-200c-3edc80edf146/f329383d-12ba-4eac-b235-606360e613bd_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/55/f8/ba/55f8ba1f-2c95-86c1-c104-e9f0aad46bac/bbaf4e89-a99c-4e6b-b75f-fadd1e40d299_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/75/a7/ea/75a7ea9c-679c-3ed6-c69d-3b61e11563bf/0f15a272-ef5f-47d2-9490-1f628e703f02_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4f/cb/57/4fcb5750-3f68-b803-43a6-ebcbdb979494/45901626-6262-4f73-ac4e-387ce95e9df5_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot5.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a5/08/e4/a508e44c-9616-c411-ba06-010131ebf8d6/4d2f483d-3c17-4543-93c9-7f908e7c9bfe_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3b/13/8b/3b138b19-d1c0-783d-61e7-e6fe9a119bba/6fcc4c93-5a74-4feb-91fc-986c4d33330a_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot7.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mi

Has a lot of potential, but definitely needs work! Hope it improves quickly! | I love and miss the layout and design of pluto i was obsessed! But pogo is good as well! I love the detail and i love planning trips with this app! | The idea is there and I love the search and find option but the app is slow and anytime I click to view a category the app freezes or restarts. You’d think that exiting the app would fix that problem, but it’s just rinse and repeat and still freezes when trying to view the categories. Which really makes it more hassle than what it’s worth. | THE REBRAND IS SO BAD, I’m devastated. Pluto was one of my favorite apps and I can’t stand using the new version. The old branding was unique, beautiful and had character, not to mention the usability and functionality was also amazing. Was this rebrand tested with literally any users?? It could not have gotten positive responses. | Sorry, but the new branding is horrendous. I LOVED the old Pluto, and had it proudly on my home screen. The new logo, name, everything is so awful I’m tempted to delete the app altogether. I know rebranding takes time, effort, and money, but this was not the way to go, in my honest opinion. It feels like a cheap imitation of a popular social app, instead of embracing the unique beauty that was the old app. | I am not sure how this app received so many great reviews. It was very difficult to navigate. the flow didn’t make sense. I just was not impressed overall. | Tbh I never write reviews especially for an APP 💀BUT I’m planning a road trip soon and super exited so I wanted something to help keep me organized ✨it’s actually pretty good and cute and neat it’s like Pinterest in a way . I’m not a bot either :) thanks Pluto ! | The aesthetic of this app is incredible. 

One HUGE thing I wish it had is an actual
itinerary in date/time order. You can save everything in this app but it won’t show you a timeline like other travel apps do. 
Add that and a widget for your home screen, and I wouldn’t need any other app for travel. 

Unfortunately right now it doesn’t work 100% alone for me, I still use TripIt for the itinerary timeline feature. | I was looking for an app that would allow me to collaborate trip ideas with my friends. With very few reviews, I was uncertain, but decided to give Pluto a try and I’m so glad I did! 
So far the user experience is top notch. The app is running very smoothly, no lags or glitches. It’s very intuitive and user-friendly, and in minutes I was easily able to navigate myself around, start a trip and invite my friend to collaborate. 
A few suggestions:
When initially walking through the first steps, I would like to be able to pick a region to travel, not just a specific state or city. For instance, I wanted to be able to say Pacific Northwest, but that wasn’t an option. Also, I would like to be able to create my own categories within the trip. 

Solid five stars for usability and of course that it’s free. | i’ve been on the hunt for a travel/itinerary app that was easy on the eyes and incredibly user friendly! | I normally look at Pinterest or YouTube to look up things to do. I love that they already have popular things to try. | Awesome app for planning our holiday! there were lots of things I look for - but until now, I haven’t seen them all in one place. 
The app is very easy to use. You can also save ideas and places to eat. 
And also it served you up inspiration from the app’s recommendations.

Need to make a change with no option for it. | Why dont i have options to add a car rental anad or stay on the app when booking a flight? | They are horrible. No matter how hard  you try you will never be able to speak with a representative. They say you can cancel on line. Good luck with that. | Descargue la app pero cuando la abro se cierra automáticamente | The web site seems full of ads and rabbit holes. I found it difficult to get to where I wanted to go. | I loved the room just enough for one person and yes l would return that hotel the Atmosphere was nice. And most importantly the  staff was
Wonderful everyone was so very nice. | This compay provide its services inside the settlements which are built of stolen Palestinian land ! Boycott Expedia | There is no help. I am trying to get two online Expedia accounts merged together as 1. I have an old email and new email but I only need 1 Expedia account. All they want to talk about is my reservation | Delta is horrible   Bought tickets to Rome for my  83 year old and me for June 17 round trip. She has heart failure and had been hospitalized twice we submitted proof and delta would not let me su substitute someone else or refund our money. Told me I could  bring a corpse. Would not give Expedia one star. Expedia would not help at all No credit or 
Money | I love the app and a lot of the amenities but when you have an issue, it is a nightmare, trying to get support that you can actually talk to. | I recently booked a hotel through Expedia. My mistake not checking the reviews first only went by their nice photos.  I purchased the insurance and tried to cancel the reservation but they would not. The hotel was Oyó in Monroe La. Book at your own risk.  

If I could give them some negative stars I would. The guy from the Expedia team gave me a wrong number to some sex line. They were RUDE & VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. DO NOT BOOK | If you miss a lower rate the best Expedia can do is say Sorry | How am I supposed to use the app when it won’t let me sign into it. | They were very accommodating at checking me in early and out late - I’ll have to say even during breakfast a nice man helped me with my tray- very nice and accommodating during my stay. Would definitely stay again. | i was trying to do something but got this pop up 

stop CTA spam | Beautiful hotel and location. great restaurant delicious food and great staff. | I use iphone13 mini.
I could install the app, but it won't open. Keep crashing. | Elle and Gilly went above and beyond while checking in. | Hertz did not have my rental even with rsvp. Other vehicles available but wanted to charge more instead of honor their rsvp and price. Hertz never again!!!! Went to enterprise more professional and better customer service.  

You might want to check your vendor hertz in castleton Indiana. They are scandalous | I booked a flight and I’m trying to check the flight times. The app crashes and now it is saying that my flight is confirmed but it won’t open for me to see the times. | Hotel had no staff after hours and in process of getting refund kept kicking me out of app when switching to get ridiculously long itinerary number and chat is run by people who speak little to no English and inept. First and last time using Expedia app. Before apps they were excellent | This place is great! Very inviting. Smells good. Comfy beds. | Expedia? Or One Key? Or what?
Signed in, but need to sign in again?
Horrible experience | When buying a ticket late. It’s all good. | If you are looking for peace of mind , don't ever book through Expedia..
They as overall perspective is not responsive..i was surprised to see that they don't have flights on their app for certain destinations..😏😏😏😏i Booked few trips but I understood now they are overall poor and don’t want to improve or take feedback , they ll just revert through automated emails or standard formats.. | Unable to sign up and unable to get to my booking.
I would give you a negative star! | Very nice, clean hotel with comfortable beds/pillows. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Plus the location was perfect! Downtown without being right on Broadway, which helps for noise since it is rockin all night. Highly recommend! | Excelente | This app does very little to help with canceled flights or complications while traveling. Generally speaking, it’s very difficult to get help from Expedia. It’s easy to book (give Expedia your money) but anything else besides that is painstakingly horrible. If an airline cancels your flight, Expedia simply gives up and says call the airline. | When and where I love this app | The new rewards system is garbage. Between here and hotels.com I’ve spent tons of money and only got 44$ in rewards. I book all my hotels through here or hotels.com and I can assure you that once I burn through the rewards i have left till be using another travel booking system. | I booked three rooms. I received confirmation for 2 but not the third. I sought help. I received an inadequate response and then the typing in the chat was disabled. Now I have no way to resolve this issue. I just spent over 6k and I cannot get any help. | Did not help. did not give me what I requested. something as simple as the customer service phone number. why is that so difficult, I shouldn’t have to explain to a virtual agent what I wanna talk to real person about. | way to many glitches, i can barely use the app | Five Stars ⭐️ | I had a piece of metal in my meal onboard Korean Airline flight 36 on April 10 2024. I was taking a holiday to celebrate my birthday and the airline failed. They served me metal in my food that broken several crowns and I ended up swallow it. I had to run into the bathroom to go it up the metal so it didn’t cause a blockage or perforation in my intestines or bowel. Which could have been fatal. The airlines nonchalant attitude could have killed me. The airline sent me an email stating they MAY or may NOT pay for the damages. I wasn’t even offered a complimentary upgrade or anything. NEVER FLY KOREAN AIRLINE, or do so at your own risk. I will be speaking with an attorney when I get back to the states. This just isn’t right! | My Expedia hotel reservation was not found while checking in by front desk which made my experience very frustrating. Front desk was able to locate a room at an affiliated hotel for us. I will think twice before going through Expedia again. | Expedia use to have great customer service….not so much anymore! | We really enjoyed our chalet, it was immaculate, comfortable, with beautiful view.  Jane was nice and gave us a warm welcome.  Highly recommended stay. | Not working | This App has given me so much trouble tried to book a trip and it kept telling me no matter how many times I changed the flight the fare wasn’t available to change it. Finally I changed the whole destination and American Airlines triple charged me keeping me from booking my hotel and flight home. COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT | The place was amazing perfect for my stay.
It made the perfect intro to doing sound healing event’s in town near balboa park, the room was very spacious made the stay that more enjoyable, parking was good, that have a parking in garage option, coffee, tea etc.. I want to definitely keep this place on favorites.. | Very horrible customer service agents do not give calls when requested and basically are uneducated on refund policies . I was given 3 completely different answers on my refund by 3 different agents and one of them basically lied to me as they insisted and I have photos of our conversation of the Expedia agent telling me to call British airways that they have a credit for me under my name yet the two times I spoke with British airways they said they refunded Expedia and Expedia needs to refund me so on my 2,000 $ ticket I am left so far dry with no refund for my return leg which I could not take and  I am going nuts because  hate Expedia customer agents only chat and when I ask for a phone call I get nothing and they give me wrong answers as well . I need a lawyer | I booked a trip to NY because my daughter was giving birth on April 25 so I booked a flight on April 24 and return on April 28 My daughter had complications and they were delivering her a week earlier I called Expedia customer service which was horrible it took about an hour just to figure out how to talk to a human being I informed them that I went to airport and worked with delta and they did a credit and it cost an extra 100 to change no problem they got me on next flight out on Wednesday I called Expedia to change my return flight after I already called Frontier airlines and they said I had to talk with Expedia because i booked with them I called Expedia finally got a human and they did absolutely nothing I just wanted to thank you from bottom of my heart for being so heartless in a customer s time of need I hope u go out of business for your horrible customer service and for not even contacting a person at frontier and seeing how we could work something out I’m telling everyone I know friends family social media how u work thanks for making a crazy week of my life even worse | I love this app all my trips I always book through this app is the best I highly recommend. | The Expedia App does not work well. 
You can’t get anything done. You can’t even sign in. | I had to make a change to a car rental pickup & dropoff times for a pre paid rental. First, you can’t modify thru the app. Then I call the rental car company who tells me they can’t modify it cus it’s prepaid. Can’t cancel it either. Then I call Expedia “Customer Service”. I get some guy in India, & it takes over 30 minutes to get the 1st reservation cancelled, get a new reservation with the correct pickup & dropoff times. I get an email after getting off the phone confirming the new reservation only to find that the guy made the new reservation with a different company!! 
Unbelievable. This was the 1st & last time using Expedia. | Expedia doesn’t respond to you. We were charged for carry on. We had free checked bags. They told us at the check in they were fine. Then, they held us up and the departure checking our bags. Plus… they charged us $40 each for the carry on. This makes about as much sense as we dealt with boarding. United airline employees are definitely union workers. You can tell by their, “I don’t really care attitude”. | The first airplane was nice with tv the second one no tv no way to charge ur phone | First time ever visiting Kalamazoo Michigan. Great hotel. Great stay. However we were told if we needed water we could call to get more. Called for more water on day one. Didn’t get any. Called for water on day two and was told that they were busy cleaning rooms but would surely get water to the room. No show! I was disappointed.

Not everyone has Apple so it’s best to make your app cross compatible for all devices. | So far I am liking this app very much. I am using it to plan a trip to London and with the exception of o e bug I am finding it useful. 

When adding an activity to a daily itinerary the transportation menu only gives you walk,car,bike as options and excludes public transportation. Once you have added the activity you have to select the travel time in the itinerary and switch it to public transportation. 

It would be nice if the app tied into Google maps and calculated transportation time rather than relying on the person to figure it out. | Great for people who enjoy outstanding graphic visuals as opposed to bland black and white itineraries thrown together on Google docs. | I’ve used this for my last 5 trips. I’m never going back to TripIt! | I am absolutely blown away at how beautiful this app is. I am building apps with the same technology that the developers of this app uses, and I admire them for being able to pull this off so well. | I’ll start with what I love:
- Beautiful UI with nice details throughout
- Does a great job of using location photography and the UI to make the places your going exciting (compared to a lot of overly utilitarian apps out there like TripIt)
- The map with lines to where all you’re going and the sequence is awesome and something I’ve really wanted on past trips before finding this app
- Easy to discover places to go in the city you’re going

What still needs some work:
- When searching for places to add, the font size is too large and cuts off the right end of names so it can be hard to tell which is which (like with hotel names that can be different locations for the same chain)
- Before getting to exact times for each place you want to go there needs to be a staging step where you can add locations w/o time to decide on which you want to go to, then add a time or to the timeline after sharing or knowing for sure you want to go. 
- The drag and drop is frustrating currently because as you add more places to the timeline it ends up making existing ones shorter instead of pushing them to the next hour. Having to go back and make something that became 10-15 minutes (which very few events make sense to be that short) and resizing them doubles to triples the time it takes to add all the events.

What would make it a 6 star app:
- Having hotels in it is fantastic...but why not the flights? If you’re going to multiple destinations it leaves an odd whole in your timeline to not have the flights and be able to plan for how early you need to checkout of the hotel or how much time you have for other stuff.
- iPhone is great for while you’re traveling, but an iPad version would help a ton for planning the trip and seeing the details of locations and events with more room. | Tried this app during the beta and liked it, but I did not get to try it much. Now I can’t get it to work because all it does is crash.

Edit: Still crashes on startup. I did not say it crashes when opening old trips because I can’t even open the app.
Edit2: I don’t know if it’s a bot answering my reviews, but again: opening old trips is not the issue. The issue is that I can’t open the app because all it does is crash. I wish I could enjoy the potential of this app, but it is impossible when it won’t open.
Edit3: App is now working! | Looking forward to seeing this continue evolving. | Adding more than 2 cities to a trip didn’t work. Sometimes a third popped up, but when adding a fourth both the third and fourth just disappeared. | UI seems nice but functionally there are some issues as others have mentioned. Right now I can’t even remove a trip, it just freezes up during the loading state. Really want something like this to work but at the least, devs should have some sort of tests in place that catch these kinds of major bugs.

Edit: originally gave 3 stars but I literally can’t even open my trips now without an error. It’s not functional at all. | Tried to plan a bachelor party with this app but with out the ability to share with the boys defeats the point of creating an itinerary | I really wanted to love this app, but it isn’t very intuitive and is hard to use. I am trying to plan a trip to Japan with multiple destinations, and when I try to adjust the dates of one the rest of them get messed up! I also somehow got the destinations out of order and can’t figure out how to put them back. I also experienced loading screens that went on forever, it was the screen when I picked Japan as my destinations and it displayed an error message. I’m hoping these problems get fixed, because I really like the app otherwise. | This app is the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. It was incredibly glitchy, very inaccurate information, and in general just hard to use. 
I don’t know who the makers of this app are, but you need to go back to the drawing board. I’d honestly rather use Google Maps as a tourist planning app than this, and we all know how Google Maps is not even good. 
Also, the logo is a complete ripoff of the Tesla logo. Really shows lack of creativity. Just from seeing the logo I knew there wasn’t much hope. 
Have a nice day. | Well the developers are my friends + this app kind of blew my mind. So I'll give it a five star. Probably add an instruction video at the very beginning? Actually took me a while to find the drag feature.

It's a clean and simple route planner for roadtrippers and campers like you - no matter if you map out your annual cross-country road trip or you live the #vanlife dream and explore the world in your campervan. Nothing beats the freedom of the open road.

PLAN MULTI-STOP ROUTES

Plan your trip itinerary on an interactive map and pin as many locations on the map as you need. Search locations of attractions, trails, or national parks and save points of interest in a list. You can now add your personal notes to every stop.

SEE DISTANCES & DRIVING TIMES

See distances connecting the road trip waypoints and know the driving times between multiple stops. Easily plan your time on the road and your gas and fuel consumption.

SHARE YOUR TRIP (like Google My Maps)

Share your trip and collaborate with friends on finding the most interesting sights and the best places to stay the night.

FIND PLACES ALONG THE ROUTE (like Roadtrippers)

Use search shortcuts to quickly find good restaurants, interesting sights or good value campsites. Type ""pizza"" or ""burger"" in the search to display these places on the map. Or just click on any place or POI in the map and add it to your list of stops or starred places.

MARK FAVORITE PLACES

So pleased to have everything at our fingertips vs having to use 4 different apps for things like gas stations, rest stops and offbeat attractions.  

Well done | I’ve used Roadie twice to take a long road trip, and loved it both times. it’s extremely easy to use simply plug in your destinations and add them to your route. it offers a way to kind of schedule/rearrange your itinerary, which is extremely helpful. You can use the itinerary to plan out how long each day will be or what you plan on doing each day of your trip. I did what seem to be bugs in certain areas. For example I was planning a trip that was going on the “Going to The Sun” road and for some reason it kept calculating the route going around the whole park to the other side. | I can’t fully commit to paying for premium if I can’t see what I am paying for.  I need an app I can commit to for my trips. There’s not enough with the free version to make an informed decision.  So I will go with the competitor RoadTripper. With that I can see what I am paying for. Too bad. I was open to trying something different from the usual. 

Unfortunately they lost me as a customer from the beginning.  Maybe in the future they’ll change this and I can consider them for my next series of trips. 

Roadie if your reading this, please consider. | Free version is worthless. Maybe it’s better if you pay. | I would use this app over Google maps but they make you pay just to invite your friends to your map which is kinda stupid considering that majority of the times you are going to want to share with friends | Love the idea, but tons of little issues that make it super annoying to try and use. Definitely not subscribing for another month but I appreciate their efforts. Maybe in another few iterations it'll get to a product that feels pleasant to use. | What is the point of this app VS just going straight to Apple Maps?  This still just takes you to Apple Maps and in fact makes it a lot less seem-less. Bugged I wasted my money because I forgot to cancel before trail was up and was charged for a full year. Not sure where they got all their good reviews. | The app was everything I wanted while planning my road trip from Kentucky to Utah and California!  Super easy to use and works great, and I like that I was able to name stops and split it up into sections so it made it easy to keep track of what day I was planning each stop! | I’ve spent 15 minutes playing and find it way to lacking on everything. I cannot even find the way to read the step by step instructions for a route.

Very minimal web site also. Not discussion that I see about the Premium at all.

Not enough reviews to be rated after 3 years.

I feel they need a macOS app as I prefer using a real keyboard and a larger screen display to plan my trips. Yes, the iPad app will run on an M1 Mac albiet in a tiny screen window.

I'll stick with the great Road Trip Planner - far more features. | After easily installing, I had issues with the app. Mainly text and print not lining-up correctly. Deleted and will stick with Waze. | Used the app for road-tripping all over the West. Convenient and effective. The developers are accessible and ultra responsive. Totally worth the upgrade! | I thought I would be able to put in multiple stops and build a itinerary but, I don’t think it allows and the app is not user friendly. | ဆက်မသုံးတော့ဘူး | This is the app I would have made - super fast, clean, simple, but still has everything you need to plan a trip. Extremely well done, I bought the lifetime immediately (thank you for having that as an option and not forcing me into a subscription plan). | Just getting started. So far, simple & easy to read. | Not paying for an app that you can't try first. | I was hoping to import a trip into this app hoping to use some of its features, but all I get is an error. Tried several different trip files and restarting ect, but nothing has worked. Wish I could get the $30 bucks back. | Very disappointed the the paid version of this app. I was hoping to use the app to plan ahead and see stops to add along the way. We are going from texas to Florida, I mapped the route, clicked hotels and it showed a group of hotels in north Arkansas (a state we are not even entering). The companies soliton is too zoom in, piece by piece rather being able to conclusively plan the trip, we have too basically look 4-5 times but by bit. There is not way better than any free app such as Google Maps to plan a route. In fact google maps actually shows things “along the route”. | Easy to use and share plans.
Wish I could plan day of driving or have app auto plan days. Seeing upcoming weather and better ‘attractions’ highlights would make it a killer app. | Hard to navigate, adds stops out of order and you can’t change them. It’s impossible to sort out. Canceling | Can’t find and add stops, can’t get alternative routes for entire trip. | Love this app.. work better than road warriors | We downloaded the app to find scenic routes, and interesting things along the way. Attractions, Gas Stations, Campsites, Hotels, Parks, etc. are all behind the paywall. Without purchasing the premium subscription, it’s a less useful map app. | This app is paid app when most are free | I love the interface. Very easy to use and can search for just about anything I type into the map search. The smart insert feature is also great when adding a new point to your route in the middle. It gives you estimated miles and times between your points so you know how long/far you will be traveling any leg. Your can save trip routes for planning more than one trip at a time (2 in free version, infinite in purchased version). 
As I pull a travel trailer (RV) for my trips, there are a few things I would like to see added and be able to test in the free version before I purchase the upgrade.
1- allow specs of my travel trailer (length, height, weight, propane on board) to be entered so the app can map around any low clearance bridges, weight limited roads, propane limited tunnels, hairpin turns, etc. to be sure the road mapped is safe for travel with my RV.
2- ability to identify specified miles and/or time travel down a route so that a campground/stay search can be done in that area. Currently, I take a guess by sight, add a random stay point to the route and see how long/far it takes to get there. If wrong, remove point, guess further up or back and repeat until my miles/time is close to what I want to travel in a leg. It’s functional but could be made much easier if the app can just pin a point in the route at how far/long you want to travel as an option.

With these 2 functionality adds, this app would be worth purchasing for me. | I hate that so many apps these days say they’re free but once you start trying to maneuver around the app, you find out you can’t do much of anything without paying some monthly or annual fee. | After paying for the app, as the free version would not allow me to complete my trip, I found it kept rerouting me to roads I did not want to travel on. Would not allow me to select the road I wanted. It is like a section of the road did not exist even though it shows the road on the map. I attempted to use the Contact Us (send an email) and it does not work. Fortunately they only got one months worth of payment out of me. The trip I am planning is on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Once you purchase the app they provide a sample trip of the Blue Ridge Parkway and it is jacked up too.

Update:  after contacting the developer they did a great job of explaining the issue and provide a resolution. Response from developer was fast and professional. I will continue to use the app for my upcoming trips. | When I opened the app, it grabbed a location near me from GPS and made it my home location. When I attempted to change it to my actual address, I was prompted to upgrade to the full version to be able to do so. Really? How are you supposed to plan a trip without setting a starting point?

Failure to be able to change even the most basic information without paying for the full version renders the app unusable to me. I can understand that adding locations, or notes, would require an update to the full version, but preventing a user from setting up a basic profile is pretty unforgivable. Deleting this app immediately! | This is not a very good user friendly app and I wish I had never purchased it!!!! Sad :-( | So easy to use. Can’t wait to plan more trips | Was trying to plan a road trip from Illinois - Oregon - California - Oregon - Illinois and this app was just perfect for giving us the ability to plan out stops for fuel, find great rest stops along the way and even some crazy attractions.
I would recommend this app to anyone who is wanting to plan any kind of road trip. On my trip back to Illinois, I was able to follow Rte 66 and see all of the attractions that I have been wanting to go see. 
The only thing that I had to watch out for was when finding the next stop on my route was that the ‘Smart Add’ feature sometimes inserted the stop in the wrong place so it had me going backwards at a couple of points. But other than that, this is a great app. Thanks for making it happen. | Downloaded the free version, worthless, doesn’t make me want to pay for upgrade, put locations in bizarre order, making the trip twice as long as needed, says you can tap and drag to change order of places? How? Guess you have to pay?
Useless! | This app would be a 10/10 if it had landscape mode!!!

Update: landscape mode added! It’s awesome now. | Love the concept. It started basic but getting better and it appears the developers listened to feedback and have since updated the app to make it even better. | The app says it works on iPad and iPhone.  I downloaded it on my iPad.  It wouldn’t orient itself with the iPad.  It only works when the iPad is held vertically.  My case prevents that.  I then tried it on my iPhone X.  I was able to creat an account.with no trouble.  However, when I tried to actually use the app, it would send me to location services in settings.  This continued even after I enabled everything for the app.  I’ve defeated the app and will look for one that I can actually plan trips on. | Handles multiple stops very elegantly, love that collaboration is now possible. Overall very intuitive to use. Would love to see a smart order feature that orders all stops in a route and/or section, and would also be a nice to have to calculate the price of fuel for the trip. 

Once you’re on the road I could also see a good feature being what is easily accessible for the next 5 or so exits. Often we’re looking for a bathroom or something to eat and by the time we figure out whether it’s on our side of the freeway we’ve passed the exit 😂

Glad to have this app, and have had a lovely experience with any communication with the development team. | This is a great simple app for planning a road trip. Love the design and simplicity, and the developer is very responsive to feedback. | It’s an app that just draws a line from one place to another, and you can add stops along the way. Not much else. If it does any of the other things- I can’t find out how because there’s like 6 buttons and the ui is bad. | This is a great app. Would like just a couple more options but a really great app. Thank you!!",4.59389,1507,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/3f/d7/9b/3fd79ba6-8b2b-0a32-f0b7-214c40fbbc85/c33a3ebd-2e6c-4987-8753-974428cbe7c8_iOS_small_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/cb/00/85/cb0085c7-4d8f-f676-ac79-b927ab27db7b/4361969b-a1dc-4bf6-9e4c-ddf38ebbc9d4_iOS_small_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/24/1b/91/241b91dc-27ce-3a0c-b1ad-ef1dc130af9b/008ba569-449e-416f-b90f-c6e1004bf101_iOS_small_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/cb/a4/34/cba43489-b613-fed3-26ee-d6d7368cdc71/3ab099ef-a598-4e88-93e4-e47e02ba255f_iOS_small_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/7f/2b/d9/7f2bd98a-0bb2-aedc-826f-1b54129ebe50/9fbabe0f-890e-42c0-9838-0853c288d28e_iOS_small_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/63/5e/2f/635e2ff5-3fb6-0e28-97be-8eee37e1977e/cf1b6faf-0cb8-4401-9c59-841c92052dd3_iOS_small_6.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/6f/7b/44/6f7b44bd-512f-1ca3-c19b-3e174ee934dc/47bd4344-f431-4448-ac2b-76de7b7471f9_iPad_Pro_0.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/a8/6d/bb/a86dbbc9-b423-8a0e-8038-55d2019f7352/b6ba20ba-aff6-4339-b1b3-f031aac6d25f_iPad_Pro_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/8e/c5/f3/8ec5f350-bd5a-2686-8f94-c981b48446c9/e0b97803-78fe-4fa6-b16c-663b6918bd92_iPad_Pro_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/b1/a6/bf/b1a6bffc-3b5e-33a0-e64d-55ce0eb07950/2cfadebf-1236-4fc5-a9d1-76ff511d945a_iPad_Pro_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/82/c3/14/82c31463-99c6-1a3e-c398-f90f281a22db/af51ac90-d468-47ad-83fd-82888a854237_iPad_Pro_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/75/a7/da/75a7daf4-1b1e-19bc-1b91-d926f99141be/722d45e8-b912-41cd-9ed2-de78456f56f9_iPad_Pro_5.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Pl

Staying in this hotel was my favorite part of a three country trip. | Es bien amigable para utilizar, facilita el proceso de reserva | La aplicación es muy afable y siempre segura nunca he tenido ningún contratiempo reservando por esta app | It was very nice to stay here, they are polite hosts✨ the hotel has a very clean environment, the rooms are cleaned in the morning, they also constantly change towels, they have a kitchen both in the room and in the living room, they treated us with a delicious sandwich 🙊 they are very caring and warm, if we come again we will definitely come back here ✨10/10 | I really appreciate all of amazing , cleaning, kindly  staff this is my third time I booked on same hotel, nice and friendly costumer service and so so so clean I want to say thank you to all of management team, and thank you Sohal and Asraf they’re cleaning my room on perfect way and honest people. | Whoever was the chef in musada when i was there should be retained. He or she is so good! | Until it wasn’t anymore.  I found that most hotel stays are now “non-refundable” and I wasn’t offered the insurance option.  I think my booking.com days are coming to an end.  I also found my reservation was cheaper on another app after I had already booked the trip.  Some of my prior stays were terrible and the app doesn’t make up for any unpleasant stays.  A review is the best they can do to help which only helps the next person if at all. | The process was easy and did not take all that much time | App is very easy and simple to use. Very user friendly and all information for hotels very detailed and well organized. Hands down an awesome app a must to have on all smart phones and tablet devices. Booking.com rocks! No worries, free your mind... | Booking.com make it so easy and stress free booking a hotel room and offering all of the services in one place with great prices. I highly recommend Booking.com! Super excited for my upcoming trip to see myGrand babies! | Nikola was such a gem to deal with, in every way. He gave us clear directions, met us on the street when we arrived and even provided us with umbrellas. He was not only a friendly host, but also provided a beautiful property! The view is unmatched and the studio was large. The balcony had comfy furniture and the shower was large! This was by far the best experience I’ve had with a property from booking.com from my month long trip to Europe. Thank you again, Nikola! God bless to you and your family. | Excellent sea view and location, beach entrance just cross the street, staff is care and polite, the price is reasonable, will stay here next time visiting QUY NHƠN | If you’re looking to put your short-term rentals on Booking.com, please save yourself the headache and do not do it. Booking.com customer service is the worst I’ve ever dealt with. Had guests destroy my home and they did nothing to help after telling me for months the “finance department will reach out to me to resolve this issue” months later and countless calls/messages still have not heard a thing. | It was a wonderful, homey, comfy farmhouse. We enjoyed our experience. | Rien à dire sur votre application, on peut effectuer une réservation en toute sécurité sans moins de 2 minutes. | The app is very easy to book a hotel, highly recommended | Booking.com has never failed me! It always has the best prices and recommendations for all of my vacations! 😁 | Arrived at 4:00AM and was happy to make the 6 minute walk to the great apartment. Host provided video of every step for self check-in and we were delighted it all worked quickly. We were provided with a late checkout as requested, and we certainly needed it to get some extra sleep. The kitchen is amazingly well provisioned with everything you could need to prepare breakfast or even a dinner meal.
The entire place was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable.  We highly recommend that you stay in the cozy place. Great communication with the host. | It helps me find and book the best room or site.  I love the map that shows where all the rooms are located by price.  I also love that I can set in depth parameters for my search.  Last, love the additional discounts they provide, the more you use the AP!! | Hadjer was too kind to me, my suitcase broke and he helped me close it. I also loved the room, very clean and there is no noise! | Fast and easy, and always they have a great deal | read the subject line again. | We had a great time in the apartment.
Host was very helpful to us.
Great location | Quick & Easy!!! | If there was a 0 star rating BDC has rightfully earned it… actually, it would be a negative star rating… no question, & I’m not exaggerating, the worst customer service I’ve experienced on any level! It’s comical | About 18 months ago, I used the app almost daily for two months while traveling in Europe. I found it clean, responsive and very helpful.

Lately, I’ve been doing some traveling around the United States. I don’t know what Booking.com thinks they are doing, but I am seriously considering switching to, another service. I’ve had problems confirming with accommodations over the app. I received an email asking me to evaluate a hotel that I had not yet stayed at leading me to believe that I had booked the wrong night. In response I rebooked for the correct night and after I was finished booking the app informed me that, I had already booked for that night but since the booking was nonrefundable, I was stuck.

They are also not at all transparent about additional fees until you are just about to confirm the reservation. I don’t get it. They know what the fees are. Why can’t they just put them upfront so you can fully evaluate an accommodation?

All in all I am very disappointed in the direction Booking.com has taken over the last 18 months. | One of the easiest user friendly apps! Love it! | The app switch the dates I need and booked for the wrong day, once I realized what happened I canceled immediately. However I was still charged. The “ customer service for this app”  lied and said the tried to contact the property, I know because I contacted the property! They, booking.com charged my card and is trying to keep my money! I have reported them and will continue to as fraud. | Wonderful app and very responsive! | Booking.com is easy to use and has so far been great. | D ce nu pot Descarcă aplicația fără payment request??

Definitely a great service . | Great | They are good they help you with anything you may need and get you the best prices available. | It keeps sending me prices. I love it for dreaming and planning. | Great app. Great prices. ✨ | They reimbursed me my money when my hotel got canceled and got me into another room asap ,they got great flight options and if it all goes well I’ll be booking my flight from Ohio to Puerto Rico this July 👏🏽great app highly recommend | I always buy my tickets on this app I never have any trouble and I find the better prices here. 
This review is totally honest, I’m recommend hopper! | Always there when I need a quick flight ✈️✈️✈️ | To use | I have an account and cannot log into the website I have called numerous times to technical support. I am trying yo delete my account but cannot get into my account to do so. I have never written a review before but fed up going through the same process. | I had the worst experience and lost over $500. I cancelled my flight within 24 hours and they didn’t process it and suddenly it was not refundable because of the airline policy. The insurance that I also purchased through them surprise surprise doesn’t cover it either. 

They take zero responsibility and are extremely rude. I was on the phone for an hour trying to get help. Only for their supervisor to be twice as rude as Dev. 

Funnily enough I had about three trip that I was going to book through them later in the year, but now forget that. Save your money spend it with another company with better morals/customer service. | Never encountered a problem, very user friendly app and some great prices :)) | Great app for affordable prices | Have been booking my flights through Hopper since 2018. It’s now my “go to”, whenever I need to travel. I highly recommend it. | All on one page | Fantastic | So I turned on the alerts months ago to notify me of the best deals to book my flights to Mexico. Every time I checked in it would tell me to hold off and wait for a better deal. Now I’m a month out from booking my trip and flights are the most expensive they’ve been! Not once did it recommended I purchase my tickets (which by the way the best deal was a few months ago). 

The whole point of this app is to help save money on flights and travel. If you can’t even do that right you’re failing at the your whole purpose. I’m deleting this app after I post this.

Just stick to google flight. | 💪💪💪💪 | I am a new Hopper user. The app is easy to use and provides great insight into various date and flight options that are useful. | I find good prices for flights. | Doing great on this thing can always find what I’m looking for. | Convenient, quick flight check | I Love this app! | The app is so easy to use and they always find me the best deals! | Love the discounted prices! | I am not one to leave reviews but this app literally took my money ! I booked a 2 night motel at pismo for my birthday with hopper April 3rd They charged my debit card for $261 that day and the representative I spoke on the phone who was helping me book let me know I was good to go and I wouldn’t have to pay when I checked into my motel!! Well the day had come to check in at my motel April 19th and the guy working there told me my room was only reserved!! And not paid for!! So if my room was only reserved then what did I pay for hopper?? I was not going to sleep in my car so I had to pay another $192 for my 2 night stay at pismo I tried calling hopper support and told me they’d work on the issue and receive an email in 48 hrs confirming a refund and I still have not received anything. Why was I charged the $261 if my room was not booked ! Where did my money go too? It’s absurd that I had to pay again at check in. I really wanted to like this app but unless this issue isn’t resolved I will keep calling and warning everyone about this app until I get my money back. Confirmation number: 5MPXGV2B82B5 | Save tons of time and money | Easy to use and always has the best deals | I’m a hard worker who always pays attention to every penny, I always check hopper to see if I should go on vacation or not lol. I have yet to go on vacation, but this is the app I always refer to. | Let’s see what the peeps are talking about | It’s find the cheapest price and allow you to choose your favorite | Good to use and easy to search in varies ways | I use Hopper for ALL my travel bookings.I get a cheap flight ALL the time. | Title | I’m excited to see how cheap prices can get | Good price in offers | They let kid who under age of 18 to book the hotel.and  the kid is hiding and use fake adult  info to book the hotel. Then the agent manager said they don’t refund, other another hand, they allow people who is under age of 18 can check in hotel in the United States!  ALSO no one is answering my questions, and they are kick the balls between HOOPER and hotel. ‘Manager’ don’t understand their policy well, not professional at all! We even read the policy to him and he still don’t understand, how could let a person don’t understand how to process the customer’s needs. Cutting from my conversation, so rude and trying to cut my call ! | Hop on the hopper for travel deals AllllllllllllYeahhhhhhhhh | I’ve actually been using this app for years I don’t always purchase flights from the app itself but tracking the prices and getting notified when they change is really handy and I love the calendar that shows you what days are cheaper to fly. | Thank you for making travel a bit easier | This app is great, the discounts are fantastic and I greatly appreciate their service | I love the hopper app!

I love using the app and all communication from hosts to customer service representatives. Very professional and very helpful! | It won’t even let me book place to stay 😭 keeps saying error please try again how do you have a app that books places for people to stay and it doesn’t even let u use it🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️👿👿 | To be honest this app is average. When it comes to customer service AirBnB is abysmal! 

They outsource customer service to India, the support is slow, inarticulate, absolutely no help as they rely on their “specialists” whom you never directly converse with. 

I’m currently traveling and have been dealing with an issue with AirBnB that has gone unresolved for what now is going onto the 6th day - with x3 separate open tickets / claims with customer support. 

I’ve had to find and pay for premium accommodations as AirBnB provides no help beyond fake assurances and fake smiles. 

Proceed with caution when traveling abroad as they will leave you stranded on your own. 

Their is no way AirBnB will continue to dominate the space under this business model. | There are few if any protections for guests in the booking process. Hosts have the power to set ridiculous rules and choose exploitative policies that hurt guests most. Very difficult to plan group trips when hosts set arbitrary rules about visitors. Additionally, the refund/cancellation policy is nearly hidden until after you book and then you’re stuck in a bad deal. If Airbnb is supposed to be the better alternative to hotels, they need to at least put guests first. | Your support team has been little help and now me and my family don’t have a place to stay this weekend. We are doing some remodeling this weekend and will not have access to our utilities. We decided to go with Airbnb because I have a dog and not many hotels are pet friendly. They won’t let me book a place because of a “safety risk” that we might be having a party due to short notice. Why would I book last minute to book a party. I just want a place got my family while out home gets fixed. ZERO customer support, once I contacted them to try and resolve it the support lady simply read off a script that said summarizes to “to bad so sad” and “we sent it to the right team” . Might as well have AI answer their customer service | The hosting side of the app is terrible. Way too many issues. Booking as a guest is fine though never had any issues on that part | I have been a host for several years.  Generally good experience and the guests have been almost all wonderful.  However I did have one damage claim and got no cooperation or payment from AirBnB.  Very frustrating run around and very contrary to the assurances they give.  So just know you are on your own - they take the fees but do not support. | Trash app!! Don’t even let me book lol. | I love booking with Airbnb, it’s easy and has less fees than other sites! | First time using the Airbnb app.  We reserved an apartment located downtown San Antonio. Had great reviews, pictures looked good and a 4.9 on cleanliness. We arrive to our Airbnb and noticed the floor would creek pretty bad. There was dust everywhere. We found hair also in some places. The sofa was covered in stains & crumbs. There was a towel in the washer (only had a washer) the dishwasher was very dirty also the keurig, the bed sheets seem dirty too. It obviously looked like the place has not been cleaned in a while. We didn’t even stay for an hour there. I let the host know, also taking some pictures for evidence. I didn’t get every single thing because I thought the ones I did take were enough for anyone to tell this place was not cleaned. The host ends up telling it was cleaned that day and to send the pictures. He then told me I had to speak with Airbnb customer services because I asked for a refund. They end up telling me I can not get a refund because it was “minor cleanliness” and only cared if I had a picture of the towel in the washer but not the sofa that had stains all over.  I couldn’t even get a partial refund. Airbnb only cares about the host and will side with them even if they are in the wrong. THEY DELETED BAD REVIEWS ON THEIR APP. | They cared and fixed the issue that we had. | It used to be a good way to book reasonably priced accommodation these days you can book a hotel room for less😂 | The problem with AirBnb can be summed up by saying it could potentially ruin a vacation or save a vacation with many factor built in between. Firstly it’s layered as to who to blame.  First there are AirBnb policies and then there are hosts.  A hotel for example may clearly state the rules and allow rearranging travel because they have many rooms available.  Airbnb just has the one place you booked with a host who has options to rearrange, change, or refund.  Also those hosts aren’t necessarily great when it comes to customer service.  For example if you get sick and need to move a reservation around hotels and airlines are understanding.  Airbnb host might just take your money and run with no recourse other than a bad review.  Which AirBnb favors the host because you cannot sort by good or bad reviews.  It gives the average rating and then you have to sort through to find the bad reviews.  While I have experiences reasonable host who are accommodating.  I have also experienced a host who just took my money for no services rendered. This is the reason why I cease to use AirBnb ever again. | Love this app. If anything happens they take care of you! | This app is amazing I love looking at houses hotels and it is so relaxing to look at  when you are bored | Some of these hosts have the most insane cancellation policies found nowhere on earth - 50% refund if cancelled at any point in time, 100% upfront. Not only that, but you can’t even review the host after interacting with them. I will never use Airbnb again - see ya | Airbnb is the worst they will lock your account for no reason and the customer service doesn’t do anything to help time for them to revamp their company | Watched all the homeowners in my town use this to make more money by letting people stay in homes while the locals moved into hotels and cars. Kinda messed up and total waste of resources. God help us. | Hidden fees not shown until checkout. Other companies like booking.com and vrbo show the actual “price total” upfront on the map view. After cleaning fees, airbnb fees, and taxes, some listing totals double in price (which is insane anyways), so that should all be more visible when viewing map view. | The blocked me from booking at all because a comment I said celebrating me in my spouse alone for peace for his birthday they said it could lead to party’s so I’m not allowed to book any houses so I most definitely deleted this account you guys makes us leave comments then take the account away from your ai that can’t read correctly | Love the interface design. The best design in the industry. Just waiting for them to verify listing to weed out fake listings. It’s not that hard. They have the technology for it. I just don’t know why they don’t do it.

I also don’t like the fact that I cannot see what I made last year. 

I would like for them to show me what dates people like to view the most on my calendar. | This app is a mess. Try to search for a location then click on one…. Who knows where you end up. Date selection is a disaster. Even if you want a destination it always defaults back to “map view”. | Party house . I don’t know who’s renting this out to kids? Over 100
Kids at party in a family neighborhood. Cops
Called,Guns found. 100 kids running from cops at 1:30-2:00 Am .
Helicopter overhead .This in not acceptable in a family neighborhood. This needs to STOP! Please close this bnb | Trust me | You pay with real money, but when you cancel, they give you credits that you can’t even withdraw. It’s really disappointing how the costumer service can’t even solve an issue with the host. | After getting scammed by a host, airbnb sided with the scammer, threatened to cancel  account, and kept my money which is basically stealing. I spent an entire year complaining ti customer service, and they kept promising to fix the problem only to ghost me over and over again. | The app is over 200 MB | Todos los lugares que voy la uso | Price filter in app is nonfunctional. Ridiculous bug for an app like this. | We had one of the worst experiences using AirBnB with an absolutely terrible host and AirBnB was a joke to work with. They do not protect their customers over the hosts which allows the hosts to get away with dirty properties, false listings, etc. and there is nothing you can do about it. We won’t be booking with them again. | I am a superhost of a monthly rental. Unless someone selects monthly rental my house doesn’t pop up at all. There’s a yearly event near my house that lasts 3 weeks. Housing was low and going for very high rates, but unfortunately for me my house is sitting empty because Airbnb won’t show my house unless somebody specifically request a monthly rental or input dates that exceed a month why not homes that are available in the area that are not meeting the criteria so that someone can still click on your house and see why they don’t meet the criteria whether it’s unavailable dates or maybe they would change and add an additional weekend so that they can get housing in an area where housing is extremely limited now there are a bunch of people that need housing that never found my listing and I know I’m not the only one because I’m in real estate and I’ve had people calling me in the area that are having the same problem with Airbnb not showing their listing unless it’s over a monthly rental. Because of this, I’ve listed the house on the local MLS because now it’s sitting empty. Lost revenue for hosts, Airbnb, and also people that need housing won’t find it because it doesn’t show up. | I had a burglary in Walnut, CA while staying with Airbnb. The evidence and police report proved it’s previous tenant broke in with passcode (the Airbnb host never changes password). We have lost our bags and even a car. Although car has been recovered, it has a stolen record on carfax. Airbnb and host started ghosting us since then. Disgusting they couldn’t do anything and let users bear all the losses. | I have been a user of the platform for years. Never encountered a problem (probably my own good luck).  When an issue finally arose, I was met with silence, and then what I can only describe as an automated, generic massage from what seems like a robot. Shame on you the company for allowing customer service to get this way.  Taking my business elsewhere.. | Title: Great Concept, Disappointing Execution

I genuinely love the concept of Airbnb and the unique travel experiences it aims to offer. It's a fantastic idea that has the potential to transform how we experience new places. However, I am deeply disappointed with how the platform operates, particularly when it comes to customer service and its arbitrary process for handling disputes and bans.

During my last experience, I encountered serious issues that highlight these flaws. The customer service for guests was not only abysmal but also completely opaque, leaving me frustrated and without clear answers or support. Even more distressing was the arbitrary nature of how bans are issued. I had an ex who misused the platform to stalk me by pretending to be a neighbor and even escalated to calling the police on me, leading to my undeserved ban from the platform. This situation was handled poorly, with little to no investigation or consideration of context, which was incredibly disheartening.

Adding to the disappointment is Airbnb's lack of a loyalty program, which feels like a missed opportunity to reward frequent travelers. When faced with the choice between an often too-early 10 or 11 AM checkout at an Airbnb and the flexible 4 PM checkout that Marriott offers for Titanium members, the choice becomes increasingly clear. The lack of such benefits, which are standard among hotel loyalty programs, makes Airbnb less attractive in comparison.

While I remain a fan of what Airbnb aspires to be, these significant shortcomings make it difficult to trust and rely on their service. It’s regrettable because I truly appreciate the innovative approach to travel Airbnb promotes, but without improvements in transparency, fairness, and guest benefits, it’s hard to see myself using this service in the future. | I love Airbnb as a traveler and as a super host! The honest reviews and photos assure me especially when I travel alone that I know what to expect. Especially when it comes to other super host properties and the host themselves I know I’m getting the inside of local eats and things to do! | I’ve always used AIRBNB when I travel until recently. I stayed at an Airbnb in downtown LA during a trip. Knowing it was going to be shady finding parking plus the fact that I had rented a Porsche and wanted it garage, I immediately checked the “has parking” option as that was the most important thing to me. 

3 hours before I checked in, the “host” told me that I no longer had parking (I could no longer cancel at this point) he told me I would need to park a block away in an unsupervised lot and pay extra. He told me. Obviously this wasn’t okay, but I tend to let things go with the flow instead of cause a problem so I gave it a chance. Downtown LA is so unsafe and not only did this host lie to me and say it was in West Hollywood, it was a few blocks from skid row full of homeless people. The next day I found that someone had scratched my rented Porsche and was charged for the damage. After taking to I kid you not 10 different employees each asking me to explain my situation when they could have easily keep past conversations in file was sloppy. I spent a lot of money with Airbnb and all of it was a lie. I have no doubt the actual renter of the condo stored his own car in the spot he advertises for and hours before someone checks in, he cancels your spot.
I felt very unsafe walking a block to my Airbnb alone at 1am after meeting with friends when I expected to have a safe garage space. 

AIRBNB sided with their renter and I will never rent you airbnb again. Honestly hotels are now… better at least I know what I’m getting, VRBO is great as well. | This app is incredible but I am no longer getting notifications since the last few updates- which impacts me as a host! I have tried to fix it from the app, from my iPhone setting, uninstall, reinstall- nothing is working. It’s a huge flaw that impacts my experience! | One of my favorite apps ever. I appreciate how many features the host experience has yet still feels lightweight and straightforward. | This app is great if everything goes as planned. But if your place is dirty, with trash in the pool. You only get one day of pool heating even tho you paid for two. They don't help with anything. Our power even went out for an entire day with no explanation. Airbnb have no help. Told me to request my own money back from the host? That's just weird? They also just ended the conversation when I asked to talk to someone higher up and just kept telling me to figure it out on my own. | DO NOT book with Airbnb. If you are trying to save money by staying at an Airbnb instead of a hotel, STAY AT A HOTEL!! It is reliable, safe, and filled with real customer service people.

I have had plenty of good experiences with the platform until recently. After having to leave a booking due to unsafe property conditions, Airbnb did not provide a refund from the host. 

We requested reimbursement for our alternative housing and communicated with Airbnb customer service for 3 weeks straight. We sent them video and photo evidence via email multiple times and they continued to deny that they recieved anything. Every time we sent a message there was a different representative and it was entirely written by AI, with grammatical issues and repeated phrases expressing how ""sorry"" they were in many different ways. They would also call me at odd hours of the day/night. Lastly, they denied that we reported the concern in time and kept on requesting information that we had already provided. | Airbnb isn’t even worth using anymore due to the insane hidden fees. The cleaning fee basically doubles the price of the stay and there’s no way to see it while searching. | airbnb should understand that their platform became successful because host were using their platform. Travelers would go with the cheapest and most convenience place listed my property on Airbnb after one month customer service is horrible. They’re not trained and all they care about is closing the ticket. | Well, I have been with Airbnb for almost 10 years. But last year I stayed with a woman in Norway who was racist and nasty to my friends and I. She left me a ridiculous review and I tried to explain to Airbnb that I had 24 amazing reviews. And on February 5th, they deleted her comment finally. When I logged onto my account months later, I realized that the comment was miraculously back. I called and asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told no. And even though I asked over and over again why the comment was put back, they just said nothing. So I am done. I have heard from friends about Airbnb leaving them in unsafe circumstances and I should have quit at that point. This is just scary to me and Airbnb needs to change their way of doing business. But someone will need them and that will continue. | I had to cancel a reservation because there’s no elevator and it wasn’t specified on the listing. Airbnb refuses to give me my money back. Blatant violation of the American Disability Act. Nobody cares at customer support. Filing a dispute with my credit card company | Annoying and don’t upgrade. Garbage map loading and if it ever loads. | Booked an AirBnB today and it said reserved, 3 minutes later it said my booking was cancelled and that I have to wait 5-7 days for my refund. Stole my money and now I am unable to pay for a place to stay until I get my refund. | I had a host harass and constantly contact me about nonsense and Airbnb didn’t do anything to help or assist me, insisting I just leave the Airbnb and pay for my own accommodation elsewhere. Not enough checks and balances there | Just google “can’t trust Airbnb reviews” and you’ll see what I mean.

My one and only bad review on this app over years of using it was removed. I had a horrible host and I left a polite but bad review but it was taken down within hours. Once I googled what was going in, it seems like there’s way too many having the same issue. Reviews for locations within the Airbnb app are taylored to help the host. One cannot post a bad review which is why you almost never see negative reviews if any. Do not trust this app, just go get yourself a hotel and save yourself the headache and the host ruining your vacation. Not all host are bad but because of how AirBnb handles reviews, it’s impossible to know if the one you’re getting is a good or bad host. | They charged me for two separate stays at the same exact time and said that they were “accepted” reservations though I never booked either myself. What made the situation weirder was that they were in the same complex for the same exact dates making it look like it was a scheme. I have been trying to get a refund for TWO months to no avail.

Those experiences are provided by independent organizations and people and not by Viator.

The app itself is very poorly designed. I wanted to search for tapas tours in Barcelona. If you just enter Barcelona you get 1000s of events, 99% of which are not tapas. You can filter by type of event but it wasn't all that helpful.

So, you try searching for ""Barcelona tapas"" directy. This gives you a list of one line each results. You click on and then want to check another result. So you click back but this takes you all the way to the top of the app, not back to the search results. So you click search again and now you have to manually enter ""Barcelona tapas"" again because the search history only shows the one result you picked, not the search terms you entered? Now you have to try to remember where you left off. Why don't the search results look exactly like the city results???

Other issues include that nothing is copyable. Needed to copy the address. not copyable. Description had urls in it of sites and apps related to the event. They are neither clickable nor copyable so you have to manually memorize them and type them into the browser or app being referenced.

It feels like the problem is the company had fooled itself by the high ratings. Those ratings are not for Viator itself though | We’re seniors and this is our first and most likely our last visit to DC. The convenience of reviewing, selecting and booking tours with Viator is so stress free! | Thank you,
 love being a repeat customer, I feel like you take care of me personally . | I was lucky enough to have a private tour with the very lovely and informative Roy. I enjoyed hearing all about the history of the temples, the mountains and his life here in Cambodia. Highly recommend Roy! | I’m deleting the app as Viator sells me tickets for tomorrow despite my filter for today.  Then, the are worthless in getting you a refund.  

I’ve spent thousands with this app but they put all of the work on their customers while they just step back and count the money.  Zero customer service.
  
Be careful to triple check that date before you purchase. | Even though the code was good through in of month it would not give me the 10 % on the new download app | I love using the Viator app. It’s easy to navigate, has great photos, and quick access to honest reviews. Thank you for making travel even more fun! | After chatting with a rep ,
Imputing my info and cc number numerous times,
I was told to try a different cc. That produced the same result. Then it was suggested I wait 72 hours and try again. As far as holding the time of the tour we selected , they could not guarantee it. In spite of all that I tried one last time , and was successful. 
I hope it’s smooth sailing from now on! | I installed this app two days ago and I am about to delete it. Tried searching for bioluminescent kayak tours near Orlando knowing there are some out near Melbourne and it gives me results way out in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. When I change the search term to “bioluminescent Kayak tours near me“ I got zero results. | We just returned home for a two week trip in central America. We use Hector as a day car tour guide  when we visited San Salvador city

 he was prompt, and on time, picked us up at the hotel, clean vehicle was very passionate about the city and sharing all his inside knowledge as a local that actually lives on site, can’t say enough good things about Hector and his service 

The only downside it goes through violator and a third-party, which kind of garbles the communication on the front end, but we were able to crack the code and get the vouchers and everything sorted out the day of the actual tour | What a great site! I travel all around the world and this is so simple and organized!  The “booking.com” for activities!! | Thank you 🐴🤍♠️ | I recently booked the Albir, Altea, Benidorm & Calpe: Guadalest & Algar Excursion through Viator, and I must say, it was a huge letdown. The troubles started with the lack of accurate information provided by Viator regarding the meet-up point. Despite my efforts to clarify the meet-up location by calling, emailing, and texting a day before the tour, I received no response whatsoever.

On the day of the tour, the meet-up point had apparently been removed without any notice. Not even the digital ticket contained updated information. This lack of communication and support from Viator left me stranded and frustrated.

To exacerbate matters, when attempting to contact the tour company, they rudely informed me that it wasn't business hours, despite it being the day of the tour. When they finally did answer, they were unhelpful and dismissive, insisting that the information was in an email. However, I had proof through emails that the information they claimed to have sent was not provided.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply dissatisfied. Both Viator and the tour company displayed a lack of responsibility and poor customer service, making for a thoroughly disappointing and frustrating experience. | I love booking excursions with Viator. App is easy to navigate through and I find some great excursion in all places I have been to within and outside the United States. We used Viator for New Orleans, New York, Alaska ,  Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Dubai, Cartagena Columbia, Nashville and have never been disappointed! | I tried to contact customer support and our tour guide for 1.5 hours. The tour guide never showed and we received no information from customer support on the app or via email. | When I am promoted to login, viator does not return to the item I was in the middle of booking. | We loved the tours in Mexico City, but the app wasn’t as great. It pushed us to email and web browsers for tickets. | Booked tickets to Catacombs in Paris and Absolutely ridiculous how many hoops I had to jump through on this site that made me download app to prompt me get my tickets- then as soon as I downloaded, logged in with at least 2 email confirmations & a puzzle to solve, my tickets was a voucher to present at the site. Waste of 20 min of my time and highly annoying you have to do anything now days with an app. I’m using this once & deleting it. | Planning our excursions while in Greece was very easy and the customer service was amazing. | The app no longer takes passwords, requires email link which doesn’t work. Works fine in safari but forget using the app if you need to login. | Signed up for a number of experiences using the Viator website. So far so good. But when going to retrieve the tickets got caught in a maddening do-loop of “you must open the app to retrieve your tickets “ but app refuses to log me in once the emailed confirmation is complete. Finally found a way to download a pdf to myself after about an hour of frustration | Booked an overnight transfer from our hotel to the airport for a 7am flight. This was done the day before.
We didn’t have the option to select the pickup time which was worrying, and didn’t get a confirmation or anything. We realized that we needed to add a third person to our reservation so we called the transportation company(since viator doesn’t let you update anything)… and they tried to fix it. While on the phone, I asked them what the pickup time was since I still didn’t have an email and they said they would let me know within 30 minutes, since they hadn’t found a driver yet. The flight was 10 hours out, at this point…

An hour later, I got an email saying that the transport company was canceling the order because they couldn’t pick us up at 4am, and that we needed to book with “overnight transfer”, which was what we had selected to begin with. I believe that if we hadn’t called to add a person, we wouldn’t have heard anything until after the flight.

Viator now says they can’t refund our order because the time already passed. | The app is convenient but you’ll pay a 200% markup or more for tickets! | Fast and accurate. | Jalisa was our knowledgeable private tour guide at the Museums of American History and Natural History Museum.  She helped us enjoy and get up close to many interesting exhibits and brought them to life for us with her stories. We highly recommend this tour. | The authentication process is a loop of an email link to opening the app with tells you to log in which sends you an email which opens the app that tells you to log in. Over and over. | Easy to navigate. But should have deal button to browse quickly and add coupons for customers. | I rarely review apps but not sure how this one is at 5 stars. You can’t see vouchers in their app, there are tours where they won’t tell you the pick up point and sometimes for refunds they will ask you to talk to the tour operator.

Unreal. Better apps out there. Avoid. | I have booked several tours with this organization, and the tours are always great. In addition to great tours, their customer service and responsiveness is amazing. I will always use them. | I have used ViaTour in several different countries, including Australia/NZ, Europe and Asia, and have never been disappointed. On the few occasions I had had to cancel, the process was easy and full refund was received within two days. | Looks like it has some great activities but you can’t sign up as a single person, 2 is the lowest number of people in any of the tours I looked at. | My ticket ended being scheduled for a week after my planned one, not only the operator noticed when I asked for help neither they will refund you or allow you to use the $$ in a different tour. I didn’t even wanted the money but the tickets in a different day | The app itself is super handy, but it’s hobbled by its inability to add events to your calendar unless you let it have full calendar access. There is absolutely no reason this app needs to be able to READ every event on my calendar other than to collect and sell my private data. iOS allows you to set calendar permissions to “Add Events Only,” but the app won’t add events with that option selected. There’s no excuse for that. | In my opinion it is wrong for a company to block reviews they don't like under the excuse of ""community standards.""
I'm not alone. Read the most recent reviews. Lots of 1 stars. | Poor | Haven't gone wrong yet.  Great guides and always fun.  Have made new friends. | Book through any other travel site, and you will find a better price. Just test it for yourself and see that [Viator] has a huge markup. Further, when you send them quotes from other sites showing the better price, [Viator] will still refuse to match the price, even though it’s in their guarantee. | Having same issues as most recent review from Geoz777. Go into the app and it sends a link to email. Email link opens in browser and the app doesn’t recognize that the link has been opened, making it impossible to actually sign into my account on the app. 

Note to developers - maybe use a 4 digit code sent to the email that can be manually entered into the app for confirmation. The link thing clearly isn’t working as intended. | Got the app. It asks for my email. Then sends a link. I click on the email and it takes me to the browser version of the site. It recognizes me as a past customer. Then there is a link to the app.  Click on that link and it asks for my email. Start all over and can’t get out of the loop. Tried help but no links to customer service. 😵‍💫 | helped me book a fun affordable excursion for my trip ! | It will not work if you try to only allow access to add to calendar. It wants full access to your calendar. This is too invasive. Tours are easy to book and manage though, other than that | If your experience goes well then the app is great. I called support for help with a booking for them only to screw it up and cause additional problems. 

I was charged a different amount then the confirmation email and spoken with multiple people to try to resolve. I have received plenty of emails asking for reviews, which I have left. 
Activity: good
Viator support experience: terrible

I even asked for someone to contact me and have not been contacted. I spoke with someone today who was able to refund the difference of the cost to the correct amount on my confirmation email. 

If your still reading my advice: avoid 3rd party apps like this and book directly from the source | I used the website and app twice in Hawaii and in DC. The recommendations and descriptions have worked out each time. Enjoyed each tour and trip without a mishap. I always recommend it since. | We have always recommended and used Viator. | If you don’t know , this island can be expensive ,  but with this app I found all the amusement i was interested in for a very low exciting price so thank you so much for being so convenient towards my fun factor and my wallet. Also I  earned some dollar rewards towards my next purchases. That’s Awesome  , I’m enjoying this app and taking full advantage for my future adventures. 👍👍👍👍👍 | I booked a hot air balloon ride in Mexico City to see the pyramids in November. The tour company called me the night before to inform me I needed to reschedule. I could not as I was on travel and I requested a refund immediately. 

They didn’t answer for about a month so I disputed the claim on my card. Viator proceeded to fight (and won) my dispute and I’m now stuck with just under $500 in charges for services I didn’t receive. I’m never using this service again. | Major Bug

I really wanted to like it but the app is poorly designed. Once you enter a trip and locations, there is no edit option. You have to delete the trip and start over. I searched for a help section for instructions but the only choice is to ask on FB, Insta, or email. When I finally gave up and tried to delete my account, the app would freeze once I selected delete, thus not letting me delete. Negative stars in my opinion. | This app is fantastic. Saw someone using it on social media and wanted to give it a try. It is perfect to give yourself a rough draft of your trip or a complete day to day guide. I prefer to figure things out as I go, but there are many features that make it easier. Whether you are going on a family trip or backpacking across Asia, this app will be perfect for you. | Parts of this app I love, but it’s extremely limiting. For example, you can’t alter the dates between one destination to the next. Let’s say you’re taking a cruise and it takes 2 sea days to get from Singapore to Phuket, you can’t account for those 2 days in the planner, it only gives you a 24 hour option which is crazy. The next thing I don’t like is the app doesn’t sync from my phone to my iPad. This is extremely annoying. Whatever changes I make using my iPhone I’ll have to separately go into the iPad app and make those same changes. The third thing I don’t like about this app to the point I may just stop using it all together is every time I do ANYTHING in the app, such as pick a place to eat, the app will freeze for AT LEAST 2 minutes. I wish this app was way more customizable in terms of dates, in between places, etc like TripIt. What I love about it is how it will create a little video of your trip and you can visually see your route, I also love the suggestions like hotels, things to do, and places to eat…love those features. I’d be more than happy to pay for this if they make it better all the way around. | App does not render. Please help | I got the app, signed in with google and it’s stick on the Take Off screen after going thru the steps. When I close it, it wants me to sign in again. Was hoping this would be a great app for travel planning but these glitches make it a no go if I can’t even get into it! | Garbage! Good luck trying to even sign up! Complete joke 😜 | i’m writing this review before i finish planning my trip because i just love this app so far. it still seems like a work in progress but for the most part it’s fully functional! i wish there was a way to add what time you’re landing in the place at the beginning of the trip. if we were also able to see the time zones and the difference between then, that would be perfect. like the US has like 4 time zones and that’s confusing if you don’t know that and are planning a trip [wrote something here but erased it, they have a feature i didn’t figure out till now] overall it’s a cool app! if i could afford to travel more i’d use this app as my main planner instead of the google doc that i use. also note to developers: it would be cool if down the line there was a feature to export the trip as a pdf or whatever pdf file apple uses (pages? i don’t like it tbh). that would be awesome!

only complaint is about adding hotels. sometimes i press the plus, add a link, and it doesn’t show up. i think it saves to my wishlist… | I am trying to plan a trip for October 7th-24th of 2024. If I put those dates in, it wants my first night somewhere to be the 6th and won’t let me change it. We will be on a plane the night of the 7th so our first night under destinations I want to be the 8th. In order to do this I had to make our trip start the 9th. Our last night somewhere will be the 23rd but it told me I had 16/15 nights planned so I had to make the end date the 25th to get the planning itinerary right. This is messed up. My trip for the 7-24 looks like it’s for the 9-25th now for the countdown but right for the Nights planned section. Please correct this and allow us to adjust the nights planned dates for those flying overnight. If this is corrected I would give more stars but this is a really major flaw and doesn’t allow for any flight planning. | Love this app! Finally a user friendly way of planning my trip with friends! Thanks! | I’ve reinstalled several times and the app opens to a blank, white screen. | With this latest update, the app still does not load on my phone. It shows a white screen. | I’ve downloaded this app 3x and it won’t load past the opening white screen each time. I was very excited to try it. | The app looks cool but I’m giving up… you should have used Google maps to find the cities. So many of them can’t be selected even though they appear when exploring the map… why can’t we just add places as easily as finding them on Google maps? Same with finding hotels, very cumbersome… | The app is pretty cool. It allows you see the distance between your locations, add hotel info, track your spending and etc. which is nice and for planning a long trip it will help keep you organized. However, I’ve adjusted the dates of my trip and the new dates will not save. I have even deleted the trip and traded it and it will not save. | Wanted to input a 3-week trip itinerary through multiple countries and I was unable to create a trip directly. Instead, I had to select 1 of the five countries, then manually choose cities in the other countries via the search bar. One issue with this search bar, at the time I was using it, was that neither the capital of Kosovo (Pristina) nor the capital of Albania (Tirana) were options.

I’d have to say though, amidst its imperfections, it is actually a very helpful tool in visualizing how far apart ALL of the cities in your itinerary are, enabling you to make a more manageable trip that more accurately depicts travel times.",4.1875,64,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/c6/2b/cd/c62bcd58-98ac-9371-982a-8de46adb706c/4efa90cd-d1e7-4166-8808-2219bb0cb244_11.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/38/40/f5/3840f528-a57b-14bc-3c62-e600d833df5c/9efbe272-9087-4906-9d4b-0bd6632ad42d_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6c/b3/be/6cb3be61-4d1d-e5f2-f0fe-da613bcd4d3e/8bc5763e-261b-43ab-839d-2dcc65809d8a_0433.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/06/05/59/060559bd-0583-3e40-1537-543994966d7c/91c75ddc-f2b0-4425-ac02-43ce67911f19_0233.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ab/2d/e0/ab2de054-ed3e-06fa-b5a5-a9f344256e62/1731aead-93ad-4dde-a9db-894468bc89b4_12.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4f/2b/e4/4f2be4fc-e537-66b0-1c1c-46b03677d0d0/9c727ed3-0267-4d9c-9d9e-eee682612d86_05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/80/79/bf/8079bf2d-4879-9d2b-476f-a88070f3bdb7/453cdd54-5191-4d0a-a14f-69c589e7d782_08.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/3b/1a/c0/3b1ac0bc-fa3f-0721-03ad-72074f4f9b93/d44e1519-5337-49e6-9ddf-ca243188bcb4_06.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6d/fc/03/6dfc03b6-9857-588d-9fc5-647fbf328196/9be3afeb-819e-4199-a5a1-5aeb4cb9eb49_09.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/db/ba/71/dbba7115-11e2-3d48-2263-a3257d80aa8c/1e136b1b-5493-41c2-8ebb-46e0bb5dfd80_10.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"
