The app scanner tells me a product qualifies and the register at Walmart doesn't reflect what the app says. Twice we had to put items back that were not covered. Not a good introduction to UHC. I only added the app for the scanner. It doesn't work and has been no benefit whatsoever. I'll be removing it from my phone."",""App refuses sync with my tracker. It says connected. I've checked all permissions. And trying to reconnect just creates a never ending spinner. Data hasn't synced in days. How can you fairly offer rewards if the app is busted!? The fitness rewards was a deciding factor in switching coverage to my employers options. TERRIBLE CHOICE. There are only two doctors in my whole city, otherwise I have to travel out of state. And the features offered don't work. I'm stuck here for a whole year."",""The rewards feature is broken, Rally was much better. It will pull in data just fine and acknowledge you achieved daily/weekly goals, but will then fail to pay you what is owed. This happens at least once a week, sometimes with the big bonus rewards. 100% the apps fault, as it will even tell you goals are met. I take it there is little incentive for UHC to fix this as they don't want to give you the money."",""Completely non-functional. Sign in, it forces 2 factor every time even if you check remember device - you provide the code and it just spins on a blank screen. Tried updating the app, uninstall/reinstall nothing works. No feedback, no error messages just a blank screen with a spinning dial forever. If you close and reopen you have to authenticate again then it goes right back to the blank screen."",""incredibly slow despite wifi. external links to website cannot verify credentials despite being signed IN to both. PAY BILL button is literally lost in the tutorials and \""how-to's\"". this was such a mess. all because the automated system can't understand \""utilities\"" anymore. fantastic idea. but troubleshooting and maintenance are dire for success. if things improve, can't wait to update the review""]";false;false;false;"com.mobile.uhc";"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobile.uhc&hl=en&gl=us"

I've never had any issues with notifications, linking and syncing with other networks, combining children's patient profiles with parents.

Still puzzled why this hasn't received the prestigious **Editor's Choice badge. Seriously, great work."",""2024 Update: As a nurse, I must say that no one rivals EPIC in UI design. Still the champ of an intuitive and user-friendly system!! Wow. I really have to compliment the EPIC Corporation for this app! Smooth, intuitive, informative, and friendly UI. Has the many functionalities I need to review my health history with the clinic. What really impressed was the display of lab values which visually shows the normal range for each test. Keep up the good work App Team!"",""It would be an excellent app if it worked like it is supposed to. However, in my experience, most appointments can not be scheduled online, and if you ever try to message your providers, they never bother to respond. I want to edit my review. I think, in my situation, there are no problems with the App. I think that the problems are on the side of my Providers."",""This app would be a great idea if it actually worked. When I was entering my new insurance the app would not let me take a photo of the new insurance card. I tried numerous times to take the photo and each time the app would boot me totally out and take me back to the login page. I finally gave up! Then it wanted me to verify my phone number which has been the same for over 20 years but it never would send the code. This app has big problems and I don't like using it period!!
