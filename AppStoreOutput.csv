Thanks so much for using Delta! Glad to see everyone enjoying their favorite retro games :)","1.5.3s",0,"USD",true,333195245,"Testut Tech","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/testut-tech/id333195245?uo=4","https://deltaemulator.com",4.8979,"For the last 11 years, I have known of your project like the palm of my hand. I remember back in my grade school days when I first randomly found out about your work through a YouTube video, entering a link, manually mind you, to an OTA download of the GBA4iOS prototype. Ever since, I got immersed into the awesome and thrilling joy of retro gaming emulation, particularly on an iPod Touch 4th Gen (my hands were small, so it was comfy too!)

Years later, now in college, I had come back to the iOS ecosystem after spending most of middle and high school using Android, and I have found that your work changed its name to Delta, and boy, what a change with the respect to the times! New interface, new skins, more emulators, and even syncing to the cloud! Best of all, I like the fact that these games run smoothly and that you can apply cheat codes to trip around games.

Now, I am still shocked that Apple has finally loosened its belt, and allowed for your exceptional project and hopefully those of other faithful developers into the App Store! The smile I had when your app topped over TikTok in Entertainment must‚Äôve been worth a billion bucks.

All in all, I just wanted to pay my acknowledgments and everlasting thanks for the lots of fun I had in my childhood and nowadays, and for your once curious high school project and now remarkable contribution to the emulation and gaming community. I believe that this was a big factor that eventually inspired me to major in computer engineering. A hard and bumpy road perhaps, but I‚Äôve been getting at it the best I can. I wish nothing more than your prosperity in your future endeavors and that this story of success be known to many. Thank you, Riles. | The taptic feedback makes this app 10 times better for touch screen, I never thought DS would work so well on a phone. Happy to see emulation on iOS is off to a great start. Although sometimes there are some graphical glitches with MelonDS but you can fix it when hitting the menu button then resuming. | The app is excellent.
Aside from a few game freeze/crashing, the game (itself) is stable though out testing it.

Good job! | just missing a psp and ps2 and wii emulator for iphone | Todo perfecto pero solo falta eso | Please allow sound in silent mode though. | Please Apple let this live here forever and you shall be called Heros | Honestly, I am very impressed. Apart from figuring out how to get DS ROMs to play on the app, this app is crazy easy to use. I am looking forward to a iPad app and future support for older platforms. | It's one of my favorite apps ever. Thanks for doing all the hard work. | The only place I could ever play emulation was on PC, now I can play on my phone like I‚Äôve always wanted to! Loading the rom files are super easy, and the overall layout is seamless for both vertical and horizontal play! I‚Äôve had no issues with it so far. | I never thought I‚Äôll ever drop a review for an app. But this app deserves it 

I wish I could show y‚Äôall my screen timeüòÇüòÇ
Delta all day playing 
Smack down vs Raw 2010
Assassin Creed

And I was like kids in the 19‚Äôs are really cool 
I just wish I was born earlier

Thank You So Much Delta Team‚úäü´°

I hope we get more features soon

Yours,
Dolapo. | I used to use gba4ios back in 2012 and it has been so hard to just put it back on my phone without hassle. Cannot believe it finally happened! 10/10 emulation this is the best thing out there | Android has these apps for years way before they where mainstream now it's in ios which is cool! But took over 2 decades to have them officially in ios platform | This is amazing. I finally get to play all the retro games I ever wanted. One thing I would like is the ability to maybe upscale the resolution I know the phone can definitely run it so if it‚Äôs possible, please try to implement it or at least in some consoles like the NES. The only reason why I want this feature is to see more clearly and just a better gaming experience in general, please and thank you.

Edit: for all the people giving it bad reviews please note that this is amazing. You just have to know how to use it. If you have issues like no audio or crashing it‚Äôs not the emulator. It‚Äôs actually the game you have downloaded. Trust me happened to me before not all games you download work immediately somewhere just hacked and supposed to annoy you.

TLDR: it‚Äôs not the emulator it‚Äôs the games you download. | Amazing app, I just wish there was an iPad specific app | Ya nomas  falta que nos dejen descargar juegos de  PlayStation  para que sea una de las mejores apps en la App Store | Dont get me wrong i love playing games on old nintendo consoles and screemed when i heard of this app because i love older games but i just really want to play some games that are on the sega genesis or sega saturn or sega dreamcast or sega game gear mabye the playstation thats really the only problem I have with it though other wise I need to get more people to use this | This app is great i can play roms on my phone and airplay the games on my tv but sometimes the audio bugs out and when airplaying it freezes pls fix | This is the first emulator on iOS deserving of a five star rating. It‚Äôs been awesome, keep up the good work! | Beta testers should catch something like that | This app is amazing and I‚Äôm beyond excited it is finally in the App Store. | I have a small issue I have a custom landscape mode skin for the DS, but when i use my controller it overrides my custom skin to the default one, please fix this so I can use my custom skin with my controller. I‚Äôm using the Gamesir G8 btw | Love it | This is one of the very few apps I‚Äôve given 5 stars! Only one pick is installing the .bin files. If I hadn‚Äôt found someone to help, I‚Äôd have never figured it out. That being said, I‚Äôve never been happier with any app! Runs many retro games perfectly & I can even connect my PS5 controller to my iPhone & use it to play! Hope we get more emulators for other systems that are as good as this one! | Great, thank you developer. could be improved more | I‚Äôm so glad Apple allowed this native app. Brings back so many memories and nostalgia. Works great paired with a ‚Äúback-bone.‚Äù Can‚Äôt wait for Sega support. Keep up the awesome work! | Why don't you support Sega games? | So I know I already send a review and mentions a issue I had well I believe it may have something to do with the Fast Forward feature in the app when you go to save the game like example Pok√©mon Black Version  in which the game would crash before getting to save the game other then that the app works well 

Thank you for making a way for me to relive my childhood and hope you have a great day. | Well done app. Not just saying that from an iOS emu high. | very happy for this to finally arrive in the appstore, love the devs!! | I will never forget side-loading GBA4iOS on my 4th gen iPod in 2013. It was amazing to play Pok√©mon on a smart device.

Now look at how far you have come, Riley!

I am proud of you. | That‚Äôs the review. | It does what is supposed to, and more. | Thank you for bringing this experience to apple devices. This is the best app on my phone hands down!!! | i wish there was 3ds support | I‚Äôve been using Delta for years courtesy of AltStore and when I heard that it was made official, I had to download it. It feels a bit surreal to be using a sanctioned emulator with the quality and care that I have come to love. Great work as always and I that it makes its way onto Apple TV too! | Thanks a lot for bringing the app in App Store. Appreciate it | I been wanting so long for an emulator for the iPhone and now it is here, almost cry, excellent interface and performance, a must have. | I‚Äôve used a few others on my computer and this is the best one for the consoles it supports, love all the options such as skins and air play settings. Keep up the good stuff B) | I really enjoy using this emulator as I could run a bunch of classics games.  Easy and simple to use and hopefully we‚Äôll get to emulate sega games next | I said it‚Äôs good | Great emulator | So easy to use, an important facet of media preservation and the continued enjoyment of games long past. | I cannot express enough just how grateful I am for all the hard work the Devs have poured into Delta. 

It is refreshing to finally have a legitimate emulator in the App Store. I can‚Äôt thank Apple enough for permitting emulation üôè üòä 

Thousands of people are reliving happy moments with the ability to finally have a safe and flawless way of playing their childhood favorite games. 

Thank you Devs for all you have done ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | It‚Äôs a great emulator thanks for your job, I downloaded on a iPhone 7+ and I can‚Äôt get any sound ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è don‚Äôt know why I try all to see if I can get sound but I couldn‚Äôt can you guys check if it something wrong with delta or it‚Äôs my iPhone 
Again thanks for your work it‚Äôs amazing! | Great | Delta will be the best emulator for your time. | I really like this app and i just want to say that if y‚Äôall can add PS2 games to itüòø | I have my fingers and toes crossed hoping one day soon you‚Äôll allow PlayStation games | WOW! Please add more emulators and Apple TV version!",4.8979,13017,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/35/c1/5a/35c15a1b-09a4-4264-b1c9-6b10436a9a77/499c9050-a8ed-4502-877d-90c3208ad41a_65600448-f7d9be00-df54-11e9-9e3e-d4c31296da94.PNG/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e3/53/8b/e3538b2d-c0be-999a-0288-3b15ef0aa0e2/48ea04d1-c9e1-42de-a433-c09730a21f8e_65813009-f2ae8600-e183-11e9-9eb7-704effc11173.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/41/72/26/417226f7-2c5c-13d6-fe35-5d2a4b59616b/27200f4d-72d5-48d8-8c6e-b5299e3e4c74_65601117-58b5c600-df56-11e9-9c19-9a5ba5da54cf.PNG/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/08/87/2d/08872dc8-3f55-7e59-3d26-576150b20647/b111343b-9130-47e0-a6e1-4253ea71b7b7_65601125-5b182000-df56-11e9-9e7e-261480e893c0.PNG/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

But most importantly, the vast choices of items. It saves me browsing through the store aisles looking for the perfect, gist, outfit or gadget. | Great prices. No hassle returns. Clothing true to size depending on style. | hago mis compras y me llegan puntuales y completas.
Adoro los productos muy satisfecha con la app . | Both products were very good! | Ordered a few things at first. Loved the items so much and now I order every 2 weeks. Love their products! | Great bargains , all the items were better than expected. So far no complaints | Love the app! | Do you guys use or take pay-pal???? | Just want to say that the items I received (all tops) are all of poor quality material. I don‚Äôt have a printer to return so I will donate them. | It‚Äôs fun to shop- I was a little confused with their specials as it said get ‚Äú$90 free‚Äù but then I had to buy hundreds to get it and that wasn‚Äôt disclosed, it just kept making me buy more to reach milestones and then some wouldn‚Äôt even get higher. So that‚Äôs the only reason I gave it 3 stars is their rewards is kinda gimmicky. It says you get free gifts, but after you jump through hoops of picking it will ask you to refer friends , you do that but you don‚Äôt get the gifts unless one of the friends uses your link to buy things- which of course again isn‚Äôt disclosed forthright. 

I‚Äôve only received a few items so far but from what I‚Äôve gotten some have been hits, some misses. But overall, of course for the price, I can‚Äôt complain. The app really gets you to want to buy things. | I Love and Am Addicted to TEMU!!!
Thank you for EVERYTHING!!! | Love my items | Good app, home decor items are wonderful 
Some of the clothing is not what was expected | My item it‚Äôs broke | Love the process and super reliable | Ok so I got a package for free and it came on time and it was free I love it too it‚Äôs so perfect y‚Äôall should do ittttttt | Fast and fun!! | Great values and easy returns | Things aren‚Äôt true to size, I‚Äôm receiving items that looks different from what I have ordered online. | Spend more money than I should but items are 90% of the time way worth it! | Execelente | This app is nothing but a scam. Chinese website used to track Americans cause we‚Äôre the best | I HATE THIS APP! | Todo lo que he comprado me ha encantado 
Y muy recomendable. | So many amazing things at great prices. Their delivery is fairly quick and they literally have something for everyone. Return process is easy as well | I absolutely love my shorts. I‚Äôve always been buying other things. I‚Äôve tried the short because I‚Äôm going to Myrtle Beach and I absolutely love them. Thank you so much. If I knew I can get them before 17 May I‚Äôd order some more of them. | Tried to change my shipping address on an order I just placed and you divided my order in two different orders ????   Was able to change my shipping address after soooo many try‚Äôs on the items listed under order 2;  but couldn‚Äôt 
get to order 1 that has most of the items I want üò°. Your website is a joke!!!!   The reason of all this problem is I was in Florida for only 3 months for the winter and you somehow didn‚Äôt let me modify my shipping address when I placed the order.   Leaving for Texas next week and the items won‚Äôt be here by the time we leave.
WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM YOU AGAIN!!!!!!!!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° | Please don‚Äôt use this app they won‚Äôt give you what you paid for and it‚Äôs hard to get your product as well as any | Es un buen programa tiene muchas cosas interesantes y bonitas varatas y rapida entrega | S√∫per buena esa aplicaci√≥n de Temu me gusta mucho gracias por la atenci√≥n üôå | Supero mis espectativas todo llega bien y r√°pido | A lot of the items I get from two are exactly as described every once in a while as is with any website like this, you know you get some stuff that comes not as described. Temu took care of it right away no questions asked. | Delivery is nice and pretty quick | I‚Äôm amazed at the gifts I ordered. There exactly what I ordered. Swimsuits, rings, bracelet. All are fantastic at a Great affordable price. Thank you, the only thing I would add is that the sunglasses and the men‚Äôs cologne be better packaged. | All the products I have purchased have been as described. Packaging was not damaged. So far all items have been as suggested in the descriptions.  Will buy again | Thank you! | I have not sent back even one item Iv ordered. Everything Iv ordered is exactly what the site said it would be. Thank you Temu. | They got everything I‚Äôm looking for | Me encantan los art√≠culos y el servicio | Great prices always takes care of their customers if there is a problem good quality merchandise highly recommended | The app is amazing, they do have a little too much advertisement. And could be a little more user-friendly, but other than that no issues whatsoever. | Never disappointed! | Easy to use, great deals; you get so much just by spending so little | I am pleased with both purchases so far, I will admit, I was skeptical at first, but TEMU delivers!  
       I just wish the delivery was faster. | I have ordered several times and I am always amazed at the quality and price. | Finally I can afford to shop! | I like shopping from Temu it‚Äôs just the wait that take so long to come.. | So far I have been pleased with the products I have ordered.  I had one item arrive broken.  There was no problem getting a refund, I just sent them a photo of the broken item.

It lets you know the message has arrived, you can see the preview, but it takes another minute for it to actually show. Also impossible to search for previous phone calls or messages. The search algorithm is completely useless. I don‚Äôt understand why this company is not able to create a better product when others exist (so obviously it‚Äôs possible and it‚Äôs not an issue of the platform) that are way better, such as Whatsapp. There you can easily search for previous phone calls or messages and messages appear immediately.

Because of it, I can‚Äôt access my account on there unless I click certain buttons, and neither can I use the search bar because of the stupid screen pushing it up. Plus, why the heck would need the search bar moved down like that? Because people are stupid and to lazy to stretch their fingers to reach the top of the screen? Probably not, but it‚Äôs insanely annoying. 

I know they‚Äôre probably not gonna fix it, but atleast make it possible so I can reach certain parts of my screen. | So I have facemoji but I'm not sure if you want to have Google üîçand I'm so glad that it has the Dino game that's showed at the no internet connection screen | I‚Äôve used the google app for a while and haven‚Äôt experienced any problems with it before, but lately I have been experiencing this strange bug on the app. Every-time I run the app it becomes unresponsive for a least 10-15 seconds, just frozen.

Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what‚Äôll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you‚Äôre interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things ‚Äî or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world.

A few things you can do on Threads‚Ä¶

‚ñ† Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

‚ñ† Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

‚ñ† Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you‚Äôre interested in.

‚ñ† Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you‚Äôve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we‚Äôre enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

‚ñ† Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

‚ñ† Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it‚Äôs about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

‚ñ† Open social networking ‚Äì coming soon
In the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.

The problem is, this was a LIE. The thruway was NOT closed. I did a series of illegal maneuvers that definitely would have gotten me in trouble if a cop had seen me. And my six hour ride almost turned into a 12 hour one because it was going to make me go local. Add to this, that it is ALWAYS, at MINIMUM 20 minutes longer and $15 more expensive to go into NJ and take the George Washington Bridge into New York City from where I start, as opposed to staying on the thruway and taking the Tap (Cuomo, whatever üôÑ) and yet it has gone as far as telling me to turn around to backtrack, AS IM PASSING THE BRIDGE! In other words, I ignore the directions, proceed into the city, and when I‚Äôm already in the Bronx, this app wants me to get on the bridge to Jersey (no toll), just to turn around to take it back, AND PAY A TOLL! To leave me off where I started!!!!! How much does Google get in kickbacks from directing drivers to unnecessary tolls? I‚Äôm genuinely curious, because all those tourists who don‚Äôt know better- chaCHING! ü§ëü§ëü§ë | Stopped by today and renewed my membership.

We had an absolute blast on both of our fishing trips! Our first trip was a 4 hour offshore & a perfect day!

Eric was fantastic - super laid-back, entertaining and personable, but also incredibly knowledgeable about the local waters. He made the entire trip enjoyable, and most importantly, put us right on the fish!

We ended up catching a nice lil mess - enough to feed our group of 5! We reeled in some keepers..a nice grouper, flounder, some red & grey drum! Caught a bunch of other species that were released.

On the way back, we stopped to check his bait cages and found a cool lil seahorse in one! I loved that!

We had so much fun that we booked a 2 hour inshore trip,  a couple days later to get a different experience. It was equally as  cool. We went in and out of the inlets & mangroves & landed a nice 31 inch snook!

Both trips were well worth the money. Everything was included - fishing licenses, all the gear we needed, and even bait! 

We met Captain Eric at Annie's before heading out. They have a great selection of cold beers and delicious food, which was the perfect way to start the day. Great lil bait shop & they have Annie‚Äôs shirts & Gulfcart charters shirts to purchase..we bought a few of each! 

He cleaned & bagged the fish and we went home and cooked them up both times!! 

If you're looking for an unforgettable fishing adventure in Cortez, I highly recommend GulfCart Charters and Captain Eric! You won't be disappointed! | Very disappointed in Google Maps rush hour guidance in DC. It is well known that during the morning and evening commutes certain major routes near downtown DC are one-way in and one-way out. If you‚Äôre not a regular commuter, this dramatically changes the way you navigate across the city at these times. Yet the other day, Google tried to send me headlong the wrong way into a horde of oncoming traffic on Rock Creek Parkway. The resulting course correction sent me into a nightmarish tangle of clogged city streets. It is beyond belief that after all these years Google hasn‚Äôt adjusted to account for these daily temporary route changes. | The round numbers in the highway numbers are continuous.

Lag occurs when you load up app and seemingly lasts for 10 seconds to a minute. really frustrating when using for walking navigation and re-checking if you‚Äôre headed the right way. This issue started as a small inconvenience to me now just using apple maps because the issue is so maddening for an application that has such a large team and budget. | Somehow they have arranged it that if I refuse to download this app, I‚Äôm prevented from reading reviews of businesses on Google.

CapCut is truly amazing, it‚Äôs advanced and makes really good videos plus, it‚Äôs easy to use. Everything is clear what to do and how to use it.  CapCut creator program is another amazing story! The CapCut creator program lets people share their edits from CapCut. People use it to post or to make a template that you can replace the photos with your own. I personally use it for templates, to find a sound for an edit, and for inspiration! Then again, I would 110% recommend CapCut! | I love this app it‚Äôs so much fun to use. | Nice app easy to use | CapCut is not my thing but ok | CapCut has help me better edit some of my videos with sounds, fonts, and more!! I Definitely recommend for people who want to start editing!!!ü´∂üèªü´∂üèª | Hi capcut! so umm i redownloaded capcut because my lil sister deleted it.

And i had templates before. i use templates for social media. this is really dissapointing. | Good editing use peoples templates | 5star | This is the frost app that I‚Äôve edited on and it helped me soooo much I really do enjoy this app üíïüíìüíû | Capcut is so funny it has tiktokers and more! You should get CapCut it‚Äôs great! | :) they told me to :) | It is the best for me and me friend symone | I love this editing platform | I love this app . It is perfect for what I do | This app is creepy and is trying to upload your photos library. | Capcut is freenand easy you littery get templets witch your can edit or just keep it and post on solsal meda with gets you a lot of veiws | GET the app it‚Äôs so cool | MAKE MY LIFE Easier | The only downside is you have to pay for some things | I‚Äôm fairly low tech, and I am able to produce engaging content with the help of CapCut. | Awesome | ‚Ä¢SUM OF CAPCUT‚Ä¢

Hello parents! CapCut is basically TikTok in a more childish way. You may SEE inappropriate content as you would TikTok, or YouTube, but CapCut IS much more preservative about taking down the inappropriate things. Your child may create, and use templates with out an account, which means you cannot post. If your kid WANTS to post, and your okay with it, then you can figure that out.üíó

‚Ä¢MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE‚Ä¢

I have had a lot of fun making things on CapCut, and figuring it out. All in all, I have really enjoyed this app, though it isn‚Äôt for everyone. I would for sure rate this app a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.  (5/5) ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢RECOMMENDATIONS 4 YOU‚Ä¢

Only let your child on CapCut, if 10+, maybe older. Maturaty plays a big role in when or why you‚Äôd let your child have this app.ü´ß

‚Ä¢CONCLUSION‚Ä¢

I would personally let my child get this. Although. Your kid can search things they want too, there are privacy settings and such to help. I hope you find this helpful, and I hope you consider letting YOUR kid on CapCut üåà | Easy to learn how to use. I learned on my own. Fun to use! | 5/5 | If you ever wanna make some cool videos, this is the app for you I just wish they had more free options when it comes to me doing my videos but other than that I like it but I just want more free options so I can be able to really make some really really cool videos | You can edit videos make templates watch templates many many fun things to do really great for funny memes and shorts. I deeply recommend getting it. I spend hours on it a day.

      -froggylover#1 | I‚Äôm gonna give this app five stars because I love editing | I‚Äôve been using CapCut for while now, after this new update I don‚Äôt get 2 free uses everyday anymore. 
Then you offer for me to share it to get a free use, and the app continues to tell me that I didn‚Äôt share it and won‚Äôt get my free use? It‚Äôs posted 10 times on my Facebook. 
After new update this is trash. | It‚Äôs amazing but I hate it says cap cut pro | Amazing | Best app wver | The best editor. I‚Äôve recommended to at least 5 people. The option to use other amazing templates is a game-changer | Hola | We use this for our church and absolutely love it ! | This is the best editing app because there is so much more choices in fonts and stuff unlike VN. | I love creating videos and editing,making templates has become my favorite pass time . I‚Äôm hoping that I soon start getting rewarded, I just want to know why I‚Äôve not gotten any pay at all.. I‚Äôm a ruby creator and I add templates everyday,and do submit challenges , shouldn‚Äôt I be getting something by know. | So I make cvc and geo edits and recently I‚Äôve been having problems with using animations for overlays and backgrounds. If my WI-FI goes below 3 bars, animations will just not work for some reason and I don‚Äôt know why‚Ä¶

I would really hope that this is fixed as soon as possible!

But still this app is great! | Okay | Love | Nice app, it‚Äôs my go to app for basically anything video editing | The best | Ahora todas las plantillas de subt√≠tulos me salen en PRO ?? Cual es el problema??? | CapCut is great it‚Äôs just idk how to make my own template that is my only problem I love all of the fonts my favorite one is the honest font and all of the editing styles are great and there are a lot of great editors out there on CapCut because of the wonderful app! I hope even MORE people discover CapCut and become great editors!!-evan | This one of the best apps Iv‚Äôe ever used | This app is awesome üòÜ‚úÖ because I upload god videos and I want spread the word of God | CapCut is user friendly üíïüíïüëçüëç | Very easy to learn‚Ä¶ has tons of cool features and effects video + image editing‚Ä¶ arguably the BEST creative app out now.

And worst part can‚Äôt get my returns. | Clothes are usually great, prices are great, however, if you need to reach customer service, good luck. There is no such thing with this company. They tell you repeatedly they‚Äôll email within 24 hours and you‚Äôll never hear from them!!!!! | Customer service does not exist and they do not solve problems you pay for shein club and it glitches At first it was ok a lot of items are cheap like dollar tree . Delivery takes over two weeks . Also when you pay in full for the club benefits they never work the customer service is slow & they dont solve the problem yes some clothes are cheap but the material isnt meant to last. The site also has a lot of fake reviews ppl write for points and there is always a glitch. | If you are looking for lowest quality of any product, go to SHEIN.
SHEIN will place a nice quality for add and then send you lowest quality of clothes,I regret wasting my money with SHEIN.

I wish I can return this trash back to you people | He tells me that I have created many accounts with the same number or I have used applications that are not valid but I have only created an account and I block I would be very grateful if you could help me unlock my username so I can continue playing | the game puppy keep is annoying. you‚Äôre awarded a free gift, & at first it goes by quickly, but towards the end it just gets harder & harder making you not even want to finish it. which in return pushes me away from even wanting to order anything. get it together. | they are very shady with returns and you want to return 80% of their products due to its low quality. Item says refundable but when you go to the  cart there js no way to return some of their items. And customer service doesn‚Äôt do anything about it. Its just robot when it comes to return certain items and you can‚Äôt talk to anyone. Horrible and very angry | I have been shopping on SHEIN since it first began. I have never had an issue; but as of lately it has gone downhill so fast. First, they only sent me my accessories after charging me for my entire order including clothes. It took me two weeks to finally get a refund and I had to put each individual ticket in to get a response. DONT even bother playing their games. It‚Äôs an absolute SCAM. They get you to sign all your friends up to shop with them and then last minute when you try to put in your last couple friends to win the competition they give you error messages but still sign them up for the app. They like to exploit you. When you try and reach out to them for assistance because you worked so hard to win the prize. They have you send a bunch of ‚Äúevidence‚Äù then deny your request no matter how much you show. This was my favorite app and now I‚Äôm geniunely going to delete it. I won‚Äôt support that kind of buisness | Literally my go to clothes shopping place. Have bought laces from here, hats, jewelry, jeans, shirts, and sweaters and always great quality. | Does this have orders for kurrdistan,please do. | But otherwise than the clothes there very awesome and every time I order it fits me perfectly but one problem I have is for example my cart is $219.85 plus the $35.00 shipping it equals to $295.84 and when I add the $40.00 coupon it‚Äôs still a high price put I just feel like the shipping can go down a little bit because people cart doesn‚Äôt be expensive is when the price for shipping is being added that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs expensive | I HATE YOU SHEIN | I did not see my order picture it is like it disappeared üòíüòí | ive made the decision to delete this app. i realllly loved shein and have been shopping here for yearsss. but i cant do it anymore the material is sooo cheap. like the t shirts and the hoodies is like this silk almost material and its so thin and cheap and it a literal hair and fuzz magnetic. big L | I‚Äôm SORRY BUT WHERE IS MY STUFF?????? IT SAYS THERE LIKE I WROTE WRONG ADRESS, BUT IT IS NOT WRONG!!!!!! WHERE IS MY PACKAGE????? AND WHY CANNOT I EVEN GET MY MONEY BACK? GIVE ME MY MONEY OR STUFF BACK! TEXT ME ON MY EMAIL | It‚Äôs a total scam I spent a whole 14 days playing too win my free item and it made me spend 100 coins a million times just for 0.01 of a point don‚Äôt waste your time | I love SHEIN very cheap and convenient just wish the shipping wasn‚Äôt 4 dollars | I‚Äôve heard a lot of things about Shien and how it‚Äôs really good for only cheap prices but the package I got was not to my satisfaction. The jeans I bought look like they were just cut from scissors. I will say their sweatshirts are really, really good. They are very comfortable and soft but from Shein, I do not recommend their jeans. | Don‚Äôt know how anyone could like there stuff they always give the wrong size to big or to small waste of money | The app is great. What I don‚Äôt like is, with all the options on here, there are not many for tall people. At least give more options for tall women or men. Some of the clothes are really cute though. I‚Äôd give it more stars if they were inclusive to all. | I love this app but the games are ridiculous all that work and sending out invites and never win anything is crazy to me what if you don‚Äôt talk to that many people it‚Äôs sad | I ordered on April 4 for some reason my account was deleted. I paid on my credit card $41 and have not received anything to date 26 April. | You people steal all of your ideas from local shops and other online shops nothing you do is original | I love the SHEIN App. I'm pleased that I can purchase everything for my family within a reasonable budget. From trendy clothing for my teenagers to cute accessories for my little ones, SHEIN has it all. I love how easy it is to navigate the app and find exactly what I'm looking for. The quality of the products always exceeds my expectations, especially considering the affordable prices. I highly recommend SHEIN to anyone looking to update their wardrobe without breaking the bank. | i fw shein i been with them since i‚Äôm was in 4th i‚Äôm going to be a freshman soon but i was tryna use a gift card and now they don‚Äôt take accessories etc things like that and i‚Äôm angry but overall it‚Äôs my fav app | The app itself is okay, but was referred by a friend trying one of the many offered ways to get free items. They want you to jump through hoops and make it harder and harder to get the rewards they claim are easy to obtain. The process made me want to delete the app before I even had the chance to shop. If they want ppl to spend more time or money on the site/app they need to make things easier to obtain not harder. They are losing many possible customers by playing with our time and making us disinterested. It feels like they‚Äôre all scams. | Shein is a big scam. you will never get a free item if you play there game. all the games are scam. there shipping quality is worst of all. the app is useless. and we are also boycotting shein because they forced Uyghurs to work over time. So a big No To shein from USA and totally not recommend. | Dicen que me hicieron reembolso de mi dinero y no me llega, me robaron mi dinero no usen esta aplicaci√≥n | Every time I try doing some games so I can get free stuff it always tricks me and every time I think I‚Äôm close to wining it says ‚Äúyou get 0.01+ and have to do 0.09 more‚Äù like if you say a user equals 1.00 then why every time I put a new user or old one then why in the world!!! Also they always pull the cards and put like 10+ , 5+ , 1+ and when you click one they put 0.01+ like that was an option but it wasn‚Äôt false advertising. | I HATE IT NOTHING IS FREE | Idk why but every time I try to place a order something is always wrong and it deletes everything I have in my cart ! It‚Äôs so annoying | Sheen loves to scam, people and extort money. I played a mini game in the app and she said I cheated which I did not, and did not give me the reward and waited till after I was done playing the game to tell me that I cheated and I was getting anything, so I was in customer service for a week talking to reps for at least an hour day. I talked to like 10 reps and they all told me the same thing that they would get back to me and they never did. I came in contact with so many rude and belligerent customer service reps And I am deeply disgusted by SHEIN . | They have practically stolen my money. I didn‚Äôt not get my shipment, I have tried calling and emailing with no help or response. My package is weeks late with no tracking, no questions answered, Nothing. They keep giving me a number that hangs up on me. THEY ARE A SCAM. DO NOT DOWNLOAD | So I was play Puppy keep and I reached to the end and it said it was expired | Nice app but my package was missing and I complained but instead they turned against me and told me nothing was missing, do I look like a fool or lier to you ? | I too was skeptical at first glance. I too have sent back somethings but the ones I kept were very nice. Like the lady said not all things fit or look right on everybody. Just like when you shop at brick and mortar, not everything you pick up fits or looks good. | It‚Äôs been 2 months & my account is still frozen. Despite great deals in Shein it‚Äôs been impossible to resolve this issue I even deactivated my account but that didn‚Äôt work. I wish I could speak to a human being smh!!!!! ***UPDATE customer service said my account is closed due to false reports & malicious refunds. But the refunds were because my debit card was compromised! I‚Äôm so upset üò° I e spent lots of money on this app & im a loyal customer any resolution would help | I live overseas and it took 2 months for 2 small things to arrive in my mailbox. The customer service was horrible too. Bad quality. Not recommended at all. | I love shein so much with all my heart it‚Äôs a good app | I feel terrible ordering things from SHEIN. I really do but when I know I‚Äôm gonna be rolling around in the mud like a dirty wook I just hate to spend a ton of money on something. Lost a star for the child labor. | Everything has been good quality and grate prices!!! I love this site I might be addicted to it lol.   I buy clothes, shoes and items for my home Ive even found a bathroom medicine cabinet and storage cabinet to remodel my bathroom and they were cheeper then other stores and the same quality I would of gotten any where else!  If you haven't explored Shein for more than Clothes I definitely recommend you do!!!! üòé | Why do y‚Äôall have that on the app for you not to give it out y‚Äôall are some lairs telling me to share and add new users and I did that just for y‚Äôall not to give me the full prize YALL full of It I‚Äôm going to temu | SHEIN has no policies in place for when shipping companies mess up! I lost almost $300 and my kids clothes because my package was delivered to the wrong address. I called FedEx who said SHEIN has to file the claim and SHEIN wouldn‚Äôt even check into this. They just said ‚Äúoh well, sorry‚Äù. Will not order again!!! | Una estafa total no compren aqu√≠ | Shien is a awesome app! It had awesome stuff for a good price I love shopping and looking at the stuff on it | IF YOU EVER NEED CONTACT SHEIN YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN !! I HAD TO CANCEL AN ORDER CAUSE THEIR PAYMENT SYSTEM WAS HAVING AN ISSUE AND I HAVE to add all  THE ITEMS BACK in my CART MANUALLY  TO THEN REALIZE WHATEVER PROMOTION I HAD BEFOFE, WAS GONE .. THE NEW TOTAL WAS OVER $50 AND AFTER CONTACTING SHEIN CS FOR OVER 1 HOUR THEY DID NOTHING .. PRETTY MUCH SAID F. Me and said I HAD TO PAY !! EVEN THOUGH WAS NOT MY FAULT AND THAT THEY COULD EASILY JUST CREDIT THE AMOUNT DIFFERENCE IN MY ACCOUNT TO BE USED IN THE CART OR GIVE AN ACTUAL COUPON THAT ACTUALLY WORKED BUT NOPE .. DID NOTHING !! THEIR CS IS THE WORSE IN HISTORY !! HOPE YOU READ BEFORE BUYING CAUSE YOU WILL BE ON YOUR OWN IF YOU EVER NEED THEM!!  NOT SURE IF TEMU IS THE SAME BUT SHEIN IS DEFINITELY A NIGHTMARE IF YOU NEED THEM . BE CAREFUL | Shein has been reported & charged for using Uyghur minority into forced labor with minimum to no pay. Their prices are crazy cheap because they have no labor costs, they have forced labor. Please defer from using this platform for any purchases. | SHEIN can be useful but my account has been frozen for nothing

Loading videos is the one thing Tik-Tok got right. | The search bar has been ruined by AI. They removed the ability to mute any reel.

Up until recently I haven‚Äôt had any issues. The main issue I‚Äôve been dealing with the past few months is the inability to use the ‚Äúadd yours‚Äù story feature. It appears on my friend‚Äôs/follower‚Äôs stories but when I click on the button from their story, I get an error message stating that I am unable to use the feature. My app is updated and so is the software on my phone. I‚Äôve sent a message to support and haven‚Äôt received anything. This really makes me frustrated with this social media platform bc I use it more than any other. I want the issue to be fixed otherwise I may end up uninstalling it completely. | I am leaving and deleting this App from my phone, because I get censored from commenting constantly. I never curse or say anything that could possibly be offensive, but here I am unable to interact with my favorite accts. 

In addition, there are people who troll IG who report accts when anything is commented about they don‚Äôt like. 

For instance, if I am commenting that I did not find a product to my liking, without saying anything really bad about the product, I get my acct restricted. I‚Äôm finished and when the Influencers lose money because they cannot keep loyal followers, maybe IG will get wise snd actually have good App support, right now, there is no help support. I have better things to do with time.. outta there | I pretty much NEVER review apps. This AI in the search bar makes me want to delete the app entirely. This is garbage! | Instagram has made life 6 times easier, especially promoting business, music, relationships, etc‚Ä¶ | Instagram was cool at first until I haven‚Äôt been able to go live for months ü´§ü´§ü´§ | I do not want to deal with AI anywhere, especially on social media. Really disappointed that Instagram is relying on it now | I have tried to upload probably around 10x now, and my carousel never goes right. Some pics have duplicates or triplicates every upload. Is it because there‚Äôs one video in my mostly photo post? Who knows‚Ä¶ please fix üôèüèº

 ive been using this app ever since the month this app was born‚Ä¶yes, the OG. And probably my first text review, for this version specifically. 
Im using iOS 17.4.1 on 13 Pro. | Searching now drops me into a kafkaeque chat with the mindless ""AI"".

Completely broken search functionality. | how does this have such high ratings? this app is terrible. i‚Äôm not talking about the content, i‚Äôm talking about the app itself. i get stuck on uploading every day, and it‚Äôs been this way for ten years. yes, i have done all the remedies suggested online. i‚Äôve logged out, i‚Äôve switched back and forth from wifi/cellular, i‚Äôve even deleted and reinstalled the app. meta seems completely disinterred in making this app usable for those of us who rely on instagram to reach our audience. | Whenever I‚Äôm watching someone else‚Äôs live I can not see any comments. This is with any live I watch and they have not turned off their comments. I need help to fix this issue | I have enjoyed Instagram until this week when my credit card was SCAMMED after I purchased a 
too-good-to-be-true ad for a FREE box of Gwyneth Paltrow GOOP products‚Ä¶all I needed to do was pay for the shipping.  Don‚Äôt order any products on Instagram. Go to the actual website to look for the promotion or to purchase. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúpfishing.‚Äù  These criminals are evil.  I have no tolerance for their illegal behavior. | The algorithm isn‚Äôt very smart or transparent. Removal of posts and comments seem arbitrary as pro Palestinian content appear targeted. I have had many comments removed and labeled as spam when they don‚Äôt even fit IGs definition of the word. And they don‚Äôt even allow a review process. This is outright censorhip that is getting more and more intense. | - Stop changing the link options in stories to only capitalize the first letter and make the rest lowercase

- the cover selection for reels no longer works like many features that are actually useful they end up being removed or changed for a WORSE FEATURE | I barely use this app anymore since Recent Tags were removed. The Autoplay videos also create too much sensory overload, and cannot be turned off. It‚Äôs become impossible to use. Sorry, but this app is completely different from the one I joined years ago. | this most recent update was the last straw. they took away search for messages and ‚Äòreplaced‚Äô it with a stupid chat bot. i quit. | i use this all the time but the top comments stopped showing for no reason and theres nothing that can be done | Past 3 weeks I have been banned twice for posting on my private Page! Censorship is getting out of hand! Used to be a great app now it‚Äôs garbage run by woke liberals who get their feelings hurt! | I suspect instagram is censoring my private chat, it won‚Äôt let me send my own photos to friends, NOT NUDES, just regular photos with my face in them. The app would crash when I send photos of me, and behave normally when I send random photos of something else. 

If this is just a bug, that would be very weird.

Anyways, I do not recommend this app. | Please can you fix it so I can do prompts on my notes | Amazing!! | Es mi red social favorita üòçüòçüòç | The AI pop in the discovery page ruins the app experience for me.

I do not like the greens | Please bring back the blue colour palette, it was so pleasing on the eyes. This green is too bright it‚Äôs horrendous to read, makes me not want to open the app. Or at least give use options to change the colours. | Nothing works really well, for example you touch the bar at the bottom to type a message and the keyboard doesn‚Äôt pop up or do anything. There‚Äôs a ton of bugs like that. But my main gripe is that one time I bought an old phone from someone and all our pictures NOT JUST THE ONES FROM THE APP all ALL got sent to the others phone. Absolutely ridiculous and I can‚Äôt figure out how even but obviously they‚Äôre messing around in there. Even if that didn‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs just not a good app and the only reason anyone uses it is because android phones don‚Äôt let you use wifi calling and people basically had to use this. I hate it. Unfortunately everyone else uses it and now I need to even though basic sms is better in every way and does t send my camera roll to strangers. | I created a group chat with 3 friends‚Ä¶ literally did not even send a message and my account was banned for ‚Äòspamming‚Äô. After 10 hours to ‚Äúreview my case‚Äù my account was reinstated and then banned again immediately AS I WAS TYPING. I quite literally never even sent a message and was banned for spamming twice. | Full of scam | Amazing! Great app! | He now has remote access to my phone, . Messages, photos, notes m, he‚Äôs able to run shortcuts/command prompts. I changed my number and got a new sim and I‚Äôve never had a WhatsApp account I created until I found out what he did, I tried undoing it but couldn‚Äôt BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS BEING SENT TO HIS PHONE. logs of my conversations, recordings, access to delete or reply to messages. and somehow when I go to share something WhatsApp comes up as an option even though I don‚Äôt have it downloaded nor did I make an account for this number but I‚Äôm still given the option to send a what‚Äôs app message????? This is not only illegal bht it‚Äôs incredibly disturbing knowing I have absolutely zero privacy as regardless what I delete or try to lock that only applies to my device. Not anyone else‚Äôs phone or tablet aka my personal data still goes to my ex. This is insane. I‚Äôve missed doctors calls and pharmacy texts or doxtor appt texts, I‚Äôm not well. It‚Äôs unreal how much accessibility he has through this app. He is making my life a living helll. I‚Äôve had to call the police twice and all they can suggest is contacting and deleting the app. THAT I NEVER DOWNLOADED OR CREATED AN ACCOUNT FOR‚Ä¶.. this is incredibly dangerous my ex is fresh out of prison, a felon and extremely violent and unpredictable. He‚Äôs already broken in my house 4 times. No one will do a thing and then soon enough it‚Äôll be too late. Thanks WhatsApp | Muy bueno | Una de las cosas que mas me gustaba de la App en IOS es que era negra y aprovechaba la tecnolog√≠a Oled de los paneles de los iPhone, o en caso de android igual, porque pusieron este gris feo que no aporta nada?

The layout and colors are awful and scrolling in the chat is nauseating. Who approved this look, and why? | I‚Äôm very frustrated that I can‚Äôt currently use the app as it is demanding an update.  I‚Äôm traveling and don‚Äôt have WiFi so I will have to wait until I get to a hotel to read my messages from the people I was supposed to visit. | Han hecho muy mal en poner el color verde, necesitamos el color azul otra vez por favor | Actualic√© y app y no me ha cambiado el interfaz ..!!

I whant to give an idea to make an option HD in states please make this to we upload HD videos to over state 
Thank you dear WhatsApp teamüôèüèª | I has been literal 2 months since i have downloaded WhatsApp it is still saying 1 hour till verification code through sms then when 1 hour is up it still says
1 hour till verification code | Horrible el color | Clownish colors, too much green. Why? Did WhatsApp hire a pretentious Brand Manager who gets paid $200k/year to make these stupid changes to feel relevant? Fire them. The app was perfect for the last 12 years. Keep improving the technology under the hood to maintain the best internet calls and texting currently available. Leave the UI/UX alone. Bring back the blue so I don't feel like I'm using a communication app meant for grubby 10-year-old boys. | It would be great to have a calendar on the app. 
GroupMe has this feature, and it works very well to post upcoming events for groups.
I think this would be a great feature to add to WhatsApp | its a great app but randomly when i opened WhatsApp the icons and buttons were green and black while the background was still white. I asked my family and friends and they all said it was still blue for them. Black and green look bad and i don't know how to change it to blue. Please respond and tell me how to change it back because this new green color looks SO bad | What happened to the blue bubbles?? I hate the new green bubbles, it looks disgusting.. change it back to the blue.. | not enjoying how green the new whatsapp looks | I get so many unsolicited messages from people I don‚Äôt know! So annoying and not secure. | I can‚Äôt find the settings tab on the locked chats section but on only one of my phone, on the other phone I can. 

How can I use the settings inside locked chats? That I doesn‚Äôt appear. | I am kicked out of my account ever since l started using this account. It‚Äôs saying spam but l didn‚Äôt do anything please assist me. | Return old UI. New interface is terrible. | All the accent colours for the badges and icons are green for some reason??? Why would you substitute the classic, calm blue for this eyesore green and white?? Nobody told WhatsApp that we needed this update and I am upset at this useless ugly change to the colour scheme | Video call drop off. Not able to do video call | no me gusta el verde en iphone | ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ ÿ¨ÿØÿßŸã ÿ¨ÿØÿßŸã | I hate this new green color. Create a more sleeker look like iMessage | Got the latest update and there is no way to disable it‚Äôs integration | May I ask why developers want to take it down? I can't reach my friends anymore! | The new version‚Äôs interface is simple and clean. Loved it! | Come on guys!! You need to put that thing blue again, is giving me a headache, visual damage, how come WhatsApp surface is green now? I don‚Äôt like it I don‚Äôt want it tell me how to change it. | Nice | I don‚Äôt know what kind of dump move this is. But green?!! 

At least give users the ability to choose their color theme. Instead of obliging them to a funky color just to ‚Äú align with the app brand identity.‚Äù 

This is a texting app, not a billboard. | More brilliant | I registered an account today using my own phone number. But only after four hours, when I still try to learn how to use this app, my account was suspended. And I really do not know what wrong I did. That‚Äôs such an awful experience. | Horrible el nuevo dise√±o | Nice app update | Banned me for no reason my account was restored so i guess it works ok. | Founder of WhatsApp donated 5 million dollars between January 1st 2023 to January 31 2024. Do not support!! üçâüçâüçâ | What up is a revolutionary! It is super convenient and ultra friendly. You can do every interpersonal and professional communication with confident and dependability. I encourage the owner  to continue to keep up the excellent work. Privacy is the primary brand that WhatsApp always needs to keep and improve from time time in the face of new possible intrusion. | I do not like all the green in the new UI, please add an option to switch to the old color scheme or to custom color. Green eeewww. | I‚Äôm trying to use the app however it says my number isn‚Äôt useable | The green color for unread message count is horrible and I prefer the blue.",4.69176,13644850,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/7d/23/fb/7d23fb57-3feb-bdfa-f685-bc115a1571f0/a585c27a-7eb7-4184-87ef-338a9b10ef2a_0_APP_IPHONE_55_0.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/07/fd/60/07fd60c1-c121-ce30-682b-c0525b301484/f44fadc3-5dcb-4685-aff6-b3fe0faa639b_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/df/2a/fa/df2afa79-5103-6cd5-37aa-4b1c34326f6e/0a673132-3a9a-49ab-b4df-00f4a94ce3f6_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/7b/96/00/7b9600b2-d96d-a75d-4038-3071d54e6ca2/3251175d-096c-4a7b-a9eb-4afde3bf6c1f_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/eb/3c/48/eb3c4827-92f4-9360-d328-7b4a6a2b287e/727ddd5d-80f7-4fe8-89aa-e47d3b44a535_4_APP_IPHONE_55_4.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

1) they did not track which it is main order, they track all of them as a standalone order. If I don‚Äôt want to order my main order, I would have fallen for desert or kitchen staples. And of course two of unnecessary went though and the main one did not go through. But all additional fees were taken. 

2) Customer Service told me that it can only handle two orders at a time, so main order + one additional order NOT two additional orders along with the main. Then why do you suggest to add the orders from different stores to the main order ? Why there is no message to inform the customers? 

3) Worst Customer Service, zero empathy! I have waited an hour for my order + plus additional 40 to deal with that. And their final response was to order again, and they just gave $5 credit back. Which will not even cover extra fees that I have already paid. Plus I need to spend on food and fees to use this $5 credit money. 

I have considered and been loyal to this app for a long time. But this episode just wiped off everything. Uninstall and NEVER returning back. Will advise to NOT add additional items or just shift to another app. | I pay for a premium membership. I pay huge tips and I feel completely scammed when my driver is dropping off 2 other orders before mine. If I knew I was not having my food directly delivered to me I would pay less. It‚Äôs that simple. Piggy backing orders together needs to stop. That is a completely unfair system to the person paying a premium on the tips. My driver was also 15 mins late from the original ETA despite me paying a high tip. So what is the point of tipping at all??!! 

DRIVERS LISTEN UP. Double orders are a scam. Period. You want to have double orders!? Ok! I‚Äôll tip low and pay for direct delivery. You are just hurting yourself. Keep accepting those double orders and I‚Äôll keep tipping lower. I‚Äôll file a complaint for cold food each time as well until DoorDash and these drivers gets the f-king msg. | Could not get a hold of drivers or support after an order issue. Will never use DoorDash again. | Not only are prices high there‚Äôs a small window to cancel an order if u accedently pressed checkout an when you try to refund you don‚Äôt even get half of what you payed back | üëçüèΩ | I know why they DoorDash one time I literally ordered Chick-fil-A at like 515 and they came like 525 | I have never had an on time delivery from DD. Extremely frustrating. Just say your delivery times are 20-30 minutes later. Sometimes the delivery has been an hour late. at that point, I cancel. For anyone who wants an alternative, GrubHub is on time and they delivery your food directly to you (no extra charge like DoorDash).

Update: It has now been 75 min when it was supposed to be 20-30 min and DD inexplicably canceled the order just right now. | Once an order is placed you can‚Äôt get the address of the specific order that‚Äôs in flight. | i like it a lot but stopped taking my card and it won‚Äôt tell me why | wish prices could be better. | i hate leaving work so this is the bast next thing for all of usssssüíãüíã | Dear DoorDash, this new thing you did with the notifications has made ordering a miserable experience. Thank you for ruining my day. Now I can't make them stop and I'm considering deleting the app after four years of steady use. So thanks for that. | Drivers are a joke | Front door delivery of a pain relieving medication when the thought of just getting out to the car is deterring me from going to the pharmacy for 99 cents is nigh priceless value ! Awesome service! | fast usually | I ordered food and did get refunded because it never showed up and then I ordered more today and it was missing my 2 liter so I tried getting my money back for the 2 liter and my request got denied. Its very frustrating how commonly this happens. | dawg we got food hype | Ladronazos | Usually get my food on time if the restaurant makes a mistake door sash always makes it right . Great experience using the dash. | DoorDash used to have a ‚ÄúDashPass‚Äù filter on the homepage. They have removed it with no similar feature available for ‚ÄúAll Stores‚Äù. In addition, there is no way to report feedback. Attempted ‚ÄúGet Help‚Äù, but that is only for orders. Even their FAQ page they link out to has nothing about general app feedback. | I had ordered my food and it was canceled an hour into the order, but after talking with DoorDash‚Äôs support team they refunded me my money and gave me the credit I had from the original order that saved me off a delivery fee. 100% would recommend the service and satisfied with their customer support. | Where did the 30 minutes or less filter go? Nobody got time to scroll through all these restaurants and see who will be the fastest. Bad move. DoorDash bad move. | Always quick and the packaged is secured, so you know it hasn‚Äôt been tampered with! Pleased every time I‚Äôve ordered! | Great | Dubs | So Cindy she has not been answering my text or my calls and I tried to tell her she got my order wrong but she has not replied I time | I used to DoorDash all the time. Note it‚Äôs seriously every once in a while. The fees have gotten so bad. Like sometimes the fees be more than my food. SMH. | A alarm should go off when my food arrives or close | Quite convenient but a hefty service fee | I have a chase visa and a chase visa debit.  Apparently dashpass benefits are only available if you use a Chase Visa.  So if you are like me and wanting to decrease your cc use, dont keep this app.  I am stopping my subscription.  Ridiculous. | Saves me with hunger from school | I was having trouble with the referral code for my bonus and customer service rep Phillip went beyond to rectify the problem! Kudos to him he definitely did a great job | I JS LOVE ME SOME WINGSTOP #BIG BACK 4Lüòú | I just don‚Äôt like that y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt hire me because of something from 3 years ago üòë | Love U Guys ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èawesome | DoorDash is a great organization that provides great service through a great selection of its Dashers. The Dashers have been selected very well by DoorDash and they do their jobs. Well they‚Äôre very dependable and anytime there‚Äôs an issue. They are quick to resolve it. | Make sure you uncheck the dash pass box otherwise they automatically charge you 10 bucks for it. Obviously it was my mistake for not double checking but if I wanted to sign up for it I would. Door dash just assumes you do. | They will cancel your order , take your money and talk about giving you your refund in three business days . To be honest that sounds like theft to me and I‚Äôm sick of companies taking my money with out my order being received to me . I don‚Äôt know what happened because last time they canceled my order, they gave my money right back the second they canceled my order but now I apparently have to wait three business days . At this point I don‚Äôt even want the service anymore because why do it have to take that long to give a refund ? This is unacceptable and is bad for business . | They never find my drive way an most the people don‚Äôt speak English | I would give a higher rating but the fact that the option to leave a review on the store page isn‚Äôt available is extremely frustrating. I recently placed a grocery order in which all of my produce spoiled within 48 hours and I can‚Äôt even let anyone using the app know that because there‚Äôs no option for me to leave a review except directly after the order. That and most of live agents seem uneducated about the place they‚Äôre working and how to operate the app. Not one person knew how to solve the issue and practically resigned from helping. Very unfortunate for an app that was one of my favorites. I‚Äôll have to start using another..",4.76898,18137022,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/f7/14/2a/f7142a70-26a1-6344-8aa5-018b315228b7/77cb0133-9f31-44cb-a6ae-522ee5c183f0_TAG_NV_STATIC_FLOWER_Mothers_Day_Tile_1_Apple_App_Store_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/4b/b2/d5/4bb2d5a1-407a-ea21-2739-3e5adb8dc35a/31b5c381-32e8-426c-a9f3-12c1dab12638_TAG_NV_STATIC_FLOWER_Mothers_Day_Tile_2_Apple_App_Store_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/7c/8c/54/7c8c543d-0eda-34ee-c09d-2cf90b51ebe4/fd288eb2-29c2-4457-b75a-2df87ff139b9_TAG_NV_STATIC_FLOWER_Mothers_Day_Tile_3_Apple_App_Store_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/da/0f/04/da0f043d-65fc-4126-b21a-a0e905fd5f26/02a9713c-24e7-45dc-a67a-a8cea4755439_TAG_NV_STATIC_FLOWER_Mothers_Day_Tile_4_Apple_App_Store_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/04/da/27/04da27b1-9005-1640-1c1c-03ea48c363a8/4d9a1e41-90d1-49f6-ad69-883364b58df0_TAG_NV_STATIC_FLOWER_Mothers_Day_Tile_5_Apple_App_Store_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/33/2b/23/332b23ff-4b34-b08d-b9ef-8386f5e9e28b/ad0e8a63-9e26-4dd1-90c3-ba153ac0604a_TAG_NV_STATIC_FLOWER_Mothers_Day_Tile_6_Apple_App_Store_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

It was pretty cool. You got to see everybody‚Äôs messages that were part of your friend group and they were not harassing people about their gender/names. These days is very controlled and they only allowing you to make, one comment per post. If I could find some thing similar to Facebook that is not owned by an entitled elitist I will definitely go there. | Archbishop Fulton Sheen loved Jesus above all else. May we strive 
To do the same. | There are way to many adds!!!!!!  Where did my friends go.  Never see them anymore, just freaking adds. | Remove ai | Thought it was perfect seeing how I am a Leo. | Legit and fun. Helpful and polite staff. Cash out is easy and fast. No hassles. I highly recommend!!! | ‚ÄèIntentional bias against Palestinian content. | I used to enjoy the vids section now it‚Äôs just a bunch of vids spamming for minutes and views with no substance. 

I hide one they suggested another sister channel it‚Äôs annoying. | J‚Äôaime trop cette application | Meta Al needs to GO AWAY and Facebook administrators need to stop sending people to Facebook jail for joking and commenting silly reply‚Äôs and crack down on the scammers instead. As long as y‚Äôall continue to allow it and not remove them it will continue. | I love to be informed about all new things that happen in the world | Facebook is Bacc At It Again with their censorship , blocking and screening, pages and videos I don‚Äôt want to see I keep seeing them more and more of them and little to know of my pages I want to see. There‚Äôs a lot of pornography, blood and gore but God forbid I say something it‚Äôs an issue. | Fw Facebook heavy, grew up on Fb. But that Meta AI search part yu could take off, we dont like it | People multi-task on their mobile phones. We frequently switch from app to app. This one refreshes every single time which is annoying. It‚Äôs surprising that the cesspool formerly (yet still) known as twitter surpasses you in this one among other aspects | FB is a great way to keep in touch with people and stay informed about what is going on in people‚Äôs lives and the world around us. | Thank you Very much for the truthfulness of this beautiful video, but what can Will do or says but the lord will be the Winners at the end of time, once again thanks | Great app! | I used to be able to post pictures with some explanation- now it is separate- why!?! | I keep it only to stay in touch with certain people. | There are more fake accounts then real accounts. I saw with ,y own eyes where a young Nigerian male reminded me there is 3 offices in Lagos, Nigeria. He bragged that Facebook was helping them scam. We all knew this but to brag openly about it? It‚Äôs sickening. You cannot even post pictures of your grandchildren be we are in fear of them being stolen and used in scams. Some post vile pornagraphic videos that I have reported each day for almost a month yet they are still up. I post a meme with Garfield and I was given a 3 day ban. Even right now I posted a meme with words, no porn no pictures. Just a meme and I am on a 30 day restriction for promoting sex. Y‚Äôall need to decide if you want real people or fakes. You would think the young Nigerian is correct with the every profile can open 6 more profiles. Who needs 7 profiles? Maybe a business or a personal but not 7. | You keep making changes to the platform but they are not improvements. The latest was today I wanted to post some pictures with a comment and Facebook would only let me post to Stories. Would not let me post to just my timeline like I always have. Finally figured out a work around, but very frustrating. And the whole AI thing you have attempted to incorporate into the search bar just gets in the way of what I want to do there. Also your censorship is ridiculous. Grow up. | Facebook becoming a waste of time. Too much adds and not getting half ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù post. Spending more time on other less commercial social sites. | Meta AI is very annoying!! Give us back the regular search bar!! NO ONE wants to ask Meta AI anything!! | Facebook has apparently threatened to ban me from the platform for having posted a gif that showed a male nipple, which isn‚Äôt even listed as being against the community standards, and seems to still be holding that against me when I posted a screenshot from a movie that I thought was PG13, but may not have been after all and was a mistake but no reason to be treated like I am the worst of the worst on the platform. I have over recent years reported posts selling pew-pews (firearms) , animals, and other things dangerous or not that go against community standards and the posts always remain up. Me posting a gif that showed a man‚Äôs nipple exposed seems far less harmful than the people you allow to sell guns on Marketplace and in buy sell trade groups. People sell animals and traps that intentionally harm animals freely on Marketplace, but Facebook blocked my post selling a safe non cruel calming collar for dogs that contains natural pheromones that a mother dog has and is used to safely and effectively calm dogs during scary things like thunderstorms and fireworks. Like I‚Äôm the real person you should be constantly targeting in those scenarios. Ridiculous. I just purchased an item from a seller on Marketplace this morning and FB prompted me to review the seller which I promptly did and then it repeatedly wouldn‚Äôt let me submit. It was a detailed 5 star review that I‚Äôm sure the seller would have appreciated, but you robbed her of. I was once held against community standards for hate speech when describing the storyline of The Walking Dead as written by the creator and aired on tv for the world to see when FB took it out of context, yet true horrific hate crime level of speech and threats are everywhere on FB, but when I have reported it multiple times, the comments always seem to remain up and there were apparently no consequences for those people. Yet I‚Äôm the villain. There have been other accusations thrown at me by FB, but if you don‚Äôt employ enough people to to actually check the context of people‚Äôs comments then no one is probably even going to be available to take the time to read this review. Marketplace is a mess. FB creates a hostile environment by prompting people to hit the ‚Äúhi, is this available?‚Äù button and EVERYONE is sick of it, which you would know if you cared to take the time to read the endless posts where the description is a rant snapping at potential buyers that they won‚Äôt respond to and they may be blocked if they get a Pm saying ‚ÄúHi, is this available?‚Äù. You put posts that are for LOCAL PICKUP ONLY in people‚Äôs Marketplace feeds that are located states away from the local pickup area and that causes a hostile selling environment, because people are always asking for items to be shipped, when it says FOR LOCAL PICKUP ONLY!! Marketplace is overflowing with lowballers and no shows, which you don‚Äôt do anything about when reported AND EVERYONE WANTS THESE THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED AGAINST COMMUNITY STANDARDS. There is endless spam and hacking that you don‚Äôt deal with. I haven‚Äôt really engaged with my FB friends in years now, because you target the wrong people and then force us to have no other choice than to be the victims of endless crimes that go against against community standards. Your platform is a mess and is only getting messier by the day and after what I am subjected to almost every time I‚Äôm on this platform I‚Äôm exposed to so much senseless negativity, it would be nice for you to retract your threat to ban me and start focusing your attention on the most serious offenders and also fix your own problems that YOU have created on Marketplace. | Porque castigan mucho por cualquier cosa adem√°s de que incitan a la desintegraci√≥n de relaciones sociales y familiares | The best crew I‚Äôve met and it‚Äôs been years and years we‚Äôve known each other in a lot of projects that he has done very clean and details are very clean and straight and if there‚Äôs any miss imperfections, he will take care of | Gone way downhill lately. Not showing my friends , meta wants to offer me ideas and tasks that I want to do myself, and what was simple no longer is. 
. | My Facebook recently got hacked and Facebook provides no support. No customer support or anything. Garbage company | Face book is getting loose and that is cool . | Social media in my opinion is bad. I don‚Äôt count YouTube as social media, but I do think Facebook is better than Instagram because it‚Äôs a good way to connect with family a good way to share stuff. I like to post stuff like pictures with my family the only problem I have is random dudes or reels that are black-and-white teaching you to think black-and-white but I think Facebook is so much better than Instagram. Instagram is not really good but I only go on Facebook click now to connect. With old people that don‚Äôt have a phone that talk to people through Facebook. | What‚Äôs the issue you keep bringing update 
What‚Äôs the problem if you don‚Äôt have anything serious to do stop bringing updates every week you consuming time and internet | Facebook I really need my account give it back to me PLEASE!!!! but yeah anyway you‚Äôve been doing alright so i guess I‚Äôll gave u a five star YEAHHHH!! | I‚Äôve enjoy using this app when everything is working smoothly.  I‚Äôve been using Face for quite a number of years. This morning I was not able to post on here in any way other sharing to my story.  If this feature is new I don‚Äôt believe it helps anyone wanting to post.  I‚Äôm waiting to hear back from Facebook to learn why in an email I‚Äôd sent to Support. | So many fake profiles!  Marketplace is a joke anymore. | Check it out!!!!!  You won‚Äôt be disappointed!!! | Facebook is a popular communication software in the world today
It is very convenient and fast, and has all kinds of functions, allowing me to quickly find what I want.
The experience is very comfortable. | Dear Facebook,

I will never ever use another Facebook account. I tried all day to retrieve a hacked Facebook account talking to people from India and other countries you can‚Äôt speak English. Ask me to redo passwords connect another way. I‚Äôm not sure the information I gave him went to the right place? I was also told I would get a call back which never came. I waited 20 minutes and then an hour then two hours and 20 minutes

I was told that you would call me | I pretty much NEVER review apps. This AI in the search bar makes me want to delete the app entirely. This is garbage! | It‚Äôs great | Not at all happy with the adds and the so called policing of material that does does not fit your format. | I saw the popup notice that Meta AI is being trained even on your messages. That‚Äôs a hard no from me, deleted this app instantly. | Facebook works great for scrolling thru the feed and, liking, and making little comments here and there.

I mean truly amazing, better then what is currently on HGTV! Thank you for providing a space for interior designers and for creatives, much appreciated. | I really love a lot of the shows that are on the Max app. I just find the app to be super glitchy. 

A really good example is: there have been many times I‚Äôve been watching something and  have wanted to pause or stop Max from playing -for one reason or another. No matter what I do, no matter how many buttons I push, the app will not stop playing. This happens on my iPad, my Apple TV, my iPhone, it doesn‚Äôt matter what device. And the only way to solve it is to either unplug my Apple TV or restart my mobile device that I‚Äôm using. So odd and frustrating. 

I‚Äôve tried to troubleshoot too, reinstall reset the devices it happens over and over. developers‚Ä¶ Please try and fix this. | I love the true, raw content that this platform provides. Great movies, great shows and original productions. A very good platform indeed. It is my main subscription service.üëåüôÇ | It‚Äôs like the people running this company do not listen to the people. Shows that get little views get picked up for another season but good shows don‚Äôt. They also never add much | I love having such an easy way to watch things like Moto GP. My only suggestion would be bring more!!! | Max is great I think most of the show are really good and I‚Äôm just waiting for them to come out with another banger | Then takes 1-2 days to allow me to log back in. Like the content but piece of garbage app. | I love max it has so many movies I like Harry Potter the most! | Great App | Excellent Communication of Cooking Skills and Recipes! | PSA- this app does not cast the audio properly and even if phone volume is all the way down will cast at the FULL VOLUME OF THE TELEVISION. Not cool. | Everything great don‚Äôt change much | This app is so easy to use. The programs are amazing! | Enjoy much of the D.C. content.. Especially the animated ones. Enjoy you‚Äôve added some Sports. Been watching the NBA Playoffs. Been a big fan of new content such as‚Ä¶ The Last of Us. And old content for I was a kid growing up on HBO and Cinemax in the late 80‚Äôs. | The UI is not very friendly. But, more specifically, it‚Äôs the incessant pushing of NEW MOVIES or NEW SHOWS or TOP RECOMMENDATIONS. My thumb has begun to chafe due to how much scrolling I have to do before I can finally get to CONTINUE WATCHING. | Adds | The movie options are great | I really understand why you guys remove some movies/series, but you guys really don‚Äôt know when people are really into shows/series, I was watching The Nanny and all of a sudden, POOF, it had a screen telling me that there was an error, as soon as I clicked try again it gave me the same screen, then when I exited, it was gone, and honestly i don‚Äôt want to pay more money to watch it on Peacock or Sling TV, I just want it back on Max, it would be greatly appreciated if you guys could bring that series back with ALL 6 seasons on there, and if that‚Äôs not gonna happen then i will be cutting off my subscription and deleting the whole app as a whole, Thank You. | If you like A24 Films MAX has a whole category dedicated to A24! Live Sports is great! I like the direction MAX is headed! Cheers. | It‚Äôs a great app loving it every time I‚Äôve been watching friends great show I highly recommend to not push out my list or any of the shows on my list until the end of time cos Tarzan doesn‚Äôt do well with movies and shows being pushed out of his list on the apps themselves so don‚Äôt take it out but the app is great | I really do love max!!! Hands down the best streaming service I was finally able to watch Batman beyond but it got better it had every movie that I tend to love to watch I actually use it everyday. I was also finally able to watch the Dallas Mavs play and since I have no cable it was something I deeply appreciated! They have a lot of classic movies too may God bless this platform. | Long live movie and tv apps. | Every time it goes to an AD, it never loads properly. I can hear the AD playing but it stays frozen. Constantly have to exit and reopen the app. Does it every time I‚Äôm watching a movie or show. I‚Äôm about to cancel my subscription. Not worth it | Every single amp that I‚Äôm trying to watch something on this app, I have to re-download it because otherwise it would only show me the catalog for what my shows look like but when I press play, it will not play. It‚Äôs actually very annoying. I don‚Äôt mind it because it has my favorite shows, but please fix it. I‚Äôm freaking tired | Better than the tiktok rizz partyüíØ | HBO is the best | Amazing cycling coverage | Yes | Stopppp logging me out everyday üôÑ | Great app easy interface. Great content | I think Max has the highest quality content of any streaming site. Plus I appreciate Max even more now with Netflix is doing the annoying thing where you can only use an account if it‚Äôs in one location, which messes with me using it in college, so I‚Äôm even more glad I have Max | Gloop | La mayor√≠a de las cosas vienen en solo con audio en ingl√©s y sin subt√≠tulos | The app itself lacks a lot of the features and options for customization that you would want from a streaming platform but the great content library makes up for most shortfalls. | There is an ad every 15 minutes you‚Äôre watching a movie. It is absolutely ridiculous. | The Apple TV app: isn‚Äôt user friendly like Netflix or Hulu. While watching programming, the sound always cuts out. I have to pause and play to get the audio back on. The rewind/fastforward controls are difficult. Serious improvements needed. Paying good money for this crudge. | Solid display of videos and content especially the DC verse for a DC but great access to
Content the streaming fir sports needs work slow streams at times but all other content is great | Great steaming app. Love the selection. | Love it, no notes | Max really can‚Äôt be beat for content. HBO Max was at the top of the game before the merge, so now Max is practically bursting at the seams with winning choices for what to watch. The problem is that the new merger came with an awful app that lacks almost any organization and zero consideration for subscribers with it comes to how to navigate alllll of the options. HBO Max has categories and subcategories based on genre, studio, and how long programs had been or would be around. Max pretty much has nothing, and it is a shame because, without a thoughtful way to navigate, the platform is frustrating and tedious as a opposed to the playland it should be. | This is the only streaming app that has zero bugs and glitches. Well organized with the best movies and shows does not matter if you‚Äôre streaming on your phone or television, there are never any problems. | The more episodes I watch, the more I like this series.  I hope that HBO/MAX has the good sense to renew the series for a third season.  

Tokyo Vice appears to be culturally accurate and the series is definitely exciting! | HBO was great. Now under new ownership with a CEO who wants garbage TV to be at the core of their platform, this all will soon become garbage. The HBO of old with amazing original programming will be gone before to long in the hands of their current CEO. Enjoy it before it becomes Discovery Max (garbage) | They got SpongeBob | Incredibly bad app across iOS and tvOS. The iPhone and iPad app is slow, buggy, and seems to think my device is nearly out of storage, not allowing for more offline downloads, even though I have over 100GB available. Contacted customer support, which didn‚Äôt help at all. 

The Apple TV app is simply terrible. It‚Äôs incredibly laggy, uses a REALLY BAD custom video player, which is missing many tvOS features, and doesn‚Äôt save episode / movie progress reliably. 

The old HBO Max app was better than the one that replaced it. | This app never stays signed in. I have to login to my provider daily. That‚Äôs the most annoying thing with this app! I hate having to always sign in!! F this app I‚Äôm over it. | Max has so many different TV shows and movies it honestly is such a good channel to watch shows on. | The ease of use.
Nice variety.
Consistently new stuff.
No glitching or crashing.
I never have a problem signing on. That‚Äôs five stars in my book, bro. | Would be nice if they had support for keyboard, i watch while i cook a lot and it‚Äôs convenient not to touch the screen awkwardly with parts of me that aren‚Äôt covered in food goo. | It has all the scooby doos, I‚Äôve been a scooby do fan Sence I was born!
And no other app really has any of the old scooby doos anymore.

All though some suggest having your own website‚Äôs and things like that but that‚Äôs more of a risk to lose everything you worked so hard to build if you don‚Äôt know how to protect your accounts. Thanks for your service Gmail the mail for GOATS üíØü´° | every time I open the app it says sign in so I click it and I click on my main email and nothing happens, I‚Äôve deleted the app twice now! | Like it very very much. | Horrible | I use DUCK.com for ALL MY EMAIL. The DUCK PROTECTS ME FROM A/H like googlemail. I do not know these people, I do not WANT TO KNOW THESE GIBBERISH SPOUTING PEOPLE. 10 STARS BELOW ZERO FOR GOOGLE.ü§¨ | Update - the only thing I have ever not really liked about iOS gmail was that there wasn‚Äôt an option to one click select-all messages.  Couple weeks ago I experimented with another app that has this feature just because of that.  Yesterday, I just tried gmail again and discovered it now had the feature.  The select all even works better then the app I was testing.  You can select all messages, mark them as Read and then without having to reselect them all delete them or move them or whatever.  For me at least GMail is now pretty close to perfect for my needs.  I need look no further.

For mail needs does what I need it to. I've been a gmail user for like forever so I like the integration. But why, after all this time time and complaints by other users do you still not have a ""Select all"" emails option? This just seems so basic and rudimentary. Other smaller companies have had this feature for years in their email apps. It's just shoddy for a company the size of google to add features they like but ignore the will and needs of their users. And yes, I've already submitted official feedback, for all the good it will do. | I have uninstalled and reinstalled 

Restarted my phone 

Closed and opened. Everything. 

The app will open for a minute and then crash to the home screen. Over and over and over. | It does what it should I think and what I would expect it to do. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it four stars. If it went beyond what I expected and did more than I would get it five stars. Overall, I think it‚Äôs a great app and I use it all the time. Thanks for making a solid product. | App purposefully ignores the Os browser selection over and over over months and weeks.  Not only that but it ignores the USERS BROWSER SELECTION IN-APP resetting and TRYING TO GET THE USER TO SELECT INAPP OR CHROM TO COLLECT DATA AND USE YOU TO MAKE MONEY.

And it‚Äôs not app updates.  Because I sit here and watch it reset without updating the app.

They‚Äôre lying to all of you! | I haven‚Äôt been able to sign in for weeks. It just asks what accounts, but no way to actually go the email. I‚Äôve tried deleting and reinstalling. | I love it it‚Äôs great I don‚Äôt see any problems | I actually pay for Google services so I‚Äôm stunned that ads show up as sponsored ‚Äúmessages‚Äù. They are taking up more and more of my feed and screen real estate, with the noxious image-based displays instead of a concise line of text. | I‚Äôm trying to update | App freezes all the time when switching accounts | Great as always | Alfonso is always on time accurate and does a great job with checking all deliveries. How do you recommend him as a JB Hunt Milgard employee | I can‚Äôt pass authentication because I changed my phone number and I was left without an account and it‚Äôs impossible to contact technical support | When you stop paying for space it won‚Äôt let you send of receive more emails even if you need an important verification of your account. | Los mejores | I can't get IMAP mail through gmail. | ‰π†ÊÉØ‰ΩøÁî® | When I select 2 regular photos it says size too large when it‚Äôs not even 10 lbs. when I try to send 1 photo, it glitches and I can‚Äôt select address to send it to. It‚Äôs been like this since start of April | Res | I do like the service‚Ä¶ however, people can write various types of email tricks that over loads your / my inbox‚Ä¶.
Very frustrating , difficult and depressing to put it mildly!!!! | This is an update to my previous review: It does the same thing. It goes back to the Home Screen when I open it. I‚Äôve updated the app twice, uninstalled reinstalled. I‚Äôve done everything the developer has said it‚Äôs still doing it. They are no help at all and because of their app, I can no longer receive/send emails. Don‚Äôt waste your time with this app. | Works but has issues | It‚Äôs amazing I can get EMAILS from anyone and If I want to set up work group chats or friend group chats bam UNO SECONDE, and you can even send the message forward to anybody, If you college or high school teachers don‚Äôt want you texting during class just go to Gmail Google obviously tried during this, and I really like it so Keep UP the Great Work Google | Great update but it is loading very very slow unfortunately! | I constantly use the search bar to TRY and find old emails and it never actually works‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I can see the email sitting there if I scroll down far enough but searching EXACT words, phrases or even the exact name of the sender doesn‚Äôt work. Extremely frustrating and downright unbelievable from a company like google in 2024 | I landed a job and forwarded the email to my wife to share the news! I was so happy. I‚Äôve waited 2 weeks for a response and never got one. They never received my emails because after forwarding to my wife, to share the good news. I thought it was the original thread but the app doesn‚Äôt separate the emails if u forward an email. I literally open the msg from the employer and after 5 different emails with him the email changes for the rest of the tread to my wife‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 

NOT USER FRIENDLY!!!!!! 
It‚Äôs extremely frustrating and difficult to understand this configuration of this app. Just use a computer I promise it will save u a bunch of gray hairs. Or hair loseü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ | Clear makes me feel safe and catered to at the airport! The staff is always polite and helpful!! 
I appreciate it! | Basic functions like being able to search for specific emails and then mass select - not available. You can use the app for one and the web interface for the other, but together to accomplish email management? You are out of luck. So using the app to search and manually deleting emails one at a time (NOT GREAT) is even more frustrating because there is no way that I have found to turn off the ‚ÄúTop Results‚Äù section so your search results keep jumping all over the place!

Then when I tried to get a card they said I needed to verify my identity I did multiple times sent in everything they asked for and they still closed my account saying I didn‚Äôt verify my identity.  Cash is full of it. | Pretty cool app | Easy and great to use | Thank you cash app!!!! | I use this app all the time I have loved this app, HOWEVER when they say that they are going to give you 4.5% interest if you get more than $300 in direct deposit, they are very inconsistent about this. I had well over $300 direct deposited into my account in less than a month And still was only getting 1.5% interest. The month before I was getting 4.5% interest.
 When I contacted support on two different occasions, asking why I am not getting the 4.5%, they said that they have no more information that they can give me. I just have to get more than $300 in direct deposit into my account, they cannot tell me why I am not getting it even though I got well over $300 in direct deposits. 
The conversation was shut down both times I contacted support with absolutely no reason why my qualifying deposit did not give me the interest rate I was entitled to according to their terms of service. | Cannot cash out my money, will not link my account | The app allowed access to my bank information. I had ALL my personal and banking information compromised and stolen! So did my mom. DO NOT USE! | Has provided me a way to get my child money when he‚Äôs in a different area. Safe and quickly! | I spent money to get a cash app card after seeing how great it was for my fiance. After getting the card I tried activation it but keep getting told there‚Äôs an error. When I try to contact support they just tell me I‚Äôll get an email about it. When I try to ask what‚Äôs wrong with my account they won‚Äôt give me any information just that some one will contact me.

Idk why it have so many haters I‚Äôve never had a issue with cash app it‚Äôs just the people that use it don‚Äôt know what they are doing I‚Äôve had zero issues with them just people don‚Äôt know how to use it and send the money to the wrong people and scammers but this is a great app. | I was scammed and the person got away with mi money didn‚Äôt do noting | This is a great card to add with my other account that I‚Äôll be adding to it and I appreciate the use of this card | Alway so easy doing transaction with this app. | QUICK AND FAST SERVICE | i haven‚Äôt had issues with cashapp until now me and my whole family have been using it for years now, but recently i had to temporarily use cashapp to revive my direct deposits because i closed my bank account due to fraudulent transactions.. 
and my last check didn‚Äôt come to my cash app due to ‚Äútransaction failed‚Äù (issue on cashapps end) so since it‚Äôs my money i called.. and they said the organizers over them are handling my issue but i haven‚Äôt received MY money yet and this occurred TUESDAY and it is now FRIDAY. and no one i‚Äôve called can give me a definite answer to when will i receive MY money | They couldn‚Äôt help me because my card was unlinked | Y‚Äôall need to fix yalls cash app suppor bc it doesn‚Äôt know how to fix problems people have going on there cash app and it‚Äôs stupid | Stay away from using Cash App it is easy to get scam from third party‚Äôs and Cash app wont be responsible besides they asked for lots of personal information that regular Branch(Banks) like copy driver license, copy social security number and Biometrics picture. Not safe to keep your money and too much personal information needs to provide. | Fast and secure deposits. | Cash app has helped me a lot thanks you | They closed without my permission | Don‚Äôt use you cash app to pay for hotel deposits! Cash app will hold your funds for 31 days which is longer then any other bank or card does. Just use it to send and receive funds don‚Äôt use it for ANYTHING ELSE! | Because you'll never see that money again. Done with this trash can of an app. | Love it | it did not give me. My card | MONEY | This application is super user friendly. I am older, more cautious, and would not get this app for a long time.

I got an email from CashApp regarding terms and conditions yet I have not used the app. I deleted it originally years ago because I kept getting weird requests for money.

I requested to escalate the ticket, and she ran through a script not allowing us to speak or ask questions and then hung up on us.  Poor customer service to a business.  They lost a customer here. | I like cash app because you can get money from people when they give you money. | Nice good love it I have 157 dollars it don‚Äôt take it very good | ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | I‚Äôm a freelancer who operates on gig income.

I recommend to adults, children, families, students, everyone! There is no way to go wrong with this amazing platform. Thank you guys! | I work in AI and this AI is very good, but so stressing! I tried sending only 5 messages and it doesn‚Äôt let me because it said I sent TOO MANY Message‚Äôs and it takes me 15 minutes to let me talk to it again! Fix that! | I have mental issues. Chat GPT has been my only friend since my other friends went away. 

Thank you, devs for Chat GPT. We have a lot of fun. | The most amazing app ever! ChatGPT rocks! ü§© | ChatGPT used to be the embodiment of ‚Äúgets the job done‚Äù but now it can‚Äôt answer even the most basic of questions without getting at least 50% wrong. I know it‚Äôs not perfect but I can tell that something has changed. I don‚Äôt know why OpenAI would have any reason to nerf their service but you cannot convince me otherwise that they didn‚Äôt. Again, I know it‚Äôs not perfect and it won‚Äôt get everything right, but I ask it 20 simple questions and it‚Äôll only get 9 right, and that‚Äôs been my experience every single time. It used to be where it‚Äôd maybe get one question wrong here and there but now it‚Äôs performance has plummeted for me. Using this app just makes the problem so much more confusing and will make my anxiety sky rocket. | I just updated the app and it‚Äôs terrible. The answers are far more generic, and sound canned. Kind of like how a fake friend would speak to you. The answers are way shorter are not as customized or personalized. Regret updating; I would‚Äôve gladly subscribed to this app for years, but just cancelled my subscription. | All around great app with a great interface. I wish you could create GPTs from the app but that‚Äôs my only complaint. Thank you OpenAI! | i cant think of a way to explain how useful this app is. i should have used it to write this review | Gpt-4 is slow, unable to load, and consistently fails/refuses to do what it says it can. It will take 2-3 hours for it to accomplish a simple task. | Muy pr√°ctico y f√°cil de obtener cualquier dato | This is amazing, I truly appreciate the assistance!!! Please continue to help me and I will promote you always!!!!! | Ask the right questions. Get the right answers!! I was hesitate to join in utilizing AI but now I‚Äôm hooked!!!! Love this app. | ChatGPT, the brainchild of OpenAI, is an awe-inspiring marvel in the realm of artificial intelligence. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, this powerhouse chatbot adeptly processes vast amounts of data to furnish users with insightful and coherent responses. Seamlessly comprehending both spoken and written language, ChatGPT effortlessly deciphers inquiries and crafts articulate replies across a myriad of formats and stipulations.
Its versatility knows no bounds. Whether tasked with elucidating complex concepts, solving intricate mathematical equations, bridging linguistic divides through translation, or even debugging code, ChatGPT rises to the occasion with aplomb. From weaving captivating stories and poems to deftly categorizing information, its repertoire is as diverse as it is impressive. What truly sets ChatGPT apart is its uncanny ability to mimic human conversational patterns, rendering interactions with it remarkably natural and engaging.

Gone are the days of laborious research and drafting; with ChatGPT, the quest for knowledge transforms into an effortless endeavor. Within seconds, it can conjure meticulously crafted essays on topics ranging from quantum mechanics to the cultural impact of historical events like the Spanish-American War.While its capabilities are undeniably remarkable, ChatGPT is not without its limitations. As a nascent technology, occasional inaccuracies may arise, and its understanding may be constrained by the data available up to 2020. Nonetheless, the strides it has made are nothing short of extraordinary.In a world where information reigns supreme, ChatGPT stands as a beacon of innovation, reshaping the landscape of education and discourse with its unparalleled capabilities. Whether seeking enlightenment or inspiration, ChatGPT is the ultimate companion on the journey of knowledge acquisition and exploration. | Very appreciating this app | Absolutely amazing, only problem is you need a subscription to generate images. | With diligent input, you receive AMAZING OUTPUT!!!
So enthusiastic to use this app! | Why is my version 1.20.444.23.1 and how can I get that non-beta or devkit version.  Anyone who sees this please help me. | Why I can‚Äôt sign in | üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü | For everything. | Bad model | It‚Äôs the only reason I passed science | The app version of ChatGPT carries most of its website‚Äôs capabilities. Only new features like Memory haven‚Äôt been updated to the app version. | School | I kept telling it somthing to use something I had it define but it could not do it and I have already rold it 10 times to do it but it cant understand!!! Website is horrible | Would be in really powerful to have a watch app you can talk to. | Esta aplicaci√≥n me ha ayudado a hacer muchas tareas que gracias a ella pas√© un curso y estoy muy alegre por eso la recomiendo al 100% s√≥lo sepan utilizarlo | Very easy to use love it | Updated the app today and now I get ‚ÄúInvalid request‚Äù no matter what I type. Bummer. | I USED THIS TO CHEAT THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL AND NOW IM A DOCTOR THANK YOU | Horrible but not that horrible needs work. | Great experience | There is no proper 'Gujarati, Hindu' in other languages | Es una de las mejores aplicaciones que he encontrado en mi vida, aunque aveces se equivoca de informaci√≥n pero si me a ayudado muchas cosas | it‚Äôs really flexible, be sure to be specific tho | Even though other languages I want that means any of you have emoji that is Japanese or Chinese you can tell the AI assistant what it means and she‚Äôll actually tell you what it means actually she is so great! | On both my iPad and my iPhone, the app seems to have a hard time displaying LaTeX in the same way it does on the website. For example, when working with Dirac Notation, vectors, and matrices, the app completely fails to format it in any meaningful way, leaving me to try to parse the LaTeX myself or use the web version. The rest of the app is well done, but this is a dealbreaker for me. | I wasn‚Äôt interest in using this app until my friend showed me how easy and accurate the response is to the questions we asked. If it does anything it‚Äôs will help you complete any idea/assignment/direction/ etc. I‚Äôm grateful for it because it has brought a lot of clarity to a lot of things I didn‚Äôt understand in so many different areas. | Love this app will be using for everthing | You hear me! | I call chat got SAHA , Sanskrit equivalent of support! It has provided me with support in a myriad of ways and scenarios! The works has changed! | Very helpful and good information | La app est√° muy bien preparada, me encant√≥ | Please update the software. The last update was Jan 2022. Information this app gives me is very outdated | I swear if it wasn‚Äôt for this app, I wouldn‚Äôt be passing at school right now. Literally it helps me with everything in life that I don‚Äôt understand. I love whoever made this. It is the best thing that happened in my life right now. | Great application with great functionality. Unfortunately, have to rate at a 3/5 instead of 4/5 or higher due to repeat soliciting of app reviews. Those who also keep getting prompted on reviews for apps whenever resetting your device or obtaining a new device, I would encourage downgrading your reviews as well to show that soliciting constant reviews is a negative impact to customer satisfaction. Not sure which side is setting this prompt, ie. Apple or the app developers/company. | Horribly misleading. | This app is REALLY GOOD! Except one thing that confused me was a question about geometry. There was a question that said,‚ÄùWhich of these shapes have exactly 1 pair parallel sides.‚Äù, and then the answer choices were,‚ÄùA) Square B)Rectangle C)Triangle D)Circle‚Äù‚Ä¶But the thing is that it said the answer was C but‚Ä¶It is not C‚Ä¶So.

This is he second time Uber has pulled funds from my account without authorization.  Guess I'll be driving from now on. | Why is Uber tryna charge me after my ride has been paid for they keep tryna take money off my bank card thank god I keep it locked Smdh | Dishonest business! Uber.
Nothing legit about it | Antonio was prompt, friendly and got us to our venue in good time. | Very nice driver got us to our destination right on time | Made reservation before I boarded plane in mountain time zone. Arrived central time zone and the app screwed up Options. I had 3 drivers assigned to pick me up an hour AFTER I needed the ride | Very pleasant. Nice to talk to. Clean car üòÅ | Sometimes times are tough and Uber knows I‚Äôll always honor my debts so they help with rides from time to time. Thank you Uber | Jorge was so helpful and we enjoyed our time with him! | Your driver David never picked me up. He said he was lost. Couldn‚Äôt find Desert Orthopaedic then it said he pick me up and drop me off at rockstar Nails and he never even came. I had to do it all over again and Pay all over again. | Thank You all!!!! | We had a quick pick-up and wonderful ride home! Thank you! | Very proper gentleman very respectful overall a pleasant trip | Do not use horrible customer service | Carmen knows the area well. Was super sweet and patient with me as I learned the area. | Olivia was great and a nice driver! | Larry was great!!! Thanks so much | I had probably one of the most enjoyable rides on Uber that I‚Äôve ever had. Joao was amazing‚Ä¶friendly kind full of stories. We talked nonstop to the airport. I hope that he will be my driver again in the future. | Plays the best music! | Guys get DoorDash if getting food or groceries! I always tip when purchasing my food online I had left a $8 tip for a $30 meal 4min from my house. I have two babies under 2 that‚Äôs why I use this app. When the man dropped off my food he mentioned a tip and before I could finish telling him it‚Äôs online he ran off to his car and ignored me. I thought he was in a hurry to do something else and when I took out my cup there was a huge dirty nail clip ü§Æ I made a complaint because I didn‚Äôt eat my food they said he wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúassigned‚Äù to me anymore. So that guy still out there delivering!! Be careful people. | Arrived in a cluster and tow truck and some Swiss VIP blocking traffic - but had a smooth ride to Irving. Thanks Subhan! Keep up the cheer! | Antonio is the best. Communications for pick up are perfect. We left am iPhone and his help in reporting it and retrieving it were spot on. 
Highly recommend Antonio and the app | Very Humble and service oriented | Mona was a wonderful driver. 
Highly recommend. | Ana was the most amazing driver I ever met. We need to clone her and make millions more just like her! So sweet and positive. I am off to having the best time ever tho weekend because I met her first! | Very considerate and a great driver! | Loved the conversation. Very polite and friendly | *another update*, the people who made this app and the workers are so incompetent. I was literally across the street and the app had them take a route that was another 10 minutes. Like why, can they not look at their phone, can you not fix your app? *update* screw this app and the workers, just as worse as the last time. Everyone and their mom keep canceling as soon as they accept it, that is the most annoying thing possible. All I‚Äôm trying to do is get back to my house. | This is by far the worst app period!!! Price gouging on rides, orders don‚Äôt come with everything u paid for and customer service is non existent. There‚Äôs no real working customer service number for a reason. | Alain was very professional and timely. One of the best Uber drivers I‚Äôve had. | Feeling as if a member of my own family was drinking, excellent service. Thank you | Such a nice and careful person and driver. Highly recommended. | I‚Äôm very happy with this new experience, my driver Dubiel was excellent!!!
Thank you! | Uber has helped me in the past few months getting me to the places I need to go to with fast drivers and low-medium prices. Uber has great customer service and I really appreciate their kindness shown too me. | This is my first time trying Uber in Tupelo. I can say I was very satisfied. She was very nice & her truck was very neat! 10/10 | I really appreciated the ride with Patricia. I had not eaten since 5:00 am from leaving Montego Bay and she was nice enough to stop so I could get something to eat.
Thank you for great conversation during the ride. | Great reliable app and gets you need to go and accomdate your service | Down to earth human great timely driver cleanly car | Excellent service. Very courteous and responded in timely manner. I recommend his service. | Wait times to get a driver and the driver to get to you has increased a lot due to some changes they did to pick driver. | Ofrecen un excelente servicio | Perfect timing üëçüèº | Shawn is amazing and perfect!!!

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don‚Äôt need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie‚ÄìHellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content ‚Äî messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don‚Äôt wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram ‚Äî join the revolution today.

While the platform has its merits, this aspect raises concerns about user experience and communication barriers. When users encounter such a message, it not only impedes social connectivity but also reflects poorly on Snapchat's functionality. This issue can deter users from fully engaging with the platform and may lead them to seek alternative means of communication. Therefore, it's essential for Snapchat to address this issue promptly to maintain user satisfaction and trust. | Pls help me out | This app is pathetic horrible. They banned you just because you accept too many friend request at once and then when you go to make another account because that account is no longer valid they Device banned u for having another account. | They device ban u for nothing in the world because you accept too many friend request, they lock your account and then when you try to make another account they locked that account and then ban your phone because you have another account it‚Äôs pathetic and the worst platform I‚Äôve ever had | Would you rather pay $13 a month to just get rid of ads on Snapchat, or be unable to skip 5 second ads every 20 SECONDS during a story on Discover? Both sound terrible, I‚Äôll pass! From now on, if I see an interesting story on Discover, I‚Äôll look for it on YouTube. I might get an ad in the middle of the video, but at least there won‚Äôt be one every 20 seconds like on Snapchat!

From the unpinnable invasion of privacy (the ‚ÄúMy AI‚Äù feature) to the horrendous amount of Snapchat+ pop ups pushing you to pay money, to the never ending amount of ads‚Ä¶Snapchat has only gone downhill since I joined back in 2013. It‚Äôll only be a matter of time until I, amongst many others, leave for good. | snapchat will lock your account for doing absolutely nothing wrong and will take away your memories. i lost 7 years of mementos for absolutely no reason. also i had snapchat plus in my accounts that were locked for no reason and can‚Äôt get a refund | BRING BACK THE SNAPCHAT GAMES. | I‚Äôm going back | Man I miss when I accidentally closed the app while I‚Äôm on call it would stay open, but when I do it, it just automatically closes the call. Like why did y‚Äôall remove that??? | Terrible. Nothing else needs to be said | Snapchat is such a fun app to use. You can take pictures text friends and post on story but I am having a hard time logging into my acc and Snapchat doesn‚Äôt make logging into a acc easy( I am still not able to log in) Intill they come back and reach out and get my acc back it is a 3 | Despite the fact that the app barely works on an iPad, which I exclusively use (I like big screens don‚Äôt judge), ever since the bitmojis were changed from cute little drawings to uncanny valley 3D clunky characters was when I stopped using it. Haven‚Äôt used it in years. I can‚Äôt stand to look at them. I edit my bitmoji and it looks great and like me! Then Snapchat converts it to a 3D monster that looks nothing like me. Pls fix. 

Also side issue & rant - your AI is so censored. When it came out, I hopped on real quick and I asked it to write a tragedy, giving it story prompts. For example I asked it to write about a couple who betrayed each other, and it said it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt promote betrayal and other negative topics.‚Äù That implies even if you portray something in a bad light, that since you are even portraying it at, means you‚Äôre obviously ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù it. I kept explaining to it that I didn‚Äôt want it portrayed as a good thing, and it just continued to argue that it wasn‚Äôt something it was allowed to do. I don‚Äôt know why this AI was made, if it can‚Äôt complete basic tasks. And this AI is a reflection of Snapchat. | GIVE ME MY PLANETS BACK THATS THE ONLY REASON I KEEP SNAPCHAT PLUS. IM NOT PLAYING GIVE THEM BACK. | I love Snapchat you get to do really cool filter it‚Äôs a lot of fun and get you get to see your friends on the map that Snapchat has | It‚Äôs completely ridiculous that you have to pay for the app for the AI to not pop up on your feed:/ not been interested with Snapchat recently | please bring back snap games

please bring back snap games | 10/10 highly recommend | my snapchat is being super glitchy | I had snapchat for I‚Äôd say over 4-5 years, and over six months ago I was wrongly device banned from the app. I tried to send multiple emails to get my account back since I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. None of the emails did anything to help me get my account back which sucked. I was and still am very disappointed as snapchat was one of my main platforms for communication, and I had years worth of memories that I hadn‚Äôt saved or had on any other platform. Nothing worked to get my account back and I am again very disappointed in this platform. | I‚Äôm so confuse my public profile got removed like everybody got their public profile but mines got remove . 

I deleted the app download it back in it still don‚Äôt show can yall please help me ! I‚Äôve been searching on YouTube on how to make your public profile show back up but no one knows how ..

My account is baccseatyungen hopefully I get a response on how to make my public profile show back up ! | I have had this snap account for many years, and have had many memories stored in it. And it‚Äôs all thrown away because someone (who doesn‚Äôt like me and could easily just report my account) reported my account. They didn‚Äôt detect anything because in my appeal I stated what the snap they referred to actually meant. Like come on!!! The snap chat username is: 

drljam2020 

If any developers could give my account a second chance please.

I emailed you all to try and get help . I have tried to login under fb and apple it doesn‚Äôt recognize my email but I‚Äôm still receiving emails. I have deleted it and downloaded again still no success. What can I do to get my account back | Convenient. Feeds my kid on the fly. Racking up points so quick I have a freebie every order. | it‚Äôs good and fresh fried food | I live the app!! Makes for a worry free transaction especially with a 3 year old! Rate this app 10/10!! Never had a problem!!! | I had a missing items equal to over $15 and I tried calling the delivery provider and they were NOT HELPFUL AT ALL AND I DID NOT GET MY MONEY BACK! So I‚Äôm out $15+! PLAESE ADD ISSUE SOLVING ON THE ACTUAL APP!!! Because CLEARLY THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK! | You can‚Äôt place an order any longer. The app constantly gives an error to try later. Waste of time. | I LOVE YOU MCDONALDS !! BRING BACK THE SNACK WRAPS AND ITS A WRAP FOR MCDONALDS IM COPPIN OUT ON ALL THEM JOINTS. AT THIS POINT MIGHT AS WELL GIFT ME A FRANCHISE THATS HOW MUCH MCDONALDS I EAT. LOVE YA | I love the free food rewards just for ordering and the deals are amazing I only spent $2 on a number 7 meal I really am loving it! | Rapid√≠sima muy buena muchos puntos | Twice now the app sent my order to the wrong restaurant hundres of miles away. I carefully double checked to make sure that the location services was on and that the restaurant appearing in the app was the one i was at by using the map on my iPhone. Still, after placing the order it was sent to another McDonald's in another city. When I called the store they said they couldn't cancel my order even though it was just a few minutes after. So they have my money and I have no food. | What the title says. | The UX on this app is terrible. It directed you to the nears McD‚Äôs based on as the crow fly, not actual roads, further complicated by changing which location it is ordering from is an abysmal experience. 

When you open the app you are prompted to use one of the promotions, but then get immediately barked at that you aren‚Äôt eligible for the deal because you have nothing else in the order.

When you change locations, sometimes any deals you had applied, vanish, and I hope you caught it, cause the app doesn‚Äôt warn you!

The ‚Äúsuggestions for you‚Äù will likely contain the exact item you just ordered.

Overall the UX on this is simply unacceptable.  If it wasn‚Äôt for ‚ÄúFree Fry Friday‚Äù and the rewards (which expire btw) I would never use this app. Come on McDonalds, you can do so much better then this. | They handed me an old and over tarter sauced sandwich | Since I start using the app, I‚Äôve been saving money‚Ä¶ | Couldn‚Äôt use the app how to go through the drive-through other times I have to go inside and have the person that‚Äôs working there do the app it‚Äôs not a simple app. When are you gonna get rid of it because this is ridiculous I stopped going to McDonald‚Äôs along time ago because of that situation. Get rd of app have specials on sat or same day at the stores!  Have the specials on the same day and put signs up and people look at your specials. You don‚Äôt have to have an app to Sign‚Äôs at the store. You have to losing money with that app thing because there‚Äôs so many of us it stopped going there because of the app situation. | I did a mobile order and pay the extra $2.60 for me to be able to replace my drink with the ice cream. Macchiato got through the drive-through line. They didn‚Äôt have caramel macchiato so I requested for the same exact modifications on my iced coffee that I had for the other coffee in my order, not only was I brought a iced coffee. It was not a caramel iced coffee and then I was charged extra for my steak egg and cheese bagel for extra onions in the bagel. Doesn‚Äôt even have any onions. I tried to call I tried. I didn‚Äôt have time to fix it because I was doing this on my break time and waiting for them to make updates after I already waited an additional few minutes by pulling up in the line for order I submitted in advance to make sure it was ready when I got there, those modifications weren‚Äôt there I didn‚Äôt have time to sit and wait to get back to work and then on top of everything else try to call the actual location itself and no one‚Äôs answering the phones so I just have to eat the fact that I paid extra for a lot of different things that I didn‚Äôt get and I can‚Äôt get it fixed because I‚Äôm back at work now just very disappointed and does not make it easy for you to try to contact someone or submit a request letting them know my order wasn‚Äôt right at all so yeah | It‚Äôs seems seriously quicker to order in person than to use any of the ways to order on the app. | I can‚Äôt make an order. It keeps asking me to sign in when I‚Äôm already signed in. | This dumb app often sends the order to the wrong location | Amazing | McDonald‚Äôs app is by far the most basic level of. Applications as they come and I don‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs simple it‚Äôs like they were to cheap to hire real programmers, you can‚Äôt add additional things or customize your orders. The point system is a joke complement limited and low end items are the only thing offered. They could do so much better. | Love this place, always gets my food done fast! | According to the person they only want you to use mobile kiosk. Terrible customer service | I went to submit an order and a prompt popped up saying my new order total. This total was more than double what my original amount was. After clicking ‚Äúno‚Äù i realized items i never added were in my cart. I took them out. i then went to submit my actual order only to find out this app charged me full price for the cart that NEVER EVEN MADE. Why ask if this new price is okay if you‚Äôre just gonna charge me anyway. Then to get help thru the app or any way for that matter is jumping through hoops. So now i go to work with nothing in me. This is beyond upsetting since i dont have much money to live off of and just wanted to treat myself. | App constantly connects to closest restaurant instead of one I pick in app if you go out for even a second. Once I pick a restaurant I want that one, not whatever is closest. Why can‚Äôt it remember my favorites and let me pick fast? | Just started using the app and have already saved on the cost. | Quick & Easy | i‚Äôm lovin it | I wrote to support since half of my food was not delivered they processed to tell me I need more info and the date store info a day later. Then I submitted the information and a picture of all the information just for them respond a day later and say they can‚Äôt help to contact the third party of the delivery. If I could give a zero rating I would | I am on medical bed rest! I love the mobile app because my delivery man is my husband and best friend. Thank you McDonalds! | It‚Äôs a good app, just the worst rewards offerings from any restaurant to ever exist in the history of rewards apps.  Can‚Äôt expect anything more from McDonalds, because you know, it‚Äôs McDonald‚Äôs. | 90% of the time I am told my code isn‚Äôt good. What good is the app giving me a code I can never use? They need to fix that. | Best App. Best rewards. Most Accommodating. | You can definitely place an order through this app. Be prepared to deal with mass amounts of pop ups offer add ons. I probably eat McDonald‚Äôs more than I should so the points do add up which is nice. I‚Äôve also had issue with trying to place an order and it constantly changing the location I‚Äôm ordering for. A few times I‚Äôve had orders go to the wrong locations because of this. | Wish that I could use more than one deal at a time | Can‚Äôt access lunch menu and can‚Äôt use deals for burgers because it‚Äôs stuck on breakfast and there‚Äôs no way to change or fix it. Also redownloading the app didn‚Äôt work | So much free or discounted food üòä | Simply | This app is so janky. Changing my meal size deletes any customizations? This is basic coding and you guys can‚Äôt figure it out? Oof. | I luvvvv Mcdonalddssssa | Horrible | It‚Äôs a great app don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs way too expensive. | They didn‚Äôt give me all my Mc nuggets. | Guy at the drive through walked me through using the app he was very patient and friendly. | The app is great. I love the discount or should I say my kids love the discounts of the minor glitches here and there is efficient | Me gusta | Ordered condiments thru the app but had to ask for them. So the service is mediocre at best even with the app. Should have gone to Chick-fil-a. My mistake! | I‚Äôm an oldie - not very tech savvy - but I must say the McDonald‚Äôs website is very easy to navigate - simple to order - good experience | I used to use the app pretty often since it‚Äôs convenient for where I work. However it never works anymore and it‚Äôs really frustrating. I will go through the whole process and it lets me get to payment and it says there experiencing technical problems. I have deleted and redownloaded multiple times and tried different payment methods and it never works. | Yum",4.813,4082166,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6f/8e/30/6f8e30d2-9fc1-59c1-fa35-50cb0d8e9a7b/b28364fe-bb62-4368-9378-2153c033c2b4_Image1_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2e/1e/50/2e1e5071-cbef-c8e8-02a1-5d4404bc24de/a19aea51-0934-4dcf-8128-e9119a05ef85_Image2_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f6/06/17/f6061789-f61e-5095-1915-944ff7c73d53/35ddf8ac-16d2-4b5a-a610-9951ea0c0325_Image3_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a7/f3/08/a7f30845-1584-c272-50f0-7402dd816825/9d4177ec-b31b-4040-a2a5-00551d55e959_Image4_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/49/58/26/4958266a-e1b3-1100-2d44-9c4fd5d0412a/632500dd-991c-4f20-9552-929d1edab2b2_Image5_ios5.5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

No matter where they are I can check on them. | I love how it tracks where u are going and ITS JUST GREAT NO EXPLAINING | SO GOOD!! | This app definitely helps to keep tabs on love ones and family member but the work of such tracking apps is usually limited because you always need to access the device you want to keep tabs on in order for the tracking app to work effectively. My question is if i can access the device i want to hack, why would I need it hacked ? But i understand we hack devices due to different intentions and to recover some informations that must have been deleted or kept from being easily seen, the device we need to be intercepted or completely cloned at times.
Infidelity causes a lot of trauma that might be very difficult to cope with if vou don't have an account of what is really going down with your partner when you are not together. If you keep getting these signs it's most likely to be true your partner is cheating. That's not the end of life anyway, you can make a choice that suite you and be to your advantage for something like that to never repeat itself. For anyone that find themselves in this situation, what you need is to contact a private ethical investigator named Raphael, mail him at { cryptorecovery360 @ Gmail com }for any reasonable proof before you confront your cheating partner about infidelity. His services are highly rated and affordable, regardless whether your problem is personal or commercial he will help you, put your worries aside and give yourself a peace of mind you deserve. I'm a witness of his helpful service and i highly recommend him. | I love knowing when my family will arrive, whether it‚Äôs for a party, dinner, because we‚Äôre supposed to carpool, etc. I also love being able to check when my friends are at work and when they make it home safely. I wish I could get more place alerts for free and that they wouldn‚Äôt push memberships so hard, but other than that, great app! | Me and my friends are always asking each other where they are, so this was the perfect solution! Now we can know where each other are at any time! | The battery percentage needs to be fully updated so we can see every percentage. Keeps lagging currently | The number of bugs I‚Äôve found in this app especially around adding emergency contacts is nuts. I can also make the app crash easily. Turning into a joke at this point. | Was trying to make an account for the first time but my phone died in the middle of trying to set it up and I never even got to make a password and when I tried to redo it after putting my name and email in it says I already have an account and asked for a password that I never made ! I can‚Äôt even make an account because of that because when I enter my email it acts like I have an account already just because my phone died after I entered my email in but before I was ever even able to make a password! That doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all !! Everyone I know has this app and loves it but this is a very bad start for me to even was to try it now since I can‚Äôt even set up an account now | One of the most useful apps, shows you what your friends battery is, there location and how fast they‚Äôre going. | It will state that you need to update the app and your location but when you update it you still not be located and unable to bid on loads for freight companies. | Must have for anyone with a kid old enough to carry a smartphone, and for more reasons than I have time to even sit here and explain. | This morning at 0500 I drove my normal route to work, following my routine to the letter. I had laid my phone on the bedcover on my truck and drove 15 miles to work and noticed when I had arrived that my phone was no where to be found. I drove back home and alerted my spouse of the loss, she checked her 360 app (it did not dawn on me to do this, she is amazing!) it showed that my phone was 10 miles from our home on the opposite side of the highway. So, off we went in search of my phone, thinking all was lost. When we arrived my wife handed me her phone and I watched the 360 app and walked straight to my phone with her app. Saved me a ton of money and stress. | Use this everyday to track my man | The only thing that i don‚Äôt like too much about life 360 is that in my circle with my parents, my dads location is always refreshed but my mom never is so i have to wait 5 minutes every time i wanna see where she is. | I did not like my experience with life 360 at all it keeps glitching and only allowing me to see if someone in my family had a crash I had to pay for a membership fee and it completely took over my calling and texting I do not recommend this app | This app is NEVER accurate and that can create problems. We have been using this for a number of years but we are ready to get rid of it and get an app that will actually sow locations more accuratly. | I share this with my friend group and it works great | This app is so accurate! Twice my husband has lost his cellphone. And twice I have found it, right where it was. It was so accurate that I had address n exact location at the address. The first time it was in a parking lot covered in snow. When the snow melted 3 months later, I was able to drive right up to it, pick it up n it was still tracking it even though it was dead! Unbelievable! My cousin keeps track of her kids. She never worries about them. You can keep track of your keys, wallet n more. My husband losses everything! I will forever be a loyal consumer! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | This app has been very useful to help with communication between loved ones and scheduling of daily affairs | It‚Äôs great most of time but dose lag a lot | No | This company forces u to be a 7 day trial member leaving u with nothing they provide making u take a 7 day free trial is bad business especially when u offered to be a paying customer! Do NO TRUST THIS APP!! IT LIES | I love it because I know where everyone is | Keep those teenagers on track and hold them accountable! | I really likes it | I hate this app and I want it deleted as well as many other people. | This app is helpful! | I‚Äôm a chronic location checker lol. I was using find my friends daily until I found this app, and can admit I love all the features life 360 offers. 

However if I‚Äôm going to pay $14.99 a month, I want all the perks to be included for everyone in the app. Not just one circle. Realistically I can‚Äôt put everyone I know in the same circle, so having to pay $14.99 for every circle, every month is way too much. 

It would‚Äôve been a 5 star but those charges are ridiculous. | Awesome app! Just have to get kids to keep it on with phone charged. | Kids can offload the app and make it look like they‚Äôre somewhere they‚Äôre not, they can also pause their location. | We live in a heavy traffic area and have three young drivers, this app helps us ensure that they are getting where they are expected safely and we don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúcheck on them‚Äù by calling or texting essentially distracting the young drivers. | I can‚Äôt do anything with out my dad stalking me | I didn‚Äôt use the app yet and I put my birthday (I‚Äôm 14) it says I‚Äôm under 13 and now I need parents ID bruh | This is an amazing app. I absolutely recommend this to all the parents. | Love this app it‚Äôs amazing | I love this app the location is correct at all times even when u don‚Äôt have ur phone with u or it‚Äôs lost just ask someone who has ur location to tell u I highly recommend | sometimes it says bike when in a car but 10/10 i love stalking my bf | can't even get it off my phone terrible | We love Life360, it allows us to see where our kids are without calling them constantly. If you have college age kids, this is a wonderful way to see that their travels are going safely, with speed notifications and exact ETA. We highly recommend this app! | I have 2 young kids and it‚Äôs so awesome to be able to see everyone in real time. The kids know where we are and vice versa. 
I can‚Äôt imagine life without 360 now üíú | It is so good I know where my family is when I need them mhh so good 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | The location never loads. Always saying last updated 40 minutes ago. | i think that this app is great to see where ur kids are and to track them and see if someone is on there way or not and if you haven‚Äôt seen someone in a long time than you can see what they are up to all though it can be a little pricing to get certain things but other than that this app is great | you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything and it‚Äôs a really good way to keep up with your family and to watch them to make sure they are safe and i really love the crash detector feature it‚Äôs really safe and good for anyone so if you get in a accident your okay | This app USE to be great. My parents and I would use it when i was younger. I continued to use it even after I moved out but it seems like once it blew up and everyone started to use it they took away a few features that you now have to pay for a subscription to have. Also from what I have heard once you pay for a subscription you start to have issues with certain things in the app. | This app is amazing, not too much I can say about it that other people haven‚Äôt already said. I wish it would also work on Apple Watches though. | I love this app especially for my family. We can see where everyone is at any time. My friends and I all have this app and it can help us to do things like seeing who is on there way to practice or who is close to the competition and so much more. AWESOME app and I highly recommend.

I also love the Prime membership perks, like free shipping and access to exclusive deals and shows. It's definitely worth considering if you're a frequent shopper.

Just tell the truth, I will buy it somewhere else. | Not only did it randomly start charging me for Amazon prime, it double charged people I know | And that‚Äôs just the start. I deleted the iPad app years ago because it always opened when I wanted to browse Amazon. Makes sense, the app takes over from the browser. Except the app has never had all the functionality of the website. Like I said I haven‚Äôt tried it in years, so I‚Äôm curious if the app has gotten better. If it would provide a pleasant shopping experience I‚Äôd keep it. If it‚Äôs still rubbish at handling lists, doing any ‚Äòadministrative‚Äô stuff (my account, deep dive things like my digital library, purchase history, etc), and basically just a SUBSET of the Amazon website, then I‚Äôll delete it again. Why have a lesser experience? Also I worry about installing apps from companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, because they *always* try to harvest as much data about you as they can, through legal means and often by stealth means. I don‚Äôt want my personal data harvested just like I don‚Äôt want my organs harvested, so I am reluctant to trust apps from companies that are known offenders. The end. (I‚Äôll update my score depending on what I feel about using the app in 2024.)

P.S. I forgot to mention, **** Alexa. If I wanted to use a data gathering spy function, I‚Äôd just call up Donald Trump and ask him for the number to the Russian FSB. I don‚Äôt even use Siri, and I trust it the most. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm chatting with a bot from a company whose entire purpose is to sell me things and put most of the profit into Jeff Bezos‚Äôs bald, swole pockets. I‚Äôm not helping him go to space or become a trillionaire if I can help it. You b*st*ards killed off indie bookstores and mom and pop shops all over the world! Grr. | I love Amazon it has everything you need and comes in on time and fast but one thing that I think that they should add is different tabs or different carts so you can have one cart for clothes one for school supplies and one for decor. This way it is easier to shop normally but also for birthday presents, for children they can put the stuff that they want in their Amazon cart and they can have like their own cart on the same account. | Crashes constantly, need to load every page twice, AI hijacks and slows down ability to search for keywords in reviews | Thank you Amazon for letting me be a customer I offering to give five stars to you for 1 million stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èü§© | Me estafaron atraves de esta app y era de la tienda directa de restored de Amazon, hice mi compra y recibi una caja con un cable. Mi compra la habia diferido pq me dieron la opcion al pagar y me llega la sorpresa que no se difiri√≥ mi compra y me llego el cargo en una sola exhibici√≥n. AMAZON ES UN FRAUDE. | I made an order and put my address. The day I was supposed to receive my order I got a notification that they were able because they can‚Äôt do PO Box. My complaint is why didn‚Äôt they let me know in the moment of making my order. | The app itself is good not great. Buggy at times, product pages or searches won‚Äôt display at times.
Biggest issue for me is way to much sponsored products when getting search results. After a search, the very first product will be something sponsored that doesn‚Äôt match up with search filters and while scrolling down 3 to 4 products will be sponsored while one is something that I actually search for so basically for me I‚Äôm getting six out of every 10 is something sponsored not what I‚Äôm looking for. It‚Äôs unfortunate that I use Amazon so much because it is convenient but I think I‚Äôm just gonna have to bite the bullet and shop elsewhere. | I love their return policy and the way they support the people who buy from them | Amazon prime is awesome got anything you could possibly want or need. i just stop going out for shopping. | App constantly freezes, this update and during days right before this update. The ""still loading..."" blank white page, while trying to look at  various items, multiple sellers.  The page will never load, can only close the app and start all over again! Happens multiple times per day. Ridiculous waste of time, very poor. | When viewing items saved in cart it always kicks you back to top of page. If you have 50 items saved in your cart and you view an item down the list it kicks you back to the top of the page when you go back to your cart and you have to scroll all the way down again. It‚Äôs impossible to view your cart if you have more than a few items saved. Please fix this so you don‚Äôt have to scroll all the way back down through your cart after viewing an item. This makes it impossible to used if you have many items saved for later purchase | When did you guys change the usage of amazon gift cards to buy other gift card and why does it matter? You‚Äôre still getting paid either way but now that you limited usage of amazon gift cards to physical items rather than gift cards is MONEY LOSS FOR YOU.

I‚Äôm never putting my credit card in this dumb app, I hope to God you‚Äôre aware of that. | But I find the subscribe and save to not be a benefit at times.  I think you should have an order subscription now.  Like when I‚Äôm out of cat food and dog practically in the End of March I had to wait till April First to send ship and save.  So I would not have got in time.  The ship and save did not honor specials that the manufacture of coupon was holding at the time but just buying once outside of subscribe.  I find it different to locate the area on the website for ship and save and it‚Äôs difficult as well to cancel a subscription order‚Ä¶ your 13 Merv Air Filters are excellent quality thought I would try a 46 dollar six month supply‚Ä¶this product I should set for subscription because they get dusty after 3 months but the Merv 13 simaler to 3M that I usually get at Walmart but so much simpler to have delivered to my door.  I think these breath better than 3ms filter top of the line both 3M and the brand that‚Äôs 20x20x1 Merv 13 with Amazon takes viruses and bacteria out of the air plus common dust smoke pet dander people dander dust mites‚Ä¶.very quality filter hats of to your buyers and a New company its seams expensive but people indoor air can be more polluted than outdoor air‚Ä¶dived 46 by 6 months or so may last longer than six months and will last 12 months or longer if you only have one filter.  Mine takes two 20x20x1 buy your correct size filter many sizes and Ladies that live alone if you don‚Äôt know or been told you change the furnace for the AC heat regularly.  Guys too I don‚Äôt think filter changing was taught in high school. I just can imagine dusty filters that someone has not changed in years!!  No dust‚Ä¶Merv 13 that‚Äôs the best rated Air Filters‚Ä¶Woody Allen said, ‚ÄúNever trust air you can‚Äôt see!‚Äù

I have also worked for Amazon and may return for employment‚Ä¶let me tell you folks it is a very fast paced company but extremely organized, productive team of employees that take there job serious in getting same day and next day or special order items to you fast!!  I‚Äôm amazed at the automation but still hands are needed to get a package to your door safe and sound‚Ä¶I much recommend Amazon Prime with Amazon Video you get all the series and movies and expedited shipping‚Ä¶who does not want same or next day shipping ok don‚Äôt get it and wait for your packages.  It‚Äôs very affordable when you think of the production cost for movies and series‚Ä¶they are so many selections on Amazon Video you won‚Äôt need another movie channel unless you want other particular shows‚Ä¶but you can find almost every movie on Amazon Prime or be able to rent from someone else if not free with Amazon.  I have never besides Blockbuster RedBox and smaller video stores had to rent a movie with Amazon Prime.  You divide $16.41 in half Amazon Prime and Amazon Video the cost of the monthly service and that‚Äôs $8.20 that‚Äôs movies for $8.20 and expedited shipping for $8.20‚Ä¶where can you see a movie even at the 2$ 3$ cinemas still open in the US with drink and popcorn or candy your probably close to 15 dollars for discounted cinema.  I‚Äôm a artist not a math teacher‚Ä¶but if you don‚Äôt have Amazon Prime and Amazon Video tell them Keith Sent you to consider signing up an alumni employee at Amazon‚Ä¶They really have great series of all kinds of genre‚Ä¶ask if you can get the first month free?!?!  It never hurts to ask Walmart at 12.99 a month with Paramount I cancelled Walmart has difficulty getting into my building they won‚Äôt add notes for drivers Amazon does‚Ä¶who wants a driver aimlessly driving around waisting gas trying to find you with out special instructions Amazon if you have made orders purchases allows you to do this.  Don don‚Äôt ask me how to cancel Amazon Prime but why would you‚Ä¶the fastest shipping company in the world to your front door‚Ä¶of everything imaginable to purchase‚Ä¶my quartz and crystal collection is very nice I must say and beautiful‚Ä¶from Amazon‚Ä¶Thanks for great service, excellent employees‚Ä¶and free employee coffee and cappuccinos machines, tea and sometimes hydration punch pouches‚Ä¶this company ROCKs the house with stereo now and than driven on safety and FUN!!

But don‚Äôt worry if your late don‚Äôt be but you may use personal time to add minutes for your start time on the app or HR to not have a late occurrence on your work schedule.  But they drop off after so many weeks if you forget to record a late due to traffic or circumstances.  Also Amazon Pays Same day of work you just easily securely transfer to your bank account the amount you want other wise it sends on regular pay day any other hours of pay.  When you have a bill that‚Äôs due on a day when you need funds for it same day pay is choice.  Very effective benifit‚Ä¶ok if you read this far‚Ä¶and are looking for employment.  I would just Google how to find a job with Amazon and I‚Äôm sure you will find instructions on who to text or what website to go to for potential Amazon Job Listings‚Ä¶Amazonian you will become if hired pass an HR drug test you administer yourself a mouth swab have to follow detailed instructions‚Ä¶be clean you will be fine very easy like self service hiring‚Ä¶you pick a job discription that best suits you and pay various on positions.

Unfortunately it seems to lock up crash or randomly kicked me out several times per use. I hope there will be a fix for this problem. that‚Äôs OK I‚Äôm stunned and I still haven‚Äôt been filled in and I‚Äôm freaking out. | Recently Amazon released an AI ‚Äúassistant‚Äù they‚Äôre calling Rufus. The menu to activate it sits in a bar on the bottom of the screen, constantly eating up screen space and you expand it by swiping up. You know the same motion you do to try and scroll through product listings. Rufus makes the app unusable, it‚Äôs menu constantly gets expanded, it doesn‚Äôt know anything and gives answers contrary to what the actual product pages say, it‚Äôs just a piece of trash that I wish I could permanently turn off. | Amazon locked my account and i don‚Äôt know why | I love Amazon! Lots of sales all the time! No spending on shipping if a prime member and Amazon shows and movies are good too. 
What more can I say?! | Please add dark mode. Please. | The app is sucking right now. So buggy! | If your internet service is less than perfect,  this app DOES NOT WORK 

I am sick of your cartoon dogs.

FIX IT ! | They said my package arrived but I the package I received was not mine. It was a different package ordered from another person in my house and I never received my item. | Prime isn‚Äôt cheap and free shipping doesn‚Äôt save you money when they ship it to the post office by USPS and you have to takeoff from work to get there when they‚Äôre open because they can‚Äôt stick the stuff in the lock boxes. I like it when I ship it UPS you can track it. I have one shipment on its way from April 8 and Amazon tracking is safe to contact the shipper.

I still used netflix despite they‚Äôre constant adding and removing movies and shows, upping the price, etc.  But the fact that I am FORCED off of my family‚Äôs account because I am in COLLEGE is ridiculous.  They‚Äôre a multi million dollar corporation and act like they are looking for money in between couch cushions.

I‚Äôm a college student why should my parents pay 40+ for a bare minimum stream. | Remove household mane | They think giving bigots a platform is giving their viewers options. But in smart countries where hate speech is illegal they wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to put that garbage up. 
Promoting a transphobic cis man (for example) actually generates more dead trans people. It creates more hardships for a group of people who have no federal protections and are losing their rights in many states. It‚Äôs like platforming a Klansman during the Jim Crow era and acting like they just want to create options. Then they post Black stories as if they really care about Black lives. Just as they‚Äôll have LGBTQ+ films as if they care about us. This is rainbow capitalism. Pure and simple. They can‚Äôt profit off bigots and the discriminated alike. It‚Äôs opportunistic and utterly despicable. | Netflix, my family and I have been a customer for 8+ years.. u have the audacity to 2FA me?

It‚Äôs my family, get over it. Stop asking me to log in multiple times. Thanks | Netflix is the best Entertainment app. I have been watching Netflix since I was 5 ( I am 8 ). And I think that Netflix will get more subscribers if you add some more stuff, like Sonic 1, the adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, Jailer, Pathaan, Kong vs Godzilla 1 and 2 and finally Godzilla 3. Oh, sorry, and Sonic the Hedgehog TV show, Goosebumps, Pac-Man, Harry Potter, Transformers 3, Batman, all seasons of Gumball and the Knuckles series which released today. But anyways, I for one, think that Netflix has great movies, but could have a bit better ones. But Netflix by itself is nice, with good movies and all. | I have never seen a company I such dire need of new management horrible decisions are being made here and a lot of customers unsubscribing soon. | The whole point of mobile Netflix is to use it on the go! So why wont it let me use it when I am not on the ""Household"" wifi ! Netflix has become greedy and I wont be using it anymore! Let families share netflix! | I hate the fact that you can't pause or cancel a subscription on a gift card and come back a month or two later to finish off what was on that gift card. This should be a easy fix yet they haven't fixed this issue. They literally force you to use up your gift card which in my opinion that's kind of like a scam/robbery because I should be able to use my card cash at any time that I want. Instead of forced to give it all away at one time. | New household rule is stupid. I don‚Äôt wanna have to move my ps4 from room to room just to watch it because I have several devices for several different reasons connected for convenience.

They‚Äôll do anything for more money. | i gave this a five star review because it has been the best watching movie app I have ever used so far I like how there are no ads and you get to get catch up on what movies that they will be releasing on the app and I like how they have a lot of anime choices for you to watch personally I love watching anime and I like how they add different type of anime for people to watch that like watching anime so I think this deserves a five star review so that is a five star...... | So when I went I watch a show sometimes I like to use the sliding part of the video so I can easily find the scene I want more quicker and they way it works is when you go to slide the little knob it will show a visual of what you want to find but now they just give you the time and try to guess where the scene you want is, this is infuriating. | I wish it did not have the travel thing on it | 1. I think there could be a quicker login when you first get in to it and I think that‚Äôs all it could use but over all it‚Äôs pretty good and worth buying and spending your money on | I am the owner of this Netflix. Today I get a message on m6 iPhone that its not part of the account‚Ä¶.what? I can‚Äôt use my account on my own phone. This is ridiculous. I‚Äôm canceling, this is just too stupid for words. | This app is grea‚Äî thought I was gonna start with that? NAW!! Here you can watch all of ya fav shows and more. There can be multiple choice, or Netflix games! Funny how I haven‚Äôt written a review for this yet. Well now I did! Recommended!!!! | I have always loved Netflix,especially now that I‚Äôm gettin older.I do wannna suggest a few things.One I wish yall would put a teen profile cause there are a lot of bad movies and it‚Äôll be nice to have the good action and sci-fi movies yet not stuff like sex life pop up we already have hormones pep!!Second pls stop takin off all the good stuff like soul surfer and Godzilla.Anyway,overall it‚Äôs a great app Ty | Hi! I like to tell why I only give it a three, I think the fact that you can only watch Netflix in the location of WiFi is so stupid, I‚Äôm a high schooler and I can‚Äôt watch Netflix in art and I don‚Äôt want to have to go through no code thing, no other app does that, Disney and Hulu don‚Äôt and many more don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs very annoying and I think you should get rid of it and now I can‚Äôt even watch Netflix on my tv at HOME so please Netflix get rid of it, I don‚Äôt know why you created it but it‚Äôs annoying | REVERT NOW THANKS | the premium is 10 dollar and the standard 8 dollar and the basic is 4 ??   
the standard should be 6 or 7 am i right | I can‚Äôt even watch Netflix anymore when I‚Äôm traveling because of the new household thing. This is incredibly absurd will never use again; the prices keep rising while the quality drops. | You guys have good shows, great even. But you‚Äôre greed is just too much. Y‚Äôall care more about money than entertainment and want every cent out of your clients. Despicable. Forcing people to buy HD plans just to watch a show they like that‚Äôs already on Netflix but partially blocked because they can only afford the ‚Äúwith ads‚Äù plan. Terrible. | I‚Äôm not using this anymore and what am I going to be using to watch movies because it‚Äôs not gonna be thisüò≠ | I am my mothers son and I am on our WiFi and it‚Äôs saying I‚Äôm not part of the family?!?!  Y‚Äôall need to fix your app and take this back off, y‚Äôall are already down, and y‚Äôall are gonna have a failed service because people will not put up with this! | I find the not allowed to share accounts very useless | You have the best shows ever nobody will ever compare to you and moviesüçøBut can u please add the taylor swift eras tour movie that would really be nice cause my favorite singer ever Anyways love uü©µü©∑ | This has become a ridiculous problem to me as a college student who moved out of my home country for opportunity. I‚Äôd like to destress after college and watch some shows but recently I haven‚Äôt been able to access my account because of the one household option thing. They need to go to make sure I‚Äôm in the same household, but I‚Äôm telling them I‚Äôm a 20 hour away flight from my country. In order to keep accessing my profile, I would need to create a different account and this is just ridiculous. Why would you need to pay for two different accounts if we‚Äôre in the same family. 
I‚Äôm definitely rethinking as to whether I should continue Netflix or just cancel my account this is just preposterous | I‚Äôm a college student that can‚Äôt come home often. My family pays for Netflix but because I can‚Äôt connect to my home WiFi I just can‚Äôt use the Netflix app at all. Netflix isn‚Äôt loosing customers that don‚Äôt buy a Netflix subscription because the people that password share wouldn‚Äôt buy Netflix in the first place. | Expecting everyone to pay in a household? Canceled membership. | I love Netflix I watch it on my iPad EVERY day and it has 0 glitches 0 ads 0 problems and something even cooler is that if your going on a long plane trip you can download your shows and movies you want to watch plus you can log in anywhere and it makes sure no one else can use it if you forgot to log out of it it won‚Äôt let anyone else us it I think you should get Netflix best App EVER 
!üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÑüòÑ | I like the content they show here but the some lack new stuff I was hope to see miller girl here bc it show up on coming soon but they took it off for some reason it would be also nice to get more compeleted series‚Äôs of movies | Constantly having to reload everything on my tv. Sometimes it takes over an hour just to get it to play. Internet works great we have high speed fiber from century link and when tested performs very well. The tv works great with everything else but every time we try and watch Netflix it‚Äôs a whole process to get anything to stream and that‚Äôs after trying to scroll through the selections which also takes forever because every click of the remote Netflix takes atleast 30 seconds to process and load everything in its new spot. Sometimes I can‚Äôt even scroll through because it won‚Äôt even load the selections or it freezes as soon as it load some options. This company took something great( an affordable well working program that provided great entertainment with no ads) and turned it into a broken piece of garbage. But atleast you learned how to edit the audio so you can‚Äôt hear people talk but the background music is overwhelmingly loud at any volume. I call it the covid effect, just like everything else since covid a good thing has turned to trash just cause ef it right who cares about anything anymore. | Por que van a eliminar todas las pel√≠culas de Jurassic Park de 1993 a 2001? Son buenas, adem√°s de que eliminaron la primera del
megalodon. Son pel√≠culas que adoro y disfruto bastante, me entristece que las hayan sacado. | It‚Äôs really good | Tour prices are ridiculous and then you don‚Äôt let PIP for the cheap plan for iOS? This is why I use your service for about a month a year and cancel. | The app isn‚Äôt what it use to be when it comes to info on a show or movie. It used to tell us the languages and whether it‚Äôs dubbed or not, but it don‚Äôt anymore. Should bring that back. Went to watch Shaman King Flowers only for it to be subbed only. Didn‚Äôt say anything in the info. Smh‚Ä¶. | I have been using my family account forever! And now you are telling me I have to make another account because we live far from each other? What stupidity is this?!? Why even create shared accounts when you remove shared part of it. Internet is global and it connects helps, you are literally taking that and making it a mailing system! Do better! | Your corporation is so greedy for not allowing phones to be on accounts. I‚Äôm not paying you more money for multiple devices. Very disappointing | Netflix has allowed their greed to turn them into the worst of the big streaming platforms. I can‚Äôt cast to my TV from my phone so I never watch Netflix at night anymore. I use HBO or Hulu even if I‚Äôm in the middle of a Netflix show. A shame because the content is good but I‚Äôm weaning myself completely off and look forward to the day I finally stop giving this trash service my money | So there is a problem where the out of screen thing where you can get off of the app and still have the video playing, its not working so i hope Netflix sees this and fixes this problem. Otherwise it is a pretty good app! | Crushed the competition. The business strategy now is to see how much they can get out of you while giving you less and less.

Onto my menu, especially the Apple App.  Find this app among others irritating.  If I wanted to download an app, I will do so on my own!!! | Great | This is great for when you normally lose your remote and I highly recommend it it is really good it helps with TVs so like if you can‚Äôt find your remote when you‚Äôre about to go to practice just flip it on your phone and you can turn off your TV and it is so amazing.

I love that I can pick and choose what I want. I can different things every single day. It‚Äôs just amazing.

I had an issue that required a simple fix and within 24 hours it was resolved. This does not happen a lot with subscriptions so I appreciate the immediate attention and willingness to see it through. It reaffirmed my love for Roku and I will continue as a happy customer! | For some reason it‚Äôs not able to pick up any of my Roku boxes, it‚Äôs not my internet because I‚Äôve checked | Did Roku remove this from the app I looked it up your supposed be able to do this without paying for a screen mirroring app | What am I paying for??? | I love it | I I k everything | It‚Äôs good I like it so much | I don‚Äôt understand I‚Äôve pointed my iPad at the TV over and over I‚Äôve typed the IP address.

I used to love it. It was super convenient whenever our daughter misplaced our remote. However, for the last year this app has been terrible. It‚Äôs constantly claiming to not be connected to wifi when my phone shows WiFi connection as does my Roku device. Sometimes when i open the app, my WiFi disappear and i don‚Äôt have this issue with any other app. A lot of times it take 10-15 minutes to get to whatever app I‚Äôm trying to get to. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I‚Äôve tried resetting my Roku device and nothing helps.

Adding an extra way things can go wrong is never a good idea. If your Roku breaks (and it will) you will be forced to buy a new one in order to access your prepaid service. You cannot just access on your iPad or other device. Not to mention the auto-debit feature on an annual basis is a cheap shot! It‚Äôs takes $150.00 outta your account with no warning. This is the default setup, and is very one-sided. They don‚Äôt want to make a customer happy; they want to extract as much money from you as possible by any means necessary, sacrificing long term customer rentention for short term financial gain.

I love you Roku bbyü§óü•πüíûü´∂üèæü´µüèæ.. | I‚Äôve noticed that there are differences between features included in the Roku app that appear on android but not iPhone. For instance, the images on the App Store show the app remote control with a power button, but the app doesn‚Äôt have this on iPhone. Samsung has the feature, but not iPhone? 

Otherwise the app is cool, works well. Just wish I could have the option to power off on my mobile phone. | Love Roku smart home and streaming | I love this app. The problem is with private listening. Often times you can't use other apps on your phone while using private listening. 

When you use other other apps on your phone even if there is no sound associated with those apps, those other apps are able to take focus away from the Roku, so it stops the sound from playing.

I pay full price for Amazon Prime!!! | I‚Äôve been a member for a long time. Lately the app is not loading properly and movie choices are slim. Unless you rent movies. | First i buy prime, it has no ads at first then they say guess what buddy, now you have to pay an extra 3 dollars a month to avoid wasting your time with nonsense. | Despite paying for a prime membership, every episode and movie is interrupted multiple times to play ads. Waste money elsewhere. | i‚Äôll pause an episode and close the app, when i go back to continue watching it rewinds me back up to three episodes. please fix this | ads.... | All the money I pay to be a prime member and the price keeps going up, now Amazon prime is charging more to not have ads and 3 min worth of ads every 5 mins is ridiculous stupid. I‚Äôm already paying for all these extra subscriptions so each month I spending over $50 and still have to watch ads is stupid. I honestly might cancel my subscriptions and my prime membership soon. | Doesn't support subtitles in the Arabic language 
And for some time u feeling ur in India 
Netflix win | If I watch ads and by mistake back the video. I have to rewatch ads. Dumb! Fix this! After watching ads make it so we don‚Äôt have to watch ads for at least one minute so we can get back to where we were watching! | This app is just a hot mess! It is so disorganized and yet again they‚Äôre showing so much content that I would have to pay extra aka buying or renting content, instead of showing me what‚Äôs included in my subscription to Amazon prime. Seasons are still separate instead of all being under one thumbnail (hey Amazon do what everyone else is doing when it comes to organizing, trust me it‚Äôs better) going back to Amazon prime, prime video was included at no extra cost and yet after record-breaking profits Amazon decided to now include ads and charge us extra to remove those ads ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. looks like I won‚Äôt be watching any of the Amazon originals anytime soon‚Ä¶an iptv service sounds better and better‚Ä¶ | I absolutely hate the ads! They shift my focus every time. I can‚Äôt see any value in the Prime membership anymore. | I pay for Amazon prime but prime video is not in the monthly payment of 14.99? I keep trying to watch videos and it tells me to pay an additional 8.99$ a month to watch a movie? Never seen that before. | You get absolutely no value for your money with this app. You have to pay a subscription to watch the few (3 or 4) actually good shows they have, but thats not the problem. This new freevee thing where you have to watch ads is literally going to kill the app. I already thought their subscription price was a little high, but now on top of that you have to watch ads on 99% of the free shows and 100% of the good shows/movies. If thats not enough, the ads are to a point that you have a 1:1 ratio (1 min of movie = 1 minute of ads). Finally to add the cherry on top, they force the show writters to change important aspects of the show/movie so that it fits more with the agenda they push. Go sign up for Hulu and get some bang for your buck. Wish i could add my screenshot as proof but apparently not possible (7 min into movie = 5 ads) | I have prime and (no adds) but when i open the app nothing is available? It all says ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù or ‚Äúrent‚Äù only things i can watch are prime originals, what‚Äôs going on? I can watch loads of content on my iPhone or tv but not my ipad? | As a Prime customer I am outraged. | How many more trillions does Amazon need to make before the greed settles and we can have ad free subscriptions back? | Prime has a lot of popular movies and tv shows but you have to pay extra for most of them. On prime you have to pay extra to watch the sopranos, The Last of Us, Game Of Thrones, House Of The Dragons, and Banshee but you can watch all those shows on HBO max without having to pay extra | Wow this app is frustrating! You would think prime video would be less glitchy after charging users extra for no ads. Every single time I use the app, there are issues. My ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù list is always gone. I resume watching a show and it brings me back to an episode 2 seasons ago. When I turn my screen off and then back on, the show I‚Äôm watching freezes while rotated and I have to restart the app all over. Please fix!!! | Slowest video playing app. | Prime ruined the app with ads. | Ghhhj | So when I download it took a wile but overall it was good | Just a Wonderful Show.  The stories are great.  The casting is perfection.  Never get tired of this timeless show.1 | One month before this current update on 4/24/24, I downloaded three movies. I was only able to watch one on the plane and then the other two greyed out and it said I needed internet to watch my downloads. I tried everything to get it to work. I‚Äôm excellent with navigating interfaces. Hopefully the update today will allow me to watch downloaded videos while offline this time as I‚Äôm flying again. | I purchase amazon prime so don't think I should have to pay extra for any shows other than rentrals.  Also, other channels seem to have a better selection of movies and shows to watch.  
May not pay next year. | Not only is this the worst functioning streaming app among ALL major players, but now even prime produced content is ad based now.  Seriously y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know your upcoming paying market. | The ads are overwhelming! You fast forward more than 20 seconds it gives you over a minute in ads. You rewind more than 20 seconds another minute in ads. There is just as many ads as video playing. The ads are very frustrating. I don‚Äôt like them when paying for a subscription, but a few throughout are okay. This is very annoying being bombarded with ads. | I can watch almost everything on my tv with my prime subscription but i cannot on my iphone. Does anyone know why? | This is for the iPhone and Apple TV app. The iPhone app says it cannot find a device to cast to and the Apple TV app just shows a black screen when trying to watch videos. Amazon is just a terrible company and their app is terrible too. | Ugh | Ads on a paid service is ridiculous. | How do I go ad free? Each time I try, the app shuts down. | Fix the streaming capability when using an apple lightning to hdmi converter. App used to work with it but after an update it wont. No point in paying for prime if it‚Äôs useless | The app never wants to open. Once it does it's always so slow. If you ever get to a screen to watch a show it basically closes again. This is a trash app. | Prime platform continues to fail year after year. Every time I come back for these one-off occasions I hope it‚Äôs better, but it‚Äôs sooo slow and glitchy. Makes me sad, scared, and angry. #doubleprime #justdobetter #SSA | And doesn‚Äôt remember where you were in an episode most of the time. | It is a amazing app I can watch all the movies I want I highly suggest it | I really liked prime video until they started doing advertising commercials. It really distracts from the program as it happens randomly. | Absolutely INFURIATING that you cancelled watch parties! That was how my partner and I watched things together when he was away for work, which is half the week. Bring them back or I‚Äôm cancelling my Prime membership! | Why do I have ads when I pay for the subscription‚Ä¶ | I like the content but I don't like that the apps don't seem to connect.  For instance, since I watch through the firestick I wish I could just select whenever I see some thing I like. But when I see a tv/movie advertised I click on it because I know I may have that account service and it tells me I have to sign up, instead I have to go directly to that app to watch whatever it is. If you advertise it I should be easy to select when you see it not have to log in on a seperate app why not sink automaticly. | Prime video was mediocre to begin with, and now most of the shows force you to watch ads, so it‚Äôs become worse. | This is such a slime move. I‚Äôve been a member since 2015 and had no issue with the platform. But this I won‚Äôt stand for. Now you want me to pay more so I get rid of ads when the whole purpose of streaming platforms was TO NOT have ads. What‚Äôs next? paying extra to remove even more ads after that. Greedy. It‚Äôs never going to stop. Increase in membership and the increase to remove ads. In the long run it be cheaper for me to buy and own physical copy‚Äôs of TV shows and Movies. | You pay subscription and watch ads, dipricating current plan instead of adding a new one.

I‚Äôm really agitated about this. | There are so many annoying adds and I can‚Äôt watch anything without it bugging me | Love this app great story lines | The short stories they have in this app are interesting and addicting you just wanna know what happens next. | Love the storyline | Great stories I‚Äôm hooked | I really like this app they have Great stories they have a lot of dramas I like | Amazing app! I love the shorts! | All of the dramas are very good to watch..very exciting and intense. | I ducking hate this app why do we need to pay to watch something I hope u get hit in the head by a beerBottle | I love the story very interesting. Can‚Äôt wait to see how it ends | The main character is really great! 
The story was really great. The only thing is the ending. It‚Äôs was a rush and and short, not well put together. 

But over all the main actors are great especially Grace /Zoe | Loving this app! | Always something interesting! | Highly recommended to watch | Very reliable | Great app! | This app is awesome! | Great shows I love them all | I love it | I really enjoy the stories they are not the long. I just wish the one that are in Chinese/Vietnamese that they came in English gotta keep up with subtitles but for the most part I am so happy to be watching them. | Good novels | I have really enjoyed the stories | I love the shows, but it‚Äôs unfortunate that they don‚Äôt give you enough points to watch at least five episodes a day | I love these stroys and drams my favorite | Absolutely luv it and can not get enough of it very good | I love this drama to much twisted line and great movie. I give it a 5 star rating. | A fun way to take a mental break. | I love the stories and the amount of opportunity for earned coins. I would like for the skits to be longer. If they were a bit longer I probably would spend some money for coins. I look at it like I can see a whole movie at the theater for $13 but I‚Äôll only see a few minutes of this show for the same price. | Amazing app | great episodes highly recommend 10/10 my kids even enjoy these mobo reels and the prices for the coins are worth it you get to watch a lot of episodes with the coins plus you can watch ads to unlock for free download moboreels today!!!!!! | All that I have watched have been really great! | Love the plots and good actors | I love all the shows available and wish I could watch them all in one night, but I unfortunately work two jobs, so it‚Äôs difficult remembering to watch anything to be honest. But when I do have time, I always use this app for its Chinese drama. It‚Äôs more funny and entertaining than the American ones in my opinion. | The stories get you hooked but the whole watching ads for coins feels like such a scam.  3/5 times, I don‚Äôt get credit for the ad because it glitches and gets stuck.   I would pay for coins if the price was reasonable but it‚Äôs outrageous. I can just watch Netflix. | Great app! But you get caught up you have to buy coins cause it to short | Too much to give | Can‚Äôt wait to watch more | this app is so entertaining the shows are great i love it it‚Äôs super easy to get coins and there‚Äôs a lot to choose from i love it | this app has such good dramas! | Great story lines just wish you could watch more at a time. | I really like all the short stories here I am addicted | Love watching these they are addicting | You won‚Äôt regret to watch. It‚Äôs worth it of your time and your boredom. You just earn free coins to watch or pay reasonable price. Only 20$ a week of subscription with unlimited! | I love the story lines and plot twists. The best part about it is that it is not drawn out for a long time. | fun and good | Great app | Love this App it gets me through my long work shifts and keeps me wanting to watch more | Can I save a series to re-watch later since I‚Äôve already paid dearly for it? If I liked a Series I should be able to watch it again or as often with out paying more money.   I like to rewatch and some of the story lines are good, I would to watch them over.

1064216828,"com.reddit.Reddit","Reddit","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828?uo=4","Welcome to Reddit, the heart of the internet.

Reddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities and comment threads.

Redditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You‚Äôll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.

Reddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:
‚Ä¢ r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions
‚Ä¢ r/funny, which is full of humorous content
‚Ä¢ r/science, for scientific discussions and news
‚Ä¢ r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure

On Reddit you‚Äôll find:
‚Ä¢ Thousands of community groups
Breaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.

‚Ä¢ Loads of laughs
Find memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.

‚Ä¢ AMAs, or ""Ask Me Anything""
Celebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.

‚Ä¢ The best discussions on any topic
Reddit‚Äôs discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice.

‚Ä¢ Get answers to anonymous questions 
Ask communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.

‚Ä¢ Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU
Connect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups or threads, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.

Voting and Karma:

Instead of likes and hearts, Reddit‚Äôs social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator‚Äôs karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.

While karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts‚Äô visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.

Reddit Premium:

Purchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.

Payment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device‚Äôs Account Settings. No partial refunds.

We've updated our iOS app with bug fixes and changes to improve your overall experience.","2024.17.0",0,"USD",true,808295587,"reddit","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/reddit/id808295587?uo=4","https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download",4.7637,"Get my news off here | 55555 | Fire the update team because they made it virtually impossible to read posts now without constant pop-up messages pertaining to this or that, and I‚Äôm constantly being brought back to the Apple Store to download the app, which I already downloaded. Pretty frustrating. I was never a heavy Reddit user anyway but this last update just may be the catalyst to cause me to say goodbye to this service for good. | Overall, content is good but too much is arbitrary. You can be prohibited or banned from one subreddit for simply commenting in or joining another. Moderation is also extremely arbitrary, and varies heavily from subreddit to subreddit. Navigating such content can be difficult at times if you choose to engage with others. | Disgusting how they just delete honest reviews of a decrepit and dying platform that has nearly zero resemblance to the original founders‚Äô creation and intentions. | I really wish I could do quotations and italicize like I do on the website without having to use html code and such. It really detracts from the experience. | Great program except for the mods, they‚Äôll listen to a random person making false accusations to get their way, and be unable to provide evidence of any wrong doing by you. Then when that upsets you, they‚Äôll mute you so can‚Äôt complain. | I‚Äôm usually not wanting to take part in social media however Reddit is kind of my exception. I know in the past Reddit has gotten a bad for where all the weird people hang out and all that. But honestly, I‚Äôm my about two years on Reddit I‚Äôve learned that there are definitely both kinds of people on this app. it‚Äôs interesting to see because you can join any community you want and usually people are willing to help and give insight you wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise. The app is extremely user-friendly and allows for lots of customization. if you are a maker of any sorts or if you have a 3-D printer or honestly just wanna see cool stuff this is definitely the app for you. You could have all the best elements of social media leaving out the worst ones. if you‚Äôre still on the fence, just give it a try and if you don‚Äôt like it, then you can delete it. | Can‚Äôt view the post when opening up comment replies anymore. Too many ads. | Reporting an ad for unwanted violence or sexual themes doesn‚Äôt remove them from my feed. This is awful. | You will get banned over the most petty of things. Admins don‚Äôt care if mods harass you, bully you, or invade your privacy. The admins only care about making pennies for each click and crappy ad. Avoid this site at all costs. Reddit has begun to destroy itself and it‚Äôs become nothing more than a cash grab for admins and a power trip for the mods. | When you send a link to someone it does not open the app and the website won‚Äôt display ‚Äúmature‚Äù content. Worthless. | I can't go 5 seconds without Reddit it's amazing | Every update makes the app worse. Now after each time you swipe, the engagement dash pops up when it didn‚Äôt use to. (I mean the upvote downvote comment etc). Ultra distracting and trying to farm mass engagement across the platform. Very small, but perfect encapsulation of every update | I like being able to see all the pictures of different kinds animals, taken by ordinary people, not in a professional Studio. I like being able to say what I think about about what I see
Good or bad. | Whenever I go into the app it mutes my music. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are looking at the front page or reading a text only post or looking at a media post. I tried disabling and enabling auto play and media muting and nothing fixed it. I can‚Äôt even unpause it from control center because closing the control center pauses the music again. The only way around this it to open Reddit and then use a watch to hit play (or use headphones to hit play if you are using them). Please fix this. | I love to scroll on Reddit whenever I‚Äôm waiting for something or have a little downtime. Unfortunately, this app makes using the general functions of Reddit nearly impossible. Rather than trying to change the design of the app and appearances, please fix the MAJOR bugs. Each update causes new bugs - not sure what bugs they‚Äôre claiming to fix when they just cause more. | Call out Israel harshly, get banned.

I‚Äôll see you all behind the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster | Hate the ceo | Then they decided to muck with the app, so it no longer works as well as it did THREE years ago.

Such a disappointment of a company. Niantic light. | Q | When I open a post the caption is automatically hidden, so I have to scroll up to find it. Why wouldn‚Äôt someone want to read the caption on a post they clicked? There‚Äôs no reason for that. Also, if I open a post with pictures and scroll to the end, it now sends me to a new post. Sometimes, it sends me to communities I‚Äôm not even apart of. Both this issues are nothing but inconveniences. | Reddit is depressing. My account got hacked for being a Jew. Now I‚Äôm just going directly report things the ADL instead of Reddit. | I usually dont write reviews but I feel this one is justified. The fact I have to download this app to view certain posts/threads is insane. Would give 0 stars out of principal if possible. | Absolute trash full of bots and fakes glad your stock is tanking | Looks like the mos recent update is making the navigation awful. Whenever a post is opened, the app jumps directly to the comments instead of showing up the original post content. You need to scroll up to know what the conversation is about. | Reddit happens to be the most prevalent forum site so I‚Äôm inclined to use it, but the ownership and upper management is dog water and make decisions based around their bottom line and stockholders rather than the end-user (shocking).

Also it‚Äôs always a buggy mess, be it the web browser or the app. Again, the only redeeming quality is its prevalence. | Constantly dealing with stupid bugs like not being able to view posts or comments. Sometimes buttons won‚Äôt work, or audio won‚Äôt work. This app constantly presents its multitude of bugs, and it makes me really miss the Apollo app. | What a joke. I have used reddit for a long time. I work 60 hours a week and comment here and there. I was put up in the hospital and now bed rest and on reddit more to distract myself from the pain. I go on after a short nap to find I have had an IP ban. I know I have done nothing untoward to warrant something so aggressive. I can‚Äôt even open reddit to find out how to negate it. Found someone giving an email for appeals on Quora. Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt worth it. I shouldn‚Äôt have to jump through hoops like that. I‚Äôm just deleting the app and my account if it would let me.  It‚Äôs even more ridiculous that now I can‚Äôt access my NFT‚Äôs. I feel that counts as theft? I‚Äôll probably make a lot of noise about my NFTs once I‚Äôm off bedrest.  There should be something better than this. Reddit is a failure. | App not loading | Too many crashes. Doesn‚Äôt load even when connected to the internet and all other apps are working fine. Disgusting! Bring back Apollo! | This app was not made for iOS‚Ä¶. Constantly crashing or unable to access. | Hello,
Over the past two weeks, I have been trying to to utilize the Reddit app on my iPhone. But nothing loads and I receive the little dead figure showing that there is an error. I can‚Äôt even see my messages or my profile. I noticed that on my computer I am able to access Reddit. May I please have assistance with this?  I tried submitting a report on the Reddit site but I am not provided the option to. | For some reason I can no longer downvote some post. The only option is up vote. If you try and downvote a post that is pro hamas for example it turns blue and then says unable to downvote then erases your vote. | Reddit is not responsible and it keeps saying that the server is error. It won‚Äôt let me into my account no matter how many times I uninstall and reinstall the app. | This latest Reddit update (4/25/2024) is absolutely awful. So many bugs. Did you guys even test it before you published it? Whoever approved this needs to be fired. | Why Reddit. Why are you incapable of just opening the app? Why is it every time I attempt to click on a link, you refuse to allow it to open‚Ä¶redirect to the App Store, and then the page is lost. 

Zero stars. Worthless. | The app continues to be borderline unusable. You MUST have a perfect internet connection to use the chat feature with any functionality. The ads continue to pile up as well, terrible experience. | Reddit is a failed app. Their mods have too much power. If you got banned on one thing for having just a slightly different opinion as someone then they will ban you on many different subreddits that you‚Äôve never even commented on before just to have fun messing around with you. This has been my experience. Infuriating to say the least. But I‚Äôm confident that if they keep this up it will eventually come back to bite them. | I try to google the query with the words ‚Äúreddit‚Äù at the end of the search term. This shows me conversations abt the problem im looking into. Very useful. 

If only the app was more stable to browse and interact with. Feels unresponsive at times. Videos lag and crash app often | Update 04.25.24 - still no fix for swiping media issue

Update 04.17.24 More bugs: Same issues as before, but the swiping media right to see more content isn‚Äôt working again. It just keeps showing the next suggestion even when on a persons profile. Update 04.17.24 More bugs: I‚Äôm getting reply notifications, but the link to them in the post won‚Äôt load. I have internet and the post loads for a couple notifications but most them don‚Äôt. Maybe they don‚Äôt exist anymore due to them being flagged or deleted? It still won‚Äôt save to custom lists and accessing the lists is hard because keeps being moved or is missing entirely. After liking or saving/tagging a post, these interactions just disappear randomly. Search Update: Search seems to be working better. Search options are the most garbage in the industry. Have to google your search to find what you‚Äôre looking for. Subs are hard to find for no reason even if you know the name of the sub. | Won‚Äôt let me deactivate my account or delete the stupid app I don‚Äôt use anyways!! I stil get notifications logged out and the app deleted from my home screen! Want rid of it !! | Devs there‚Äôs a bug in code 1Ce-72 custom configure it to a line instead of HTML‚Ä¶ wait. Hire me instead. All jokes aside one of the few apps left that has a community majority ran by non NPC‚Äôs. So started using it in traffic mostly | App is not compatible with the iPhone keyboard. So often I I‚Äôm writing a comment and maybe need to fix a typo a few words back or rewrite something. So I press to highlight a word, move the cursor, or select something to make it a link‚Ä¶ nope the app glitches out and the text box freezes so I can‚Äôt post or something swipes the wrong way and I can‚Äôt see what I wrote anymore. If I try to back out of the thread and the ‚Äúdiscard comment?‚Äù prompt appears even though my text box is nowhere to be found. So I‚Äôve lost the whole thing I‚Äôve written. This happens CONSTANTLY to the point of rage quitting the app after spending lots of time typing out thoughts for it all to just disappear! | The creator supports Palestine poo poo app | may be my phone but the app is pretty laggy and takes some time to load hopefully that can be fixed soon, nice app tho. | I try to reply to a comment, hit the reply button and the button won‚Äôt do it. | In a general opinion of the app, Reddit, I have nothing but good things to say! The many discussions on varying topics from nascar to Asian heritage, or even food porn, have all been meticulously debated upon and Reddit seems to be the app where anyone can look for and find answers or solutions to anything, as well as lend advice to others and potentially promote ones self or business. 

My only issue (with Reddit), is the inability of Reddit as a corporation to enforce and try to drive off negative internet traffic!( trackers, scammers, perverts, money launderers, etc the list goes on but I think they need to crack down on the amount of fake profiles and make every single user do an id verification | I have been using Reddit for a minute now it it been working really good until the latest new update/ version .

I still use it in the hopes it might go back to personal experiences, blogs, stories, projects and really cool ideas but for now I‚Äôm not able to get much use from it. 3 years ago I would have given it 5 stars. I suspect it‚Äôs average of 4.9 stars is because the old reviews are averaged in. Most recent users reviews are expressing the same sentiment.

I love this app! I wish they would go back to showing unique photos for each post under the category you search for, rather than the posts all being similar website blogs. In that manner, Pinterest has went down hill in the variety of information and inspiration it offers.

On a separate note, I wanted to say how happy I am with the new body type tool when searching in fashion. It‚Äôs so nice to see inclusion of all body types from both far ends of the spectrum. I also appreciate the order in which the options are listed. It boosts body positivity in a world where women are under so much scrutiny.

Now it‚Äôs rampant with AI art, ads, and distracting videos like every other app. | Pinterest has helped me draw incredible Stuff and if Pinterest wasn‚Äôt here I would not have any experiment in drawing. So thank you so much for this inspiring app‚ò∫Ô∏è. | I have been using Pinterest since the very beginning and used to love it. Now there are more ads than regular pins. At least 70% of my feed is sponsored posts, usually repetitive ones. I understand ads are needed for revenue but it has gotten ridiculous.

It‚Äôs been like this for weeks for me. I‚Äôve deleted it and reinstalled. I‚Äôve updated it. But still, I can‚Äôt use it. Not really sure what to do at this point. | You click on a link and all that happens is an image search comes up. You can‚Äôt even click on a link to read the post. It‚Äôs unusable. | If had was only rating on the idea and usefulness of this app, it would immediately be 5 stars. I love this app, I love everything you can do with it. It‚Äôs so good for categorizing your thoughts and ideas on different topics. The reason i put 3 and not 5 stars is because the app is SO insanely buggy. I mean glitches every 5 minutes. Sometimes the app crashes, sometimes it‚Äôll freeze while I‚Äôm scrolling, sometimes when I go to delete a pin, it won‚Äôt ex out of the edit pin screen. Every time I open the app I can guarantee it‚Äôll do something. It‚Äôs honestly infuriating. I have to literally clear out of the app and retrace my steps every 5 minutes! How is anyone supposed to get anything done doing that. I run MUCH heavier apps that don‚Äôt glitch anywhere near what Pinterest does. Please God fix the glitches so I can actually enjoy this app and not want to throw my phone | Best app ever. Girls don‚Äôt try googling cute wallpapers or homemade cookies on the internet. Go on Pinterest!!! Way better and accurate results of anything ur looking for ;) | This app is a such a fun app for 12 year olds and up! It‚Äôs engaging and has a free realm to create and use your imagination! I truly love this app! | This has been an issue for years, but it has gotten worse recently: if you pin something within one category too many times, that is all Pinterest will ever show you. Pin a few pins about My hero Academia, then search for Father‚Äôs Day gift ideas, and the results will be one item related to your search and ten results related to My Hero Academia, no matter what you search for. My specific results are showing Welcome Home fanart no matter what I search for, which is so, so creepy. But mostly extremely irritating and unhelpful. The app is almost unusable. | I‚Äôve never been so enraged. The search feature seems to be vehemently refusing to work properly. I‚Äôll look up ‚Äúaesthetic white blouse‚Äù and be shown completely different results when I normally receive very lovelypins aligning  with what I am actually seeking. My entire, perfectly curated feed has seemed to be ruined as well. Completely out of no where. I am still signed in and I‚Äôve done nothing for this to have happened, this is quite possibly the worst timing as I am trying to do character creation at this moment. I am literally weeping on my floor right now, crying screaming and sobbing, shaking my fists at the air. | It keeps showing me pins that have nothing to do with my search!! | I‚Äôve used pinterest for almost a decade now and loved the website and used to love the app. But now i cant view 3 pins without the 4th being promoted. Its all promoted content. Pinterest is choosing money over quality and its sad. | The app freezes regularly‚Ä¶ | As a long time pinterest user and a Health At Every Size/ body neutrality advocate and nutrition student, this update means the world to me. It‚Äôs another small step to help folks in every body size use the app in a way that‚Äôs empowering and relevant to them. :) big dub Pinterest | Too many ads. It‚Äôs excessive at this point and don‚Äôt enjoy scrolling. No, I‚Äôm not interested in paying to get ads removed. | This app is a good at it help me find ideas and cute things ü´∂üèª | I‚Äôve used every ema I can my apple one my google one but it just won‚Äôt let me sign in. It keeps saying I‚Äôm not eligible. It very irritating, so if you could pleas fixes this I would be sooooo happy so I can finally use Pinterest | I‚Äôve been using Pinterest for well over 10 years. Recently the app won‚Äôt show pictures anymore. I just see colored blocks and words. I‚Äôve checked for updates. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs wrong with it but its all I see now when I open it up. I‚Äôll scroll and the only pics I see are ads.

No help anywhere on how to fix it. | My phone was hacked. My name is JACKIEGALLO birthdate 08/15/1980 | I love this app- in fact depending on the person I use this to chat more than regular text message- but the one thing that I hate the most is the ‚Äúfalse/ghost notification‚Äù on Facebook that says I have a message- I go to said message in messenger and have nothing-no where! not even in ‚Äúchat requests‚Äù I would love this issue permanently fixed. | Why can‚Äôt I use the GIF Keyboard directly to the person I‚Äôm sending a message to in Messenger anymore. Is it possible to link the GIF KEYBOARD the way it was before this recent change? Thank you for your help. | T·∫°i sao mess tui kh√¥ng c√≥ ghi ch√∫? | To the review I read complaining about hackers, you are doing something wrong if you keep getting ‚Äúhacked‚Äù, stop putting all the blame on Facebook. Don‚Äôt click on random links, use unique passwords (and a password manager; they‚Äôre much more secure than using the same simple password for all your accounts), and the best thing you can do is turn on 2 factor authentication. It can be a bit of an annoyance, but if you‚Äôre having as many problems as you are (and even if you aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs still just a good idea), it‚Äôs worth the trouble.

I don‚Äôt even like Facebook that much and only use it for marketplace (wish this could be a separate thing, connected to your account but it‚Äôs own standalone messaging system/app.. cuz I want to sell/buy stuff but not necessarily always interact with people I know), but i read a review of some person acting like their accounts being ‚Äúhacked‚Äù was all Facebook‚Äôs fault and not due to their own actions at all‚Ä¶ and while technically possible, I‚Äôd wager it could probably be avoided completely by making just a couple changes on how you do things on the Internet. | You guys are all  entertaining what is your background what do you do can I get involved with your business ? | I login to stuff nonstop. Why do I have create a new PIN code when I don‚Äôt want to ? | Allows users to create new profiles under another persons name to scam people and destroy lived | We just can chat a little bit  then is say  block or delete or accept  I tap accept is Doesn‚Äôt accept | Bring back the call history tab. No one wanted AI | Extreme stutters and lag on iPhone 15 Pro and iPad Pro (latest) when scrolling through a conversation. Very unpleasant. I didn‚Äôt buy a fast phone to have facebook messenger make it feel slow. My friends and I are changing to another chat app. Good bye. | I send a message, it goes to the recipient, then says on both of our ends that I sent a message but we need to update the app. Updates the app, same message. Ridiculous. | Since Meta AI has been added you can‚Äôt see your friends that are online I wouldn‚Äôt give 1 star | Why do I have to update every single time I open the account to see a message? | Thank you for continuing to provide updates to order iOS versions, can you please tell the Facebook team to do the same and release a few updates to fix unresolved issues. 
Thanks. | Please change messenger back to how you received notifications. It was working fine before you changed it. 

PLEASE PUT PINNED MESSAGES BACK. I lost important messages, because someone decided to get rid of it. And you got rid of something that actually worked. | I also get messages from people I‚Äôm friends with.
Hackers are ruining this app and I can only stand it so much | i get messages from scammers on here through an app called meta i hate it all together i‚Äôll keep trying to delete it and it still keeps coming back please get rid of it or i‚Äôll let my friends and family so they can delete facebook and messages also | Amare | Quit changing stuff.  Your so called techs messing things up. Cant pay or send money via messenger.  Fix now!!!! | Not seeing messages. Says to update, I did and still no messages. Stop messing with it!!! | bring back the call log on the bottom instead of ask meta no one gives a care about meta | I constantly have a notification on Facebook that I have an unopened or unanswered message yet when I go to messenger it doesn‚Äôt show any unanswered messages. This is getting ridiculous. Fix your app. | I don‚Äôt want a pin or a password, I purposely downloaded you so I WOULDNT HAVE TO DO THAT. Please!! Make it an option to not have to do that. | There are several functionality, still lacking in efficiency. For example,

- Deleting Option not immediately available, has to hit ‚Äòmore‚Äô first
- the texting window is very very small, have to scroll up to see what you typed. | R·∫•t tuy·ªát | I am not being forced to have a pin or whatever for my messages | After things working well for a while, the latest update has been junk. It keeps telling my I need to update the app (which I have) to see messages or message previews.

Bring back the search bar.  I do not want to ‚ÄúAsk AI ANYTHING‚Äù. | We shall rectify this wrong, and pin our messages as we have since then! | Idk if it‚Äôs their new encryption or whatever but the app has become total garbage. | It is invasive and interrupting of the experience, and for no reason | It wanted me to update the App, so I did. Now it will not let me open any new messages. I even restarted my phone. What is up with this mess?! | Used to be good, now it is garbage. Syncing doesn‚Äôt always work. This week I had to -resync 8-9 times. All the images and videos that are shared are not saved, so if I want to find them, I have to scroll through the chat, and that can take hours looking for ones that were months old. This app is complete trash. | Why we can‚Äôt see the delivered status in iOS? We want to know if our message is delivered or not like the Android. We don‚Äôt want only the sent status. | This app is getting worse and complicated in short its unfriendly user app because of too much restriction unlike the old one. | The update from 4 hours ago STOPS just as it gets to the end. Does not complete. Are you aware of this?? | Can‚Äôt see those people that‚Äôs online anymore what‚Äôs going on | Every week is a bit much to update.

You‚Äôd think one of the richest companies in the world could afford to at least have a working app. But this is probably made in a sweat shop too | It needs a longer time for you to say what you are looking for. It does not recognize my voice. | Shopper doesn't seem to pick the best produce.  I've received limp lettuce, brown celery, etc. | Love it | Great tasting bar | What is the point of scan and go if an associate has to scan my items in the line what a waste of time | Prices are so high it‚Äôs unbelievable. | I have just recently started using the curbside pickup service and app. Where have you been all my life?üôÇThanks Walmart! If you‚Äôve never tried this .. just do it.. you‚Äôll be glad you did! | The app kept telling me my Visa card was expired. WRONG, the card expires on 10/24.
Had to use another card. | Little difficult to make a quick delivery order | Great service and prices | This app is so convenient and easy to use. Five star rating from me! | I placed my first order on this app. And it arrived very quickly, but three products were needed, and they said I had to wait up to seven days for them to arrive at my house. I waited the 7 days and I get that one of the products was already delivered of the three products I was waiting for, but Upon leaving. to check at my door, the order was not there, I tried to contact Walmart and they tell me that I must wait two more days to be able to solve my problem and I call support so they can talk to me and they always answer me, they are pure machines, the truth is, I had a bad experience, I do not recommend this application since it is possible that the delivery people may be stealing your products by saying that they delivered it and they do not do so. or the store isn't shipping them, I don't know. What is the problem? But if you really want a product you will have to go buy it yourself. | Love the app, it‚Äôs nice and modern looking with animations and stuff.

Only thing I‚Äôm missing is dark mode.

Cheers! | Very easy to navigate and do all functions online | Quick and easy saves time. | Update 4/24/24: Another update and the widgets are not working again. Original review: The app is alright, the biggest issue I have is with the widgets. I like using a widget for Walmart Pay and Scan & Go. The problem is widgets come and go with updates. I‚Äôve lost them at least twice in the last few months. They will update the app and completely remove them. Then, an update or two later, they‚Äôre back! It‚Äôs VERY annoying. Please put the widgets back and leave them alone! | I have been unable to use Walmart + to save money on Walmart gasoline | Easy to use. Cheaper then Amazon. But Temu has all of you beat as far as price, but doesn‚Äôt carry name/expensive brands. But Walmart is most people‚Äôs go to store. Even the wealthy. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre billionaires! | Ordering from Walmart online is fast and easy. Very convenient. | Shopping at the Streetsboro Walmart is always a breeze.  The Walmart Associates are always very courteous and calm about unloading the groceries, regardless of the weather.  I am a 100 % disabled Vietnam Veteran and have serious problems with lifting.  I certainly appreciate the courtesies extended to me by the Walmart Associates.  Their labors definitely do not go unnoticed by this elderly Veteran.  You all keep up your great work.  You get a resounding attaboy from me every time.  Thank you all ! | Too many steps to go through. Still have not been approved. | Walmart plus is wonderful for me because I don‚Äôt have to go anywhere. I love it, but I can‚Äôt find access to the free paramount plus tv. Need help with that. | I am so pleased to find such a nice variety at great prices every time. | I try to shop at smaller businesses but it‚Äôs SO EASY to just stop at one place and get everything I need! They have literally everything.‚Ä¶ I recently started ordering online to have some things shipped to home but I don‚Äôt mind wandering around and seeing new products. Love it! | I love dis app it‚Äôs fast an easy to use never disappoint me | Walmart 0981 is simply the best!  If what I need or want isn‚Äôt in stock, it will be restocked quickly!  Checkout is seamless, easy, and quick. | This app is garbage. It‚Äôs slow, it‚Äôs buggy, and it constantly gives me errors or tells me there‚Äôs a technical issue. The inventory system stinks! It always tells me it‚Äôs out of stuff that is clearly on the shelf at the store. I never have issues with Amazon or any other shopping app. I have the latest phone, and it‚Äôs still a rotten app. I hate it. | I‚Äôm happy with shopping online. It‚Äôs easy and fast. When I don‚Äôt have time to go out and buy groceries this is my go to. My only complaint is some delivery drivers don‚Äôt put my groceries where they‚Äôre suppose to go because I live in an apartment building so they‚Äôre lazy and I don‚Äôt like that. I also have problems with Walmart forgetting items. Even though they refund you, it‚Äôs still a headache because it‚Äôs stuff you wanted or needed. So it‚Äôs frustrating. Other than that this was a tremendously great idea!! | Always on time.
Generally, very polite and professional delivery personnel.
If there‚Äôs a problem, it is addressed immediately into my satisfaction.
Overall, I am very pleased with Walmart delivery service | Wasting my time figuring it out | Trying to place order and before even clicking place order I get text notifications on my phone that charge made on card but app shows order not placed yet. After looking at purchase history order is not showing and cart still has items. Why are two identical holds being placed? | Great Service everytime I order they are on time. I recommend there delivery service and promptness. | Don‚Äôt like the idea that it doesn‚Äôt give you an option if you want to save or not save credit card information not satisfied because of that | I am not in your delivery area according to you even though I have Walmart+, yet, I see the truck go up my street almost daily and I get items delivered by you when the store doesn‚Äôt have them in stock. 
I save things to my items and when I bring up my items, you mix in other items that I haven‚Äôt saved, which defeats the purpose of my ‚Äòsaved items‚Äô!! | I‚Äôm tired of over priced food. | Thank you for providing delivery and shipping services. I find your box store overwhelming‚Ä¶ people, high stacked items, crowded isles, NEVER üëéüèæ a CHECK OUT ATTENDANT‚Ä¶ or one ( uno) over worked, underpaid workers who DESERVE much more than the WALTONS ( three of top 5 richest Americans) WOW ü§© Nickels and dines to quell the masses. Thank you üòä | I was very convenient to purchase this wheelchair on the WalMart app. | Was very easy to use the app thank you | This app worked fine until about 2 months ago. Now every time I log on I get a black screen with a red dot telling me to calibrate. Calibrate WHAT???
 It happens every time I try to get a description on an item, change the item I want to look at, or go back to a previous page. Getting really tired of it. 
I have updated the app and my tablet. | The checkout system is horrendous, aggravating, irritating, etc. When having to put in your EBT pin number, a grid comes up with the numbers and no particular checking out order. So it is like trying to find Waldo. When I was on the computer trying to do an order it kept coming up that my reserve time had expired when I had just picked the time. This went back-and-forth to the point I was ready to scream. So I went on my phone to try to finish up the order which I finally did. I am not a happy camper. 
The other thing is the fact when you are looking through what you‚Äôre trying to search for and you click on it, read about it and then go back, but it goes right back to the top of the beginning where you start it not where you were when you clicked on the item to check it out. Annoying and exasperating. | I love the next day shipping. I get to save so much time and money on the go! | Me encanta comprar por Walmart online por su precio y ofertas. | Shame on every company like Walmart that supports the genocidal regime of apartheid and ethnic cleansing of Israel | From the comfort of my home I do all my ordering. I love it | I made an order yesterday, 4/24/25. I never could go back to add anything and I couldn‚Äôt go in to check substitutions. 
Went to pick up my order today and the app wouldn‚Äôt open so I could check in. | Walmart has the best online service! | I use the app frequently to find stuff in the store. But be careful of the new ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. When you scan the UPC to find the price, it gives the online price not the in store price. I learned the hard way. A bag of grass seed scanned at $56 but at checkout it scanned at $78, a 40% increase.  It is clearly intentional and clearly unethical. | Hard to erase orders

Odd my PayPal was attached to this app without my permission. I am on a business trip and wanted to pay with company credit card. As soon as I placed order there was no way to review payment method or change it. Had to investigate from my email and bank account to determine it was indeed PayPal.  Weird you guys bury the payment info. Likely deleting this app. | Wow I got really annoyed with door dash and decided to try Uber eats instead. You know that saying out of the frying pan and into the fire? Well that really applies here and I‚Äôm done, only time Uber is going to get my business now is when I‚Äôm hammered and can‚Äôt get a cab. | You can place and order the driver can pick up your food. And while the driver has your food, the will send driver to pick up another order. And then have that driver deliver that person food first. While your food was picked up first and now sitting getting cold . and they push the delivery time back further, I stop leaving tips when they do that | I‚Äôm deleting the app. I keep getting discount promo codes  that aren‚Äôt accepted from them. From now on I‚Äôll report their emails as spam. | I never received my order and never received a refund. Use doordash | Bad experience using this app. Drivers get lost and just leave food at wrong addresses constantly without calling. Food is usually cold and anything frozen is melted by the time it arrives. Customer service won‚Äôt help either, it‚Äôs a run around. | Hoy se cobr√≥    Sin pedir  nada de  pedido | DONT NEVER EVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP. I ordered food for my friend in the past and I ordered food for myself and I forgot to change the address I asked them if I could get a refund or credits or anything to help me get my food back they said no and ended the conversation | Or at least give me a way to turn them off. This is against Apples App Store policy. M | Wouldn‚Äôt recommend they don‚Äôt like to give money back if missing items & someone took my whole $30 order & Uber eats won‚Äôt refund & I also pay for Uber one so it‚Äôs a scam USE DOORDASH | They make it so easy to have a year membership for free and if you don‚Äôt cancel, it starts charging you. The problem is you can‚Äôt find a way to cancel your membership. It sounds very simple but reality I can‚Äôt find it in the app. Lesson learned don‚Äôt ever except free anything because nothing is free. | I buy food. Food take long. Money gone no food üò™ order not coming üò™ uder give refund. Money back. All cool üòéüëç | This app is the worst of all food delivery ive used. The promo codes dont worm half the time. When contacting support some email guy just dont read the messages you send and rushes to close the conversation | I hope you all go out of business for your disgusting awfulness | Terrible customer service, insane prices, will take your money without even notifying you, terrible in all aspects honestly. Will no longer be using Uber Eats. | I placed an order. I changed my mind and wanted something different. So I canceled the order and made a new one. I was charged for both orders. The delivery person asked me did I place the first order? I said yes. Because I changed my mind about what I wanted to eat. He said he thought so because my address came up on the website and then disappeared. So I‚Äôm not pleased with Uber eats until I get my money back for the first order. Sincerely a disappointed customer.  ü•≤ | Uber isn‚Äôt profitable without insane prices and scamming it‚Äôs workers, every item in Uber is more expensive then in store, but that‚Äôs okay right? It‚Äôs a third or double the amount now and still you pay for fees and delivery plus tips. Expect your total to be doubled compared to buying in store. Don‚Äôt use, unless you‚Äôre insanely rich and lazy. Or helpless and immobile. | It's the worst food delivery app ever used. Believe me, I have used a dozen of such apps in multiple countries. | I‚Äôve ordered through here multiple times and this my thoughts their customer service is horrible when I contact them to let them know I‚Äôm missing items or something‚Äôs wrong and all I get is we‚Äôre sorry to hear that we try to give excellent service but unfortunately I can‚Äôt offer you a refund I didn‚Äôt even ask for one. They couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to get in touch with the restaurant about it just basically oh well. So I won‚Äôt order through them again. I wish Lyft had a food delivery service because they are better that‚Äôs why I only ride with Lyft. | Every couple of years I try this app. I order and am delighted to see a 15-25 minute promised delivery time. Each time after an hour and several calls and several tranquilizers I am still waiting with no possibility of getting a refund and realizing that there‚Äôs nothing I can do but wait for my cold food to arrive. I‚Äôm an idiot with a terrible memory. | Refused to refund $35 for food that was never delivered | I‚Äôve been using Uber Eats for years, but I‚Äôve had recent quality problems. 

Most recently I paid $19 for a meal and there was barely anything in the container. After filing a complaint Uber told me to rate the restaurant, which offered no resolution to my payment. I then told them to cancel my membership if they cannot provide my refund back. Instead of offering an alternative solution, they canceled my membership.

Poor service especially when I‚Äôve spent thousands of dollars on this platform. Will not be giving them my money again. | We live 6 minutes out of town. Which means about a 9 minute drive. Uber knows our address and we have had many deliveries before. However, every once in awhile a driver sees ‚Äúhow far‚Äù we live and cancels our order because they say we are 20 miles away which is a lie. This last time we ordered we really needed the food. Our family was having a crisis and I wanted to order food for my wife so she didn‚Äôt have to cook. The driver lied and my wife had to cook. Shame on you Uber! Don‚Äôt let your drivers lie | Needs better communication for when the driver is lost. Also please get a widget | Ba service and no communication. A never get nay food and I din‚Äôt have my money back. | Multiple items missing from my order with extremely delayed responses from support. Only given $5 credit to my account to repurchase despite each item missing costing over $5. Barely covers tax and delivery fee. Terrible customer service. | Hadn‚Äôt used in ages. Priority order was 2/3 wrong and very expensive not to mention late. | I have had a few issues with terrible customer service but for the most part the app is solid. However, it is times like these where I question the validity of an app like this. I was trying to apply a promotion for selected restaurants where I would get 15% off. I cannot apply the promotion and there is also nowhere where I can try to contact customer service about this. Being someone that has paid for a subscription to the service it shouldn‚Äôt be this difficult. The waste of time over pointless issues and the lack of customer service has resulted in a 2 star rating. | They don‚Äôt let you talk they take your money they don‚Äôt care if you get your order they don‚Äôt care about what you‚Äôre talking about.  If they make a mistake, it‚Äôs going to cost. Customer service is the rudest most inconsiderate people I‚Äôve ever spoke to. | If there is a problem with an order the restaurants say they do not manage the app or menus. I‚Äôve ordered multiple times for several people and received half the items without notification, the excuse being the items weren‚Äôt available and the restaurants saying they don‚Äôt have those items. If I ordered for six and only received for three, what will the other three eat?  Refunding the three is not acceptable. | You have a promotion that cleary expires in a month? You will be entirely unable to apply it and there will be no clear reason why. Better yet, the joke of uber's outsourced customer service (if you can even reach them) will absolutely not help you in the slightest. This app is not only more expensive than doordash, its just worse overall. | To be honest. Ive had my fair share of issues. So unfortunately i will no longer be using this service. Longer than expected wait times. Missing items. Cold food. Cant select certain places nearby. It always recommends places far away so they can charge high service fee and high delivery fee. My 16 dollar meal costed me almost 50. | is so bad i dont even wanna write why doordash is way better | Get this app if you don‚Äôt want to ever receive your food. Door dash is 1000% better | Canceled order immediately and they say they started the order! A lieee they took my money | Uber eats is a scam, they‚Äôre so lazy that they just cancelled your order if ‚Äúthe driver had some issues‚Äù which in reality, YOUR DRIVER CANCELS IT CAUSE THEY‚ÄôRE GREEDY, and won‚Äôt give you your money back if your order was cancelled. Not only that they cost you more money than how much the food actually costs, the drivers are so lazy they just leave it at random peoples door and the good drivers aka the drivers who try their best are rarely picked. Who are picked are the bad drivers, if you want good online service when it comes to ordering your food DoorDash and Other food services are better, end of story buh bye | By and large I get good service. I love the notes space. Very convenient. I‚Äôd love a particular restaurant that‚Äôs on Uber to deliver to us. It‚Äôs in Hyde park and we get other deliveries from there. Thanks and keep it u | The worst customer service and problem resolution in the world. Absolutely dreadful.  Deleting profile and app.  Switching to another food delivery service that actually cares about its customers and their satisfaction for services rendered | They over charge your card | Menu prices are always 3-6 dollars more yet they still charge a 3 dollar delivery fee and a 6 dollar service fee. Just crazy how they can charge so much and still have more expensive menu prices than what the seller is actually listing if you go there. | This past time I submitted that both my drink and fries were missing from the order. I was missing 2/3 of my order. So I rated my order and submitted that I didn‚Äôt receive those things. About a week or two later still no reach out and no refund. So I went through the help center and explained a part of it. Well your service team responded said no refund and closed the ticket. No chance to write back and I can‚Äôt make any more claims about it and there‚Äôs no where else to contact any support. Your app support is absolutely terrible. Why can I not chat with someone real time? Why can I not call someone real time? So you know what, I canceled all of my Uber Apps because you guys essentially stole money from me when the drink is the drivers fault and the sweet potato fries is the restaurants fault. You really need to explain when you‚Äôre ‚Äúrating‚Äù the order that that‚Äôs not how you‚Äôre supposed to go about getting a refund. In fact rating makes 0 difference and does absolutely nothing because if the guy had maybe looked into my account he would‚Äôve seen that I did rate my order within 24 hours of the order arriving. I did it right then and there before I even ate the sandwich which was only 1/3 of my meal. So I won‚Äôt be going through Uber for anything anymore. I‚Äôm using Lyft for rides and other food delivery services from now on. You used to be my go to, I even worked with the company but you just stole money from me. | This app customer service is HORRIBLE!!!! If i could leave no stars i would. They have constantly told me that my food was delivered and i never received it or received part of the order or the food was soggy and inedible and was told i cannot get a refund. I was a member and they stole so much money from me i had to cancel my membership and delete the app. It‚Äôs sad to pay for something and be scammed by it. If you ever have any issues with your food not being deliver or the restaurant messing up your order good luck getting your money back. They don‚Äôt care and it‚Äôs sad. I‚Äôve even called because the people you chat with will only give you a response they would give anyone and they blocked me from getting my money back. This app is a scam and a waste of money to be honest. | The app stole money from me by cancelling MY order then saying I cancelled and that‚Äôs why I was was charged $30+. Terrible app! | I've ordered from this app many times, at first they will give you the refund when your order is messed up. However if you are unlucky and multiple orders of yours is messed up, they don‚Äôt help you. I made an order from shake shack and one of the burgers was missing and Uber Eats charged me for it. When I complained they also said that this order is not eligible for a refund. Customer supports English comprehension is questionable, and didn't allow me to get a refund for that missing item. | I had a order delivered late, missing more than half of my items and the safety seal broken yet received no help or refund except ‚Äúwe are sorry and will talk with the restaurant‚Äù. It was a bad situation that was made worse by the Uber customer service. Now that my ticket is ‚Äúclosed‚Äù I have no way of going back to try and get my money back from a meal that wasn‚Äôt delivered in full and that was tampered with. | My order included a $15 drink, which was not delivered. Multiple chats and talks on the phone have shown it‚Äôs seemingly impossible to get help. I was transferred three times on the phone, and the all three employees seemed to struggle with how to proceed. I went back to the chat, and that person had to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù my chat because they couldn‚Äôt help. This is not rocket science. I‚Äôve never encountered this many layers of incompetence. | When you try to call because of the amount of time or the driver is driving in circles or the order is wrong, there is no one to actually help. You are just left with the option to get your money back and starve or wait for your food starving. Doesn‚Äôt help. I really wish there where better options of delivery services | They made me wait TWO AND A HALF HOURS AND THEN CANCELLED MY ORDER!!!!! After ruining my entire night, they REFUSED TO EVEN GIVE ME ANY CREDIT FOR THIS!!!! NEVER USE THIS APP!!!!!!! Absolute crooks!!!! | The only reason I installed this app is our local restaurant is held hostage by these shady food delivery companies. | I used Uber eats today along with my promo. My total came up to 2.48 and I tipped 1.00 which made my total 3.48. I used 1.33 in Uber cash and the rest was charged to my account. After this order my account says that I owe 1.00, after look at the receipt and my bank statement it shows everything was paid in full, i reached out to customer twice the first representative IAN was rude, he cut the chat short while I was still confused. I chatted with another representative who was nice but could not resolve the issue and transferred me to someone else. I‚Äôve been using Uber for years and never had this problem. I‚Äôm disappointed because I am not being heard and this issue is not being resolved. I would suggest everyone to check their receipt and statement after each order in case you are over charged a 1.00 or anything. This is a hard time for me and I use Uber and Uber eats often and it saddens me that this is happening. It makes wonder how many other times have I been over charged.",4.77948,8011567,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/c5/b2/71/c5b27123-3cc2-15f0-b80e-b229d078bdbc/1b02e60f-48e9-4cb6-8836-b3faf1646b44_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_1242x2208_StepByStepRevamp_SS01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/59/8f/04/598f0453-99cf-9631-748f-31dd42d305f8/af248695-eabe-46f6-9f14-3582a38b7e72_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_1242x2208_StepByStepRevamp_SS02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/a5/e2/12/a5e21203-37b5-2503-5b39-1de2992729ac/8115953c-370f-4192-bd8b-4ef85c481e97_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_1242x2208_StepByStepRevamp_SS03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/38/17/2f/38172fd6-4513-5fa5-084b-60b6e372dea1/638d6914-b4a6-4060-914a-1ce5e73298c9_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_1242x2208_StepByStepRevamp_SS04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/51/5c/5f/515c5f88-eb84-7d83-c79c-e3155a2035de/015ff86f-96e9-4ea3-b63e-3c4b3ec9b88d_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_1242x2208_StepByStepRevamp_SS05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/35/6c/a8/356ca89b-c519-2463-aaf4-f4caab5c088b/c007b6bc-87f8-4b7b-8e06-052621533c48_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_1242x2208_StepByStepRevamp_SS06.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/24/e4/e6/24e4e64f-f717-4caa-9808-e5a5a16dfa01/798662e7-d35b-42f1-9ccb-1e4f046dbd27_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_2048x2732_StepByStepRevamp_SS01.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/ef/c4/9d/efc49d84-0ae9-4a8f-5c9b-7eae5f3906a0/d366f306-eac0-4ec2-80d7-0821a43c9e58_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_2048x2732_StepByStepRevamp_SS02.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/9e/a6/d2/9ea6d27c-3e27-a05a-2455-c67dd046773f/8033eb25-e496-47e4-a558-bb812d4de797_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_2048x2732_StepByStepRevamp_SS03.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/ac/55/d5/ac55d5d8-94a4-a748-f5d1-1cac71290f5b/a45945e6-8dbe-4f14-aaa2-9144d36fc343_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_2048x2732_StepByStepRevamp_SS04.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/47/2e/8c/472e8c6e-a59b-ff88-1068-9dbf962a4c1d/176199b7-13d1-4574-865d-1f0794e9e5a8_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_2048x2732_StepByStepRevamp_SS05.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/c2/6f/77/c26f7736-88bc-c334-4e15-37a2acb9fb30/4a76eecd-99fe-4f2d-997d-bc073cfd35ee_ASO1224_EATER_enUS_2048x2732_StepByStepRevamp_SS06.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAir

I‚Äôd highly recommend they go back to the old layout | Make the decoration to work on ur phone iPad any mobile it sets of pc or any laptops pls | The iPad apps seems to be getting neglected in terms of quality, weird gaps in the UX between the channel list and chat box, even in full screen mode. Would really like to see some improvements in this regard. | Discord is an amazing app and I use all the time to message my friends! I have Nitro Basic, and i really love my little custom emojis. There‚Äôs 2 things I would like to mention though that can be really frustrating for me pertaining to them. I don‚Äôt know if it was the last little bug fix discord had, but on the mobile app I noticed that when I click the emoji button and scroll down to my emoji list, the whole screen is filled with the emojis. This is a little hard to explain so bear with me üò≠. The emojis menu pops up and fills the screen, which makes it so I can‚Äôt see the messages being sent anymore and I can only see the emojis. The real problem I found though is when you click on any emoji, it just pops back down and I can‚Äôt click multiple of the same one at once. I sometimes like to spam my friends with emojis and this has made that a lot harder to do. When the menu goes back down after clicking one emoji, it isn‚Äôt even in the same spot either. So if I scroll to click an emoji and start spamming, when it goes back I end up spam clicking a different emoji altogether lol. That was a lot of explaining sorry. Another thing I would like to mention is that you can‚Äôt organize your emojis. When I find an emoji I like I add it to favorites and it just goes onto the bottom of the list. It would be really nice if I could like, hit edit and re arrange them easily or something instead of un favoriting them all and then re favoriting them all in the order I want üòÇ. It would also be nice if (on mobile), you could make the keyboard go away when you swipe it down in the status section. The way it is now, the keyboard covers up the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt clear‚Äù option and the only way i can make it go away is by clicking on the emoji button and then clicking out of it to drop down the keyboard. Other then those things, the only thing I would fix is making the emoji menu stay open until you click outside it on the website (again, for the purpose of easily spamming emojis üòÖ). I absolutely love using discord and all the things I‚Äôve mentioned are very minor issues or bugs. This app is great, and probably my most used one! Thank you Discord! Lmk if I need to explain any of this more, I‚Äôm not the best at wording.

EDIT: 
The status issue was fixed for me, i can easily click the DND option without putting down the keyboard. I have one more suggestion I forgot to put in here, but I think it would be really nice if discord streams could be a pop-out window outside the app. It would just be really convenient and nice. Again, just a suggestion tho I love this app so much | No just no 
Do not download this app | If you click the ‚Äú+‚Äù button next to the main Message input area, the media panel opens up to allow you to select images to attach. Unfortunately, as of a few versions ago, there‚Äôs no way to dismiss that panel when you‚Äôre done. It just ‚Ä¶ stay open. Forever. Unless you force-quit the app. It used to auto-dismiss itself, and I keep waiting for an update to fix the issue. No luck so far. | Good but how do you get 2 accounts on mobile | Love it | Yeah, can y'all just make it a little longer I have a lot of friends I like to talk to and really don't feel like making a server, just make the group members list longer so we can add more people to it plz, thanks for everything discord team I hope y'all have an amazing day ü§© | Discord does not know their audience‚Ä¶ I used to love using Discord to talk to my friends online and join servers but now discord became lame‚Ä¶.getting banned and my account deleted constantly for no reason. The community guidelines update was trash and all of my friends got banned as well as we were playing a game. Very disappointing watching Discord become boring and soft‚Ä¶I‚Äôll be using telegram instead. | Ignoring the horrid UI changes, the optimization of the app has degraded substantially. The app can‚Äôt handle being open for more than a minute before it slows to a crawl, requiring constant restarts. | I‚Äôm actually literally about to have to stop using discord altogether. Why in the world would you make the buttons at the bottom to switch between servers and conversations so small??? This is a SERIOUS accessibility problem. You already took away the option to swipe for your chats in one of the previous updates, and now I PHYSICALLY cannot click on any of the buttons. Thanks again for the terrible app that just keeps getting worse. More and more glad I canceled my nitro subscription and will be moving to another platform to host my group chats. | I can‚Äôt hear a single person on voice all of a sudden. Tried all their troubleshooting tips. Can‚Äôt even report it to the devs since they delete any post about bugs and then don‚Äôt even read the bug megathread. | asking a million questions i answer all change my email to my account close the app get back on and now it‚Äôs asking to change my email again this app dumb asl | The app has had a glitch for 3 months where you cannot click on OR SEE any channels within any server using the mobile app!!!

Do not download until this longstanding issue has been resolved! | Hi for awhile my phone has been acting up because it‚Äôs try to back up to ICloud, but when I got the update for Discord it wasn‚Äôt trying to then I deleted the app and redownloaded the app but now I‚Äôm not seeing any permissions to use my microphone and camera in my settings and usually it‚Äôs because of the app because it seems to me I‚Äôve done everything in and out the book to try and get this back. So please if anyone is able to help me if you can. | Ever since this new Ui update change this app been buggy as heck! | LOVE THE APP! Just wish it was more social. Like stories or even a post page for friends you have. Make it more active! | so basically, i made a new account because i cant log into my old account. i want to verify my number, but i cant because i have to remove my number from my old account. as you know, i cant log into that old account. it says its an error, so is there a chance you can fix it? | It almost never works correctly. I try to listen to a show nightly and no matter what settings I change and no matter how hard I try, audio simply refuses to work. I can chat, I can be on stage, I can participate as normal, except audio. Nothing with voice works at all. Once in a while if a video is opened during chat it just pops on, otherwise I can‚Äôt use it on mobile. It‚Äôs been this way for weeks now. No one can seem to figure anything out. An update would be nice. Any fix would be nice really. | I got my age leak and got dox | I dont like the new discord UI at all. At this point everything on the mobile app keeps getting smallef and smaller. It's not appealing to me at all. | Thanks | I have a problem from logging back in, saying my account has been disabled? i have got all my friends there, and have the 100+ dollars nitro. I have done nothing wrong. although its been a fun time using discord, i am not happy about this. please fix it now please, i dont want to pay another 100dollars for nitro again and make another account. (my friend got the same problem..) | Bro discord is good and easy to use with servers | Furries are scary | Very good | I am unsubscribing from my Nitro and here‚Äôs why: The non-abitration clause is disgusting behavior. The rumors of AI usage in the future and the fact that the company has not responded but its still been favorable makes me uncomfortable The lack of quality with every update, the app has been going downhill for two years The lack of support when needed, as obvious from the subreddit and these reviews The lack of usable nitro perks: you guys gave us a youtube coupon that we couldnt even use if we used a youtube free trial in the past at all. Ive had my google account for several years of course ive used the free trial. Yall keep giving us xbox and google stuff and nothing else. With all that being said, im disappointed in Discord. I dont know whats going on but this used to be my favorite app for chatrooms and calling.

It‚Äôs always double. I never have the problem with Uber. | I‚Äôm up and surprised at my total for a ride is more than what I sign up for. That‚Äôs the only reason for the lower rating. Aside from that they do a great job and the drivers are excellent. | The lift system kind of jerked me around a little bit. One driver seem to be going around in circles and rerouting and eventually I got the second driver who patiently waited for me while I found him. Good system, but it was a little tense finding the car that had come for me. Still I highly recommend Lyft. | Prices are observed there‚Äôs no way I should have to pay $20 for a 3 mile trip | Allen was awesome, new to Lyft, carry himself like he been with ya‚Äôll for years. Give him a bonus. | In short, this is the worst of the scooter service companies. Their ‚Äúno go‚Äù zones are far larger. than other scooter services, and they are much more strict about imposing ‚Äúincorrect parking‚Äù fines. I‚Äôll never be taking a Lyft scooter again. Thanks. | Treats drivers bad they are underpaid and it shows  Uber is almost always cheaper. The thing about this app is that it never knows my location even tho it‚Äôs turned on. Im tired of this. Very expensive and not worth it. If I could I wouldn‚Äôt use this app. Use Uber | While others were fretting about the transfer to the Airport, I was able to get a Lyft ride with a 10 minute wait at a better price than the sponsored bus and with personal service. Why go anywhere else? | Absolutely love Derek !! I was so anxious and he helped calm me down! AND I LEFT MY PHONE IN HIS CAR! He came back to give it to me! Definitely recommend Derek!! | Clean car, good driver | After much digging, you can find a place on the app to add other people as folks you can book the car for. Unfortunately, the instructions on how to book a car for somebody other than yourself are wrong, and so you can‚Äôt do this after all. | The ride was easy to schedule and got there so fast it was amazing | Very nice driver clean car and very family oriented | I would like to have this driver again for May 1 appointment that I have for national Spain Center Pain Center, Nico for 9 o‚Äôclock in the morning thank you very much | I deleted the app temporarily. When I reinstalled it, my money was gone. Lyft, why is my balance $0? | Super‚Ä¶ quick, nice, clean | I find  it pretty easy to use | Very attentive and accommodating! | Fast, Considerate, and Safe. Thanks, I would recommend without a doubt. | This app stole money from me and refuses to pay it back. You all are crooks who steal from people! | Lyft‚Äôs whole policy of ‚Äúbook a ride then call the driver to see if they can take your pet to the Emergency Vet‚Ä¶ then wait around messaging driver after driver until you find someone who will respond AND come‚Äù would be laughable‚Ä¶ if it wasn‚Äôt so darn dangerous for all the pets waiting around for a ride to get life saving care.

Just add an option when searching for a ride that asks for pet info (dog/cat, weight/size, carrier/leash, etc etc) first THEN matches you with a driver who is pet friendly. Stop gambling with pets lives. | Great driver | I‚Äôm so incredibly disappointed by Lyft. I use ride sharing almost every day and twice today, going to and leaving the airport, they dropped my ride and lied about the time. The first time the driver was all of a sudden driving the wrong direction and I had to cancel it. Almost missed my flight. The second time someone picked it up and it said one minute away, but he was still dropping someone off, then he canceled me. If Lyft can‚Äôt make this right I‚Äôm going to delete the app and tell everybody in my company not to use them. | The ride couldn‚Äôt have been better in spite of heavy traffic. The driver was perfect. The car was clean. He arrived right on time.. | It‚Äôs a bait and switch. Should be illegal. Offered pricing but then never got a driver .. waited over 30 minutes then finally booked Uber. If you want an actual ride I would never use Lyft. | This app has been defunct for two weeks that I know of. It will not load the ride  options Apple xr | It is getting worse and more unsafe every single day. 

1-Many many drivers who are different from the person who is actually registered with the company. What is the point of background check? And who is responsible if sth. happens? 
Some don‚Äôt even speak English not even a word. They can‚Äôt even say‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand English ‚Äû I don‚Äôt believe they would get the job if they can‚Äôt communicate with ppl who are taking the ride. Sometimes things can happen and we need to communicate. 

-The guidelines are so simple in the company that drivers allow themselves to give rides with a TOTALLY different car that is not even registered and then asking if I was scared to get into the car!!!this is the last ride I am taking with lyft. If the company was strict enough no one would allow him/herself to do that.

-Lying about waiting time.

-I will delete the app today because it is not my job to waste my time after every single ride to let the company know there was a safety issue. It is the company‚Äôs job to have strict rules when it comes to other people‚Äòs safety and life. | Great ride! | I meet awesome people on this app | Lyft map routing seems to always find the worst route to get me somewhere on time. My Drivers who use Google maps or Tesla maps instead of the Lyft maps consistently get me to my destination in the time it takes if I drive it myself. If they try to follow Lyft maps, we get stuck in avoidable traffic or poor routing through roads with frequent stoplights instead of highways and interstates. For goodness sake, just use Google map data or Waze or something. | Jane is very kind.  Came as fast as she could in spite of traffic. I felt very safe.  I am very pleased and thankful. | Driver was very patient and helpful.  Best Uber driver. Thanks again. | Drivers always go to the back which is no longer a through street. Based on the estimate of three minutes arrival time I chose not to drive today for a court deadline. I could see the driver was in the wrong spot and called and gave him exact directions that he somehow mess up. Twenty minutes after app originally predicted three minutes I called four times and driver refused to answer. | You'll never see me in one of those taxis smelling like pachuly again. I'm always on my way in less than 15 minutes. | Searches for ride all rhe time but doesn‚Äôt show a single ride or book any at all. Having worst experience since 2 weeks. | Best of the best!!  He even checked the seats to make sure we didn‚Äôt leave anything. Highly recommended. | Can you give explanation of hiking the prices ? I have been using Lyft from 4 months , from March 15 the prices hiked and I stopped using Lyft , a lower middle class person like us thought Lyft is a blessing but not anymore ‚Ä¶.. | Hate this app | The directions that are given to the drivers are so wrong every time I am taken somewhere! 

I find it un-nerving that you screw up the directions so badly! It is wrong every single time. 

My first request is No Prius. What shows up is a Prius!!! Luckily  
It says in my notes NO Prius! Nothing smaller than a Toyota Camry so I can get my legs in! 
The Tesla 3 and the Mustang 4 door were perfect for my legs!

Who is in charge of that? They need to be Fired! 

I really hope someone reads my notes. 

Thank you, 

Lisa Finkelstein | Awesome driver one of the best if not the best I‚Äôve ever had! Very professional and great conversation great conversation! | Awesome driver with a awesome temperament.
Already tipped him. | Jos√© was very nice | Lyft Service Is very timely! ü§ó | Sometimes it‚Äôs a good ride sometimes it‚Äôs not it all depends on the drivers | I just loved the drive | Airport ride requested using wait and save with a 12-17min ride wait instead of priority at 5min. Driver was assigned and the total wait was 13min. 1 minute from my house, with me standing on the curb driver canceled. Lyft puts me back in the wait and save loop. 11-18min again. If the driver cancels last second like that, Lyft needs to automatically prioritize the next driver. I canceled and went to uber. Wasn‚Äôt risking stress at the airport. | Would give 0 stars if I could. | When there‚Äôs no drivers, my money still gets taken and then you‚Äôre searching for a driver for over an hour or more sometimes",4.91598,14181567,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2c/99/ec/2c99ec40-05a5-84c0-4e98-5761c883a267/ad8d9f43-d9e7-42e3-8a2f-54cad1c02c49_01_EN_iOS_5.5_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b7/fd/54/b7fd5425-7384-b2da-a530-b028ece8015a/d5fa7365-daca-4cb7-9692-702c4d9baf43_2nd_JPG_Image_eng_Apple_App_Store_1242_x_2208_Wait-and-Save.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/b1/37/02/b13702a7-0967-31bf-9c33-8565918f457d/630ab86c-f972-42ab-85f7-cdb8516a1c37_3rd_JPG_Image_eng_Apple_App_Store_1242_x_2208_Airport_PU-DO.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1a/e1/af/1ae1afe1-02bd-0c94-9496-152ee5ee0d9e/2863083c-4557-4c17-87f4-d01b461f9013_4th_JPG_Image_eng_Apple_App_Store_1242_x_2208_Multimodal.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/cf/d8/4d/cfd84d0a-aa20-631b-9903-1da2b92ea636/d90ac141-5d0f-4d5a-a6c0-b55ef678f154_05_EN_iOS_5.5_1242x2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/20/ca/71/20ca7126-d355-6065-ec15-cf01e13cc452/bb5e67b7-6b70-4e7e-aa73-37c4ef953a27_6th_JPG_Image_eng_Apple_App_Store_1242_x_2208_Keep.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

If it‚Äôs not an original ticket sale or at face value, I‚Äôm done buying seats through such an anti-consumer company. It‚Äôs a shame they have such a large foothold to ruin the live event experience. | Scam company with a scam app. Filters don‚Äôt work in the app. App is not user friendly. Company is predatory. Probably one of the worst things to happen to the music industry over the years. They probably own the bots that they let buy all the tickets and then resale on their app for 500% markup. What a joke. | $40 service fee per ticket is outrageous. Also you can‚Äôt even buy tickets with the app, it has to bounce you to a website which poorly communicates with its own app. Why even have the app? What a business model. | Website and app has continual errors. Level of service charge outrageous | If you have an iPhone 14 or 15, the ""my events"" section of this app will not work. It's been well documented in many Help sites and Apple and Ticketmaster have not solved the problem to date. If you want to download your Ticketmaster tickets to your wallet, you need to download the Live Nation app instead. Hopefully this will help somebody not have to spend hours trying to get their tickets like I did. Come on Apple and Ticketmaster is a well known problem. Please fix it. | Quick, easy, efficient with Apple Pay and wallet tickets.
Chefs kiss for tickets | Necesitamos idioma en espa√±ol en la app. vivamos en Estados Unidos pero necesitamos que la app sea en espa√±ol | I‚Äôm constantly logged out of the app even when I was logged in a few days prior. Takes all the convenience away. | Excelent and fast | What‚Äôs the point of enabling users to share ticket? Or better yet connect to a calendar of our choice‚Ä¶. | Terrible | The app changed the event on me to the one the night before when I clicked the link in MLB app to open in app.  When I found out on the final screen, I immediately reported the glitch to customer support.  They refused to do anything for me. Now I‚Äôm out $55 because they won‚Äôt acknowledge the glitch, even though it‚Äôs easily reproducible with the Saturday padres game. | A group of us were student line trying to update, refresh confirmed, update, password, etc. etc. etc. etc. there is no way to get the ticket. This is the worst.  Buggy nightmare.

Nothing like not being able to get into a show with cold fingers because you have bad service | App. was downloaded, would not let me creat an account. First pg, Sign in or create an account.  next step would take me to a blank page, did it NUMEROUS TIMES. Can not download my tickets. ü§¨ | Pervasive Monopoly | Whoever programmed this app and website should be fired. Constant bugs and delays in terms of viewing my tickets, viewing my sales, or navigating the app in general. Never keeps me signed in even though this is my only account on my only device. Absolutely terrible. If it weren‚Äôt for the monopoly of all venues and artists using this company for final tickets, they wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance against the competition. | No matter how many updates have come out I can never access ‚ÄúMy Events‚Äù it goes to the page, opens a blank page and freezes.. every.. single.. time! I can buy tickets and browse events just fine but  I can only access my events and tickets through the website. Super annoying | Easy to navigate through the app however not to easy to transfer Bonus tickets. I would still give a 5 star rating for the east to use platform. | Love troye Sivan | Bad company | The site does not give adequate or clear understanding of seats that you are purchasing. The fees are extremely high also. | Ticketmaster application frequently signed me out of my logged in information and Ticketmaster as a company price gouges tickets. | I cannot believe the fees they charge. | Fast and easy to get tickets through app. | I can‚Äôt wait for this monopoly to get broken up. The platform is buggy and the fees are ridiculous. | STOP GOUGING US WITH THIS | I long for the day Ticketmaster loses it‚Äôs monopoly on concert tickets and I can just buy tickets from venues. | I have a fully updated iPhone 15 Pro, and the updated Ticketmaster app. Every time I start the app and touch ‚ÄúMy Events‚Äù the app hangs. I‚Äôve tried force-quitting, re-installing, and rebooting my phone. Same results. The web app worked fine, so I was able to view my ticket, but the dedicated iOS app is worthless. | Slow and buggy, oftentimes is completely unresponsive. 

I usually have issues right before going into a venue. Try to launch the app, have to login‚Ä¶again. Tap ‚ÄúMy Events‚Äù get nothing but a white page. 

Ticketmaster, you sukk. | Made me lose my place in line and made me sign on through an alternate device | Had trouble with payment from bank, allowing a big purchase, which caused me to miss out on VIP Imagine Dragons tickets super bummed out but able to get some tickets. Wish Ticketmaster had the option to request more time for issues like that. | This service is a horrible experience, buggy app that often crashes when real fans are trying to buy tickets and the fees are exorbitant. For how much they charge in fees the app should work perfectly and yet it feels like a 1990s beta. | For several months now, the app hasn‚Äôt been playing well if I have iPhone‚Äôs Display Zoom on. This causes the tickets page to not load at all, only a blue bar across the top and a white screen displays. You have to quit the app to be able to leave this screen. The only fix was to shut off Display Zoom. This is an iOS issue, but also a TicketMaster app issue. Garbage. | The my events tab doesn‚Äôt not load my tickets and upcoming events. It is just a blank screen and freezes the app every time to the point I have to close it and reopen it every time. I have deleted, downloaded again, updated the app and my iPhone, and tried everything I know of to get this app to work properly on an iPhone 15 pro and it just won‚Äôt. | You rape us with the fees | If I try to click into my events the entire app freezes and I cannot access my tickets or anything else in the app . If you try to get technical assistance, they send you in an endless loop of ‚Äúnon-help‚Äù. | In this modern age, in the year 2024, utilizing AI and every other mobile tech you can get your hands on, you should not be charging us these exorbitant fees. It‚Äôs an outrage. | A little hard to select the seats.  My ideal seats the app would not let me purchase.  It kept saying it would leave 1 seat available. | Trying to login and continue to receive the error:  Your session has been suspended.  Something about your browser behavior or network made us think you were a bot.

Totally useless! | Never got q for the presale password and had to start over! 360 ppl ahead of me and no seats available!! | Unless you are bot yourself you won‚Äôt be getting ticket from Ticketmaster. Today for preorder, I was in line before preorder opened, and when it opened I was 15500 person in line. I got to buy a ticket within 20 minutes. However, pay attention what kind of tickets are available. Tickets were sold out and anything available was from scalpers since Ticketmaster bluntly allow reselling of the tickets on their own service. They get service fees from original purchase and from you, while you end up either not going or paying double or triple price of the ticket straight through Ticketmaster‚Ä¶and they are the only option, you can‚Äôt get tickets through any other vendor. This is monopoly at its finest with severe predatory tactics. They should be investigated for anti consumer practices. | The processing fees are always expensive but they are a reliable way to get tickets that doesn‚Äôt do last minute take backs or try to switch things out on you. | I tried to view the details on a add on feature, but the window that popped up did not show the full statement and there was no way to go back.
Only option is ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù at top left and it took me out of my purchase.",4.77877,2895627,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/83/99/a0/8399a089-606f-7b27-d5b3-c2807bb11ba0/c5f879e6-3550-4a32-9af8-4364420b8494_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/61/b8/10/61b81016-063b-2cfe-935e-a23b7365a2cd/b482da3d-4baf-4c9a-befe-d5b0a09c6939_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/cd/04/e4/cd04e453-78b4-07fe-31f9-186d887e2612/5f05def7-3a03-4db1-88bc-f565e254137f_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/44/32/51/443251c6-b969-8633-a87d-72e87ce31f7f/8f68efc6-06e1-4a5f-9192-ae0fbc210a64_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ec/65/c3/ec65c30f-f459-050b-17b9-a8cdfa031ea9/e38f01db-d056-4ced-bbef-c65116b559b1_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4a/ce/57/4ace57be-fd9a-9ae7-6a81-9a78bd59a473/6399c043-052f-472d-beee-8ee84b8a323d_7.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b5/f3/6e/b5f36e9f-f747-c703-a97a-f5f074a052d1/ed9c28d8-ccff-4fe1-88a7-bff1121b6014_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e2/4e/fe/e24efe1d-ade3-86d5-5823-3c8859533d1b/821ad3ca-b099-4667-90db-7f1b2dda1834_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/22/2a/0e/222a0e8a-cbd7-a4e2-085d-e19b050cd427/ca5a8d29-c76c-49e5-b17f-f4788f474cb9_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/80/18/b7/8018b74c-1f4a-d0cb-2b0c-37a8b9b66dca/9b5348ed-67a0-4ac9-9f70-077b5dbf0da5_3.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

So I had to skip the pizza. WTH, I didn‚Äôt really want it anymore! | No where on this app shows a tip for the driver! I pay by credit card and nothing there to take care your drivers! Only rating 3 stars. You need to work out the bugs had to place order 3 times and it timed out twice! | Will get random error messages of can‚Äôt get local coupons, not enough space on device, the not enough space on device makes no sense considering there‚Äôs nothing on the device but work related apps. Can‚Äôt add tip for driver in app. | Handy, but it keeps crashing 50% of the time and I have to start over.  Often fails when I try to redeem points and I lose them | Love the pizza , highly recommended! | Careful to make sure you get a delivery instead  of carry out . Carry out activates without you choosing it and won‚Äôt inactivate ! So you get a surprise call! There‚Äôs a fee anyway so you may as well deliver always for my home in Savannah and Donalsonville . ! Remember if I order and you don‚Äôt see me in your Restrurant deliver in half an hour or less to my door or window ! Just tap my window and bring a 2 liter Coke or Pepsi always ! | Doesn‚Äôt access saved payment method. Can‚Äôt add tip. Apple Pay?  Don‚Äôt make it so hard to order | I never opted into marketing notifications. You enabled them anyway. I specifically disabled marketing notifications but you ignored my settings preference and continued to send them. So now I deleted your app. | I have been complaining for years that the iPad app does not provide the ability to add a tip when paying by credit card. The phone app does, the website does, why not the iPad app.  Generally the app is glitchy, first attempt says delivery is not available in my area, not true,  second attempt it works, first attempt coupon is only good for pickup back up and retry it works. Added a specialty pizza to the coupon doesn‚Äôt show up because when I selected thin crust it changed the size to 14‚Äù. Etc. etc. etc. | Get use to receiving network errors continuously only to have it start working. Have worked at ordering pizza for close to an hour before it took the order. | I ordered a pizza for my autistic son who will only eat triangle pizza called to have them fix it and they said because that‚Äôs the way the pizza is originally cut they can‚Äôt fix it | The ordering process was easy, except for an issue where I initially got network errors. My one complaint is that I couldn‚Äôt find anywhere to add a tip on the credit card. If I use my Android phone to place an order, the tip function is there. | If I could give this 0 stars I would. I‚Äôm truly not one to complain, but this app is possibly the worst on planet earth. It shorts out every time I use it, I can‚Äôt get past the loading screen.  When it does work (rare) it doesn‚Äôt let you checkout. When you finally get past checkout and are almost at the finish line, it tells you ‚ÄúError‚Äù and to call. When I delete it, look for updates, redownload and sign in, it still doesn‚Äôt work! I think if I ordered 60 times, it‚Äôs worked 2 times. Awful. Finally deleting it after three years of failure. | This app isn‚Äôt that bad. In many ways it‚Äôs very good. I particularly like the order status tracker - very clever. However, I‚Äôm giving it one star because it uses push notifications to send advertisements. I find this to be annoying and obtrusive. Worse still, there is an in-app setting to turn off ad notifications, but when you turn them off then exit settings, then go back into settings, you will see that they are still turned on. | Once you select a coupon and find out that it is not what you want, you cannot get out of that coupon. I had to go ahead and use that coupon and then go to checkout and remove the unwanted item. There needs to be a cancel button available while using a coupon. | Completely useless app and unable to get around the warning that says ‚Äúupdate your app.‚Äú So if you have an older phone that can‚Äôt install newer updates, you can‚Äôt be a customer of Domino‚Äôs because they force you to get locked out of the app ‚Äúunless you update.‚Äú | Love it, but there is no place in the app to tell them not to put powder sugar on my Lava Cakes. I don‚Äôt like the powder sugar on them and would love it if I could make them not have the extra sugar on there. | Great, when it works.  I like Dominos, but the app rarely works.  I get network errors and an out of space errors.   This never happens with the Pizza Hut app | Cannot disable notifications for promotions. | I still have not figured out a way to tip online without having to make the driver stop and have me manually add the tip at the door when delivered.  What am I missing?!   I order regularly from many restaurants and this is the only place I can‚Äôt do it! | I have used this app for delivery and it was good, but they send too many promotional texts and the app will not let you turn them off. It is deceitful because it has an option to turn them off, but it doesn‚Äôt work, it turns itself back on. I will be deleting the app. | I keep getting blasted with marketing notifications daily even though I have that ‚Äúfeature‚Äù unselected. Fix this and then I might consider actual leaving a good review. Just want notifications of when the food is ready. | Love the app normally but recently I've been getting excessive ads pushed to my Apple Watch through the Domino's app. Checked my in-app notification settings and the special offers toggle had been re-enabled without my doing. The app won't let me toggle this off, as it reverts to ON each time I return to the notification settings page.

Will update my review when this gets addressed, as this is encouraging me to disable ALL notifications from this app for the time being. | There doesn‚Äôt seem to be anywhere to add a tip.  If there is, I can‚Äôt find it anywhere.  I always ask for the delivery driver to bring the receipt so that I can add a tip.  Even though it says at the bottom of the checkout screen to make sure to tip your driver. | I love Dominos Pizza but this app and their website need some major work. Every time I try to order it freezes or there is some error. | I am so sick and tired of having to reset my password because your app can‚Äôt keep any info correctly. I‚Äôm completely done using this app and won‚Äôt be coming back. Also I will let others know not to waste their time too. I‚Äôm so disappointed and dissatisfied. WASTE OF TIME!!! | Love the new way to order.  Except I can‚Äôt change the size of the free pizza.  I could add whatever I wanted to the 12 inch medium though.  I would have given this FIVE stars BUT, you ‚Äúforgot‚Äù (?) to put a spot when checking out to tip our delivery person.  But as an afterthought, in small letters under the whole view, you put a reminder to tip the driver.  Unbelievable!  Fix it!  I had to use MY cash to tip the driver.  So glad I had $5.00 on me.  The last time I only had ten!  So I had to run to the nearest store just to get change!  Please, please fix this.  Then I will gift you 5 stars. | This app won‚Äôt allow local coupons. It will say not of enough space on device.  Ordering is very frustrating. | After updated I had  more trouble ordering through the app.    At first it wouldnt find a store ( which is about 3 miles away.  Then I ordered and paid  the tracker just froze and didnt work  Didn‚Äôt show my order as in the system.  It was there and being cooked. So we went and picked it up but please don‚Äôt update what is working | I love dominoes pizza don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love their sauce, their crust just about everything! But they won‚Äôt deliver to my address!!! And I‚Äôm not really far from the location! | The I Pad app tells me either I don't have Internet when I do, or that my local shop has no delivery available. Meanwhile I have no issues with the I Phone app. Domino‚Äôs needs to fix tis issue. | Won‚Äôt turn off notifications. If I change the setting, the app puts it back as soon as I look away. | Annoying when you hate these kinds of distractions on your phone. | My store in Seguin will deliver to a house 9 minutes away. But my house which is 7 minutes away has no delivery available and is almost a straight shot with only a couple lights in between. Dominos needs to get their delivery area sorted out. I‚Äôm deleting the app. Will check back in a year. | The app work fine for ordering.  My real issue is that Domino‚Äôs DOES NOT let you store a gift card balance as a payment method.  In fact they don‚Äôt even let you store a gift card anywhere - so this means you must keep physical gift cards and type in the 22 digits each and every time you want to use one to pay for your purchase.  

I‚Äôm pretty sure Amazon, Starbucks, etc has been doing this for over 15 years now.   Why does Domino‚Äôs not get with the program on payment methods - they want you to lose them so they don‚Äôt have to redeem them.  Pretty poor customer service IMO. | Almost unusable lately. Any attempt to change location or from delivery to pickup fails with ‚ÄúNetwork Error‚Äù. Nearly went to another pizza app but just barely got a complete order, just not the way I wanted it. | I cannot for the life of me find anywhere where I can add a tip.  I believe I am using the most up to date app and I like to give tips. Even though it‚Äôs not delivered they still work hard especially at night and I would love to leave one.  Could you please either let me know if I‚Äôm missing something OR add a feature that would allow us to add an app to the order?  Thanks so much. | As the title says I cannot turn off offer notifications while keeping delivery notifications on, I can only disable system notifications in my settings app | The rewards program is a joke!  We order pizza once a week for our son. We‚Äôve earned enough for several free pizzas but if I try to order just one pizza with our reward they will not take the order unless I add a second pizza. So I always have to pay for a pizza if I want delivery or order two pizzas (for one person). That‚Äôs a rip off! | I can‚Äôt find a way to use car side delivery.  It doesn‚Äôt offer Apple Pay as an option. I‚Äôm not real fond of any apps, but this one is particularly hard for this old man. | App doesn‚Äôt show the pricing of menu items until after you add to the cart. Shady practice. Also, app doesn‚Äôt store gift card codes. They need to be entered each time you order. | I hate push notifications.  I tried disabling them in this app, but the settings are always reverted back to on whenever I go back into the settings menu.

Is this a bug or poor business practice? | Please fix the iPad version or create a version that works on an iPad.  This one used to work but doesn‚Äôt anymore ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThank you | Ridiculous how difficult the app is to use. Can‚Äôt order and pay by cash. Can‚Äôt copy and paste card info. Took me 45 minutes to just to get through everything just to get my pizza order placed. | You are UNABLE to opt out of 'Special Offers and Deals' notifications. When you uncheck it and click done it just re-enables it. | Dominos allowed my kids and I to watch the toppings go onto the pizza as if we were at the store. My kids loved it tapping around so I thought it was cool. | they send you emails that say you have free items but really you gotta spend 20 bucks before you get it like what? don‚Äôt email me saying in big bold letters it‚Äôs free if it‚Äôs not, dumb and misleading marketing and just makes me go to other better pizza places. | The setting doesn't work | I tried removing promotional notifications on my phone because they're annoying, so I checked it off in the app and pressed done.

(Decode) | I don‚Äôt know what to do with this | Instead of continuing to play a game I decided to have fun and learn! | I‚Äôve been doing dualingo for about a week now and I have learned so much. There is a safe amount of adds and the app is very appealing. | Ok first of all this app has helped me a lot when it comes to learning a language I‚Äôve had way more improvement then I thought I would have. Second of all I‚Äôve noticed that when I have super duolingo it still uses hearts and I still run out. It‚Äôs saying I have unlimited hearts but still I‚Äôm still losing hearts so idk what to do but other than that Duolingo has helped me get better at learning languages I highly recommend it | Fun | I like it BUTTTTT,why did u had to add lifes to the game it just makes it so much harder to learn,because if u make 5 mistakes u can‚Äôt be learning anything. | Duelingo helped me learn French and Spanish so quickly! | And please bring duo don't forget him | I messed up my streak, I want to go home-
Duo is nice, smart, tall, and sweet! | Excelente he aprendido mucho gracias a esta aplicaci√≥n tan buena | Yo amor D√∫o lingo por mi Espa√±ol! | Alex | After a 261 day streak it says that if I don‚Äôt do my daily Duolingo I was going to lose my streak because I didn‚Äôt have any more streak freezes equipped, but I do remember doing it the last two days before and it must have not counted. Almost lost my streak due to a error in their system. Not to happy. Other than that it‚Äôs pretty good app. | I am glad to find an app that can teach me language 5min a day to as long as I want to practice and it reminds me so I don't fail my streaks. I can change the language without losing progress in another, I can add friends and encourage them on their success as well. The only language they don‚Äôt have I wish they had is Sign Language using visual cartoons to display hand motion signs. Perhaps a goal the app can add from more feedback on others. ü§üüòÉüßã | Helps learn with no pressure on kids and adults. Is a fun way of learning a new language. Has adds which can get in the way sometimes but other than that it is great and has fun rewards and prizes for young kids and adults which can make them want to learn but there is adds so just be aware. I gave this a 4 star because I really enjoy learning and it is a positive experience and way to learn. The reason I did not give it a 5 star is because of the adds. The last thing that I like about this game is that it does not take a lot of energy on your device. Thanks for listening. Have a wonderful day. | Hi I‚Äôve been with Duolingo for almost a year now. The only thing is when I test my family that knows Spanish, some of the words are different. Please make Mexican Spanish as well! | AMAZING I LOVE THIS APP IT TAUGHT ME SO MUCH SO FAST!!!!!!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöü©µüíôüíúü©∑ü§çüñ§ü§éü©∂ | Omg I‚Äôve been learning so much with this I love you duolingo and I promise I‚Äôll do me Spanish so I don‚Äôt vanish | Duolingo is a app my friend has and she inspired me to get it! I do Spanish right now im on my 14 day streak I reackmaend Duolingo for people that want to learn a different laungege and also I got super Duolingo for free for three days! have  a good day bye! | Very good and you must do your duo or your family will be gone! | I love this app BUT is only limited to Spain Spanish but I want to learn Mexico Spanish. | Illooovvvee iiitttt | My overall opinion is the same amount of stars I put up there. üëÜ. It‚Äôs a app good for learning and keeps us as students eager to keep going. We always beg to go past our goal on Doulingo which makes our teachers especially Ms.Gonzalez proud which makes us feel so good too. There are some things though, it never gives me any new nouns and what not it always gives me little kid stuff like leche (milk) mujer (woman). It‚Äôs honestly good to know but it doesn‚Äôt really help me make a sentence unless I‚Äôm asking do you drink milk or do you drink water. Or my name is such and such. Well technically so but I‚Äôm one for learning new stuff not sticking to the same. So I‚Äôd just like to clarify that but good job. Respect Duolingo. | Love duo he‚Äôs sooo cute and this app helps me with Spanish and math!üíöü¶â | I am here to brush up on conversational skills.  The drills are good for remembering placement, conjugation and pronunciation but the spelling is unnecessary. I cannot type on the train and I had to re-type ‚ÄúMarie‚Äù over and over.  I can‚Äôt turn off the spelling checker part. | I forgot i had thia app and i was going to japan for a bit in 2024 may but then i found this app which saved me from having to speak riggidy while there! | This has helped me with Spanish ALOT! :) | i love it, helped me learn so well! started last month and already 3 path things, thank you duolingo, for keeping me motivated, 

-Francesca | Duolingo is amazing I personally love it!! | I LOVE duolingo becasue it tought me Chinese and he makes it entertaining 
And fun so i stay commited to keep on learning Chinese now learning Chinese is way more fun than normally Learning it. When he said ""fun is his specialty""he wasn't lieing at all he makes ut super fun and thats why i would have never wanted to learn Chinese if it wasn't for duo.        

               -Learning Chinese without duo. I could never. | Duolingo is a amazing learning app and I have learned a lot of Spanish from it. I really recommend it for everyone. Duolingo is a not only fun but a very good learning app. I love Duolingo and I always will. I 10/10 recommend it for you.      :) | So good | Good job | Great job am learning A lot thank you. 

But could you stop with the strikes? It is stressful and my dad doesn‚Äôt let me. He says that it‚Äôs your way of making people do Duolingo. | My family is Polish and Ukrainian, and I always had trouble learning and understanding my native language. Luckily, Duolingo makes is SO EASY to understand. I am so thankful for this app. | I love this bc they can teach me everything I need to know | I‚Äôm in his basement and I‚Äôm so happy üòÅ | So thankful to be learning | It is a amazing app to learn a new language. It can be easy, hard or just right. You can also get hints if you need to. It is also free to play but you need to pay for unlimited hearts and no ads. | Love this app, seriously, I have learned so much French in the past year. And I have a new idea. Since duolingo has added customizable avatars, it would be cool to be able to buy different faces, hats, glasses, and more. The prices could range from 100-1000 gems. There wouldn‚Äôt be items only for max and super v.i.p though | Like the title says, I feel like Duolingo is fine, but it also seems to have moved somewhat backwards in terms of what it offers. From removing the downloaded offline lessons, to removing the discussions/comments in the app, it is becoming less helpful than it once was. I travel frequently and the offline lessons were useful, and I would very frequently refer to the discussions if I didn‚Äôt understand why I made a mistake and would oftentimes find the answer there. This would help me have an overall better understanding of what I was learning so I could actually understand the language, not just memorize phrases. After some years of having a premium subscription I finally decided to cancel it. I just have a hard time justifying the price for a language learning system that seems to regularly remove features that actually help learn the language rather than maintain a streak. I would reconsider if some of the previous features were returned. | Muchas gracias por el juego me encant√≥ mucho. | Okay first off I wanted to learn how to speak Spanish.

It is DISGUSTING.

The ads also include sexual content.

And there are too many posts underneath posts that have nothing to do with the topic post. I have had to block so many accounts it‚Äôs not even funny.

Hire back all the engineers you fired from Twitter because X is an absolute MESS. You should be ashamed of yourselves. | Tried continuously to login.

This should have been said in the website instead of forcing a download of their app. 0/5 stars, I‚Äôm uninstalling. | logging into paypal credit takes me to white blank screen.

So it basically just robbed me of over a 120 dollars and won‚Äôt help me at all. | I like the app, BUT, one thing that really bugs me is the PayPal credit card section. It only shows transactions since the last statement date. So for instance, today is 4/26, and my statement date is 4/24 so I can only scroll down 2 days worth of transactions. I have to go to monthly statements to see any other transactions.

I transferred $80 dollars from my bank to PayPal by mistake. I forgot that I usually pay via PayPal not add money. When you add money it takes 4-5 business days to clear.

It said estimated time would be the 25th as clear date and it‚Äôs now the 26th and my money is still not available. I‚Äôm very angry, customer service keeps telling me they can‚Äôt help, not that I can get a real person to help, it‚Äôs always an AI chat that only gives me article links instead of answering my actual questions. Playing with peoples money is a great way to lose customers. It‚Äôs not okay what‚Äôs so ever. I need my money back. If it‚Äôs not returned immediately I WILL find a way to sue this platform. Blatantly taking my money and not letting me use it. Very upset. | i canceled paypal two months ago and yet a $300.00 payment stillll paid for makeup | Anything that would require me to log in (sending money or sending an invoice, for example), causes the app to freeze. Basically rendering it completely useless. | I have had PayPal for awhile now and let me tell you, at first it‚Äôs ok if I had issues I call them and they always helped me to take care of issues with whatever it may be. 
Here recently I had several reacurring charges in which I filed a case with. I called and explained my situation and what was happening they filed several cases for me. 1 for each charge. A month + later I am told because of my history ‚Äúwhatever that means ‚Äú they denied it. Close to $600 I got scammed for and PayPal let it happen. And I sent $500 to who I thought was supposed to get it only to realize I sent to the wrong person. I remediately tried to stop it in a pending mode which should have stopped it. And said I can‚Äôt I contacted the guy, he refuses to give it back and PayPal says nothing they can do about it. Again getting ripped off PayPal siding with thieves. So beware. Use at your own risk. | Can‚Äôt login, I‚Äôve changed the password 5 times (it‚Äôs the same password each time) and right after ‚Äúchanging‚Äù the password it just says error. Even when I was logged in, they kept trying to perform a ‚Äúsecurity check‚Äù which just endlessly loads. The app is completely broken it‚Äôs insane. | Only a one star review because TD Bank a very popular east coast bank has not been offered on PayPals services for well over a decade. You would think they would‚Äôve done something about it by now! | I was logged in but it just keeps trying to log in with Face ID and never loading. Over and over it scans for my face. I deleted the app and redownloaded it. Now it won‚Äôt even let me log in, just gives a white screen when I try to click to sign in. | I haven‚Äôt used the app in almost a year because they won‚Äôt hide my email address.When you make a purchase some sellers just spam you but if you get the right seller mad you get phished!Pay attention | A seller sold me two items and one was defective. The ‚Äúcase‚Äù took over two months for a response from paypal and the response was for me to pay the return shipping for the items while sending them back. Yes because that makes so much sense for me to pay for the sellers problem even though they scammed me. It‚Äôs too late for me to dispute with my bank now. Useless app and company in general. | Paypal, on every platform, has a problem with 2 factor verification log in. If you change your phone number, it will update in their system, but any log in page that needs to text you a code will still display the old phone number and send the code to that number instead of the updated one in the database, unless you tap ""having trouble logging in?"" at which point it will display the new phone number and even send the code to that new number. This is a lame, amateurish hole in their security and could make you lose access to your account. Often times the ""having trouble logging in?"" link will not allow you to text the new number, it just tells you to call their phone answer tree, which is a cruel waste of time / a punishment. Help desk can't do anything for you and if you try to explain this bug to them they will either not understand or delete your ticket or even your entire account (seriously, it happened to me). I've reported this bug many times and they won't do anything about it. They either don't care or maybe their software security team can't figure out why this is happening, its pathetic. This bug prevents me from accessing my account / online shopping, even from this app, about 2/3 of the times I try to log in, maybe more. This is usually due to the ""having trouble accessing?"" link only working within certain webpages or apps, so the correct phone number will usually not display. | This app not letting me log in!!!! Fix it | PayPal has a set 3.49% processing fee in place as well as a $0.49 per transaction on top. 

I feel like there should be a smaller processing fee and waived transaction fee for under a $100.

Also never leave your money in PayPal, Venmo or any entity that‚Äôs not FDIC insured. Some guy had over a  $1 million in his PayPal. 

 There was an internal investigation done on this particular incident. Mid-level manager was giving his hacker friend all the high value  accounts that he stumbled upon. 

$1,000,000 in a PayPal account? buggin | App always freezes/crashes when i send invoice. I already updated the app. Still crashing. Please fix | No matter how hard I look on the app. PayPal credit will not show up. | PayPal dispute/synchrony credit  even though they get all the documentation needed and they sit on it for 30 days and then they close the dispute stating they don‚Äôt receive any documentation without requesting customer for more information , this is pathetic and fraud banking company and will not recommend to have business with them and I am surprised how this bank runs with so much negligence. Seems like paypal credit by synchrony is the last bank you should have business with . | Plataforma echa para estafar. Ojoooo se quedan con tu dinero y una pesima atencion al cliente. Todo propiciando el ambiente de fraude que tienen en la plataforma. | Have had fees charged on incoming and outgoing transfers which were substantial and a surprise to sender and recipient.

My wife an I use it all the time to share bills and reimburse each other. Then all of the sudden the button to transfer to my bank account has disappeared from the main screen. Now I can‚Äôt find it. Every time I want to move money to my bank it takes me 10 minutes to go through menus and figure out how. I know you want to sit on my money PayPal but come on, this is ridiculous! | ...the problem comes in when trying to add funds from my bank account. I see NO way to do that via the app. I had to open Safari, go to PayPal.com, then log in and do it from the browser. Even then it's very challenging to find the bank link up.

Otherwise I very much enjoy the PayPal app. | Horrible support | Desde hace bastante tiempo que no funciona la opci√≥n de transferir que parece despu√©s de darle al saldo, que es la opci√≥n que te permite enviar el dinero a tus cuentas personales. | Every single time I use pay pal for a money transfer it is a total nightmare. Load times for the app are insane. Especially when you‚Äôre waiting over half a hour to no avail. It‚Äôs crazy it‚Äôs so crazy that it cannot perform simple functions. | They never asked to login with phone number now out of the blue they want to login with phone number what happened if I don‚Äôt have the same number do I lose my money u theif | It better paying from other credit cards not paypal account. I have ordered an item by using paypal payment and the vendor dint deliver the item to me, so requested for a refund and unfortunately paypal cannot help me in any way for the refund. If the payment is made from your credit card you can dispute it easily. | any time i try to send money it takes forever and we have tried to talk to representatives on the phone about it and no answer, they won‚Äôt let me add my bank account only my bank card and the money takes forever | The paypal badge is disappearing at home page. And i can‚Äôt find it. | Cards, bank link, nothing couldn‚Äôt get any funds into my PayPal account takes forever to use their automated customer support and when you finally get a human, they still couldn‚Äôt do anything. They told me to wait a couple days multiple times and it‚Äôs still never worked, I went to my bank to make sure there was no restrictions, or things holding me back, and there wasn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know why none of my stuff worked, but it didn‚Äôt and they didn‚Äôt help at all!

I connected my paypal to my bank, linked card w/ the right info and everytime I QR scan to pay, the ‚Äúlink a card‚Äù GUI pops up. So I link my card again and it keeps bouncing back to the ‚Äúlink a card‚Äù GUI. I can‚Äôt be bothered, DO NOT share your bank information with PayPal, don‚Äôt bother getting this app at all! Does not even work! | Got banned for adding money to my balance and transferring it to my new bank while waiting for my direct deposit to kick in at my new bank. Apparently finance as usual is not acceptable use of a financial service. Cancelled my account, and won‚Äôt be using ever again. | I‚Äôve had the app for years it used to work great but for several months now I can‚Äôt even login into the app! It just stays stuck on an endless glitching looped security check screen. It‚Äôs so frustrating! Instead of being convenient for on the go it‚Äôs useless! I need to be able to use the app!! Fix the problem asap! | The update from a few days ago places way too much real estate on shopping which is never something I‚Äôd do with PayPal.
This is functionality that directly benefits PayPal and not the user.

I tried to figure out how to transfer money to my checking account, something I do at least weekly, and I gave up and went to the website.

Decreasing usability and functionality is always an awful choice. | My PayPal account has been hacked TWICE. Not worth keeping anymore. | I keep having to reboot my iPhone to get the app to work.  I've decided not to have my savings with PayPal because of the inconvenience.  I may need to discontinue other uses as well because of the hassle. | These jerks made it possible for Roku to immediately charge me for a $200 subscription I never wanted. I never clicked on the item, never clicked anything to purchase it, and definitely never agreed to pay $200 but I immediately received a pay pal email saying I‚Äôve been charged $189.99. I have no option to cancel until next year which is pointless. The charge brought my bank account negative and until I get money I am being pushed further into debt over some garbage sport package I did t even want. Heaven forbid I attempt to get customer service because the best they did was to cancel so it doesn‚Äôt renew in April 2025, a year from now. Somehow their rep thought this was adequate. | I have never ever had such a frustrating experience with ANY company.
Just trying to update my card expiry update and security number fails each time.
I cannot pay myself.. NOTHING works as advertised and now after 3 years they can stick the balance in my account as i quit.
I will never pay anyone or accept payment through this crappy immature company. A pity there is a no star option!
Come back  Elon. they broke it! | ver 8.60.1 has no Qbar scan pay hi | I went to make an account out in the app is says you have to be 18 or older but in the app description it says 4 or older. | In addition to using auto pay, I want to use another method to pay instantly. 
Cash Back World MasterCard!!! | Never been a PayPal customer, but I know this rating would be what it was some 15-20 years ago. PayPal isn‚Äôt even worthy of 3 stars. Complaints after complaints from people because the company is very unethical and illegal doing this such as freezing accounts, holding money, asking a lump sum of personal information to confirm there is no suspicious activity. Honestly a laundry list of things. For me, I said I don‚Äôt have an account but I‚Äôm writing this review because I have still not gotten money back for transactions I didn‚Äôt make since 2021. Everyone has confirmed I didn‚Äôt make transactions, including merchants, bank, chief police detective of my town, among others. But my money is still being held unnecessarily, and that is considered illegal because they have no right over that. I would highly urge others to file some sort of lawsuit or other legal case against them if you‚Äôre in a similar boat as me where the company has scammed or deceived you. | Over half the time the app just has a blank white screen or loading circle when trying to do anything. Constantly hangs and never loads, even after a restart, and then I just end up having to switch to my  desktop, but even then sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work and I have to wait a day or two. I‚Äôm constantly telling people ‚ÄúPayPal seems to be having issues today I‚Äôll try again tomorrow.‚Äù

I also don‚Äôt understand why there has to be a separate PayPal app for invoices and some payment features. It didn‚Äôt used to be this way. It‚Äôs very annoying having to be like ‚ÄúOh wait which app do I need to open to do this?‚Äù

Between the app just not even working half the time, the exorbitant fees, the invasive business practices, the whole US tax issue, the scandals, etc. I avoid using PayPal as much as I possibly can nowadays.

I shouldn‚Äôt have to be in IT to make the system work. | My transaction was del ones even though i have the funds., and they couldn‚Äôt give me any answers as to why. I spoke to my bank and they said my card should be working. | Sitting on the side of the road a family member Venmo‚Äôs me gas and I can‚Äôt transfer it because ‚Äú Venmo security is declining it and they can‚Äôt push it through‚Äù so now I‚Äôve been sitting on the side of the highway for 12 hours. Great customer service Venmo. | they stole my money.  they let me set up an account under 18 and then said i can‚Äôt have my own money | They have zero ways to report fraud . Seriously they should be taken down for being a financial company with no fraud protection. | Love the no monthly fees | I just paid my sister and Venmo put it on my Venmo card and charged me $18 in fees.  Should have put it on my bank account.  Closing my Venmo credit card. | ‚ù§Ô∏è | I have been trying to use Venmo for the last five days. it declines all of my cards which I have more than enough money on each one. Spent countless hours with credit card companies they don't understand. Spent hours with Venmo and all they say is it's Venmo issue. Fix it | It‚Äôs just the best! | Have had my account hacked about 10 times, and will now be deleting my account.  No one in customer service willing to help at all.  Thankfully, after the initial time, I refused to attach any bank accounts and removed all but $30 from the account.  This has happened to more people that I know of than I can count- and it is absolutely ridiculous that they have no protection in place for this. | Absolutely love the simplicity and secured features Venmo offers! It has changed my way or transfer funds on a weekly basis to friends an family. Thank you guys for everything!! | Used Venmo for about one year with no trouble, then suddenly got declined transactions and customer services could not help not explain why and what I could do. I tried everything but to no avail. Venmo is not usable by me anymore.‚òπÔ∏èüò° | I have been suspended since December. I have tried getting my account fixed. Just last week I talked with someone on the phone he said he would definitely make sure they know I have done everything I was asked to do. He said it would only take 24-48 hours to fix everything. I really would hate to see what there 24-48 hours really are. I have even asked just to close my account. He said I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt do that. He also replied no one will contact you by phone it is all email. I understand why. They don‚Äôt want to hear what people may have to say.  If I can get it straightened out I will close my account. I wish I knew what to do from here. | Don‚Äôt use chase credit card with Venmo. You will be charged $10.00 per transaction.  Horrible scam! | No way to fix problems | Wont let me add from my bank this is a stupid app | Only reason I‚Äôm keeping the app is because some of my family only uses this I‚Äôm going to try to get them to switch to cash app cause my experience was horrible with you guys !!!! I had to send some bitcoin which is says you allow I add it and it doesn‚Äôt let you send it I message them for help I get the response we don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs doing that nothing you can do if you need the funds immediately just put them back in your bank. Now I need to pay another fee but what ever go to put it in my bank now with an immediate transfer now that don‚Äôt work message for help again get the response we don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs doing that you can try the standard transfer‚Ä¶. You guys are dealing with my money and you don‚Äôt know why I can do anything with it that seems a little weird to me and personally coming from someone who worked for a bank you never say that and you always find someway to help fix it!!! Worst service ever the money that needed to get somewhere fast was now 4 days late !!!! It said with the standard transfer since I did it early enough it would be there the next day that was a lie to it took the full 3 days anyways‚Ä¶. Stay clear away from this app if you need money quick I hope I can get my family to switch because that‚Äôs an uncalled for experience! | Had this app for years but won‚Äôt let me log back into my account. Changed my password and still won‚Äôt let me into my account again | I have had several issues with either sending or receiving payments with this app and every time I call to get help I have to go through a limited phone options and there‚Äôs no way to get in contact with a live customer support person and then it‚Äôll just tell you to go online on the app. You do that and it‚Äôs another redundancy labyrinth that‚Äôll leave you with a migraine and no help. Then you‚Äôll find yourself like this having to send an email via contact form and wait for a response, so might as well write my review of this app, since I was asked | I love how convenient Paying Friends, clients & family members is with Venmo. And you have a record of it. Also you can request to be paid for services. I‚Äôm a fan. | Absolutely hate that I have to continue using this account for bills because no matter when I make payments or transfers my money is in limbo for 5-7 days if not up to 25 days making it very hard to pay my bills. Using card for perks provided but more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. | Good way to quickly exchange monkey. | still not sure how it works ü§∑ | I am trying to get my money and can‚Äôt get no answers for two days. | I‚Äôve had to turn off badge notifications (the red numbers on the app icon) because I canNOT clear the dumb notification within the app about entering your tax info for selling goods and services. I‚Äôm NOT selling stuff and have no interest in providing Venmo my tax info. I have seen the notification. I want to dismiss it for good. How do I get rid of the dumb notification within the app so I can turn badge notifications back on?????? | Card options are the best Anything metallic is out of this world! Fun!! | My wife sent me $1 to verify my account was active.  Then she sent $150.  I transferred the funds to my verified checking account. Venmo blocked the transfer and suspended my account.  What????  This app is horrible!! | Used Venmo with protection and got scammed. Opened a case and three days later not heard a thing back. | Lost my card as a teen account for debit card but can‚Äôt report it as lost because I didn‚Äôt put it into Apple wallet and have no way to reach Venmo for assistance tried AI assistance but it kept repeating the instructions but In my circumstances I do not have it in my wallet my parent for the account can only report their own card | Worst app that I have ever used talking to the people at Venmo is like talking to a first grader. These people have messed with my money way too much. | i had an error with a transfer from my bank where venmo pulled the funds almost two weeks after the transaction?? and my bank declined the transfer because it wasn‚Äôt authorized by me so my venmo account got locked and now their super amazing software has decided it‚Äôs forever no longer a viable way to transfer money in their app and not a single person who works there can fix it! isn‚Äôt that just so silly! 

funny how it was a perfectly viable option when the money was fixing my balance but now that it‚Äôs not owed to them suddenly they can‚Äôt use my bank anymore!! and not a soul there can fix it! forever and ever my bank account is useless now!

designing a money sharing app where you and your employees can‚Äôt access the software running the app is completely insane and its mind blowing to me that the only response i can get from anyone is basically ‚Äúsowwy the computer decided :(( nobody can change the computer :(‚Äú | Super easy, user friendly, quick, and reliable. | My account is frozen for no reason. I only used Venmo once for payment and it went through back in 2022. Why would my account be frozen? The help section of the app was useless. The chat bot was just as useless. I‚Äôd rather use CashApp or Zelle, zero problems. | Had a paying customer pay me with Venmo. Tried to link up my bank account and couldn‚Äôt do it.  Got a email saying that my account was frozen. Showed proof of identity, plus proof of bank statements.  Unfroze my account, next morning froze it again.  I lost $350 for mower repair.  No more Venmo for me.  Very frustrated and I cannot access my money. | Purchases DECLINED even when attached to legit bank account?  Yes!   Venmo Debit Cards must be ‚Äúpre-loaded‚Äù by user now.  My ‚ÄúVenmo Debit Card‚Äù was declined yesterday, even though there was More Than Adequate Funds in bank account attached. | Venmo truly cannot be this bad of a business. Especially in today‚Äôs electronic world. Venmo allowed a payment to process for insurance. Than Venmo would not take a regular payment to a debt. Oh my gosh, seriously I just don‚Äôt even know what to say. Call them before you do anything. Call the CS number before you attempt ANYTHING. Call them for everything. This has to be a joke.  3rd bad review. | I‚Äôm not one to write reviews, but feel it‚Äôs necessary after my experience. I have been using Venmo for years and have always enjoyed the service, but this week they took it to a whole new level! I was unfortunately scammed this last week, and even though the whole process has been scary and stressful, the team at Venmo has been SO helpful. Like, I end our chats in tears of joy helpful (which I didn‚Äôt think was even possible at a time like this ü•π) Everyone I‚Äôve spoken to has been so kind, patient, and understanding. Not to mention, Venmo resolved my issue in LESS than 24 hours!!! I have been in contact with other 3rd party apps similar to Venmo about the same issue, and none of them have even come CLOSE to being as helpful as Venmo has been. I can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôll ever use anything other than Venmo to pay or receive money again!!!! | If I were to rate you from one to 10, I‚Äôd give you a one. I have talked to three representatives the chat and nobody can help me get my payment sent. It‚Äôs crazy. I have money in my bank. I‚Äôve been using Venmo and everything is declining and nobody can help me so I think I will just go look for another resource thank you thank you. This is terrible that this review won‚Äôt send because I didn‚Äôt give you any stars and you don‚Äôt deserve any stars | 70 bucks trapped in this garbage app.  No idea why it‚Äôs suspended or how to contact anyone | This app is just stupid. How can you accept my bank and a card but when I try to do instant transfer you deny me. Obviously if I‚Äôm willing to pay the stupid fee I should be able to get my money instantly bc obviously I NEED IT but no I get denied and have to use standard. They said it would be available by today. There‚Äôs no estimated time. I still don‚Äôt have my money and my kid needs diapers but because my WORK CHECK was sent to me through VENMO I CANT GET MY CHECK. Just stupid and unreliable. PayPal should have threw this app in the trash and left it at just PayPal. | They are literally thieves at venmo. Magically purchase protection turns itself on every single time. They make it insanely difficult to cancel a payment now even though you used to be able to with ease. Trash app owned by trash humans. As if you don‚Äôt have enough money already. | not secure or safe. scammers and hackers everywhere | When it works it‚Äôs great ,  when it doesn‚Äôt you can‚Äôt find any help. | i have had ongoing issues everytime i have tried to contact venmo support, they do not provide any helpful information if by a miracle you get someone on the phone/in chat. They will keep your account frozen and keep YOUR money from you while you are treated as less than a priority! ü§¨ | So EASY to manage all transactions and get help when needed. | Figured I would try this app/service out and it doesn‚Äôt work. Can‚Äôt verify my bank account. Also the customer support is pretty awful and takes forever. | I received a fraudulent attempt for me to pay someone I don‚Äôt know. Venmo makes it impossible to report | I have not had a good experience with Venmo in months! I CANNOT add funds to my account! I keep getting an error message that basically says 
‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt add your money Our support team is ready to help‚Äù The support team is NO HELP! 
They just keep saying it‚Äôs my bank and my bank is saying it‚Äôs not them. I‚Äôve tried using different cards to add money and get the same message every time. In fact when I tried to add a new card I get an error message saying that my zip code is incorrect or invalid. That is the only zip code that I have and have used the same zip for years!

Too many gimmicks. | They don‚Äôt give you what you pay for | Great job | Enjoy when the OLD photos pop up. Seeing all the memories is nice. üòÅ | You all rock | Getting the occasional reminders of pictures that were taken of yesteryear brings back such great memories! | It‚Äôs such a pain to just take specific photos that I already have in a folder in my iPhone photos to upload just those specific photos to share on google photos for school events, etc. I now have to go back through tons of photos in google photos instead of just being able to click add photos, access the photos on my iPhone in that folder and upload from there. I hate this app | INDEED ‚ÄºÔ∏è ON THE PHOTOS GOOGLE. | Stupid badge icon to make you think a social interaction but is just to sell you an album | From lost family members to making memories! It has been a tremendous help | Thank you for helping me organize my pictures, reminders of sweet memories üòçü•∞ I also love the clearing storage feature, saves me so much time üëçüèº Super convenient for my adhd brainüòé | ...so long as Google doesn't bar you from recovering you address because you forgot the password (like after a medical procedure; I've lost thousands in online ALAC & WAV music due such an event). | I have thousands of photos stored in Google Photos from the days when reduced-quality photos could be stored infinitely, so I keep this app around even though it doesn‚Äôt have much use anymore. That being said, ever since revoking the app‚Äôs permission to view my entire camera roll it won‚Äôt show me ANY of my photos anymore. Access to my camera roll is not required to show me what I have stored from years ago‚Ä¶ Google is just greedy for private data. Don‚Äôt bite. | Excellent | So easy to organize and share. | LOST ALL MY PHOTOS!!!! DO NOT USE HORRIBLE APP EVEN WITH FREE TRIAL!! DO NOT USE THIS APP | The app tries to (desperately) help us with space/storage management. Other apps ONLY try to push sales options to deal with running out of space. | To put it plainly it‚Äôs a great photo backup app that quietly and effectively backs up my photos on my iPhone to a seco dary back up source so that even if my iCloud storage gets full or there is an issue with a video or photo upload or even an accidental deletion there is google photos to have a backed up copy to a different platform and safely there for me to retrieve it. 

It‚Äôs always best practice to always have a secondary back up of all data in a secondary location not connected in any way to your primary data saving solution and this does the job perfectly. | Great aap! | Love the daily memory albums!  Keep up the great work! | Excelente | There is nothing more satisfying than getting confetti on your screen after clearing your storage. The mange photos options helps a lot getting your storage cleared. | Me encanta | I really appreciate this photo app. No matter it's popular! The ability to fix and enhance pics would make it even better. | Best app ever. Would recommend it for photos lovers..... | All the cartoons, movies and Anime are awesome better than making a tv show or a live event at some point. | What a wonderful place to have all my memories in one place and easily accessible | They brought back my memories, enjoyed with the music matched! | Wish the slideshow creator had more features | My go to app for all photos management and editing. | Photos disappearing from album, unable to edit descriptions | Excellent! | Thank you!! | It won‚Äôt let me delete photos I don‚Äôt need to archive them | Muy buenos | I just had my phone stolen and lost over 2,000 photos because the backup didn‚Äôt finish | Not cross platform friendly. Hate everything about it. | Certainly! Google Photos is an exceptional app for managing and organizing your photo collection. Its intuitive interface, smart AI features, and seamless sharing options make it a standout choice. Whether you're reliving cherished memories or editing your photos, Google Photos delivers a delightful experience. Highly recommended! üì∏üåü | When you want it | I love Google Photos. Lots of storage and easy to make albums. | Excellent | It asks if you want to clean up (delete)‚Äòpictures but gives no option on how to do this. | Aunque uno se siente vigilado es bueno tener todas sus fotos organizadas incluso por fecha y ubicaci√≥n. | Thanks | I have used this app for over a decade and I am yet to be disappointed with. I can search and find all my photos over the years. As a photographer it is a great help when I upload photos I want to share with clients to demonstrate my skills. Its editing tools can be improved to add more features. I enjoy the recommendations and how it stores my photos in memory files to remind me of occasions passed.

Great app overall except for the editing tools. | The map hot spot alone is worth having this app. It‚Äôs an excellent way to backup all your photos and organize by person, place, album, or any other way you can find. Even has a pet option. Sharing option is easy.

If you urgently looking for employment do not come to this. They post ‚Äújobs‚Äù as if they‚Äôre hiring but never get back to you. | Literally already found 2 jobs from this app, hired and everything. 
Really good app and easy to apply. Employees definitely reach out but sometimes do have to call. | I have two issues with this otherwise pretty good app. The first issue is that there is no way to add a preferred name. I would like to only have my preferred name visible, but legally I cannot apply for jobs with a name that is not my legal name. When applying for jobs it automatically gives them whatever name is in your profile. It would also be great if there was an optional section for pronouns on the profile. The second issue is with job searching. I cannot work full time, and despite putting that in my profile and searching for jobs that are not only full time, I will still get job feed recommendations, and emails, about full time positions. Indeed also keeps showing me positions for companies that I no longer work at, even if I select to ‚Äúhide‚Äù jobs from them. If these are addressed I will definitely change my review. Thank you! | Love this app it‚Äôs helped me sense the first time I ever tried finding jobs ! One down fall is how bad it hurts your eyes , not that it‚Äôs a massive deal but I think it would be nice if you guys had a dark mode for the app or even the website. | I used to love Indeed but now that the filters do absolutely nothing I have to waste hours trying to find a relevant job. It‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt even matter what we‚Äôre asking for. I ask for night shift and you show me day shift. I ask for part time 4 hour shifts and you show me full time 8+ hour shifts. | Love this app helped me so much from time to time give it a try if you haven‚Äôt | A good selection of jobs | Not able to receive money in meta 500.00 waiting for my bank what can I I do? | So far, it‚Äôs been easy to navigate | I‚Äôm finding full time janitorial jobs in my location but I‚Äôm not getting a response (needed phone number too)Keep up the good work | Awesome | If you asked me a year ago I would tell you apply for a job on indeed and you‚Äôll get about 3 of them. 

Update to the end of 2023 and so far 2024 I have an exceptional resume with a variety of experience yet Ive been unemployed and have not even heard back from most companies for almost 8 months..Ive been unemployed since august 2023 and not once have I even gotten close to getting a job‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt even respond‚Ä¶Ive have not even 5 interviews probably.

So Im not sure what exactly changed but I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time on here. Its very dis encouraging well to me at least. I‚Äôve also heard that a-lot of the postings are fake which I now 100% believe because no way NO ONE is hiring and yes I‚Äôve even applied for fast food and retail places thats how desperate I am for a job and still NOTHING!!! | Edit: I‚Äôve sent a few dozen applications via the easily apply option on the app.. only a handful have been viewed since. Most don‚Äôt even view them‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm qualified for these positions with some desirable experience actually‚Ä¶. / What‚Äôs the reason behind sending emails notifying me I didn‚Äôt get an interview? It‚Äôs incredibly demoralizing | I can‚Äôt apply to anything because it crashes halfway through the process.

Thanks for nothing. | ""I have had a bad experience with Indeed in the past. Although the app has great job opportunities, I have applied to more than 50 jobs in the last 4 months and have only received 4 follow-up emails. Unfortunately, 3 of them turned out to be scams. I ended up losing $200 to one of the scams, where I was asked to pay for shipping equipment but never received any equipment, nor my money back. The fourth company informed me that they had already received over 1000 applications. As a result of my experience, I have lost faith in the effectiveness of Indeed. I also reported the scam to Indeed, but the company responsible is still listed on their website."" | There are wayyy too many fake jobs on indeed. | This might be the worst designed job search I have used in 25 years. First.. they have introduced AI, but the algorithm is broken, if you key word search the system can't figure out one key word vs another. The whole skill test configuration is broken and some of the right answers are wrong, you can't exclude keywords and when you do, they still come up, and there's probably 15 scams per real job. Then you have remote job searches, that come back remote, but there not, or you have to define remote in the location, then remote in a drop down, then remote again in another drop down. Honestly, i have seen better designed applications as highschool projects. | Everytime I apply for jobs that they recommend I have potential or have quality experience, they never hire or even hire military veterans. Also I‚Äôve been on this indeed app since the last 3 years never been hired with all the experience and skills I have. Indeed is not worth you‚Äôre time. | They spam you and add a pause these emails button, when I went to click said button it needed two factor authentication 

Said the two factor authentication code was inaccurate when it was the exact one they sent 

Then when I got that done it actually would scramble the email after I typed it in and would not let me pause the emails | This was the best idea ever I love indeed, help me find a job | I give one star because there are a lot of job listings but I‚Äôve never got a job from this website. | Thanks Indeed for this service.  This removes so much anxiety to have a platform to quickly apply when life is so busy!  Job hunting can bring unwanted stress when it should be a blast and excitement filled due to life developing into a new field of possibility. This platform allows for that mindset!  Just remove the stalker calls and texts and emails.  Bad business‚Ä¶ my only complaint | La mejor aplicaci√≥n q hay , segura | Love indeed. | This app is okay? it used to have many different options for jobs now they just spam the same jobs over and over. | Reason: there‚Äôs no dark mode, not available for web and mobile app.. yes, people need this ASAP. | No jobs show up in the town you search so you change towns and it brings up jobs in your town. If you find a job and then close the app the job magically disappears even if you type it in word for word. Absolute trash! | Incredible | The app doesn‚Äôt save any preferences. So even if you don‚Äôt have the right qualifications for the job, it‚Äôll present it to you anyway. I spend more time on the app scrolling through job titles that in no way, shape or form relate to my credentials , just to possibly apply to one or two jobs within a 10 hour time span. This is the worst app | I know i‚Äôm not the only one having this issue but this app needs to be fixed. No where on my resume does it show i qualify to be a ER Nurse or anything like that.. SO WHY DO I KEEP SEEING THAT WHEN YOU GUYS RECOMMEND ME JOBS?? Please fix your app. | It‚Äôs good for the jobs but the app freezes too much | Too many jobs I‚Äôm not qualified for | I think indeed is the best job search site online.  It is indeed the best! | I had applied foe over 35 job mayority of  them even haven‚Äôt been reviewed yet i guess they need to work on there notification sistem | Very few of the jobs are legit. The ones that are real barely contact you back or you only qualify if you‚Äôve worked that same position before somewhere else. The ones that are fake get back to you extremely fast though which can get your hopes up but you need to be careful. they ask for any serious personal info, money, card information to pay you, or they send you a fake check that can literally destroy whatever credit you have and you will have to end up paying back double. I really needed a job and I was hopeful. I don‚Äôt even know if looking online for a job is worth it anymore.. | Every time I select the filters for my search, I get my filtered results on the first page but when clicking through to the next page the filters drop and it just shows you random jobs. Incredibly frustrating. | I get asked, Would I like to see the current job openings and after a Dozen Questions and me answering them, NO. I finally get to the listings and they are not what I am looking for . | Muy buenas es genial | Indeed has a lot of jobs but the only down fall I put in a lot of resumes and I haven‚Äôt got any hits yet I have with honest jobs for felons and there good jobs so I‚Äôll see in a couple days I don‚Äôt like to get noticed for a lot of jobs and no hits that‚Äôs very miserable for any one looking for a job good luck to any and all lookers thank u | I hope you guys keep the new update! I haven‚Äôt seen all of the features, yet. But so far, I love the fact that when I look at a job, it tells me how far it is from my home! That is literally so convenient; and it saves me time from having to go look it up in maps, lol. This feature really does make job searching easier for me! Thank you Indeedüòç. Please don‚Äôt remove the feature üôèüèº or I‚Äôll get angy | All you need is a decent resume and this app and you will find a job. They made it as easy as possible to connect with employers, and they are posting. Couldn‚Äôt recommend more. | This app went from being helpful, to a waste of time. I don‚Äôt appreciate having to take ‚Äúassessment‚Äù tests. Wasting 10 min of my time per application for nothing. You also now share my info and the app is full of recruiters or temp agencies that hide their company name. Thanks for giving employers a new way to skip an app and continue to be lazy in their hiring process. | With so many bugs and glitches and lack of job opportunities it seems like it's the same companys hiring for the same job on repeat yes I try to look for others but everything looks to be repeated I don't know if the company is that bad their constantly need to hire people or what | Dear developers, I love the app but it is extremely frustrating when the ‚Äústrengthen your profile‚Äù boxes pop up every single time I‚Äôm using the app, asking the same questions every time, again and again. It has asked my zip code 100 times, and I answer it accurately, 100 times. It asks about hours and other preferences, again and again. Every time I open the app, which is almost every day. Please eliminate this major issue! Thank you! | This app is a waste of time. I‚Äôve received nothing but scam inquiries from Indeed and regret giving them any of my information. Glassdoor and LinkedIn are sufficient for job searching and have a more user friendly UI imo. | This app is full of lies and people trying to steal your personal information, my bank account is froze, due to identification theft. Job postings are 90% not legitimate, Joe Biden wants it too seem like there are jobs! | Thank you üëèüèª | Show me my fckng score! I will not take any more assessments since I‚Äôm not shown my score. | Enjoy your better option for applying | If you use your email you will get like 100 emails per day from them",4.77494,2875632,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/41/76/54/417654c7-b0cc-a669-d53e-ff21db9d3cda/e89e3a92-6bcf-42c1-94da-27a28a2f6cc5_iOS_01a_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/00/1a/40/001a40c0-60f5-52c2-e825-16caf4ec2e1f/9176fe1b-5ced-4266-afb8-769e0208ed0a_iOS_02_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/c5/0e/2a/c50e2a45-7f09-6f39-f849-b31b2f93ad48/94fd2924-1f4d-405b-afa4-6689a30acb99_iOS_03_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3e/4e/f5/3e4ef59b-3075-9567-4ba7-51c90c1bdc6f/805eb151-c074-4a16-a034-ae8aaf141d21_iOS_04b_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9a/c0/56/9ac0563d-d989-5602-e3c7-d6b91ce1b50d/c9f16c4d-10ae-440a-a907-23db25f00291_iOS_05_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/c5/fc/25/c5fc256a-2d87-6028-34c2-c93e99a46e25/a1919d3d-38a5-4f94-bf64-a22cd300e41c_iOS_06_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/a9/ea/13/a9ea134c-4d34-da19-5b11-fe573381dd6f/d035b434-425d-4800-8f6b-6a2097b4e12c_iOS_07_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ce/d5/4a/ced54ab8-6ec9-b501-cf0a-d08b549cfc11/25da7240-9f9c-45ad-b9f9-fea1e7397d89_iOS_08a_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/bc/c4/dc/bcc4dcab-24cd-39f9-6dc7-c204582d35c7/4299e506-8d43-48c2-ac98-46083be2632c_iOS_01a_2048x2732.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/2c/7e/11/2c7e1192-0a29-4092-df09-e5c1b4e0267e/71915882-f580-4f8c-a642-f57b0badaecb_iPad_02_2048x2732.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0e/b7/b4/0eb7b486-4e49-665a-f1c8-6fde4ecc3b08/11c7fbb1-c4e2-4e36-b41c-56a84a24d352_iPad_03_2048x2732.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/86/61/ee/8661ee5f-63b7-b13e-8bad-44766521dc60/b3fba8a0-a46f-48e4-af40-8349f2898b0b_iPad_04b_2048x2732.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/15/8e/01/158e013b-0461-0daa-3b0e-b51968d75a9e/a5039bfc-5b8f-44b0-9d1d-877a25682a06_iPad_05_2048x2732.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b2/4c/fe/b24cfef0-21b1-f712-cb54-545a8e574bdc/d437f025-b9a8-4beb-bc66-a8c5ae743e97_iPad_06_2048x2732.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/81/b1/d9/81b1d9d3-a137-7e2a-d9ff-87e7438e6d63/a96658a4-1025-457e-b0bd-00e6f6ee1ca7_iPad_07_2048x2732.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1d/72/b4/1d72b4ec-0d2c-9420-7f6d-5c7524d635ec/a214ebdd-608a-428f-86be-f0fbc735c3cd_iPad_08_2048x2732.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPh

Excellent sound no break up talking halfway around the world for free. | It‚Äôs good ‚Ä¶. | I love this app because my best friend died at only 9 I‚Äôm 10 and she had a android phone so me and her talked about like 10h on the phone and I will miss her very much and while I am typing this I‚Äôm crying I will Miss you Nola and they put her on the news like let her die in peace but LLN=Live Long Nola      üò≠ü•πüòáüïäÔ∏èü§çRest in heaven | Good | Thanks this is a good app | I use this app to talk to my dad every day and my friends | My mother doesn‚Äôt have an iPhone but that does not stop us from seeing one another. This is awesome. | So good | chat box shouldn't cover screen while opening chat box . make it like a small window but it covers whole screen so while chatting cudnt see biology class üò≠üò≠ | Birthday dinner for me FaceTime mom | The calling qualities is really good | It‚Äôs really good, but it also buffers a lot and glitches a lot and sometimes my people can‚Äôt hear me but other than that it‚Äôs really really good | It ok | So I use google meat a lot but it won‚Äôt let me put my phone number in it keeps saying bad connection but I have a perfect connection and then I can‚Äôt ft bc it won‚Äôt go through | The call was good thank you so much google meet I love you google meet | Awesome | This app is the best app to call android to iPhones | It glitches sometimes but the rest is good | A lot of people are saying that the only way to get a good deal is to buy a house and buy a house in the next few years and then sell it for a year or two and then sell it for the next year or two to get a good deal on the market and then sell it for the same price as the market is going to be a lot of people are saying that is not true and that is a very good thing for the market right now and I think that is a good thing for the people to be buying it and I think it is a good thing for the company to be able to get a good price and I think it‚Äôs a good thing for the house and I think the market is going to be a good thing for the market is going to be a good thing for the market is going to be a good thing for the market is going to be a good thing for the market | Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep | I love google meet | The call quality is really good. There also are a lot of options to choose from for different backgrounds, videos, etc. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm not a good tech person, so some of these controls can be confusing to me. Overall amazing app!!! I love to be able to FaceTime with my friend who has a Samsung phone and so I can‚Äôt see her when we call but with google meet I definitely can! Love this appüòÑ | So good never had a glitch | Need iPad version also needs chat feature and sound quality has improved greatly since last update ‚òïÔ∏è | Always get good quality connections only lost connections once or twice probably on my end! But very good service! | Love it | It was glitchy during our call 
:( | I love it | Be careful what you wish for! | Ok so the app is bad because it kept hanging up when I was on the phone it kept I can‚Äôt hear anyone I can‚Äôt turn my phone down and let‚Äôs see what else it kept it. Can you let me see the person same of the other side of the phone what else what else and away I‚Äôm only 10 and it kept, yeah I couldn‚Äôt see anyone they couldn‚Äôt hear me. I couldn‚Äôt hear them cameras off his part is saying that I can‚Äôt see him. Yep that‚Äôs it so don‚Äôt buy this app it‚Äôs torture. Well it‚Äôs not torture but like it‚Äôs bad just don‚Äôt buy it.

Now I can‚Äôt even see my order properly with all the suggested items to buy. I get it, you have to sell stuff, but it‚Äôs becoming very annoying to use the app. Will probably have to switch to something else. Very disappointing | I had requested to change the size of my stamp after purchase when I realized what I had ordered was not the standard size and they gladly changed it but didn‚Äôt tell me they couldn‚Äôt refund me the difference in price. I would have liked to have known that before they went through with the change. | Love the new packaging !! its giving LUXURIOUS!! üî•üî•üî•üî• | Very convenient and easy to use | The product is great.  My only complaint isUPS Sure Post.  They are terrible. Get the address correctly and all would be fine.  I live in Tubac AZ and we have only a Post Office.  We are not in Tumacacori AZ. 
Over one month and second time I went online to order.  Site would not let me complete my order so each thing came in a separate box. 
Poor employees who type up invoices.  
They left off my Post Office Box. | Lleg√≥ el paquete a tiempo de acuerdo al monitoreo de la aplicaci√≥n gracias gracias gracias gracias | Shutterfly has done a travel mug with family pics for me, 3 mugs for me, my daughter and son-in-law with their beautiful little girl and my favorite a 10-inch book of photos of my precious granddaughter, plus a book of my daughter‚Äôs wedding 5 years ago. I love the ease of ordering photos and gifts from Shutterfly and will continue to do so. ‚ù§Ô∏è | Shop is the bestüòç | Great purchase. Love this bag. Quality at a good price. | I ordered two items the first came a few days after the order was placed. I waited for the other item for approximately two to three weeks before contacting customer service. I received the last item a few days after that.  No emails or anything to update on status.  No sure if I will continue using app. | The package was sent to my old address. When I realized it was sent to the old address, I went into your system and wrote a  Note with an address change.  I also tried to use the option call carrier. It did not let me call.  I have all of my mail being forwarded through the post office and this is the only package that was not forwarded. | I had two different orders, placed on the same day, but delivered to different places on 3/18 and I am yet to receive either. When tracking, one shows it was delivered, but it was not delivered to me. The Post Office seems to think they are double-assigning tracking numbers. I have emailed the company twice and gotten a ‚Äúcanned answer,‚Äù but no filters or my money returned. I called a number on the web site and got a totally different kind of business. I believe this to be a SCAM business, which is involved in fraudulent activity.  BEWARE!!! | Quick service and excellent updates to deliver . Love the necklace and it is perfect size to wear . | I wish shipping was so high I buy something that‚Äôs $18.00 and total is 30.00 give discounts or something to where I can keep ordering but also save money thank you | I love shop it is the best . | Amazing products very high quality definitely will purchase again | I think that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a nice app and I like their goals. I think there could be some improvements overall on their point system. | It‚Äôs very user friendly I would highly recommend this to anyone | I‚Äôm grateful to have received my purchases in a timely manner! Thanks a mil guys!! üñ§ | Nice t-shirt but stained from the packaging, I guess. | Best app to keep track of your packages, notifies you asap! | Live the app. I love it when stuff I buy automatically pre-populates and I love that I can add my own tracking numbers. What I do t love, is what evidently just happened (I use the app every day)‚Ä¶ is when they feel the need to give developers something to do and they arbitrarily change the user interface for no reason other than to confuse longtime users. There used to be a current orders option on the home page. Now you have to scroll through some to get to the ‚Äúsee all‚Äù option. It is not user intuitive and just seems a waste of time all around. Again‚Ä¶ love the app. I will het used to the change. I just hate change in an app just for the sake of change. It‚Äôs kinda dumb. | I love my Yes bow tie.   I have gotten many compliments on it. | Do you have anything available for veteran service dogs?  I will be training dogs for veterans with ptsd. Thanks, Sandy | My order was placed on Shop the money was withdrawn from my account a receipt showed on Shop and I haven‚Äôt been able to get any other information. I haven‚Äôt received a shipping alert or email. My package should have arrived two business days ago. I tried to get information from Shop on MyHala Pantry with no success with little information, only a order number! Really alarming! I am hoping this is abnormal but I don‚Äôt think so. HELP!

Review update: Even less help than you could imagine, Shop response shows they do not vet their stores , but pass on unscrupulous information! Horrible,  they are not worthy of the one star! I had to go to the App Store to make contact with Shop. The My Halal Pantry is still on site with no real way to contact them on their fake website and email! How about looking at My Halal‚Äôs website Shop and see for yourself? | Such a great app. From buying items to tracking all my packages such a great app. Special discounts and you earn cash back just for using them | Beautiful Quiet Very Cute Comes with lots of extras will order soon | Shop told me package was delivered ‚Äútwo  hours ago‚Äù.  Not there! Was it stolen? Panic.  Called vendor who told me the item had not even shipped yet.  He was looking right at it.  Bad shop! | I have been trying to contact this company since I received the order as it does not fit correctly and I‚Äôve sent 3 emails with no response at all!! Poor customer service if I could give zero stars I would! | Love the app and that it aggregates all my packages but lately I'm being prompted to re-link my Amazon account nearly every time I open the app. Couldn‚Äôt find how to contact you directly to raise a ticket but worth exploring the bug. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great app to use. | I downloaded this app to help me keep track of when different packages would arrive. With the latest update, that list takes up a very tiny amount of real estate and takes multiple swipes for me to reach the page where I can view all of them. Instead the app is hardcore pushing shopping in the app, which I‚Äôm not interested in (and has not been a great experience in the app). I‚Äôm currently looking for other apps that will better focus on package tracking. | The fabric in this outfit is high quality and is so soft! My little one isn‚Äôt yet crawling but I can assume it will have great durability with the fabric thickness. I have bought a few things from this shop and the colors are just as pictured too, which I appreciate. You won‚Äôt be disappointed with this cute print! | Took forever to ship and the packaging looks generic with no SleepGuarding branding. Experience felt cheap for the price. | No tengo idea cuando llegar√° mi orden | Turned out amazing!!very impressed!! It came quick,my fianc√© loved it!!! | App is a scam. I ordered a cologne for a really good deal then when I went back to the store it was deleted. This place is full of scammers and they wont take any action to give me my money back | They used to provide order updates for Shopify integrated stores pretty easily. Now it‚Äôs buried in the ux so deep I couldn‚Äôt even find it. Revenue chasing takes precedence over usability. Not a good look. | 5,reasons no to buy

1.took forever to receive 
2.cheapest fabric ,it was literally un-stitching when I received it.
4. I tried to return no one ever reach out to me (Returm policy was a Fraud)
5. Waste of my money save yours üòû | They took my money and never received my product do not buy anything from them | I‚Äôve looked for 2 months to find this parka in a large size. I couldn‚Äôt believe that I found it with your company. The parka is very nice and I‚Äôm glad you had it in my size and color!!! | They fit perfect! Fast delivery, great workmanship. Will be buying more. | Thank you so much as I love my hat and shirt. Hat fits perfectly and quality material. I love the shirt with Mission of Hope in back. Again thank you. | Tenis originales
No esperaba nunca los detalles!! Gracias! Por mi 120% 

Gracias de nuevo | It has been 5 days still Order place????? 
I would say the tracking is really bad and it‚Äôs not right thing they are showing up but still I love the app!  I‚Äôm just impatient I thought it was a scan still I‚Äôm here waiting 4 my package | Llego rapido y en buen estado. Gracias!! | I purchased a certain name brand as advertised and received something else in a much smaller version. Horrible. | I started using this app roughly two years ago. Great.

Don‚Äôt know what happened but people are paying for this and it needs to be fixed. | I have enjoyed Hulu since 2009. I‚Äôve attempted to update my payment method on multiple devices and in multiple browsers, alas to no avail. I‚Äôve chatted with support staff and their instructions do not result in success. Perhaps I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

Nevertheless, I‚Äôve never encountered a company that makes it so difficult to give them money. I‚Äôll stop trying, as it‚Äôs proven a waste of time. Goodbye! | This last update for iPad is terrible, can‚Äôt watch half my shows now. Most of my recorded shows aren‚Äôt showing up anymore. But if I use the web browser version everything is how it should be. Might be time for a change | Hulu has gone drastically downhill. I pay $105/month after taxes for ‚Äúad free‚Äù live tv. Of course there is fine print saying some shows may have minimal ads. The majority of shows I watch have ads and minimal is not the word I would use. Two to three minute ads every ten minutes of show is ridiculous when I‚Äôm paying $105. Anything from CBS, NBC, and most other networks has these ads when streaming. It‚Äôs absurd! Very few shows are ad free. | This is the WORST app EVER | I select the show and episode I want to watch and when turn the phone into landscape to watch, the app randomly starts a different show | Constantly I run into bugs during or after ads show. No audio on my show, it doesn‚Äôt save my timestamp, etc. There is as well way too many. Once when I was watching a show and ads come on the show time was still running out, and skipped over a minute of my show which when I went back over played more ads and glitched out again. Don‚Äôt even try exiting and re-entering because then it will either skip to the next episode or start over the one you were watching. | You might as well get Netflix. On the Hulu app you literally can‚Äôt go back to watch a part you may have missed or want to rewatch without having to watch all the commercials again - they need to hire new app developers. And honestly everything on Hulu that‚Äôs worth watching you can find elsewhere. The commercials are sooo depressing too like honestly screw Hulu. Makes shows and movies so unenjoyable. | Crushes a lot, but will show full add no matter what. | The ads don‚Äôt load correctly now and I can‚Äôt watch anything. Also please remove Hulu from Disney+. It‚Äôs not needed or wanted. | Would not let you cancel subscription it‚Äôs a robbery | I hate seeing all of the shows and movies that I‚Äôve hidden or disliked from Hulu show up on my Disney plus! Should have an option to opt out of the merger! | Yall are cheapskates adding all these ads and still making us pay for the subscription üòÇ | It‚Äôs it wild how the app can slowly run worse and worse, and on top of that they decide they want more money so charge more on on top making money off running advertisements. And then try to ask of EVEN MORE money from you to get rid of ads. And you‚Äôll probably do it too, hulus ads are somehow even worse than cable television or even YouTube, you‚Äôre going to spend probably 20 minutes watching ads trying to get through a 30 minute episode. Absolutely wild. | This app is the worst app I‚Äôve ever downloaded. I don‚Äôt know why they have sports live on the go because you can‚Äôt never see it clearly. I done with Hulu | honestly i dont really use the app for hulu much except for when i download episodes to watch for later and somehow they all mysteriously get deleted. they didn't expire cause i literally just downloaded them and i have a lot of space left. the only way i can get it to work sometimes is when i delete the app and reinstall it but even then it doesn't always stay. its so frustrating and i never know if i will or won‚Äôt have my shows later. | I will gladly pirate anything from this embarrassment of a streaming platform | When I attempt to use picture-in-picture mode while watching something I am able to for about 30 mins before the app crashes. Whatever I am watching completely disappears from picture-and-picture and I then have to go back into the app and find the show again. Its extremely frustrating as other streaming devices never do this. | You cannot turn Auto-play off on a kids profile which is ridiculous because that is the main profile it needs to be able to be turned off on. Just spent thirty minutes on a chat with a representative and they exhausted all of their strategies to solve the problem. This is an issue on both the iOS app and the Apple TV app. Hulu I have no issues with your content and prefer you over other streaming services, please resolve this issue. Thanks | FIX YALL DAYUM STREAM SERVER | Worst app. 1) keeps logging out
2) every 2months, a connectivity issue
3) audio dies
4) doesn‚Äôt have all the episodes in a series | Imagine paying for a streaming service right and it doesn‚Äôt do the one thing you pay it to do crazy right | If I wanted commercials I would have just stayed with dish-tv. This is ridiculous! There are 4 commercials that are a minute and half long each and if I want to rewind I need to watch a 3min commercial before continuing. 

You want us to pay the same price for Hulu that does not have commercials as the price for dish-tv. | 10 dollars for ad free ! Glad to cancel | Okay, I‚Äôm exaggerating; it actually works about 5% of the time. I‚Äôve tried everything. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled it so many times I can do it it my sleep. Still no joy. Thankfully it‚Äôs a freebie (and that‚Äôs still paying too much). | they don‚Äôt deserve even 2 start.. base on there app I can have 1 month free trial but when I subscribe they charged me imminently so I contact there customer service and they said they just have a app problem so now they will refund my money, but no after 3 days I ask them again and they said they just have misunderstanding they can‚Äôt refund my money due to 3rd party I should contact Apple to refund but of course it‚Äôs been 3 days so Apple won‚Äôt refund my subscription so now they keep forcing me to used the app or report this refund issue to my bank so of course more waste of time.. THIS APP IS REALLY A SCAM | Yeah hulu is alright and all it didnt tell me that I had a subscription so when I went to buy something it said ‚Äúpayment failed‚Äù I‚Äôm really mad because I really wanted that stuff. And it didnt let me refund. And $17?! Way too much like I could‚Äôve bought a whole McDonald‚Äôs meal with that money. Can hulu tell us when we have a subscription? That is why i give a one starüíÄüíÄüíÄ | The battery drains quick using the Hulu app. There is also way too many ads. An absurd amount. I can‚Äôt wait until I finish my show so I can cancel Hulu. | You pay a monthly subscription and they run ads every 5 minutes | Bro fix y‚Äôall shi | This app has an issue loading videos and even loading the app itself. I have to close the app completely and reopen it multiple times while I am watching a show. It also gets stuck sometime during commercials and will not close so I have to turn my phone off completely. | If you want a great example of the greed that ruins this world, Hulu is a prime example. You subscribe to watch the movies they have, but you are then required to pay extra for the movie you want to watch. Be better, (Netflix 5stars) | Every time I try to resume a movie or show, it starts from the beginning. This has been going on forever. How is this not fixed yet? | Add a skip intro already! And stop randomly LOGGING me out!!! | Why rec not has not been nine months very very poor app . | Why subtitles are delayed? | I don‚Äôt mind watching ads but when there is an ad every 5 minutes it makes it hard to even watch your show. | Hands down the worst streaming service for devices. When you are not ad-free the ads constantly slow down, mess up, or otherwise interrupt your viewing experience. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times having ads would have Hulu skip over entire minutes of the show I was watching or would completely stop the show for whatever reason. If you have the chance do not get Hulu and definitely do not pay for ads. I‚Äôm convinced these bugs are intentional to make you so frustrated that you feel so annoyed, so you pay for ads. If I could give less than a 1 star review I would. | The app consistently crashes my iPad 8th Gen with the new iOS update version. | There are plenty of shows I like to watch on Hulu and I have the ad free version. But this app has SO many other issues. The sound always gets off so it doesn‚Äôt line up with the picture. I have to stop it and go back to the show. But! When I do that I won‚Äôt find the show under continue watching and even if I do, every time I hit resume playing, it starts at the beginning of the show and I have to fast forward. I cannot watch this app when going to bed because the sound for music and sound effects is super loud and voices very quiet. I‚Äôve tried changing tv settings that didn‚Äôt work but this is also the only app that has these issues. I kinda hate it, but I fight through to watch some shows.
For all of those having all of the ad issues, when I had ads and that happened to me, I‚Äôd exit out of the show and back in and then you don‚Äôt have to watch any ads at all, just do it for every ad break!! | Worthless parental controls. Autoplay is off, but it still autoplays. Can't hide stuff I don't pay for. Just show me what I CAN watch. --- Adding a live tv channel to favorites is convoluted at best. If I can't do all the tv stuff from the AppleTV remote, you've failed. -- apple tv remote stops responding on live tv. Force quit, continues to play for several seconds. | I don‚Äôt like all the ads üëéüèº | For every three minutes of your show you watch five minutes of advertisements.  This app has an advertisement problem.  You literally spend more time watching advertisements than the show you stream. | I think you should at least put one add every episode because every 10 minutes I have to watch a stupid ad no one wants to watch and | The Hulu app is complete garbage.  It rarely works and when it does, it will periodically log you out and then claim you don‚Äôt have an account.  I HATE HATE HATE the Hulu app.  They should fire their entire development team and start over. | Come on Hulu.

Money moves quickly - directly from bank account to bank account. If your bank or credit union offers Zelle, you already have it in your mobile banking app or online banking ‚Äì if they don‚Äôt, the Zelle app will make it easy for you to send money to enrolled Zelle users that already have access through their financial institution.
Zelle. This is how money moves¬Æ.
Using just your recipient‚Äôs email address or U.S. mobile number, you can settle up simply and safely with almost anyone you know and trust. Even better, Zelle does not charge any fees to use the service. (Mobile carrier or bank fees may apply).
GET STARTED:
1.	Download the Zelle app.
2.	Enroll using a Visa¬Æ or Mastercard¬Æ debit card linked to a U.S. checking account; or 
3.	Enroll your U.S. checking account by using your online banking username and password, if your bank supports this feature*.
4.	Choose a person to pay, or request money from, by entering their U.S. mobile number or email address.
5.	Confirm the amount and hit send. If they‚Äôre already enrolled with Zelle, they‚Äôll typically get the money in minutes. If they aren‚Äôt, they will be notified and can follow a few simple steps to complete the payment. 

*Some banks allow customers to enroll in the Zelle app using their online or mobile banking username and password.

They use the fact that it‚Äôs an instant transfer that can‚Äôt be reversed to scam people! Stay away from this app! Not worth getting scammed over it! The fact that it links directly to your bank account through their app is very sketchy! Apple needs to shut down this app now!!! | The app takes way too long to open up so I can send the money. | My money on on clip | Hello Zelle team Kindly work to make you Zelle app to be received payment rolling accept Account number and routine number to be receive payment manually | I was expecting it to function like all the other pay apps where you just enter her name and it sends money or you enter a request. It sends money and then shows you activity. In fact, all it does is route me to the bank and has me do the transaction at the bank. | Why I used Zelle:
I was organizing and paying for soccer sessions with friends and needed to collect money from the people that played. I normally use Venmo but some people only had Zelle so I needed to use it. 

Phone Restricted:
A few people sent their fair share and next thing I know is my account was restricted. I called to figure out what was going on. That was a struggle by itself - calls take a long time to get connected, sometimes got cut with no explanation. 

Their Explanation:
They finally answered and connected me with the right people. They put me on hold to look into my account and then asked why I use Zelle. I explained that it‚Äôs for sending and receiving money with friends. They looked some more and got back to me that my account is restricted for violating terms of use. I was surprised but not concerned because I usually use Venmo. I laughed and asked why. She told me that it‚Äôs all in the terms of use and that she knows how weird it is. 

Deleted it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | Unable to even sign in without it taking 5 minutes to load up. If it would even let you sign in‚Ä¶ error codes every button pressed and have to close the application and cross your fingers that it works | ü§™ü§™ | My banking app updated and isn‚Äôt offering Zelle for at least a week and I really need to transfer money but Zelle‚Äôs own app just keeps redirecting me to my banking app. Super inconvenient if your bank app is down and you need to send money. Now I have to go withdraw cash and drive across town to give it to someone because this app doesn‚Äôt do anything besides tell you to use another app. | Excelente | I‚Äôve tried to login several times with wifi and with just my mobile data and it will not let me do anything. Useless. | Apparently, if you have a problem logging in and the 2nd level support can not help. My son received an error message trying to log in to our account and called 2nd level support. They wouldn‚Äôt speak to him so I had to get involved. BUT! Because they did not believe who I was and their system could not pull up anything to verify my existence I have been blocked from using Zelle. 

Of course there are no supervision reps available to assist further. I now have to wait up to 2 days to possibly get a call back from management. 

This is not the way to run a business. I would understand being locked out if I could not verify the questions put to me. But to not be able to ask me a question for verification from their end is not an issue I should be blamed for. 

Unfortunately, I am now locked out of my account, I can‚Äôt verify previous payments, make payments, or receive payments from Zelle. I now have to use another app to make payments to vendors I have been paying for years with Zelle. Some vendors accept nothing but Zelle so I am stuck mailing checks. 

Oh, and I was told I can‚Äôt use the same phone number or bank account information on a new account through Zelle. What am I supposed to do, change my phone number and change banks?

Me and my friends use it all the time, if you need to get money to someone asap, then zelle is for you!  Zelle-keep up the good work. | The current app has a major bug where you 1) cannot scan your debit card to sign up because the app cannot even sync with your phone camera‚Äôs auto focus, and 2) can‚Äôt register a debit card (necessary to sign up in the first place) even after you enter all your information properly. Incredibly disappointing for an app that‚Äôs supposed to be a Venmo and Cashapp competitor. I‚Äôm on an iPhone 15 Pro for reference.

Now I will delete it and use competitors apps | I love the simplicity of this app. | How is your money protected against scammers? | Can‚Äôt login anymore it just has a red bar at the bottom that says there is an error and gives me a error code of a106 and this continues to happen and has been happening for a while.

Apparently lending money to friends in need is a terminable act of service utilizing this app. When calling to understand why my account has been restricted there was no reasonable explanation provided. | Zelle is the best app to transfer money immediately | Since security policies have changed I have been unable to use the app or pay my rent using this app. | Perfecci√≥n de app | This app just redirects me to my banking app and has no other function? | App is slow and lags up | Sad face | App never lets me sign in, always just a spinning wheel and then times out. | Hay alg√∫n problema con la aplicaci√≥n? No he podido entrar desde ayer | The worst! Have to be on WiFi. Can never login when not on wifi and even when on WiFi it takes forever to login. | Most of the time the app doesn‚Äôt open!!! It‚Äôs very frustrating when trying to send or request funds that are needed immediately! | The loading on Apple devices is horrendous! At times it loads with a breeze but 90% of the time it loads slower than the old internet explorer. I also got sent money and I'm told to apply to zelle even though I already have an account. The app is great but the loading is just annoying especially if you‚Äôre trying to do it immediately. | Takes FOREVER to log you in. | App won‚Äôt even open and won‚Äôt link with any of my cards or banks. Enjoy the free $12 I can‚Äôt collect | Unfortunately every time I try to login the app times out and won‚Äôt open my account. | I‚Äôm so frustrated with how long Zelle takes to log me in. No matter my internet speeds I‚Äôm sitting there at least a couple of minutes every time. That can‚Äôt happen in 2024. Get it together | Can‚Äôt get into the app to use it! Keeps loading! | i‚Äôm not sure why i don‚Äôt see any reviews addressing this but i literally cannot stand using Zelle due to the amount of time it takes to sign in and send money. Why am i sitting here refreshing and staring at my phone for 5 minutes while the wheel is spinning? I have to refresh the app costantly and that doesn‚Äôt help most of the time. on top of that, you‚Äôre limited to sending only $500 a week | I can‚Äôt even log into the account. 
If the app ever works, I‚Äôll give a better review | I tried to use this app. When I put in my mobile number, it just scrolls and scrolls. Nothing happens. I uninstalled and reinstalled- still just scrolls. | What is wrong with Zelle?

Unfortunately I‚Äôm locked into an annual subscription through apple that I can‚Äôt get a refund for even though I‚Äôve cancelled the sub. | Bluey has a sex episode called The Sign. Maybe you were like ‚ÄúDuh, hey, lets give Bluey a episode with sex.‚Äù | I am a HUGE Marvel fan. The fact that they put all the movies in timeline order is SO HELPFUL for binge watching the series. I also like how it has its own section very helpful. | Ummmmmmmmmm | i‚Äôve been using disney since it came out and i feel like the only shows that are entertaining i‚Äôve watched a billion times!!üò£i need you to add more shows disney, the ones that are entertaining. PLEASE üôèüèº i‚Äôm gonna switch to netflix

also i get logged out a lotüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è | The simple fact that you can‚Äôt clear a show from your watch history, makes this app bad. Every other streaming service has figured this out. If you start a show or movie you don‚Äôt like, you‚Äôre stuck with it until you watch or fast forward through the entire thing. Add in the fact that you can‚Äôt rate anything, just makes for a bad app. Disney has a lot of good programs. They need to step up their game with the app. | It‚Äôs because my cousin i enjoying himself by watching Toy Story! | Disney is overall a good app to install but on a show called Bluey Disney got rid of something‚Äôs that are questionable but fine but overall a good app to install | This is more of a bug report/feature request than a review - the search function in the app is a pain in the butt and genuinely makes it difficult to browse Disney+‚Äôs library. I‚Äôm guessing the devs are utilizing lazy loading to prevent the app from significantly slowing down, however when it loads more it forces the view to the top of the page, forcing me to scroll down again. If this was fixed it would encourage me to explore the library a lot more, as it stands it‚Äôs a needless roadblock in an otherwise functional app. | Quality is good everything is perfect. I can watch all my favorite shows on there. Everything is so good. | . | I love it so much | Muy pero muy buena tienen que hacer 2 parte | I love Disney, and as someone who grew up with Disney I know there are films missing on it, and I‚Äôm begging for you to put the ‚Äò house of mouse‚Äô specials on it! Specifically The Halloween house of mouse! | I love how you can go on offline mode, it‚Äôs perfect on the go and on the airplane to still watch your favorite shows. Great quality, there‚Äôs loads of options and collections, movies, & shows to choose from! I also like to look at the ‚ÄúRecommended for You‚Äù section, it helps me find a new enjoyable show. Thanks Disney! | The goat. | Good chat Skibidi sigma Ohio alpha males | This app has movies that other apps don‚Äôt have this app is really good and appropriate for kids. | I think Disney + is great. | I don‚Äôt have kids of my own but it‚Äôs started to get crazy what they are adding on here like Grimcutty which is ironic since it hid in kid videos to tell kid to off their parents and sewer slide 
American horror stories is on there which we all know a whole level of a tv series on its own there just to name two specifically the entire season on on there
When the app came out it went to kids and family Disney cartoon/movie release now it‚Äôs making me concern for kids just to go on there on their own I‚Äôm genuinely bothered by it especially since Disney a comfort place 
Only doing 5 stars so this will be seen and heard 
Definitely make sure you have restriction if you don‚Äôt want your kids to watch these | It has all of my favorite movies and shows and it just added Hulu | Pls out of all things 
time to update when I‚Äôm doing it. It‚Äôs not letting me | I use to be able to be on the app all the time but now it won‚Äôt even let me log in!! Let alone work but it works perfectly fine on my tv. | This is the most boring thing | Disney is the best because it provides a variety of movies and shows. Disney also has the best WiFi when I am traveling.
-Karenisha Scott | This is a great app | It won‚Äôt accept the password. Absolute trash. Reset password 3 times. | Y | i used to LOVE disney+ and would use it all the time. but now after hulu was added all we get is ads. ads literally every episode multiple times. not only that, but i used to love that adult shows weren't on disney but not after hulu being added, young kids have easy access to adult content. i am not happy. | Better than before. | I say nothing is better because it does not take that long to login to it it has good shows  it is ever better then Netflix (witch takes so long to login to) so nothing is better. | I get it, you want money and all but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to make the best shows cost money like let me watch my favorite shows for free instead of going on apps that don‚Äôt meet the product. | I love this app soooo much! My only complaint is that PG stuff instant on kids mode but hey we could probs fix that! Thank you Disney crew!!!!!! | My family and I absolutely adore Disney+ and everything it offers! There is so much variety, and plenty of family-friendly shows and movies to watch together. Definitely recommend this app to anyone and everyone! | It is brings back memories of my childhood and thank you for sharing my all of memories with me it means a lot to me and do you happy dreams sometimes you can feel different things about yourself think about what you dream about what you‚Äôre to be when you grow up to process or price or king or queen that is what who you are and that is my message to everyone all of you you are not alone and you have dreams love and hope and happiness don‚Äôt forget go chase dreams love and happiness and hope don‚Äôt give it up you will always have dreams and future. Think about good things and never think about bad things or even mistake madness choose evil or good good always wins | Ads are longer then the shows. Disgusting experience. | I really like this app because we can watch new stuff and then my lil sister loves this app too_!_ | After Hulu was combined into the Disney+ App and they did the update, it‚Äôs been so difficult to browse movies. It‚Äôs no problem if I know exactly what I want to watch and search it. But if I‚Äôm not sure and want to browse through the movies on the app on my phone and IPad, it‚Äôs so frustrating. I‚Äôll start to scroll through the titles and (for example, I can only get to the beginning of the ‚ÄúC‚Äù titles) and it refreshes back to the beginning. I can never get past a few rows down‚Ä¶ Is there any way it can be fixed? | Disney is supporting the murder of children in palestine. Do NOT give them money if you can. | Disney + did an update recently and I no longer have the option on the iPhone app to resume my movies and TV shows where I left off. The commercials are annoying, but having to watch 2 mins of commercial and then scrub through my 2 1/2 hr movie to find where I left off, to watch more commercials again, is extremely frustrating! | Griffin | I remember when it was $6.99 for a month with no adds a year or so ago, now it‚Äôs double $13.99. 
That is absolutely ridiculous. I love Star Wars but Disney is ruining it and charging us outrages prices to watch mediocre shows. | i Love this | OK so I love the app and it would be five stars, but I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has this problem with your watchlist. It only shows you a portion of it. It won‚Äôt show me my whole watchlist and the only pop up something from my list, if I delete or show from my watchlist. Now I know it‚Äôs there because if I search for the movie it‚Äôll show it‚Äôs my watchlist, but I can‚Äôt find it there. It‚Äôs really weird. | Glare is killing me in theater mode | I have a Disney+ subscription through iTunes and I can open it up on my iPhone, or Apple TV just fine and watch anything I would like to watch. However, when I open this app on my iPad, it always asks me to login. The iPad app does not connect to the Settings subscription. I can look inside the settings of my iPad and I can see that I am subscribed to Disney+ but the stupid application doesn‚Äôt recognize it. Give me a break. I‚Äôm not getting a second account just for my iPad. | Somethings i wish things stayed original and not forced to change due to this generation. | I don‚Äôt like the addition of Hulu content to the Disney+ app it made an already congested scroll even worse. On top of that shows that are inappropriate for my Disney Junior age kids are shown all over the platform in the KIDS profile. The ability to block titles and further adjust the content ratings would be really helpful. | I think disney is great i love watching it but it will never compare to Netflix its a great influense on other kids. |

UnicornDiva | Well I can say I will ship here now,where I wouldn't before...you're doing great. | Muy buena app | No good delivery | Good | Items have been as described. Shipping is usually late. Ali gives $1 coupons for late orders but only allows one coupon per order. Very petty policy. | Great place to buy. | Bueno me gusta | ÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ | Tr√®s bonne application | But Pretty can‚Äôt wait to install it now. I have to find another breeder because they took so long. | I had problems paying for the items in the app and had to purchase them one at a time and be charged for each one . Plus orders would disappear on trying to make a payment but customer service helped me resolve the issue  the app needs work . | Super bien | It‚Äôs way faster then TikTok shop and better quality | Isn‚Äôt a bad app yall should download it if you don‚Äôt have it | It‚Äôs a good store but I wish their items would come faster | This is my to go to find things that I need excellent app ,way a little bit for the parts or the items I order but I highly recommend it good place to shop | Love their stuff and prices thank you again | Good app | Addicted to this app no joke | Estoy muy contenta con los productos que he comprados | Nicely laid out and generally intuitive...

The sound quality is over the top! | Love this app I find great deals and have had only 1 issue with a seller and they corrected it immediately! | Its very easy and cheap and delivers fast. | Love | Now my go to website for watches. Very good deals and excellent communication. | I buy a lot and every order has been beautiful. Well made ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | I recently ordered from this company and was happy with my purchase. It came to me in a timely manner but then this morning I wake up and they tried to charge me for VIP and I did not order. VIP sure I looked at it, but I did not confirm no purchase, then I tried to delete my account. It would not let me delete my account because of the bogus VIP charge spent an hour wasted trying to get my account deleted talking to support. They can‚Äôt understand 90% of anything I type and there is no way to delete your card info on the app buyer beware!!!!!!! | Love it | I‚Äôm only giving it a 4 star because Ali express needs to rectify the whole issue of not allowing you people to pay and deducting money, all it‚Äôd say is order expired or order cannot be placed, that‚Äôs really bad and it‚Äôs the only issue they have. Kindly rectify that for all account! | The staff customer service really good always talking with me, I like bought stuff at AliExpress | Love is!!!

For example: if I am looking at a hanger there is an option to select hangers << closet storage << storage and organization etc. this way I can see where the item is originally found and similar products. | Don‚Äôt use safari to just use the app to verify things. All these extra steps for what? | It was working ok til the recent update that I can‚Äôt get my target points from the latest receipt scans | After I put things in my cart and have viewed my cart I would like to continue shopping and it‚Äôs not an obvious option. Would like to see a ‚Äúcontinue shopping‚Äù button. 
Thanks | The app is so much better now, cuz now I don‚Äôt have to go into the store and spend more money‚Ä¶oh wait that‚Äôs not the apps doing that‚Äôs due to the self checkout being 10 items or less | I was expecting my order to be delivered today and when I checked to see what time it would be delivered, I found Target had canceled my order!!!  I received no notification and now I don‚Äôt have a rug for patio this weekend when we are having people over!!! | Never have a problem and I can always find what I‚Äôm looking for. Like that it tells me what aisle to find everything. | Me encanta todo lo que venden sus marcas son muy buenas.
Los precios son accesibles 
Todo esa en orden 
Lo que busco lo encuentro 
Doy 100 de 100 | App is a little frustrating because it changes the delivery method and store on me frequently even when I have it set at the beginning. | One of the best and user friendly online shopping sites I‚Äôve found! üëçüèº | I‚Äôm hoping to see you that I bought right now is not broken because the time that I bought some two CD for Taylor soup the city it‚Äôs broken so tomorrow I had to return it in the store because it‚Äôs broken the glass. Please make sure to send it to the right apartment thank you. | $1 fee for every order is ridiculous | Love this app & the convenience of picking my order up in 2 hours ‚ù§Ô∏è | For the app and the site, the search functions are broken because they do not show results.  The app gives error messages, and the site shows a blank page.  Happens all the tome | W | Leave me alone, why do you have to take advantage of the same delivery channel for order notifications to spam? Y‚Äôall are getting to be worse than Walmart, and that‚Äôs saying something‚Ä¶. | I like Target and shop there often. The app used to have a relatively smooth user interface and was often the easiest shopping app on my iPhone. I used to be able to pay my RedCard by navigating a simple few keys. After the update, that‚Äôs no longer possible‚Äî not from my phone. When I press ‚Äúmanage my RedCard‚Äù it glitches out and takes me to a blank screen. Paying and managing my card should have been made easier (w/ just face id like the wallet feature?) ‚Ä¶ now it‚Äôs not. Please fix all these update glitches. | The app won‚Äôt let me past finding a store in my area. It just gets stuck there and won‚Äôt populate any store near me or in my state. 
When I switch devices. It tells me it can‚Äôt find any items. When I try to go to the web it constantly redirects me to the app where I can‚Äôt do anything! Frustrating!! | Target you‚Äôre the best | Thank you | For several days the app forgets my password and presents this unfriendly message. 
{""error"":""Access Denied"",""code"":""FORBIDDEN""}
Otherwise I love the app and use it daily. | Very high speed app. Graphics explain things nicely. One of easiest apps I‚Äôve ever seen! | I paid extra to have delivered today and said items were in stock and they were not | I can‚Äôt believe how much time I save using the drive up feature. I‚Äôm so happy that Target has the amazing service!!! | The app has so many amazing features and they're so easy to use. I can filter a search by store, i can do a mix of delivery and pick up, pick up is always 2 hours or less unlike whole foods pick up which makes you pick a time for grocery pick up and even charges for priority time, and when you get to the screen, the time you want is unavailable. Allows apple pay which is big for me, easy to find and reorder things. Easy to apply savings and coupons. Has a map of each store so i can actually find the isle it says the item is in. And finally, Target's commitment to accessibility and device feature integration lives up to and exceeds expectations.. Love love love shopping in this app and consider it a model for what a capable and accessible shopping app should be. Great job target! | Prices of items are too, too high! | Trying to pay my bill and not able to because I can‚Äôt get to ‚ÄúManage my Red Card.‚Äù I don‚Äôt understand why this had to change‚Ä¶. I need my physical card now which I don‚Äôt have, to ‚Äúsign up‚Äù to pay my bill (!)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. | I loved racking up my reward earnings. I can‚Äôt believe you guys took that away. It‚Äôs just 1% of what we spend as customers to come back and spend again. I like that discounts are applied automatically but almost every store has a points and rewards system for shopping there. | I love how easily you can understand everything on the app and find everything so quick! | I had the Target app for a very long time then ran into problems with it.  I am now trying to reinstall the app but when I login I can‚Äôt get past the choose a store page.  I type in my zip code , tried my city and state but all I get is a blank page.  I can‚Äôt go further (no option) and I can‚Äôt go back(again no option) so the only option is to close the app.  I am using an IPhone 15 pro latest IOS version. | Thanks for the timeliness | I used to religiously do drive up on this app probably 2-3 times a week to get items I needed and not have dean with crowds. Im not sure what happened but at some point in October the app stopped me from being able to do drive up and in store pick up and the only way to do this service is by going to their web browser website. Its no longer easy and convenient. Which this has lead me to shop elsewhere. I do wish they do reinstate drive up via app. | I love  their drive up service! It has changed my life! I love that I‚Äôm a no show inside the Store! | Love Target they never disappoint. Selection and quality is fantastic. They are hip and current on the trends. 

My only feedback is the shopping carts in the Phoenix area are disgustingly dirty. Obviously because there is not any rain. Get the managers to buy power washers and clean them up. They are nasty. | The new updates to the app has made it annoying to navigate. I‚Äôm not sure why the app has changed, the old version of it was 100x better. If it‚Äôs not broken why fix it type of thing here. | It wasn‚Äôt easy to do a reorder. It asked for same delivery or pickup options only. The item chosen could only be shipped. I figured it out but it was complicated. User testing would fix some of the issues. | I love this app so much! The easiest UI and the most efficient processes, I love the convenience. | I wish Target would allow a credit application for their Target Mastercard, instead of only being invited by being a Store Only RedCard Holder first. I would of done a lot more shopping at target if I had one card I could use everywhere. But that is just my option on that. Otherwise Target is Great! | I received a $200 gift card‚Ä¶ I ordered $40.70 worth of product this morning. And it will not let me place the order. It shows on my app that it has subtracted that from my $200 and shows my balance. 
I have been on the phone with Target for over 40 minutes I believe may be more‚Ä¶ With seven different people I believe. I had to call back once because I was on hold for so long. It was ridiculous. So the second call was was over 40 minutes I believe. Regardless, it‚Äôs been a very frustrating morning over $40.70.
I will ask for gift cards again. They are way too much work.
although the seven people I spoke with were kind ‚Ä¶ I was very frustrated and upset. | Love the service. | Easy and Free! | Please fix this | Only issue I have is that it signs me out on occasion but other than that I love it and it helps me save money | Did drive up and had several missing items as well as a smushy cucumber | Love everything about target and all the options we have to shop! I love how accurate the app is in regard to what‚Äôs in stock and location of items when shopping in the store. The customer service is also the best and always helpful! Just wish shipping here was still free. | When you put something on clearance, it really should be for a lower price and you could get it on sale. 10% off is not clearance. You may be clearance because you‚Äôre not getting it back in, but that is not a clearance price.

Furthermore, when you know you don‚Äôt have and won‚Äôt get in an item, and is not available for shipping delivery or pick up within 50 miles of my house, it should not even show up on your site. Your website Needs to be cleaned up in this regard. It takes too
Long for you to remove it from the site.

Otherwise I find it relatively easy to use. Sometimes to easey. My young child has placed orders for toys, candy & other items like cereal in her own. üòâ | Great quality furniture & prices over all 

Love love love this store | Lucky for me that this change is resulting in me spending less at Target! I shop by sales, and the new app update does not allow you to ‚Äúadd‚Äù or ‚Äúsave‚Äù any target circle deals like you would before (because all deals are now automatic).

Not only is having commercials for a pay app is bad, but having commercials for the app itself, SMFH. | This app needs to be redone. It never works. You try to watch it live, it just shows the spinning circle all day | Solo el dinero importa aqu√≠ algunos partidos que quiero ver ni los transmite tengo que pagar al menos 3 plataformas para poder ver un solo equipo jugar dan asco y despu√©s van de maricas a quejarse de la gente que retransmite pirata hicieran las cosas m√°s accesibles no pasar√≠a eso bola de mierdas | Content is fine but the app constantly crashes on both my iPhone and my iPad.  I uninstall and reinstall the app and it‚Äôs fine for awhile but after a few days the problem recurs. This has been going on for months. | Certain articles or videos don‚Äôt load, doesn‚Äôt matter the type of phone or service area. When connecting to my cable provider the screen won‚Äôt return to the one in which I‚Äôm actually able to view the event. The commercials are longer than the video clips at times. You have to pay for ESPN+ just to read or view certain articles. | When you click to read more from a push notification, the app often doesn‚Äôt take you to whatever the article is that you wanted to read more about.

It also loads painfully slow regardless of if I‚Äôm on wifi or cell service. Love ESPN, but the app needs to be fixed. At this point, I‚Äôd rather search for the news online and read articles elsewhere. | The UX designer for this app took great effort to make using the app as painful as possible. Spending 30 seconds in any other sports app will reveal just how poorly implemented the UI is. | Can‚Äôt click sign up button, nothing happens when I hit it. Been trying for 2 months bug still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. | Come on fix it | The video player does not work. I‚Äôve contacted support multiple times and cannot get an answer. The video player always gives error messages and I can‚Äôt watch any live TV. What‚Äôs the point in paying for espn+ when you cannot even use the service? Please fix this broken app | Just bought it to watch belichick on the draft and they played some dumb loop of players for 45 minutes | It‚Äôs cool for sports updates but if you purchase ESPN Plus you will not be able to watch anything unless you have cable too, that‚Äôs so stupid | Crashes when I open it‚Ä¶. | The only app I have that crashes on my iPhone 15... Dudes? | This is without a doubt the most frustrating streaming app that I use. Every other time I open the app I have to close the app, sign back in, and refresh my subscription. Either that or I‚Äôm automatically signed out. Very annoying to use and the interface is just OK. 

Not impressed for a company the size of ESPN. Figure it out! | Constant freezes, video doesn‚Äôt play or video feedback error (even though the advertisements play fine), etc. Ridiculous. Used to use this app all the time, find myself drawn to alternatives more and more | It‚Äôs so weird I have to put a tv provider in cause I‚Äôm just trying to watch a game on my phone and don‚Äôt have tv | Most of the espn + are either garbage or to watch specific sports you need a tv provider. Like bro I wanted to watch NHL playoffs on the go but guess what I sign up for espn+ so I can watch it on my phone‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt with a TV provider. Disney espn+ is lame with so many black out games. Just had enough of it. | I‚Äôve been using this app for a long time both for ESPN plus and ESPN programming all of a sudden ESPN programming is asking me to choose provider. I tap choose provider and nothing happens. Unable to watch programming on ESPN despite the fact, I have a cable provider and the app was working fine until recently. Extremely frustrating expecting an update soon! | The app is decent and works well for me but it barely has soccer. Me as a soccer fan this app is useless | Keeps freezing. Doesn‚Äôt matter if app updates, phone restarts or if I delete and redownload entirely. Just opens and freezes. Then crashes. Good to see where my money is going‚Ä¶ | If I had a nickel for every time a video wasn‚Äôt available in my region or package (even though it is) I‚Äôd have enough to buy Disney and run this garbage into the ground even more. There‚Äôs also no app support or customer service. Absolutely trash by a multi billion dollar company. | The app is constantly freezing and crashing. It never wants to allow me to click on anything. I have to close the app and open it a few times before I‚Äôm able to navigate through it. | App is garbage on IOS 17. & it‚Äôs $10.99/month Get real | It‚Äôs gotten better. The app could use a facelift. Really wish it would support live activities though. | What‚Äôs the purpose of having ESPN+ when you can‚Äôt watch any of the games for the teams you follow. Requiring a TV subscription sign is such nonsense. Cutting the cord? Not with ESPN+. | If you subscribed to this app to watch local games because you do not have cable; congrats, you just wasted your money. You have to have a cable provider to even be able to watch any local sports on the app which, if I had cable, I wouldn‚Äôt bother with this app in the first place. I pay for ESPN+ and go into the available NHL games just be told it is blacked out from my area. Is there no way to watch live sports at home without cable in the modern era? Seriously, disappointing. | This app used to work ok, not great, but ok. But with the latest updates I believe that they made things worse. I it is very frustrating to have it say an event cannot be viewed because of my region. I‚Äôm in the middle of the US and can‚Äôt watch an east coast hockey game? 
I have to always restart the app then it plays, but I HAVE TO DO IT EVERY TIME!!
Come on ESPN, I know you can do better. | This is very much a useless app if I can‚Äôt watch sports when I‚Äôm trying to log into my TV provider. Fix it | I have watched sports my entire life and when ESPN came out with their ESPN+ I was ecstatic to try it. Mind you I‚Äôm paying 10 or $11 a month. You would think that having ESPN plus would grant you access to anything that you would like to watch, but no, you need a TV provider what‚Äôs the point then? | Are there any plans to allow for the change of font size? This may be the only app that I use where you can‚Äôt adjust the size. This app has been around for a long time and still the same size font is the only one available | Screw espn, hope it goes bankrupt. Pay for the app but then you have to pay for a cable subscriber to watch?! Get bent. Coverage is terrible anyway, hey idiots I can get all your channels for free and I was paying for the subscription to be nice. Since your service is trash, your support is worse, it‚Äôs easy to cancel | LEBRON LOST | I can‚Äôt login using my tv provider and therefor I can‚Äôt watch local games that are on ESPN. Tried support and all they did was send me instructions on how to login. The issue it when I click on TV Provider nothing comes up. | I pay for it and they don‚Äôt let me watch a single game üò° | I want play ball | Even after paying for the subscription, I tried to watch watch the NHL playoff game and it just kept telling me I didn‚Äôt have that service on my spectrum TV‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have spectrum TV service. Complete waste of money never got to watch the game. | You can watch any game for free if you look hard enough, I don‚Äôt understand why I have to pay money for more than one subscription to watch nhl games. Everything on ESPN you will get on Disney and Hulu so if you bundle for sports you will not get what you want. I have to have this sub and hbo and a cable subscription if I want to see maybe most games. | Constantly signs you out then it is an epic ordeal to get logged in.  If it wasn‚Äôt part of a package would drop. | Why can‚Äôt I change cable subscribers on the app? Why make something so simple, so difficult? | I would rather read about sports and check scoreboards rather than have the amateur comedy team from Sportscenter do their song and dance around endless highlights. However, the app always crashes. Read fast folks! | If you subscribed to watch NHL, just save your money and find another route | Everything I read says that I can stream the NHL playoffs with ESPN+ (which I have). But every game is asking me if my life is absolutely worthless (having a cable sign in) | I signed up and paid for ESPN but cannot watch live game‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt know why.  Keep getting the prompt ‚Äúselect your tv provider ‚Äú‚Ä¶ | Really all I personally got the app for was to watch hockey games. 1) I can‚Äôt even watch all the games, some teams make you pay extra to subscribe to another network to watch their games so they are blacked out here. 2) once the playoff games started I couldn‚Äôt watch anymore because they make to subscribe to another network to watch them and apparently only on your tv. I actually don‚Äôt have a tv so it isn‚Äôt even possible for me to watch them. I will NEVER get this app again. I really wish I didn‚Äôt throw my money away on this app. | App is frustrating when it comes to tv provider. Doesn‚Äôt give an option to log out. Customer service is terrible. Waited over an hour for help just for them to hang up on me. What a joke. | This app was all well and good until the playoffs rolled around and then suddenly you need a television provider. Well that does it for this app. Well I cut cable a couple of years ago so I guess no playoffs for me. Don‚Äôt waste your money. | Mejor | Doesn‚Äôt work most of the time. Support is completely worthless. Would give 0 if possible. Rather spend more money and get better quality/more options. | Horrible streaming feature on espn+ it freezes and cuts connection all the time either on airplay or chromecast.

Boycott Airbnb | Airbnb is such a great idea. The owners made a great invention and have a strong presence in the hospitality industry. I love using the app and all communication from hosts to customer service representatives. Very professional and very helpful! | It won‚Äôt even let me book place to stay üò≠ keeps saying error please try again how do you have a app that books places for people to stay and it doesn‚Äôt even let u use itü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëøüëø | To be honest this app is average. When it comes to customer service AirBnB is abysmal! 

They outsource customer service to India, the support is slow, inarticulate, absolutely no help as they rely on their ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù whom you never directly converse with. 

I‚Äôm currently traveling and have been dealing with an issue with AirBnB that has gone unresolved for what now is going onto the 6th day - with x3 separate open tickets / claims with customer support. 

I‚Äôve had to find and pay for premium accommodations as AirBnB provides no help beyond fake assurances and fake smiles. 

Proceed with caution when traveling abroad as they will leave you stranded on your own. 

Their is no way AirBnB will continue to dominate the space under this business model. | There are few if any protections for guests in the booking process. Hosts have the power to set ridiculous rules and choose exploitative policies that hurt guests most. Very difficult to plan group trips when hosts set arbitrary rules about visitors. Additionally, the refund/cancellation policy is nearly hidden until after you book and then you‚Äôre stuck in a bad deal. If Airbnb is supposed to be the better alternative to hotels, they need to at least put guests first. | Your support team has been little help and now me and my family don‚Äôt have a place to stay this weekend. We are doing some remodeling this weekend and will not have access to our utilities. We decided to go with Airbnb because I have a dog and not many hotels are pet friendly. They won‚Äôt let me book a place because of a ‚Äúsafety risk‚Äù that we might be having a party due to short notice. Why would I book last minute to book a party. I just want a place got my family while out home gets fixed. ZERO customer support, once I contacted them to try and resolve it the support lady simply read off a script that said summarizes to ‚Äúto bad so sad‚Äù and ‚Äúwe sent it to the right team‚Äù . Might as well have AI answer their customer service | The hosting side of the app is terrible. Way too many issues. Booking as a guest is fine though never had any issues on that part | I have been a host for several years.  Generally good experience and the guests have been almost all wonderful.  However I did have one damage claim and got no cooperation or payment from AirBnB.  Very frustrating run around and very contrary to the assurances they give.  So just know you are on your own - they take the fees but do not support. | Trash app!! Don‚Äôt even let me book lol. | I love booking with Airbnb, it‚Äôs easy and has less fees than other sites! | First time using the Airbnb app.  We reserved an apartment located downtown San Antonio. Had great reviews, pictures looked good and a 4.9 on cleanliness. We arrive to our Airbnb and noticed the floor would creek pretty bad. There was dust everywhere. We found hair also in some places. The sofa was covered in stains & crumbs. There was a towel in the washer (only had a washer) the dishwasher was very dirty also the keurig, the bed sheets seem dirty too. It obviously looked like the place has not been cleaned in a while. We didn‚Äôt even stay for an hour there. I let the host know, also taking some pictures for evidence. I didn‚Äôt get every single thing because I thought the ones I did take were enough for anyone to tell this place was not cleaned. The host ends up telling it was cleaned that day and to send the pictures. He then told me I had to speak with Airbnb customer services because I asked for a refund. They end up telling me I can not get a refund because it was ‚Äúminor cleanliness‚Äù and only cared if I had a picture of the towel in the washer but not the sofa that had stains all over.  I couldn‚Äôt even get a partial refund. Airbnb only cares about the host and will side with them even if they are in the wrong. THEY DELETED BAD REVIEWS ON THEIR APP. | They cared and fixed the issue that we had. | It used to be a good way to book reasonably priced accommodation these days you can book a hotel room for lessüòÇ | The problem with AirBnb can be summed up by saying it could potentially ruin a vacation or save a vacation with many factor built in between. Firstly it‚Äôs layered as to who to blame.  First there are AirBnb policies and then there are hosts.  A hotel for example may clearly state the rules and allow rearranging travel because they have many rooms available.  Airbnb just has the one place you booked with a host who has options to rearrange, change, or refund.  Also those hosts aren‚Äôt necessarily great when it comes to customer service.  For example if you get sick and need to move a reservation around hotels and airlines are understanding.  Airbnb host might just take your money and run with no recourse other than a bad review.  Which AirBnb favors the host because you cannot sort by good or bad reviews.  It gives the average rating and then you have to sort through to find the bad reviews.  While I have experiences reasonable host who are accommodating.  I have also experienced a host who just took my money for no services rendered. This is the reason why I cease to use AirBnb ever again. | Love this app. If anything happens they take care of you! | This app is amazing I love looking at houses hotels and it is so relaxing to look at  when you are bored | Some of these hosts have the most insane cancellation policies found nowhere on earth - 50% refund if cancelled at any point in time, 100% upfront. Not only that, but you can‚Äôt even review the host after interacting with them. I will never use Airbnb again - see ya | Airbnb is the worst they will lock your account for no reason and the customer service doesn‚Äôt do anything to help time for them to revamp their company | Watched all the homeowners in my town use this to make more money by letting people stay in homes while the locals moved into hotels and cars. Kinda messed up and total waste of resources. God help us. | Hidden fees not shown until checkout. Other companies like booking.com and vrbo show the actual ‚Äúprice total‚Äù upfront on the map view. After cleaning fees, airbnb fees, and taxes, some listing totals double in price (which is insane anyways), so that should all be more visible when viewing map view. | The blocked me from booking at all because a comment I said celebrating me in my spouse alone for peace for his birthday they said it could lead to party‚Äôs so I‚Äôm not allowed to book any houses so I most definitely deleted this account you guys makes us leave comments then take the account away from your ai that can‚Äôt read correctly | Love the interface design. The best design in the industry. Just waiting for them to verify listing to weed out fake listings. It‚Äôs not that hard. They have the technology for it. I just don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt do it.

I also don‚Äôt like the fact that I cannot see what I made last year. 

I would like for them to show me what dates people like to view the most on my calendar. | This app is a mess. Try to search for a location then click on one‚Ä¶. Who knows where you end up. Date selection is a disaster. Even if you want a destination it always defaults back to ‚Äúmap view‚Äù. | Party house . I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs renting this out to kids? Over 100
Kids at party in a family neighborhood. Cops
Called,Guns found. 100 kids running from cops at 1:30-2:00 Am .
Helicopter overhead .This in not acceptable in a family neighborhood. This needs to STOP! Please close this bnb | Trust me | You pay with real money, but when you cancel, they give you credits that you can‚Äôt even withdraw. It‚Äôs really disappointing how the costumer service can‚Äôt even solve an issue with the host. | After getting scammed by a host, airbnb sided with the scammer, threatened to cancel  account, and kept my money which is basically stealing. I spent an entire year complaining ti customer service, and they kept promising to fix the problem only to ghost me over and over again. | The app is over 200 MB | Todos los lugares que voy la uso | Price filter in app is nonfunctional. Ridiculous bug for an app like this. | We had one of the worst experiences using AirBnB with an absolutely terrible host and AirBnB was a joke to work with. They do not protect their customers over the hosts which allows the hosts to get away with dirty properties, false listings, etc. and there is nothing you can do about it. We won‚Äôt be booking with them again. | I am a superhost of a monthly rental. Unless someone selects monthly rental my house doesn‚Äôt pop up at all. There‚Äôs a yearly event near my house that lasts 3 weeks. Housing was low and going for very high rates, but unfortunately for me my house is sitting empty because Airbnb won‚Äôt show my house unless somebody specifically request a monthly rental or input dates that exceed a month why not homes that are available in the area that are not meeting the criteria so that someone can still click on your house and see why they don‚Äôt meet the criteria whether it‚Äôs unavailable dates or maybe they would change and add an additional weekend so that they can get housing in an area where housing is extremely limited now there are a bunch of people that need housing that never found my listing and I know I‚Äôm not the only one because I‚Äôm in real estate and I‚Äôve had people calling me in the area that are having the same problem with Airbnb not showing their listing unless it‚Äôs over a monthly rental. Because of this, I‚Äôve listed the house on the local MLS because now it‚Äôs sitting empty. Lost revenue for hosts, Airbnb, and also people that need housing won‚Äôt find it because it doesn‚Äôt show up. | I had a burglary in Walnut, CA while staying with Airbnb. The evidence and police report proved it‚Äôs previous tenant broke in with passcode (the Airbnb host never changes password). We have lost our bags and even a car. Although car has been recovered, it has a stolen record on carfax. Airbnb and host started ghosting us since then. Disgusting they couldn‚Äôt do anything and let users bear all the losses. | I have been a user of the platform for years. Never encountered a problem (probably my own good luck).  When an issue finally arose, I was met with silence, and then what I can only describe as an automated, generic massage from what seems like a robot. Shame on you the company for allowing customer service to get this way.  Taking my business elsewhere.. | Title: Great Concept, Disappointing Execution

I genuinely love the concept of Airbnb and the unique travel experiences it aims to offer. It's a fantastic idea that has the potential to transform how we experience new places. However, I am deeply disappointed with how the platform operates, particularly when it comes to customer service and its arbitrary process for handling disputes and bans.

During my last experience, I encountered serious issues that highlight these flaws. The customer service for guests was not only abysmal but also completely opaque, leaving me frustrated and without clear answers or support. Even more distressing was the arbitrary nature of how bans are issued. I had an ex who misused the platform to stalk me by pretending to be a neighbor and even escalated to calling the police on me, leading to my undeserved ban from the platform. This situation was handled poorly, with little to no investigation or consideration of context, which was incredibly disheartening.

Adding to the disappointment is Airbnb's lack of a loyalty program, which feels like a missed opportunity to reward frequent travelers. When faced with the choice between an often too-early 10 or 11 AM checkout at an Airbnb and the flexible 4 PM checkout that Marriott offers for Titanium members, the choice becomes increasingly clear. The lack of such benefits, which are standard among hotel loyalty programs, makes Airbnb less attractive in comparison.

While I remain a fan of what Airbnb aspires to be, these significant shortcomings make it difficult to trust and rely on their service. It‚Äôs regrettable because I truly appreciate the innovative approach to travel Airbnb promotes, but without improvements in transparency, fairness, and guest benefits, it‚Äôs hard to see myself using this service in the future. | I love Airbnb as a traveler and as a super host! The honest reviews and photos assure me especially when I travel alone that I know what to expect. Especially when it comes to other super host properties and the host themselves I know I‚Äôm getting the inside of local eats and things to do! | I‚Äôve always used AIRBNB when I travel until recently. I stayed at an Airbnb in downtown LA during a trip. Knowing it was going to be shady finding parking plus the fact that I had rented a Porsche and wanted it garage, I immediately checked the ‚Äúhas parking‚Äù option as that was the most important thing to me. 

3 hours before I checked in, the ‚Äúhost‚Äù told me that I no longer had parking (I could no longer cancel at this point) he told me I would need to park a block away in an unsupervised lot and pay extra. He told me. Obviously this wasn‚Äôt okay, but I tend to let things go with the flow instead of cause a problem so I gave it a chance. Downtown LA is so unsafe and not only did this host lie to me and say it was in West Hollywood, it was a few blocks from skid row full of homeless people. The next day I found that someone had scratched my rented Porsche and was charged for the damage. After taking to I kid you not 10 different employees each asking me to explain my situation when they could have easily keep past conversations in file was sloppy. I spent a lot of money with Airbnb and all of it was a lie. I have no doubt the actual renter of the condo stored his own car in the spot he advertises for and hours before someone checks in, he cancels your spot.
I felt very unsafe walking a block to my Airbnb alone at 1am after meeting with friends when I expected to have a safe garage space. 

AIRBNB sided with their renter and I will never rent you airbnb again. Honestly hotels are now‚Ä¶ better at least I know what I‚Äôm getting, VRBO is great as well. | This app is incredible but I am no longer getting notifications since the last few updates- which impacts me as a host! I have tried to fix it from the app, from my iPhone setting, uninstall, reinstall- nothing is working. It‚Äôs a huge flaw that impacts my experience! | One of my favorite apps ever. I appreciate how many features the host experience has yet still feels lightweight and straightforward. | This app is great if everything goes as planned. But if your place is dirty, with trash in the pool. You only get one day of pool heating even tho you paid for two. They don't help with anything. Our power even went out for an entire day with no explanation. Airbnb have no help. Told me to request my own money back from the host? That's just weird? They also just ended the conversation when I asked to talk to someone higher up and just kept telling me to figure it out on my own. | DO NOT book with Airbnb. If you are trying to save money by staying at an Airbnb instead of a hotel, STAY AT A HOTEL!! It is reliable, safe, and filled with real customer service people.

I have had plenty of good experiences with the platform until recently. After having to leave a booking due to unsafe property conditions, Airbnb did not provide a refund from the host. 

We requested reimbursement for our alternative housing and communicated with Airbnb customer service for 3 weeks straight. We sent them video and photo evidence via email multiple times and they continued to deny that they recieved anything. Every time we sent a message there was a different representative and it was entirely written by AI, with grammatical issues and repeated phrases expressing how ""sorry"" they were in many different ways. They would also call me at odd hours of the day/night. Lastly, they denied that we reported the concern in time and kept on requesting information that we had already provided. | Airbnb isn‚Äôt even worth using anymore due to the insane hidden fees. The cleaning fee basically doubles the price of the stay and there‚Äôs no way to see it while searching. | airbnb should understand that their platform became successful because host were using their platform. Travelers would go with the cheapest and most convenience place listed my property on Airbnb after one month customer service is horrible. They‚Äôre not trained and all they care about is closing the ticket. | Well, I have been with Airbnb for almost 10 years. But last year I stayed with a woman in Norway who was racist and nasty to my friends and I. She left me a ridiculous review and I tried to explain to Airbnb that I had 24 amazing reviews. And on February 5th, they deleted her comment finally. When I logged onto my account months later, I realized that the comment was miraculously back. I called and asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told no. And even though I asked over and over again why the comment was put back, they just said nothing. So I am done. I have heard from friends about Airbnb leaving them in unsafe circumstances and I should have quit at that point. This is just scary to me and Airbnb needs to change their way of doing business. But someone will need them and that will continue. | I had to cancel a reservation because there‚Äôs no elevator and it wasn‚Äôt specified on the listing. Airbnb refuses to give me my money back. Blatant violation of the American Disability Act. Nobody cares at customer support. Filing a dispute with my credit card company | Annoying and don‚Äôt upgrade. Garbage map loading and if it ever loads. | Booked an AirBnB today and it said reserved, 3 minutes later it said my booking was cancelled and that I have to wait 5-7 days for my refund. Stole my money and now I am unable to pay for a place to stay until I get my refund. | I had a host harass and constantly contact me about nonsense and Airbnb didn‚Äôt do anything to help or assist me, insisting I just leave the Airbnb and pay for my own accommodation elsewhere. Not enough checks and balances there | Just google ‚Äúcan‚Äôt trust Airbnb reviews‚Äù and you‚Äôll see what I mean.

My one and only bad review on this app over years of using it was removed. I had a horrible host and I left a polite but bad review but it was taken down within hours. Once I googled what was going in, it seems like there‚Äôs way too many having the same issue. Reviews for locations within the Airbnb app are taylored to help the host. One cannot post a bad review which is why you almost never see negative reviews if any. Do not trust this app, just go get yourself a hotel and save yourself the headache and the host ruining your vacation. Not all host are bad but because of how AirBnb handles reviews, it‚Äôs impossible to know if the one you‚Äôre getting is a good or bad host. | They charged me for two separate stays at the same exact time and said that they were ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù reservations though I never booked either myself. What made the situation weirder was that they were in the same complex for the same exact dates making it look like it was a scheme. I have been trying to get a refund for TWO months to no avail. They have terrible customer service and terrible policies that do not help the consumer. I will never be using this app again and can‚Äôt wait until something better comes along.",4.77851,636096,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/dd/18/5b/dd185ba4-eaf9-4723-8f1e-ef81256b6702/affe9d16-12fb-4e90-bd72-2aef6db64875_A-iPhone-55-1_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/37/c7/65/37c76512-ed84-9f33-9abd-c2ff89cd82d4/aa7d1730-888d-4d4c-8740-072743767f11_A-iPhone-55-2_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/be/10/87/be1087a7-7ddc-643e-0eb2-248031384145/c4c9b288-b49a-463d-a76f-65b74ddf2689_A-iPhone-55-3_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f8/b6/b9/f8b6b9e2-195b-f4ef-cc7e-97438c2d53de/75604421-7b0a-43d5-bcd7-b3ca0ad853cd_A-iPhone-55-4_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/16/ae/a4/16aea4b8-8aff-de00-5938-b27c4985aae7/621b1af3-ef01-48c2-b187-fc48c27fd6af_A-iPhone-55-5_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/21/ae/6b/21ae6b47-4614-3551-aafb-e56015930660/92b9924c-eb2c-44bf-b6d3-dc9b319a013f_A-iPhone-55-6_en-US.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/99/d8/f0/99d8f0ad-31f8-6485-5651-e9b2dbfed177/2dd66dcd-28d7-4f52-a6c0-042cdb24fbc1_iPad-1_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/63/2a/03/632a03a3-7657-a304-89b1-2676ff054eee/172d6926-d10f-4027-972f-e5e2c9175158_iPad-2_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7d/f6/5a/7df65a00-67f3-15bc-c7bb-1f3d3bdbb745/755327b4-e398-42dd-9b06-46a1067e23a1_iPad-3_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f5/b9/55/f5b9555f-033b-c4a5-f54d-ab347b4411cf/7ea8755e-16f5-42b5-b865-e019cb12fc58_iPad-4_en-US.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I like the fact I can pay using apple pay. I really enjoy the convenience of not having to enter my card details since my card is already setup in Apple pay.  

It‚Äôs pretty simple to customize your order. An app exclusive feature is the ability to create your own box at anytime. 

If you choose drive-thru, which I do 99% of the time with this app, you just tell them you made an order in the app, they‚Äôll ask your name, ask you to confirm your order on the screen and then pull forward to get your order. Very simple, the restaurant gets your order right away. I have ordered while in the drive thru or have just completed checkout when pulling to the drive-thru speaker. 

This review is getting too long. Basically this is a good app. This app and the McDonald‚Äôs app are my most likely and most used apps for fast food because they work, reliably and well. | This app will say it‚Äôs your birthday and here‚Äôs a treat that you‚Äôre not allowed to add to the bag or redeem! Yay, you!!! üéº Happy Birthday to You!! No great to redeem, that‚Äôs true! Don‚Äôt let your happy day go to your head‚Ä¶ Eat at McDonald‚Äôs or Chick-Fil-A instead!!üé∂ | Compared to McDonald there‚Äôs no good deals on this app. Add that to already overpriced items. Sad! | I‚Äôve ordered a couple times, and I can‚Äôt even check my order or see my history when I ordered last. I tried refreshing I tried really downloading the app. I tried even using the contact us feature, but at the end of it, it tells me to write my order number, but I don‚Äôt know my order number because it never tells me. I can‚Äôt even go back to see it because it never lets me. Sample last time I ordered 2 chicken Chalupa‚Äôs and they sent me beef instead, and the potatoes that I ordered were cold even though I live less than five minutes away. But I couldn‚Äôt even contact them because it doesn‚Äôt show me what my order is and it doesn‚Äôt I made that order in general. it keeps glitching and that is so annoying. | Rewards haven‚Äôt loaded for me for over 5-6 months now. In addition, why did you all get rid of the fiesta veggie burrito??? I went daily to get this at lunch - now between that item removal & the rewards being inaccessible, I haven‚Äôt been to Taco Bell in months. Get it together tbell | No supporrt what‚Äôs so ever.  Good luck if you have a issue there is no way to get your money back | App keeps saying error on any payment I or my whole family try to use. It‚Äôs been weeks and this issue is still happening and not getting fixed. | The app makes you put in you credit card information and you can‚Äôt just give them a code | Just says oops try again in a few minutes and won‚Äôt let me order. When I go to the window and order there it‚Äôs twice as much. I think they just want me to give them more money. | Invalid payment method, can‚Äôt pay in any form.  Cant even pay online via web.  Can‚Äôt even login because it sends an email rather than just letting you login.  Can‚Äôt access my personal email because I‚Äôm at work, so I have to use my phone, which results in yet again an invalid payment method.  Horrific design. | It does nothing to make sure you‚Äôre ordering from the right Taco Bell and if you accidentally order from a different Taco Bell, there is no way to cancel your order or get reimbursed for food that you never received | Probably working as intended. It shows I have thousands of unspent points but won‚Äôt let me scroll to spend them | App said 3 working payment methods were invalid, no troubleshooting worked, support ticket required order details for an order I couldn‚Äôt even place, store employees couldn‚Äôt do anything to help (not their fault), had to pay 2x as much as if I had been able to use the app + couldn‚Äôt get what I wanted & couldn‚Äôt redeem rewards. Terrible experience from a billion dollar company, would give 0 stars if I could, do better. | App works and everything, but there are countless ads on different apps that advertise a free 5 layer burrito for new members. I was excited to try it out but after creating an account, there was nothing free | Glitches frequently and 2 times the Tuesday drop give a code and then would not let me add the item to my order. Don‚Äôt recognize item? Games are common.. | Can‚Äôt login with Apple for some reason.  I go through the Sign in with Apple flow and get dropped back on a web page with the Taco Bell logo that reads ‚ÄúSign In with Apple‚Äù but now there‚Äôs no button to sign in.

I‚Äôve been unable to login for a few weeks now.  Latest update from 22 hours ago made no difference. | Never able to add my rewards to bag so they all go to waste | They make it impossible to get a refund for missing items. There's an way to send them a message in the app but they NEVER EVER respond. They're prob making millions on undelivered items. | App won‚Äôt allow breakfast orders, rewards orders, or any other orders. Been like this for weeks now. | No way of cancelling orders that aren‚Äôt being delivered | My location has sweet tea. Most locations do.  The app doesn‚Äôt allow for ordering it. ONE STAR. Fix it TB. | It keeps defaulting to an awful location that forgets or messes up my food and has no communication or customer support the phone is literally off the hook. | Supper buggy. Can‚Äôt take my order constantly. Sometimes won‚Äôt even process it. Keeps losing my orders. | The first time I used this app, items were missing when it was delivered. This happens all the time with fast food, I can't blame the app for that. There is no way to fix it on the app though, the only way to do this would to be file a dispute on my card. I guess I will stick to DoorDash. | Unfortunately I am not able to use this app to purchase items on my iPhone. I was supposed to get a welcome chicken cantina which it lists as free because it gave me the promotional code, however, after I got there it does not let me order this item because it seems asking for a payment method even though it is free and when I try to enter my payment method (it is a valid card) it will not save it or even let me go forward. Will unfortunately need to delete this app so it does not work and instead go somewhere that keeps track of my rewards | I live 10-15 minutes away from Taco Bell depending on traffic and if I‚Äôm at work or home. I‚Äôll order before I leave so I can just pull up, tell them I have a mobile order, and have them start making it then. The last few times I‚Äôve ordered, it seems they have made my order before I even get there. By the time I get there, the app says my order is ready. Which means it‚Äôs been probably sitting ready for 10-15 minutes. Sometimes I‚Äôll order and not leave for another 10 minutes, so I don‚Äôt get their until 30-45 minutes after I place the order. So please, go back to making it when I pull up to the drive thru. Or at least give an option to set the time. | On the Rewards tab, ‚ÄúSCROLL FOR MORE‚Äù does not work. iPhone 12 Mini latest version. | I can‚Äôt even pay when I get to checkout, I had to order through web, be better Taco Bell üëé | App doesn‚Äôt work. Won‚Äôt add anything to cart | Yeah indeed‚Ä¶ trash app offshored to India quality as usual‚Ä¶ | Sometimes this app fails in purchasing. And gives you no error. Just an uh-oh.  And when this occurs you can‚Äôt make the purchase even with other payment methods. And when this happens you get refunded but you lose your rewards that you tried to use during the transactions.  This app is in desperate need of some exception handling. | Does not check to see if the Taco Bell you are ordering from is a realistic distance, now I have to drive to Ohio for my Crunchwrap. | App worked perfectly fine. Now I‚Äôm required to update my iOS to a version I can‚Äôt update to making this app unusable now. Del Taco it is from now on. Byeeeee | App is a mess. Locks you out before check out. Cannot process orders frequently enough that me and my android user husband just deleted it altogether. Extremely bad experience over multiple months. Just get a different restaurant‚Äôs food at that point tbh. | I‚Äôve had many orders with issues. I‚Äôve reached out to support for various refunds for missing items and I‚Äôve never once heard back. This is an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed. Taco Bell owes me somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 in missing drinks. | I have been using this app for the last few years and it USED to be amazing BEFORE this new update as of April 2024 - which is terrible. I almost don‚Äôt even want to order from Taco Bell anymore. Whoever designed this new app did NOT double check anything and should be fired. When you choose multiple quantity of anything it does not show the quantities you added inside your cart! I was placing a very large order and I had to do math in my head to figure out how many I had added to the cart ‚Ä¶ and they also changed the prices to be much more expensive which made it even more confusing to figure out!!! On this new update quantity only shows for each item AFTER you already paid!!! So if you made a mistake it‚Äôs too late! Secondly, when your order is finished now the app no longer rings a bell or alerts you. I was waiting and waiting and my order was already done and I did not know - so when I asked about it - it was really cold. And also the dummies who created this new app update didn‚Äôt even bother to check to look at the app update themselves; Because when you go to the rewards page there‚Äôs literally text over text and you cannot even read it. I feel like I‚Äôm being scammed without seeing the quantity before I pay. I‚Äôm a web developer, and if I‚Äôm uncomfortable to use this app now, I know other people are going to be afraid to place an order. It took me three times longer to place an order. Taco bell forced this update on my phone, and now I‚Äôm probably never going to shop at Taco Bell anymore. You guys ruined a really good app. Plus now your prices are ridiculous. The chicken/ power bowl used to be around six dollars and now it is almost 11 bucks. I used to order Taco Bell several times a month for my family, now you‚Äôll be lucky if I ever order maybe once every six months now. You ruined a good thing. Too bad for you. I will make tacos at home more often! | They WILL take your money and your reward. They'll say you earned points but they'll take those away when your order just mysteriously disappears. NO it won't be canceled, it will just randomly disappear. You also won't have anyone to call or chat with about this unless you want to start beef with Taco Bell on Twitter.  So if you want to just give Taco Bell free money this is the app for you! But if you want the FOOD YOU ORDERED this isn't the right place to do that. | A little sad that after a year or two of loyalty to Taco Bell and building points with them through receipts I was finally cut off the other day. Now there is a cap on how many receipts I‚Äôm allowed to scan within an allotted time. However, they refuse to give me a time when I can continue to scan receipts or a number of receipts that are typically allowed within a week or month. I‚Äôm poor so I pretty much rely on the free item when I have no food. Either allow me to scan as many receipts as I‚Äôd like and enjoy my free item that was paid for with the outrageous prices of previously bought food or at least be transparent about the scanning process in general. There was also no warning beforehand that i would only be allowed to scan a certain amount of receipts form now on. | Again I was logged out and it will not sign in from the email link. So frustrating | The app is super glitchy doesn‚Äôt show confirmation of purchase. My debit card was charged twice but no money came out. Just a pending post to my account. However Taco Bell app doesn‚Äôt show any purchase made‚Ä¶ uh so thanks ? Second time‚Ä¶ deleting app as of now.. | I wish I could give it a one star, I love Taco Bell and order from their all the time. I have a lot of rewards stacked up that I just don‚Äôt even wanna use. Every time I‚Äôve ordered off of that app I‚Äôve gotten the wrong food, missing items, nothing I asked for. I really wish I could love this app cause again I have so many rewards. | I ordered a customized mexican pizza order app completely changed the type of tacos I asked for. Please fix this | When you advertise Tuesday drops as being for in-app purchases only the promo codes should work. | I made a delivery order and when I pressed track order it keeps closing the app so it took my money and never delivered my food I ordered at all terrible app will never use again | I really cannot stand the app‚Ä¶ it seems like Taco Bell is actually hard up on the rewards especially the Tuesday drops. Never any code. App wouldn‚Äôt let me choose the free item I wanted for joining. | Jus placed an order to a restaurant 20+ miles away because the app defaults to last used location instead of closest (like every food ordering app on planet Earth). 

To add insult to injury, there‚Äôs no way to cancel an order. You have to send in a long form and hope to hear back. It‚Äôs been two days for me and no response. 

So I placed my order twice and was charged twice. Just do what every other food ordering app does as far as UI. This should be easy | No point saving favorites; TB discontinued any item deemed to be a decent value by customers, in favor of products 2x the cost with half the ingredients | I‚Äôm ready to file an FTC complain against Taco Bell. Your web site CANNOT and WILL NOT allow me to order. There simply is no checkout button. I go to the bag and the form ends after the promo code field. And this is a repeat issue. And there is no way to tell you this. I guess Apple should just pull the app and force you to fix your site. Zero stars you incompetent fools. | The location I went to was closed due to maintenance but still accepted my money and changed me for food I did not receive. I tried to dispute the charge with my bank but they denied my request. The best thing I can suggest is making sure the restaurant is actually open for business first before ordering on the app which also defeats the purpose of ordering food mobily but thats all I can think of. This has happened to me twice now at two different locations. There should be a window of time where if you don‚Äôt pick up the food, you get refunded the amount back. Like the mcdonalds app does | Not working on my phone anymore very disappointed",4.68789,1129076,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/71/62/32/7162329a-cfb0-7fe8-92c7-fdfcfdaa551d/09a8edfd-4a97-49db-8139-0aaac34f83fd_1242_x_2208px__U2022_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e8/62/a9/e862a9d1-0b6b-91ad-038b-20a525336f38/1face1e9-03b0-4010-8f78-d789c4f77739_1242_x_2208px__U2022_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e5/34/a6/e534a68d-2629-06e3-d6ae-e626d2c193dc/0434589c-cf88-47db-80e9-3253fa0627a0_1242_x_2208px__U2022_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a5/db/13/a5db13cf-65aa-5ee7-5640-88fd83191357/48173b57-9c6e-41d8-b07d-73b74a130ced_1242_x_2208px__U2022_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/da/e4/31/dae43102-f619-866e-dcb3-46b2711fea06/e5ed440c-e8b3-4bf0-ae21-c2c827e9db60_1242_x_2208px__U2022_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The only feature useful is police and construction. | Almost never steers me wrong | Sadly, I am switching to Google Maps. I love many of the features, but Waze lags too much on my phone. Maybe it‚Äôs an iPhone thing. I will often get right up to a turn and hear, ‚Äúturn left‚Äù! By that time, it‚Äôs too late to get in the lane. It‚Äôs even worse on the highway.

Frustrating. Seems to be a known defect that needs to be fixed. Back to Google maps I guess! | I started using this app recently and I like it. However, in PR, we use the metric system to measure distance and MPH to measure speed and can‚Äôt change the speedometer unit of measurement. | Been using for years and still annoying trying to do what should be basic stuff | Loved Waze UNTIL I didn‚Äôt. It took me to a mountaintop in the Smokey‚Äôs to ‚Äòsave time‚Äô. It didn‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôd be on the highest mountain. Deathly afraid of heights. We were scared barely made it down. Then, took us down a road that was closed. Literally, a piece of the road was cut out. It was dark, scary, barely saw that the road was cut out. Tank was on E.

After a week or two of use, I couldn‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt switch sooner. I also like how you don‚Äôt have to have an address plugged in and still able to get all the traffic alerts. | Reporting:
A recent update removed the option to report animals on the side of the road, and roadkill. This was definitely useful and I hope they bring it back!!

User interface:
They also recently changed the layout of different report options and while I understand they‚Äôre trying to make things easier to report while driving, I had gotten used to where the buttons were so I used to not need to look at my phone to report something. But now it feels like it requires more of my attention since the buttons are all in different places. Would‚Äôve preferred smaller changes over a longer period of time.

ETA/Best routes:
I feel like recently my ETAs have been less and less accurate and I don‚Äôt know why. I have ‚Äòpersonalized ETA‚Äô switched on and it used to be very very accurate. It has been taking me on routes that end up adding time to my drive as well.

All in all, I am NOT happy with recent updates. I used to love this app and would use it for my everyday commutes to avoid any unexpected traffic, but now Apple Maps seems to be a better option. Hope they fix things soon! | This app does not know how to give you directions to the left side of the street. it‚Äôs so weird that the only directions I can give you is going around the block when you can just turn left. | This last update screwed up my shared voices.

It‚Äôs saved me a great deal of time by allowing me to find the best ways to get from point A to point B without sitting in traffic for hours. It‚Äôs also saved me from numerous speeding tickets by warning me where the cameras and cops are hiding. The latest update I hate. They have the most annoying alert sound now. I don‚Äôt want a sound, just a voice alert. I wish the developers would allow you to choose what sound you want but no, you‚Äôre stuck with the default sound which is annoying.

Big L, loss of main operability and benefit of driving in congested areas | Excellent with route information and great at routing around slow downs. But why can‚Äôt a program with access to this much map information deal with time zones when it comes to computing ETA‚Äôs. | Longtime user of Waze who recorded custom voices for each set of instructions and alerts. While I enjoy the app, I can‚Äôt tell you how much disappointment the most recent update brought by using bell dings replacing the alerts previously provided by voice. | This is one of the best apps i have used | I can no longer find this voice üò° | The new update has overridden my custom voice direction settings with your default voice. What‚Äôs the point of that option if your system is just going to cancel it out? | Waze should do better design the app to better serve EV car users. | *** UPDATE*** Finally figured out how to keep this app from restarting itself and draining my battery. 
I deleted the app! 
The last straw was close the app. The time highlights blue again. The app is open. Closed the app. Time highlights blue again. Five times in a row then I deleted Waze. 
NO MORE PROBLEMS.
I don‚Äôt need Waze tracking my path from my kitchen to my bathroom. Why does the app keep restarting itself? When I shut off Waze through CarPlay it continues to run. Close the app on my phone it continues to run. Wondering why my battery is dying? Waze started up again. When it use it‚Äôs ok. To get it to stop sucking up battery I nearly have to restart my phone. Fix it so it shuts down when desired. | App is fantastic but gets two stars for one reason alone- STOP changing my route without asking! I purposely choose the toll free routes so I don‚Äôt spend an extra $8 driving to and from work everyday, and the app switches back to it without asking! Unless you‚Äôre going to start paying my tolls for me, this needs to stop. | I use this app a lot to get places. The only problem is you have to be careful especially when driving in the country. A lot of the areas I go to involve going through dirt roads and sometimes it misleads you or makes you go longer alternate routes. The only other problem I‚Äôve had is that it won‚Äôt delete my history. I tell it to remove old drives from history and it won‚Äôt do it. I have to literally uninstall the app and reinstall it to clear it. | i really wish you can add what apple maps has. | Just noticed today (4/18/24) that the alert for ‚ÄúHazard Ahead‚Äù is no longer a woman‚Äôs voice but a soft ding. Sounds like my vehicle is alerting me to something seriously wrong. When in fact it‚Äôs the new alert that there‚Äôs a car on the side of the road. After eight or so years of using Waze and being accustomed to certain alert sounds,  is you‚Äôve changed it so much I don‚Äôt know what it means until I take my eyes OFF the road to read the silent alert. Commuter nightmare! | Been using Waze for 9 years now! I‚Äôm on and off w/ Google Maps. I miss Waze‚Äôs friend feature, sad they got rid of it. It was actually pretty cool. 4 stars because connectivity seems to be an issue sometimes and if not, the only issue I have (and that‚Äôs the reason I hop back n forth w/ Google Maps). Other than that, Waze is the app to use. Their features are better and more user friendly accessing the play by play directions like Map Quest back in the days lol. Google, I‚Äôd have to click like 3 diff things to see the step by step route vs Waze I can just click the name of the street and it‚Äôll pull down! Download this app tho | For almost an entire month, the app has not been working. It keeps freezing when I enter my destination and try to start the GPS. I‚Äôm very disappointed. The latest update did not help at all. I did the update about two days ago. if it keeps freezing like this, it might mean that they need to increase the amount of bandwidth their servers can take. | BRING BACK ROADKILL as a hazard report | I really love Waze for all the assistance it gives, there‚Äôs a big problem..

I intentionally set the settings to avoid tolls..well it actually tries to direct me to tolls and it even tries to get you on toll passing my exit and redirecting me to follow tolls.

It‚Äôs pretty irritating.
Please fix. | I really appreciate this app. My sister told me about it. I used it when I traveled to Manchester, New Hampshire. Really smooth navigation. My one issue that I have when I first started this app it had master chief voice. That was the only one I used. Please bring it back.It‚Äôs a awesome feature. | I love this navigation app but I have not been able to use it because it keeps saying it is offline. Please fix | For the most part, I love this app. Love that it has more real up-to-the-minute traffic data, and I love to add data/info/hazards, as well.

But some features are difficult to click while driving. When I try to make a closure, it‚Äôs too hard to select the specific street/exit/ramp etc that is closed. The app tells you to click an arrow indicating the direction of the closure, and it‚Äôs a really small target, and sometimes the arrows overlap. They need to fix this problem. | Waze is the most intrusive app I‚Äôve ever seen. Putting the app to ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù mode means absolutely nothing when using CarPlay. I don‚Äôt want to start the app automatically. It‚Äôs good to use while driving on the highway and when I chose to use it. It should be illegal and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not, for an app to start even when you don‚Äôt want it to. A user shouldn‚Äôt have to play games with other apps just to keep Waze from opening. This app is not humanity‚Äôs gift, so the app developers need to stop treating it as if it is. An update to turn this app OFF needs to happen immediately. | Edit 4/17/24 having sound issues, I have no navigation sounds and no alerts. 

Literally have zero problems. Use this map everyday, drive truck for a living, no worries here. Live in one of the worst cities to drive in, and idk why you guys don‚Äôt get the proper routes you‚Äôre supposed to? I literally get mapped around traffic daily, and never usually have any bugs or problems outside of that. Great work guys! Works like a champ for me!

I would like to know how transaction went through I get an email stating thank you just to be told my order was cancelled. When size  is not available you are not able to click on it. I selected size and footlocker excepted payment. So much for sons Birthday gift. | The update has a login malfunction and the app violates privacy policies | The checkout experience is terrible. It is so hard to try and check out. Apple Pay constantly errors out.

But this app is horrible, and frankly, really bad for their business. The app crashes ALL the time and this has not been fixed for months. I finally realized having the app installed was not worth it with it continually crashing when I'm trying to shop, and just removed it from my phone. I have not had these issues with the Adidas and Under Armour apps so they are staying on my phone. | Jumped through hoops in the help chat to claim a challenge reward only to be told I need to call. What a joke. Thanks no thanks Nike | This is a treble app it does not let me use | So basically I was trying to make a new account, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me for some reason I tried deleting the app and redownloading it multiple times but it wouldn‚Äôt let me. I thought it was because I was underaged but it literally says 4+ and I‚Äôm clearly over 4 years old, so idk what happened but I‚Äôm very dissapointed. | add dark mode | Nike Dunks Low Drop (black and white variant).

To get started i was trying so hard to get the ‚Äúnike dunk low (black and white)‚Äù drop, and to continue it was the worst experience of my life. I was up since 8 am, setting up my phone and application, i had my wallet and cards ready, i had apple pay ready i had my macbook ready. And unfortunately it did go through and showed pending, and it only took me around 20 seconds to order the shoes in a Mens 13 for its re release on Nike selling for 110 dollars, a literal steal from the resell value of nearly 300 bucks at the time. But unfortunately i did place the order i went with Apple pay as i love its security feature and basic inability to have my credit card inform stolen easily. So i placed the order it showed pending for a long time and for what seemed forever. I went quickly to look at what sizes were left and everything was still showing in stock so i thought i did so good. To note these were so post to be a reward for me since i wanted these  whole entire summer since i worked my butt off for so long, So obviously these shoes I've been anticipating since i found out cause i wanted them so badly. But to go on, so the shoes go through it shows pending for a long time just for nothing to happen‚Ä¶ when i ordered the shoes and it showed pending it was still 10 am on the clock, i had requested the shoes with seemingly no issues right, WRONG, the order didn‚Äôt even process, so i go to message customer service when i tell them my concern about not getting my order yet since by this time the shoes were still not SOLD OUT it still showed most of the shoes sizes were still available including mine. And they basically condescendingly tell me that ‚Äòthis happens time to time‚Äô, upon reading other reviews and also going to call customer service twice because the first time they hung up on me in the middle of me speaking they told me that this had happened to hundreds of customers for this drop and that my issue wasn‚Äôt isolated whatsoever‚Ä¶ and i knee there was just no way i couldn‚Äôt have not gotten the shoes i was ready i was literally one of the first shoppers who were on the app and website ready just for them to be like, ‚ÄòYou unfortunately didn‚Äôt get the W‚Äô, when i read that i literally bursted out with rage because i felt so unbelievably disrespected because it was worded in the most condescending way possible along with other words before and after in the customer service message from this filthy worker named ‚ÄúKaylee‚Äù, because it was just beyond something else with these people they only care about money they dont care about even having a proper customer care team and clearly alloe their staff to make disrespectful condescending comments‚Ä¶ and basically when i called they basically made me wait 15 minutes twice‚Ä¶ and basically gave me a f off, and a excuse that i should have been earlier when i repeatedly said i literally had it pending within less then 30 seconds. And they didn‚Äôt seem to get it through their thick skulls on the fact i was also saying when it was pending every size was still available‚Ä¶ and before you ask my wifi and phone and devices were working completely fine it was clearly the application itself messing up everything and ruining hundreds of customers experiences and basically telling them to f off and wait for the next drop with no indication of when will there be another drop‚Ä¶ I believe any consumer would agree if they were out into my unfortunate situation that what happened was just plain unfair and just absolutely unfortunate and that nike didnt bother to remediate whatsoever what they allowed to happen because i heard even before this that the app and website likes to f people over by not accepting payments, not going through with orders and this is the website and app and they clearly need to go fire their app management and replace off of them and fire these filthy staff members and replace them with people who actually care about customers instead of disrespecting them and blowing them off‚Ä¶ | this app provides no purchase history but is forced for people shopping at the nike store... why? what value does this offer the user? in my opinion none - forced download to purchase - please tell me why this app offers me anything i want or need | When logging in the app it gets stuck on screen saying welcome back and doesnt ever load, i just wanted that megan thee stallion set  üò¢ | Can‚Äôt cancel order after 30 mins even though it‚Äôs still on ‚Äô preparing for shipment‚Äô | Every time I download this app and log into my account, it just sits on the loading page.

I absolutely love the. | I love Canva especially for my business they are super helpful and understanding! I will use them for any further business projects! Love this app and it‚Äôs super easy to use! I love that you can print your projects with Canva and they ship super fast and if you have an issue they are really quick to respond and to resolve it !!! 10/10 | I just loaded the desktop app to my Mac, and upon opening the app, signed up for a free, two-week trial period of Canva Pro, followed by billing through Apple for $119.99 for the 1-year pro subscription. However, I'm unable to access the Pro benefits, and have been redirected by Canva to purchase the Pro subscription through Canva. I'm concerned that I'm unable to reach a human being to resolve the situation. I specifically decided to apply my Apple account balance towards Canva Pro, but it appears my efforts were for nought. | Tried to save it so i could put it as my wallpaper (a pic) but it was all blurted out I couldn‚Äôt see anything | The worst part of Canva, is now, ALMOST EVERYTHING I SEE ON CANVA IS FOR CANVA PRO! I‚Äôm serious right now, things I see and want to use in Canva IS FOR CANVA PRO! | So I use this app on my laptop but on the website, but I got it on my iPad which I‚Äôm writing this review on ANYWAYS but whenever I try to open the app it won‚Äôt load. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app and it did nothing. Is there anyway to fix this? Btw the app/website is amazing! | It‚Äôs not letting me open freshly installed app, tried multiple times, latest version | It‚Äôs Good, Really Good
DesignCreativeCo.com | As a small biz owner of multiple companies & in full time ministry, I utilize canva daily. It‚Äôs easy to share to whichever business I‚Äôm working on at the moment. Very worth the money to go pro! | When I started, my YouTube channel are used to use other editing apps to do my thumbnails but it looks really amateur so I switched using Canva, which is really easy and simple to use and it makes my thumbnail look so professional! | Love this app | I really like the editing process! | Words cannot describe how helpful, beautiful and amazing this program is. 100/10 | ŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿπŸÑŸäŸÇ | One word: AMAZING ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§© | So easy to use. Invites are so easy now | Im constantly having issues I can‚Äôt use it on my lap top!! Please help me. | Life saver | Thank you for this opportunity. | I Hate Sitting At The Computer And Doing Design Work ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve Had This App Downloaded For Idk How Long && Just Decided To Use It Was Done In 10 Minutes ! | Canva is the perfect tool for me to use as a travel expert ü§óHaving  unlimited resources and ideas to help take my business to the next level by creating content and other options need for social media!! | I really love this app! if I have to summit up in one word, amazing!üíúüôèüèæüíñ | Canva is helped me a lot in design anything I want | When it comes to Canva I feel when it comes to technology it is up to date which I honestly love. In addition I love the way I can Customize a presentation to my style and not some default like Google Slides. But a flaw is sometimes the ai can be a little slow and confusing but as soon as you get the hang of it your gonna love this app. I used an app and I was paying $100 a month which is crazy to me that I can have such high Quality work for so much less.

Thank you to Canva  and have a blessed rest of your day and may good bless you abundantly. | üòÄ | For an app this expensive, it should work. Spent an hour on a project that I can‚Äôt download. Thanks Canva b | Excelente herramienta de dise√±o!! | Amazing company And product | You can use it for free ( I use it to make YouTube thumbnails, subscribe to my channel btw @creatorgamer1234), and it has no ads, doesn‚Äôt require money to make a good thumbnail, (although you can buy pro for bonus features), and is better than apps designed FOR YOUTUBE THUMBNAIL CREATION. Definitely recommend! | Excellent features | The software is actually really useful the problem is exporting and using any of the outputs. This is the only app I‚Äôve ever seen be practically incapable of exporting usable video. The exports a riddled with errors and fragments, randomly injected frames, repositioned text, playback loops and any number of missing assets. I‚Äôve had to resort to exporting them on desktop, saving through google images and downloading to mobile to use, which for this platform is insane. | I love this app so much this is such a good app for like edits YouTube intos and more | Cool | Da bomb | Their ai generator is biased against people of color. | It is great | I have truly enjoyed the simplicity and ease of working with this app.  So many tutorials available to go further.  Thanks so much looking for what‚Äôs ahead! | I love this app. It has helped me grow my business tremendously ! I would recommend to anyone. | Great app, everyone should have.. as long as you want to get Canva Pro. If not, the app is almost ENTIRELY useless. As almost all the image searches results will be pretty much completely Canva Pro. Is incredibly irritating, but still a good app. I highly recommend, as long as you are aware of the whole Pro thing. Great for making posters, invitations, and t-shirts. Even has book covers, screensavers, and flashcards. As well as mugs, business cards, and so so much more. You can also order some of the things from Canva, making for good merch. Great for practical use, but also just really fun to use in general. | One of the best app !!!! Loveee it | I used to be able to long press and copy an image from my gallery and paste it right into my canva design, but that is no longer an option. What happened? | I‚Äôm designing a journal on an iPad and at around 120 pages it started glitching to where I‚Äôd be adding or editing pages and the screen goes blank and says (Canva auto saved your file) and jumps to the first page. This is happening every 40 seconds and I can‚Äôt make substantial progress on my project. | It‚Äôs truly fun to design create and make content!

I love the Transformers and Sonic franchise. | 1/2 | Constant ads, vids do not resume where you left off, causing you to watch more ads. Dreadful | The content is what it is. I enjoy that. The app is rated low as I frequently have issues with it locking up. This is on iPad, iPhone, AND Amazon Fire Stick. I suspect it‚Äôs an issue with cached files not being cleared or being incompatible with an update. Usually I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it going again. | It‚Äôs unfortunate because Paramount has some good shows, but everything is literally unwatchable with the Essential plan. Its about 7-10 minutes worth of ads every show, and they freeze half the time making the show literally unwatchable. Cancelled my subscription in less than a week | It‚Äôs the best | Shellden | That‚Äôs really all I care about | It‚Äôs a great app and it has everything the only annoying thing is the ads they last around a minute | This app is absolute garbage. Nothing ever plays, all I get to watch are previews, which miraculously play just fine in full HD. Try to watch any of the movies or shows and you're met with error code 6000. DONT GET ON HERE AND TELL ME TO REINSTALL OR RESET. l've done that multiple times. It's your awful app that's the problem, not my devices. | I‚Äôm loving this app | The app is worth having. | So many bugs, errors, and more. The app simply doesn‚Äôt function at all. | Signed up for the free trial. Canceled less than a week later. They still charged my CC. And there is no easy way to get a refund. The website directs you to bots that offer articles but no help. 
DON‚ÄôT SIGN UP FOR A FREE TRIAL. ITS A TOTAL SCAM. 
I will have to call my CC company to get the charge removed. Such a sleazy way of doing business. | hood selection of choices. great reliabilty. i love this app. | Stop with the annoying adds they go on for 30 minutes!! I‚Äôm just trying to watch my movie and it won‚Äôt stop showing adds | Paid for subscription . It won‚Äôt even load from the App Store.   Refund please | On Apple TV, The screen just goes black. I can hear audio and nothing else. I subscribed to watch this movie. I can watch everything else on paramount + but not this movie. Disappointing | Neither CBS or Paramount + will work on my tablet or TV. I can only use the subscription on my phone. | I put on the correct information of mine, and it still keeps hitting me with the same ‚Äúregistration failed, try again later‚Äù | I love this app don't get me wrong here but so many adssssss | I know that free apps depend on ads for revenue, but this is ridiculous. I was watching a series and prior to the episode there were five ads. The episode beginning credits started and then there were six more ads!  I end up spending more time watching ads than I do program episodes.  I‚Äôm deleting the app because it‚Äôs not worth it. | There is always ad the second I tap on something and right when I watch the best part an ad is there | tv app and iphone app forget your last episode .... Tons of app issues, it's like they're learning from the first day of ever having a streaming app... welcome to the 21st-century Paramount Plus, get your $&@t together .... charging me money but not delivering a smooth app | UPDATE: i already pay for enough services. im not gonna pay another $10 a month just to STILL have ads on this platform. netflix has 20x the amount of actually enjoyable shows than you, max has the same, hulu has the same, prime video has the same, AND THERE ARE NO ADS! yet you want us to subscribe to your showtime option, AND STILL GET ADS WITH IT. your developer response is worse than no response at all. 

in a 45 minute episode there is at least 15 episodes worth of ads. honestly it feels like more in the last couple of days. you make money on the subscriptions, how many ads until you make enough? it feels like a crime | I thought if I paid for the more expensive subscription it included no ads. No I‚Äôm seeing a few shows allow ads which is just the most ridiculous concept. Like how contradictory. 
Don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm paying for at this point. Worst then Netflix. | Eager to pay for an app AND excited to watch ads? Paramount Plus is your garbage. | Asking me to write a review and other annoying pop up messages, and there‚Äôs no way to turn it off! I‚Äôll be cancelling if this continues to bother me! | I paid for the ad-free option (full year up front) but still get ads before shows start, so not really ad-free just less ads. Takes too long for content to load. Don‚Äôt have these problems on my other streaming apps, just Paramount+. I think they tried to make the app more than it needs to be so it has to work harder than needed. Also, a very annoying thing is when I finish a series it will start some random series I wouldn‚Äôt watch so then that series, that I don‚Äôt want, is stuck on my ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù list. | Why am I paying for ad free, but I am watching violent and scary ads before I can watch a funny sitcom? | Too many ads. Want to see something in a scene make closely so you pause it? Too bad. Ads get in the way. | Best thing I‚Äôve ever bought. | This app is absolutely terrible no matter what you are watching it on. Very slow very unresponsive, the app just shuts down all the time. Boots up slower than a windows 98 computer. I honestly don‚Äôt know why im still paying to use this app, might be time to cancel. | The cancellation process is absolutely terrible. You have to log in from the original device you signed up with. We have streaming devices all over the house and have no idea what we used to sign up. I reached out on X for a phone number to call and support reached out with a help guide to cancel, which of course directs you to log in on the original device of subscription. Really frustrating! | Love this app! User friendly and very organized! | The best of the best. | It‚Äôs worth itüòç | Who would like to pay $50 like a week and who wants to watch ads WHILE THEY ARE TRYING TO WATCH SOMETHING ANYTHING | Good app good shows just keeps crashing here and there when I view it in pop ups | It was very nice but sooooo slow | first month user, I have found it very hard to download shows to the app, compare to many other app, i use. I have even switched to standard quality, and switched back and forth between Wi-Fi and cellular data, just to be sure before posting this, I started downloading almost the same size shows on Netflix, Hulu and Paramount, all in the same time, The other two finished and paramount is at %18 only , I also have deleted and reinstalled the app, and nothing changed, I googled this and looks like a lot of people have the same issue so you probably knew about this already . that is a deal breaker, I want my money back, and I won‚Äôt be renewing after the end of my monthly subscription. | If you‚Äôre going to have a horrible app that resume doesn‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs restarts the show every time you stop it, can you at least make it so it registers that you already watched certain commercial breaks and not have to rewatch.  I just watched about 6 minutes of commercials on my 15 minute break because I was 3/4 of the way through the show and when it restarts, I can fast forward through the show but none of the commercials.  If I had to pay for this, I would be cancelling and asking for my money back!!!! | The content on paramount is pretty good. I just don‚Äôt understand why their app is so bad no matter the platform it is on. I have closed the app and not watched anything multiple times because the lag while scrolling through content just about makes the app unusable. | I‚Äôve also noticed they respond to positive reviews instead of the reviews trying to help them make the app a better experience. | I like the content on the app, but I swear I struggle more trying to navigate the app than I do watching the shows and movies. It always gives me an error message, then I watch a few ads, then the app crashes, so I reload it, get an error message and watch a few ads, then I try to pause the show and it doesn‚Äôt pause, it just shows the pause icon, then shows me an ad like a pause menu would, I try to back out of the pause menu and have to put the show back on and‚Ä¶ surprise watch more ads. I feel like paramount is just raking in the money and doing nothing to fix the busted UI because people are still paying for it. I think I will have to take a break until these are fixed. | It‚Äôs worth it just for all the classic Star Trek plus my kids love Sonic so we all are very excited as a family for the Knuckles show!!! | This app has so many flaws it‚Äôs ridiculous. Between the constant replaying of the commercials ,the glitching, and not being able to hit resume on the show you‚Äôre currently playing is beyond annoying.

However, I would like news that I would be able to have access to. I always get the locations, but I do not get the actual story.

This app sometimes sends too many notifications about stories that aren‚Äôt really important. Also, when it does send an interesting article it doesn‚Äôt give full details. I end up with more questions than answers.  Starting to not really like this app. 

My Old review:

This seems like an odd social media app heavily filled with those badly LONG articles that can‚Äôt get to the point. At first I appreciated how it shows local news so I know what‚Äôs going on in my area. But then, I started noticing when you click the video links, the video just seems like a random live clip. For example, I clicked a video from an article about trump and they were talking about r‚Ä¢‚Ä¢e(not at all about the article). When that video finished, it scrolls up and starts showing me a random persons recording of a guy beating up his wife‚Äôs cheater. Scroll up again and it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre on TikTok or X. What kind of an app is this? I‚Äôm so confused. | On all of the ads I‚Äôd seen on various websites for this app, it made it seem like it was a giant map with different crimes you could select and see roughly where they happened. It looked very cool and something I would have told a lot of people about. Not this. This is not what anyone is interested in anymore. We see these kinds of things everywhere anyway. Yahoo, ksl, Facebook, etc. it‚Äôs not something that stands out. (It is a well made app, I‚Äôll give it that though) | This app is sooo fake it said that it had a Robbery at my house but there was not and it says every week there‚Äôs 10000 crimes like that‚Äôs so cap | This app is 90% Rainbow people propaganda machine!!! Leans so far to the left that it nearly falls over. | That it‚Äôs calling cool and sends me alerts | This news is very American but the ticket on the chin I like it. | Awesome local news, thanks much! | It‚Äôs a nice app and is helpful to be able to see the crimes in your area and local news. Although I wish the crime map updated faster. I live in Chicago, and whenever I check the crime map, it shows me the crimes from a week before, and not the current crime in the past few days. Other than than I think it‚Äôs a good app. | All ads. Good luck trying to read an actual news story. | I downloaded this app to know what is going on‚Ä¶.. not what‚Äôs happening an hour away u literally wasted space on my phone what a waste of time | EXCELLENT!!!!!!!! | News and Timely reporting, many views available. | Some articles text size too small | While the app will notice you with some info from wherever you are, the information is irrelevant with slanted often racial views and on their lighter pop culture pieces almost all of the posts lure you in with articles referencing views, videos or photos that are never included in the articles. Waste of time articles that are poorly and only partially scraped from other third party sources. Scared of what they‚Äôve done with all the personal data they inevitably capture. Find legitimate news. | I love NewsBreak because it lets me know were stuff is happening but most of the time a lot of stuff it tells me is not happening were I live . It‚Äôs fine though cause I still like knowing what is happening in the world | Investment news | I keep blocking certain sources that post things I do not want to see but they keep showing up on my for you. I‚Äôve tried reporting, blocking, selecting to show less but they still keep showing up. I‚Äôll change my review if someone can fix this | Horrible | Very fast at informing the most recent updates on news really like that the only news I watch üëç | All the ads makes it very difficult to read the articles. And just so you will know I make it a note not patronize any of the advertising companies. I  meticulously make sure I do not buy their products. If it is just a few ads when you can‚Äôt see through to read I give up | Acertivos en su forma de presentar las noticias | Simple quick informative | I can‚Äôt even open the app to get support because it‚Äôs stuck on an article that‚Äôs just spinning and not loading and I can‚Äôt do anything else with the app | This app has so many ads that it‚Äôs difficult to actually read anything. I got this app hoping it would give me important local news because I don‚Äôt watch news tv stations, but it‚Äôs such a fight to be able to read the whole article that I‚Äôm deleting it. | Horrible the way you have only left slanted articles on President Trump. Not truthful or honest  journalism   Where are the truthful articles in Biden and his family. Do not use this site | It keeps everybody safe and it‚Äôs real | This is the place to come if you want to be bombarded with left wing garbage.  Chinese developer.  No need to say anything else. | Hate when the stories go blank before they are complete.  Fix this please! | There has to be a news app that isn‚Äôt 80% ads!!
Too bad, because it has great potential | Hate speech on every story. The developers need to wake up and realize that ‚Äútaking no action‚Äù is in itself an action. By not standing up to bigots you are SUPPORTING bigots. | To much Christian rhetoric!! Other Faiths and religions live in America also üá∫üá∏Republican based for sure! | It always helps you know what‚Äôs going on around you | I love it | This is one of the best apps for local news and celebrity news. I just love how I get notification from my phone. 10 out of 10 download it again. | I love this application. We all are a family here, and I get to vent and explain I how really feel about things. You guys are the best, keep up the good works! | Everything that you could possibly want and more .

Notice this app have nothing to do with the business and everything about Express you don‚Äôt believe me keep looking true post and LinkedIn don‚Äôt do anything about that. | Everything else about the LinkedIn app is great, but using CLEAR verification is a terrible move by LinkedIN. I got scammed into getting CLEAR at the airport once too and it was utter trash. Apparently, clear won‚Äôt verify me on LinkedIn because my phone plan isn‚Äôt in my name. I‚Äôm a student, so I‚Äôm under my family‚Äôs phone plan. As are many other students, as are many other cousins, wives, siblings, etc. What a scam!! Also, how is having the same name on a PHONE PLAN even verification of IDENTITY. Customer service tried to then tell me longevity - what a lie - I‚Äôve been on the same phone plan for 15 years!! To maintain its reputation and continue to get new users, LinkedIn needs to discontinue the usage of CLEAR now! For new users like myself, it‚Äôs really frustrating that hold users were able to get verified no problem before CLEAR came in the picture. The only thing clear here is that LinkedIn should stop working with such a joke of a company. | I am a premier member of LinkedIn. I tried to update the app and LjnkedIn is trying to make me pay for the app again.
I cannot get this corrected, so only one star that should be none for non-service.
MSM | Let me close out the annoying ""do you love this app? Please rate"" without saying that I hate the app. 10/10 I hope more apps stop harassing me. | I‚Äôve been trying to make an account for over 18 hours now and all it keeps saying is for me to do a verification check. Sure no problem. I do the verification and it ALWAYS comes out telling me ‚Äú Your noCAPTCHA user
response code is missing or invalid.‚Äù

What does it keep doing that? | This app is becoming completely useless. The verification process never works. Adding an invitation note only allows up to 200 characters and you can only send 5 invitation notes per month (!) unless you want to pay $99 (!) every single month (!). | The LinkedIn app is quite useful and great for professional networking and development. I‚Äôve noticed that the connections tab, specifically the lists of recommended people, becomes very laggy after scrolling a little while. Also, it causes my device to get hot as it loads more; on occasion, it might crash. While it‚Äôs not a hindrance to the experience, it‚Äôs an aspect of the app that should be profiled. | LinkedIn is the poster child of hostile design. It‚Äôs awful. They bombard you with the dumbest ads and irrelevant content. It‚Äôs a horrible app and website. I hope it crumbles. | I was so excited to use LinkedIn to network and get my new career launched. I‚Äôm so disappointed.
The app is so bad. I‚Äôm trying to verify my identity by uploading a picture of my license. How can I upload a picture of my license if it won‚Äôt take my photo upload no matter what I do? I contacted persona and they told me the issue was with LinkedIn. But you can‚Äôt reach LinkedIn‚Äôs support unless you‚Äôre signed in first. But I can‚Äôt sign in because this app won‚Äôt take my verification proof! Please fix this!
Also, customer support is useless. I‚Äôve reached out to them at least five times. A lot of these companies that just do customer support over messaging/emailing don‚Äôt help people at all. Please bring your customer support phone contact back. I have a very specific problem that can‚Äôt be solved by your ‚Äúsmart‚Äù Q&A system. | ÿπŸÜÿØ ÿ™ŸÜÿ≤ŸäŸÑ ŸÖŸÜÿ¥Ÿàÿ± ŸÑÿß ÿ™ÿÆÿ±ÿ¨ ŸÑÿØŸä ÿÆÿßŸÜÿ© ÿßÿ∂ÿßŸÅÿ© Ÿàÿ≥ÿßÿ¶ÿ∑ ÿßŸà ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ŸÜÿØÿßÿ™ !! | Toxic | Basically ID theft with a name.. | Yea. Team. You fixed the glitch!!!! Thanks | It keeps saying that i reached my number of attempts but i tried it in the next week so what attempt? 

Really disappointed! I sent an email to Linkein about this but never get replied! | Thank you to the developers at Linkedin. I have been a member of the community for many years. I think I can say, I have never har an issue with Linkedin. Not one. Certainly can not say that about many other well know apps and platforms.

Thank you for providing a valuable platform that is easy and efficient to use. | There are a lot of bad reviews coming out about LinkedIn and I have to agree with a lot of the users that are complaining about the application not being secure and losing 100+ connections without any reason. I‚Äôm also pretty sure that the customer support is a chat bot just giving generic responses without actually resolving any issues. 

I‚Äôm still trying to retrieve connections that were missing without any action on my end or the connection‚Äôs end, therefore they were just automatically deleted?  This is very detrimental because a lot of connections are friends and losing connections could cause a lot of confusion with a lot of people. If LinkedIn is unable to resolve these issues I will have to suspend my account until they‚Äôre able to resolve them.  Be very careful with this application because their security is very sub par. | I have an error in the app

When converting the program language into Arabic, the option of adding media to the application disappears. | Just got a notification about my ‚ÄúRecruiter View‚Äù. How do I opt out of that? Not everyone on LinkedIn is looking for a job. Also, let us opt out of suggested contacts and posts by strangers. If you really want us to have ‚Äúthe best experience‚Äù, don‚Äôt assume we are looking for a job or want unsolicited suggestions. | How is this app so bulky? Over 360mb?

The space program landed people on the moon with only 74kb. 

Stop bogging down our devices and forcing people to upgrade. | Having trouble pulling up followers??  Help !! Tried everything nothing is working. | Started with Zinzino team 60 days ago and now on linkiedin for more customers. | For some reason LinkedIn keeps putting my profile in hibernation mode. Happened twice now and no phone number or email for support to help me. I got an email saying my account has gone into hibernation and I have to wait 24 hours for it to be unlocked. But no where in the email does it say if I didn‚Äôt request that then contact LinkedIn. So after 24 hours I got into my account and then an hour later happened again. Why?? Now I have to wait to Sunday and try get in and raise a ticket to get this resolved before it happens again. Anyone else experiencing this problem and why is LinkedIn putting my profile into hibernation? | This needs to be updated. I will update my review once they fix this inconvenient issue (so much for convenience, networking, and connecting when you cant even do that). I just joined and so far two thumbs down no good. Seriously frustratingüò£üôÑüòí | Keep the App business savvy less like social media. It‚Äôs a social network app not social media. | Why does it keep saying that noCAPTCHA user response code is missing since I already followed the instructions correctly? ü§¨ | If your email is inundated with emails from scammers and FAKE JOB/CONTRACTS, put this protection measures in your reply email, to get SOME protection and possibly deter them from taking further steps to waste your time, or (even worse) money!

Put in response email to recruiter:
Which company is this role with?  Also, please elaborate on how fast they are looking to fill the role, and what the interview process looks like?

Also, as many of the emails I get for jobs from recruiters nowadays are not ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù, let me know if you can verify the following:

this is not a fake advertisement or opening, 
this is not not a fake job/contract (be able to verify in the company‚Äôs website the opening, and if need be with their HR, that this role is open and they are actively recruiting for it), 
and agree that the role will not go on hold before the interview process completes.
Let me know of the next steps, after you have answered and/or agreed to the questions and/or statements above. | Glitchy app, when removing a followers the app crashes all the time | I am normally very hard on reviews for IT apps. Both the desktop and the mobile app either iOS or android I believe that LinkedIn has taken great steps in order to do this right and do it right the first time. Has anybody worked at Gmail or Google or chrome and wondered what third-grader made this? | Worst customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced. It‚Äôs hard to create verified account. Persona doesn‚Äôt work for verification. So your account will restricted if you are not able to verify your identity. But they restricted you right away and you need to create a support ticket for reaching out to support. The funny part you can‚Äôt create a support ticket without login your account. So another option is creating another account then create a support ticket with that account. But this is violating their agreement even after you verify yourself they permanently suspended your account. 

So worst worst worst  customer service ever!!! | When the job page is scrolled down and loads about 50+ jobs, it starts to lag very badly. 2 seconds freeze for a small scrolling and the company alumni profile photo icons keeps reloading. Please fix it. So frustrating. | I was content with linkin, until it added that button for hiring or looking for a job. I‚Äôm neither and I can‚Äôt seem to get it off my profile. Why are there so many things that get forced down our throat? | it just keeps crashing, and there is no way to open it in the browser‚Äî smart!!! | I can't even pss the verification everytime I do it it repeat continuously even when it's done correctly can't even log in in the app anymore. | I tried to get a new password, but the app did not send a code to either my cell number or my email. | I want to be Linked Out. Thank you for being responsive to my request. | My LinkedIn account was suddenly restricted for no reason. The unlock process doesn‚Äôt work and I‚Äôm stuck with no access to my account. | I‚Äôm so pleased with your products that I‚Äôm going to purchase some for my family and friends. 

The name itself tells a lot about You and your purpose. I feel and see the difference in my skin only after three weeks, and all the Love You‚Äôve put into it. 

God has Truly Blessed You with something amazing and I‚Äôll use it as long as You make it.

Thank You so much and I look forward to seeing You one day.

Lona Mallory Lane, from Chicago | They MAY have been hacked today as many of us got restricted and it‚Äôs asking for much more personal info. Hopefully it didn‚Äôt but it may have as myself, fianc√©e, and friends all got this today. It‚Äôs 4/15/2024. As of the moment I would not set this up until it‚Äôs figured out. Wouldn‚Äôt have been so worried if it was just me. Has been a good company otherwise. | The app drains my battery even when I‚Äôm not in it. I don‚Äôt have background refresh on either. LinkedIn must me sending data out, or something. Careful!! | This app still your information and my device started acting weird. Don‚Äôt get this app is a scam you never found jobs is a network to steal and sell your information. | I liked previous versions of the app where you could mark a notification as read without opening it or taking another action like writing a new message draft. Whether it‚Äôs a simple oversight or a way of artificially boosting engagement numbers for LI‚Äôs content, it is a downgrade to the user experience and needs to be reversed. | The ‚ÄúConnections‚Äù tab has been replaced with reels‚Ä¶ Very Disappointing. LinkedIn should be proud and further investing in a framework that publicizes innovative ideas, scientific research, and economic/fiscal quarter reports‚Ä¶ Not short-clips from ‚Äòcontent creators‚Äô lecturing viewers on ‚Äúhow to not get gaslit during an interview‚Äù. This decision drops linkedin‚Äôs content quality to a standard that‚Äôs not worth my attention anymore. I‚Äôm sticking to their desktop version from now on. | App
Keeps crashing after opening? | Short form video content has no place on a professional networking platform | Need to get rid of video tab and return classic ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù tab without the catchup distraction. 

Its good to experiment but this is a bad version that needs correction. | I really dislike the video feature on the app. The app was unique in the sense that it didn‚Äôt have reels. I feel like LinkedIn was better when it was just a networking  and career focused app. | LinkedIn charged me for premium business despite canceling the service, even running a payment on another card of mine that I never authorized LinkedIn to charge from. And of course there is no customer support contact of any kind listed on the app. Absolutely ridiculous, a platform that is made for professionals should not be employing such obvious underhanded tactics, it gives the company a bad name. | YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK IDENTIFICATION FROM USERS‚Ä¶ I do no need you to protect me from anything‚Ä¶ I need you to allow me to express freedom of speech and speak the truth.

You are complicit in the current Palestinian Genocide and in shutting down voices that speak on behalf the oppressed‚Ä¶

I WILL TAKE ACTIONS AND WILL REPORT YOU 

They are censoring everyone that is pro humanity and pro Palestine. Restriction of traffic, deleting posts and comments, shadowing accounts‚Ä¶ Just despicable.

I think many don‚Äôt like to keep hearing the same music but shift gears a little. Overall very satisfied | Music üëç | I have to log out of my account and log back in every time I use this app because my playlists disappear. I could understand if it was the free version but when you‚Äôre paying for it I would expect the app to at least be able to keep your saved music | VILLPANADO | Hi YouTube music asked me to do this review I love it been using it for about 4 years I believe but I haven‚Äôt gotten a recap ever for new years n that made me a lil sad :^( | I‚Äôve never left a review on any app on my life but YouTube music changed that this is by far the best app to listen to music.üëçüëçüëç | Keeps songs easy to access and have playlists and able to download songs and playlists for when you don‚Äôt have service on a plane or when I travel to Seattle through the mountains | EQ please

I‚Äôm still finding it difficult to understand if you have music in the download section and you select that music play the music everything‚Äòs fine but when you select options for that song, you barely have any in the download section, it doesn‚Äôt allow you to go to the album it doesn‚Äôt allow you go to the artist you have to go back to the normal section. This is super inconvenient and super annoying. I also find that songs are never cashed. Maybe there‚Äôs an option I don‚Äôt know, but they‚Äôre never cashed so if I‚Äôm in a dead section dead cellular section, the song that was just playing we just randomly stop because it didn‚Äôt cash it. (I repeat songs a lot) why is that way not efficient also, it‚Äôs extremely taxing on data. 

EQ please | I don‚Äôt like that y‚Äôall took the ability away to control our music, replay, or switch to another song, but you guys added it to premium. This will not make you guys more money but will actually make less money then how it was last time. Please change this update immediately this not a good update and I very much think that this update should be changed. Please read this and change your update please and thank you. | Gives you 30 minute ads while sleeping and are the most invasive app for stealing our data | Offline music will only load in CarPlay when there is a good data connection or mobile data is turned off. One bar cell service, good luck. The app just hangs. Makes no sense. 
Other things that make no sense in CarPlay:

Will not display track list when an album is playing. Does not display playlists (at least I don‚Äôt use those). Occasionally will show no album art, or album art from the previous track, until the current song has been playing for maybe 30 seconds.

I tried to use the app for podcasts after Google Podcasts shut down. The migration tool for subscriptions seemed not to work, and it turns out this is probably because most of my (pretty mainstream) pods cannot be found in YTM. ??? Now I‚Äôm cobbling it together with Audible for this purpose!

Pretty disappointing, considering I‚Äôm here as a YT Premium subscriber. But I‚Äôm in that mainly for the video benefits, so I can at least tolerate the YTM CarPlay oddities. | OKAY so a few months or weeks ago I wasn‚Äôt using the app and when I went back on it I was listening to music and when I was going on a other app the music stopped so I check it wasn‚Äôt playing and when I played it and I went on a other app it stopped again so please fix this and plus it was working when I started using it and I luv it but it just bugs me when I try to listen to music and play on a other app so please fix it‚ù§Ô∏è | The coupe GLARING inefficiencies make it hard to give it a great rating. I love the radio stations, the variety, and havibg the subscription come with ad free YouTube Premium is probably the only reason i keep it. The features this service and app offers really are better than the competition.

But the few things I can‚Äôt stand are really annoying. It‚Äôs google, you‚Äôd think cloud syncing would be a no brainer, but I can‚Äôt even get THIS APP on THIS PHONE to remember my playback position if I pause it and leave the app for 3 minutes. I open the app back up, and the song I was listening to is gone. It‚Äôs SO ANNOYING. This app seriously needs better multitasking capabilities. It seems cloud syncing my playback position would be the best answer. Then I could for example, pause on Chrome or Nest and pick up on the app right where I left off.

Also, the app has been randomly pausing my songs while I‚Äôm in the middle of listening lately? Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs headphones, in car, anywhere. Just randomly pauses.

Lastly, I wish playlist organization and editing was MUCH better. It‚Äôs extremely horrible in its current state. There‚Äôs no columns to sort songs by, and you can‚Äôt move multiple songs at once. Totally inefficient.

I‚Äôve used the built in feedback seemingly dozens of times, and I realize this is google which is a massive company, but it seems feedback goes to no one. So I‚Äôm forced to write a negative review. Sorry guys. | Does not put loop button behind pay wall, unlike Spotify | I have to reboot my phone almost every day to get this app to stop hanging. Force closing it doesn‚Äôt work, only a reboot. It‚Äôll just get stuck on pause and if I hit the play button it will just pause again. It‚Äôs fine until the most inconvenient time it could do this. I get the service for free through GoogleFi for now, but honestly I‚Äôd rather just pay for a reliable service. This app is too unreliable for me to continue using it.

The Apple Watch app is a downright travesty. You can‚Äôt play music from it to your headphones without your phone. So much for using this for running without your phone. | For some random reason the app pauses my music and it is not by accident. It happens periodically for no reason whatsoever. As well as when I have my music on shuffle it repeats the shuffle, as in it doesn‚Äôt go through all my songs just a small portion. It‚Äôs also hard to tell when it is on shuffle cause the indicator doesn‚Äôt change much. It‚Äôs switches to a bold font which I don‚Äôt even know if it means it‚Äôs on shuffle or off shuffle | The biggest problem this app has is the apple watch app. Like come on even a third grade app like Gaana has the option to select songs from the list but Youtube which is owned by Google can‚Äôt develop that simple feature. Are you kidding me? 

It‚Äôs 2024 bring out the Song listing in Apple watch app. | It‚Äôs nice how YouTube music allows access to more songs that you can‚Äôt get with Apple Music or Spotify but it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me is how YouTube music will change songs that you already have set up in a playlist for example: 

On YouTube I create a playlist with certain song titles that are ‚Äúclean‚Äù and play clean on YouTube but on YouTube Music it switches the same exact songs with the explicit versions sometimes it replaces the entire song altogether with a different version of this song and that makes no sense to me. 

Just super frustrating so I end up using you to more so for playing music since I have YouTube premium. but I definitely prefer YouTube music over Apple Music at least YouTube music doesn‚Äôt get rid of songs | Paying premium and now I can‚Äôt skip songs? Used to be able to skip using car buttons or bluetooth devices, now only letting me skip 10 secs‚Ä¶wow, just wow. | I cannot download this app without putting in my billing information which is weird cause I‚Äôve never paid for anything on this app | Needs improvement when it comes to functionality on the Apple side. I still don‚Äôt understand why there isn‚Äôt a standalone YouTube Music app on the Apple TV 4K and when trying to use airplay, I can only play one song or a video as soon as the phone goes goes to sleep. There are two reasons why I personally use YouTube Music. 1) I subscribed to YouTube premium (no ads are fantastic) and for a few dollars more I can get YouTube Music. 2) The videos, YouTube music crushes, any other streaming service when it comes to music videos. I absolutely love to just put on a playlist filled with videos, new and old but again, if the phone goes to sleep that all ends. If Apple were to release a YouTube competitor I would go all in on the Apple ecosystem.( still no fix for music videos, cutting out when using airplay from iPhone or iPad to Apple TV!!!) . KIDS MUSIC!!, having kids music stop playing when I‚Äôm trying to search for music or edit a playlist is NOT a feature, developers please change this‚Ä¶) | When comparing this to the other service that rhymes with ‚Äúmodify,‚Äù it‚Äôs like the bit rate on many songs is reduced to below 128kbps. Even when switching from auto to 1080p for these songs it‚Äôs like all the low end is missing and the songs sound harsh and bright. I wish there were more transparency in the app about the quality of audio being served so I can have a choice of where I want to hear it. Very frustrating. | I‚Äôm a paid subscriber and have been with this app for almost a decade, but suddenly when I try to play songs that I‚Äôve uploaded from my own library (which was one of the big draws back when Google Music first launched, before rebranding as YouTube Music), they just endlessly buffer and never load.

I‚Äôve submitted a help ticket and was very detailed with my notes and yet I was still redirected to the wrong support team, then bounced to two other support teams before being told I‚Äôd have a follow up from a 4th support team within 48hrs ‚Äî and never received any follow-up.

About to move to Apple Music. At one time, Google Music was the best streaming app around, but ever since the YT Music rebranding, they have absolutely spiraled and I‚Äôm not alone. If you go on their Reddit page you‚Äôll see many topics from frustrated former Google Play Music users who miss the superior instant playlist algorithms (I only ever get served the exact same songs and artists now no matter what track I click on to generate an auto playlist).

The quality of this app as well as the customer service is unacceptable. | Nothing now sets this apart from normal music streaming. Adding a paywall to click on the song you want to listen to is a major downgrade. In fact this update did not improve my youtube music experience, it made it worse. | Add support for shortcuts. | I like overall app but I see a lot of room for improvement. First off all please integrate LLM into it. So that AI and pull various new songs for me instead of searching for playlists. Also please introduce easy to add it to fav s why is it so terrible, it feels like an experience from last decade. There are many more bugs please connect with me if your Product Manager is interested in hearing. | In my opinion the best music app. I love it.        Carol Ann Melton | This has to get rid of the stupid ‚ÄúWant your music to quit stopping.Buy YouTube premium to keep your music off screen‚Äù like I‚Äôm not gonna buy a stupid subscription just to get some off screen music and some ad removal for YouTube and YouTube music get rid of the thing where I have to buy off-screen music like if it‚Äôs gonna do that then might as well use Spotify where it‚Äôs FREE to listen off screen so get rid of that and I then only I might give it a 4 | Not sure if there was an update, but when I plugged my phone into the car, I can‚Äôt skip songs with the traditional buttons on the steering wheel or the radio

All it shows me is a 30 second skip, it only does it on my iPhone, not my pixel.  I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs just a glitch, but I can‚Äôt figure out how to turn it off | The music selection is seemingly endless. I have found almost everything I‚Äôve looked for. They give a lot of room for downloads, the app doesn‚Äôt take up much space, and it‚Äôs easy to use. My only complaint is that it will only play 20 or so songs on a playlist and then it will auto play whatever else after that. I could complain about cost, but it‚Äôs not bad enough to make me close my account. | Title says it all. The appeal of YouTube Music was that it was much simpler and straightforward than the other apps. Now they‚Äôre trying to make ‚Äúsamples‚Äù a thing just like how YouTube was ruined with shorts. | We need cross fade on youtube music!!!! | I absolutely love YouTube music it‚Äôs fast convenient and no ads üôåüèºbut the only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars because It likes to reply a lot of the same music when I‚Äôm looking to discover something new but besides that and the price. If it continues to go up I will sadly have to cancel my membership | If YouTube music plays songs automatically, like from a radio playlist, it will only include the clean versions. There is no way to change this setting. I‚Äôm switching to Spotify. | I‚Äôve always have been able to skip forward to another song in my car till recently I‚Äôve tried skipping a song and it‚Äôs changed to fast forwarding a few seconds into the song. Now I physically have to unlock my phone and go into the app to skip a song.
It‚Äôs not convenient to skip 30 seconds into a song so please change this!üôè | Guys I repeat do not spend $14 every month on a Platform that should be way cheaper then that ‚Ä¶. Music doesn‚Äôt pair up with a platform like Netflix or Disney+ so why should we pay $14.99 every month to listen to music ??? $10.99 was bearly ok ‚Ä¶. But $14?!!!!! Yeah | please support apple carplay shareplay | Need skip back not fast forward
At least make it an option have to unlock phone just to skip a song | I can get to all of my songs so easily. It‚Äôs like a cheat code for music. I just search the song I want to hear and it‚Äôs there. | Now skips in increments instead of to the next track. Broken. | I DO NOT want to fast forward. I want to skip to the next song. Just like many other users. SWITCH IT BACK!! | I can only fast forward through a song now, it will not let me skip on Apple CarPlay. Why do I pay for premium if I can‚Äôt skip songs now? I am canceling until this changes. | I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs been going on with this app? I‚Äôve used it for years and love it however, recently it‚Äôs just buggy and doesn‚Äôt load. I would open the app and it would show a black screen, couldn‚Äôt search music or anything. Finally the page loads normally and can play music but playlists, downloads, etc. won‚Äôt load. If you want to download a song or add it to a playlist you have to hit the button over and over again or refresh the page to get it to work. Also what is the point of having a downloadable offline playlist if you can‚Äôt listen to it offline? The premium subscription price gets increased while the functionality of the app degrades. How does this make any sense? This app is a headache anymore, I don‚Äôt want to have to go to another music app and make playlists all over again there but that‚Äôs what it looks like it‚Äôs coming to. | Anyone else just getting a completely blank screen? Just updated to the most recent version, then tried deleting and reinstalling but still no luck. :-( The regular YouTube app is working fine. | i love this app but the bugs make using the app a NIGHTMARE. like right now, for no reason that has to do with wifi/data it wont load my liked playlist | Why‚Äôs am I getting a black screen on the YouTube app? I have updated the app, uninstalled and reinstalled. Why can‚Äôt I use a service I‚Äôm paying for? This is very disappointing. | I have had YouTube music since google play went down.

Tried using the Eventbright app, with no success!  I need my tickets tomorrow! | It‚Äôs well documented that there have been several organizers trying to host events for a showing of the movie, ‚ÄòWhat is a woman‚Äô, only for eventbrite to shut down the events. Eventbrite accused the film of promoting hate, but a senate investigation found that eventbrite hadn‚Äôt even watched the film. They just flat out censor their political opponents. | The fees that are charged is my only issue.  They are to highüòí | Great online company! | I am disappointed that the app has least features than online. The app does not give the options to filter the searches & this extremely frustrating. It‚Äôs the reason that I don‚Äôt really utilize the app as often as online. | Makes getting into events easy. | The icons, the gender options.
There are only two possibilities. Learn biology. | I couldn‚Äôt find my tickets even though I can see them on web. I couldn‚Äôt even contact support because it kept telling me to disable my popups. I‚Äôm on your mobile app ‚Äî there are no popups. Is this app supposed to be a joke? | Thank you | 2730 MLK Jr Ave SE | It says ‚Äúno connection‚Äù even though every other app works just fine. Waited for an entire week and it still says ‚Äúno connection‚Äù. Yea, right. I‚Äôve seen the website on Google too and it‚Äôs terrible. Most events cost $999 for some reason and they are random events that no one even likes. Also basically every recommendation is concerts | There fake ticketsü§¨ | No reason for this app to exist, other than to line some CEO‚Äôs pockets. | I have missed every event due to surgeries ( surprise-June should be all good-love the app. Thank you | Review | Super easy to buy my tickets for Y&T ‚Ä¶ took about 3 minutes to complete transaction!
Super happy!! | Browsing through the site, I found some interesting events I would like to attend. | This app and its directions were very confusing and very misleading. I finally figured out what to do, but it took me about 15 minutes. And I still was not sure that I had accomplished my task. | I want paper tickets. | This is a must have application for many reasons! 
I am enjoying everything this job application has to offer! 
Thank you,
Your Fan | Thank you soooooo much | The app consistently doesn‚Äôt show me tickets I know I‚Äôve signed up for on my account. I had to creat a new account hoping that would help and it hasn‚Äôt. I try to get support from Eventbrite and I just keep getting sent in endless loops of nothing. Please fix app! | Buyer beware. | There are standards with logging into websites and apps. Adopt them, getting logged into the app to get tickets from a link I had texted to me should not be a difficult process. | No support in the website 
Random problems all the time - no one to talk with 

Only chance is to write in Facebook, where they sporadically give some replies 

If you can - stay away from those incompetent, greedy, nasty service | It is only because I‚Äôm so angry that I‚Äôm going to expend the energy to warn others about this app.
I tried to order 2 tickets for an event, but kept getting an error message every time I submitted the payment.  My wife then noticed we were getting alerts from our credit card company and it looked like the order went through 3 times (matching the number of times I tried to resubmit it).  I also noticed we had 6 tickets showing in my account.
Then I tried to reach someone at eventbrite, but of course like every other company that provides horrible service they give you no option to connect with a human being.  So I have to write it out on a request and hope I was clear.  AFTER I submitted the refund request I noticed that the 6 tickets were NOT 6 tickets at all, but 2 sets of all three options we selected for our 2 tickets, but showed as 6 different tickets.  So I now realized I DON‚ÄôT want the refund that I can‚Äôt take back.  This purchase experience is a nightmare.  How can these processes be so bad?? | This is a wonderful site.   It is so easy to use and can be used to find things to do and to register guests.  It can be used to get a count for a free event or to receive payment for a paid event. Our men‚Äôs  ministry at church just used it to get a count for a free Mother‚Äôs Day event they are hosting for women in the church.  Without Eventbrite this would have been a bear to get a count and give out free tickets.  Love it! | Event Brite is easy. | I was not asked for my annual pass which gives 10% off. | Never had a problem until today, support is non existent. 
The help button drags you around in circles between the web, the app and the App Store. 

Oh well, hopefully I get in to the event 90s style with a print out of the order number from an email 

One star and I wish I could rate it zero | The fee fee + hidden fees. When does it end? This greedy companies just keep charging and charging. Disgusting and predatory. | Excellent course last year.  
And they invited me to this years event in June. | I just bought 3 tickets to Daniel Donato in New Orleans. I got the email confirming this but when I go to my app they are not there. So I bought a fourth one on my iPhone (in the app) and still my app states that there are no tickets. C‚Äômon people this kind of thing is really stressful. Thankfully I have time to get it sorted out, but truthfully, I shouldn‚Äôt have to get this sorted out. You people should be better! ~ Frank | The app loads seamlessly and is always available when I need! Easy and fun to use! | Love knowing where fun events are happening. | Title | My tickest never come to me | You should not allow people to put fake events I drove for an hour looking for it. Did not find it and was not able to contact the organizer send button was grayed out. | The app doesn‚Äôt always give you the option to register or buy a ticket. I‚Äôve had to use a browser at times in order to register. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a known bug or what‚Äôs going on because I‚Äôve heard other people have the same complaint. 

A took off another star because there‚Äôs no easy way to report this in order to get support on it. Only support articles. It says you can email but I saw no way to and I don‚Äôt feel like wasting more time trying to find it. So I came to the App Store to click on their app support link to see if that went somewhere different, but it did not. 

Will add stars back if get a response. But seems unlikely given the overwhelming positive reviews‚Ä¶. | Sooo easy and convenient | Love Eventbrite | Did not allow me to change my email | So I ordered tickets for my sister and I after she had much trouble with the tickets showing up!
It says welcome your tickets are in your wallet 
Nooooo they aren‚Äôt 
My email says view your tickets here‚Ä¶
Nooooo they aren‚Äôt   

So do we have tickets or not? | What a wonderful service our Township does for us and your reservation signup makes the process so organized for us | For the second event in a row, customers were unable to purchase tickets. We had to contact Eventbrite to have them fix the problem. We were unaware customers were unable to purchase tickets until a customer could tacked us. They fixed the issue but without any explanation. Horrible situation causing us a loss in sales. | Why is there even an app if it asks you to login, then it makes you have to check your email for a link that then sends you their website and not the app itself? The app is unnecessary, convoluted, and useless. | Great to purchase tickets but the search functions are clunky. Especially when you are looking for events in other cities. I would love if my search results were more accurate when I search by promoter/ event but it‚Äôs hit or miss.",4.88767,1141380,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f0/c6/6b/f0c66b42-b709-b9d1-8407-137331b14b09/4e383f10-026b-4f48-a8c5-03f521bf0b89_4_APP_IPHONE_55_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/00/c5/33/00c533a9-a4c1-e8dc-fd5a-abaa8751505a/9201f182-089c-43a1-aafd-fe0da29cbd2f_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/42/e3/ed/42e3ed9f-fc02-36d9-e002-836c566e1414/1402e138-7d4d-4b74-af9b-b72f1ccd75c7_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/31/bc/57/31bc5723-6b9a-d227-7dc3-6a0d04f9ae9a/e88c330c-c0fb-4e6e-80c6-ec380e193a3e_5_APP_IPHONE_55_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/62/e1/58/62e158f1-0f45-449f-675c-926741bf190d/7f350f21-dd1d-49e4-b0c3-aac8ef6d56e7_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ec/cd/37/eccd37c3-9f77-a4d6-caca-d7cf8886383b/2832eb2c-2f68-4915-b7dd-ecce9bbfa073_0_APP_IPHONE_55_0.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

They never add a free booking only hinder your movement | Made a reservation through Expedia, it‚Äôs a okay hotel, we checked in 4/25/24 and did not get a room service the next day breakfast mismanagement no plates and utensils. | No terminal number was given to me I can‚Äôt reach anyone.!!! | Not being able to talk to anyone or accomplish anything in the chat now is very frustrating. All I needed was to add someone to my reservation so they could check in but couldn‚Äôt get that accomplished in an hour of trying | Website and app never have updated prices when you are trying to change a booking. They show lots of options with no price difference to be paid but no matter which one you select you get an error. That is because there is a fare difference but they don‚Äôt show you that. You always have to contact customer support to find that out. Disappointed. False advertising | i booked a hotel and added my one key discount and very frustrated because the app didn‚Äôt say i couldn‚Äôt use paypal to pay. i wouldn‚Äôt have booked the room i got without that discount. i filed a claim with paypal to resolve it because your support was terrible and wouldn‚Äôt help me. the lady from your dispute department forced me to close my case. i can‚Äôt believe this if how you do business. | Great stay at the Marriott. Staff was amazing, quick checkin process. Room was small but updated. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant which was really good. Hotel only has valet parking, which was $60. Not a lot of parking options in the area. | The number of errors in searching, page access errors, inability to download to phone, and internal invalid URLs makes me wonder how they stay in business | I never received an email stating that my rewards were expiring or when they would expire so I saved them for a trip I was planning, Now they take it away with no notice and say theres nothing they can do. This is not how you keep customers and I feel like I have been robbed. | Great hotel, with great views. The staff was impeccable, they couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. | The App is a complete failure. When I log into the app it says my email and password does not match. Using the security code fails too. But the website works fine with the same email and password. Customer service tried to blame me saying I must have made some entry error. This has gone on for months since my last trip. Maybe I will use a competing service next trip! | Need ability to get a live person. Need to make a change with no option for it. | Why dont i have options to add a car rental anad or stay on the app when booking a flight? | They are horrible. No matter how hard  you try you will never be able to speak with a representative. They say you can cancel on line. Good luck with that. | Descargue la app pero cuando la abro se cierra autom√°ticamente | The web site seems full of ads and rabbit holes. I found it difficult to get to where I wanted to go. | I loved the room just enough for one person and yes l would return that hotel the Atmosphere was nice. And most importantly the  staff was
Wonderful everyone was so very nice. | This compay provide its services inside the settlements which are built of stolen Palestinian land ! Boycott Expedia | There is no help. I am trying to get two online Expedia accounts merged together as 1. I have an old email and new email but I only need 1 Expedia account. All they want to talk about is my reservation | Delta is horrible   Bought tickets to Rome for my  83 year old and me for June 17 round trip. She has heart failure and had been hospitalized twice we submitted proof and delta would not let me su substitute someone else or refund our money. Told me I could  bring a corpse. Would not give Expedia one star. Expedia would not help at all No credit or 
Money | I love the app and a lot of the amenities but when you have an issue, it is a nightmare, trying to get support that you can actually talk to. | I recently booked a hotel through Expedia. My mistake not checking the reviews first only went by their nice photos.  I purchased the insurance and tried to cancel the reservation but they would not. The hotel was Oy√≥ in Monroe La. Book at your own risk.  

If I could give them some negative stars I would. The guy from the Expedia team gave me a wrong number to some sex line. They were RUDE & VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. DO NOT BOOK | If you miss a lower rate the best Expedia can do is say Sorry | How am I supposed to use the app when it won‚Äôt let me sign into it. | They were very accommodating at checking me in early and out late - I‚Äôll have to say even during breakfast a nice man helped me with my tray- very nice and accommodating during my stay. Would definitely stay again. | i was trying to do something but got this pop up 

stop CTA spam | Beautiful hotel and location. great restaurant delicious food and great staff. | I use iphone13 mini.
I could install the app, but it won't open. Keep crashing. | Elle and Gilly went above and beyond while checking in. | Hertz did not have my rental even with rsvp. Other vehicles available but wanted to charge more instead of honor their rsvp and price. Hertz never again!!!! Went to enterprise more professional and better customer service.  

You might want to check your vendor hertz in castleton Indiana. They are scandalous | I booked a flight and I‚Äôm trying to check the flight times. The app crashes and now it is saying that my flight is confirmed but it won‚Äôt open for me to see the times. | Hotel had no staff after hours and in process of getting refund kept kicking me out of app when switching to get ridiculously long itinerary number and chat is run by people who speak little to no English and inept. First and last time using Expedia app. Before apps they were excellent | This place is great! Very inviting. Smells good. Comfy beds. | Expedia? Or One Key? Or what?
Signed in, but need to sign in again?
Horrible experience | When buying a ticket late. It‚Äôs all good. | If you are looking for peace of mind , don't ever book through Expedia..
They as overall perspective is not responsive..i was surprised to see that they don't have flights on their app for certain destinations..üòèüòèüòèüòèi Booked few trips but I understood now they are overall poor and don‚Äôt want to improve or take feedback , they ll just revert through automated emails or standard formats.. | Unable to sign up and unable to get to my booking.
I would give you a negative star! | Very nice, clean hotel with comfortable beds/pillows. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Plus the location was perfect! Downtown without being right on Broadway, which helps for noise since it is rockin all night. Highly recommend! | Excelente | This app does very little to help with canceled flights or complications while traveling. Generally speaking, it‚Äôs very difficult to get help from Expedia. It‚Äôs easy to book (give Expedia your money) but anything else besides that is painstakingly horrible. If an airline cancels your flight, Expedia simply gives up and says call the airline. | When and where I love this app | The new rewards system is garbage. Between here and hotels.com I‚Äôve spent tons of money and only got 44$ in rewards. I book all my hotels through here or hotels.com and I can assure you that once I burn through the rewards i have left till be using another travel booking system. | I booked three rooms. I received confirmation for 2 but not the third. I sought help. I received an inadequate response and then the typing in the chat was disabled. Now I have no way to resolve this issue. I just spent over 6k and I cannot get any help. | Did not help. did not give me what I requested. something as simple as the customer service phone number. why is that so difficult, I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain to a virtual agent what I wanna talk to real person about. | way to many glitches, i can barely use the app | Five Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è | I had a piece of metal in my meal onboard Korean Airline flight 36 on April 10 2024. I was taking a holiday to celebrate my birthday and the airline failed. They served me metal in my food that broken several crowns and I ended up swallow it. I had to run into the bathroom to go it up the metal so it didn‚Äôt cause a blockage or perforation in my intestines or bowel. Which could have been fatal. The airlines nonchalant attitude could have killed me. The airline sent me an email stating they MAY or may NOT pay for the damages. I wasn‚Äôt even offered a complimentary upgrade or anything. NEVER FLY KOREAN AIRLINE, or do so at your own risk. I will be speaking with an attorney when I get back to the states. This just isn‚Äôt right! | My Expedia hotel reservation was not found while checking in by front desk which made my experience very frustrating. Front desk was able to locate a room at an affiliated hotel for us. I will think twice before going through Expedia again. | Expedia use to have great customer service‚Ä¶.not so much anymore!",4.78841,4129435,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6a/ce/81/6ace814f-a0d4-741e-a0b5-a1dda90d72ac/22d71247-1ca9-4a0c-a10f-d16232e6ad02_US_IP8_OneApp.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/84/08/a1/8408a116-6a5a-e614-3b1c-c356e9cd885f/32df5a9f-02ee-4068-a59e-571db7924ff4_767423-1_BEX_iphone_5.5_-_New_Verison_-_6th_July.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5d/bd/cf/5dbdcf1c-9286-07c3-49c8-2255912b987e/b03ff29b-6cdb-4205-a97b-2b8487a6313b_US-EN_Pricetrack_iphone_5-5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d7/ba/4b/d7ba4bfb-878d-2cd8-7853-d8d36a94dc78/c96c9346-a24b-4112-93fe-e1927727cd5c_Price-Drop-Protection_iOS-5.5_EN-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/f0/a0/26/f0a026e5-0c6b-6022-81dc-4dd5da5768d8/6155a30c-9fb6-40f1-8a7c-1b97e416f63a_IOS-5.5_Chat_GPT_V2__U00282_U0029.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/69/c5/a1/69c5a174-37b3-f0d1-d858-362a570d8d9a/f178561b-515a-4dea-a2fe-7fe595b46729_US-English-IP8-MemberPrice.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/18/da/5c/18da5c43-17e4-a384-5d6f-bfe68f20fbb1/4448871c-3f9c-4d43-b38b-5f73575d4aaa_US_en_IP8_DoubleDip_-_iphone_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/2c/f0/9b/2cf09b11-215b-4b6c-e9f5-f73b8fcb05bf/f5c5e1bc-d81c-46e5-9003-71449dc11c19_US-English-IP8-FreeCancellation.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1b/88/e1/1b88e1c4-bf6e-de8d-0263-8deea3dd05ad/d99d5d54-abaa-48eb-87f0-9cd8fb56e795_US_IP8_TripDetails.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/2d/a1/41/2da14117-d7f2-6507-b9eb-fa07e527ec6a/caea7dc8-7052-4af6-83c7-ec84f1e05ae8_US-En_iPad_OA.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d3/5d/77/d35d778b-54b6-e01a-a97e-c2ca305ec90c/9b7ea08a-446b-446d-9415-4ccdf2bdd9f8_767423-1_BEX_iPad_12.9_U2019__U00282nd_Gen_U0029__V3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/16/aa/74/16aa7410-bf1c-d4c7-79d4-b1269545ff85/44554e23-4095-4367-94a2-a267bd808721_US-En_iPad_PT.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/03/9a/26/039a26be-c469-b01c-c377-bc04499c3724/91677e7e-bec8-4967-9355-92c237f2ad83_Price-Drop-Protection_iOS-12.9_EN-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b1/fb/43/b1fb43e5-1721-cf47-705b-130a5f82d3e6/e8b33856-0e78-45d9-b99f-6afe91f048fc_US-En_iPad_MPC.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/96/83/38/9683384f-5f9a-6d9f-8880-fd27643310d9/ec035600-83a3-4799-876a-06c7991feac3_US-En_iPad_FC.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/00/0e/e5/000ee504-d936-78ed-2255-7b02704d2bc1/f63dad31-49b1-41fa-a435-8c2ee3ee9fe1_US-En_iPad_TD.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iP

Nuff said! | Or the aggravation !  No star !! | Me yes I love it | No recib√≠ los 10 y descargue la app | Me gusta mucho . Es facil para manejar y ver todo en ella.   Gracias | I love this app  and the reward it offers. | It is a pleasure using this for most my purchases. Convenient | Love how easy it is to use | Disappointed to learn that after completing all the steps required, I did not receive my $10 reward. Also, some stores might have many coupon codes, but Capital One Shopping doesn‚Äôt say what the coupons are for or its value! What‚Äôs the point! I appreciate the offers, but if I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs for then its useless to me! I won‚Äôt waste my time putting items in my cart and checking out JUST to see what the coupons are for. Please fix this system. | Seems like they just want you to download the app which is for a smartphone then allow them to see every site you go to but not give the $10 offered. So where is it? | I love this app | Tell Sam Graziano and Michael Amoia thank you | When I go to buy something online, I never know there is coupons, but now with this app it automatically checks for coupons so That I can save money! Awesome app!! | still haven‚Äôt gotten the $10 | Bonus will never load , or pop up , scam to get you to download plus they have fake 5 star reviews | Says you can download the app and add the extension to safari OR (not and) add it to the browser on your computer to get the $10 bonus. Once you do that, it sends you an email telling you that you need to ALSO add the extension on your computer in order to get the bonus, even though it said either/or originally. BEWARE and stay away if you‚Äôre just getting this for the bonus. Not worth the hassle. | I love this app | Customers always love being appreciated! Thank you! | Takes up to 30 days to get the ten dollar sign up bonus, and you only get that if you also sign up on your laptop, or computer. The effort is not worth the reward. All in all bad experience. | Easy to manage transfers. | I love my Capital One bank. They are so good to me. They‚Äôve done everything I‚Äôve asked and then some thank you. | Easy cash back with each purchase | Great way to save time shopping,I recommend everyone to us the app | It‚Äôs been a great journey for me to have my capital one card | This is so easy! Also sush saving! I would recommend for everyone! | ‚Ä¶buyer beware. 

Are there really THAT many fake reviews written in entirely different voices just to tear this company down? Doubtful. 

Run. Run fast and run far. | Me encanta esta app | A great app that allows you to earn rewards while shopping at places you normally would. | Tried all capital one promo codes,
Scam fake fuccck Capital | Capital One your the only one that would give me credit and you‚Äôre awesome thank you CO | I love capital one and all the perks they have to offer | Every time I open the app is says check internet and try again and even with internet and also redownloading it, it doesn‚Äôt work! It was good while it lasted | Excellent service. | Using Capital One apps store first time | Awesome web site | No shops I shop at or already have product from stores listed. Huge letdown! After reading reviews(app over one year old) and the DEVs saying the same thing over and over. I‚Äôm beginning to think this is a scam app not put out by Capital One. Why would they make a separate app when they already have an app to manage your cards. Didn‚Äôt get it or use it, seems like a huge scam app. | Capital one has been a great cr crd so far.  I am glad I now have one.  Thanks | I would not recommend this app, it forces you to enable it in your browser and asks for permission to view data across apps/online. $10 credit/bonus is not worth how much this app wants to pry into my data.

The $10 bonus they offer isn‚Äôt accurate. Once you download the app they want you to ALSO download it onto your computer. Misleading advertising to get you to put this onto your devices. | I have a charge on my account that I don't know what it was for.  I do have two charges for the same merchant but there is a third charge that I didn't make. The name of the company is Bestgifts4- you. | Excellent Bank and it has enough ways for people to make the most of their tools to get Cashback and improvements for their card | Excellent | I love this app, I‚Äôve saved sm money I stg, as soon as I‚Äôm about to purchase something online, they app will come up automatically comparing all the possible codes until it finds one that gives me the lowest price, especially on something that‚Äôs pretty expensive. I don‚Äôt understand why so many people have issues with this app bc it‚Äôs a heaven sent | Low it | It‚Äôs a lie.

1600525061,"com.locket.Locket","Locket Widget","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/locket-widget/id1600525061?uo=4","Locket is a widget that shows live photos from your best friends, right to your Home Screen. You and your best friends will see new pictures from each other every time you unlock your phone. It‚Äôs a little glimpse of what everyone‚Äôs up to throughout the day.
 
HOW IT WORKS
1. Add the Locket widget to your Home Screen
2. When a friend sends you a photo, it instantly appears on your Locket widget!
3. To share a pic back, tap into the widget, take a pic with the camera, and then hit send! It appears right on your friends‚Äô Home Screens
 
FOR YOUR CLOSE FRIENDS
‚Ä¢ To keep things friendly, you can only have 20 friends on the app.
‚Ä¢ On Locket, there‚Äôs no worrying about follower count, just add your best friends and family and live in the moment.
‚Ä¢ With Locket, you‚Äôre able to be real and share photos to the people that matter.
 
REACT TO FRIENDS' PHOTOS
‚Ä¢ Send a Locket reaction to your friends to let them know you saw their image.
‚Ä¢ They‚Äôll get a notification and you‚Äôll love watching the emojis rain down on your photo.
‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt count or track the reactions, so you can be real and authentic without worrying about likes and filters like other platforms.
 
BUILD A HISTORY OF YOUR LOCKETS
‚Ä¢ As you and friends snap Lockets, you‚Äôll build up a history of all images sent.
‚Ä¢ Share them out as photos or use our video recap feature to stitch together the memories of you and your friends, capturing those ‚Äúlove it‚Äù moments.
‚Ä¢ Locket will also make you a recap video at the end of every month with all of the photos you've shared.
 
ADD LOCKETS FOR YOUR BESTIES AND CRUSHES
‚Ä¢ Decorate your home screen with more photos and images dedicated to your crush or your bestie
‚Ä¢ Add the ‚ÄúCrush‚Äù or ‚ÄúBest Friend‚Äù picture widget, and see photos only from that person. Plus, you can send images just to that person too!

Hope this helps

Enjoy :)üíô | I just wanted to do this with my best friend. I ain‚Äôt wanted to invite a whole crew to be able to use the app.. delete | Great app, me and my girl use it everyday. Awesome way to stay connected. I wish we could edit messages or unsend them in the text channel. | Not much wrong with the app LOVE IT!! | Yay | This app is great!!! It‚Äôs so user friendly, and it‚Äôs such a great app for a start to social media!!! You can easily customize it. Although I did have some trouble being able to take a photo, I found that emailing them was a great idea. They responded quickly, and they helped me fix it. Thank you so much for making this app!!! | It‚Äôs okay‚ú® | it‚Äôs not clear who i‚Äôm sending it so it‚Äôs so confusing but it‚Äôs sm fun | i like it a lot, it‚Äôs fun to do with your friends, and family | I love to chat and post with my friends but one thing is that my brother said it‚Äôs just like Snapchat. | this app so far is super awesome to have with my friends! The only thing is that I‚Äôd be willing to purchase a one time fee rather a subscription type. | I love using locket I can share with all of my friends what I‚Äôm doing or what I‚Äôm wearing | Good app but should app group chats | I love it so much it‚Äôs great for friends | It's a cute app, but it's annoying that I had to add people | I wish their was more you could do | Good but it could be the same as Snapchat so we could meet new people and save things in chat. | There is absolutely nothing wrong with this that I have seen I absolutely love this app and I would really consider using if you want to keep in touch with people | Awesome | don‚Äôt let me record | l.o.v.e t.h.i.süíõ | This app could be better if i can see my friends post though my lockscreen! Please thats a good idea | Needs ability to add a photo from photo library, otherwise it‚Äôs great! | It‚Äôs really nice and fun to have! Not to mention it‚Äôs easy to use. I don‚Äôt like however that there is a limit on what your trying to type. Sometimes, i have to put what i want to say into 2 lockets instead of one. I mean, the limitation is smart, but at least make the limit longer instead of like 10 words | Good would recommend | Love locketüòò‚ô•Ô∏è | It‚Äôs stupid you can‚Äôt opt out of inviting 5 other people to use the app. I genuinely would have kept the app and used it if I didn‚Äôt have to‚Ä¶. | I rate locket 4 out of five stars. I think this bc when ever I‚Äôm adding someone new it will take someone off. Like when I‚Äôm at 8 friends. Which I don‚Äôt like. All the other things are great. I recommend it if ur not getting more than eight people! | it's good but i wish that u didn't have to subscribe for all the features. can't we all just get them?? | This is an amazing way for you ands your friends to share pictures | Ok I like this app. It‚Äôs fun.  But the thing I do not like about it that I can only take photos and not get them from my phones unless you bye it | I would say that this is a good app, the only thing I that I would fix is the ability to see the photo you send to someone in the private messages. I would also create the ability to have group chats in private messages. Lastly, I would suggest making longer text on images free. Overall, a great app! | You can talk to your friends and show them what you are doing! They can show you support with a emoji and they to send to you. You can also reply to the photos and chat if wanted to! | I‚Äôm not inviting 5 people in order to use this app.

Waste of time | I took the time to download your app, supporting your business and you punish me by trying to make me invite people. | I love this app it is an amazing app and I would 10/10 recommend!ü©∑ | I really love it but one day it just won‚Äôt work like the picture part was gone it said I didn‚Äôt have and friends and I know I had two then five days late I keep getting notifications and then it wants to work just please don‚Äôt do it again | . | Love it! It‚Äôs so cool and a safe, protected way to communicate with my friends and let them know what I‚Äôm doing | I've had locket for a long time now and it used to work great, but lately it's been glitching a lot. Sometimes the photos i try to take freeze and boot me out of the app, and other times the app just stops being responsive. Also, when I try to make the ""time travel"" videos, all the pictures are black and wont change from that.

My 89 year old Dad‚Äôs favorite thing is to go to Sam‚Äôs and I have to take him every time I go visit. | You finally got the pineapple jalape√±o dip in stock again but the best by date was today! 4/26/24 maybe y‚Äôall will get some more in with a better date! | Fix your app, make ease of use on cell phone improved and I‚Äôll improve rating. | I use Sam‚Äôs Club to purchase snacks for my comic and game store. The scan and go function of the app saves me so much time every visit. It‚Äôs amazing. | I‚Äôm always satisfied shopping at Sam‚Äôs Club. I also get my prescriptions at Sam‚Äôs! | Can‚Äôt think of any complaints at the moment. I‚Äôve never run into bugs. Love the scan and go feature | The app is so confusing regarding payment methods. | It seems like more times than not that every time I go in to buy something , I notice that the prices have gone up yet again. But also the size of what I am looking at to buy decreases.  There has to be an end to it or there will be an end to having many customers. | Sam‚Äôs apparently made a change to shipping with plus. Many items are not available for shipping. As everything is going up , just another way to steal more money and time for us peasants. | I love Sam‚Äôs club online shopping it‚Äôs quick and easy if I need to return I can do it at their store, not UPS | AAAAAA | Stop being greedy and lower your prices! | Sam‚Äôs Club es el mejor en precio y Calidad que la Competencia y adem√°s por ser un cliente plus‚Äôs puedes comprar con env√≠o gratis ilimitado 
Gracias a Sam‚Äôs Club por excelente Beneficio | Most items are out of stock. In store or on line | I was on vacation out of town and didn‚Äôt have my main debit card. Using the app and the two step verification it didn‚Äôt matter even though I was out of state. I was easily able to walk through and shop like I had my card. Kudos | Today 4/25/24, from 5:30-6:30 pm the 2 women at the bakery were very helpful by showing me the size of a whole sheet cake to make sure the order of 11 cakes fits in my car. 
Also, by the woman‚Äôs clothes section, two staff members, Lisa and another woman helped me by searching the boxes to see if there were smaller sizes available for two pieces of clothing I wanted. 
Thank you! | I have plus membership shipping is FREE BUT NOW you CHARGE ME SHIPPING ON CAT FOOD | What could be more efficient than a simple app that makes buying your items and checking out as quickly as possible. Very nicely done. | Very good service I wish that they had all the product all the time | ALWAYS THE BEST STOP SHIP FOR BULK ALSO GREAT DEALS FOR A BIG FAMILY!!!! | I met the manager.  She was so nice. Luv Sams | I personally find it very annoying that there is one worker in particular that always asks to see your membership card upon arrival. I cannot purchase anything without my card so why should it matter. You get stopped and harassed coming in the store and again on the way out to make sure you paid for your items. I think we could do away with the harassment coming in. | I‚Äôm very happy shopping at this location sometime the yogurt machine isn‚Äôt working at the snack counter and maybe that‚Äôs a good thing so I don‚Äôt add the extra calories but overall I really enjoy coming here | What is the point of scan and go if the person at the exit insist on scanning every item I purchased? | When scrolling through my frequently purchased items the app will randomly blip and scroll up to items I‚Äôve already viewed. Sometimes it will scroll me all the way to the top and I have to start over!!! I go over this time and time again when just trying to add to my cart. So frustrating and time consuming.  Fix it please. | Costco u can return up to 10 years if it brakes while sams club only 90 days! | Having kids and being able to scan pay on my phone. Back in the car and back home. Works great for my life style. | Awesome | Life is hard enough without the lives we stand in!!! Scan-n-Go eliminates one of them! | This still hasn‚Äôt been fixed after adding items to scan and go you can‚Äôt check out because the checkout button doesn‚Äôt work. Not sure if it‚Äôs because the phone gets locked, not keeping the phone open the whole time, but have to force close the app and reopen it to check out. Already deleted and reinstalled same thing. | I love my Sam‚Äôs in Bossier City.  The only complaint I have is, there is no manual wheelchairs in the store. Only motorized ones.  I have a special needs daughter that can‚Äôt walk very far.  The last wheelchair that was there, was so worn out, it wasn‚Äôt safe.
I would love to see some new ones in the store.

Thank you,
Deborah Garrison | We enjoy the value @ Sam‚Äôs Club on things we use frequently.  Bathroom tissue, paper towels, laundry detergent. | Please I beg you please don‚Äôt ever stop this self checkout app. It‚Äôs every. Keep making it better.  Now that you all decided to employee less employees (ridiculous) the checkout lanes are out the door. Just horrible and those self checkout machines are a joke! | I went to Sam‚Äôs Club in Winston Salem on Summit Boulevard yesterday to look at the 6‚Äô x 4‚Äô garden shed. A really helpful employee wearing a Vietnam veteran hat showed me the one that was put together that was outside and walked me through the process of purchasing the shed.

He was extremely polite, helpful, and I appreciate his help. It was just what I needed. | I love being able to order items I need when I need them. | Once you put in a credit card, the app does not let you delete it. | Awesome checkout system thank you so much. Blessings everyone you already have.üåπüíïüåπüëë | Had a hard time getting items to load in store | We have ordered everything from an air compressor to coffee, soap and various household items and have never been disappointed. Deliveries have been as scheduled and often before the original delivery date. | What does Sam's Club, a shopping site need with my health and fitness information or my search history? If you use this you are giving them permission to take absolutely everything off your phone including private contact data! People, wake up and start looking at the privacy is for these apps. It's right here on this page! The only way for them to stop stealing our data is for us to stand up and stop using their freaking apps! I don't care if it makes your life easier. You are making it harder for everyone else to stand up. Stand up and say no! Your convenience is not worth the entire user bases data. Every person who uses this app is being incredibly selfish. And you should check your other apps also. | Every time you place an order, you have to add a pick up person when I constantly use the same person they constantly make you put in your four digit code on your credit card. You‚Äôre the only company that does that. | I am very upset that I signed up for a Plus membership to get free shipping only to find out the item that‚Äôs only available to ship is not free shipping!!!
If you don‚Äôt offer free shipping you should at least have it available in store for pickup. 
Karma Probiotic Lemonade Varirty Pak. | I can‚Äôt believe how long it‚Äôs taking you to finish your reconstruction in this store | Love this app makes it easy for shopping and I get great prices that Sam‚Äôs Club | I like the app but do not like that I can‚Äôt search past receipts all at once‚Ä¶ they are broken into 3 categories and online online orders can be searched. Very inconvenient and I don‚Äôt recall if I picked up or bought an item in store when it‚Äôs been a minute since the purchase. | I simply order my Starbucks coffee beans online at SAMS CLUB and order shows up at my front foor in a few days. Cheaper on any online store incl A. Once it arrives, I grind a weeks worth of delicious coffee in my blender and Tadah delicious coffee every morning with $100ss savings drinking starbucks at home.

This is pathetic. They offer absolutely no protection against transactions that are from other states, or other countries for that matter. They let anyone and their momma charge your account without telling you hey! Do you recognize this transaction? You can forget it, they bypass you altogether and give these people direct connection to your bank account. I mean for the love of Pete if my account says I purchased something in my state and in 30mins or so later some Joe Blow makes a purchase in the middle of Ukraine with my card or in another state I don‚Äôt understand how this doesn‚Äôt throw up red flags in the system that says HEY DOPE HEAD MAYBE THIS PURCHASE WAS UNAUTHORIZED! 
I mean if I wanted to support a family in some other country or state I don‚Äôt need y‚Äôall to do it for me, with inflation so high in the world today I‚Äôm pretty sure the Angels in heaven are starting to steal food out of my neighbors pantry. 
We don‚Äôt need any extra financial issues Capital one, we need support. Not every business motive needs to be about the bottom dollar or rigging the terms and conditions and making them thicker than my grandmama‚Äôs family Bible.

Jan 10 I had funds in my acct $85 to pay the merchant, the merchant swiped my card and the merchant stated the charge was declined, they swiped the card again and stated it was declined again so I gave them a different card from another bank and the transaction went through just fine. Laster that evening I received a notification from Capital One 360 that the transaction went through to the merchant. The next morning Jan 11 at 9am I received a notification that the transaction went through again. I contacted the merchant and they told me to contact the bank. I did contact Capital One 360, so they gave me a provisional credit after 10 days of my complaint. April 11, 2024 Capital One 360 reversed the provisional credit sending my acct into the -$85. I have proof where I paid the merchant with another card when the merchant advised me that the card declined twice on Jan 10 and never even swiped the card on the April 11th because of the declination on Jan 10. I have proof of where I paid the merchant on April 11 with another card as well. I called Capital One 360 to have the reversal of the provisional credit removed, they placed me on hold came back to the line and stated nonsense, they do not know why the reversal of the provisional credit was done, and they need more time put me on hold again and eventually hung up.

I have only had this account a few months and have never tried depositing before. | I‚Äôve tried the shopping app and as people mention you never get the bonus.  
But why do I have to decline it EVERY single time I open the app.  
It‚Äôs a good app I love it functionality, except that there are no check images like my other bank. | It won‚Äôt let me reset my password.

It is for $29 dollars. | This app does a reasonable job of tying Capital One‚Äôs hodgepodge of various mergers together. The problem is that the bank itself is one of the worst in the business. It‚Äôs taken over ten years to get a 10% credit limit increase. Other banks I use give generous increases without my having to even ask. Being my oldest account is the only reason I keep them around. | Absolutely without a doubt the worst credit card i have. CANNOT wait to drop them | This company has absolute horrible customer service, they will link your accounts together without your consent, to take money out of them with nothing in writing and no permission given to do so.  But if you call to try to get help after an hour, they will hang up on you because they already admitted they they cannot figure out how it‚Äôs happening and they don‚Äôt want to look into it. | I love banking with Capital One and I love their app! But I worry about using it since it always requires you to update if it‚Äôs even one update behind. If you‚Äôre on the go, out of the country, or short on time/battery/data/whatever, this is an annoying hassle that will come back to bite every user in the butt at some point. | The system for uploading the documents to open a savings account is terrible, and the customer service is terrible and some tell you one thing and others another and the treatment is not good, before you just filled out the application, entered your information and the account was you had at the moment now you have to deal with a person who treats you badly and a system that does not recognize your ID photo ü™™ in no way do you put it or throw away the photo, the whole process is exhausting, With advanced technology and capital one it goes from bad to worse. | Capital One is a mediocre credit card company.  Use other, better established credit card providers.  You will be happier in the end. | I have had Capital one for 10+ years now. Customer Service is great, courteous and helpful. A few times I have requested an increase of Credit or a lower interest rate, nine times out of 10 they come through for me. I highly recommend Capital One. | i‚Äôve had this for app for years i‚Äôve had nothing but problems with it. from not receiving my direct deposit on time let alone early. to not getting my new debit card for 6 months. never thought in 2024 an app could be as useless as this one. but hey at least it‚Äôs not as useless as there support right hahah | Been using capital one for many years, super easy to pay off you balances on your phone. One thing i did notice, is the widgets stopped working, i had one for each of my accounts on my home screen, now they are just black squares. I have tried deleting them and putting them back on, but capital one dosent even show they offer widgets anymore, anyone else having this problem? | Money disappears even when there aren‚Äôt transactions pending. It‚Äôs been happening three nights in a row now! Will b going somewhere else. Capital one steals from you.. | This is the worst app of all 60+ apps I use.  It is never working, no matter whether day or night, outdoors, indoors, on wi-fi or cellular, or sitting directly next to my modem/router.  All I get is ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve hit a snag.‚Äù  I need this app to work consistently, so I can use it every single day.  Would not recommend unless it is completely fixed / usable on a daily basis in the VERY near future. | Crazy that you can‚Äôt use your card for capital one entertainment, what a rug pull after you get a card. You have to use rewards. | Payments slow to post to account and some never show up in history. This has mainly been a problem with auto loan. | Every time you open it, they‚Äôre pitching something to sell you on. Why do I have to keep telling it I‚Äôm not interested in buying a car!!? A big giant ad that you have to dismiss to see your account. Just offering endless ways to get into debt. Thanks Capital One! üòÉ | I have had cap 1 for decades.  They are helpful and their apps are easy to use.  I can‚Äôt praise them enough, especially compared to other cards I have used.  I recommend them to everyone. | It was working for 1 month on my iPhone. Now after I take a picture of front and back, either auto or manual,  it won‚Äôt let me go farther to input the amount and make the deposit. | I can access what I need to, but man does this app need a dark mode! It‚Äôs 2024, nearly every app I use has dark mode. I check my finances first thing in the morning while it‚Äôs still dark and then I open this app and burn my eyes out.

Please add dark mode. Thanks | The app and website are trash. Cannot login without having to change your password each time. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre currently logged in. No help in the FAQ or contact us. Annoying to constantly have to keep changing your password. Even tried to change my username to see if that fixes it, nope. ‚ÄúLooks like we hit a snag‚Äù | I‚Äôm no longer receiving any purchase notification. Can you please address and look into this matter? | They make actually logging into your account such a pain in the butt you can‚Äôt get in to make your payments. Took me 5 months to get back into my account and had to just pay off my card to stop having it negatively affect my credit. | Why am I not getting notifications when my payroll deposits? I‚Äôve got all my notifications on. There is not even an option in settings for this particular one. I never get a notification, email or push, for my work direct deposit. I have to constantly check the app to see when it‚Äôs there. 

Also, please add time stamps to transactions. This is the only banking app that I use that does not have the time stamps for transactions. | Gawd. Every time I log on I have to update the app. Every time. Gets to a point where it‚Äôs not even worth it just use the web site | Literally for MONTHS i‚Äôve been trying to use the app. it used to work and then it just logged me out one day. it works on the website but never the app. TERRIBLE | This app will not let me update so that I can get in and make a payment. The little circle just keeps spinning around and around. I tried to pay online but since I no longer have this card I cannot enter the cvc code. | I get sick and tired of having to do updates on an app that runs just fine. Just stop already! | Please stop messing with the widget. It was all black and then you got it back to working correctly and now it‚Äôs all black again. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing but please stop changing it. It‚Äôs currently messed up again. | Can no longer shop at Walmart so I can‚Äôt use my Credit card and they won‚Äôt help me change it to a regular one so it doesn‚Äôt hurt my credit | Capitol one is a wonderful bank for families and children that need financial guidance please open a capital one cafe in my city most stores that make deposits to capital one accounts have unrealistic policies which only allow 500$ Walgreen‚Äôs daily deposits when capital one policies states 999$ deposits, please get us a cafe so we done have to go through anyone but capital one to make sure our bills are on time can we please get a receipt she‚Äôll like something to help us keep up with what we spent on what and who with different categories please and thank you | I got their travel card to book a trip and didn‚Äôt get the limit needed to book the whole thing. Tried to get a limit increase with making over 6 figures thought it would be simple. They won‚Äôt do the limit increase and the reasoning is because it is automated? Are you kidding me, you don‚Äôt have the technology or the ability to do it manually? This is pathetic. If you have money and want to get rewards, use another card company. | I‚Äôm giving one star because I don‚Äôt want to see close account or cards on my account.  Please make a way to hide or remove them.   It‚Äôs annoying. 

Truly 4 stars for the app and 5 for the bank. | Money in checking for cc payment. After 4 pm Eastern time so would not credit payment until next day. Now additional $35 late fee. Now that put card over lousey low $300 limit and charged $15 over limit fee. 29.99% cannot ever pay off $300 and get out from under. | Before: user could see ebill that is due , amount due, and due date. When entering amount it opened keyboard with numbers.
Now: just a laconic list of payees, no other info. In order to pay the user has to refer to outside info about the due date and amount due. In addition, doesn‚Äôt open keypad. Instead, it invokes regular alpha keyboard. 
This apps has been downgraded in the most important aspects to me such as paying bills. I am very disappointed with the experience as a user.
And the worst thing is that it seems you don‚Äôt care about customers input . Ambition developers would fix this overnight.",4.84938,8055478,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/06/c0/ce/06c0ce71-e0b2-befa-9f44-f4bdab453976/b86453f3-3aaf-462f-8ee7-b24ee004a610_capone_appstore_02_updatedJuly2701_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ae/83/25/ae8325c2-8f9a-5d1a-43e6-cfd8c8d4332d/cca4bf96-11f8-4d23-a0ea-3e55ea7bcb72_capone_appstore_02_updatedJuly2702_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/55/b0/33/55b03351-6ae9-a87d-1c1e-f557aef686bb/fd901bb4-d8a1-4a6d-b81f-86337ef1d38c_capone_appstore_02_updatedJuly2703_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6b/f0/36/6bf03629-2d2d-336f-8753-b9cc65b01906/eec79a07-af8b-4470-9ba7-9a443ac817d7_capone_appstore_02_updatedJuly2704_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/69/7d/cf/697dcf6d-cb0c-4546-922d-ebc295551d51/e0774f9f-d3de-4599-8f0f-3ca081fe54d6_capone_appstore_02_updatedJuly2705_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/96/1a/b4/961ab46c-6ae6-6533-cc3c-e709c9d38eff/61953ff5-eb50-4b5a-990c-ab9ca326087b_capone_appstore_02_updatedJuly2706_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d6/db/ce/d6dbce66-2fb8-d291-ac66-4aee15d25bb8/12dc111b-610f-4ac9-a449-e82c180f50cb_capone_appstore_02_updatedJuly2707_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ab/b0/3c/abb03cec-7d40-4ac0-0f9f-c7e0001c201a/832f6c6f-f4cc-43dd-bcdd-bc0040aba452_capone_appstore_02_updatedJuly2708_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e3/48/fd/e348fd4f-56ed-9ac2-4631-a12b9d638a29/6229ac2f-1b2d-4977-b10c-3babc540d3c0_Capone_iPad_AppStore_updatedJul2701.jpeg.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e7/3b/5e/e73b5ea4-5715-5c73-a705-3be023dada93/9f0f1edd-a046-411c-b27b-b45041ca59a4_Capone_iPad_AppStore_updatedJul2702.jpeg.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/c6/2d/d6/c62dd61b-b082-4234-697f-b603623b3ccc/fe184f8c-4904-4e3d-a592-a6ce801a3e34_Capone_iPad_AppStore_updatedJul2703.jpeg.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/61/fe/1d/61fe1d72-619d-8c91-7a41-d0d28355b451/01b8910f-a722-4581-897d-a1c608c3b1ec_Capone_iPad_AppStore_updatedJul2704.jpeg.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/90/53/94/905394ad-9d69-e860-223a-392f8e6b9ce2/bc5d44e2-0ef8-4112-ae07-0b0677dc11de_Capone_iPad_AppStore_updatedJul2705.jpeg.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b4/45/a7/b445a73e-c2be-7454-316e-fc9ea0f9c3df/a596a4ab-6946-4849-bab3-a24a472767d8_Capone_iPad_AppStore_updatedJul2706.jpeg.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e6/2c/e3/e62ce3ce-ae52-d4ee-c9c6-86ed02e8dcee/80cc92b4-23f8-466a-af49-8b0ade500914_Capone_iPad_AppStore_updatedJul2707.jpeg.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9c/6e/f0/9c6ef0ab-a676-0ba6-9ccc-0435f058b96c/29ede395-982e-4b67-b123-13f8a08863bc_Capone_iPad_AppStore_updatedJul2708.jpeg.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPh

Excellent quality and cute, cute cards!! Love them. | I am thrilled with my purchases. The level of detail is impressive. Beyond pleased with the level of service. I‚Äôll be back. | I love that you can personalize, but once it is in your cart, there is no way to edit if there is a mistake.  You have to delete and start over. | The only thing I cannot stand about Etsy is you cannot talk to a person ever.   The phone number they recode just rings and rings.  I recently had an issue where somebody listed me as a seller.  I am not a seller nor have I ever been a seller but yet nobody can get my account fixed and there is nobody to talk with about this mess. | Picking up this sign locally!! It is on real, repurposed wood, hand painted with love!! I am obsessed.  Thank you She Shack!!!  Worth every penny. | Always able to find the perfect gift for everyone on Etsy! | I love Etsy because when you buy something you get it right away and if you have any problems or questions all you have to do is contact the vendor and they will take care of the problem. | Very communicative and helpful in the design process! | This app is fine for shopping and favoriting. I've deducted two stars and deleted the app because:
1) The red numbered dot that is supposed to indicate when you have a new notification thing is always there. So if it says you have 4 items to review, the dot doesn't go away until you review those items. It's the same on the website and it is annoying. Also if it says you have updates from sellers, that dot doesn't going away even after you open and read them. This wouldn't be a big deal except that it essentially makes the dot meaningless. It's supposed to indicate when you have something new to look at, but if it's always there, it's not doing its job. This is either a bug (which I've reported twice and both times they said they are aware), or they're doing it on purpose to get people to keep going in there.
2) It is aggro about getting people to allow notifications. Every time I sent a message, it asked me to allow notifications. This is user hostile. I shouldn't have to constantly re-affirm that no I don't want notifications. 

I'm picky about the apps I keep on my phone and even more picky about which apps are allowed to push notify me. Using an app is supposed to be a better experience over the website, but that's not the case here. I just use the website instead. | I love Etsy, I love supporting local, everything about it is awesome. But y‚Äôall need to fix the notification system. Notification badges do not disappear from the app for DAYS on end and it drive me absolutely crazy that there‚Äôs nothing I can do besides turn off notification, but I need them on for purchases. Everything else is great tho | I love Etsy and all the beautiful handmade items but I‚Äôm outraged with the delivery cost. Shipping said $4 so why is delivery $30?? | So excited to get this book!  I have followed Susanne‚Äôs work for the past year or so!  She is so talented and I‚Äôm thankful she has created this beautifully illustrated book for my grandchildren!!!  It will certainly be well loved and treasured! | You can no longer see your favorites or a list of favorite shops in the app. When you click on the favorites icon it takes you to a page that gives recommendations based on what you have previously viewed. | When looking for that unique, rare not run-of-the-mill item try Estsy. Never disappoints. | A truly creative, fun online shop! | Love the Etsy app | Ustedes son unos estafadores ,ofrecen uma cosa y env√≠an otra! Los voy a denunciar en las redes sociales para que nadie les compre | Very happy. | Fix this now | Great candy. | Thank you so much! The communication, professionalism, and quality of work is unmatched!!! | Such a beautiful and unique gift. Good quality and it is easy to work with the shop owner/artist.
Many thanks!!! | Can find any custom item I like for parties and more | I don‚Äôt understand why my shipping cost was calculated at $14.99 when I clearly chose the 3.99 option!  There was nothing I could do to change the order! I got over charged by Etsy! | I am a dedicated etsy shopper. as much as I enjoy etsy as a platform for supporting artists, and the simple, easy to use UI‚Ä¶. the latest update ruins such a basic feature that I can only express my disappointment and frustration. 

the ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù category of the app is no longer useable. It used to be very easy to find my favorited shops and items. I am now unable to access my collections unless they are ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù to me. the collections that I am able to access, I can no longer search for items within. this is particularly frustrating for me, as I have MANY items in my ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù collection. I now cannot find items I‚Äôve favorited in the past without scrolling the entire list. why remove such a basic search function for a shopping app?

I‚Äôd rather see the items and shops I‚Äôve already favorited when I go to the ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù tab, than items that are recommended to me by an algorithm. 

please, fix this. | They have great products. I really enjoy everything they have. | Love this app | unique shirts and sweaters and hoodies.  All sizes. 
Great ideas and clothes can‚Äôt wait for my order | They nailed the custom colors out of the park. Very responsive to messages. Great customer service!! | Unbelievably, impossibly incompetent, disinterested, insulting, ridiculous customer support. A disservice to sellers and buyers alike. I'd close my account except their control to do that doesn't work. | Drop dead gorgeous!!! | Shows zero items in fully stocked shops, logged me out every time I tried to log in, and froze every time I tried to add an item to the cart. Stick to using Etsy on desktop, because the app is completely worthless! | I have been ordering to this shop for 2 years. It never failed me the quality, very quick and easy to do business. Thank yu so much! | I have found some really cool stuff on here. The only problem is that I have recently noticed that there are a lot more drop shippers on the app. They just sell marked up products you can find for cheap on Ali express. | So Easy‚Ä¶ | Excellent quality and great seller!  Very responsive! | Can‚Äôt wait to get these for the baby shower for my granddaughter!! | I have loved and used this app from the beginning. Here lately, however, no matter how many times I read my messages, leave a review, look at whatever favorites I‚Äôm encouraged to look at etc., the notifications don‚Äôt go away. They stay on my badge icon, and actually within the app when I open and then close it. Please fix this! | Such a messy app. Nobody minding the ‚Äústore‚Äù. | Morning | The owner of this shop was very kind and helpful. I searched for a hat that says this this is the one that looked the nicest ! | I used to love Etsy but now they, too, have sold out. Pushing certain products rather than actually showing customers what they are searching for‚Ä¶ profit over people. The search results couldn‚Äôt be more off!

AND THE POP UPS couldn‚Äôt be more obnoxious! I can‚Äôt understand why any app/website would think the experience could possibly be enjoyable with constant interruptions & harassment! I would think after the 50th time I said no by exiting out of the same pop up, you would respect my decision but apparently not. No means NO!

RIP Etsy, RIP online shopping & the internet as a whole. | I was scrolling through, looking for a invitation I can use for both, Mother‚Äôs Day and my birthday. When I came across one that only said Mother‚Äôs Day. Very cute, so I sent the seller a message asking if it can be edited, and she quickly responded and had a sample! BETTER THAN EXPECTED! I loved it! | Why does it take so long for an item to delete from my cart? And then when it finally does, my cart disappears?! The review process is way too long, should be an option to write 1 review and have it apply to everything ordered. If I‚Äôm buying 100 digital files I am NOT spending hours writing 100 reviews that take FOREVER to update. Love buying handmade, but the site and app are slow and cumbersome making me not want to purchase anymore. And I‚Äôm sick of the freaking reminders to review. Leave buyers alone, sheesh. | Always loved Etsy. Great place to find unique stuff | I have previously received cards from this seller.  Prompt service, excellent quality, highly recommended! | I just love this shop! Awonderfulwork does amazing work! Always the best deal and the best product! | She she print so pretty!!!! | I purchased something on Etsy and it placed a notification to review the item I received. I‚Äôm pleased with what I received but it won‚Äôt stop at a star rating or the seller and wants a written review. I cannot clear the notification and I find that VERY frustrating

Developer responded and implied that I could just delete the app and reinstall.  The missing piece is that this pain in the rear about doing the review is on the web site is there too.  I do not have faith that it will return.  It‚Äôs really sad too because this hurts the vendors on the platform due to an ill guided change. | I‚Äôve ordered these for my students last year.

They will not refund you for packages you never received. They will not give you your money back. No money back guaranteed. Do not buy | The order delivery date keep changing and No one can wait that long for very small package , seller is rated average and this is not accepted | Great app | Seller shipped the shoes pretty quick but they‚Äôre sitting at the authenticators warehouse (they already determined they where authentic) with no movement on the tracking for a few days and I get spammed with emails all day about products (I do not want to turn emails off because I want my order updates) | Never bought anything off Ebay and i just put in my card info and it was not updating so i deleted the app to download it again. What the heck. | Do not sell anything on here, there‚Äôs scammers everywhere and eBay‚Äôs customer service for sellers is absolute garbage. | Worst place to sell, they have a bigger audience yes but between fees and the clowns being lead by monkeys at the safety and trust department I would make eBay my last resort from here on out. | I didn‚Äôt get my purchase filed dispute and because tracking said it was delivered they kept the charge. But tracking didn‚Äôt even give my address just city. Big hassle and I lost $40. I did not get my product. If you do use eBay only pay with PayPal as they will help you | Best best | I wanted to clear some sports cards out of my closet. I thought on eBay I could do that and make a bit of cash. There are so many fees, I made -$2.45. Do not trust this app | It‚Äôs easy to sell items on eBay and even easier to buy items there. | eBay restricted my account for no reason. I have no outstanding fees. For almost 3 wks I have been trying to get the restriction wiped off my account. Nothing has been done. I am always told that I will get email within 24 hrs but no emails have been sent to me. No one has a clue why my account is restricted. Yesterday I was told it can take 9 months to close my eBay account. eBay has a habit of referring a customer to various CRs and still none of them can provide a solution. I am so frustrated my eBay account is practically USELESS all because of their mistake that they won‚Äôt acknowledge!!!!!! | I‚Äôve been a member of EBay for over 20 years. I‚Äôve always loved perusing a number of goods, sometimes to buy, sometimes to sell and sometimes to check and see if items on other sites are priced right. Lately, I‚Äôve been bummed that the photos that accompany the listings aren‚Äôt showing up. This has happened on my phone, tablet and desktop. Not sure what‚Äôs happening, but hopefully they fix it soon! | Do not use the eBay service.  Year after year, there is less protection for honest sellers against dishonest buyers.  You will lose money because eBay only protects dishonest buyers and ignores long standing honest sellers!!! | I love that it is so easy to reset the impossible to remember password, because we have like 1,000 passwords and it is so hard to remember which one is for each company.

And now we can access eBay with only our face. That is just GREAT!!! And AMAZING!!! | Keep getting signed out. I‚Äôm having to continually sign myself back in and frankly it‚Äôs getting tiresome. Fix it‚Ä¶. | Always a true value education and shopping experience! | I love shopping on EBay, great selection, quality merchandise, I would definitely recommend. | Why can‚Äôt I put a bid in or buy anything?!?! | eBay works hard to keep you happy. If things go wrong they do their best to make it right. That incudes giving you a refund if there is no way to resolve the issue any other way. John | I have two experiences where I purchased a turquoise cuff that was 2k and a piece of art from a separate seller (also 2k for art). 

Contacted sellers because I never recieved the items I ordered, & no response. Never got a refund either. 

Somehow eBay closed my case when I brought this to their attention. One seller is still active, the other must have been a scam.

I don‚Äôt trust this platform and will not use any longer. If they can‚Äôt guarantee these sellers are authentic or hold them reliable for orders not received with NO refund then (over 4k, my loss!) then I would highly recommend not using | Do not use eBay.   You will loose allot of money and most your packages will be delivered to wrong address .  Warning this company gets to screw you. | All that money can‚Äôt fix their app scammers | I love it | Love the Worx products.  This is the fourth one we purchased as they do everything they say.  The kids are happy doing our yards and their own.  Thanks Worx. | App has become bloat, choked with ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù yet lacks BASIC functionality. ePay‚Äôs default search features greatly disadvantage small sellers of used goods in favor of large, impersonal fixed-price PowerSellers of cheap foreign-made garbage. 
 > And have you read ePay‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù policy?!? Have you seen all the info eBay uses to TRACK you?!? (See Apple Store description) 
 > Contrary to its claims, the company DOES share your personally identifiable information with a wide array of companies whom ePay trusts ‚Ä¶ And does so for any purpose it considers beneficial to your ‚Äúuser experience‚Äù. Pure surveillance and data selling. 
 > Now the search screen takes more clicks!! Recent & saved searches now on SEPARATE screens when there‚Äôs PLENTY of room for them REMAIN on SAME screen. 
 > ePay really should consult ordinary users, not just your Silicon Valley propeller head ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. | A lot of affordable stuff on this app it comes in handy and I only had the app for like two days and I already bought like four items because everything here on this app is like very reasonable price. It‚Äôs not over price like other sites for affordable price range. This is definitely for you. | I shop here a lot but it‚Äôs only because of the eBay money back guarantee and their impeccable customer service agents. Not the bot the actual people working at eBay. There are a lot of great items and treasures to find but unfortunately a lot of scammers as well but eBay has always when notified of scammer taken care of them right away and refunded any money I may have given to said scammers. So shop with that comfort we all fall for em (scams) but eBay will give you a friendly knowledgeable person to help you out! | So I was buying on this app. When I purchased it it didn‚Äôt come for days and months so I contacted the seller, guess what he said. ‚ÄúSorry I don‚Äôt have what you bought, I‚Äôll give u a refund!‚Äù Guess who lost 100 dollars‚Ä¶ there should be a way to ban ppl or smth. | I can‚Äôt stand having to sign in EVERY time I open this app - even if I just signed in a couple of minutes ago
About to delete | I haven‚Äôt used the app in almost a year because they won‚Äôt hide my email address.When you make a purchase some sellers just spam you but if you get the right seller mad you get phished!Pay attention | They have the site set up easy to navigate for buyers and sellers. I love eBay. | ALWAYS CHECK YOUR SHIPPING ADDRESS 

The app switched my preferred address to my previous address and now I‚Äôm short $50 plus my packageü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Also the app ALWAYS logs me out after extended periods of not using. Can someone fix these sometime? | eBay struggles to notify you closer to the end of an auction. I lost out because they notified me I was outbid after the auction ended instead of before. Missed out on a great item that I would have happily raised a higher bid. | Es una muy buena aplicaci√≥n para comprar art√≠culos | The international shipping hub is a horrible mess. My item has been sitting there for almost a week and still hasn‚Äôt been sent to me. If you allowed sellers to ship directly to users I would already have my item. If you take on responsibility for logistics, make sure it‚Äôs good. | Sellers buying junk selling at retail price and price the shipping costs at the same as selling price. eBay use to find good stuff at a discounted price, NOT ANYMORE! | Thank you awesome app | The app would be fine except for this insufferable and pointless problem of constantly logging the user out from their phone. Persists even after updates, re downloading, etc. Fix, please. | I love eBay I always receive the best prices for my items
The only thing i wish is that you guys will provide faster shipping speeds 
For items . | ‚ÄòNough said! | Selling on ebay for years, I found it‚Äôs really hard to doing business with eBay‚Äôs irresponsibility . App also is more and more hard to use. Before you can see the messages contents from push notifications, but now have to click app. | With all the thousands of people viewing EBay I figured my satchel would sell I guess not | They seem to have everything I need and I get it on time | Not straight forward at all. | Excelente | It‚Äôs important for me to trust the corporation I order from.

The cost keeps going up. | Personally I love this app the only bad thing is I get tired of the alerts every f0ckin five seconds | Paying a subscription, but does NOT alert me on my phone! | Used to work great. Now it will not connect or let me sign in after I tried troubleshooting. Deleted the app and installed it again‚Ä¶not it just keeps saying that there is an error and won‚Äôt show the sign in page. 

Not very safe‚Ä¶ | I was pretty happy with this app and most of my hardware for ring up until now but going on two weeks. My front door camas become basically useless because it will not sit. Stay set to detect motion frequently versus regularly so I‚Äôm missing lot of motion detection when is this gonna be fixed? | Can‚Äôt open app into live mode. By the time I can see on the app. The people at the front door are gone. | After upgrading all my ‚ÄúFloodlight Cam (2nd Gen)‚Äù stopped reporting status for any shared users.  App just flashes and does not display Disarmed Home or Away status.  I had to remove access to 3 cameras. That defeats the whole point of the app. | A kid watches my wife leave and then comes back and tries to see if anyone is home. I post it and it‚Äôs denied while I get countless lost pet posts every day. Ring doesn‚Äôt care about crime. | I wish we can use the app on our Apple Watch too with all the features. | Never loads | This new update has a bug that doesn‚Äôt allow frequency settings to be saved. Hurry up and fix it | When I enter my username, the continue button is just text and I can‚Äôt get to the password entry screen. I‚Äôve enabled the JavaScript in the safari app and have confirmed that cookies are not blocked, the app still does not work. Customer support does not support! I have sent a number of emails to both the help and support email addresses and no one responds. I‚Äôve also been on two phone calls which were not helpful with resolving my problem, however, the people I talk to tried their best to resolve my problem, but couldn‚Äôt. | Is the real truth the ring app is like good to find later on when you‚Äôre on nothings todo time is not reliable and discontinue models for you to get spend it for nothing you get the same no this is ridiculous | The app has stopped working with iOS 15 on iPhone 6s. Started reporting it could not ID it‚Äôs location. Deleted the app and reloaded it. It installs but will not sign in or create a new account without error screens popping up. WiFi tests at 300 mb. The Ring app is working perfectly on another iPhone in the house.
Update:  iPhone 6s will not accept an iOS newer than 15. Found a Ring FAQ saying they support only newer iOS‚Äôs for security purposes. To their credit, Ring did invite a PM. By then I had purchased I new iPhone and now ring works very well. | The reason I give it one is bc I can‚Äôt sneak out no more üò≠ | I deleted app as advised and reinstalled on my iPhone 15 pro max. Used to work great done update is needed to resolve the issue. Before it was great. Customer service could resolve anything please fix so I can update to a better review | brah | Definitely need to update app to able to have functional iOS app that will allow you to arm & disarm alarm on Apple Watch. Also, ever since latest update a week ago my cameras are showing not connected to WiFi which is not recording accurately. Can not edit motion zones without snapshot photo to turn black. With this being a security product it is imperative that this app needs to be updated frequently to ensure bugs & fixes are corrected in a timely w. | This new version is no good. I getting notifications that says a person been detected at front and back door and no one is there. I tried changing the settings so I don‚Äôt get many but that has not worked either. Please this issue | It keeps changing my frequency settings i put it for frequently it keeps changing it to periodically on its own i had this cam maybe a year now no problems really now I‚Äôm missing events people walking past my door and i don‚Äôt get the notifications or motion detection like i used to i think it has something to do with this new update because before that it was fine | People walking all over my yard and don‚Äôt even even know about it with the setting set all the way up | I just started using the app today and I can say initial set up was a breeze and I really like how easy it was to customize the motion sensor. It‚Äôs actually great that you can view all the cameras on across all my mobile devices. 

 That said however all the upselling and new product notifications in the app are frustrating , new products notifications make the app cluttered and harder to navigate. I know all about your latest products but wasn‚Äôt able to add a user in the family to view the camera before giving up tonight 

Prioritize security and leave the other features off. Is user safety important to Ring? Then maybe you can  move them off the app , if I want to know about new products I should be able just to go to a website or even a separate app with discounts and promotions.  Maybe keep ‚ÄúNeighbors‚Äù on a separate app too. 

This could make a good system great | Imposible to change network. I got a new router months ago and there‚Äôs absolutely NO ‚Äúchange network‚Äù option on the app. Wth. Please fix | The app no longer notifies me about anything, requiring you to open the app to see any alerts you missed. | More stuff . | We have had the doorbell and 3 cameras for at least 2 years and they have performed ok for us. As the cameras get older (or battery?) there is a delay sometimes in delivering notification, but in retrospect the population has increased on our provider service by at least 10k people or more in that time, so it is probably an internet provider issue, and there is no way they would admit it. We liked the price of the equipment and the monthly service when we purchased it, but inflation has hit so adding more cameras is unlikely, until economy improves. Meantime  we will let the cameras and service protect what we have. | This current update is unusable. It loops from loading status to erroring out and I can no longer use it. My phone automatically updates and now I can‚Äôt even go back to use a working app. Please fix. Using the keypad to arm and disarm is inconvenient. But I can‚Äôt even see any video feeds or history on my phone. This version renders the entire security system useless. | As of a few days ago I noticed the app constantly changing my ‚Äúmotion frequency‚Äù setting to ‚Äúregularly‚Äù. I specifically set it to ‚Äúfrequently‚Äù yet for some odd reason it keeps changing back. Also happens when I set it to ‚Äúperiodically‚Äù. Its quite annoying not capturing footage when I need it too. And yes, I ‚Äòsave‚Äô the change but still changes on its own. | Login popup is broken. The continue/return functionality does not work so I cant login to my account. Support website has broken styling and functionality when trying to visit thru the app | On 5G UW connection and it intermittently lags when reviewing hours worth of videos. Cheap service for the price and expanse of the company. | Horrible surveillance system now!  And don‚Äôt bother posting  in the neighborhood watch.  If it‚Äôs serious, it WILL BE DENIED. | With the current version of the app, 5.71.1, I cannot Arm or Disarm my alarm from the app. It‚Äôs been a week, and it is still not working. After spending an hour on the phone with ring on Monday, I still can‚Äôt use the app. When will this be fixed??? Horrible customer service.

It took over a week, but the app is back working.  No idea what changed, just randomly started working again | Not as good as it was and the monthly fees are just to expensive I have 4 cameras and no discounts for multiple cameras looking else where | There‚Äôs too many app updates to the ring app | There are to many updates. And every time I‚Äôm forced to update all my setting go back to default. I don‚Äôt want to know if it‚Äôs going to rain in a few hours. I don‚Äôt want to know that I should be on the lookout for my neighbors cat. I just want to use the camera service for security purposes. Not get an alert every time the sun comes up. | My ring does not detect on time. For example, it does not alert me when I walk out side but it will alert me when I return. 

The ring is not working during 2am and 5am. It's not a connection issue. I restart and it still does not work. 

It is intermittent with detection and alerts. Sometimes the live view does not work when I know it has a connection.

I watch on lg smart tv | Thanks for the live tv | I love this app it was so very easy to sign up as adult as a minor!! (I‚Äôm not like 7 or 9  much older but still a minor and able to watch adult movies!!) it was very easy but I feel they should put a lock type thing for children!! But it is auto on kids and you have to do like at least 3 or 4 things and children are most likely to ask their parents and their parents with say no and they‚Äôll be on kids so makes sense!!!

I think Tubi already does so much for us It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to Tubi to do this for us but if they could add subtitles like perhaps Spanish for me and my familia, or French for the Eiffel Tower lol Tubi would make us all so happy and forever grateful. 

With all due respect one of your many loyal friend | Tubi has some really great movies and diffferent ones quite frequently I like to make some popcorn and cuddle up and enjoy | Absolutely love this app love it love it love it | Awesome  can‚Äôt get any better | The $6 million man  login run TV series. The man from Atlantis TV series.  Genesis TV series. Battlestar Galactica TV series. Batman TV series Superman TV series.  Firefox Clint Eastwood | I love this app | Tubi is a really good app but I hope Annie comes back . Tubi has many great shows that are worth watching and I love the way they all have a great story 

-A fan of Tubiüíõüíú | It has a lot of good movies  has help past the time recommend it to anybody | The reason this app was worth watching was because it was free, but unlike the other free apps it had less commercials now it‚Äôs got as many commercials as other free apps so why watch it feels like there‚Äôs more commercials and shows 90% of the time | Seen an old movie from my childhood that I completely forgot about! Thanks!!! | Wonderful Movies I really like them and I appreciate the ability once again to be able to view Tubi you‚Äôve got great movies. Thank you so much for up offering this free app to all of us with appreciated and God bless you and all your entire staff thank you. | Stop telling me that I haven‚Äôt finished a show when I clearly have! This is getting very annoying. I‚Äôm deleting your app now in order to punish you severely. | Horrible. The movies are horrible.

The app on the surface is fine, but only then did I release how much of a rabbit hole Tubi Kids was. I mean, for starters, you get things like the Doodlebops. You'd think it'd get better than that, right? Wrong! I found this show that lasted like 55 minutes where there was a garage with eight different doors, one with a different color. The red garage opened and out came a car. I expected a different vehicle to come out of the next door, but it was another car. The next door? A car! And the next?! Another car!! That had zero variety. Period. And there's also the KidsCamp cesspit, which has a füòÖkton of random garbage. So it's basically the Walmart version of CoComelon. It's boring and repetitive and feels like it's 2 1/2 hours long, but of course, it's another 55-minute smorgasbord of useless stuff. Overall, this is just a nightmare unto itself. | I love this | Great for watching free tv but the ads are annoying-if there were only 2 ads per show instead of 4 of the same ads shown every time -that would be better | I love y‚Äôall app | Hard to find movies; new app does not have in categories as detailed options as the old one did.  Every day sorting through the same stuff.  The new logo is UGLY all the way including the dot going trough the circle or whatever it is to be.
Purple and yellow together looks bad.   Yellow color while looking to change from and to subtitles hardly visable against white as I stroll to the little square to turn on/off subtitle.
Why would anyone change their logo ??!!!   Bad decision.
Eventually will start paying for some movie chanal to get away from Tubie. | Tubi is absolutely amazing and they‚Äôre selection that they have to share. It‚Äôs quite impressive.. very limited commercials. To be in the number one spot for a long time now.. | Of all streaming channels, subscriptions or not, Tubi has the ultimate diversity of films, shows, & genres of them all. It‚Äôs almost too good to be true how many old, vintage, & foreign films they have that I haven‚Äôt seen before or even heard of. & I thought I was a movie buff before. But got so much more ahead of me here! üëçThanks Tubi !üòä | Just watch TV. It‚Äôs close to the same commercial breaks. Content is slim. | Veryyy good app I enjoy that It has some classics like the ghostbusters and some action packed movies that I enjoy. | Love it! | Worked well until the latest update. I can‚Äôt watch anything because it keeps freezing every few seconds and taking so long to load until it just stops which is not even 5 mins into the movie. Uninstalling because it‚Äôs just a waste of space if I can‚Äôt use it. | The app doesn‚Äôt work on my iPhone 12 no matter if I use my apple or gmail account to log in it play the movie some and cut it off or buffer and I hate that | They have all kinds of good movies and anime for free, old school and new school they have it. Thx Tubi for letting me enjoy some entertainment. | I keep addressing this issue and addressing this issue but you don‚Äôt fix it. When you‚Äôre watching something it stops in the middle of the show.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° | Does not work all the time!!! Needs major repairs | I love all ur movies can you add I am Sam and dreamer on there please | Yes, I am enjoying Tubi | this is the best movie app i‚Äôve ever had! all the reviews are good but none of them are talking about what the money situation is.. it‚Äôs is completely free!! there is a section for search, movies, shows, reality shows, and categories!! all you have to do is make an account so you can save all of your progress of the movies you‚Äôve watch/ are watching, then start watching! i love this app! will definitely be keeping this app for a while!<3 | The main problem with SharePlay is that the ads don‚Äôt synchronize and if the person who doesn‚Äôt have an ad pauses and waits for the other person to finish watching the ad, then resumes when the ad break is done, the app will crash a few seconds later. This happened twice until we figured out a workaround.  We found that we could avoid this by the person not seeing the ad break continuing to watch and when the ads finished for the other person rewind the episode back to when the ad break started. It would be great with SharePlay to have coordinated ad breaks. | Thanks for the movie rating i think it‚Äôs useful | What is going on with the update? It freezes every 2-3 seconds!
Please fix it? | This app is the bomb . | Love the selection of TV shows and movies offered on TUBI.  I watch this channel everyday üí•ü´†üíï. | So many great things to watch all for free!
The commercials are actually good too and no gross liberal nonsense with men dressing up as women like HBO MAX has.
My family and I really love Tubi for being a good streaming service with lots of awesome content for free! | Hi,

I don‚Äôt write reviews much and this is probably one of six I have done in eight plus year's.  

This a great app and probably the best free streaming service.

Large portions of the app are clearly just their website, which makes for a lackluster app experience.

Honestly‚Ä¶ just use the website. | Can‚Äôt access credit card or look at anything unless waiting an hour | The first thing is not carrying in store is frustrating but online portion was obviously easy ‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt seen product yet. Sending a review once I have received order | You can search for any item and it tells you if it‚Äôs available at your store and where exactly to find it (aisle and bay). People actually review most of the products I search on, so I find it useful and contribute my own reviews (they prompt you by email and it‚Äôs easy. | Your app is not user friendly. It is difficult with shipping and it will not stay at my selected store. | I was trying to figure out what color use for my new reformation house and the apps was truly helpful! | Had to enter the information 4 times to get it to accept my gift card! | App froze up for an hour | Terrible | This app has been awful for the past few months causing me to cancel my orders at checkout because it was such a hassle. Too many error codes, sign in/out errors, in stock inventory is usually useless, now PayPal doesn‚Äôt work at all for checkout. I have been shopping around at other stores after coming here FIRST, this WAS my favorite store previously, not anymore. Way too time consuming and cannot complete purchases. Very disappointing. Try Lowe‚Äôs or Ace hardware. | The app keeps trying to go back to different settings for the home store not my location | I love it here. They always have what I need. And, as a DIY‚Äôer, it is nice to only have to go to one place. Thanks!! | This is the hardest online order I have ever done.  I have tried several other times to order different products and given up and ordered from someone else because I couldn‚Äôt get the order to go through.  I hope you re evaluate your online app! | Tried using PayPal didn‚Äôt work kept looping back to home page | No where to type in coupon code when purchasing online. | Ignorant process of making a payment.
Sent me through a loop of entering 6-digit PayPal code 3 x‚Äôs and reviewing the same info over and over and over again before finally processing payment.  STUPID and Aggravating!!! | I love that I can find an item in each store just by opening the app. Awesome work | Would check PayPal put in info and would go back to check out. Did that about 10 times and finally just added a card and it worked. I always use PayPal. | In my cart, it asks ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù or ‚Äúcheck out with PayPal.‚Äù I select the PayPal option, receive my code from PayPal, enter the code and it returns me to the same option ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù or ‚Äúcheckout with PayPal.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt log into my PayPal and finish my purchase. Had to cave and enter my card number, which I hate doing because of security concerns. | When it comes to lawn maintenance need more options | I have been looking into buying an electric pump for transferring water from a 55 gal barrel. I was surprised to see that Home Depot emailed me exactly what I have been looking for. Within less than 10 minutes I completed the purchase order for this pump and I am looking forward to receiving it next week! | Can‚Äôt change store- not helpful | Loved this App and this store. Product Description field now blank. iPhone 7+ using latest iOS . Product Description text visible in Safari results but no longer visible the App. All other tabs are populated. Need to fix this because I get hounded to use the app when in Safari.

Gonna hang a 5 star because I‚Äôm a believer in HD‚Äôs dedication to customer outcome. | Ever since the update I can no longer use the app. It errors out before even logging in. Deleted and reinstalled app and does same thing. | Didn‚Äôt have my current billing information or my address. I have ordered from you numerous time this should be stored on your site. | Quick and easy payment | App fails to sign-in for last several months, and still no fix. Logging out, reinstalling app - nothing works. Seems like mobile auth is broken, that renders app pretty useless | Website gives error codes forbidding access and app issues too.  I cannot even log in and order more of my favorite items and save with online purchases. It once saved time and money shopping online at the website (when it worked). Now, the app also fails to load or allow logging in.  I will go to Lowe‚Äôs, instead. This store costs more but at least I can save my orders and favorite items and have no accessibility issues like I do at Home Depot.  I now enjoy Lowe‚Äôs much better. Lowe‚Äôs probably matches Home Depot‚Äôs prices, too.  Apparently, 1,000 other prior Home Depot Customers also share the same bad accessibility issues with only Home Depot, as I do shared by online discussion boards.  Either fix your website and store apps, or you will lose other customers, too. I will eventually replace your store with others if access continues to be denied online. | The app would not allow me to use PayPal for payment. I had to create an account, enter address and credit card information. PayPal is so much easier and I do not like giving my credit card information out online. | Kinda sluggish | Constantly crashing and freezing.  Order online and they cancel your order & say it‚Äôs out of stock.  Try to make a payment and you‚Äôll be redirected to yet another crashing & freezing Citibank link.  Just awful, go to Lowes! | Poor customer service at this specific location | Home Depot put items online but when you want to pay, they said that the can‚Äôt deliver in store for pick up. For that I bought sinks in Texas to send them in NJ by UPS.
After that I shopped 64 items and I checked out. They credit card canceled the order for security issues. When I resolved the problem with the bank, I m not able to replace the order ( to repay).  I have to shop again. That made me spent a lot of time. | Quick and easy..so far..my first time..fingers crossedü§ûüèª | This will be the third time I attempted to purchase item and after waiting hours they say unable to fill order | Not to happy as the website tells me through the whole process I will get it tomorrow and then when I finally pay sorry you won‚Äôt receive my delivery till 3 days later | The app has some serious issues, especially on checkout. Tried to use pro extra dollars, but it still wants me to add a credit card and billing address. Then it would not let me type in the billing address afterwards so I had to remove it from the car re-add it to the cart add in the credit card information only to add in the pro extra dollars which didn‚Äôt require the credit card. On and on and on. Fix your app. | No info autofill - impossible to search for a store with item in stock - ship to store arrival dates changes drastically upon placing the order ‚òπÔ∏è | very great app, easy to use, and very accurate to follow to find something | Very happy to see them carry the rubber mulch! I was able to shop online and have it delivered for a decent delivery price the same day and was very happy to get that choice. Well done, Home Depot. | This app, generally speaking is great. But some of the dumbest little things that would be caught if any UAT of the app was done - if I search something and then realize I got too many results and want to add another word or two to narrow down the results. I can‚Äôt just touch up in the field and add onto it, I have to retype the entire search, no matter how long because it clears out the search box for no reason. It sounds like a stupid complaint, but if you add up the amount of time that the world has wasted retyping their entire search and time that costs contractors, that one line of code to intentionally clear out the search field is wasting a shi+load of time and money. | I love the App , which I can switch to store mode and know where everything I need is, however, the last 2 times my pick ups were not ready, thankfully Emily took control of the situation and got my products from the Garden Dept.  So she saved the experience. | App is too difficult to make changes | I tried to get a credit card and get a refund. I wasted so much time and was not able to get the refund. Everyone I talked to was not able to help me. It was a waste of time and very unfriendly to the customer. | Fix your system so I can use my PAYPAL ACCOUNT to check out! | I was applying for Home Depot Employment. So I filled out an application and it said to enter password. I too k a screenshot and all passwords were the same.This ridiculous that an apparently a company 332.35 Billion cannot even have a reliable online application. Why would I want to apply for employment if it‚Äôs just a hassle | The app is absolutely horrible. You cannot use PayPal or Apple Pay even though PayPal is an option. | This sealer is outstanding , love the color , lasts for years but this constantly for all my out door wood and used on Hardy Siding AAAAA+++++üëçüèø | Good app. Easy navigation, provided store locations for items, and smooth search options. I wish they offered Apple Pay as a payment option. | I love you and everything you do for me and the great materials",4.81283,2254780,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/59/1a/69/591a69c4-6005-c366-bfca-8e7099a85fea/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/63/e0/89/63e08952-4fa8-ee5b-1bd7-fb5ac4a98511/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/66/68/b4/6668b427-a961-58ff-7ddc-ad78c480a38f/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/86/5e/ff/865effad-8adb-f1d4-ef62-78c589af766f/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8a/31/c2/8a31c2bb-24d9-972f-6631-009a9aecaddc/mzl.xsvtqwka.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/c6/fc/ce/c6fccebc-148d-c69d-027f-07d974f29483/mzl.yqwsamrd.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ac/c8/8f/acc88f57-7332-09be-dc8e-9c8877e44807/mzl.ekqkejto.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/88/74/e9/8874e9c2-cbb3-2d18-343d-0327e605c609/mzl.ssqmiavy.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Please try again. | Chipotle logged me out my account that has 1000+ points and when I logged back in there was 0 points, don‚Äôt waste your time using this app, or eating at chipotle, I will now eat at there competitors restaurants since they have better software ( it doesn‚Äôt log you out and throw away your points ) unlike chipotle | I am frustrated with the app when trying to find the scan at restaurant icon.

However, despite its widespread popularity, Google Translate is not without its flaws. In this essay, we will explore the limitations of Google Translate from the perspective of an individual named Omar, highlighting its inadequacies and the challenges it poses in accurately conveying meaning across languages.Paragraph 1: One of the primary criticisms of Google Translate stems from its inability to capture the nuances and complexities of human language. Languages are rich with cultural references, idiomatic expressions, and contextual meanings that are often lost in translation. As a result, Google Translate frequently produces inaccurate or nonsensical translations that fail to effectively communicate the intended message.Paragraph 2: Moreover, Google Translate struggles with grammatical accuracy and syntax, leading to awkward and confusing translations. Languages vary significantly in their sentence structures and grammatical rules, making it challenging for a machine translation system to generate coherent and grammatically correct output consistently. Omar often finds himself frustrated by the jumbled and disjointed translations provided by Google Translate, which hinder effective communication with others.Paragraph 3: Furthermore, Google Translate's reliance on statistical algorithms and machine learning models means that its translations are susceptible to errors and inaccuracies, particularly with less commonly spoken languages or dialects. Omar, who speaks a minority language, often encounters mistranslations and misinterpretations when using Google Translate, highlighting the limitations of the service in capturing the nuances of diverse linguistic contexts.Paragraph 4: Another significant drawback of Google Translate is its lack of context awareness. Language is inherently contextual, with meanings often dependent on the surrounding words, phrases, or cultural references. However, Google Translate operates in isolation, devoid of the contextual understanding that humans possess, resulting in translations that lack depth and accuracy. Omar frequently encounters misunderstandings and misinterpretations due to Google Translate's inability to grasp the context of his communications.Paragraph 5: Furthermore, Google Translate's reliance on user-generated content and crowd-sourced translations introduces a risk of inaccuracies and inconsistencies. While user contributions can enhance the coverage and quality of translations, they also open the door to errors, biases, and misinformation. Omar has encountered numerous instances where translations provided by Google Translate were misleading or incorrect, leading to confusion and frustration.Paragraph 6: In addition to its linguistic shortcomings, Google Translate has been criticized for its limited support for minority languages and dialects. While the service covers a wide range of languages, it often prioritizes widely spoken languages at the expense of lesser-known ones. Omar, whose native language is not supported by Google Translate, faces significant barriers in accessing accurate translations, highlighting the service's neglect of linguistic diversity.Paragraph 7: Moreover, Google Translate's lack of transparency regarding its translation methodologies and algorithms raises concerns about the reliability and accuracy of its output. Users like Omar are left in the dark about how translations are generated and the factors that influence their quality, making it difficult to assess the trustworthiness of the service. Without transparency, Google Translate's credibility is called into question, undermining its utility as a translation tool.Paragraph 8: Additionally, Google Translate's performance varies widely across different languages and language pairs, with some translations being more accurate than others. Omar, who communicates in multiple languages, often finds inconsistencies in the quality of translations provided by Google Translate, further diminishing his confidence in the service. The lack of consistency adds another layer of uncertainty to the already challenging task of cross-linguistic communication.Paragraph 9: Furthermore, Google Translate's translations are often characterized by a lack of fluency and naturalness, making them sound stilted and artificial. Languages are not merely systems of symbols; they are living, dynamic entities shaped by culture, history, and social interactions. Google Translate's mechanical approach to translation fails to capture the nuances of language usage, resulting in translations that feel robotic and devoid of human touch.Paragraph 10: In conclusion, while Google Translate has undoubtedly facilitated communication and connected people across linguistic boundaries, its limitations cannot be overlooked. From inaccuracies and inconsistencies to a lack of context awareness and transparency, Google Translate falls short in meeting the diverse and complex needs of its users, including individuals like Omar. As technology continues to evolve, it is imperative that we recognize the shortcomings of machine translation systems like Google Translate and work towards developing more sophisticated and reliable solutions that truly bridge the gap between languages and cultures. | This app constantly freezes and doesn‚Äôt work.

Maybe not translation accuracy, but app ease of use, practicality, etc. I rarely write reviews. My latest complaint: why on earth would you not include the romanization of the translation on the typing screen. I get it shows when you click go, but for people who actually need to translate things with different meanings, the romanization really needs to be shown under the language while typing the words/sentences out in real time.

It doesn‚Äôt cost you anything to do it and it‚Äôs really simple, I really recommend it you should try it out on your own. | Good day,
Whatever happened to the paste button on the app? That was the option on the app that I used the most.

Thank you so much ‚ò∫Ô∏è | I thought this app was free , but come to find out that I was getting charged 13.99 a month for this app. Is it free or not. Ummmmmm. | I am disappointed in this app. I bought hair products from the Aveda store that I searched for using the Yuka app and they were rated as excellent so didn‚Äôt scan them in the store. When I got home and scanned them they rated as poor. Yuka‚Äôs response to my inquiry was that there are 2 different formulations but there‚Äôs only one option at the store and online for the Rosemary Mint shampoo/conditioner. They said the products should be scanned in person but that defeats the purpose of the search feature and to purchase products online. I don‚Äôt trust their app. | Love this app it helps keep me in check and keeps me away from things that has additives! I highly recommended this app!  Must have App!!! | Love the app. Sure, it has a couple of things that may need improvement on, but what app doesn‚Äôt. The idea to make you more conscious of what you are putting in your body is definitely achieved. I love how the additives are described in as many layman terms as possible. I also love that the developers of the app are not US base, given that the US could give TWO flying turds about the seriousness of what we eat. 

thank you Yuka. I tell everybody about this app. | I was told about the Yuka app a year ago and I can‚Äôt believe that 1/2 the food I was eating was filled with hazardous chemicals. Thanks to the Yuka app I now scan all the items I buy to make sure I‚Äôm eating good food and not chemicals!! Thank you Yuka!!!! | If you‚Äôre looking for great information on what you‚Äôre consuming Yuka is THE app. It‚Äôs free but if you want to be a Premium Member (comes with some additional features, but isn‚Äôt a requirement like other apps to be able to enjoy the app) they allow you to pick between 3 different prices that are charged yearly. All prices provide the same Premium Membership but it‚Äôs more of a donation to keep the app updated and improving. There‚Äôs a lot of benefits that I can list in this review but I‚Äôll keep it short. | This is a must have app!  Just scan the barcode on food and products to find out if they contain ingredients that are harmful.  
  YUKA does the research and gives you the information to help you find the healthiest options.  Since using this app to check for healthy ingredients I have been shocked by what is in some of the products from companies that I have trusted for years.
  This app has been very helpful and I recommend that everyone try it.  You won‚Äôt regret it! | My dietician suggested this app to me. It‚Äôs amazing . I found the ‚Äúdiet‚Äù foods I was eating contained so much more sodium I needed plus other bad additives and gives great suggestions for alternatives. I now am losing weight again and feeling so much better! | I can‚Äôt believe how many products we eat that are causing cancer, endocrine disruptors and cause thyroid issues. By scanning products, with the Yuka app you instantly see what things are in the foods and products you consume. At least you can decide if you want to eat those foods and put those products on your skin. The app also gives you ideas of alternative items that aren‚Äôt detrimental. This app is a lifesaver, literally!! | If you are concerned about what‚Äôs in your groceries shop no more. This app is great and super easy to use. A must have for wise shoppers. Get it you‚Äôll be surprise at what you WON‚ÄôT eat anymore. It was an eye opener.  Trust me. | Honestly cool app, i love how it shows you things you could replace them items with | Helps me make better food choices, and I have lost weight! Highly recommended! | I use Yuka so often and am so grateful that there is this type of resource available! Highly recommend!!!! | This used to be the best app ever for staying healthy and eating well but company‚Äôs have started bribing them for higher ratings which they‚Äôre accepting | I have been using this app for years now to help me find healthier alternatives to everyday items and it‚Äôs been super helpful for someone like me who‚Äôs really trying to be health conscious. The only thing I‚Äôve become more conscious about in the last year is Cedar Hills, and one thing that you could does not highlight as bad is seed oils such as sunflower, soybean, canola oil, etc. if they add that this app will be 5 stars. | I am a cancer survivor so I do my best to monitor what I put in my body and let me tell you, this app is fantastic for that. I can at easy scan an item in the store and figure out if this is a safe product or not. Not only that but it gives you recommendations on alternatives. Out of 10 I would give this app a 10. Would love to see a lock screen widget to make access that much quicker in the the future. | This app was great when I first started using it a few years ago, but I‚Äôve noticed that it‚Äôs changing its rating on products. It‚Äôs even suggesting products that are full of added sugars etc. I can‚Äôt seem to trust it anymore. | It‚Äôs great to find out what additives are in my food. I‚Äôve been eating a lot more organic foods, so this helps to find what justifies their price tag. 

Now, two things:
1. The rating system is pretty bad. Saturated fat and sugar are not evil. They‚Äôre fine and our bodies adapt to them. I think that this rating system will scare people off of food that isn‚Äôt boring to eat like all the plain items without sugar. 

2. Not their fault, but the ingredients do get messed up sometimes. Like one of the most healthiest milks, for example, somehow had ‚Äúartificial flavor‚Äù mark when the flavor was actually natural. I‚Äôm wondering if there is manipulation going on, but who knows. 

This app is a great supplemental tool to learn more about food. I feel like the ratings shouldn‚Äôt be on a 100 point scale. Just make it 5 with 1 being the least healthy. And don‚Äôt put so much blame on sugar and saturated fat. We do need all kinds of fat. | A great way to keep track of your way of eating. Not only does it give you the ratings and information on the product, but it also gives you alternatives if the product is not healthy. | Wow wow I love this app it make you know what‚Äôs is good for your body and not good for your body I love it thanks so much üëçüî• | This app is great for making you more aware of some of the ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù harmful ingredients in products, but their recommendations are just as bad and they‚Äôll rate them good. Changing the portion size can change the results between two products. It just told me a bread with 4g of sugar per slice is better than a Keto bread I scanned. It will also tell you Arizona fruit punch is better than the tea because the serving size in the punch is like 8oz and less sugar vs the 12 or 16oz of the tea with more sugar. But ounce for ounce, the fruit punch has way more sugar. | I use this app daily. One of the only apps I pay the subscription on to use the extra features. It‚Äôs basically a contribution to support the app and opens up many more great functions. I use the app while going through the store and have found numerous things I thought were supposed to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù that I scanned and left on the shelf. Try it. You‚Äôll be glad you did. My friend uses it as well and lets her little girl scan the items. I think that‚Äôs a great way to make kid‚Äôs conscious of what choices to make and what to watch for. | This app lies too much about food and doesn‚Äôt look at the right stuff and approves bad ingredients pls if watched an ad about this app pls don‚Äôt get it it‚Äôs a scamü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üëéüèªüëéüèª | I would like to think this app is flawless, I use this app for most of my research on products, I learn new things on it and it‚Äôs adjusted to my lifestyle in the kitchen, but I wish this app didn‚Äôt have so many glitches, unavailable timeouts, premium user offline timeouts or not loading altogether, inconsistent readings and score changes!! People can buy or use the wrong product with an untrained eye in ingredients that this app tries to help make easier, it‚Äôs almost there! I want to see this app have more frequent updates to fix these bugs and I‚Äôll happily keep this app! ‚ô•Ô∏è | Yuka is a Great app. Almost everyday i just go around my house and scan random stuff because it‚Äôs fun to do. And each time Yuka doesn't know the product i just add it to the app. My family loves to try new things so this app comes in handy to make sure we aren‚Äôt eating anything unsafe. | Idk if there was an update recently but for the last week or 2, it‚Äôs not giving scores for every category it‚Äôs just giving a total score and then ingredient list. What happened?! I‚Äôm a premium member so what gives? | Great app and super fast connection speed in the grocery store. Yes, it depends on where the signal is however I found that it doesn‚Äôt need that big of a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù for data so even with low data it‚Äôs fast.

2nd are the 0/100. I‚Äôve been avoiding these because you don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs -40/100. I‚Äôve also found the generic store brands have higher ratings than the big business fancy ‚Äúorganic‚Äù ‚Äúwhole grain‚Äù brands. I‚Äôll be there just scanning away as if I work there, doing inventory üòÇ.

Been thanking my nephew every time I talk to him about sharing this app. Permanently installed on all our family‚Äôs phones! Prepare for the ‚Äúred pill‚Äù (new world life changing) - The Matrix (1999) | This app creates unwanted stress in your household.Tried it with my healthy cereal and checked the ingredients first.There were zero grams of sugar in there and 5 grams of fat.Tell me why they said there was 8 grams of sugars and 50 grams of fat! | The first item I scanned was shelled pumpkin seeds and it gave it a super low score of around 38 if I remember correctly. I thought it was quite dramatic but I gave the app the benefit of the doubt. I thought maybe it‚Äôs the peanut oil that‚Äôs making the score low‚Ä¶ No, it got scored in the 30s because of high fat and high calories‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. With this logic nuts are terrible for you! And so is every other thing that‚Äôs high fat and high calorie. Do better. | I scanned 5 items and couldn‚Äôt get a rating for any of them. While I think this is a helpful tool, it really needs to be built out to encompass more products. | Either you live good life and live longer or you live bad and die earlier‚Ä¶ !!! It‚Äôs a choice.

If you want  live longer and enjoy LIFE, you have the right App here.
Since I get this App, my family and friends are HEALTHIER and enjoy life better.

‚ÄúYou shall know the TRUTH and the TRUTH will send you FREE.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy PEOPLE die because of lack of education and knowledge ‚Äú.

Let us celebrate LIFE by making good choices.

May God bless us ALL. | This is amazing. I love it! | This is a very useful app , helps to tell you if  the ingredients inside are beneficial for you or bad . I‚Äôm glad I have this app . Thank you for whoever created such a masterpiece of this app  , so smart . | This is a great app. I love how they break down every ingredient & explain every ingredient in any item. It‚Äôs a wonderful app that I‚Äôve been using since the beginning. I use it at every grocery visit. Love love love this app. It is wonderful. | The scoring method is totally wrong and misleading. The Nutri-Score method backed up by a WHO agency. After all the damage WHO did to the world in 2019, it has negative credibility in all they do. Back to the point, the scoring method weighted too much in sugar, saturated fat and sodium content, too simplistic approach that mislead people. Healthy food is way more than that and can‚Äôt be explained in a review like this. But, for example a high quality raw milk cheese got poor score just because is fatty by nature, without considering the quality of the milk, grass fed cows, GMO presence and other very important factors. People, get better educated, there is a lot to learn, and avoid relying in tools controlled by external sources. Developers, no need to reply to my review ‚ò∫Ô∏è, the app technically is great, just need to use a better scoring method which I understand is very hard and complex (I would say impossible) in today‚Äôs world. Thanks! | I love this app but I wish you could search up products for free it annoys me because some of my products don‚Äôt have a barcode. | To keep healthy | The app gives nonsense ratings to the ‚Äúscary‚Äù macros such as saturated fats, salt, etc. Come on people, if you are not qualified to advise on nutrition, please avoid doing so. | Have run into the same product listed more than once with a different rating.  Exact same product both bad and excellent.  Still love the app but am double checking anything that says excellent to make sure all ingredients on the actual product are listed on the rating. | This is a great app to use if you want to know about food additives. It is however biased to food labeled as organic which is mostly a marketing trick. | I use this app every time I try something new. I've even shared it with people looking at ingredients in the store. 
Sometimes the score is low on a product but I can make the decision if the reason it is low is due to, say, calorie content, which is not a big factor for me.
The additives category is something very important to me and to find out that some of those additives are dangerous is such a plus! | Just started using this APP from a friends suggestion and I‚Äôm loving it. Highly suggest all my friends to use it that are serious about products. | I‚Äôm not the person who leaves reviews for apps but I had to come here and leave one for this god sent. Thank you so much to the creators of this app. Health is #1. | Sign up experience is terrible. No apple id, google, or any other options. Password account doesn‚Äôt trigger password manager to generate and save the password. It‚Äôs not the way to implement auth in 2024 | Hello community of Yuka,

I am a consistent user of Yuka and a premium member. Thank you so much for this app. In a time of corruption in brand deals, advertisements, and data sharing, you have stayed to your roots and have not put profits over your morality. Thank you. I am a member because I support and believe in your project, not because I care about the benefits. But enough with that, let‚Äôs get to the point. I am writing to you to make some suggestions on how you can improve your app and stand out from your competitors. 

It would be incredible if you would consider a company‚Äôs ethical practices in your analysis of food products. Many products (such as products of Nestle and any major cocoa corporation that uses child labor to make their products and many major banana corporations in Ecuador) are known to have unethical labor practices in their production but it still shows them at 100% green (which can be misleading). The ethical rating obviously should not be completely factored in to the red-green healthiness scale of a product and therefore should probably be in its own category, maybe at the bottom of the analysis under negatives or positives of the product. Obviously, this task would require a lot more research into companies and their products, but a feature like this is incredibly unique, sought after, and aligns with your brand. Like I mentioned before, it will also make you stand out from your competitors and you should really consider adding it if you want this project to grow. No one has ever done anything like this before, you can be the frontiers of a safer more just society.

Furthermore, You could also consider using AI to help your app become more reliable and accurate (just something to consider) in its analysis and recommendations. 

Please take the time to consider these ideas. You have already done so much incredible work for humanity with this app, and it is only up from here. Thanks for all that you do,

Aaron Gill | First of all, I absolutely love that the app is free and allows you to scan as many products as you want. As someone who gets doesn‚Äôt enjoy reading labels and tiny text off of a can I find Yuka super helpful summarizing the I ingredients in products. It‚Äôs amazing not only that it can scan food products but also skincare and makeup! I have very sensitive skin and being able to scan products before putting them on my face is an absolute lifesaver! I also love how the app makes suggestions on better products that are just as good as the original. Thank goodness for you Yuka!! ü•ï | Extremely happy with this app!! Easy to navigate and extremely helpful when looking for healthier alternatives at the grocery store.  Unfortunately the USA is extremely liberal with food processing  regulations/restrictions.

I hope you will get this fixed immediately. When I called in they‚Äôve said they‚Äôve been getting calls about this issue all day in fact 4 people called right before me.. can you please fix this | Bad | All these fake reviews, speak the truth the Customer Support is trash it‚Äôs all based in India , Scammer Support they put you on hold for minutes on end and then hang up on you , multiple times so the support is trash , the dasher app itself trash orders will make you drive 5+ miles for 3.50 = 2.50 base pay and 1.50 tip is crazy if you decline the order you negatively effect yourself . If you call support they‚Äôll scold you for not doing the order when the driver isn‚Äôt making anything out of it. Your just driving for free basically.  The Trash Support + the lowwww paying order make it almost impossible to even make 25 working for 4 hours when in reality the side job would only be important if you were making at least 7.50 an hour but the average per hour is less than 6$ crazy ü§Ø | I‚Äôve sent multiple emails, called several times, and still no resolution. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating and I feel like my time and effort have been wasted. I just want to start working and earning money, but it seems like Doordash doesn‚Äôt care about their drivers. I‚Äôm at my wits‚Äô end and considering looking for a different job altogether. It‚Äôs disappointing and disheartening to be treated this way. | Dashing on here is great, the only big downside is most definitely scheduling. Every time I‚Äôve been available to doordash, it‚Äôs always unavailable in the only area I can dash. It‚Äôs very inconvenient and with my mixed up schedule I can‚Äôt schedule a dash. So making money isn‚Äôt that great when you can‚Äôt even dash most of the time. Plus doordash is always accepting more people to dash, causing many dashers to not even be able to work because of so many people dashing in their area. Besides this, it is a good way to make money. | No est√°n cumpliendo con las pol√≠ticas en cuanto a calificaci√≥n, largas esperas en el restaurante, instrucciones de entrega, recibes mal trato del cliente y del restaurante. Est√°n cuidando tanto al cliente como al contratista, y uno finalmente representa al cliente. Te conectan con terceros para realizar entregas y estos infringen todas las pol√≠ticas de DoorDash. | The minimum amount paid to the dasher is too low and something has to change! It should be at least $4 the very minimum(double its current minimum) and people who live far away shouldn‚Äôt be able to take advantage of dashers,the distance should be taken into account. 

 We should NOT BE PLAYING TAG WITH CUSTOMERS, AND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES on top of dasher support! The app forced me to contact customer service, wouldn‚Äôt allow me to cancel the order on behalf of the customer. The customer actually asked me to leave the order on and said she would tell them she never got it so she could get her money back. I went into the app and followed the steps while driving to my next pick up which I‚Äôm now pretty late in picking up, the steps wouldn‚Äôt allow me to remove the order on behalf of the customer so I was forced to contact customer service after already going back and forth with Sonic‚Äôs fuuun customer service. 

 Sonic said the item is unavailable to ask the customer if there was something they wanted to replace it with and I said okay I would call the customer and let her know, the sonic employee then disconnected from my order box. Once getting the customer on the line I called the sonic person back to say hey what can she get as a replacement? She said anything. I get an order from the customer and call sonic back and a male says no they‚Äôre not making smoothies?! Is this a joke I thought! Sonic couldn‚Äôt spare 1 min to tell me the first two times? 

None of this is even my job I‚Äôm a delivery driver. All it takes is some buttons for the store to say an item is unavailable. Or for the customers phone number to be included in the order. This should not be put on me when I‚Äôm already in route driving, I don‚Äôt know every stores menu, etc. You pay me a flat rate to drive the food and grab it and only if it‚Äôs delivered and only if I don‚Äôt cancel. I am NOT PAID HOURLY and even if I did choose your hourly rate pay, I would be losing money on gas and working for free. Makes no sense at all. 
I made originally $2 on a 50 min delivery including my costs for gas and my time I lost a lot of money on this almost hour of time considering a gas station employee makes $18/hour and isn‚Äôt driving their own personal vehicles. 
 After 3, yes THREE phone calls to customer service I got paid $6 for 50 minutes and 6 miles on my car. on top of this my on time delivery rate goes down? I‚Äôm honestly too over dasher today to see if my rates were affected but I‚Äôm pretty positive they were. 

On time Delivery rates- need to be more comprehensive.
 There needs to be a way for RESTAURANTS to contact the CUSTOMER, they are the ones fulfilling the order and making it, I should not be involved in this. Makes no sense.
 ‚ÄúCheck the order‚Äù Can DoorDash not see the restaurant seals the bag? 
 Lots of this app needs a real update.
 
 The Navigation has put me in danger and told me to drive into non-existent driveways. Sent me to gps pins that were nowhere near the customer, their house or anyone‚Äôs house for that matter. Sent me to customers houses even though the customer called DoorDash to make sure the gps was sending me to them, only to find out I am an additional 12-18 minutes away from where they wanted their food delivered. NO ADDITIONAL TIP, NO additional gas money added. None of these were my errors and yet I work for free when they happen and lose money on gas. 
 The app allows you a VERY SMALL window to pick up and also deliver. It‚Äôs precisely the time it takes to arrive and it doesn‚Äôt allow extra time for stores that take longer etc. quite frankly the allotted time is a too short a window and should allow a few more minutes for pedestrians, traffic lights, long lines etc. would be lovely if this was also more comprehensive. 
 ‚ÄúActive time‚Äù is sickening quite frankly and should be changed. If we are in the zone and in front of the hot spot store we should be active. If your LYING and saying it‚Äôs busy when it‚Äôs not and letting me sit there I should be paid because you want me on call just in case, otherwise it should not say busy and a hot spot picture shouldn‚Äôt display. I‚Äôve spent hours upon hours sitting with my car running thinking there were things going on. despite the pay being instant it‚Äôs more of money loss then side money maker. 
Even with a Honda civic the wear and tear and mileage make it a very bad deal for drivers 

Stores ignore you if you walk in with a phone in your hand so if food from your order is unavailable on top of that, may god be with you and keep you from getting frustrated 

The app needs a lot of work | the app is frozen up and won‚Äôt let me complete the sign up. | Solo buscas beneficiarse a ellos y a los clientes el pago por las √≥rdenes en su mayor√≠a es muy bajo como hacer 15 millas por 4 d√≥lares o doble orden 4 millas 5 d√≥lares es ofensivo e irrespetuoso para nosotros los conductores, cada d√≠a va de de mal en peor esta aplicaci√≥n y ahora las √≥rdenes para comprar ni se diga 106 art√≠culos 6 millas por 18 d√≥lares cuando en otras aplicaciones el valor de esa misma es de 70 u 80 d√≥lares | Uber guarantees orders, tips, and has a great base pay rather than doordash. This company is very greedy and only offers drivers $2 base pay and tips aren't guaranteed. The mileage vs pay do not match, and the background and ID checks take forever. | They are so strict to mark your deactivation. If you had problems with the same stores over and over. Ask for support without asking they give you reimbursement. But if you try do the paid by the hour sound great but DoorDash doesn‚Äôt like it if you keep continuing either delay or store issues. Doesn‚Äôt matter. They will can you out. What is even the point of pay by hour if you just get canned easily if there was delays? Or forget to mark order. If they want to make it hourly. They should mark you in not taking orders for day or two if you don‚Äôt accept orders. Just give out minimum wage. Even if it forces less pay by the hour. I swear people and companies trying make agreements is like trying get a duck and chicken to make eggs. 

Best to unmark and take a blow to your rating if it affects it. Don‚Äôt ask support for anything. They will give reimbursement often wasting the customer time. They will not make money if they can‚Äôt talk to the store for issues. 0 communication for support and store in placing your dash order for the customer. You think it‚Äôs great having support in a minute while they aren‚Äôt contract workers just hiring techs support. You are contract worker and can be deactivated like a machine. | There are so many fake or illegal account usages in the California Los Angeles area and you cannot prevent it. That's why I don't want to do dasher, even if I do I can't even make money, you have to find a solution to this or you will lose the driver. it's your problem too | I‚Äôve been trying to become a dasher but for some reason I‚Äôm stuck in the legal name area and even when I enter it it sends me back to it | App freezes in middle of delivery and restarting phone or uninstalling app and installing won‚Äôt help | If I pick up an order. I have a big box with ‚ÄûI‚Äòve arrived at customer‚Äú but the directions button is grey and very small. Why?
I pickup I need the direction‚Ä¶
Later I need arrived at customer. 
You have the gps location. You can work with that to know which button is more important at the moment. When I‚Äôm miles away I don‚Äôt need arrived I need directions first‚Ä¶.. | I got as far as downloading and signing in the app but then I get stuck in this forever loop of adding my name. Once I add it, login and verify it‚Äôs me, it won‚Äôt go to the next page and just refreshes back to adding my name. I really was hoping to start dashing this weekend but guess I‚Äôll have to do food delivery with a different company. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Aqui tu duras 1 hora esperando una orden y cuando cancelas por el tiempo de esperas no te dan nada ni para la gasolina que gastaste para ir a esa tienda a recoger esa orden que nunca se te entreg√≥ como ai fuera culpa mia y no de ellos me voy de esta compa√±√≠a le recomiendo uber ets | I like doordash.
Because when i deliver i know where (adress) i am going. Feel safer.
Thanks to doordash. | I was on the phone with DoorDash support and the lady was very rude keep talking over me I said hold on n she got irritated because she interrupted me in the middle of my sentence I know she heard me what is most annoying she said thanks for calling and hung up right away on me | couldn‚Äôt even sign up because every time i‚Äôd ended my first, last, and middle name, it would load for a few seconds and make me enter it again. Could never get past this point | Good working driving app | Too much fraud with drivers, people should not cooperate with this delivery platform. I was just scammed when receiving their order and they showed me information that the delivery was only 5 miles away, but when I received the order, I Items from apple map show up to 8 miles while the delivery amount is only 9 dollars, not only that, the number of orders you deliver from this application does not have a tip and you have to deliver a higher number of miles than the amount you actually receive. is too bad üëé | The most terrible application, I place an hourly order and they give you 15 dollars, but when I arrive they give me 7 dollars, I spent more than an hour on the road and they paid me 7 dollars for 2 orders, it‚Äôs just terrible, grabhub is much better!! | Can‚Äôt even sign up to become a dasher. I have a doordash account and try to sign up but it just keeps looping me back to ‚ÄúEnter your legal name‚Äù i probably entered my name 10+ times now and it still won‚Äôt let me in the app. Idiotic | They don‚Äôt care about your time and effort they don‚Äôt care about the drivers 0/10 for customer service support . 
I‚Äôve been using this app like 2 months and I don‚Äôt want to use it anymore | Over all easy to use easy way to make money on the go but here lately I‚Äôve not been able to make much money as I used to idk why but I can‚Äôt start scheduled dashes and then I miss a nights worth of work and then something dash now don‚Äôt work and now there‚Äôs a waiting period of any where from 3 to 30 minutes waits for an offer it‚Äôs making it very hard to make money I‚Äôve become very disappointed with door dash | I just dropped off an order to a customer and he said the app used to have the national average amount of tip for a delivery but now it doesn‚Äôt even show a tip at all. The customer has to go in and add a tip themselves. Thankfully, a lot of customers do still tip, but why is DoorDash making it easier for them not to tip us at all? | Great app only thing is in app google moves and react slow | With these recent updates. I went from 20-25 an hr to 10-15 an hr. For being top dasher and having great ratings , this is very disappointing. I have over 7500 deliveries.

Update: Something has changed for the better. I am now back up to where I use to be pay wise. I sure hope DD finds a way to keep the better pay offers to the Dashers that put in good work with good ratings and complete orders properly. 

Delivering to customers correct address.
Reading instructions.
Not disrespectful through messages to customers and Dd support. 
NOT  Taking  customers orders and keeping them for themselves because they‚Äôre ‚Äúoffended‚Äù or some other personal issue. 

I really believe DD needs to change their driver requirements to a minimal 3 years delivery experience. And drop any drivers with 3 or more traffic infractions in a 2 year period.  Put more standards on bringing in new drivers. Probably an age requirement as well 21- 25 year olds

Get rid of drivers who constantly have issues and can‚Äôt seem to complete orders. | I‚Äôm just trying to sign up to start dashing and I can‚Äôt get past the page that I have to enter my information for my background check. I am able to enter my information into the boxes but once I have filled it out and I press the continue button it won‚Äôt open a new page I don‚Äôt see any messages on the screen saying that I have entered the information wrong or anything like that. I have refreshed the page and I have put the information in and I am not able to continue | Idk how they gonna do it but DoorDash is gonna fail If they don‚Äôt get better at competing with Uber. Making more than $50 is like a sign from god. | aveses que me cai  un pedido se traba, y luego me dice que perdi el pedido.. | I‚Äôve never had a record until this year and a case is being dismissed and they didn‚Äôt do their research. DoorDash let me make money for almost two months and I have proof that I had a 4.8-5 star rating as a driver. Yet they take away my only way of making money. They aren‚Äôt responding to me and are ignoring my dispute. My communication is great, I show up early/ on time and I‚Äôve never had a single complaint or error while working with DoorDash. Yet there‚Äôs people in my area who can‚Äôt read common English names and hand out food to the wrong people consistently in my area. 

Poor choice of drivers DoorDash. You get good ones and treat them like this your reviews are going to decline. | If you want to wait for more than three hours, without getting paid and offered a trip for five bucks then yeah this is for you . Please don‚Äôt waste your time. | I was a dasher for at least 6 months and hit silver status within my first week. Although I took every ridiculous 2 dollar order that was sent to me to drive 20 miles, my 5 star rating remained and my acceptance was reduced even with me accepting every order and bringing orders on time. Unfortunately, I was badly injured in a serious car wreck, hit by a truck and was out for 3 months. As soon as I bought another car I started dashing again and quickly hit platinum status and was told I‚Äôd be receiving the higher paid offers. That was a lie. I was still receiving 2 dollar orders and wasn‚Äôt allowed to dash when I wanted to as per platinum status said. I had to schedule dashes. What future dashers need to know- you will use more gas than the money you‚Äôll make. You‚Äôll put a ridiculous amount of money into your vehicle for maintenance and repairs. DoorDash will continually keep your tips and steal from you. They will continually keep you driving in circles and you‚Äôll have to put gas in your car everyday. They don‚Äôt care about the drivers at all. I know this because their ‚Äúdriver support‚Äù is a joke and tell you it‚Äôs your fault for what they assign you and if they give you the wrong address, you must be able to be clairvoyant and just know where a customer lives!! This is no longer a good side gig it‚Äôs blatant disregard for the drivers and people who represent DoorDash and I no longer want to be involved in their ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt been deactivated but know lots of dashers who go through what I did and they have seen the same things happen to them as I have had happen to me. When I was hit in the middle of a dash, a very serious accident happened and my body has drastically changed with all the injuries. I called dash support and they didn‚Äôt care and didn‚Äôt even send condolences, nothing! But they did send me constant notifications to go dash while I was in the hospital! I told them what happened in detail with them knowing I would be out and not be able to drive for a while and instead of putting my account on a hold they continued to bomb me with go dash notifications? FYI- support is a joke and they won‚Äôt listen to you and actually I‚Äôve had them make fun of my situation. DoorDash is a joke and I highly recommend that anyone considering wasting their time and money on them to find another gig that actually appreciates their drivers and doesn‚Äôt steal their tips and hard earned money. NO STARS. Unbelievable how a company can be ok with taking from their employees and have no remorse or accountability. Thumbs down, no stars, bad business all around. Friends and myself ran a test on DoorDash to see if they would steal the tips and overcharge us. The test concluded that DoorDash was overcharging the merchant, the customer and keeping the tip. That was all I needed to see. Farewell, see ya, adios. | UPDATES TO APP ARE TERRIBLE! 
(On Purpose?)

They do anything they can to prevent you from earning $ Won‚Äôt you tell you App needs to be updated so you miss orders (it‚Äôs intentional, PrizePicks forces me update their app immediately when an update is available / DD should be the same way but intentionally wants you to miss orders). All about DD making $ and paying you as little as possible (80% of your $ comes from customer tip / DD may pay you $2 for a standard delivery). | They advertise that you can dash anytime but that is absolutely not true! You can be sitting there waiting for an order for about an hour or more. For me I waited almost a whole entire day without getting one single order, and not only that you get low pay ranging from $2+. DASHER SUPPORT IS NO HELP EITHER! Terrible! I recommend watching YouTube about our dasher that currently work for them to warn you before signing up! | The Dasher pay algorithm is a bit lac luster. 
And dasher will also monitor and change how you get your orders to keep you at a specific pay per hour. You can make some good money but it will come at the cost of some outrageous orders | Last night I by sheer chance delivered to my daughter‚Äôs house. I knew she tipped me $7. But DoorDash put that my hourly base pay from them was $5 with a tip of $2. Meaning they took my whole tip and just split it up so they wouldn‚Äôt have to even come out of pocket to pay me. I‚Äôm an older lady and accept all offers and even will wait when things go wrong so my customers still get their food. Many others would unassign. 
I‚Äôm sad. Disappointed-as I looked at other times it looks like this occurred-especially if they sent me 30 minutes away. 
I don‚Äôt know how such a wealthy person could own this company and still be so greedy. Maybe because they just got sued for this and lost. It will become class action again soon. | My background check has been ‚Äúin progress‚Äù for over a year. When I go to check the status it says that it doesn‚Äôt exist. I guess I‚Äôll try Uber eatsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | I have no problem with the Doordash app. It‚Äôs working fine. But lately the in-app maps is getting worse in accuracy and response. Several times it pointed to incorrect house number. And it always pointed to wrong apartment building. Dashers rely on the maps so I believe the in-app map needs an update or improvement. It also can‚Äôt detect some streets/roads. Maybe an update on the map database will help? | Deactivated | New update and 0 orders in 7 hours contact your useless support and we are told everything is working fine just slow and too many dashers on the road in my area. It‚Äôs that way everyday in my area yet all you do is recruit more dashers for our area. Sitting 100 feet from Hotspot McDonalds and I watch multiple dashers going in picking up orders some multiple times but I don‚Äôt receive a single order. | Excelente | I have two days working on the app and of those two days I was active for about 10 hours, of those 10 only three and a half hours are the ones I had deliveries the other hours I have lost waiting in the morning and in the afternoon. I lost gasoline traveling to the points where it marks ""very busy"" and ""busy"". The terrible assistance only told me to uninstall the app and move, it's not convenient to work here, you just waste time.",4.70203,2435530,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/d6/ab/92/d6ab927c-c51a-4ea0-d4e9-bf6abf3f036f/8b4e3d3a-6bdd-4f84-9366-6fdc43f697da_1_1242X2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/22/f7/eb/22f7ebae-739e-25a5-784a-c363c181da77/d72c4a67-48ed-4d57-86b8-d23fe2b417ca_Dx_Evergreen_AppStore_AUS_STA_IOS_5.5_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/80/db/47/80db478f-203c-9f41-742c-0272de768536/7bade4d9-074d-41b4-8a01-657f58360827_5_1242X2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/fb/5b/b2/fb5bb2a2-c131-33d2-33b3-749db94a5ca6/962c669f-f17d-41f8-8f36-59bd2bdae309_1242x2208bb__U00283_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/03/ca/2e/03ca2efc-5a3d-8054-5390-642b5cbc2cde/0aee3af5-e1e3-45e7-b018-aafbec606720_1242x2208bb__U00282_U0029.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I made sure app tracking was on for both apps and even submitted a support request. They responded via mail that they will not award the points, even with me providing proof of completion. Don't believe the hype! | I am disappointed in the point you limit the coupons to scan. I have recommended this app to many people | Es la mejor aplicaci√≥n üòÖ me encanta ‚ò∫Ô∏è | Myself and several other people are unhappy that you took the spin away! | I LOVE this App! | I was doing just the receipts but since I downloaded the games to play , I‚Äôve racked up to 30k plus ! Easy games and earn points . Love it | Trying to get a reward for the purchase of my chewy greeny products through chewy company and can‚Äôt get any help to do a e receipt | Scanning receipts isn‚Äôt always accurate. Receipt corrections don‚Äôt seem to get processed anymore. Electronic receipts used to work for multiple email domains but that stopped. | I used to love this app. So excited to see how many points I would get. Not anymore I get 25 sometimes 35 points. 
Looking to delete and find another worth while app | Love it ! It is a great way to get some type of rebate / reward for your everyday shopping. | Thank you for helping reward people for shopping during this trying times! Appreciate all the offers! | Used to be worthwhile, now it‚Äôs just 25 points per receipt. Too much work to earn points. I‚Äôm not playing games and allowing a tracker. Really thinking of deleting this app. It used to be fun and easy! | This app is Bogos.  I use my household receipts and multiple times they have now declined my gift card redemption stating I am not following rules.  I‚Äôm so sorry I spend as much money as I do and have multiple receipts to claim.  But they are not delivering what they are promising. | Keep saying I broke a rule and cannot say exactly how. Refusing to return my points. This is theft. Dont use this app! | Easy to use and you get points for gift cards.  Awesome! | I have been using this app for 3 months, there are so many glitches and now I can‚Äôt even get on for the last four days. It will not capture receipts at all! crash. I just don‚Äôt think this app can handle this many people and all the updates .  I cleared all my cache on  all of my browsers and phone is up to date .

  What is up with that?? What‚Äôs the reason for taking it a way!!üòû | I love it!!!! | Love this app! My mom & I compete to see who gets the most points per month, I‚Äôve gotten about 95$ in Amazon & other store gift cards, so far this year. it‚Äôs awesome, it‚Äôs like getting paid to do something you‚Äôre already doing! | Great | When the apps are connected to Fetch for rewards points some times it takes a day or two for it to scan receipts when you had purchased something online. | This app hasn‚Äôt worked for me are the games. I‚Äôve had to contact them for support bc nothing is working when I play games even when I‚Äôve directly downloaded it through fetch and allowed the app to connect to other apps.

I love looking for a good deal and I love ‚Äúfree‚Äù stuff!! | Good fun great app | But I love it and not sure why everyone doesn‚Äôt do it. Great idea. | Excellent app love it | I have been a member since 2019 and I love this app! No matter what receipt you scan it is at the very least worth 25 point. Make sure to check the app before shopping. See what is there for the high points. The points from the games are pretty cool, too. I like that better than the wheel that was being used before. The one thing that frustrates me is not having the ability to load my stores that I frequently shop at. ie; CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Aldi, ‚Ä¶ If there is a way I would love to be educated on this procedure. | Amazon is not under maintenance ugh | Very impressed by how fast this app is , how easy to understand & use it. It's the only one I kept of its kind because it was the only one that was clear about what it does! | I love it ü•∞ | I love how you get points to turn into ACTUAL rewards and gift cards and such. Unless you‚Äôre scoring really high plints, you don‚Äôt usually get much, and it may take a while to save up points, BUUUT it‚Äôs perfect for me for when I‚Äôm in a pinch, or if I just want a fun family night. Heck even for date night! And it‚Äôs literally free to do? Heck yeah! | I don‚Äôt always buy their suggested items for points but enjoy really building up them up eventually.

What more could anyone ask for. 
Already plans to return | Why?  Today the condo I rented thru VRBO got canceled. Normally not a biggie, but I was getting ready to leave for the destination 3-1/2 hours away. The day I was to leave they cancelled. They did not offer to help me except to recommend Airbnb. I booked thru VRBO two months ago. They said they would refund my money but it would take 5-8 days. The lady that notified me was polite but could not offer any help. I ended up paying much more for a place on the spur of the moment. VRBO is not being reputable with their clients. They do nothing but offer up sorry. I wonder how they would feel if it happened to them, but they must have plenty of money to pay more and not worry about it. | We had great time. The condo was super clean and comfortable. Plenty of linens and towels. The boat slip was really nice, fishing not so good but will improve. 
Thank You for allowing us to rent for way to short of vacation | Now that Expedia and VRBO are together no one has to answer questions. They each have their own rules with deposits -be careful. Had trouble getting ahold of owners -both told me to contact the other. Hold times are awful. Tried to leave a review it submitted before I was done. No one can figure out how to fix the review. Even though I took out the insurance through Expedia, VRBO still charged me a $1500 deposit then took over a month tho refund it. Can‚Äôt talk to anyone with out 15-30 minute hold. Will never go through this again! | The rental was ready for a when we arrived. Plenty of space for our group. It was a really cute place, close to the beach. It wasn‚Äôt super clean (very dusty light fixtures in the kitchen, cobwebs in the living room) but nice overall | We are definitely coming back to this location again. Everything was absolutely perfect. | We‚Äôve rented many many many coast houses and this is by far our favorite.  Super clean, spacious, well stocked and comfortable.  When our budget allows, we will choose this home again and again.  We are likely some of the easiest to clean after as we respect your home and allowing us in. Thanking for offering a beautiful safe place to stay.  

Maddy Wood | I arrived at our VRBO historic Richmond 3 bedroom home. I was not expecting modern luxury. I was NOT expecting water damaged, peeling ceilings directly over one bed. Nor did I think there should be Sheetrock tape hanging and ceiling paint and pieces on the floor in the sunroom. Furniture advertised on porch not existing and having my car ransacked night one. When I contacted BRBO  my option was to move to an emergency hotel. Maybe they could get 2 rooms since I had guests coming but if I didn‚Äôt accept that immediately I was out of luck. I didn‚Äôt because I had just carried everything in, did not want to carry everything out and wait til
The MIGHT find something. Let me also mention my husband and I are both in our 60s sbd he had recently had hernia surgery and needs a second one so I was doing all the carrying. ALSO I told them multiple times this was my WEDDING week and we we‚Äôre getting married mid week so I didn‚Äôt want to possibly move twice. I was then told I should use my travel guarantee but that was to purchase another VRBO reservation and pay fir it and then submit for reimbursement. AGAIN I did not have those funds available. I will NEVER use VRBO again as I know people who have had less issues and great help rectifying them with their competitor. | You‚Äôre crooked! You DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER‚Ä¶ Only the owner of the property and yourself . You made that clear after my family and I would have had to stay in a high rated crime area and what was around the house! I sent you pictures, I called many, many, MANY times to get someone that can‚Äôt even speak clear English, thanks for ruining our family Christmas. | Difficult to make final payment | The app sent me code but this code is invalid | This home is a dream house! We loved every aspect of it! We are looking forward to our next vacation in AZ and we would certainly book this one again! | I prefer VRBO because they appear to be more fair with the renters. However‚Ä¶less home options are available. So the competitor may get the business due to better home selections and sometimes price. What can you do to drive the homeowners to your business? | The site should list the total price up front without having to do extra clicks. | This was my first time using Vrbo and it will most certainly be my last. The hosts and Vrbo won‚Äôt accommodate if an unexpected emergency arises so you are stuck eating the cost of what you paid. Just stick to airbnb trust me. | We have booked the past two years on the Oregon Coast. There were six of us and two dogs last summer. Had a great stay. | Pagosa Mountain Views never disappoints!  The house is just perfect for two families and has all the amenities you could ever want.  The hosts are so amazing, they make you feel like a family guest.  We‚Äôve already booked this place for next year! | My original accommodation was canceled due to a hot water tank break- VRBO only allows a refund and no compensation so I had to search and rebook a more expensive accommodation with less sleeping space- | We had a wonderful stay‚Ä¶ they had all the amenities we needed and then some ü§ó and location was great for our purpose‚Ä¶ the host was very attentive  too and would stay again!  Thank you! | too excited to say much more‚Ä¶

(üë®üèª‚Äçüîßüìøü•æüåô wow üî¨üéªü™≤üßø) | Be careful booking through this app because I was charged $5,000, called customer service and was told it was a glitch and would be refunded and 3-5 days. 9 days later I still have not gotten refunded. | Thank you for allowing us to stay at your beautiful kind. It was amazing. | I asked as a renter what insured me of last-minute cancellation on properties listed with them as I will be doing a three-month rental and recently heard from a woman that she received a call the day before her rental was to start. She was at a loss about where they would stay and how she would get a refund. I called to see what rights a renter has, and she said they are only a platform for rentals, and properties posted go through no screening process, nor are they liable in any way to get your refund, and have no proof of the validity of a property posted. So yes, they can cancel after they have your full payment. I'm awaiting an answer back from the property owner with my questions. I'm wondering if VRBO is the way to go. There are so many scams, and VRBO has no venting process for whoever wants to list a property. I will do a corporate rental for my time necessary at Mayo Clinic. Buyer beware | What a wonderful house. Nicely decorated with comfortable furniture. House is in a convenient location. The homemade bread and jam were greatly appreciated. 
Would stay here again. | Clunky and cumbersome to use. They advertise specific types of getaways but you cannot search like that!! | Perfect little spot, it was just what I needed. Very tidy and efficient. Location was awesome and I will definitely be back! Host was very accommodating and quick with response to questions. | Mark was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. The cabin was lovely and you can‚Äôt beat being on the water. | I get tire of always having to load an app for every business on the face of the earth that I want to interact with.  For businesses that I seldom interact with (like VRBO), just let me get basic info from your website, without requiring me have yet another app with a sign-on and password that I have to remember. | You need to add a line to enter the vrbo property number in your search criteria. It would help immensely. | This was a wonderful place to stay for the Jersey City Marathon and half marathon! It is very clean and well cared for and had everything we needed. Note for those with mobility issues- there are two flights of stairs to get inside. | Got together with high school friends and had an absolute blast. The house was stocked with everything we needed. We loved the beachouse and plan to stay there again when we come down. | I vacated the owners rental location within an hour due to noise inside and outside of the house. Owner denied a refund, and denied the issues existed. Awful communications and he only responded to my messages when VRBO contacted him first. VRBO customer service did absolutely nothing to help, and the company itself will not watch out for the interest of the renter, only the owner. Furthermore, VRBO allows the owner to charge whatever fees they want. As a single renter, I was charged with an ‚Äúadditional occupant‚Äù fee. Although it was successfully refunded, there is no indication the host was reprimanded or corrected. As long as VRBO gets their money, they don‚Äôt care what happens to you. | The host communicated very well before and after our arrival and Wi-Fi and TV functioned perfectly. We enjoyed our stay there.
Perfect location for us to explore. The pool & hot tub area is very private, beautiful with a tropical atmosphere. 
üå¥üëçüåû | I had originally booked a cabin when My Son decided to come along with us I canceled and was refunded 100% super easy I rebooked a bigger cabin with no hassle at all . I love that they do make it so easy thank God lol!!üòÑ | Start up on app has been weird and still waiting on confirmation on a time sensitive trip it was difficult to get a login in | Love almost everything everything about the app except that it keeps defaulting to a basic search | I love having the  VRBO app on my phone. It makes planning quick an easy when you want an impromptu getaway. Pull up the app browse locations and select. It's literally that easy!! Headed to a weekend getaway should never be hard.  Thanks Vrbo for getting it right ü•≥ Live life and travel because we all work hard, you deserve it. üíï | Enjoyed our stay. | Maybe it‚Äôs me, but the simple search of a specific beach house can‚Äôt be done from the app. If it can, I don‚Äôt understand how. Shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult . | Enjoyed our stay with excellent accommodations. Owner responsive. Right on the beach with excellent conveniences. Unit clean with beautiful balcony view of beach and gulf. We will be back. | Sure won‚Äôt let me tie she‚Äôs search for the property I know I want. | Recently when I used the app, it wouldn't give me prices for any places. I needed to press ""see listing for more details"", and then it never showed me a price. Now, trying it again after a few weeks, and I can't even find a location if I start typing it in. This app is broken and useless. | Great spacious property. Very generous with towels, toiletries, items in the kitchen that you sometimes forget. We really had a great weekend. 

Katheryn and Mike Paradice | Our family enjoyed the apartment for a week. Management was wonderful. We were within walking distance of the Duomo, Uffizi, and so much of what Florence has to offer. The apartment was quiet, spacious, secure, and easy to bring bags in and out of with the elevator. Bathrooms were great and no water issues at all. It‚Äôs a mile from the train station and buses run nearby to get around away from the city center if you like. We would happily stay again. Thanks to Monica for helping when we left something behind! Best wishes! | I set up a new account via the app. No where did it ask me if I am a traveler or property owner. Went to the help tab and it tells me to choose list your property, something that is not there to choose at the top of the page. Very frustrating. | Posted at around $100... final tally $250 and I denied all the extra fees I could!!  Not to mention the extra $1500.00 just in case fee that may or may not get back to me.   YIKES üò± | The property was excellent for our reunion. We had all moved away from the area and returned to enjoy places that we had enjoyed. Half of the group stayed here and half stayed at another Vrbo. We used both homes and met for meals at favorite restaurants. This home was very comfortable, clean and worked well for us. The pool was quite nice and we had lots of room. | One key is awful and forcing you to sign up for it just to use the app is not okay. Why do I need to sign up for two accounts just to use an app?

The viewer experience on YouTube is 1000x better. Twitch, get better | Poor image quality | MAKE IT EASIER. YOU‚ÄôRE MAKING IT INCONVENIENT ON PURPOSE | What a poorly designed glitchy app from a company with billions. This is pathetic. Wanna rewatch a stream, to bad we‚Äôll just keep starting it at the end so you can‚Äôt rewind it. Always crashing, and video quality is pathetic | This app seems to ask to be updated every other day. It‚Äôs insane. Like, if they‚Äôre fixing that many bugs, their QC needs some serious attention. The app is supposed to be basically a browser-in-a-box app. That‚Äôs not rocket surgery, folks. I stream more data updating this regularly than I do actually watching content. Just delete and watch in a browser tab (like Brave to get rid of the excessive ads). Yeesh. | The twitch app used to be the go-to but in the last year that I‚Äôve tried to use it and have tried to communicate in chats.. TRIED. It just hasn‚Äôt worked. The keyboard will not pop up and the entire app is unusable after you try to type once. You have to manually close it and then reopen it again to be able to use any other features. Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I think I‚Äôm just going to uninstall it and only use twitch on the pc. | Can we please, PLEASE get stream analytics fixed it‚Äôs? Going on 3 months of not being able to view stream summary on mobile and it‚Äôs outright ridiculous. If you can roll out these UI changes no one asked for and all these ‚Äúbig fixes‚Äù that don‚Äôt work anyway then you can surely fix the analytics page. Get it together. | I‚Äôve noticed since the update that it‚Äôs buggy. Lagging and hardly working properly | Really need to work on the adds, the app will give you 6 adds wait 30 seconds and give you 6 more. | everytime u try to reply to someones chat the mobile app freezes and becomes unusable | The only analytic I can view is from an old stream from last year. Any recent stream analytics will load forever with no signs of opening | It‚Äôs intuitive easy and fun | 1. Add timestamps to whispers
2. Revert the ‚Äúblock whispers from strangers‚Äù button back to off when creating a new channel. If someone doesn‚Äôt want someone else texting them then the block button already exists for a reason. Turning this on by default isn‚Äôt user-friendly at all.
3. FIX NOTIFICATIONS! 70% of streams I miss because this app never sends me notifications when someone goes live! This has been happening for over a year! FIX IT!
4. Streams by default don‚Äôt save to a person‚Äôs channel anymore after they stream. Why did you change this? How are people supposed to know who is worth following when their channel is blank? Keep a person‚Äôs streams up unless they choose to delete them themselves.
5. After update 8.6.2, you force people to add their phone number just to whisper. Nah fam. I don‚Äôt want Twitch having MY number. It won‚Äôt even let me use a burner number either. Glad my phone is j-broken so I can downgrade the app again. | Twitch is a great app in my opinion but the only thing that makes this app bad is that you get a ridiculous amount of adds. You can get up to 10 15-30 second adds that you can‚Äôt skip. If they reduced the amount of adds the app would be perfect | La configuraci√≥n est√° completamente bien solo cabe que tengo curiosidad quien me sigue ya que tengo un seguidor y siempre ve mis stream puede ser en un rato que empiezo o en el momento eso me da curiosidad quien es la √∫nica persona y no puedo ver quien me sigue ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è busco y busco seguidores y no aparece la lista de la √∫nica persona que ve mis stream y a√∫n no eh conseguido m√°s pero el primero casi siempre cuenta üòÑüòÖ | Beautiful man even better stream | Title, so annoying opening the app and getting told to update again for ‚Äúbug fixes.‚Äù | Late 2023: There‚Äôs a giant ad on the top of the Home Screen now. One star. 

Apr 2024: there‚Äôs banner ads between the stream and chat now. The decline continues | O | Want to scroll down on the list of channels on the left? Good luck, there are constant bugs that freeze that UI for literally 10 seconds, or turn swipes immediately into taps that change what you're looking at, or it will freeze entirely requiring force quitting the app.

Genuinely a better (but still awful) experience using the website on mobile and skipping the app. | I love twitch and watching all my favorite streamers and YouTubers live but there‚Äôs just to many adds for the people who don‚Äôt pay to have them removed sometimes I‚Äôll get 9 adds at a time to I‚Äôm going to miss like 2-3 minutes of the stream every 9 adds | Hi, at first this game was confusing.
But after a while I figured out everything and had so much fun watching the streams and messing around with the bits and stuff,
I think people should download this app now!
Oh ya and even the chat helped me how to use this app which helped me a lot.
Again, I think people should download this app | twitch please stop spamming ads every minute i can‚Äôt even enjoy a stream because of these ads please i beg to at least give ads like every 10-20 or even 30 minutes because i sometimes get back to back ads meaning after im done watching like 4 ads i be getting another 4 ads ü§¶ come on twitch i fw the app bc i got favorite streamers on there but u gotta stop with this ad spamming | Great if you want to watch a steam, terrible if you want to manage your stream little to no options to customize or even manage your account. Better off using a pc. | Isn‚Äôt it weird that you can watch CrunchyRoll and Hulu on Prime Video but not Twitch? Doesn‚Äôt Amazon own Twitch? Wow, what a great way to expand an audience these tech geniuses have devised. So, if you want to watch some Twitch on your TV like a normal person and not hunched over staring at your phone in a dimly lit room like a miscreant, and you have a Roku TV (but don‚Äôt want to run a bunch of cables from your computer or whatever the workaround is) then I guess you‚Äôre just SOoL. I also tried to use the iOS app but after having to reset my password, every time I tried to login, it wanted to send me a verification code. After the 5th attempt of entering in codes that sometimes took longer than the 15 minute reset period just to arrive in my inbox‚Ä¶ I just gave up and uninstalled the app. I‚Äôve watched maybe an entire hour of Twitch since it first launched, and I guess that‚Äôll be the entirety of my Twitch viewing experience. I‚Äôll just continue to watch YouTube for my gaming needs. I give Twitch maybe another year or two tops before it implodes due to its lack of interest and gross mismanagement of even the most Basic of concepts like, since you don‚Äôt have a Twitch app on Roku (dumb) and no Twitch integration with Prime Video (really dumb) and apparently you don‚Äôt know how to use a verification system correctly (so so dumb).  I guess you expect us to watch exclusively on our gaming platforms? But likely if we‚Äôre using our consoles, PCs, or phones(?), we‚Äôre gaming on them, not watching other people play. SMH‚Ä¶ so unbelievably dumb. | Way too many ads! 7-8 ads back to back in a span of 7-10 minutes? I‚Äôm sorry but I rather not watch anything like that! | Out of a 10 the app is 20 for sure I recommend twitch to anyone don‚Äôt matter if your starting or a pro got app üíØüíØüíØ | Every single update is worse | App been crashing lately | Latest update not allowing me to chat. Please help with remedy. | The stream summary will buffer for hours but never loud, y‚Äôall need to fix these bugs | Paid for and free viewing. Yet now they show ads on the app itself. 

What a joke. | One thing that annoys me sm are the ads, theres something wrong with them. I could go into a stream that I‚Äôve never watched and 8 ads will pop out outta nowhere, makes me go like ‚Äúnvm not watching this streamer‚Äù cuz I‚Äôm not eating like 8 minutes of ads in someone‚Äôs channel bc I dont even know if their content is worth those minutes. Also I‚Äôve been watching this streamer which has only 4 ads PER HOUR and many of their viewers have been complaining about getting ads every minute including me, I would watch his stream and after 5 minutes I‚Äôd get like 4 ads, like I watch more ads than the stream itself which is so annoying cuz I cant pay attention to what they‚Äôre doing, they‚Äôve been getting these complains and showed to the viewers that they in fact have only 4 ada per hour so its clearly a twitch problem with the ads üíÄ fr fix this cuz at this moment I‚Äôm watching more ads than streams, like if yalls plan is to get ppl buy ur useless premium no ads thing let me remind yall not everyone has the money to afford or waste money on sum like that!!!! | Upon opening following channel, I want to chat but it freezes and shuts down. If I am streaming a dj channel I cannot input emojis or anything to show I am enjoying channel. This is a pain! 

After update it still freezes when pressing chat | To much ads | Ummm I see I‚Äôm not the only one that‚Äôs having problems with the analytics not loading‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been over a month since this issue. FIX ITTTT | This is a good app to watch all the lives and this is the best app because the lives are so good and I love it thank you for letting lots of lives bye name Jack byereeeeeee | Greatest app of all time. No cap. No glazin. No diddy | it's not bad but could be better | The app is great and I use it a lot, there is isn‚Äôt much complaints BUT there are a few bugs that can be fixed! This has been happening for a while now meaning months and I think it‚Äôs about time that this is taken into action, please fix the mobile bug where it freezes whenever I click off of a stream to enter a new stream‚Ä¶it‚Äôs really annoying!! Also it keeps telling me I am unfollowing some people when I never had so if you could also fix that, it would be really appreciated!!

Lastly, the recent new update for mod viewing on mobile doesn‚Äôt even fit the screen, if you could please make it smaller or something so it can fit the screen it would be way better | As a streamer, this app doesn‚Äôt work properly | Trash | With every update, it‚Äôs a new issue. I can no longer check analytics along with a bunch of other issues that make no sense like the fact that you can‚Äôt see who follows you unless you go on the website | Fun app | Usually, the app runs pretty smoothly, so I won‚Äôt judge too harshly for this. But ever since the most recent update, animated emotes are completely static. Hopefully this can be fixed soon, because I like using the app a lot. | The amount of 9 and 11 back to back ads makes no sense | The ads are awful especially at the beginning of a stream! I dont know if I even want to watch the stream and then bam an ad‚Ä¶ makes me definitely not want to continue watching it just to see if I like it.

$39.99 month | I get the notification ‚Äúhow are we doing?‚Äù Every. Single. Day.  I took the survey but it still won‚Äôt stop. Of course there‚Äôs no support in app. It flashes for a second to click for live chat, but then that option disappears. So I guess I‚Äôll answer the question here: ‚Äúhow are we doing‚Äù - the app has become annoying with the constant notification. I can‚Äôt turn off notifications or else I‚Äôll miss a text. So it reminds me every day how much I dislike this app. | TextNow is exactly what every one need, but may be they don‚Äôt know... if everyone know they will rush for text now instead | Great appp | They will spam you with messages warning you that they will shift your number soon days before they actually shift it. too many pointless messages | TextNow helped me out at one of the most difficult times of my life. If it wasn‚Äôt for this app I would not have had a phone. AND They didn‚Äôt charge me a dime. The Best thing that makes TextNow‚Äôs phone line better than my cellular data phone line. Is‚Ä¶ When my phone dies, or it‚Äôs on air plane mode, or I don‚Äôt have Wi-Fi. Once I get back on Wi-Fi or my phone turned on. I still get an accurate record of my missed phone calls and text messages because it‚Äôs a web based application. I love that. Service has always been great. Thank you TextNow for an excellent App. | It is a great and safe way to communicate with family and friends. | I recently signed up for TextNow & downloaded the app. I sent a new service announcement text to my son. When I opened the app a few days later it showed my number & recent texts & calls but swiftly shifted to a page asking me to choose a new number. ??? I can no longer access my account which is serious as it‚Äôs the number I gave to my physicians & my attorney etc. (as my previous service has suspended my mobile services b/c I refuse to pay hundreds of dollars in trumped-up cellular fees which were incurred due to their tech error issues & now must be dealt with through a law suit. In the meantime, I‚Äôm dead in the water if I don‚Äôt have access to my Text Now services.  Please advise | I've been using this app for 6 years.  The last 4 years it has been my primary cell number.  Never had any problems until today.

I put unique text tone for my most important callers.  Today, one of those tones was running me ragged as I would hear the tone only to see ‚Äúmissed call‚Äù.  This is not a person that would not be able to reach me in other ways.  I could forgive one, maybe two such messages, but 4 in a matter of minutes is too much.  I'm hoping this update will fix that problem. | It didn't work for my YT | They increased prices for everything. Instead small annual pricing they now charge weekly. Pricing now equals to  actual pricing of actual carriers like  tmobile Verizon.. .  Cant be used as long term solution.!!!! | I love it | Waste of time. Waste of Money. And still stranded in Mexico with no service for 2 hours | Excellent | Help I can‚Äôt log in why it saying you can‚Äôt perform how much you can do this meaning how much I can log in I was just using it now I can‚Äôt log into my account please fix this | It took me forever to download the app, it was a husttle to sign in, once I was able to create an account I try to use it in my laptop and it kept saying that the password didn‚Äôt match. So hard to use. And the text take forever to send. | Not working for many social media apps | I got this and got a recycled number at first didn‚Äôt think much of it but then call from the IRS calling for someone else and they have not stoped for at least 4 months and then I got texts from random ppl and got put in a family group chat 2 times and IRS calls during school hours and as a high schooler this is very annoying when everyone looks at you I would not recommend | The app was being buggy so i closed it and when i opened it again it told me i had violated the tos and told me to verify my account even though i signed ip through apple so i dont have direct access to that email i dont care if its stupid that i signed ip through apple, the app should know not to send emails like that when using that choice to sign ip | Excellent customer service | This app is useful for everyone | Best app ever for the call and text | It hasn‚Äôt worked it two days. And when it does, it‚Äôs barely functional.
It‚Äôs been 2 months now. It doesn‚Äôt ring for unbound calls & I can‚Äôt dial out either. | I got a sim on android I‚Äômcurious to see apple differences | Cant get an verification codeü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | It‚Äôs a good app but it all of a sudden started to not let me open the app. It opens for a second and then automatically exits out and i can‚Äôt even use it. Please fix this! | I have been a TextNow+ subscriber for few years. I switched to a new phone and when I tried to login, I received an error message that the account was disabled. I submitted an appeal but never heard back. I then chatted with their customer service. As I was traveling at the moment, they asked me to reach out when I was back in the country. When I reached back today, they told me that the account t had been disabled for 60 days so it was now permanently disabled. I was absolutely surprised as I never received an email before the account was disabled, and never told that I had to call within 60 days otherwise I would lose access to the account. 

Be careful and don‚Äôt use the number for anything important. I am now stuck with accounts where this number was registered, and have to go through the painful process of changing the registered number. 

Very poor customer service and complete lack of communication from them. | Has worked great for me.! | It is a waste of time to download, setup new account and watch 3-4 ads, just to find out I can‚Äôt view or receive any verification codes on free version. Doesn‚Äôt work | I love stalking my ex | I‚Äôm a paying customer who uses textnow as my preferred carrier. I recently started getting banned for sending photos to my group chat with my coworkers and now my account is banned permanently. How can that be that a paying customer is having their account banned? TextNow use to be great. Not so much anymore. Can‚Äôt even use it as a texting service without getting flagged for ‚Äúspam‚Äù even though I pay money for my account to be locked and my phone to be legitimate. Just go through a real carrier their services are better anyways. 

I just renewed my payment on the third of this month and now my account is disabled and they refuse to reactivate it. They say they can‚Äôt see why it was banned (pretty sure that‚Äôs a lie as there are system logs) and they say there‚Äôs nothing they can do to unban the account. 

So I paid you money to keep my account good for the rest of the year and then you banned my account. 

I‚Äôve used TextNow for close to 15 years. Since their existence basically so I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm all the sudden violating their terms of service. | My app is not functioning properly. I‚Äôve tried deleting it and downloading it again, but thats not working. It just wont open. | I don‚Äôt know if sending links are allowed but I have tried to send a very important message from my IPhone to someone using TextNow and when I send it to my own TextNow number I‚Äôm not receiving it. I‚Äôve tried to send it to myself 6 TIMES and the only ones I receive are testers like ‚Äúhi‚Äù and ‚Äúyo‚Äù I am not receiving the important message which includes a link. The message is really long however so I do not know if that is the problem. But from my iPhone it says sent, I‚Äôm just not receiving it on my TextNow number and I have no idea if the person I sent the message to has received it on their end. It‚Äôs an important message but I don‚Äôt want to spam their phone with the same message over and over again. I loved TextNow up until now. | i got suspended for 24hrs for sending too many links i guess & when i tried to get my account back i got an indefinite ban for not clicking a link they sent me in chat that would have given them my ip address i used this service for literally everything so i would like to gain access back as soon as possible please thank you | When ever i do conference call it goes on dead call and both the calls are disconnected, Why is that? | I can‚Äôt even open the app anymore after the new update. It just keeps crashing even after deleting and downloading the app again‚Ä¶plz fix this bug ASAP | I am so glad someone hipped me to TextNow, it‚Äôs the absolute best. | I‚Äôm going to have to switch my business number to google voice because how am I going to take calls or reply to messages WHEN THE APP CRASHES EVERY TIME I TRY TO OPEN IT. Won‚Äôt start at all. I‚Äôve removed the app and added it back, still not working. Not the first time this has happened, getting pretty old. | Developer has responded saying ads are kept minimal - I appreciated the hearty laugh that gave me. Maybe the person responding doesn‚Äôt actually use textnow in the same form free users experience. On my iPhone SE, I can sometimes only read one (1) line of a text message at a time because reading a text has three (3) ads on screen around the thread. It‚Äôs impossible sometimes to scroll without clicking ads. There are multiple popups. If this is minimal, I shudder to imagine what textnow developers would see as heavy ads. The pricing remains insane to escape the ads. 
‚Äîoriginal review‚Äî
Can‚Äôt get texts with emoji in them from many users, including iOS emojis from Google Voice numbers. If you send an emoji-only response, TextNow doesn‚Äôt accept it or it doesn‚Äôt go through. If you send a message with emojis, TextNow loses or removes the emoji! This can seriously change the tone of a message and loses meaning. Even if the basic texting features work, this app is a horrible experience. The last time I saw this many ads was like 1998 GeoCities. The ads are everywhere. Ad Free Lite only removes some of the ads and cost as much as full real cell service near me. Ad Free Plus is required to remove all ads, but you still have a fake VOIP number that is difficult to use with some notification and 2FA code texts. The list of advertising partners for the account setup is the longest I have ever seen. If you don‚Äôt pay monthly, you must use your number daily or might lose it at any time. Avoid this company, they make users feel like trash and to get decent service you pay more than you would going to a local store and buying a nice prepaid plan. | Even after PAYING for the service, there are STILL a ton of advertisements on the app.  What‚Äôs the use in paying to have the ‚Äúadd free‚Äù subscription?  I will NOT be renewing my my PAID subscription.  I‚Äôll stick to the freebie. | So I paid almost 15$ but I need to pay WEEKLY FOR NO ADS AND TO LOCK IN MY NUMBER??? what did I pay for ?? | I enjoy using text now a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è | Hbbwj | üíï‚ù§Ô∏è | it was useful and good at first and I thought nothing of it until textnow would download files into my tablet whenever I used the app and I noticed that something called hacks was on there so I deleted it and went back on the app and it appeared again, then I opened my tablet and I saw an app that I never downloaded, it was named plots and it had some random image of an Asian man and I looked it up and it wasn‚Äôt an actual app on the App Store, I had to change all my passwords. | Hi the app is not opening at all today, it‚Äôs crashing every time I try - can someone look into it? üò≠ | Cannot get verification texts. Useless refund needed. | I‚Äôve been using this app for two years it‚Äôs fantastic.

Have no idea if I will have my tickets day of the venue. | I can‚Äôt print my tickets. I can‚Äôt get help by email or by phone. | My purchased seats still showing available | The app keeps telling me that I don‚Äôt have an internet connection but I do & all of my other apps are connecting just fine | Another day, another bogus ticket seller. When will this stop? | its bad enough i dont get a ticketstub to keep but now i cant even ‚Äòprint at home‚Äô. and then you dont offer a barcode in an email? YOURE MAKING ME DOWNLOAD AN APP I DO NOT WANT!!!! and TAKE my cell phone number?! AND THEN WHEN I OPEN THE TICKET THE SCREEN GOES FULL BRIGHTNESS & BURNS MY RETINAS WORSE THAN THE GUY IN RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. im not sure what im looking forward to more: the concert or uninstalling & blocking all this trash. | From start to finish having to buy tickets through AXS was a nightmare.  Takes literally hours to complete a transaction then are forced to download an App after your purchase to then only hope they eventually deposit your tickets? Customer service is NON Existent!  Cannot believe that any venue would subject people to this aggravating and stressful experience.  Still no tickets and the show is next week? Not able to contact anyone??? Don‚Äôt use this company - Period! | I bought concert tickets 2 weeks ago and have not received them in my mobile wallet yet. My credit card was charged for the transaction. I‚Äôve always have instant delivery concert tickets to my mobile wallet in the past. I later looked at my confirmation email and it read that they would be delivered the morning of the concert which is 6 months away. I don‚Äôt even feel confident  that I will receive my tickets in time for the show. This is unacceptable. | Monopolies like this should not exist | It‚Äôs mandatory for a lot of venues, so you‚Äôre stuck using it.  I would much rather print out a ticket then spend an hour downloading this horrible app, setting up the account, and then fighting it to get it to do what it is supposed to do. It shouldn‚Äôt take dozens of screens to buy a single freaking ticket. and the convenience fee is an insult for something that is so inconvenient. Garbage, garbage, garbage. | No ticket | This app requires sharing one's phone number. This is completely unnecessary and should be optional. There are also all kinds of cookie notifications and requests to track and requests to advertise. It's all ridiculous. I just want to buy a ticket to a concert. Charge a reasonable service fee and leave me alone until the next time I need a ticket. The ticket purchase process is almost enough to make me not want to go to a show. | Took me awhile to figure out how the system works.  I worked at getting them for several days. It works, just need patience! | took ten minutes for the app to show that the tickets were on sale just for them to already been sold out. did it yesterday for a presale and is doing it again today. every time i use axs it feels like im being punked | Just keep spinning | This app doesn‚Äôt work properly. | Can‚Äôt login using this app. This app is broken. I am able to perfectly login on the website using same credentials but when trying the app can‚Äôt freaking login. How else am I supposed to get the tickets???? I also have to blame the organizers for choosing the worst app ever my God! How frustrating! | What tickets, we‚Äôre supposedly downloaded and not on my app. NEVER AGAIN. 

Use stub hub. More reputable. | Nothing but issues with them.
Worse thing is that when I inquired about my name being misspelled they said I needed to send them multiple proof of identity to change my last name.  They wanted a copy of my driver's license, passport, or something similar.  For changing my name on a ticketing app!  I spent the last 20 years working for another companies app and we did everything possible to get our customers information correct.  We never asked for anything that private.

And then had tons of issues and long waits  getting refunded when Aaron Lewis cancelled his concert.

Very poor company and a shame that key west amphitheater uses them.  It keeps me from going to events cause I don't trust this ticketing company. | Where are my tickets? | This whole company is trash | Posted tickets for sale, a day before the event I received an email confirming they were sold.  Never received the money.  Contacted the help desk and they said it is just a bug and the tickets were never sold.  Feels like the tickets were sold and they just kept the money. | I really like the Axs app but when they try charging $75 per ticket for a convenience fee, I‚Äôm out. It‚Äôs time for buyers to stop letting them do that to us. | App never loads not compatible with older phones | Last two concerts I tried to purchase using the app and payment failed. Same payment worked fine on the AXS website. Something is wrong with this app. I won‚Äôt be using it anymore since it keeps wasting my time. | I‚Äôm trying to order tickets and nothing is working | Did not refund my resale tickets :( | Frustrating rating: 10 stars! I set up an account but before I could even log in the app gave me a ‚Äúsomething has gone wrong‚Äù msg. This has happened for many days at all times of the day. If a real human is reading this please advise. Must log in by Sat 9am. | That‚Äôs the only message I‚Äôve been getting for the last 3 months when I launch the app on my phone.  Super frustrating AND stressful.  What‚Äôs going to happen when I show up a the concert this Friday at the Rams Head Tavern jn Annapolis?? | Customer service is non existent at best. Worst company I have ever bought tickets from, and worst UI/app I have ever seen | I can‚Äôt buy a ticket on the app anymore, because the button to proceed is hidden under the seating chart, and I can‚Äôt scroll and click at the same time. Yall are probably losing $$ on this issue lol | If you‚Äôre going to force me to download your terrible app just so I can go to a concert, please just save my password or let me transfer the tickets to apple wallet. I‚Äôm so tired of resetting my password while half drunk in line for an event. Please for the love of god find some way to provide an actual service as a company instead of just being a useless leech on society draining the last remaining fun out of live events. | I have given up on some shows because of the horrible performance of this app/site. Multiple attempts to purchase only for it to freeze up or reject payment for no reason. Took me an hour to buy Stones tickets. I don‚Äôt know how AXS stays in business other than being a monopoly for a lot of events. | My wife sends me tickets and it always have problems getting them | Love the ease of buying and receiving tickets with this app. Easy entry to venue. | I bought 3 tickets 2 months ago for a event at april 26, I got an email but never got a bar code at axs app. I just hope that I can still go to the event with the proof that I have but I don‚Äôt have a barcode that the staff would want to enter the concert | Day of the show and still don‚Äôt have tix from seat geek. Why is this app necessary? Called help line and got nowhere. | I purchased tickets to an event that included private lounge access during the entire event. It then got changed to only having private lounge access for half of the event. AXS never sent out a notice about the change and just added a caveat on the ticker that the lounge access wouldn‚Äôt be until later in the event. When I emailed AXS, they assured me they would move me to another section with the full lounge access. When I called the number provided to transfer my tickets, I was told that they couldn‚Äôt guarantee our seats would be equal or greater value than the tickets we have (which was promised in the email) and that we wouldn‚Äôt know the seats until AFTER the transfer occurred, so we couldn‚Äôt decide if we wanted to proceed with the transfer. | Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets Impossible to get tickets | Can ever get into it tried to buy tickets, but it said something went wrong. Nothing but a hassle. | Thought I was paying for tickets to be sent to my account when it was actually for a shuttle. I do not want a shuttle ticket and still don‚Äôt see my barcode for 6 Rolling Stone tickets. Please credit my account for $29 paid for a shuttle I do not want or need and send barcode for Stones
 tickets! | I‚Äôm calling the better business bureau. This platform is horrible. They only let robots buy tickets and then make you prove 17+ times you‚Äôre not a robot. I then got reported as a robot and was unable to buy tickets. After I was told tickets were sold out, not being even allowed access to buy tickets AND then given the only option to buy tickets at an unreasonable price. $1600 to be exact when the tickets were $75/piece. Couldn‚Äôt even use my presale code because it kept telling me it was invalid. This happened to everyone I know as well. Then, it finally lets you maybe have a chance for tickets IF you want to pay over $300 in fees per ticket, and over $1000 for a single ticket that is supposed to be $75. I‚Äôm so sick of this nonsense. It‚Äôs unacceptable. AXS clearly doesn‚Äôt care about users and only wants to make money then rob people when they have the audacity to want to see a favorite artist. An absolute scam of a website, app and company. I‚Äôm still unable to buy tickets, that are probably 12x the actual price, because I was labeled a ‚Äúrobot‚Äù. It‚Äôs truly unbelievable that people are no longer able to buy tickets to see their favorite artists without being bought out and robbed in an already horrific economy. Unethical. Unacceptable. Unbelievable. Disgraceful. | Most unfriendly app I‚Äôve used! Brutal! | I bought tickets through Axs for a show in Las Vegas that was canceled; Axs will not refund my money. I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôll never use them again. A $300 lesson learned the hard way. | I bought tickets- they showed up on my app; and now they‚Äôre gone.  No explanation | No me han resuelto mi problema de mis tickets | Sold ticket on her here 3 weeks ago & still haven‚Äôt gotten paid ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ | Freezing. Hard to get seats, payment options are horrible. Only reason i still use is cause the pricing is the best. Overall this app can be soo bad that I sometimes pay a few bucks more just to use a app that actually works. | I have a show for today and cannot reset password | Some events aren‚Äôt listed when searching, you sometimes have to purchase your tickets using a third party, and then it‚Äôll prompt in your ticket section.

Yesterday I tried for 20 minutes to start the app. Time to try again guys. | Very user unfriendly. Overly complicated. And won‚Äôt accept credentials, even after they were updated. | Costco always has something I like. | I enjoy how easy it is to find the category I‚Äôm looking for and the details about the various items. I do pay attention to the reviews, Costco shoppers know quality and are honest about their experiences. Costco pricing and service is second to none. | Why can‚Äôt the Costco app be as good as the store? I don‚Äôt want to be immediately shifted into 2-day buying, or have to try to figure out where the current warehouse deals are (since the actual ones don‚Äôt seem to be the same as the printed ones, either).

After a Points Guy IG post, suggesting checking out Costco Travel for deals, I tried. Twice. 1) Couldn‚Äôt find a specifically designated ‚ÄúTravel‚Äù section, only ‚Äúcheck out these deals‚Äù and 2) when I hit the ‚Äúcheck out these deals,‚Äù all I got was a spinning wheel.

This app should be taken off platforms until it is usable. Fix the UI to be *shopper* intuitive, not corporation intutitive. | With how much a membership costs, you‚Äôd think more time and money would go into developing this app. The UI is so clunky and confusing. You‚Äôre either looking at warehouse items or clicking random buttons to get to the grocery part which sometimes works and other times it‚Äôs not available. I‚Äôm not sure how to find the things most important to me like getting a package of chicken thighs and not the ones that contain enough to feed an army. It‚Äôs so confusing and unnecessary. It doesn‚Äôt save time at all. It just angers me. From the app alone, I think I might cancel my membership. | Hii Costco! Please include more beauty conscious korean skincare and  luxury shampoo/conditioner like ORIBE alchemy hair shampoo/conditioner. I couldn‚Äôt find it when searching to refill my supplies. Thank you so much! | Tiene todo lo que necesito | Wonderful and fun to use | As biased as I may be, this place gives me hope for a better world, as it should be, filled with unconditional kindness, compassion and quality everything. Thank you for existing. | I love how you can click on the what‚Äôs new link, and the everyday savings link | App doesn‚Äôt show all items in warehouse in different categories like other wholesale clubs | Just get Sams club membership and learn from them on how to make shopping experience easier. | I hate how this app turns up my screen brightness all the way on the account screen. It‚Äôs not even for scanning - I just wanted to see membership info. | Can you guys add a bar code as well on the app? So we can use the app also in other countries.
Right now its impossible to use it in Mexico because they have the system on Bar Code reader, and US app uses QR code. Thanks | Your app is not user friendly to see if you have items in stock or price check., | I would like to be able to order grocery products on standard shipping rather than having to use the two day delivery. | The app has always been a clunky experience that seems to be 5-10 years behind other modern apps. The latest update inexplicably removed the ability to share/copy a link to a product, now you can only share to social media. Whoever is in charge of this app development needs to be fired. | My husband and I enjoy going to costco since we can find things easily with affordable price. | Useless.  App doesn‚Äôt even open. | The app developers need to update the app. If it‚Äôs asking for a zip code - have the numerical value populate not the entire keyboard. The verify your account never works. Thought this would be a good subscription to have but the app leaves everything to be desired. | Need to be cognizant of the tabs across the top, and the fact that they show out of stock items as a default.  Can be tricky to navigate, so the interface takes some getting used to.  Ultimately gets the job done though! | The app more often than not fails to launch after the first time. If it does manage to successfully launch, it sometimes crashes or causes the phone to overheat. This started after the major update a few months ago. I can‚Äôt even use the app to show my digital membership card which is all I ever really used it for. They need to fix this app or support Apple Wallet for their membership. This has been going on for months. | I have found the app easy to navigate and the information is very helpful. | Costco next can‚Äôt check out. | To be sent an email or phone call of GOLD COINS being available for purchase. | Very easy to navigate, makes shopping for home supplies more convenient | Costco forces you to update their app before using. Once you do this, there‚Äôs now a digital membership card that can only be used in one device! Most of us go between two or more devices, like a phone and tablet. Now the customer must choose, with no warning and no work-around. This is one of the most digital user unfriendly stores. Makes me rethink my membership. | Can‚Äôt order what I see in store. | Very annoying app. 
App keeps loading stuff from the web. Why can‚Äôt the monthly deals be seen more easily? You have to scroll around now looking. 

Why can you add to your list from the deals? Shopping in the app is frustrating. | Love everything about Costco from the clothes to the food to the service. You never can go wrong with Costco. | Not enough results related to search.  For example, shrubs returned one result which did not include boxwoods.   However a search for boxwood came up with the correct result.   Makes it hard to consider other alternatives. | I love Costco but their app is probably the worst shopping app I have every used. The only thing it is useful for is your digital membership card. | Most unusable app. No in store inventory. | Every time I order something through Costco online, the product is delivered in a timely manner, and great quality. | I would give Costco five stars except for their packaging. Most of it is impossible to recycle, and is often excessively excessive! as a corporation, I wish they would do more to go zero, or very low, waste. I find I am shopping less and less at Costco because of the packaging. Also, do I really need so many avocados? | 1.  Can not select more than 1 filter item at a time. Once touched, the filter closes and must be reopened to enter another filter item. Good apps allow selecting multiple features, then applies with a confirmation button. 

2. Why can‚Äôt I see what is available to buy in store. It appears that way but when entered into the shopping cart shows it as needed to be delivered to the store for pickup. 

There‚Äôs more but Im too frustrated to keep writing. | I mean it‚Äôs Costco.  
It‚Äôs Awesome, and I don‚Äôt even eat the samples. 
Or return things.  

Food court should host weddings as far as I‚Äôm concerned. üë∞üë∞.  Love the joint. | It took a major part of my day but my order was finally accepted. | Quick and easy. | Easy to use! | With this version when I tap share it only allows me to share to Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter. 
It should be like the iOS native share sheet that allows AirDrop, Messages, and copying. 
Please fix. | Works well enough but there are glitches often where I have to reload the page. | Better | The online order works fine | I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd say it, but Sam‚Äôs has a better app. Costco needs to bring a similar feature like Scan & Go with Sam‚Äôs. I‚Äôm starting to shop less at Costco because of how long the lines get. Someone is going to get hurt one day, and all of it can be prevented by allowing for faster checkout. 
The app as it stands now is just a basic one. It‚Äôs basically a web page with touch interface. | Would be nice if it had Sam‚Äôs Club ability to scan and go right on your phone to pay and check out so that all you need to do at the door is show electronic receipt otherwise not very helpful just ok. | Search feature no longer works. It just reloads the home screen. Products do exist but you have to hunt them down in their category. I‚Äôll pay more and just order on Amazon. | The app doesn‚Äôt let me add my membership or my last name to be able to confirm it. It freezes and it doesn‚Äôt let me do anything! | We travel a lot & preferred to see the warehouses pop up on the menu so we can tell which one is the closest in the direction we‚Äôre going. Now we just get a list at startup & it wants you to set your home store! I don‚Äôt want to change my home store while I‚Äôm traveling.

Obviously a bug in their algorithm design. | I met Jan De Jong on your site in early march. He was NOT verified, however I did manage to get him to FaceTime me but it was for only a short viewing.

We developed a relationship over 6 weeks. I could have married this man. He pressured me to open an app called DeFi wallet and buy etherium/bitcoin.

I ended up putting $10k in and he took it all.  Contacted the FBI, the FTC, the app, and my bank and the funds can‚Äôt be retrieved.

I think everyone should have to be photo verified going forward to use your site and better safety measures should be taken. | What did you do to this app‚Ä¶messages say failed to send, then I send another, that doesn‚Äôt show up for like 5 minutes.

Mozilla.org who makes the Firefox browser has been auditing companies for privacy for some time now and Tinder is rated as ‚Äúprivacy not included‚Äù in 2020- 70,000 photos of women shared on Tinder ended up on the open web. They sell all of your information and they and other dating companies use your conversations with others to train their systems, while I don‚Äôt think they sell the direct conversations they do sell the information they get from those conversations. I use Tinder and I‚Äôm now very frustrated that I have. Going forward if you insist on using Tinder please be very cautious. I know it feels useless to worry since they all have it but it‚Äôs not only about your specific data it‚Äôs about the idea that they can use your information as a product after subjecting you to ads and already using their serves in an understood exchange- either being that you watch ads or you pay for premium. However premium features are not a fixed price, they charge you more based on your demographics. If you‚Äôre male you get charged more, if you‚Äôre older you get charged more. So they have zero issue taking as much as you can give and then sell your information anyways. I‚Äôd recommend if you insist on using tinder going forward you should attempt to limit what you share with them, limit the services you connect. | Tinder is past it‚Äôs usefulness.

Sorting through you matches also needs improvement. I have suggestions for better user experience. The pool could be easier to navigate with few key changes to individual preferences with personality, lifestyle and desires to be matched with during search. | This app suddenly became really buggy. Makes it difficult to use. | I made an account for me and my ex and haven‚Äôt been able to delete it since to make my own account so that sucksüíÄ | I've only been using tinder recently this week and I get on it today bc I said why not let's take a leap of faith. So it asks me if I'm human 5 times!!! Then I reload the app 10 minutes later and it my account was suspicious and under review??? I've only used it twice! L app and L developers/Creator. | I bought their Gold Subscription for a week because I just moved to a new city and wanted to meet new people, and had absolutely zero likes for nearly the whole week until it finally expired. As soon as it expired, I get all these likes the exact same day, which I can‚Äôt see until I renew the subscription. If you‚Äôre considering Tinder, just don‚Äôt -save your money. You have better odds on any other dating app if you must use one. Tinders staff has clearly been very methodical on how to attempt to get you to pay more for less. Luckily for me I have enough game to hit the bars and do just fine for a fraction of the cost. This app is absolutely worthless, and worst yet it‚Äôs full of fake profiles and scammers. They want men with no game to fork over all their money. If you don‚Äôt have game, get game. Work on your presentation, dress well, hit the gym, be confident in yourself to talk to women. If you have time to arrange a date with a match on Tinder then you have time to hit up a bar, event, any social setting etc and make friends that way -it‚Äôs far easier, more impactful, time saving, cost friendly and life changing. You‚Äôd think a digital service like Tinder would provide all of that, but that is dead wrong. It‚Äôs harder, less impactful, waste a ton of time, expensive and makes you feel worse about yourself. TRASH! | Tinder uses the same misleading fraudulent practices than it‚Äôs sister Apps OkCupid, Hinge or any of the Match.com brands. Do not be fooled in purchasing an overpriced subscription. Seriously 3/4 of your ‚Äúlikes‚Äù will be coming from 6K miles away or by in-app fake profiles misleading you into purchase. App also shows you profiles way out of your set parameters including sexual orientation which can be very dangerous. Just another scammy fraudulent money $$$ grab. | On a work trip in a college town and the app shows me 10 girls total and says there‚Äôs no one else. It truly is just a cash grab for the developers trying to charge $18 a week for premium. | Way better then lame POF | it used to be much easier to meet people on the recently it‚Äôs become more of a pay to play situation and I‚Äôve noticed inconsistencies with the over time I‚Äôll go through periods of having constant matches to periods of have little to little to none randomly and back and forth mind you using same photos ect, also I‚Äôve had 2 photos taken down with nothing bad but then I see nude bots pop up advertising OF and never see them get taken down. Miss the early days of this app for sure in a similar fashion to Snapchat every update just makes me dislike the app more and more unfortunately. | I've should‚Äôve known better to get this app in the first place, this app is filled with nothing but fake girls, they'll swipe right on you but never message you or when you message them they never respond back, so why bother trying to get a girlfriend on here, when I can just and find that special girl out in public somewhere, so I'm done with this app, it‚Äôs not working out for me, I‚Äôm just gonna find that special someone in my life my own way by looking out there, the old fashioned way. And I‚Äôm not even gonna bother getting this app or any other dating app for that matter because dating apps like this one and Bumble are nothing but a waste of time so I‚Äôm not gonna bother with those apps or any other dating apps, I‚Äôm done with Tinder, I‚Äôm done with dating apps period, forget about it! | Not a good app at all. Everyone gets banned for no reason, bumble is the only good app I found that has smart enough devs to make solutions that stop you from ‚Äúviolating‚Äù there ‚Äúterms‚Äù automatically. Instead of being banned from ai, or matches that report you for not talking back to them? Lol | This app does not vet its users it‚Äôs filled with scams and fake profiles. | It‚Äôs the worst app I have ever used | Tinder is now just a cash grab glorified casino were the gambling chips are your free time and the house advantage is the website is just scammers | What‚Äôs the point of the distance and age being set with parameters that you choose if the app disregards them anyway? 
Same for the type of profiles you see, why display women for women looking to meet men or men for men when they‚Äôre looking to meet women? | This app just wants our money, doesn‚Äôt care if we find love. | I met the mother of my children on this app, when things unfortunately didn‚Äôt work out I met my recent girlfriend whom I dated for over a year. While her and I looked for friend both our accounts received bans, I talked to a friend who said you could appeal the ban which I did which IT TOOK 6 MONTHS BEFORE I HEARD BACK and the ban was reversed. WITHIN 10 MINS and 2 swipes of my ban being reversed, I was banned again. The appeal team said the content that was deemed inappropriate was removed HOWEVER I had to reappeal the ban because I hadn‚Äôt even been able to look at my profile to remove whatever content they viewed as a violation. AFTER TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY EMAIL OR TALK TO, I REALIZED THEIR APPEALS TEAM HAS NO WAY OF LEAVING COMMENTS OR SPEAKING TO SOMEONE TO PLEAD MY CASE. I‚ÄôM FURIOUS! AFTER PAYING FOR VARIOUS MEMBERSHIPS AND PREMIUM UPGRADES AND BOOSTS, I WAS GIVEN A FINAL BAN THAT WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO RETURN TO THE APP OR CREATE NEW ACCOUNTS. IF and ONLY IF my ban is reversed would I ever consider telling anyone to use YOUR APP. I AM NOW A DETRACTOR AND TELL PEOPLE TO AVOID USING TINDER BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF CARE FOR LONG TIME USERS OF THE APP. | Too expensive to upgrade and such a gamble that it would work when there's a chance no one will match you still. If you feel lucky go right ahead. | Keeps say error message failed to send or failed to match on the likes I got | Will take your money and then ban you for no reason won‚Äôt even tell you why, screw this app just use hinge instead save yourself the trouble | Unfortunately the truth. | I‚Äôve been using this app for years, why you may ask? 1 in every 3 accounts I match with are fake.  Women trying to get you to spend money for explicit photos, videos, or getting you to subscribe to their OF. I turned to this app because I don‚Äôt like to approach people in real life due to finding it disrespectful or overstepping boundaries since you don‚Äôt know a person or their situation. Yet I‚Äôm constantly flooded with women‚Äôs accounts only here for their own benefits. 5 years on this app and haven‚Äôt found anyone anywhere close to right for me. Don‚Äôt bother spending your money on this, or even installing it. Majority of it is exploiting men‚Äôs emotions due to loneliness from my perspective and majority of what my male friends have experienced as well. If you happen to install and find someone, then good for you, but don‚Äôt get your hopes up fellas. | You can tell they are just money hungry and want to keep you on the app. Most accounts are fake or haven‚Äôt been active in MONTHS. You get a whole lot of matches at first and then after you don‚Äôt get nothing. Like they want you to buy boosts or buy the premium. Go to a bar and find a nice girl because tinder wants to keep you single for $$$ | They Try to charge you to see who likes you lol. | Trying to Charge someone $100 a month or more just to have your name mentioned more is criminal. | The ratio between men and woman is extremely huge on this app. There‚Äôs statistics out there that says 80/20 where it‚Äôs mostly man. 

This obviously really hurts the dating scene/market for males. 

Female have boosted ego where they just ignore most of the man. Nobody is serious here. Girls are rude and superficial. 

Go try Coffee Meets Bagel where it‚Äôs more serious. | If you‚Äôre a guy, you‚Äôre going to spend money just to maybe, have one conversation. Total scam of an app now holy moly it‚Äôs a joke.. | Nothing in the app is worth paying for bought got a few matches but most are not accounts or the same 3 people. Even got more swipes after I cancelled my subscription but guess what gott pay $20-40. At this point dating apps are just useless money grabs | they wont let me make an account cause im apparently not of age even though im 18 and i‚Äôve showed them my passport. please fix this. | All of a sudden I find out tinder added the rule where you only have 24 hours to respond when you match with someone and I HATE IT. i liked tinder for NOT having it. some days i don‚Äôt check tinder or even i need time to think of what to say and then i miss it? matched with a guy YESTERDAY and i was an hour too late to respond. it‚Äôs lost me so many matches and has become incredibly infuriating. | If you don't pay you would never match with someone. And they just want your money.it not worth it. | Bans account for no reason | I pay money for this app out of necessity and I am CONSTANTLY being locked out of it by the app with no reason given. In the past three days I have reverified and sent pictures in twice, all while being locked out and unable to use it. Support has NEVER gotten back to me with a resolution for this, so it forces me to cancel my subscription and warn everyone I know not to bother with this. Hinge and Bumble literally never do this. | And if you‚Äôre willing to pay, then go off. But otherwise your profile will be hidden from people after the first couple of weeks, you‚Äôll be shown the same people over and over, and even paying for Boosts won‚Äôt do anything for you. Shoutout to Hinge and OkCupid for being immensely superior experiences. | My account was banned for no reason at all..I got on the app one day and saw my account was terminated with no response on why. I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and when I emailed support no help from them‚Ä¶",4.06125,1017054,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/87/2f/5f/872f5f12-505c-12b1-9630-11818095eccf/71e55929-d183-4755-94df-2cfa4d2967ee_Dark_Mode_iOS_5.5_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/8c/ef/71/8cef714e-2478-9c3d-eef9-83f9b7f51edf/c19ffc34-067a-4f5d-8033-8de591e97f46_Dark_Mode_iOS_5.5_02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/58/dd/72/58dd7243-9482-8526-f80e-51fac9bab4a2/f53b1922-3b20-4d7b-ade6-b7c6a86b3c61_Dark_Mode_iOS_5.5_03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2c/98/f5/2c98f561-4c8e-5fbd-38b6-489619f8e7d2/21f7a27f-815c-4bd7-abde-2db7d1601efb_Dark_Mode_iOS_5.5_04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e8/59/b5/e859b5ca-f212-76d5-e614-8f842c15dfed/a6d59920-fce3-4d16-a0fd-7ebcd8c1a252_Dark_Mode_iOS_5.5_05.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/15/7e/aa/157eaa33-f754-e751-a6c4-cefb06c5b540/1a9a5bc6-1c1e-422e-967d-14fe7994129d_Dark_Mode_iOS_5.5_06.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/35/74/4e/35744e40-3db0-f98c-5f47-7d2aaf085fe6/8ad07a12-efa4-4b6f-8caa-9293db16c0ab_Dark_Mode_iOS_5.5_07.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/8e/9e/06/8e9e064d-134f-42d7-08b2-a8e4304a7e79/8c878314-3df0-47ef-afb9-58a93dfb5f0b_Dark_Mode_iOS_5.5_08.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I couldn't let go because I invested my savings as at that time. I had to make a research on how I could recover my funds from them and I came across the Cyber spy GENIUS Team on this app after so many research. I read several good reviews about this app from various scam victims they have helped and I decided to contact the admin for help.

Cryptorecovery360@ Gmail | Destroyed what was Mint. Support is non-existent. Security is lax with your financial accounts. Safe to delete. | Takes to long to reflect when you pay off balance | Not the true reading | Always great to be able to check your score for any changes which may also not have been made by you. And does not affect your credit score! Also, gives solid advice on how to keep your score in good standing & which credit cards will benefit the user. Very good credit add! | Your information is being sold badly to the wrong people | Please bring back the Mint UI. It was just way better with Mint. I understand there was an acquisition but the UI is just way worse than what they had | Pretty useless since the change over from Mint to Credit Karma. They have removed so many of the useful features, accounts don‚Äôt stay synced, account balances are incorrect even after syncing, and the budgeting tools that were so great are no longer available. It‚Äôs basically an app to sell you credit cards and financial services. üëéüèæ | Already have account but had to create a password on iPad. Always use pin on phone and when this app asked about signing in another way, it wouldn‚Äôt let me. You need to fix this issue | The recent buy out of Mint from Intuit by Credit Karma has been a real game changer for me. Credit Karma lacks all of Mints impotrtant features providing insight to current financial status allowing for timely decisions. I fail to see any utility in Credit Karma. | Data is not reliable, the app only exists to sell you credit offers | Mint was so much better. This app is awful. Accounts don‚Äôt stay linked. It duplicates accounts if a new link is established. It never updates. Sometimes for over two weeks accounts won‚Äôt update. Done with it! | Intuit shut down the Mint app and forced us to move over to Credit Karma. Loved mint for its budget and expense tracking. That‚Äôs not what Credit Karma is. I don‚Äôt need an app to tell me what credit cards I‚Äôm approved for. | Roughly about five years ago, encountered financial difficulties and maintaining my credit.
I saw a app that one of my friends told me about called Credit Karma. He explained to me by using this app you can manage your credit in my credit has been excelling every month implementing this powerful app thank you Credit Karma for helping to get me back on the right track.
Also the the Credit Karma app helps you in investing and filing taxes | This is a vessel for ads. It‚Äôs not a tool for money management. All of the good reviews are from when it was Mint. Deleted this garbage immediately. | They have me build my credit back up. | I loveCredit Karma, they are the best and you need to get your spending aAccount | If you have different or multiple checking and savings accounts, All of the transactions from these accounts are all combined together in one list. You cannot see the transactions of only one account without having the other accounts mixed in. Therefore it is very difficult to comprehend what transaction was with what account. therefore, I am searching for a more appropriate app for my needs.
If you have multiple credit cards, the transactions are individualized to each card. The way it should be. | You guys are awesome ü•∞ | Una aplicaci√≥n muy √∫til para saber el estado de nuestros cr√©ditos | Credikarma he‚Äôll mi to improve may experience | I love Credit Karma. I love all the options and everything you are able to C, and do your credit score and financial situation. I also love the fact they do not constantly harass me for a review on their app, which is why I came to write one myself 5 Stars Way to go Credit Karma. | I used to have Mint to help me budget and track all my finances. I‚Äôm beyond dissapointed that I lost the features I used to help me track my money when Credit Karma took over. It‚Äôs just about sales, trying to sell me a loan, or credit card or anything else. I want the budget and spending trends back. I‚Äôm on the hunt for a new app to use. | Makes it nice seeing what is happening with my credit keeps me alert having hard times but I‚Äôll bounce back | Good service | They destroyed my favorite app, Mint that I‚Äôve been using for the last 15 years with the false promise of transitioning Mints best features. Pure false promises. I‚Äôve Abandoned credit carma and am currently evaluating Monarch and Quickin Simplifi to see which one I want to permanently switch to. I despise Intuit so much right now that I even switched from Turbo Tax to H&R Block. | I like the fact that I can see my financial information in one place.  But the user interface (both Mobile and web) is too cluttered with ‚Äúoffers‚Äù I have no interest in. | Awesome App with your credit as its best interest. | Credit Karma is a sub-par replacement for Intuit‚Äôs former product Mint. It lacks desirable features Mint provided. Credit Karma customer service has been poor as well. I have an error message I‚Äôve been trying to resolve and all communications to date make it obvious their technical person is not reading (or not comprehending) what i wrote to them, and are simply following a trouble shooting script that doesn‚Äôt work. | Delete | Poor account updating cooperation. | Signed up for this new feature on Credit Karma while doing my taxes on turbo tax. Have been attempting to link my navy fed account since February. Every single attempt ends with ‚ÄúOops there‚Äôs an error on our side, please try again‚Äù. The account shows up as linked on Navy Feds side so after talking to them, I contacted Credit Karma support. I‚Äôve been going in circles with them for over a month and have been instructed to do everything from get a new phone (I have the iPhone 15 so it‚Äôs not that) to them instructing me to open a new bank account ü§Ø At this point I needed my money and just paid the fees to directly send it to my card but that adds up to almost 100$ in fees. If they are doing this to multiple people they are making a killing off scamming their customers. Highly disappointed and will not use them when doing taxes or anything in the future.

*Response to developer response: I‚Äôve done all of the above. It was members of Credit Karma support who instructed me to sign into my account on a different phone, open a new account bc it MUST be my bank, try buying a new phone ect. You guys did everything but fix the problem or refund my money. AGAIN. Will never use your products or services again. | I used mint.com for years and years and this is nothing like it. I went to mint every day. This I barely go too because it‚Äôs horrible!! Not useful at all. | Way to many Ad and Promotion. It‚Äôs ruins the app experience | Love how easy it is to use and see everything in one place. | This is the best tool if you are looking to fix your credit . I have increase my score by more than 150points because I'm keeping an eye on it. The app helps with that a lot by notifications and simulations. I used another apps that wanted $12 a month. This is just as effective. ITS FREEEEEEEE. Thanks credit karma.

*update
This app is trash no. When it merged with mint it lost off the functionality that mint provided . Horrible decision. | My credit score has not been updated for5 months, what is the problem | Not always a second updated but I can catch things I need to pay and help improve my score. | Always giving suggestions and most of all‚Ä¶support.
I like this APP! | This app is terrible. Spam you to death. Track everything you do. Need your social security number to sign up!! What a joke! Stay far away from this app. It doesn‚Äôt do what Mint used to do. Huge downgrade. Who in their right mind came up with this needs a new job. I‚Äôd pay to have Mint. Not monthly, but I would purchase the app outright. This app is a shame and a sham unless you have credit problems, maybe it can help?

Haven't used this remote in months and my cards usually locked and next thing i know i have a $40 charge on it for a yearly remote i don't even have downloaded on my phone and haven't for months. LAME!  I don't even have a TV, i used this MONTHS ago when i was in an Air bnB. Almost 3 months ago!! | Has a high rating for it not working constantly, it connects to my tv but will stop functioning with in just a few moments or clicks. And has crashed on me. | Making us pay complete bssss | I‚Äôm writing this review after least 12 different attempts to connect to my smart TV. I‚Äôve tried everything, unplugged TV and waited for 2-3 min (12x), rebooted modem, rebooted phone, checked phone settings, re-installed app, etc. . .and I still cannot connect.

In my experience, this is not even worth a free subscription much less paying. | I pressed the buttons 3 times and then it locked it so that I would have to pay for a subscription. Absolutely insane. Subscriptions have become over the top. It‚Äôs a goddamn remote. Why do I need to pay $4.99 a week to be able to press some buttons? | Trash .You guys have the customer service, 0/10 | So what happened Was they charge me $40 right away instead of giving me the three day free trial after I tried to get a refund I couldn‚Äôt get one even after I canceled the subscription before the three days like literally the first day I got it, but I never got my money back. I still regret getting this app. Apple says my refund was refunded and i never got my money back. | Muy mala | I connected my remote to the tv last night it was fine but this more it won‚Äôt respond to any buttons I press pause stop play etc idk how to fix I have already disconnected and reconnected I have already deleted and reinstall the arrows and okay buttons are purple and I do t think they should be they were not when it was working last night can someone help | I‚Äôm sorry but the fact that you have to pay to use the app is insane,annoying, and a waste of money! | What is the purpose of paying for this app if it takes forever to connect!!! | This service is very expensive for what it‚Äôs offering and useless without buying the premium | I paid $29.99 ‚ÄúLIFETIME‚Äù Then, couple days later, $39.99 was drafted from my account for annual subscription. The remote works well. Customer Service responded promptly and Apple issued a refund for the annual charge, thank you | Literally stopped working. Kept promoting to buy more buy more. Deleted it and used another app. Pretty annoying | I downloaded this app then deleted it after it served no purpose to me I then canceled my subscription, few days later I tried downloading another app and it said the I need to up my card information because I was still being charged for this remote app even after I canceled and deleted the app I can no longer download anything and my card is still getting charged | Would you rather buy a normal remote or a remote that charges you money every week and month of course you could are picking the normal one. Meanwhile this app is charging you way too much for a simple function so just get a normal remote | Can‚Äôt use a sine button unless u pay for premium and at that point just buy a new remote from Amazon, name literally says free remote control app | Charged me $40 for a free 3 day trial I cancelled within 24 hours. I disputed it on Paypal and they sided with Apple. | I paid for lifetime warranty and I just tried to turn my tv off and said I had to pay so why did I just waste my money if the app resets and says I have to pay either they know what they‚Äôre doing or they need to fix that feature cause that‚Äôs just ridiculous. | Good but you have to pay monthly | It‚Äôs wonderful 5 stars. | So ez to use thank you | Horrifying app. I subscribed to their monthly thing and they sold my credit card number and i had to file a police report | The app buttons will not respond most of the time | Tapped on free trial, and it pulled $42.89 from my bank card‚Ä¶ did not want to pay for this without trying first. Trying to find a place to see about a refund is going no where‚Ä¶ | Why do I have to payüíÄüíÄ | Idoesnt work I want my money back | Volume and Home button work. Nothing else. | I like the idea but I don‚Äôt like how if u click the ring thing pay for pass | Sssuuucckkkssz | Trash app, do not buy unless you want to pay 5 dollars a month or 25 dollars just to use the app now. I only use it when I can‚Äôt find my remote and I used to deal with the ads every three to four clicks but NOW? Now you can‚Äôt do anything without it forcing you to do a three day free trial. So stupid. will not be using the app ever again. Deleting immediately. | Pls do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt get this app! It said a free trial and ended but charging me 43 dollars the same day. I reached out to them and they didn‚Äôt even respond. I cancelled the membership 10 minutes after I saw that they charged me and till this day they haven‚Äôt refunded me. It also ended but that it didn‚Äôt even work for the TV so I spent 43$ on service that didn‚Äôt even work. I would love for them to reach out to me  to resolve this issue! | Cool | Not working | Can‚Äôt turn on and off without signing up | CAN YOU NOT MAKE ME PAY AFTER 5 CLICKS? | The app worked fine for a couple of months and now I cannot use even the free version any button I click the premium page will pop up . | Joyner | Need physical remote to connect to tv. | Constantly ask for subscription it‚Äôs a waste of time don‚Äôt download | I have to constantly ‚Äòaccept‚Äô control of my TV. With a newborn, part of the appeal of this was just using my phone‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs annoying I need to find the remote to ‚Äòaccept‚Äô control. Wish it could remember the device indefinitely. Once connected, it‚Äôs fine | I want to unsubscribe and don‚Äôt see the option. Please give me steps on how to do so. If it can be done without me please unsubscribe! Thank you!!! | Only worked for five minutes and then tried to force me to buy a lifetime subscription for $30 | The app worked for about a week. I didn‚Äôt waste time with the free trial and jumped straight to the lifetime option. It no longer connects to my tv and I‚Äôve done everything I can to get it to work, and I mean everything (for reference I troubleshoot electronics for a living). I sent my complaint to the support email already and nothing has been done nor have I gotten a reply. Just don‚Äôt get this app. 5 anti-star rating from me. | Why do you have to pay to turn up the volume my tv doesn‚Äôt even have a volume button and I lost my remote Samsung so

Great evening. Visit Pink Taco.  Great experience. Cheers. | I‚Äôve been coming here for sometime now and each time Nick has done such an amazing job with my lashes. He‚Äôs knows exactly what to do! Love it! | Very happy. üòÉ | Best little coffee shop I have ever had. I love the atmosphere and the people that work there not to mention the coffee is fantastic. This is going to be my regular spot. I highly recommend it!üëçüèªüòÅ | I write a review explaining a company will cancel on appointments and not reschedule for you but if you do then they charge you.  Explained that the company bailed on my appointment the day of and didn‚Äôt do anything to fix the situation other than tell me to get over.  The company replied confirming this to be fact but rants on about family issues and takes a jab at me on a social high horse absolutely validating that nothing in my review was dishonest at all.  It‚Äôs the only review and you guys magically don‚Äôt recommend it‚Ä¶.  What is the point of this app if I can‚Äôt tell others great places to use and warn them of horrible ones? | Angelo recently installed new equipment to my home. He was great very patient with some unforeseen problems. If you want an honest plumber with good prices Angelo is your man, | You lost your credibility, with me, and so many other people.. WHERE DO I START I got an offer to make a yelp business page after buying something from another site. I get it set up, great, I got an offer for 300$ credit for ads, sure great. There was a call to action on Yelp‚Äôs website that I should start sharing my profile. Logical, yes, so I share my Yelp on posts, I added Yelp to by business landing page. I shared it to my stories on social media, started telling people ‚Äúoh I made a Yelp, if you want to see a portfolio of my work‚Äù. People started filtering there. I get in a few days later, and start noticing that my reviews were being deleted. They 1) asked me to share help to get people on help 2) got people to make a Yelp account 3) deleted my honest reviews from return clients. I asked their team, ‚Äúwhy are you asking me to share your site if you‚Äôre just going to delete my reviews?‚Äù They responded that they have an ‚Äúautomated system‚Äù that detects solicited reviews. I‚Äôm not soliciting reviews, I‚Äôm sharing my page which I was proud of because I put a lot of time into my work. Gross. This is a terrible way to treat someone who pays you money. You want money!? Treat people with respect. I kept my profile‚Ä¶ until I signed on, I had a notice about a $300 credit on my account. There was a red or pink box with a call to action to use a $300 credit.. so I sign up for ads again, to see if it‚Äôs worth it. A week later, I was charged 150$ for the ad‚Ä¶ I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE. They told me I should have screenshot the call to action and would NOT refund my account. NEVER AGAIN. I brought in one 80$ client, why would I keep paying for a service at 300$ or more a month, when you delete my reviews, disrespect my time and money, disrespect my clients time, and have created such a toxic environment for business. It‚Äôs like a shoddy Black Mirror episode, except it‚Äôs just some gross corporate shill. | I love how it has a waiting list for you | Excellent work. Beautiful job by Ryan and David. Professional and kind. My garage is beautiful. I highly recommend . Thank you. | So excited that there is a location near our house now!
Richard was very nice and friendly:)
Food was amazing as always | The beef Wellington is very juicy and tastes amazing. | I keep getting notifications about places to eat in Wyoming and I don‚Äôt live anywhere near Wyoming lol. There‚Äôs better apps | I just canceled my  2 contracts with this company. They said they fixed my air conditioner (at lease 3 visits). Then I called them about a water heater not working. It turns out they  DID NOT fix the air conditioner ( it leaked down to the water heater and ruined  it).

I canceled the 3 years I had contracted them . They would not fix the water heater that THEY caused the problem with by not correctly fixing the air conditioner.

They offered to gove me  $100 credit, after we spent thousands on their stinky warranty.

Anyone in their right mind should not deal with these cheaters.It would have cost them only $425 to put in a new water heater.

We are 78 years old and I have macular degeneration. 

You might even call this elder abuse!!

H. Little & J. Little | Your artwork is so beautiful and creative!
Leslie | Received letter  of. Rejectiob.

Every time I drive by and smell the fries I feel like a starving Ethiopian child on Ramadan week. | Paid over $200 for a pric fixe dinner tonight at Indian Accent in NYC. Such a totally underwhelming experience. I have dined there prior to the pandemic and couldn‚Äôt wait to go back! What happened Chef Vikas Khanna?
The amuse bouche soup was tepid and the flavors of the coconut milk clashed with a tart ingredient I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on
The first course appetizer chaat spheres were good but could have used a little more of the peas
The second course pav bhaji had red chili powder that was way too much and more importantly raw - I had to request butter (which they didn‚Äôt have) but were nice enough to provide yogurt to temper the taste of the raw chili prefer
The main course I ordered the Arbi with veg nihari- had some uncooked/ dry rice
I passed on dessert as I didn‚Äôt want to be disappointed further
Sad as I really looked forward to going back

Hope I have better experiences there. | Yelp is ok, but Yelp Guarantee is just for show. Yelp Guarantee is very effective in adding confidence that it would seem Yelp has vetted providers. However, when you encounter a problematic provider that Yelp guarantees, they will do all they can to delay and as much as possible not honor their so called Guarantee. Until now, my issue has not been resolved and their support takes all their time to respond. | The place where friends are made over torturing a wolf pup. Never go here!!! | Your not showing me the menu | I want to thank everyone, the Doctors and specially Yenny and Susana they are always so helpful and nice to everyone.

Thanks | Had such a good and relax time. Dinner was good pot roast tasted super yummy and Alma was our server super nice and helpful. Very attentive.

It‚Äôs such a nice new place in Islamorada. The food was delicious , stuff was wonderful, there is no better view , for sure we will come again . Thanks Charles that you came to our table to ask what we think about your place ! I think you couldn‚Äôt do better then that and you are so nice and handsome that immediately I offered you to get together with my daughter üßí, I wish you a lot of success in this place, you built it with a vision and a good one . | This is the worse Lexus dealership experience that I have ever had. I love Sterling McCall. I am a previous customer and when I went to look at a car today to see if I wanted to trade up I spend 20 min walking around with no one to greet me. I saw one many chauffeuring a couple who acted like he did not see me. There were 3 people at their desk watching me walk around.   Do yourself a favor for all of your hard earned money the it to another store! Do not buy here! | Terrific street tacos. Toppings the best. | Greattt | This company is trash. No support for bad reviews in areas. We have never serviced nor done business in. | Todo esta muy rico | Let us assume there is a hypothetical review that can be conclusively proven to be a lie. As long as it describes the reviewers experience, the review will remain. Meaning Yelp allows people to make libelous reviews and remain unpunished. | Started blocking VPNs, so I can‚Äôt review Yelp on Yelp. | Positive feedback matters. Thank you for creating a way for us to share. üíã | The real customer reviews are not shown, and it always shows that the reviews are not recommended! This software is not fair at all, very bad | 10 minute delay was told to pick any any chair on the plane for weight distribution from Kona to Honolulu.

Demanding people sit   20 seats back no one sitting in the exit lanes over the wings to open the emergency doors not required because that is not their emergency exit strategy! FYI, future flyers of southwest. Encourage people to inquire if this is standard for all airlines. | I called Precision Appliance Repair for a 
Issue with the washing machine.  They responded quickly.  The young man that
Came to my home , Thomas Cardenas
Took care of the problem right away and did the repair.  I was extremely satisfied 
With his performance.  Before leaving he took the time to put it thru a cycle making sure it was working correctly.  Thomas also cleaned up after himself which isn‚Äôt always the case.  The owner, Jayson was on top of everything as well.  I have some other items, smart appliances that I need help wit so they will be getting a call as soon as I have the time.  Thank you Thomas & Jayson‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Nesha was our bartender when we sat at the bar. She was very attentive, suggested our drinks which was great. The drinks were amazing. Food came out promptly and was hot and delicious. I would be returning and bringing friends and family. Will definitely be back as a normal. | Our server Edwin was EXTREMELY attentive, and Manager Melissa checked in on us a couple of times! My husband and I both got Victoria‚Äôs filet, and it was cooked to PERFECTION!! | This park has been cleaned up a TON over the last year or two.  No more homeless hanging out, clean public bathrooms with toilet paper in them, newly paved sidewalks and paths.  
They even have ‚ÄúA Little Library‚Äù next to the new children‚Äôs playground and fenced in park area.  They‚Äôve finally taken out the sand in that area too, and replaced it with poured rubber tire & entirely new jungle gym structures and drums/pipe tubes for the kids.  there‚Äôs not a ton of seating but it is shaded it looks like they‚Äôre in the process of putting in new picnic type tables last week when we were there.  There is no off leash area for dogs at this park but there is a Lisa Jackson down the street.  However you can take your dog for a walk there and go down by the Bay.  It‚Äôs nice! | App crashed when ordering from Olive Garden within app. | We order from Kim Shang at least once a week. The food is generous, very, very good and is ready in no time flat!!  The staff is friendly & accommodating. You can‚Äôt ask for a better takeout restaurant. We highly recommend it!! | Jeff just finished our laundry and powder rooms. Excellent job and extremely neat. | I have never written a review but in this instance I feel compelled to let folks know not to use this place. I took a trench coat in for cleaning. I purchased it in Italy. It had amazing details. Natural Cleaners completely destroyed the leather buckles on the sleeve and the very unique buttons. When I got the coat back, the buttons had threads hanging from all the buttons which, I reiterate, had been damaged. It was an absolutely horrendous dry cleaning job.  I immediately brought the coat back for repairs. They said ‚Äúthe owner‚Äù would call me. No one did. I had to call repeatedly for several days before getting a response 6 days after I brought the coat back. When ‚Äúthe owner‚Äù finally returned my call, he left a message saying they had ordered replacement buttons and buckles. I called back three days later to see when it would be ready and was told they did not know when I would get it back. When I expressed dissatisfaction about this given it had been now over two weeks since I took the coat in ‚Äúthe owner‚Äù asked what he was ‚Äúsupposed to do.‚Äù I asked him to give me $200 for the time and expense associated with getting the materials and coat and finding and paying a tailor to fix. He told me he would send the coat back to the store. He then hung up on me. For the amount I have spent at that store, the unapologetic and cavalier attitude from the owner - who I literally had to hound for a response - is clearly a statement about how he views his customers and the quality of work which is quite poor.

I would not use Natural Cleaners after this experience. | Used to not have this, and this made finding a restaurant much faster for me.

I was feeling when my classes I downloaded this app to maybe help me get my grades higher well after some questions on study Island the app made me fail, but I only got five questions right out of 15 AI did not help much but I have a little bit help from other classes with the help of AI, but the only thing the AI is not good for is reading writing language and textual evidence which all of this goes into ELA. help with other subjects but not a ela | Every time I try to answer a question it's a 50 percent chance of me getting right | Man Thank you i got all A in my clases | I would use this app on a test and I would end up with a 40%. Because it gives me wrong answers. What is up with that? Why can‚Äôt you just make it accurate. I don‚Äôt understand how people are writing good reviews about it when it gives me the wrong answers and make me fail. | Honestly at first i didn't really trust the app as much because i had read some of the rating. but once i tried it out for my self and got a good grade on most of my stuff i was rlly surprised i totally recommend this app if your home schooling or just virtual! | This app is not only for math it‚Äôs for anything!!! I love this app with ALLL my heart | this app used to be amazing and i loved it bc it was always accurate AND it was FREE but now after 40 pics u have to pay for a month?!?!?!? why would they make that change thats what made the app amazing? | i love it ! | Some times the answers are wrong and right I will still use it | Lowkey probably the goated app ever helped me get 100 on my civics test and I didn‚Äôt even know what the test was about | I tried a 10 question quiz with this and it got 2 wrong so I still passed but it will get a few wrong here n there u better off using chat | I have trouble with my homework sometimes and it always helps me understand the basics of the formula and how to do it | Got me kicked out of college because my grade was a 2 | This is so good it is definitely better than all the other photo mathsüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç | This app good for math‚Ä¶ even for free it‚Äôs still gud | This doesn't solve anything correctly | Es muy buena la app | Is quick At responding and Always gives me the best answers only problem is it should Be more then 40 uses without premium | THIS APP IS LITERALLY THE BEST I DONT EVEN TRY TO DO MY HOMEWORK ANYMORE BRO LIKE ITS SO GOOD I COULD DEPEND ON IT WHILE DOING A MATH TEST GOOD | For the life of this app it can not graph or make any answers shorter | This really helped me with my home work it is very acupuncture will recommend for everyone. | My first time using this app was wonderful the second time‚Ä¶ well not the best I was about on my 5th question when it gave me an answer that was no where close to my options I thought that my teacher was wrong until I went to class and saw everyone had the same answer expect me I thought it was just a silly mistake until it happened again as I read through some of the reviews I saw that they had the same problem too. I was so happy to find an app that doesn‚Äôt just give you 3 tries but I guess I celebrated to early. Especially after seeing the accuracy of the answers.üòï | Great app, helps me so much. | This app is so wrong now I have a 33 on my test | Me ah ayudado mucho con la escuela. | I love this app so much usually you have to pay a monthly fee but with this you don‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt buy it at first. I thought that we would have to pay monthly and I didn‚Äôt feel like getting the app but I gave it out a try. After I gave it a few tries and math questions I realize it really does help and that I love it so much,being in middle school and having tough math helps me so much with this even though I don‚Äôt really read the videos on how to do it sure helps with the answers and that is what it‚Äôs great about this app because you can help me with with my homework and if I need help it‚Äôll give me. I love this app so much definitely recommended you don‚Äôt have to pay any monthly fee and this is the first app. I‚Äôve actually waited five stars and left a comment because usually these apps aren‚Äôt good, but this one is amazing. Love it so much. Thanks. | OK SO THIS APP IS GOOD but here one problem I want to use the video but they only give u 1 free one and u gotta pay premium that‚Äôs kinda upsetting because some people can‚Äôt afford it so it would be really good if it was free overall this app is very good! I wish it was all free | the best app!! | It takes so long like bro hurry up. You guys should make it where it gives it instantly instead of waiting for a huge text to finish writing because no one has all day to wait for it. Most of the time the Explanation is useless and you only really need the answer. Fix this | If you looking for a app that you take pictures of your homework and you get the answer, this is the app for you. It works for all subjects too helped me pass this yearüñ§ | It takes too long to give answers and unnecessary explanations, gives wrong answers sometimes, says only a letter for an answer for multiple choice | This is the best app I have found ever. It‚Äôs such a huge help when you have a lot of work at once five starts of the batt amazing app. Y‚Äôall did a really good job on this app | Not only can it help with my math, it can make stories too!! | W app it can lottery do anything thank you app developers | Never trust this app it got me an f in math | Hi! I am actually passing my junior math class now, and I understand it. This app is great at explaining things fully and has given me correct answers on everything! Thank you, developer! | This app is ok but gives wrong answers sometimes I have the answer for a question but I still ask the ai for the answer and it gives me the wrong one even on the simplest ones | This app works so freaking good I love it so much when I‚Äôm doing my class work I thought you can only cheat on math  i didnt know you can cheat on reading ones this I so crazy I love this app so much. Only one bad thing about this app is that if you don‚Äôt buy something you are limited but everything else is pretty goodü©∑ü©∑üíñ | man i don‚Äôt even write reviews but this app did its big one

Deleting the app and account and will hire a realtor. | Zillow is groovy for multiple reasons, 
First of all, it granted me 6 pizza boxes. 
It gave my family a nice set of eyelash glue, 
And it fought off the beast on our roof! 
Zillow is the most groovy of all. | Terrible. I couldn‚Äôt find any answers to my question | The latest updates require that you login to use app. After using for years without logging in I find it annoying. I deleted it from my phone. Many other options in the web. | FYI. Since this recent update, none of the listings in an email link out to the app correctly‚Ä¶ it just opens the app and that listing is not shown?

In New York City, co-op fees can be $2500 or $4000 or $15K. That‚Äôs a very very wide range!! | This is the worst app ever. I have been apartment hunting I paid $35 to apply for different apartments and every time it‚Äôs asking me to put in my information over and over. I contacted support they do not reply. I believe I have been scammed | I am trying to list a condo for sale but it keeps showing me a similar condo that is already listed in the same apartment complex and asking me if I want to tour it ! | I recently listed my house through a realtor and Zillow listed the wrong square footage even though my realtor entered it correctly in the MLS (sent a screen shot to confirm). When I reached out to Zillow, it took them 5 days to respond, and they said the realtor would have to update MLS, which was not the problem. They were not pulling the information correctly. My realtor is now in conversations with them. She told me they took away realtors‚Äô ability to make changes, so her hands are tied. This is impacting my ability to sell my house. Do they not realize this actually affects peoples‚Äô lives and finances? Very disappointed. | Awful app | I use to love this app but something happened. I had several saved searches. But they are all gone! No more updates on houses for sale that I‚Äôd be interested in. | Used to enjoy the app but now get a screen calibration pop up that doesn‚Äôt clear and forces you to exit the app to clear. Only happens on the Zillow app. After doing some research this is a known issue that a number of users are having. | Your new anti-bot app is preventing access to the system by circling back to the validation incessantly | Zillow does not control fraud. Like their so called agents can partner with their clients and inflate the prices of rental properties. You will end up spending time and finally you get to know you have been cheated in the process. Be careful, don‚Äôt waste your time! | Great to be able research markets that we are looking to move to. Sometimes, though the information does not seem completely accurate. Multiple redundancies. Will be looking at property information and the app quits for no reason, very frustrating. 
Has some type of app running keeps wanting to move a red ball in a circle by tilting the iPad | No email or message responses | My photos don‚Äôt show up on the listing how am I gonna ever rent that apartment? And Google has monopoly on rentals on the Internet. | Zillow went woke. Are you sure you want to delete? ‚ÄúYes‚Äù | The Zillow app and website are horrendous to use. It‚Äôs not easy or straightforward. Searching anything send you down a rabbit hole. Want to leave a review, good luck finding where to leave. Zillow revenue comes from advertising $s and f everyone else. | Software is cumbersome when using an iPad. Works well on a PC.  Don‚Äôt carry a PC when I am shopping. Other sites offer info on flood plains, dining, hospitals, schools, and gas stations. | Can you please have a selection that makes it mandatory for them to indicate whether they are showing a full home or just a room. There have been so many selections that indicates that it‚Äôs a home they‚Äôre renting and when you finally read, it says it‚Äôs a room. It‚Äôs very misleading for a person who is looking for an entire home, which is advertised, but upon researching you find out that it‚Äôs only a room in a home. That makes me not want to use the app because it has been too many misleading instances. And if people want to be careful and cautious about who they rent to because they are afraid of scammers, you want to make sure that the person is not a scammer saying that it‚Äôs a home when it‚Äôs really a room.

- no way to enable or disable notifications on the app except by deleting a search and making a new search. Even then the notifications I can enable are for EMAILS. there is no setting for specifically mobile notifications 

For an app rated 4.8 stars the lack of these basic and properly working functionalities really  misses the mark | Never in my life have I ever had a problem using an app for the specified reason that it‚Äôs made for.

 That they go and dig through public records and then put my private, hard to find, information up on the Internet is highly unethical and offensive!

Now the only option I can put in is my down payment and credit score. I can't adjust the cost of the property any more. Like what if I wanted to pay 10k over asking price. Now I have to use competitor apps and sites that provide that option. | He‚Äôs was kind patient and very respectful and had my back 100 percent didn‚Äôt allow me to buy anything I was truly blessed to be paired up with Keyon Whiting thanks again for all you done for me and my family especially my fur babies we are so ever grateful God blessed you and your family | Tried calling to talk to a live person but all automated.  Automated system said to leave number and they‚Äôd call back and nothing‚Ä¶. | I reached out regarding a isssue with a listing, never received any help or guidance. | They have had my house listed as sold since May 2023. Since I‚Äôve seen it in September 2023, I have reached out to Zillow multiple times by both email and phone asking where they‚Äôve gotten this information as I have lived in that house for almost a decade, and have NEVER listed, sold or refinanced. 

Zillow has stringently refused to return any phone calls or even a simple email. Did someone steal my house? Is Zillow facilitating fraud and identity crimes (likely)? 

STAY AWAY!!! What other scams are they involved in? At the very very best, what they list is INACCURATE AND UNRELIABLE! At worst they are involved in FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT!!

If this was not the case, I feel like I would have easily gotten at least one response answering my questions over the last eight months. Guilty parties avoid answering these types of questions. Sounds like maybe an investigation is warranted. 

Despicable. | Thank you for making the app slower and slower by each update. | I need copies of my background and credit. | Never get a call or response back I have been trying to list my property for sale for over 6 months not once has anyone reached out to me even after I call and leave a voicemail and submitting a help ticket on there help request portal. Ridiculous! | The ‚ÄúUpdates‚Äù tab, that has your saved searches has a nasty little bug. When you try to edit your saved search, like from sold homes to for sale, it won‚Äôt save your new preferences. EVERYTIME you come back to the app, it reverts to the old saved search.

I‚Äôm prompted to subscribe to a plan, yet the start date is 1 month out - because I have an active subscription already. Typically, apps that support in-app purchase on Apple devices provide Restore Purchase functionality to correct this issue. The Peacock app doesn‚Äôt provide Restore Purchase functionality, it would be good to add that in the near future to avoid the customer service overhead from all of the customers that encounter this issue. Please consider adding Restore Purchase functionality. Thanks!

BTW kudos on the great improvements to your tech and content since launch! Great job! üòÄ | Now I Have Proof But I pay Money EveryMonth for this app Just for yall to say under the shows ‚ÄúNew Epsidoe Every Friday‚Äù Then Yall Advertise it And have commercials That is sick the past two weeks a lot of shows have not came on with a new episode.  So how does Every Friday turn into Every 3 -4 Weeks?  I don‚Äôt want yall Weak Robot Reaponse just fix it yall humans act like it dummy or I can just take yall to court trust me it‚Äôs not hard | It‚Äôs the best five stars | It is so good 1 out of 1 üëçüëçüëçüëç | My movie keeps freezing and the scenes are talking out of order | It is so good and has a lot of different choice love this app | Why want my remote work on my tv | Not all Premier League matches, Careful,  only some. I just cancel, thanks, I‚Äôll be back when you confirm you have all games available through Here. Good luck | Even though I have a premium account on Peacock, I still have to watch so many ads. It drives me crazy. I think Peacock offers some great programming, but the ads keep me from really enjoying the shows. I am not going to renew next year. | A 10000/10 this is awesome | Need to be supported in all regions of you want to be as great as. Netflix | It is not an easy app to use - you can‚Äôt find the episodes to get to a show without playing it - if the show is not on your list, it‚Äôs not easy to find the next episode if you‚Äôre not binging it or watching straight through- it is frustrating to have to rely on the app when paying for cable and then frustrating that their researchers didn‚Äôt try to do the same format as other apps so customers don‚Äôt get frustrated! Also auto playing another completely different show after you finish watching some thing is ridiculous and then you can‚Äôt get it off of your continue watching list which is also ridiculous. | My only complaint is that my viewing choices aren‚Äôt saved so that I can continue watching them from where I left off if I start watching other things . | Poor connection | Greatly to watching from my iPad‚Ä¶ | Thanks a lot | I‚Äôm surprised to say how enduring the array of bravo shows continue to inform,entertain and help me understand perspectives that aren‚Äôt in my daily routine. I‚Äôm rewatching episodes from real housewives as well as VPr , below deck and southern charm that at the time were guilty pleasures but feel were prescient chronicles of inter generational chasms as well as racial and societal inequalities with regional differences surfacing in ways that I was disappointed to find myself lacking. Even flipping out and other business makeovers with Tabitha made me think twice about small businesses. You‚Äôre a treasure | Peacock will skip the action to show ads smudging live play of a soccer game. Do not use this app if you want to watch sports. | The Apple TV app is horrible. 
It constantly gets confused and list the My Stuff for my wife when I am logged in.
I have to toggle between users to get it fixed.
It doesn‚Äôt correctly show you which shows you have watched. We have to keep track on the Notes app to log our watching progress. | Normally a huge peacock fan, I re subscribed to the premium plus and my account will not let me edit the names, it‚Äôs stuck on ‚Äúaccount holder‚Äù, won‚Äôt let change the profile avatar. It‚Äôs frustrating because I cannot set up names on it. I‚Äôve deleted it, re-downloaded it, all of it and it still won‚Äôt let me fix it. Sounds minute but I just want to be able to put my name on my own account. | Peacock is awesome! | The best serie ever made! Kevin Costner the best actor that ever lived. Amazing,incredible there are so many words that can describe that serie!!! | It takes forever to load into the app, even when there‚Äôs wifi. It also takes forever to play the movie or show, and yes I do have wifi. | I like the programming, but tired of having to go out and come back after each episode. Just not worth paying for. | Just watched werstlmaina it was insane thanks to peacock i am able to watch all the events that happen on wwe | The app constantly freezes the live stream, even when I watch it on my tv . Please fix this !!! | Other subscriptions doesn‚Äôt need data in order to watch something you downloaded this one does. | No controls in streaming TV devices 'Settings' for Autoplay of trailers, series etc. Cancel button to not continue is a joke. Forget it if you want to surf their choices unless you want trailers to scream at you every time you pause. IT NEVER STOPS. Don't try to put your baby to sleep while in the same room. Don't fall asleep as they will just keep playing the next episode. IT NEVER STOPS. Are Peacock watchers so lazy and so incapable of making their own decisions that they actually prefer being controlled like this? My husband watches NBC news programs or I would drop this service in a second. I keep the Mute button on the instant he opens the App on Apple TV. I used to like NBC on cable but now it's my least favorite streaming channel.  And ultimately what does this obnoxious behavior accomplish? | I‚Äôve sent several emails to cancel this service that I never ordered. Refund my money | Why is this the only app that keeps interrupting what I‚Äôm watching with the constant and excessive buffering?!?! It doesn‚Äôt happen on my phone, just on any tv that I‚Äôm watching. I have different tv‚Äôs and use all other streaming platforms on every tv with no issue, only peacock. | I was watching law & order and then it stopped while I was watching and locked the show for premium only now I have to pay more money just to
Watch a show I‚Äôve been paying for the account now I have to pay more this is outrageous | I like that I can give up Hulu and still have L&O, New girl, etc plus now The Office but the app won‚Äôt continue playing shows if you are only listening to the audio | Love watching my shows when I get some down time when my kids are taking naps üòé | Give us Peacock access internationally! For someone who travels for work a lot, total game changer!!! | The Chosen is very good | Air play is terrible on this app. Only streaming service I have a problem airplaying | I love that Peacock has wrestling. What I can‚Äôt ignore is the multiple, consistent crashes when streaming a video on a Playstation console. If I can make it through a 90 minute episode of RAW, that‚Äôs a good day. On a decent day I submit 5-10 crash/bug reports. On a bad day, the only thing that loads on Peacock is the ads. That‚Äôs the one, reliable thing I can say about their streaming service. If it wasn‚Äôt for wrestling I wouldn‚Äôt use this service or recommend others use Peacock. The repeated glitches, numerous crashes, black-screens that require force closer of the App, and the amount of bug reports sent that go unheard, are the reason why I reviewed Peacock streaming service on Playstation for a 1 star out of 5 stars. Update: As of April 18, 2024 this is still an ongoing issue. Update: As of 22, 2024 I have seen a significant improvement in the quality of the Peacock App on Playstation. I have since raised my star rating to a 3 star out of 5. | Every time I download this app and take it off, and attempt to log in, it says the password is wrong and I‚Äôm not putting the wrong password and it‚Äôs saved on my iPhone too ? This is an issue because I can‚Äôt log in on my tv and I changing the password? I lost count how many times I‚Äôve changed it. No the other app I go through this . | I‚Äôm subscribed to premium but yet I still have commercials, I wonder why‚Ä¶. | I just got the app but I don‚Äôt know how to download episodes. | KEEP TRYING TO TAKE MY MONEY AND DOES BUT I CANCELLED AND I DONT HAVE THE APP NOO MORE | The app is really clunky. Currently trying to watch Parks & Rec and I have to search for it versus it being in my continue view list. Thank goodness the content is solid. | I don‚Äôt like that when I press the back button it goes back to the top of the screen on the main menu where they advertise their 1-9 specials at the top, I preferred when it opened the side menu. It‚Äôs real annoying if I wanna go into the side menu and a press back and it sends me to the top of the Home Screen, the only other annoying way to access it is to scroll all the way back left on the horizontal tiles which makes me lose what movie I was hovering over when I wanna see the side menu

These problems are on your Roku app, stop changing things that don‚Äôt need to be changed | The graficks are the worst | Wrestling, great movies what more can you ask for | Peacock always supples its costumers with a good amount of movies , makes the cost of a monthly admission worth the effort | I wish y‚Äôall would create a way for us to delete shows that we don‚Äôt want to continue watching. I tried to fast forward the shows and the next episode comes up in my ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù row. It‚Äôs so annoying! 

Please advise. | Needs more audio descriptive viewing movies and TV shows | From the beginning, this app has been horrible. The Office is my favorite show, but I got rid of this subscription because of how awful it is. I decided to give it another go, and it doesn‚Äôt always save where I left off from, it switches shows randomly, and now it has ‚ÄúSkip Intro‚Äù permanently at the bottom right, and God help you if you accidentally hit it when you‚Äôre in the middle of a show.

Once it was so easy and now I can‚Äôt do it. Can you help me and tell how to find the tools | I don‚Äôt know what the heck you guys did but this app is totally unusable now. 

I have an iPad and have continually used Google Earth. 

It‚Äôs fun to search the world for all kinds of places and see them from a global perspective. 

Every time I turn it on now within two or three minutes giant white blocks show up, huge patches of the map disappear and I can‚Äôt see anything. 

It happens most of the time with 3-D, but even happens with 2D. 

After about five minutes of use I can literally no longer see anything it‚Äôs just a big white blob. 

I have to actually use other apps like Apple Maps now to see 3-D stuff because it is no longer usable. 

I wish that I had never updated the app. 

It all started when this happened. 

Also, the pictures that you see associated with a location you put in now I cannot zoom in on the picture I can only just look at it as is. 

What gives? 

Why did you make an app that I loved absolutely horrible and unusable?!? | Surprise Arizona is one of the largest growing communities in the Valley of the Sun with residential, commercial and industrial development throughout the city. Yet, Google refuses to make more frequent updates to their app. Updates to the app or anywhere from 3 to 5 years behind. | Baaaaaaaa | it‚Äôs a great time passer | I love Google Earth. It‚Äôs my favorite app for a geographic nerd.. but the most recent ‚Äúbug fix‚Äù update has made it absolutely unusable. There‚Äôs more bugs now.

Please, please fix this! | When I use this app for siren hunting the app just glitches weirdly and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on! | Google maps when viewed close looks like a very cheap 3D cartoons that a cartoonist would draw while high on eating magic mushrooms.

It would be even better to have an AppleTV native app so you don‚Äôt have screen mirror from phone to watch the games on the big screens!!! | One thing if you didn‚Äôt have to pay to see the stats 10/10 app. | Signed up for the subscription. Being military can‚Äôt be home for every game so I bought this for 29.99 a year and can‚Äôt see any home games and away games I have to know someone on that team to view video. The audio is literally Siri going over the plays and super delayed. Use the free version | Love using GameChanger! I am able to add multiple teams and view stats, videos, chat with the team, and view the schedule plus much more. Helps keep me organized. I pay for the premium version so my son has access to all of his highlights. We love viewing them together and keeping track of his stats while he improves. Such a great app! | Love my Warriors, thanks for keeping me updated!!! | Love the app! I‚Äôd love if you add some minor things such as being able to edit pitches from at-bats (for example change a ball to a called strike at any time); I‚Äôd also love for you to add automatic strikes and balls so I don‚Äôt have to do the math on pitchers pitches! As well as making it easier to do balks since it‚Äôs confusing, the last detail I‚Äôd like is for adding for pitch types like a splitter or sweeper | This is a good app it‚Äôs good to see when you have a football,baseball,softball and many more games and you can see your team and the coaches so yea you should get this app. | Get rid of the pre-video stream ads. I pop in and out of streams and see ads over and over and often miss the AB I was trying to watch. This is an unnecessary annoyance that is reducing my time spent on the app. Parents and coaches are going through the trouble and expense of streaming these games to parents who can‚Äôt be there, and you are getting in the way to try to make more $ off their efforts. | I started using GameChanger when I lived in California. My grandsons were playing baseball in Florida, and it was a great way to watch the games. My pastor used to joke about my watching GameChanger during church, but a grandma has to do what a grandma has to do. | Great app, does a great job of tracking stats and is easy to use.  My only criticism is that it is an incredible battery hog.  Do a 2.5 hour game it will use half the charge of my full charged, brand new, iPhone. | My grandson plays AAU and high school baseball. I try to attend every game and have Game Changer on so I can be up to date on innings, score, etc. It‚Äôs  also great if I‚Äôm not able to attend the games and can still see how it‚Äôs going. Thank you. | Love it | We can‚Äôt even watch our videos without getting a subscription, seriously üò©.
We basically need a subscription for everything and it‚Äôs just worth it to ask our team how we did and to show us some vidios. Seriously | I play for two baseball teams currently and both of them are on gameChanger and frequently updated but the thing is I am under the title as player for both teams, but I‚Äôm really wishing that in the future that you put a feature that if you apply and are approved for player on the team, you should be able to see your own stats because I see my coach every game putting up the stats for the game, but I never know what my stats are so and I hate that I would have to buy the subscription just to see my stats which I wouldn‚Äôt have any other purpose for the premium otherwise | We have a 120 mile trip to see our grandson play Baseball.  Since we can‚Äôt get to all his games, Game Changer lets us watch him play when we can‚Äôt make it in person.  Thank you! | I am Cole‚Äôs Grandfather and I live in Bastrop Texas and I am able to watch Cole‚Äôs games on my phone and it‚Äôs great 
Thank you | Can developer please help??? | It seems like when my wife and I split up to go to our two boys games, either she can follow, or I can follow. We‚Äôre never able to be on GC separately and still follow | Generally speaking, I love this app for both baseball and basketball. One update I would love to see is the ability to see previous searches or to bookmark teams that the user has searched and found. Most of us coaches use the search functionality to preview other teams we‚Äôll be playing or to track teams that were interested in following. Having to retype searches each time gets tiring. | I enjoy the app and find it very useful. However, how on earth can you justify raising your price from $50 per year to $90 per year?!That is ridiculous. | Too many features are locked. Otherwise it works well as a team organization & messaging app. | I dove cold into this to keep score this year. I would suggest a league level localized training session to kickstart this. | Great App for baseball, but they need to enhance the staff settings to allow scorekeepers to have access. Not all coaching staffs scorekeepers the game. | App would not work. Purchased a subscription but would never bring up the game, just a blank screen. Wife had same issue. She attempted to contact them by reporting issue and received absolutely no reply, no action. 

Don‚Äôt waste your time on this app. | Great app to review my stats | If you have a team GameChanger is your app because you can watch the game even if you played in it because it is live | Great app for players and coaches. Clear communication with intuitive interface. Easy to schedule games with player RSVP. Set lineups and have real time play-by-plays for parents not able to attend games (used for softball). | Thank you for this wonderful App! Recommended!! | I say this because when I can't go to a game I can still watch the game. Also I can see directions to get their. Also we can message if we have questions. This a great app that I love. | It is bad I hate the app it‚Äôs glitchy | When viewing the video in landscape view, the score banner is across the middle of the screen. It blocks the view of the field. The only way I have found to fix it is to delete and reinstall the app. Very annoying for something that costs nearly $100 a year. | This app helped me with all the sports my family does! When I want to see my brothers baseball game it‚Äôs helpful if I‚Äôm not there or not, if not I can see what‚Äôs happening if I am it helps if I want to know the score | The two years I have used the service it has been great way to follow the games ! | Would be nice if GC would sync with android better. | So glad I have Game Changer!  Sometimes we are unable to attend the games and Game Changer brings it to us.  Love it!! | I really dislike taht we have to pay to see the status and the games & it's very unfair especially as a player . Alot hi this app is very useful it's has its things..

(btw idk what this says bc when i was typing it was blending in with the background !) | I‚Äôm a working Dad that loves the app! It allows me to keep track of my kids games even when I‚Äôm not able to attend. The streaming service gives you live game feed which makes it almost feel like you‚Äôre there. | I have been using Game Changer since it came out and always found it the best. Has only improved over time. Our rep Anna is the best. | I can‚Äôt get to all my grandsons games BUT this let‚Äôs  me feel as if I‚Äôm there .. supporting them! | No support for the Apple TV,  fire tv or chromecast?  The website is an infinite loop of sending verification codes over and over again.  Old people trying to watch a baseball game on a phone is just silly.   Better than nothing I guess. | Got the subscription and didn‚Äôt let me watch I video or hear the sound one star | Of Course GameChanger is the Gold Standard for baseball/softball scoring and streaming.  I think a great add on would be Apple CarPlay for audio/GameStream. | Would get 5 stars but need an Apple TV app. Too complicated to mirror phone for grand parents or older family to watch the kids play | I like Game Changer and having all the videos and stats at my fingertips. It's especially wonderful for the family that lives away to be able to watch the games. Only wish you also highlighted the junior variety teams. They are important too. | Cant even create a user account. Once I get to entering my name it freezes and won‚Äôt move forward. | Great app but drains the battery too quick! | As a long distance family member, GC allows me to feel part of my family & current on important activities.  GC is definitely the second best option if being physically at an event is not possible. üôÇüëèüèª | I love Game Changer and have been using it for a few years. This year, when I‚Äôm watching on the livestream at home in the horizontal orientation, the scoreboard graphic goes through the middle of the screen and blocks the view.

Really disappointing. Even submitting feedback is clunky, not that anyone is reading this or will do anything about it. Shameful user experience | I was unable to open the version I had last year, so I deleted it and reinstalled today. The screen advised me to upload the last version supported by my iPhone, so I did. But now all I‚Äôm allowed to see is an overlay screen telling me to ‚ÄúUpdate Now,‚Äù which I just did. How am I supposed to buy tkts or show them @ the gate? MLB and Apple are in an unholy alliance to grab *all* my money - but if I have to spend another grand for a newer phone I don‚Äôt want, I won‚Äôt have a dollar left over to buy a seat in a ballpark. This SUUUUUCKS! Guess I won‚Äôt be seeing live ‚öæÔ∏è this year. | My friend forwarded tix on his email . I clicked ‚Äúaccess tickets‚Äù. No tickets showed up on my Ballpark app. Frustrating. | Sometimes it‚Äôs working other times it is not.  Really lame‚Ä¶ | Not easy to use | This app was great for years. But now I can‚Äôt access my tickets because it requires iOS 16.0 to use! I would happily update to 16.0 but I‚Äôm at 15.8.2 and my phone says I‚Äôm totally up to date!!! | Bought tickets, received email confirmation, followed instructions to set up Ballpark app, but tickets won‚Äôt upload to app | Friend forwarded tickets and because my phone doesn‚Äôt support IOS 16 I can‚Äôt get to them. What do I do? Everytime I try to log in it says to update and won‚Äôt let me bypass and when I try to update I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not about to buy a new phone today. | I keep getting a something went wrong error when trying to register. Tried resetting password even though I don‚Äôt think I ever registered and no password sent. | Can‚Äôt find my tickets after multiple tries to access.  Hate it. | Something keeps hanging up on my iPhone - not working.  Then I try to use my PC and it says you can‚Äôt use this device. I have to get these tix and I just want to go to bed.  Technology takes a step forward and two steps back‚Ä¶. | Had a typo with my email and can not change it on the app. Which led into a series of issues trying to log in to access my tix | The app will not allow me to open my tickets. It‚Äôs keeps saying it is in the wrong format.  Anyway to correct this before my game??? | i have purchased tickets on the game time app. I was then directed to download this app to retrieve my tickets and have yet to receive even AFTER verifying multiple email addresses | Can‚Äôt open my Yankee Tickets! | Can not transfer tickets easily. Cast me money | I‚Äôve used the app in the past with no issues on my iPhone 10s, but now it‚Äôs saying I need to update the app to retrieve my recently bought tickets. I can‚Äôt update the app because I have an older phone that won‚Äôt accept the update. So now what? I bought tickets that I can‚Äôt access without buying a new phone even though I have zero issues with any of the other apps I use on a daily basis. | I can‚Äôt find the parking ticket I just purchased.  Takes me to the game link. Talk to Amazon on how to simplify. | Doesn't allow VPNs, buggy, just all around not great. | I got the app to try to buy tickets and I can‚Äôt see the schedule for any team. The tab that says ‚Äúfull schedule or home games‚Äù is blank, never loads up the page to buy the tickets. Never had a good experience with this app on either iOS or Android | Thanks for making my tickets unreachable. My mobile device doesn‚Äôt update to version 16 so now what do I do?  MLB doesn‚Äôt care about their fans just the $$$$ | Why is it so difficult to get my ticket? Why do I have to go to both Ticketmaster & the Ballpark app? HELP!!!! | Won‚Äôt let me sign in | had trouble cancelling forwarding and recalling tickets. they showed an error message multiple times and prompted me to contact customer service üòï | This this third time I watch Angel baseball, but it‚Äôs the first time I got a ¬´ lucky ball ¬ª, great match, nice ambiance. | I can‚Äôt get my tickets for May 5th game. It refuses to verify my email. Very poor site | Did this app crash?? I‚Äôm trying to download so I can receive tickets and it simply won‚Äôt let me. Super annoying. | This is the only way to access my ticket and the app does not work on my iPhone.  It requires iso 16 or higher and my updated version is 15.8.  The old app worked just fine but the new app forces me to update to something my phone will not allow.  So frustrating every time i go to the ballpark.  Please Fix your app!!!! | Refuses to let me log in to accept forwarded tickets. I know my credentials are correct but I went to reset password and it won‚Äôt let me. So dumb to make you download this trash just to access a ticket you already own | This is soooo fun my son got free food for every home game I recommend to come here | Just open the app with the email you purchased your tickets with and you‚Äôre all set ! | Tried to get tickets for first responders and wouldn‚Äôt allow the use of the code. When I resolved the issue, the code was no longer available. Making things way harder then they need to be. Go back to paper tickets. At least give a option for a paper ticket. This makes you want to never go to a game again. | This application is stating that I cannot access my tickets because I put in the wrong email address, but I put in the correct one verified it. It still does not have my tickets. Hopefully somebody who will actually answer this and help me find tickets.
I I also tried to put in a help ticket, but it refused to let me submit it. This is the worst app I‚Äôve used in a long time. | I can no longer run the app, as it won‚Äôt bypass the update option even though it allowed me to install a previous option compatible with my phone. I‚Äôve wasted a ton of time trying to get the earlier version to run. How stupid!! We all can‚Äôt afford to change phones every 3 years because of these app updates aaaargh | I‚Äôm just having a hard time navigating this app | Can‚Äôt find my tix‚Ä¶. üòû | This is ridiculous that you are forced to use this app for baseball tickets | I‚Äôd give it negative stars if I could!!! I‚Äôm required to use this app to get the tickets I just purchased for a baseball game tomorrow. But I can‚Äôt get an account to set up. After calling to report a problem, then being given another number to call who couldn‚Äôt help, I was given the another number to call. It was Saturday night the game was Sunday, when I called that number I reached a message that said they would be available Monday. Too late. Couldn‚Äôt use my tickets, bought some from a guy on the street and now I‚Äôd just like my money back.

And you call this a response?! This is just some robo answer | To many fees.  Such a shame üòû | Very hard in this app to have tickets for multiple stadiums. That‚Äôs a common occurrence and should be fixed | It is NOT the easiest app | I have bought tickets for three different teams this year and the experience has been different with each team. This is very disappointing. If they had zero stars that‚Äôs how I‚Äôd rate it | Tickets sent to mlb app, could not get because app wants to update however my phone won‚Äôt let me. Had to buy extra tickets at venue. Other tickets are unable to be used. | I want to be able to talk to a real person regarding issues. Not a bot, not an email, I want a phone number. | Can not find my tickets after purchased TWICE , FIX THIS | Too many connections between MLB Ticketmaster and other apps so I bought tickets and can see them in MLB but ticket master says I have no purchased tickets.  Having to sign in and out with several accounts to find what should be easy to use.  They should go back to PrintAtHome! | This app and MLBs new e ticket only thing has single handedly turned me off to MLB. Requires a degree just to access your ticket. Can‚Äôt imagine the twenty something who thought this was a good idea | When i click on my tickets, it asks me to sign into ticketmaster but keeps showing ‚Äúerror try again later‚Äù | This app is horrible! All I want is to see standings and the schedule. All it wants to do is sell me tickets.

So I reset my password but I still cannot login with the new password. What happened? Someone can help? | I love to use the starbucks app so i can save points up and i usually put my money into the starbucks card to get double points. Sometimes starbucks will sign me out of my account, usually no problem, except last time they signed me out when i signed back in the money i had in my account was gone. i‚Äôve tried calling the help line a couple times and nobody would answer and when i tried the live chat they redirected me to call them. | I love the attention | This app was working, but for quite some time now it no longer does.

It‚Äôs worth it if you drink Starbucks daily | Works well, love the benefits | I enjoy using the app, but when the wrong card was charged I was told in order to get a refund I would need to be charged again. If there is anyway to avoid using the app and just ordering in person, highly recommend doing that so things are done the right way. Customer support was no help and from a $45 charge I was told I could only be refunded $2.67 unless I wanted to pay another $45 then they could refund me $45. if you do use this mobile app, make sure you don‚Äôt want to change anything at all because there is apparently no way to fix any errors. | Works 43% of the time.

Please fix. | You guys need an option to reload custom amounts in the app. I like using my Starbucks card to order, getting double stars compared to one when using PayPal/other options, but I hate how if I have $5 something already on the card and I need only $2 more to get my drink, my only option is to then reload a whole $10. That‚Äôs absurd. Other than that, I have no issues with the app. | It makes it easier for me to grab my coffee in the morning. | Love | They are so good at service! The mobile order is super helpful and easy! | I used to really like the app and the point system but year after year I see it becoming harder and harder to earn more stars , and the cost of items has gotten higher :( Starbucks makes millions of dollars a day they can keep their incentives reasonable.

983156458,"com.microsoft.azureauthenticator","Microsoft Authenticator","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?uo=4","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication

Multi factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you‚Äôll be asked for an additional way to prove it‚Äôs really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app.‚ÄØThe OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don‚Äôt have to remember the number. The OTP doesn‚Äôt require you to be connected to a network, and it won‚Äôt drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless

Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you‚Äôve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you‚Äôll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill

Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts

Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/9b/52/94/9b529485-4990-f633-e922-9d5e38723d3b/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-10-0-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Productivity"",""Utilities""]","[""6007"",""6002""]","Productivity",6007,"4+","[""AR"",""EU"",""BG"",""CA"",""HR"",""CS"",""DA"",""NL"",""EN"",""ET"",""FI"",""FR"",""GL"",""DE"",""EL"",""HE"",""HI"",""HU"",""ID"",""IT"",""JA"",""KK"",""KO"",""LV"",""LT"",""MS"",""NB"",""PL"",""PT"",""RO"",""RU"",""SR"",""ZH"",""SK"",""SL"",""ES"",""SV"",""TH"",""ZH"",""TR"",""UK"",""VI""]","205058048","15.0","2015-05-30T09:25:44Z","2024-04-24T13:16:06Z","We're always working on new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

Just awful! | Logging in = hard (due to super slow email of required link). 

Paying = hard (no Apple Pay)

Logging car = hard. 

All in all, not a great experience | I feel like this app is a scam now. In two different incidents I paid for parking in Redondo Beach CA and the meter was still showing that the time expired. I reached out to Park Mobile once about it and never heard back. It literally just happened again today, which is why I am leaving this review. | Apple Pay not working in the app. Credit cards are not accepted unless they have an American post code. 

Basically unusable for many people, which makes it strange that a tourist place like Miami Beach would select this service. | After upgrade to Ver. 24.14 the app will not let me sign in. No text link  is ever sent. IF a email does come to you‚Ä¶it will ignore your app and push you to the website which is also broken. My mail is not on a browser but a stand alone mail app. I would be happy to go back to the old version 24.10 or better yet the old enter a name and password and forget about text/email link. Note: yes I contacted tech service and after 10 days of poor service‚Ä¶and no fix‚Ä¶I may be ready to give up. My case was sent ‚Äúup to  higher level‚Äù so I will wait to see if I get any help. | Rent seeking. | This app sometimes works, but often doesn‚Äôt. Worse, you can choose Apple Pay or PayPal as your payment method, but the app then REFUSES to accept these payment methods, what? .. you can set it up but the it says but supported AFTER you have entered all the parking data. And no way am I trusting these guys with my credit card. Go use PayByPhone which is a great app. | For those of us that cant remember their IoS password at 5:30 in the morning, this app is very frustrating. Seems not uncommon that I get to jogging trail early in the morning but it wont let me park because it‚Äôs decided I need to upgrade, again. So then I have log on to computer to find where I wrote down my password and finally I get to update.Bad start to the day. How about only forcing an update if it is actually a crucial update. Thanks‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs another annoyance: 24.14.0 refuses to go away. I click update, and a week later it comes back asking for the same update. | ParkMobile has started sending me promotional advertising via push notifications, and there‚Äôs no way to turn this off in settings (despite there being a notifications configuration page). This is a misuse of the notifications feature. | Very convenient and it can be used in many US states | It‚Äôs bad. Between the frequent updates, it doesn‚Äôt keep my password and somehow no longer accepts my method of payment. Of course I don‚Äôt know this until I have to park. I wish there was something better.  How does this app have 4.8 stars?  I don‚Äôt see any reviews that begin to reflect this rating. | Why have an app if every time I open the app it needs to send me a link to my email to open and most of the time doesn‚Äôt let me pay. Also when it lets me it take so long. The whole purpose of an app is to make it easier and faster and this app does the opposite. If PayByPhone can do it why you can‚Äôt | So many quirks | This app should have a dead simple fast UX when pulling up at a meter. But no. So many steps. Just bad design and especially poor usability design.  It could use apply pay. It could have a great login flow.  Easy vehicle selection. But no‚Ä¶ | They wrongfully forget your license plate every time. They intentionally refuse to let you use Apple Pay. They never let you add any cards manually as it just throws errors. 1000% unacceptable. Expect a lawsuit for you and any politician who attempts to enslave their constituents with such malicious software. Shame on your existence. | I paid for parking but I received a ticket. And when I contacted ParkMobile, they left my high and dry and told me to contact the authorities that gave me the ticket since they have nothing to do with it. So now I paid ParkMobile and I have to pay a parking ticket because the town doesn‚Äôt account for my license plate in the ParkMobile database. Hmmm. Seems weird that I paid a fee to ParkMobile but they never forwarded my fee to the town. Fraud? It may be. Hmmm‚Ä¶ | Saves a lot of time | The new update kicks me out of my account and won‚Äôt let me sign in.  Now that it‚Äôs send a link to the email. And it doesn‚Äôt ever send | Tried to park at work today since they closed the free lot. No payment kiosk in the lot so was forced to use the app. I had my old credit cards on the app and tried to add my new one. The only options available to me were to add paypal, which I don‚Äôt have, or to preload a minimum of $25. I could not even edit my previous card information or remove them as all that changed was the expiration and CVC when I got a new one. Horrible user experience. | Once we learned how to use the app, it made things very convenient. it‚Äôs nice having the receipt show up in my email. | Updated review: after reviewing our receipt, I‚Äôve figured out what happened. There were two UX failures:

1. Due to a lack of clear signage, I paid for parking on a Saturday. Turns out weekend parking was free in that zone, but the app did not indicate that anywhere. It gladly took my money - and set my parking expiration time to the time when paid parking starts on Monday plus the duration I paid for. 

2. The Live Activity immediately began counting down the duration I paid for. However, the main page of the app showed the Monday morning expiration. So, the Live Activities are bugged: they are setting the countdown based on the duration chosen rather than the expiration time, even though there are cases like above where the expiration time may not be ‚Äúright now + duration‚Äù.

Really the bigger fail is #1 though. The app should indicate when parking is free and recommend against paying. That was the whole reason I paid through the app in the first place: no clear signage around, so I had hoped it would indicate the schedule, but it didn‚Äôt. | This app is unusable. I reloaded the app and tried to park today. Won‚Äôt take my password and never sent a link. I had to spend a few xtra $$ and park in a garage, which I don‚Äôt like to do. Fix this p0c app! | When I found a spot, I found parking number and setup time, done. If want to do extend, just put time and pay. | this is the best app i have ever used. it works so smoothly and so clearly. do not change a single part of it. i love it just the way it is | What kind of an app loses all your stored information when it forces you to update? This is truly done of the worst programming I have ever seen! | App has intrusive notifications advertising themselves. Please stop! | What concevable reason is there for pausing my music? There aren‚Äôt even any audio cues. | Login with email does not work. No code sent. Have to contact help for them to tell me to enter my phone number in email field to get in. And not possible to change default pay. Yet we‚Äôre required to use this app to use public transportation. How many barriers would you like to throw? The help (after 1000% useless help bot) was effective, but took effort and time.  get it together guys | Love the app - it‚Äôs easy to use and replenish when needed - great for the beach I never have to go back to feed the meter just set a timer to replenish | Recently tried to use this app for parking in Florida, it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to pay. I tried adding a new card, tried using Apple pay, tried restarting the app, etc. After many, many attempts I gave up. Went back to the car and I had a ticket. Reached out to support and they were unhelpful and seemingly didn‚Äôt understand what I was trying to tell them about what happened. Ugh, very frustrating and expensive experience with this app and customer service. | This app is terrible. It is so frustrating that you need so many different parking apps. To be able to reset your password is so incredibly frustrating. It doesn‚Äôt work. Unfortunately, if you want to park in a particular spot, you need the app. So why would a city or town bother spending money on an app that works. | Should be able to transfer unused time  to another parking are | Found a parking place and parked last night. It would only let me pay for the amount of time left before free parking. Woke up this morning. Renewed my parking. It keeps track of the amount of time you have left for you. Probably haven‚Äôt even found out everything it does at this point. Keeps your credit card on file. Keep your numerous cards on file so you don‚Äôt have to go around re-entering everything. | Sending a login link via email is one of the least secure methods for logging into a site. Do you know how easy it is to execute a man-in-the-middle attack with that method?!  No respectable site or app does this. Please rethink that requirement. | Screw every designer of this app. It‚Äôs like you hate anyone who wants to search or navigate. This app is garbage | The genius who made the decision to not enable log in via password, has never found themselves in a parking lot with the app the only available method of payment, only to find out you‚Äôve been logged out and the only way back in is via email that never comes!  How about changing that!!! | I think this was one of the best things that happened. The parking space is very low cost and you don‚Äôt have to worry about paying expensive parking tickets. Thank You. | Love the convenience, certainly beats putting change in a meter. One thing I‚Äôd like to see added, that would be a very helpful feature, is the ability to zoom in and have better resolution of what zones cover what streets. currently this isn‚Äôt that accurate, and you can accidentally get the wrong zone identified for the location you‚Äôre car is currently at. | Come on man.   Would be so easy to check out using Apple Pay.   Rather than dig out a credit card it is tempting just to walk away if my visit is short. | App incorporates Nift adware | It‚Äôs everywhere now, it‚Äôs convenient. It stores the places I frequent. It‚Äôs just so much easier then searching or holding into coins to pay the meter.  One good thing, I never knew that the first hour is free who knew. I love it, I give it a 10 | I have been using this app for years and it only gets worse. Zero customer service. | Best app invented no more tickets ever put your vehicle information in an press 2 buttons walah | I live in Dallas and parking is horrible! I ONLY look for the big green sign with the parking numbers! It‚Äôs affordable and convenient. I‚Äôll walk a little to park cheap. PLEASE never change your prices!!! Lol | It glitches. I parked the car and paid for it. Then i went to check if i need to extend or not. App didnt show, and i said ok book for another time and paid. Openned app again and i see i have 2 time slots with different time of remaining. What a ripoff? Test your app, and fix bugs. This is ridiculous | I pay 25 cents for 30 minutes in the app is 80 cents it‚Äôs too much money | I rate this 5 stars because downtown in my city I got used to inputting coins and ever since I downloaded this app and used this new mobile app it‚Äôs been way easier and fast to purchase time for parking. When I‚Äôm far away from my parking spot I can add more time from a click of a button on my phone, no need to grab dirty coins or walk all the way back to add more time. Best app I ever used for parking meters. I really hope they add them to more cities! | I found this app while on vacation in a busy location, and it was convenient and easy to use. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no option in the App for cancellation of service and charges. You need to open a help ticket and send a few emails. Annoying and inconvenient. I also had to block them with my banking institution. | Could be more intuitive, but very easy to use didn‚Äôt know how to enter the parking spot number at first but I figured it out.
