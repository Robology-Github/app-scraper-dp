SEE IT ON A MAP

Every time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.

STORE PLANS OFFLINE

All your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.

GET ON THE ROAD

Looking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.

COLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS

For group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.

STAY ORGANIZED

Access flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.

GET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION

For each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.

CONTROL YOUR SPENDING

Set a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/04/99/7d/04997d95-7783-c032-fbaf-0eeb52bbbd68/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","106180608","13.0","2019-08-22T07:00:00Z","2024-04-11T22:31:17Z","Wanderlog's available in more languages!

I used it to group places I wanted to go together by distance to make best use of my time. The links to descriptions and websites so i could show Japanese addresses to non-English speaking taxi drivers where to go was perfect. Will definitely use again. | i’ve been using wanderlog since 2021 and it has been an amazing way to help plan my trips! I love the map feature and it makes planning travel and the actual travel so much easier and a smoother ride. Definitely recommend for type A travelers! | I liked that you are able to see the places you want to visit in a map, that way you can organize your itinerary by area. That helped me creating my route to my trip to Japan. I will definitely use it for my next trip. | This app is so amazing. I highly recommend it. After using it to plan a 4 month trip I love it. It does all it says it does. A thing or 2 I could only do on the app or on the computer but I could do all it says it does. On one thing I had a question and got a quick & detailed response from the developer (email is in the help section of app). | I was hoping this would work for road trips. Things do do from Point A to Point B | Just got back from a 9 day on-the-go Spain trip.  Wanderlog made planning the trip easier (being able to visualize everything on the map and drag-and-drop places to different days/times was great!).  We put in all of our flights/trains/rental-cars, restaurants, sites...  And my wife and I were able to collaborate. I'd get excited seeing her putitng in a Flamenco concert she booked for one evening for example. And then on the trip, it was so nice to have one place to reference for everything about our plans. 

I can honestl say Wanderlog made our trip better than it would have been. | I literally unsubscribed from the free trial offer five minutes after adding it and was still charged. And with you’re “refund policy” being only if an enforcement company requires you to, you actually don’t care about your users. Just greedy. I would like my money back | Great app for organizing your trip!  From collecting reservation information to identifying attractions to creating itineraries. It does it all. Highly recommended! | I’ve been using Wanderlog for close to a year now and very much love the app + website. For each destination, I start with a master list of places of interest. Using existing lists are extremely helpful to make the master list. Then I build an itinerary from it. Adding approximate time spent at the place and the app providing time between the places helps a lot when planning. What I’ve been most impressed with is the robustness of the app. I haven’t had any issue with incorrect information, data loss, app crashing or unavailability. The UI / UX is very intuitive. They have quite a few other features that I can being useful. | This app has made planning vacations so much easier to organize! I love how simple it is to build my itinerary and see how things are situated on the map. It’s also great for tracking how much money I’m spending! A must have for travelers! | Well, I was told I would get notification after my free trial period before they took my money. But that did not happen and they refuse a refund. So try at your own risk, but you might get your money stolen. | I don’t ever really write reviews, but I love to travel. I had mostly been writing out my itineraries on paper, but than I decided it might be easier to do with an app. So I downloaded a bunch, like 10, and just tried them out. Wanderlog was truly, by far, above the rest. The budget feature in particular was fantastic, I went to Europe with a bunch of friends and it was really helpful for tracking expenses, and the fact that it automatically converts currency within calculations is really helpful and a nice touch. I now use wanderlog every time I travel and I really love it. | This app has it all. I love all of the organization. The mapping is the best part! I also love knowing how long it will take to get from place to place. The only drawback is, in some there google driven guides the places are closed for good. | Love the sharing option. Makes itinarary so much easier. | This has been amazing app from throwing ideas together to really finalizing the smallest details.  However, what is more important is the support team, I spent months putting a trip together and accidentally deleted it, within hours they were able to restore my trip and save me hours of recreation, and many more tears. | One of the best apps i used in japan, it really organized my trip. | first of all, it is deceiving when it says sign up for the pro version for roughly around three dollars a month when in reality you sign up for the annual price it does not give you a month-to-month option. 

Second of all the pro features don’t even work the whole point was for it to pull your itinerary information and add your flight info automatically. instead it pulled old itineraries from the last year or two that are already irrelevant. I don’t understand why it would search that far back and my most recent emails with the upcoming flight info couldn’t even be added into the app. I had to manually add my flight info. 

third of all as soon as you create your account, your bombarded with 20+ pop-ups I selected no more tips and it’s still kept coming up with all of these pop-ups. It was so annoying. | Would recommend it to anyone 
Help me and my girlfriend sort out everything we needed easily during our travels | I acquired this app based on its outstanding reviews; however, it has proven to be a profound disappointment. Not only is it functionally inadequate, but it also requires a subscription. Rather than providing useful suggestions, it merely retrieves articles about activities in various cities, a task I could easily perform myself. My primary desire was for quick itinerary suggestions, a feature this app fails to deliver. Additionally, its incessant interruptions to offer tips on its interface only compound the frustration. One must question the design decisions that led to such a cumbersome user experience. | Such a nice app to lean on when you have a trip planned and have a lot of cooks in the kitchen of planning 😄 | Really great app | I have waited all my life for a way to plan trips this efficiently. Thank you for making such an incredible app! I tell everyone about it. | This app helped me keep a month long multi-city trip through Europe organized.  I love that it has the ability to forward emails to your itinerary and it will upload the confirmation directly for hotels, transit and other reservations.  I was able to share it with my co-travelers and they can add points of interest and help with to-do list and wish lists.  If this can keep me organized so easily, then it’s definitely worth it! | If you’re a freak about organizing your trips, everything about this app is spot on! | I tried this for LA and it had locations WAY far off like Palm Springs Liberace house. It also had a charity museum that had no activity on instagram since 2020….unless I’m missing something.  Also the charity location is an hour away from the location I input.  It had a “permanently closed” restaurant listed.  Wasted my time.I don’t get it . | this app would be amazing if fully worked!! won’t let me add certain places to my lists. no reason. just does nothing when you click add. don’t have this problem using the web version ?? | I use my home town in Delaware and asked for it to suggest some places to go out to eat. Well it picked three places I never heard of, the name of the town was right but they were in Canada a few hundred miles away. 
Ok so I understand this is a trip planner but I’d love to have a better control over where the heck this AI thinks I should go. Nope, not going to buy this one! | So helpful!! This made our trip so much better. It makes planning easier and more fun, and traveling so much less stressful. Love the map feature where you can see the layout of your itinerary. I kept everything in my notes app before and it was a pain. You need this! Love the free features too. | I love this app! I can make checklists (packing lists and lists to help me remember what I need for each daily adventure). The way you can forward a hotel or flight or rental car reservation and it automatically adds it all to your itenerary including confirmation numbers, addresses and cost for your budget is phenomenal. I love how it offers suggestions on sights to see and things to do and places to eat. Plus all of my friends or family whom I invite to share it with can also have all the information right at hand. I’d give this app 100 stars if possible. I’ve used it for 5 trips now and will never use anything else. | A great app for traveling together with friends. Easy to upload accommodations, schedules, and finances. If you are traveling with friends this app is perfect. I highly recommend it!!! | Ever since I discovered Wanderlog, I’ve used it to plan every trip I’ve been on and have told anyone who will listen about it. The app’s itinerary building functions, the option to create different lists, and the ability to share with others makes it indispensable. It’s near perfect and I recommend the following to the developers: allows old trips to be archived automatically based on dates, allow blocking for nonspecific activities in the itinerary, incorporate the visited map from the web into the app, and add a feature to organize places you’d like to visit by continent, country, etc. | Overall this is an amazing all. I’ve always used google sheets to plan my trip because the alternatives weren’t great. For the first time, I started using an app that solves my need right from planing to on the road. 

Having said that, the app is slow when you add many locations. Additionally, the drive times are incorrect on the app. So I have to switch to computer. The route optimization cannot be done across multiple days. If some of these can be fixed, I’ll be happy to pay for the app. | I’m type A personality and I knew for my trip I needed somewhere I could write down an itinerary. Wanderlog was that and more! I loved being able to plug in all the things and have everything in one place. Thank you thank you thank you! | I had great hopes in using this app. However, it is not sophisticated enough to insert manual planning. I have a trip already planned that I tried to set up in this app and it just doesn’t work. I already have plane tickets, hotels, cruise, etc. It just won’t let me EASILY add everything. Not worth the effort in trying to figure it out. Stick with the spreadsheet!! | I downloaded this app to plan a roadtrip to the Philippines. I love how simple and customizable it is. I also love that you can share it to people and they don’t have to download the app to view or edit it. Most locations I need are searchable. It’s mostly free until I want to save it offline which is great because I can plan free before my trip and only pay for it when I need it.

Some suggestions that would make this app even better: 
- Having the option to make certain pages private
- Being able to mention your tripmates and make action items so it’s clear on who is responsible for what
- Being able to pool money as a trip mate and assigning who is responsible for paying. I feel like a lot of group trips, there is a designated person for food, lodging, gas, etc.
- Being able to customize the color of Notes. I have a few and it blends in really well with the Places because they are the same color.
- Being able to assign sub-budgets, perhaps by Place you’re going to or by type of expense (food, lodging, gas etc) | We used Wanderlog for the first time on a 10 day trip and it was amazing!  Easy to set up, great recommendations!  Will be using for all trips from now on. | Please make this app compatible with Airbnb!!! It’s a pretty good app, but there seem to be a lot of minor glitches. I really like that it gives me a time frame to get from one point to the other and it creates the most seamless transition, but it is super slow and I can’t add accommodations for Airbnb. Also, once I’ve gotten rid of a box, I don’t want it to keep popping up…it’s incredibly frustrating. | Wowed by the amount of information I can find in this app. Wanderlog has asked and answered all of the questions you have about traveling, organized them and put them all in one app. SO useful!  I'm just at the tip of the iceberg and can't wait to explore more! | This app really was essential in the planning of my trip. It allowed me to make a list of all the things we wanted to do and see and then work to fill in the gaps!  I referred to it when e had some down time or looking for a place to eat nearby. | Literally the best app for planning trips. So easy to use and able to collaborate with friends! | Loved this app. It really helped me plan for a better trip as to maximize areas and sites I wanted to see. I will definitely use it from now on when planning. | Very User Friendly!  My son recommended this app and honestly I was hesitant. I normally turn to paper and pen. But boy what a revelation this app turned out to be; so convenient to have everything in one place. Loading travel plans was a breeze!  Adding places to visit was easy. Also the app provides ideas for stops. Love it. | I had plans to use this and after 1 week got a hard stop. | This app has every feature I would put into a travel planning app! I am thrilled with it! | I am really enjoying the app. It would be helpful if there was a driving map, so we don’t have to use other apps for planning. | I used this app to plan my trip to Japan and absolutely LOVED how easy it was to plan out all the restaurants, landmarks, train stations, and hotels on the map and organize everything into their own respective categories! I found it so helpful that they also auto color code the points on the map based on the category I put them in (I put them in categories of cafes, restaurants, transportation stops, etc.). I had the best trip all because I was able to add all my notes into this app, and now I send my itinerary to everyone I can and always tell my friends and family to plan everything using this app! | Wonderful app! I love to able to save all the places of interest and it auto populates in the map & numbered too. Great for organizing my days on a trip and even adding what restaurants I want to visit etc. Super helpful app and very easy to use! Love it and highly recommend it. | This app totally changed how I plan and travel!!! I am recommending it to everyone I know. We went to Berlin as a family of 5. Everyone had access to the itinerary for planning purposes. And I, as the planner, was able to put all of our trip details (and all my research) in one place, making a huge improvement in how we sightsee. This is a very robust and useful travel tool! | I have always used Roadtrippers until they started ripping people off with their prices.   I made the switch and really like using wonderlog now.   It is different from when I was used to using, but I think I like it a lot better.  I love the easy way you can keep all of your documents together in one place. | I really hate planning trips…not because I don’t enjoy picking out cool places to go, but because I struggle with things like timing and organization. This app really helped me to put together an itinerary that included all of the places I wanted to go, plus gave me a few suggestions to fill in some gaps.

It does its magic in the background and the notifications are great. Highly recommend it. | I’ve travelled 830,000 miles and using the app since 2008. I love it. Feedback: would love to see more detailed insights on past travels. In this sense I enjoy Flighty. Hope to see this in TripIt! | Everything organized in ONE place.  Remind me for delay flight & check-in time etc... | We used this app and everyone knew what was on the schedule for the day 
Easy to use and email notifications were great | I stumbled upon this app about 5 years ago before it became huge and my opinion has never changed. It’s such a great app, it’s simplistic and stays up to date as you are on the move (literally!) it is totally worth paying for in my opinion even if you don’t necessarily fly to travel,, you can still make smaller itineraries. It is one of the best apps out there! | I luv this app, it keeps my entire itinerary when I travel in one place and I get alerts through the TripIt app before the airlines send updates. It’s amazing. I highly recommend. | Have used this app for a couple of years now after trying several. I like the rate change notifications as well as changes gate changes and other reminders. Dust wish it was easier to upload travel itineraries created on ChatGPT/or other AI to track the entire vacation. | I do not find a way to contact personnel at TripIt.  Poor customer service options-currently | Not sure how this app has not been acquired by the likes of Apple or some big outfit. It is beyond AMAZING. 

Works like magic and makes checking emails for trip information a thing of the past. Don’t travel as much as I used to but when I do, TripIt is a must use app for all aspects of the trip. Lifesaver!! | Could not upload anything but airline schedule. I will go back to manually generating my schedule and itinerary.  I’m not sure if it was user error but I have given up. Great concept. | This app looks nice, but the ridiculous amount of time that I’m spending to just
• get my trip info imported from my email 
• take my phone number to push SMS messages
• to not have to enter all this info manually
•to not have to forward the info to an email to send to this app
• to figure out how to effectively refresh this app and maybe it will retrieve my flight, hotel, trip reservations..
• see that I just purchased to pro and it still has not populated my upcoming trip..

Is giving free app vibes, when I know I’ve spent money… | I have used this app for over 10 years and consider it one of my go-to apps for travel. It’s simple and easy to use. | Enjoying organizing our trips.   Amazing app.   Worth the effort to have everything organized.   Especially like having it flow to my Apple calendar | Can’t sync email. Can’t edit things within itinerary without it freezing or just not loading or giving errors…seems like it could be a great app tho | I don’t travel much but when I do I use TripIt extensively. It is extremely useful and helps keeps me on track. | Not happy with 25 pdf limitation  AT ALL.  I have a 3 week trip coming up and certain arrangements and tour details will need to be maintained outside of App. Questioning whether Trip It Pro is worth it. I love the app, but this is the main reason I upgraded and spent the money. | TripIt is awesome! I travel frequently and TripIt lets me have all the info I need right in one place without having to lift a finger. | For my trip I booked flights with several different airlines. When I edit the confirmation number for one flight, it saves that confirmation number as the new updated confirmation number for all of my flights on the trip, even though all of the confirmation numbers should be different. | Comprehensive & intuitive app! Pulls all travel plans from email. I receive notices before the airlines notices come through. | I googled for a trip organizer or some sort of reminder for events. And this app popped up. And it was the best decision ever. It made everything so much better, timing, reminders organizer itinerary. I got to do a-lot more of activities and events on my trip thanks to the app and is easy way of keeping everything including address and tickets store and at hand. | Love that it tracks my trips, airline ticket numbers, hotel confirmations, etc. but what I REALLY love is that I can look at it and immediately see when I will be out of town. Yes, that info is already in my calendar, but TripIt segregates my travel schedules in a much more accessible way. Perfect for capturing all of the other vacation/travel related items and categorizing them appropriately. When someone asks if I’m available in September, I look at TripIt first.  That provides the overview. Also, I can share all of our plans with my husband and traveling companions. And I can share my travel info with family that are not traveling, if anyone needs to contact me. Great app. | I just received an alert from TripIt saying that the price had dropped on my flight by $160. Just called the airline and got my $160 credit.

I also like that, all of my reservations are in one place car, hotel, flights. It even gives you warnings when things don’t look right. | This app not only helped me organize my trip and order the activities, but it is SO simply to get everything added! And you can share it with everyone on the trip so everyone has all the information and access to tickets, etc. I would give this app 10 stars if I could! Well done! | This is so great to plan your itinerary. | Excellent app. | Just started testing out this app to see if I want to purchase the pro version. So far it has kinks that need to be fixed before I’ll pay for it. When adding multiple flights to a single trip, it won’t allow you to have multiple confirmation numbers, even when selecting different airlines. I book a lot of separate tickets so this is very frustrating.

Updated to add that if you forward the itineraries, the confirmation numbers are correct. It only glitches if you enter them manually. | This app works the best for coordinating your vacations itinerary. Just email your confirmation s and it sorts out date time and everything. It’s especially helpful in keeping you in sync with the location time zones. Highly recommended for anyone going on trips. | Love the ease of the app. We set up a special email for tripit that we use for all trip notices that integrates with tripit. We have done 370 trips and don't plan on switching apps. I love that Pro keeps your history. I love the text alerts they keep me on the right path and saves me so much time. Everything I need for a trip is here. | Trying to access app, unfortunately crashes started to happen with notice that app is temporarily unavailable. Very disappointing. Removed/Uninstalled app and started again to try and login, same error. | I love the idea everything is in one place but It’s taking forever to add documents and keeps freezing so I have to close and restart every time | Love how it imports trip info from my email. So easy to stay on top of flights and hotels | It is so helpful and so easy to use! | This is my favorite app of all time. If you travel you need this. Easy, even for old folks to use. 10 stars. | I’ve thought this was a solid app for tracking travel plans, but had a wonderful surprise today when I received a text that my Southwest flight in 2 months was $60 cheaper (same flight) and not only told me to call to get a flight credit, but gave me the number. To say I was happy is an understatement. | Love it | Love to organize my trips on this app. Added bonus with Tripit Pro- they notify you if price changes on your flight allowing you to request refund! Love it | There are certainly areas to grow.  But, from my experience this the best and easiest app to use.  I do wish when I send confirmations for events such as concerts, sporting events, tours or excursions it would do a better job in adding to the plan with the appropriate event type. 

My wife and I share the travel planning.  This really helps us keep track of what’s been purchased and what still needs to be addressed.

 In the future I could imagine this app or a competitor leveraging machine learning and/or AI to do something special.  Probably would get purchased by one of the big players in the space like Expedia or booking.com | Love the one stop shop for tracking all my business travel

One thing. I wish that when I check into to flights it would allow me to add the boarding pass to my apply wallet, but I have to go on the website to do that, rather than TripIt. I mainly fly southwest so it may just be with that airline. | I’m having trouble importing new trip details from my emails on file. Not sure why this stopped happening. | TripIt is my favorite travel app. I don’t know how they do what they do, but they always beat the airlines when it comes to providing flight delays, cancellations, and gate change notifications. if you travel a lot, TripIt Pro definitely is worth it. | I’ve planned two trips in a few weeks. I’ve used this app and it has made them so easy. I have coordinated a trip for three people with three different airline itineraries, nightly dinner at six different locations for the week, to and from transportation and events. Talk about an easy effort, everything set up automatically and I was able to email it to the folks involved! Thank you for creating an app that actually does what it says it’s going to do and works so effectively!! | Simple and easy to coordinate hotel/car/flight information. Simple to look back and find the info as well. | I have had this app for about a year and I love, love, love it. I usually have several trips in the planning stage. This app lets me keep track of everything in one place. I easily see exactly what I have booked from flights, hotels, tours, restaurant reservations, theater performances and just about anything else. It is easy to use and edit any change of plans. I have recommended this app to friends. I am so glad I have this app. | It has been a great help to me in organizing my trips. | Oh my God I just learned about this app today and played with it for 10 minutes and it’s so helpful to organize my itinerary and saved me a lot of manual work. I’m totally impressed. | I have almost 4 million seat miles on AA.  I use this for every trip business and personal.  Saves a ton of time and it organizes everything involved in travel.  It’s awesome. | This travel app is absolutely amazing!
Create a trip and send confirmation emails to input!  Helps you catch errors, make sure you have no gaps, etc. includes all transportations, reservations, lodging etc with all the info you need in it. | Was seriously loving this app to plan a big trip with the family. Lots of planes, trains, hotels to keep track of. Once I realized the max PDF files was 3 with the free version I immediately upgraded to Pro to then only find out that they once again maxed out at 25 uploads. Geez…. It was my main reason for paying! | This is the best app ever I shared it with two friends that are not Internet savvy, and they are very excited to use this for their upcoming European trip.  My friend and I are able to share our updates and I love the expansions on each location that provides more detail that we don’t have to look up. I do wish they could add some sort of budget where you could see the total of your budget at the top or something but other than that it’s amazing. It’s a great app they can be used with, anything you’re doing on your trip and I love the chronological order | I’ve been using KAYAK for a while to plan and share trip information, but it isn’t a perfect tool, so I thought I’d try TripIt for a while. 

It is easy to add your plans to TripIt, just forward it reservation emails; Kayak does this too. You can also enter or change details manually. Tripit is somewhat better than kayak for this. 

With TripIt, it is easy to share a trip with participants who can update the trip with you (e.g. one person works on transportation, another on lodging, etc). The whole trip collaboration thing is easier with TripIt than KAYAK. 

The subscribed calendar support in KAYAK is much better than TripIt. With KAYAK you can see all your trips, including flights and lodging, on your device calendar. I can easily see how my trips fit into all my other plans. Other people can see my trips on their calendars too. I just share a calendar link with friends and family so they can see where I am and how to reach me on their own device calendars without using the kayak app at all; they like that. 

Tripit also supports subscribed calendars, but doesn’t include the detailed plans.

When I was planning my trip,  I put in more then 20 stops, because I was trying to see what all my options were in terms of activities, restaurants, and hotels. I meant to remove some of the stops, but before I could, without warning, the app locked my trip and is demanding more money for me to unlock it. I spent a lot of time planning my trip.  I booked my hotels, now I can’t go back and see what I did unless I pay more money! That’s so mean. I now have to plan everything out again, because I refuse to pay a ransom for my trip. I was having so much fun before this happened and I was going to recommend this app to everyone, but this experience took the wind out my sails. If I were you, I’d try and find another company, because I feel this company is a bit deceptive and unethical to lockdown my hard work without warning or a grace period….at least on my first trip so I could figure out how they’re system worked. Such a shame. | Trick you into membership and offer nothing unless it is premium.  You have to scroll in super close to see any attraction and can not see large overview of the area on the map.  Makes it impossible to discover something new.  Total waste of my money for a basic membership. | I’ve had trips planned and had access. Even if an email was sent, I should always have access to my previous trips while paying to use the app.  Prices increased , and trips are now limited as well as stops. I no longer can access my past trips that I’ve paid for and created. Currently, prices keep increasing you now you have to purchase plans. I will no longer use this app. You should have access to your past planned trip! Greed!! I no longer recommend based on continuous price increases for the same access that I use to have. | This app auto renewed at $36 but all the features that were once available have been removed. Even though I paid $36, it  requires  an up charge to actually create a road trip.  Google maps is much better and free.  I’ve been a subscriber for several years and every year the app has less and less features and costs more.  I’d never recommend it. It is worthless.  I can’t even access my previous trips.  What  is the point of charging me a subscription?  I feel completely ripped off. | Really hard to use and lots of spam. Even after unsubscribing | I love Roadtrippers. I use it to plan and route all my road trips. It’s so easy to add n take away waypoints to plan accordingly. It shows highlights and shows off the beaten path places within your distance you tell it. Shows mileage, hours, and even estimated gas cost which is pretty close. | Took us to places that were so fun and all the choices it gave!! Love this app | Little to no Help available. App navigation is a nightmare! | What a huge disappointment!  We have recommended this app to many friends and used it for numerous trips since 2021.  We ultimately subscribed in 2022 at $29 per year for the unlimited stops and completed one cross country road trip in excess of 10K miles.  The features to find interesting stops were what sold us on renewing again in 2023.  We completed another major Northeast road trip last summer and when we were notified the price was increasing to $35.99 a year we felt it was still worth it for the memories we were creating.  Now when I went in to share a previous trip with a friend I find that all my past road-trips are locked and to view them I have to pay more money.  The new tiers reduce the number of stops per trip to barely what was allowed with the previous free version (20 stops vs 15 stops).  They say they notified people of the change, but I cannot find an email alerting to the drastic reduction in capabilities for a significantly higher membership subscription.  The FAQ page states no refunds are available so I guess I am stuck for another year with a useless subscription (I have fixed my automatic renewal).  I do feel the company was not straightforward with warning existing customers with the severity of impact that was coming (losing access to all previous trips, reduction of waypoints per trip, etc).  This was really masked when they gave you the same capabilities for the remaining subscription period. Very poor customer service and loyalty to existing paying customers! They way to fix this is to restore access to previous trip that were purchased under previous plans and give an additional transition period for previous paying customers.  When we discussed our journeys with friends and mutual road-trip enthusiasts, we always provided raving reviews about this app.  Instead of having an ambassador for their company, they have now created someone who will trumpet their deceptive business practices! | Please help me cancel my subscription. I am not using this. It did not work the way I thought it would. | Love this app - the camera quality is amazing. Use this everyday | This app was great in 2018, I did the week trial a couple weeks ago and within an hour I quickly realized that the app was much different and far less helpful than it once was. Ultimately used google for everything I needed.  Now being a few days beyond the week trial period I’ve thrown money away because they’d rather have a bad review than issue a refund from a polite email. Too bad. | I am having so much trouble figuring this app out! | I used to absolutely love this app, used it on a few trips from CA to TX. But like all good things, now they want to charge you an arm and a leg to use it and there is no monthly option! I’m not paying $80/year for a 7 day trip. Might be worth it for anyone taking 4+ trips a year but why in the world can’t it offer a monthly option? Won’t even let me look at my old trips now without paying and no free options at all any more. 👎🏼 | I’ve used this app for over a year and i was pretty satisfied with it To be honest.
Then when i got requested to renew my plan (which i was about to) i noticed that not only the prices went significantly up but also the features included shrunk and i would need to get the most expensive plan in order to get back access to my older trips.
This is disappointing and made me not renew my plan yet.
Pretty bad move guys! | Not only did this app give us bad information during our cross-country move, they will renew your subscription without any warning whatsoever. Basically, they think their customers are suckers and treat you as such. It wasn’t worth the price I paid a year ago when I actually tried to use it, and it certainly isn’t worth the price to have them sneak the charge through without giving you the opportunity to opt out. If your business model is to rely on people to forget about their renewals rather than to provide a product or service that people WANT to continue paying for, then your business is a failure. | I expected Roadtrippers to be a source of information about places we plan to visit on an upcoming roadtrip but instead of being an interactive guide I can only set a trip place A to Place B and a map is shown between those two places. We are planning more of a wander to get from A to B looking for interesting spots to visit on the way, restaurants, local interest, but this doesn’t seem to be what Roadtrippers is about. Glad I only paid the introductory price. | Fine | The app is amazing ive been using it for 3 years now, recently the pricing structure changed since i only do 1 roadtrip yearly it didnt make sense for me to pay for the premium tier, so now i have a trip already planned that i spent 10s of hours putting together which i cannot view anymore unless i upgrade to premium.

I understand when services beed to go up but this is not the way to it. I did reach out to customer support to atleast be able to view my trip that i already created so i can copy it down or something which they refused, 

unbelievable! | I had used this app before and signed up for the trial to test it out again. Meh. Frustrated that the expensive annual subscription went through a week later with no courtesy reminder or anything. I know this is how they get your money, but it’s really soured me on the app. I’d be much more happy to give them my money if it was a monthly subscription so there was a lower buy-in for short trips. | I absolutely LOVE this app (and the desktop website). I could go on and on.l about it. I’ve used it to plan out three mega road trips for me and my boys and without RoadTrippers, my drive would have been boring and predictable.

If I had just used Google maps I would’ve stopped at a theme park, a zoo, maybe an overlook. Instead we found an insane and unknown rock formation, the actual grave of Dr. Pepper, a tiny military museum in a tiny town, a parrot sanctuary and a trail of cherry blossoms in peak bloom.

I love that you can collaborate with others that aren’t premium members. I love adding stops along my trips and having the driving/mileage info for each stop. I love seeing reviews and photos within the app so I don’t have to go googling. I love it all.

I got my mom onto the app and now she has used it twice as well to plan a regular road trip and an RV road trip. Apparently, the app shows where RV hookups are and is a dream for traveling with an RV.

Never going anywhere without checking this app first!! | Don't try to use this while you're driving you'll get a wreck | The features of the service were nice and very helpful for planning a trip, the real problem is the ridiculous subscription plans. When they first switched to a subscription based model it wasn’t great but it is a helpful app and supporting the developers is total fine, so we were fine with it. Recently they’ve updated the plans again without notice, and has locked us out of almost all of our trips that we had already planned (with no way of accessing them other than to buy a new subscription model). Finally just switched to google maps because it’s free and can save our trips without fear of no being able to access them. | You have to pay and you can only pay annually. | Stop the spam!!!! | Stopped along my route at a wayside rest area.  Without touching the phone, it then rerouted us back 14 miles onto a route that was about 100 miles longer.  Sorry I ever subscribed | Seems fairly straightforward and intuitive. Still early but I like it. | I’ve had this app on my iPhone (fairly new iPhone) for about an hour and it’s already crashed a dozen times. Every time I try to put in a destination it locks up. Add RV info it locks, try to open up to see what the annual fee is and it locks up. Every time I have to completely close it down and start over. I tried reloading the app and it does the same thing. I’m going to play with it a little more but if this is how it works I certainly won’t be buying the upgrade or recommend it to anyone
Update: after removing the app and reinstalling it, it’s just as bad as before. | Luckily I caught it before our trip, but this app completely messed up our trip from California to Vancouver. In fact, don't bother with this app if you're going to Canada at all. I spent, not hours, but days meticulously planning a 3 week roadtrip. Only to realize that this app's routes become incomprehensible north of Seattle. | Really enjoying the app so far. But noticed that there’s no option to select French cuisine for travel. Also, for hotel stays, would be great if we can search by hotel brands. | Unable to choose from different routes. Like the ability to find hotels and campsites. | I entered my trip destination and get a blue line indicating the route but it covers over the interstate designation. Major interstate highways are marked and coveted over but no other roads or highways are indicated. When the route has a change from interstate to state, county, other, roads theres no designation as to what road it is. I tried zooming but that was no help. Since I'm not provided a navigational list this app is really of no help to properly get me safely to my destination. So tell me whats the big deal with this app? | You make it impossible to stop renewal you only want to keep my money. The only way I can find to stop the renewal is to cancel what I have paid for. Not good | gotta get a subscription for more than one place on the route bruh | Turn by turn directions are inconsistent and  not enough lead time to make turns.   Does not appear to be Apple phone compatible | I find it difficult to use! | This was acceptable at $30/mth for access to 3 different apps, but when you only camp 6 times a year for it to double its cost for the same functionality, then tier off the value of the app with functions that brought you to the app in the first place is just price gouging. | This is a really good app. Definitely recommend it. Mostly an easy way to put a trip together, plan stops, construct a map. I would give it 5 stars except for a few very frustrating things that drag this app down. And could easily be fixed. I do understand that maybe it’s user error, but … When you are on a trip, you open the trip and it goes to your current location in Map View. However, when you open the List View for that trip, why doesn’t it go to your current location instead of starting from day one and you have to scroll all the way down until you find what you’re looking for. The way dates are managed is a complete nightmare. Changing the dates of an entire trip is such a hassle. And you cannot plan a trip without dates as once you add your first date, the app puts every single waypoint on a separate date!! Who thought that was a good idea?! You can add things that are not on the map already, but you can only add an address, you cannot label the address as to what it is. There are a lot of things that are not included on the map that I would like to add to my trips. And label with a name. This app is not a standalone app. You need other sources to complete the picture. Especially because there is a blue line indicating your route that completely covers up the highway numbers. Highway numbers are essential to trip planning. Also, can you update the gas pricing? It’s no where near accurate. And organize the trips into past and upcoming/future? | G Maps and this nav system come up with  same routes which is not conducive for RVs.  The previous togo rv nav system was way better | Not easy to start navigation - ridiculously hard to do. | Interesting app. Paid the $60 fee and used it for a single road trip. Was pretty useful at setting up driving routes and ranges, similar to the old AAA TripTik. Found some good restaurants and museums along the way. 

But it has mediocre UI/UX. It dumps a bunch of OTHER people’s road adventures into the place where you store yours. Whenever you open it, you have to go digging for the trip(s) you’re working on because Roadtrippers figures you more likely want to see what others have done in an area you aren’t even visiting and that’s more important than your own trip! 

Think about asking a friend to hand you your hammer and instead they hand you random other tools in your box until eventually your hammer shows up. And they repeat that over and over. Wouldn’t be relying on that friend for help, even worse if I were paying them. And that’s how I feel about the experience of Roadtrippers- $60 a year to have it throwing up random adventures from other people when I bought it to focus on my own trip(s) is absurd. I can find plenty of these types of stories in more detail on YouRube or other websites- I’m paying for this subscription for a “professional” tool that focuses on MY road trips. Far too much noise and clunky navigation. 

The reason it went from a 3-star experience to a 1-star rating: apparently it’s rigged to make it impossible or near impossible to turn off the subscription. You follow a link from the app to log into their website, go to “manage subscription” or “turn off auto renewal,” and it takes you to yet again ANOTHER website for a company called “Stripe.” And does “Stripe” let you manage your subscription or turn off auto renewal? NOPE. Stripe wants you to put in your email and they claim they will “send a link” so you can log in. And the link is good for 30 minutes. BUT- the link never arrives. Tried it twice. So, Roadpass/tripper and Stripe have apparently designed a rat trap where they can claim to let you turn off auto renewal, but there is no way to do so. 

Come the end of my subscription and if they try charging again, it’ll be an instant chargeback with my bank. These sorts of schemes need to be called out for the fraud they are. And Apple may need to be advised this is going on behind the scenes, even though it’s a useful app, the trickery in preventing cancellation is abhorrent. | I was on auto renew. The price last year was 29.99 for unlimited plans with unlimited stops. It renewed for 35.99. Five more dollars, OK. But for three trips with 20 stops each. All the trios except for one have a lock sign on them, so the app isn’t even registering that I am a paying customer. There was no notice or email that the plan was changing. And of course no refunds. Will NOT be renewing | Used this app for the first time and it DID NOT take us to our Destination. Don’t trust it now and won’t use it again. Good thing my Trailer is on the small side or I would have had issues. | Killer app just learn how to used this app and it is worth every penny | This is annoying. I have logged out and logged back into my account but cannot see the trip I created on my desktop computer through the phone app. The phone app is not recognizing my user name or email and will not allow me to update it. Spent $60 on the annual membership for the premium package. | roadtrippers and campendium are supposed to be merged, but there is no campendium info here. | Very hard to understand what you actually have access to. Tried to sign up for all 4 apps but found out I only got Roadtrippers not Togo and Campendium like I wanted
Dallas Willard | Seems like developers might have forgotten about this project? I put in a 1,200 mile road trip and it couldn’t find a single gas station, a single hotel, almost anything really. It found 3 major historic land marks that almost everyone in the world has heard of… so whats the point of this app then? And you want people to pay for something as well? It’s scary to see junk like this being advertised. Seriously, I feel like i’m living in the movie idiocracy sometimes. | Wow, I couldn’t even figure out how to use this app before I ran out of free tries and they wanted me to pay for the upgrade. Why do they assume you want to plan a trip starting from your house? I wanted to find out what things there were to do once I leave Austin on my way to Marfa in a couple of months. It kept putting my current location there and wouldn’t let me search between two points any other way. That’s how I lost all my free whatever they called them. Boo for this app. They don’t even explain how to use it properly! Nowhere at all do they explain me what I need to do.

Links and documents are seamless from emails,  webpages, maps, pictures, anything you want to add to your itinerary is done. It is extremely user friendly, easy to update, change, delete or add something. Reservations directly from your multiple emails (including my friends) upload instantly into my itinerary. I love being able to choose my own background pictures for my trips and see them all lined up on my phone. I do wish there was a print feature and maybe a rating system for entries in old trips so i can remember which restaurants/tours etc were worth it and which to skip although i can always just put notes so I’m nitpicking. Really well done and i love not having to worry about adding too many documents or links or trips. Excellent app for travelers! | I love how I can put in items without an and time.  Having issues syncing between devices.  Don't like if you just assign a location as ""afternoon"" it will show at the bottom of the day's itinerary vs in timeline order. Parking also doesn't show on itinerary, but does have it on the main trip page.  I like it better than TripIt and Wonderlog. | I'm a longtime user of TripIt but just switched over and it's 95% of what I was using before. The one (very odd) omission is that when importing flights, for some reason Tripsy doesn't read the name of the passenger—there doesn't even seem to be a field within Tripsy to store that information. It's a very strange product choice, as it can create confusion when a single trip contains multiple flights for multiple people. I emailed the developer about this but didn't get a response. Anyway, it's not quite a dealbreaker and I'm otherwise really happy with Tripsy—a great translation of TripIt's functionality into a beautiful, Apple-native experience. | La aplicación es hermosa estéticamente. Para mí nunca funcionó porque quise compartir el itinerario, el cual me tardé demasiado capturando, para que nunca pudiera compartirlo. Me salia un mensaje que estaba sincronizando con su nube y nunca lo pude compartir. En una lástima, pero tuve que regresar a TripIt. 😔 | I am a Tripsy Pro subscriber and like this app. I use it for dozens of shared trips a year. But it has major problems with editing events. 

Half the time edits don't stick and you close out of an item and find it totally unchanged on your itinerary. 

Time zone support is also a disaster. Time changes don't stick, trips and events move around the world from time zone to time zone. There's no consistent anchor or method to handling and entering times. 

Perhaps all the problems relate to the way the app stores data. Its sync just doesn’t work well and you need to be aware that data loss can occur. Sometimes events revert to previous versions hours after a change was made. If you move an attachment from one event to another, sometimes the attachment will simply disappear; it is neither on the old event nor the new. Sometimes you simply cannot change the time of an event no matter what you do.

Usability and UI design could really use some work. | Setting an itinerary is an exercise in frustration as destination times refuse to save at least 40% of the time. When they do save, the app decides to change dates on relaunch. Needs work.

4/13 And latest update broke the widgets. Sigh | The design of the app is definitely 5 stars. Where the Tripsy is legging no live updates on flight delays or gate changes, other similar apps provide that info. | Takes so much stress out of traveling, especially with a group. Love this app and wouldn’t want to travel without it. | Tripsy is by far the most advanced and user-friendly travel planner that I've used so far and I do not know how there could be an app better. It also is a Macbook friendly app, which is a HUGE plus. Definitely recommend! | Tipsy has many positive features to organize travel. For the most part I really like the app, but there’s one glaring flaw.
When a 5:30am wake-up time becomes 3:30 am, for no good reason except that Tripsy wants to send “emergency “ notifications on the watch that a gate has been assigned or changed, the missing sleep makes this app so. Not. Worth. It.
I have my watch and phone in sleep mode. Only emergency notifications should come through. But Tripsy manages to get them buzzing me anyway. I don’t know why or how, nor can I find a setting to turn it off. II just know that I’ve lost more than a few nights of good sleep before travel due to this bug.
“Why are you wearing your watch at night?” —> sleep monitoring and afib monitoring. 
An app that is this disrespectful of the importance of sleep doesn’t deserve more than two stars, no matter how good or bad it is otherwise. | I love having all trip details in one place, and it’s made convenient to forward confirmation emails to the app and automatically on my phone calendar.  It would be useful to have a pre trip checklist of things I need to do and a place for a packing list. 

I like having a trip history to refer to later if traveling to the same place again. It would be helpful to have a section to rate the restaurant, museum, etc after to help jog my memory for recommendations or if a restaurant is worth a repeat visit. | As I sit here loading EACH and EVERY RESERVATION by Hand, MANUALLY, I absolutely wonder WHAT exactly, I am paying for????
I Can do this MUCH EASIER in my Calendar, Except for the ""supposed to be"" ease of seeing it all on one page? NOT HAPPENING, YET! 
Certainly there has to be a better way. | I am planning our anniversary trip, and I have to say this app is awesome. It not only allows me to add everything to a quick view schedule, but also allows me to add documents that I normally had to rewrite not notes on other apps. Ir can find your flights, carrier, hotel and resort! All in a nicely laid out interface. I use it on an iPad Mini and it looks awesome. | I love I can organize stuff for myself and collaborate on trips with my wife, and it supports everything. Tours, cruises, restaurants, adding files and photos, everything. And lots of clever features sprinkled throughout. Fantastic app. | I've been using TripIt (Pro) for years, but I've always found its interface cumbersome and confusing. While TripIt's new interface is better, I much prefer Tripsy for all my travel planning and tracking.  

Tripsy's clean visual design is beautiful and efficient. The main screen displays the most essential information for my trip or, when traveling, for the current leg of my journey. Details for any portion of the trip are usually just a click away. Tripsy has all the main features that you'd expect from a travel app, such as multiple ways to gather travel documents into a trip (search email, forward an email, Mac/iOS sharing, etc), integration with device calendars, support for multiple travelers and non-traveling planners, document upload, etc. TripIt still has an edge in integrations with other travel apps or services. I suspect Tripsy will add more partnerships as they grow and develop. If there is something you want or need to do in TripIt, Tripsy has the option to sync from  TripIt automatically. I used this option when I started using Tripsy, which made that initial transition (or even a trial) so much easier because I didn't need to reimport my documents for planned trips. 

Tripsy lost a few points in this review because of a few areas where it took effort to accomplish some tasks. There are some quirks in importing the cruise portion of a trip. Most cruise data was imported without a hitch; however, it didn't grab the departure time for days in port. I tried manually adding the departure times for a day in port, but it was annoyingly complex. I'd open the detail for a particular day, but I needed help figuring out how to add the departure time, or when I did, I could only choose from predetermined times. Eventually, I found that I had to select a predetermined time, save the changes, open the details again, scroll down to the proper date of my trip and then I could finally set the appropriate time. This problem doesn't happen often, but it is currently a pain. 

Overall, though, I love using Tripsy!! It is now my go-to travel app. | It really helps plan trips and only one person needs a subscription for everyone to collaborate in the app for a trip. | overall great program.  needs a slight interface overhaul (each day should be very subtle different color than others to easily differentiate them).  And I would highly recommend a calendar view. | If you have an itinerary already defined, this app may help document it.  But if you're actually planning and exploring options, it will get slow you down and make a mess in your calendar database.  Also, I got billed for a month even though I cancelled quickly. | Here are my issues so far-- 1) Multiple times, the entries I have put in and saved change on their own. Train times, for instance, will modify themselves to whatever they want (right now I have a train entry that leaves at 8:42PM and arrives at 8:42PM, despite putting in the accurate times). It is not a time change issue, either, they're just random times and AM/PM. This is very annoying and I'm about to give up on this tool. 2) We're flying halfway across the world and you have to scroll to see the map entirely, no way to zoom out and show the whole trip on the screen. You can zoom in...but you can't zoom out to show Florida and Australia on the same map screen. 3) I subscribed to a monthly plan and was surprised to have recently been charged for a year's access. It just seems like ""Save"" doesn't mean what you think it does in this app. I was really excited to get organized, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere, like TripIt. | Unable to even put in dated. Date Screen does not scroll to find the correct month. Figures a work around but once I put in the ending date, the program changes the start date so the trip is ony 1 day....unless I set the trip up without dates but it is difficult to add places for the new days. | 如果加上每段行程花费多少钱这个功能就更好了 | Tried to change to this because I was over trip it. Not pulling in the text from the email and when I search for what I need it keeps showing something in the wrong country. No thanks. Making my life harder | This product can do more to help plan for your vacation than the free platforms. Both this company and apple customer service are unwilling to listen and help resolve my issue with this platform. | This is a great travel planner APP. It works very well and is reliable. Their customer service is excellent as well. If you are looking for a travel planner APP with a lifetime purchase, just try this one! | I am offering 4-stars in this review solely based on the apps' potential and the current user interface design friendliness. The apps' current state and functionality is actually about a 2-star. I hope to update this review shortly to full 5-star based on some things getting taken care of.
Easier itinerary control - went to manually add (I didn't have easy access to the email), a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport for an early flight, and I couldn't do that because the app had already defined the trip as Thursday to Tuesday based on the flight, with me trying to add a Wednesday ""activity"". I had to go into the settings for the itinerary and change the beginning date. (A further annoyance, rather than just changing one date, once I set the new start, it also required the ending, rather than keeping it on the same by default. There should be a way when adding an activity to go “outside the dat boundary” and have the app automatically update the overall itinerary timeframe.
Side-note to above… The share-to-Tripsy function in the Hilton app only brought hotel name and phone number, not the booked dates, res# or other actual booking details - another potential fix? I don’t know if that is Tripsy not importing correctly, or Hilton not exporting & sharing properly.
Better functionality required for the planning part of a trip. Right now, this app just kind of “catches” all the emails you forward it (or painfully add in manually). When you think of booking a trip, say a vacation getaway, there are many pieces to it (the very reason for this app). Resort, flights, transport from airport to resort, excursions while there, maybe a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport with park-and-fly arrangements. Not all that stuff is booked at once. So being able to easily add in each aspect that needs to be booked, and then have each of those activity icons color-coded on the itinerary page (ie. Red for needs booking, yellow for booked, green for booked and pre-paid) really is necessary. Being able to manually change the color of each activity icon would be a simple step. More complex would be adding in 2 checkboxes in the activity (or right-click / hold-click pop up menu) to indicate when it is booked and when it is paid. Next level of complexity would be for the app to automatically color code based on the details provided in the activity (company and res # fields filled out automatically determines “booked” status, I’m not sure how it would determine paid).
 
Again, overall I like the direction this app is going, but it really needs these updates to become the true “Go-To Travel Planner”. Currently, it is leagues beyond it’s main competitor. Enough that I subscribed to Pro for a year. But without these necessary changes, that subscription will not get extended. Yes, those changes are that necessary, and without them I will go back to Excel and OneNote to manage all my travel, as the app would be missing the “ease” functionality that it should have vs. a more manual process.
Hopefully the devs read this and put these ideas in place very soon. I am sure they have a “roadmap”, but for true traveler functionality, these need to be inserted in the immediate stages of that roadmap.
Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!!! | Several of my trips that are complete on one device are showing up as one-day trips on days where I don’t have travel planned. For example, if I have a trip planned from 11-17 March, the trip shows up as 25-25 March on other devices and shared links. None of the activities are syncing across devices. Reached out to support several weeks ago but haven’t heard back and the issue still hasn’t been fixed. Just know that paying for the premium features is worth it when it works, but if it stops working you’ll be dealing with awful customer support. I’ve also never been able to get the import function to work. I like the interface though. | 地图可以增加高德和百度吗？以及板块如果可以自定义就好了，比如我，只想用 app 收集餐馆。旁边的证件对我来说没什么用。我相信有这样需求的人也不少。

""Can maps include options for Amap (高德) and Baidu (百度)? Additionally, it would be great if users could customize categories. For example, I might only want to use the app to collect information about restaurants, and licenses nearby are not relevant to me. I believe there are many users with similar needs."" | A great app that keeps all your travel plans in one place. A suggestion - would you please consider adding a feature that allows me to set to-do reminders for my trip? It would would be so helpful to be able to set a reminder then later received a push notification. Thank you!! | I was a long time TripIt user and Tripsy is better in every way imaginable | I had been searching for a good itinerary app ever since Google Trips shut down years ago. Tripsy is the best one I've used since then. The auto-import by email (for flights, hotels, cars etc) works great and has only gotten more reliable over the year I've been using it. The iOS and Mac apps are both super easy to use and visually appealing. | have you considered adding a ""packing list"" feature for our trips? | This is a great app. I have used it on multiple trips and I can’t live without it now. The only thing missing is that I would like a way to keep a packing list with a quantity field. So I can always make sure I have everything ready prior to a trip and before a return. | Sadly, was hoping this would be app that might work to share itinerary with other humans traveling with me without them having to buy. Nope. Also, had to manually enter 4 of 6 flts and 1 hotel. Even when trying to share from hotel app to create event had to manually enter data. All of this would be fine but when share itinerary with others it does not provide any details (times of flights, flt #, resv etc | Just got it and it provides no guidance as to how to use the app, how to upload reservations; adding guests seems impossible.... | This app is pretty good and very helpful. However I wish the native Mac app felt more Mac-like. As it is, it feels very much like a big iPhone app. I was hoping that planning my trip and making adjustments would have been much easier on my Mac, but I feel the UI and workflow is very limited since it feels like it is a scaled up iPhone app that does not adequately take advantage of the Mac. It is very good, but I wish it could better take advantage of what the Mac can allow for productivity! | Good app and looking forward to using it for future trips.  Would greatly appreciate a field for cost/expense.  We like to work withina budget and this would greatly help. | Searching and adding a flight is too clunky, taking too many steps. The whole UI feels huge like the buttons are massive, but it doesn't make it more usable. You can have different dates than your flights and it doesn't auto update the actual trip dates. You can accidentally add the same flight twice. Buttons aren't labeled, making the intended flow unclear. Basically feels like a more manual version of Kayak, since I'm not paying for the pro version so I can't do email sync. | I download Mac App and iPhone app. At first I ran into problem where the trip from Mac app does not sync. I email support and the Co-Founder responded to me and help diagnose the issue really fast. In face I never had this fast response from app developer before. And the step to diagnose and communication this is straightforward and sincere.

Apart from that, the app has intuitive user interface and easy to understand and can sync with multiple devices and with friends whom I shared the trip with. This eliminated the need to manually create initerary, which reduce times and free us to explore the activities instead. | Wowww. What a good travel app. Very easy going and with all the information and set up for the best experience travel management | I decided to try the app out because I'm looking for an app that can handle travel planning and has a nice UI, which this one does. 

However I noticed while creating an account that the form fields aren't labeled correctly so you can't auto-generate a password from Keychain.This is coming from a developer so I know how easy it is to integrate those small security features in form fields. This was the first red flag. 

So I made a temporary password and I thought I'd change it afterwards to a more secure password, but there's no option to change my password in the app? I read the other reviews about the support being non-existent, along with the developer not responding to feedback in the app store reviews makes me not trust the construction of this app, or being able to get basic support if something goes wrong (keep in mind this app has paid features). I just deleted the app after deleting my account. | The interface is beautiful but the actual implementaion is terrible. Tried several times to add an event and itinerary and it never showed up. I might have even duplicated the subscription in trying to fix the issue. My reccomendation is to go with TripIt. Not as pretty but it works. | Pro user here for a few years now. I absolutely love the planning aspect but the number of unresolved bugs is incredibly frustrating. Support is nonexistent, you won’t get an answer for weeks. There are issues with timezones, findings things, flight schedules, sync and many others. Each update breaks something. I am really unhappy at this point and will not renew our subscription next year. | A really solid travel organization app. All the nice features you want. If you travel it’s easily worth the subscription price. | I love this app and use it constantly. It has been a game changer for me. Very much appreciate the regular improvements. | I would have probably signed up for the paid service and enjoyed the app. However, I found a charge on my card via my apple account before ever using the app. Canceled subscription. | I have used this app twice this year - a two week trip to Spain, and a five week road trip of the east coast of the united states.  In both cases, I found myself a slave to the app. The cost of setting up parts of a trip, in terms of effort, was much greater than the benefit I got from it. I put this app in a drawer and only pulled it out occasionally. I am happy to let this infernal subscription expire until I MAYBE want to use it again in two years.

I like the app, kinda. It looked good at first. It is good at organizing itineraries, as long as those itinerary are AirBnB and organized tours and have a rigid order that will NEVER change. Other parts of my travel plan, like mapping, seem forced and clunky. I had to find ways to do these outside this app.

After a while I started treating this app as a wallet that held a collection of ideas. Adding and removing things from the itinerary took WAY too much effort. Items simply didn't like to move.

I guess I am not their target market. It is too much of a marginal benefit for me keep paying for. It would be worth a fixed charge with paid upgrades, but this is in no way such a life-changing app that I want to keep paying and paying for it. A folder with a collection of links and copies of my reservations works just as well.

Subscription cancelled. | It does not sync with phone and laptop and my phone is missing trips that i put on my laptop!
PLEASE FIX BECAUSE I LOVE THIS APP IF IT WOULD SIMPLY JUST DO THAT | I've been looking for something like Tripsy for a long time.  the closest thing has been tripit but Tripsy seems setup to add the functionality to be the travel suite everyone will use.  It does a pretty good job parsing emails but my AirBB reserveration didnt work. There doesnt seem to be an option for it monitor emails automatically.   It would be nice to be able to drag items from one day/time to another.   The search functionality for new evetns works well.   I love the map feature.  The whole app is worth it for this feature.    Support has been super responsive.  I'm looking forward to growing with them.  Finally theyre doing what no one else could. | I only see, weekly, monthly and yearly as option but not lifetime | Such a great app - but I wish it had 2 small things:

1. The ability to hide flight paths on the map view. I dont want the map to always default to a zoomed out view that doesn’t show many much relevant detail of the stuff I have planned in my actual destination 

2. The ability to add a location to the itinerary on a certain day, without having to assign it a specific time. I.e. “I want to go here on the second day of my trip, but I don’t care specifically

He picked us up at the cruise port and gave us a full private tour around the entire area of Lisbon the castle, the beach icons of the area then we went for a great place for lunch and then he even took us to a winery and then dropped us off at the airport. This was much better than just sitting around doing nothing and it was totally customizable. He communicates very well very friendly great personality highly recommend this tour, it’s a must to do a highlight tour of Lisbon right before coming or going on our cruise ship this | Julia was an absolute amazing tour guy!! 
We enjoyed every moment. She was knowledgeable, fun and delight to be with!!! 
Totally enjoyed it all!! | I use this app for all my trips, personal and work. I type in the place, it gives a history of the location and things to do or restaurants to try. I’ve used it for Berlin, Milan, Key West, Denver and more. | Had a marvelous time.. The hotel accommodation were truly a five star experience.  Upon our arrival the smiles were warm and welcoming. The staff provided us with transportation immediately upon request and breakfast was outstanding. This was our first experience in South East Asia and truly left a lasting impression. | It was a wonderful excursion. We enjoyed all of it. From the mountain views to the monastery it was all an experience. | Great tour to Mt. Rainier. Stopped at a number of sites. Our guide Cory was great! | We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the Vatican with Ella of LivTours!   She was warm, friendly and very knowledgeable with history, art appreciation, and religion (and has a background in archeology!).  If you can afford to go with a small group, do it!  We felt our small group tour was very personal, very pleasant and extremely informative. We saw so many large groups, and we could see the experience was not the same. | This hotel was top of the line for courteous and friendly personnel. The grounds and interior were immaculate and the relaxing atmosphere made the stay outstanding. The choices of food and drinks at the various eateries on site allowed us to enjoy the amenities and not have to leave to locate great dining elsewhere. It was worth every cent we spent. We took home wonderful memories of our experiences here. | I used to love Trip Advisor, but oh how the mighty has fallen.  When I’m trying to find things to do in any given town, sadly I am insistently shown tours and guides, rather than location information.  Tripadvisor is merely a platform for trying to get me to book a tour through them rather than a guide to help me find what I actually wanna see in a particular place.    Their “Things to do” section has become woefully disappointing. On my recent trip to Portugal, Tripadvisor did not really advise me at all. I ended up looking at where the tours took me what they included to figure out exactly where I wanted to go, and then used my Maps program to find out where they were with no help from Tripadvisor. 
Andy The Traveler | i want the old TA BACK!!! | Looking on planning a trip have used this site many times they’re always very good so I’m writing a little review. The past has been pretty good now. We’ll see what happens this next time.,, | Trip Advisor is my favorite way to plan our adventures—in town or away.  

The information is non-biased and accurately describes the various options for dining, lodging and entertainment | I want to especially think the front desk team, Nikhil and Jee for making our stay comfortable and inviting! Nikhil and Jee corrected an issue that we had with our room. This is what makes customer service a satisfying experience. This property used to be a Marriott. Now that it is a Hilton property I’m continually satisfied. | Matteo is a wonderful historian and a great Guide. I recommend using Matteo and
Crown tours to make your stay fun 
and interesting. | Good tour with the right balance of quality and quantity. Could have spent more time at El Escorial but covered most highlights given the time constraints. Valley of the Fallen was a nice side trip that we would not have done on our own. Christiana our guide was excellent. Gave a good balanced commentary about topics that may have political sensitivity. Worth the time and money if you have seen the highlights in Madrid. | Utterly amazed to discover this treasure of artifacts, tables, stools and benches, straight from the wood artisans themselves.  Incredible prices including shipping to the states. I now have 4 beautiful souvenirs from Bali that I will cherish for years. | If you like to cook and learn new cuisines, you’ll love this class.  I’m a chef and enjoyed the experience. It’s a small class (max. 8) and you get a full experience (prepping & cooking) with a market tour of the ingredients you will use during class.  Instructor is friendly, engaging and gives step-by-step guidance in the preparation and cooking of several courses.  You also get a recipe book in print and electronically at the end of class; AND a video of your experience.  Great memory to have.   Transportation: Our driver Dewa was also very nice.  I mentioned something I wanted to find and he took me to a place I could get it. | Trip Advisor is helpful in providing us the best vendors and experiences in our travels based on experience and reviews of others.  TA Takes the unknown out of the selection process.  Thank you. | This was a really chic hotel right in the middle of everything. Young professionals everywhere and excellent accommodations and service. | Not to be missed! It was absolutely wonderful! | This is a great app - other than for whatever reason the people who design the app think it’s a great idea to not let people filter reviews by date (most recent).  I don’t care about reviews that happened two years ago when there are obviously more recent reviews and I’m not interested in reading through 250 reviews to find the most recent.  And by the way, the “last 3 months” doesn’t work.  I tried it and the search result was one review from 11 months ago, even though there was a more recent review.  Please fix this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | This is a great museum for the Merkel, Texas area.  The exhibits include school memorabilia, local police, veterans, and more.  It is well worth the visit!  Just off I-20.  Willie the docent is knowledgeable and friendly with museum visitors. | Just had such an incredible experience skydiving with Skydive Kauai! Dave, the owner, Ben and Taylor, the professional tandem divers, and the pilot were all amazing and so helpful and friendly!! This was in my bucket list and I am so glad I chose to do it in Kauai! The views were spectacular!!! | Delicious food.  Winston was my waiter and he was very helpful with my dinner selection.  Cesar salad was actually a meal as it had grilled chicken in it.  The lasagne was my main entree and I could only eat half!  Would highly recommend this restaurant and Winston! | As a well traveled person, and having once had the function of displaying countries visited on the site, it’s disappointing to see its no longer available. Odd that TA cant incorporate more of Google or at least parts of the world, to allow feedback and reviews.  Over half the towns in Africa I’ve been to, aren’t “allowed” on TA. 
Time to do the full switch to google it appears | The food was not fresh or hot, and they just covered the chicken and brisket with BBQ sauce. The cheddar grits were good. The collard greens were not cooked long enough with no seasoning. | @RACHEDTOHME  #rachedtohme | Combined with a very educational windmill tour, this was a fantastic time for a great price.  Bonus … there was wine. | We had a very nice breakfast at St Regis.  Always delicious food and the service makes the brunch all the better.  Our server was Fahmy and he was very attentive and made sure we had an amazing breakfast.  Definitely recommend | Great coffee, milkshakes and fruit juices. Smoothies to die for! The staff (Antonio, Dominga, Ismael, Olga, Yenny and Neveida) are ALL super attentive to every whim and need! Even brought my 13 year old behind the bar to mix his own special fruit drink! | Sam was a great guide today! She knows all the hot spots to find shark teeth and fossils. Shes very knowledgeable and can tell you what everything is that you find. 

Would highly recommend taking this day tour! | Am amazing, wonderful, relaxing, staff friendly and accommodating that go above and beyond your expectations kind OD resort. Super clean and plenty to drink and eat all day. Food was particularly very good abcs still prepared every. Definitely will be back! | Using Trip Advisor is a great way to ease your mind when traveling. It is user friendly and offers a plethora of options such as food, activities, lodging, etc. when you are traveling. Trip advisor also makes it easy to write reviews and post pictures. Great app to have for any  expert traveller and your beginner traveller. | Leider versuchen wir unser Geld zurück zu erhalten . Da die Leistung nicht erbracht wurde. 
Nun sieht es so aus das wir geblockt werden und auch unsere Bewertung wurde gelöscht . Das ist alles andere als seriös. 
Wir sind wirklich enttäuscht, denn das war ein Geburtstagsgeschenk . | We had Andres as our waiter and he was excellent and served us a wonderful meal at the grill.  
The meal was  very tasty and the flavors were authentic very unique | Waste of time to leave legit reviews. TA likes to remove reviews or reject them. You cannot leave an honest to goodness bad review anymore it seems. No matter how bad a place may seem. | The Parc Bistro on 5th Ave. has a magical feel when you enter and glance down a long neighborhood bar bustling with people and great food. Farò the owner has been in the restaurant business for 30 years I know of. He is warm, friendly and serves wonderful French food. The best dishes and has an extensive wine list. The monthly wine dinners with a winery rep there to discuss their wines are a sellout! Live music weekly and reasonable prices. | Rahul server was excellent…. Very attentive and polite !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great view of burj Khalifa fountains …….,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, great service …. Food very tasty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super nice hostes gave us the best service here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Big selections on the menu food and drinks . Music is amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Friendly environment all over . Feels like home for sure | The app is completely broken, even after updating the app, logging out, logging back in… can’t see any pictures, can’t change my profile picture or see it, can’t share or view itineraries… completely useless now. | Amazing !!!! The Sicilian pie !!!! You won’t be disappointed !! | We stopped at Verona after a yacht trip. Marlon was very attentive and gave excellent recommendations. Everyone was satisfied with their meals. I would recommend. | Never have seen such tight slots.
Our host complained we were not playing much, so we said, your slots are to tight 

Lost a lot of money and made zero

Will visit other Caesars and other states, but not sure I’m gonna be back to Vegas anytime soon | Found the Baixamar seafood restaurant from a recommendation of our hotel desk clerk. The meal was by far the best we experienced on our entire vacation. If you like fresh seafood definitely get the seafood platter for two. Well worth the $ and flavors. | I stay here twice and both times was amazing the guy at the front desk I think his name is siyani but he was the best I’ll stay there a 3 time just off how siyani made me feel | Galo was above and beyond,, dinner was delicious but the service was even better 

We have been coming since 2012 and it’s our favorite spot and experience 

Must try you won’t be sorry ask for Galo | No matter what country I am in any excursion I booked with trip I know it’s a guarantee good time. | I use it to navigate places while on vacation and write reviews as I go. | I always use trip advisor anytime I go somewhere new | The outdoor seating area is by far the best outdoor atmosphere in the Upstate! The indoor area is quirky and unique too and the food is always delicious, the service is consistently great and the menu is more interesting and diverse than most places within hundreds of miles. Whether you’re going for happy hour and appetizers or an amazing lunch or dinner, I can assure you that you won’t be disappointed!",4.80116,340975,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/fc/f8/3a/fcf83ae4-f4a2-734f-4748-8bc91ab28fe1/bdc71823-661d-4099-9b12-8c5f46801ac3_0_APP_IPHONE_55_0.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/06/7e/26/067e2684-ae5a-8ac0-5143-4fb7ce5df0f1/cfb8759e-8f17-4dcd-b3ec-86324915fd0b_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/89/94/91/89949124-e91d-cfb6-d546-ab12d51490f0/ec8b5395-02e8-45b6-8ac4-1de2bccb7db1_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/70/7b/8a/707b8a3b-aa36-25fa-c043-ed01080f1fb2/39a46680-ebfd-4381-b188-31879dfcc15d_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d4/42/8b/d4428b97-c48a-ce5e-9141-27cf686f5016/5586b1f1-aa08-4aa5-a339-b87eec58767e_IOS_5.5_-_Eng__U0028US_U0029_frame_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/96/bb/6e/96bb6e84-909b-a966-abaf-92f0c3e5a521/b537dc6b-c166-4369-aa49-aa6be1ff526d_IOS_5.5_-_Eng__U0028US_U0029_frame_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/10/da/9d/10da9dad-b125-4866-6772-699a0ef9279a/5780628f-b0f8-45a2-85ad-3a4c17d03fce_0_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_0.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/07/29/16/07291634-ec4b-2c75-5184-c34889c5d831/0beea523-0db8-4c83-a836-48b905fab26b_1_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e0/b9/0b/e0b90b2c-d222-b191-8be1-44612e68e911/c0e708ac-f2c8-4827-921c-1c0677b4784b_2_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/59/cd/34/59cd3410-946b-9f87-8c8d-197931af9cc0/e9ce74a7-b61f-4b74-8341-6437ea53549b_3_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/7a/32/67/7a32673d-2c4d-5f86-ac7f-866f6856c22d/e18cb3ac-afd9-42aa-a67c-c429c5e26c05_4_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9f/de/83/9fde83f7-270c-e185-0748-af353df3da62/ad14fa24-c116-42db-8b4f-2f44c6e02dff_0.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11Fourth

It’s very easy to use, and the directions they give are detailed and helpful. 

When I used it for my last event, I wasn’t sure if I was at the correct location, I reached out to their team via WhatsApp  and  they replied back to me in less then two minutes.

I will use this app any time I travel abroad ! | This app has completely changed my stress level when planning a trip. It tells me what to see, how to see it, and allows me to put in places I want to see and it will tell me which day its most convenient. | I’ve used Viator for Paris, Seattle, London, Dublin, Boston and more! It’s my GO-TO travel app when I don’t want to miss a thing!!! | It’s about the feeling of belonging. Knowing it’s all going to be ok once you check in. 
The smiles of the personnel, the ambiance, the environment. 
Everything is so cool! | Great app for planning the trip without missing the most important sights and ajustable to your travel length | I love this app.  It truly makes planning a visit to a city EASY!!!  I love how it builds the itinerary based on your timeframe.  Some things i wills look to see as enhancements:
1.  Allow download of plans to be used offline
2.  Allow user to default start times for specific itinerary items
3.  Allow users to select method of going from one point to another (eg. allow me to self walk if i won’t want public transportation)

App is a must have!!!! | I like my privacy thru require you to be tracked through Facebook google and others not just use while using the app  I unstalled fast! | Needs a blurb about each city before the onslaught of tours. I need some insider information - the essentials - about the city, history, weather, geography, best time to go, events, landmarks. I want to read some information before diving into tours. I know they need to monetize the app, but it feels like advertising. | This app can’t seems to find almost any hotels, either by name or by address. | Wish you could add “breaks” in the app like you can on the website also Need to be able to add different hotels on the same itinerary other than that- Make’s planning multi day trips so easy when you have a lot you need to get in and can’t waste time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank you. | It’s a good apps for the trips. I suggest to add direct links to the monuments | We have used this app on several trips in the past couple years.  It is wonderful!!  With the maps, day by day itineraries, and suggestions, we’ve been able to navigate our way through London, Athens, Paris, and now we’re using it to help plan our trip to Rome!  It’s a lifesaver!! | Spinning wheel forever. Worst app in the age of chatgpt | I’ve been using the app for 10 years, I travel A LOT, I adjust times, dates and activities and attractions w easy. Usually I am the lead in my groups and people are always so impressed and satisfied. I set activities that are near eachother for same day, usually hitting one region or area per day. Very seldeom I use public transport, usually all by foot and the map option allows me to plan accordingly. | I have used it all over the world, very good and helpful | The program works well, but I was unable to figure out how to list more than one hotel and use the app to plot which sites to see from each hotel site. Also 10 days is maximum. Limited in allowing you to travel between different cities on the same trip. Nice listings of attractions close to each other and offers a variety of itineraries to adapt to your plans. | Very versatile, flexible, you just choose a city and you have many options to plan accordingly. | Joan did a spectacular tour. His knowledge and perspective of both the city’s history and local color made Barcelona come alive. I definitely recommend this tour and Joan. 25 stars! | That’s the review.. just got a blanked out screen on iPhone. Tried on android the same.. bummer | This app constantly forces you back to the beginning. You’re on day one, every time you go into it you going to go through plan your trip, your plans and then sometimes it’s not your plans but the generic guide they give you constantly reloading.  In your travels this can get really expensive. Also there used to be an offline downloadable map which was amazing. | This app is amazing and it’s a staple for all of my trips. One problem is adding a stop the app doesn’t recognize. I wish we could add an address if the app doesn’t recognize it as a destination. | Freezes constantly. Every few seconds! | I consistently recommend this app to anyone I meet that tells me they are traveling to a new city! It’s incredibly easy to use and flexible. You are sure to optimize your time using it to see top attractions anywhere in the world! | I was thrilled to find this helpful site and even happier with the intuitive way it works.  I have reworked our week in London a couple times and it was easy peesy!  😊 | After long hours of working on my itinerary, I then tried to download and print.   Though it said it had emailed the itinerary to my email address, it never did.   There is no print option, when you select print it just says it emailed it.    Not what I had hoped for. | I’ve used this all over the world, whether on vacation or a short business trip. Best way to be efficient and knowledgeable! | What a great place to start your planning for any trip. Offers such a variety of options and how to pace yourself. | I like the concept, but to get started it’s not user friendly. One I remember how to input everything it’s smoother | One of my favorite travel apps! | The best app ever.  It help me travelled around the world.  Everyone should have it | Truly a phenomenal idea and an amazing app. Thanks to the team. Great job. | I rate this the BEST guide to plan for visits to  any city ! It is very time- saving to visitors! | This | Friendly use | I used it in Italy, New Orleans, San Francisco and more.  It’s awesome.  Saw so much more than I would have been able to with out its direction.  Signed up for tours I never would have known about.  Fabulous! | I have used this program several son the last couple of years.  I love its ability suggest itineraries to Mach the available to see the sites | Fantastic app and I’ve used it to organize and maximize many trips regardless of how long my visit will be! | Nice concept but you need to do a lot of work on this app or website. Can not edit your travel itinerary or move your plans from one day to another.
Can not add “things to do” from the tab into the itinerary, sends you to another site. | this app is so useful and helps so much when seeing a new place especially when it gives you a map overview of all the attractions | Love this app for city planning. | I have been looking for an app to track my trips and add places that I would like to go. This app gives me ideas by setting up itineraries for me and allows me to adjust them to fit my needs. One thing that I would like to see is the ability to change the actual times. We made reservations for dinner and I may I am not able to change the time for that particular item without adjusting the length of the time I’m at other places. | I’m just gonna say it—the interface is kind of trash! There’s a lot of functions that would be nice, convenient, and rational to have that aren’t there, and if they ARE there, they’re not intuitive to find at all. It also gives me clunky mapquest vibes. 
But—if you like trip planning, it definitely gives you that satisfied feeling once you have your itinerary all filled out. Also, after seeing the website, the app looks a lot better. Happy traveling! | This app has been a godsend for our large family, as we have been traveling in Europe! It is a first rate idea generator, even suggesting a sensible itinerary. Not only that, but when we had difficulty with tickets from a vendor the app listed, the Cisit a City customer service stepped up to get us a refund. Exceeded my expectations! | I love looking at Visit-a-City to identify the sites in a particular location. And I have been able to find some great tours and activities to book. | We use visitacity to map out our trips.  It p provides  an easy to follow itinerary.  If you are a planner, this is the App for you. You will not be disappointed. | I love this app!I have used it for international multi country trips as well as trips within the USA. You put in the where and when and your planning is almost done for you!  I would highly recommend this app for anyone traveling whether you have kids, want to relax or go and see everything! | I admit I found it much easier to use website to plan the trip then the app.  I tried tons of travel planners and this is the best site.  Once you have the plan done, you can share it or for me being old school, I printed it for a hard copy.  There are areas it can improve on, but compared to other apps, this easy.

I had to email them with a technical support and they were awesome.  Download it and give it a try, but remember the website is easier to do the initial plan.  5 stars me is odd, but this app deserves it. | This app is awesome!

Unfortunately it would never connect and kept giving me the connecting circle of death that didn’t go anywhere. I contacted tech support and am still awaiting a response 4 weeks now and counting. | I packed everything more quickly than usual and I didn’t forget anything. Will keep using it | I travel a few times per year so I am not a huge traveler. But I did not find this app user friendly. Maybe it just didn’t suit my needs but I’m not impressed. | It has lists that auto populate based on the length of your stay, weather, etc but I really want to just attach my own things in addition, reservations, activities, restaurants. Maybe I just don’t understand this app. And it has nothing to explain it | Not $3, but $3 a month. Super annoying setup where you can just start making a list, you have to put in dates, destinations, and type of trip. I’m looking for a packing list app that lets me input my own lists. Keep it simple. | I’ve been using this app for many years and I’ve been very happy. I only use it once or twice a year and it was free before. I don’t mind paying to keep the app but now it’s wanting me to pay $20 a year. I would be happy to pay $20 just to have the app forever but there’s no way I’m going to pay that every year.I’m very disappointed because I really liked this app | This app told me to bring a scarf to Disneyland this weekend. It’s not going to be cold enough. You need to change your app and only tell people to bring a scarf when it’s below freezing. | Very basic packing list. It is good to include power adapters, health insurance card, but neglects things like an umbrella, hat and jacket and small scissors. Also …for a long trip it suggested 15 shirts …which is ridiculous. I take no more than 5 shirts even if going for months. Clothes can be washed. 
I don’t see any reason to pay for this app. It’s ok I suppose if you don’t already have a packing list of your own. There are many better packing lists for free on websites. | The way the ads appear and they way the interact (close ads overlap, etc), the app is unusable. | Used to be great. Now it’s just ads. How can an app about packing have so many ads? It’s insane. They also deleted all my old packing lists, so I can’t even reference those. Time to find another app. | I downloaded it and immediately opening the app my phone was overloaded with ads inside the app. Absolutely do not like this app at all | I recommend this app to everyone. I particularly hate packing because it’s so stressful, but the customized activity lists make packing a breeze. | Don’t like being forced to watch an ad to use the app | If dobt get premium sibscriptions doesnt seem like you can do much | Update: After using this for a weekend trip, this may not be the app for me. It is extremely frustrating that every time I open the app, it prompts me for an update. However, the App Store does not have an update.

But then all my lists keep getting put out of alphabetical order. This is annoying to find to check out and try to pack. Then items will be added to a person when creating a trip and it is not on the list that I have so where did it come from?

I will be looking for about her app.

———————————————

I am searching for a good packing list. While this one is okay, it is frustrating. I have spent all day trying to load it up with our trips and it is just not user friendly. It is constantly putting my lists out of alphabetical order. So for me to sort it manually within each list and trip is just annoying. I also wish that I could easily remove a person from a trip and changing from multi-trip to single when duplicating a trip. | Updating my review because now there’s offline mode. Great app! | This app makes it so easy to put together a list for packing. As someone who struggles to stay organized, this app helps so much with providing suggested items per planned activity. SO much better than trying to make sure I think of everything on my own. I undoubtedly will either forget something or overpack planning it on my own. | This app is extremely helpful. It customizes your packing lists for the weather at your destination (and can update this). It also customizes it for your planned activities and duration of stay. It is a great way to make sure that you have what you need and don’t forget anything. it is by far the best list of this sort that I have encountered. The only small improvement I might suggest is for long trips on which you will be washing every few days, it would be helpful if you could specify the number of days between each washing so that the app knew what to recommend for packing. Nevertheless, it does a great job. | I’ve never used another tool, but this one has everything I need — pre-built lists, weather forecast and the ability to customize. Love it! | I have used Packr on iPhone and iPad for years. I did not realize there was a Mac app until recently so I downloaded it.

I have tried different packing list apps and packing list methods over the years including a spreadsheet, Notes, a Word document, and other packing list apps. I even tried Macsparky's Reminders packing list idea. I always come back to Packr. Why have I tried other apps if I like Packr? Because I like to try new apps! But I will not stray again. Packr just works for me. I ike that I can make different lists for different needs for different trips and reuse them over and over. 

Thank you for a great app! | I created my trip, selected the categories and when I submitted to continue, it gave me the option to either pay $3/mo or $20/yr for premium or watch an ad. I opted for the ad, because I hadn’t gotten far enough into the app to know if I like it. The full screen, 10-second ad counted down but then it was done, the ad wouldn’t close! The little “x” was there in the top right corner but it didn’t work. I closed and relaunched the app twice, re-created the trip (because it wasn’t saved), and the same thing happened. I could have written out my entire packing list on paper in the time I wasted trying to make this app work. So disappointed. | This app is great, and it just keeps getting better. It works wonderful for multi city vacations or just quick getaways. One of my favorite features is saving customizable list. This allows me to have specialists for each of my trip needs, from camping in the mountains to water sports at the lake. Plus I can add my personalized photo to the top of the trip. | Used to be able to create a new default list with icons to choose.  Not saving new lists or adding an icon.  I thought you could add more than one trip photo. Can't find information on a huge venue tourist site in a city. | I like the concept of Packr but one major flaw. I want it to automatically sync between my iPad and my iPhone. All my other apps automatically sync (icloud) but it appears this has to be manually synced every time you make a change. Very inefficient. | I wanted to try out the app to see how it worked. No matter what activity I chose it pushed the buy-pro. I deleted the app. If you can’t give it a test run to see how you like it, I’ll try another app | My devices have separate apps and don’t load the same trips. It would be nice if they would sync and have the same trips. Is there a profile? Not even seeing a way to log in. | Been a premium user for a while. Really wanted to love it because I travel for work a ton and need customized packing lists. This app has so many bugs and I am tired of items not showing up in lists I create, or reverting back to old lists after being updated. The idea is great but the execution is just not there. | Use basically every trip | Very basic app for the price | After creating your trip, you’re met with a full screen advertisement that can’t be closed even after the allotted time. The X button is unresponsive. | I purchased Packr Premium several years ago and absolutely love it. I had a problem when I deleted this app off of my iPad and thought I had lost all my lists, but the developer fixed it within a day. I use this app for all of my trips because I love the weather forecasts which help me know how to pack. I also have saved customized packing list for different activities like backpacking or international travel. I have recommended this app to several travel buddies who were green with envy when they saw all it could do. If you travel, it’s worth every penny. | I was packing for Coachella and this made my life so much easier because I was dealing with a health problem that made me very uncomfortable and not feel like myself. A month or so in advance, I was brainstorming things I wanted to pack and had come up with a preliminary list. Then as I was packing for the few days before leaving for the trip, I was adding as I went. Finally I finished everything on my list and I didn’t know what else to bring. I had to sleep and then leave in 6 hours lol. It was great!! I didn’t forget anything. 

I really like the layout of this app. Sometimes it can get confusing with lists and removing stuff in lists it asks you if you want it removed forever, i just ignore them and it seems to work out fine since i dont really need to pack for trips that frequently. It works well for when you want an app that’s not your Notes or Reminders app | This app is my CONSTANT GO TO to help me with my business and pleasure travels!
THANK YOU for being such an AWESOME APP!!!!!!!! | I’ve several other packing list apps and have settled on Packr. It just does packing lists and does it really well. I highly recommend it. Also their tech support is awesome. | Can’t get passed the first add. The X is so far off the edge you can’t close the add. 
USELESS GARBAGE. | You can’t get to the packing list.  Watch an ad that allows you to advance but the button to advance to the list page doesn’t work.  Honestly, it’s an app that tells you how many pairs of socks you should bring on a 3 day trip, why the ads?  Delete immediately. | it crashes on my macbook. too bad. I had used in the past | I am a very heavy packer. Though I’m still this way, this app has helped me improve greatly. It’s very cool how it tells you the number of things to bring like socks, and shirts, gives you the ability to add things and tailors needs to the weather forecast…which it also has. It’s been 5-Starts since I bought it and has continued to be with updated and new features added | Do not download. Interface commonly crashes and though it is ad centric, the ads are coded in such a way as not to allow access through once viewed. Lists aren’t generated. | Do not have what I need | It might just be me. I love the app, but I’m not sure how I see the other family members I added. How do I see the list for my son? | This app thinks of everything. You tell it where you’re going and for how long and it gives you the most thoughtful packing list ever. It thinks of every single thing you may need for your trip! I highly recommend it!! | The new version makes you pay to even make a list anymore. The old didn’t. BAD. Try Packing List: Trip Planner instead. | Greatest app of all humanity for packing! | I can’t print my list.  The option is there, but it closes the app and doesn’t bring up a list. This doesn’t help me. If you want to carry your phone while you pack, this may be fine. | App crashed and I lost my $4.99 for the upgrade to premium. | I use this app for every trip I take!   Perfectly organized and easy to use!   The only reason I gave four stars is because the local  attractions are not so local!   A trip to the Bahamas brings me activities to do near Greece! | Premium in app purchase doesn’t share with family, I bought it and thought my wife could share it with 1 purchase. Not fair and the sharing feature isn’t explained well. | I love this app for packing lists. I have used TripIt for a couple years for keeping track of travel info. This works well with that to help me prep and pack for those trips. I’m he suggested lists consider weather and what I will be doing (after I make selections) to make the list very practical. I can also add my own notes and modify the list as I see fit. I also love the ability to share a list. I’m his has been helpful for my husband and me as we can just check that app and make updates (instead of assuming the other grabbed it or grabbing double.)

An essential tool for global expats, digital nomads, permanent residents, dual residents, overseas homeowners, and frequent travellers.

AUTO TRIP RECORDING
With geolocation tracking, Flamingo automatically determines if you have left your residence country or state and accurately records your trip details so that you don’t have to. Keep tabs on the countries and states you’ve visited and how many days you spent there.

SCHENGEN AREA CALCULATOR
If you frequently travel to the EU Schengen Travel Area as a non-resident, it can be a hassle to keep up with the 90 in 180 days rule. Flamingo counts how many combined days you’ve already spent in Schengen countries and how many more you have left in the 180-day period. If you’re already located in the EU as a non-resident, Flamingo tells you the date when you have to leave to avoid overstaying.
The built-in calculator helps you determine not only the earliest date you can travel to the EU for your desired number of days, but also for how many days you can stay if you arrive on your desired date.

VISA-FREE STAY
Based on your citizenship, Flamingo automatically identifies to which countries you need a visa, e-visa, or visa on arrival and where you can travel absolutely visa-free.
Coming soon: Flamingo will also tell you how long you can stay in each country visa-free, monitor your duration of stay and alert you when you’ll be close to overstaying.

RESIDENCE STATUS FOR COUNTRIES & US STATES
Flamingo helps you determine your physical presence for domicile and residency by automatically recording and counting how many days you spend there.
*Especially useful for Statutory Residence Test for UK expats and Substantial and Physical Presence Tests for US expats and permanent residents.

EXPORT REPORTS
You can download a customizable CSV report with your travel details with the tap of a button. Share it with authorities and lawyers in seconds or keep it for your own travel records. 

COMPLETE PRIVACY
Your travel, residency, and visa data is stored locally only on your device. We do not collect, nor store, your information on our servers. 
*With Flamingo PRO you can sync your data via iCloud across all your devices.

***Flamingo tracking and counting are created for information purposes only. Always consult with your legal advisor about specific requirements for your residency and visa status.

Would now need to go back and update the timeline manually. 

The core value proposition of the app doesn’t work. | We investigated numerous apps for tracking travel and residency, and one app clearly stood out. We have a complex situation involving time spent in numerous countries and several US states. This app's intuitive design simplifies what could be a complex and distracting tracking process—it has been a big stress reducer, to say the least. But what truly impressed us was the level of customer support. I had a few unique scenarios I wanted to clarify, and after reaching out, I received prompt, detailed, and supportive responses. It is unusual to find a blend of well-designed software and exceptional support. I confidently recommend this app to anyone in need of managing their travel and residency details. It's an excellent tool, supported by a dedicated, thoughtful, and caring team. | I got this app to track my location for tax purposes. We have homes in both Florida and Minnesota. We just became FL residents. I wanted to be able to easily prove I was out of MN 183 days. I just checked the app and after only 33 days it is totally wrong. I was in FL 29 days and in MN for 4. It says I was 7 nights in and 26 nights out of my state of residency. I’m so disappointed as I trusted this app would do what it’s supposed to do. Now I don’t have the easy, accurate records to prove my residency for 2024. It’s too late to start another residency tracking app for this year. What a waste of money. So glad I only paid for a month and not a whole year. | Finally what I was looking for! Due to my work, I go from state to state throughout the year and come tax season it’s hard for me to figure out in what state I should file my taxes. With this app, the headache is gone as it counts my days automatically. I can also easily put in my previous trips to count the times I traveled before I installed the app. I also like the design and how intuitive it is.",4.67105,76,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2b/13/df/2b13df17-4004-d526-45ae-ef0abb330753/1d469fef-4019-402a-81f3-94eb0663f7d8_w_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ba/f1/f9/baf1f9e6-a03c-30ad-0253-43dea720aa3c/e447ab5d-85f6-461a-b93b-249e9699b8e3_w_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6f/87/4a/6f874aba-0edf-3598-95d8-8369f9c4c181/787418a7-c67e-4a02-86ff-bba0d28cc987_w_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/72/48/2e/72482e51-2dc1-3c5a-e686-f4a0079e3094/8d66813e-a216-49b4-b197-3e1b847e7866_w_4jpg.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f0/e6/44/f0e6444f-7816-261c-6f76-2e0d77a2caac/678a3389-e43d-4d70-a9b3-69c5c6406927_w_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a8/58/e4/a858e4d8-d590-7bbc-536a-1404492e8e49/43949152-4ac9-4c0d-9b5b-f919420063f7_w_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/af/2a/5faf2ade-fdab-bd39-30cc-37a64c34f328/f00ad6bf-f850-4d7a-8a36-ad743ce24d41_w_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3c/20/9e/3c209ec6-bc6e-85f9-9761-c93d4650f42e/1f4e344f-4ffe-448a-a1ac-6d4089d5b1ff_w_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5a/01/6a/5a016a6f-1c92-637b-b18a-9b6475d7af16/25b8fba8-9e4e-4e9e-b140-9c76bff55235_w_10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I even typed “store” into the search bar, but it just said “no results”.  Went with another app called TripIt.  Much better. | This app seems abandoned. Last update was a year ago. Most contents in the app just wouldn’t load. Nearly unusable. | Planning a trip to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown Ky and the Creation Museum in Petersburg Ky.  Neither available. 

So not very helpful for us trying to plan a vacation. Will try again someday. | I used this app in Paris, great. However, when I tried to use it in Portland ME, I could not find Portland Head Light, one of the oldest lighthouses in America, commissioned in 1791 by George Washington. There is no way to add manually. We can only add what’s already there. Need to update please. | Very short overview.   Limited content. | If you’re into 70%+ of their posts being TikTok videos that they share, along with nondescript titles or descriptions, cool I guess. But that’s literally all it is, along with the thumbnails/ previews all being broken. 
Trash. | It won’t let me change “searching in xx” if I try to switch the card pulls up from bottom of screen then immediately goes back down. Unable to swap and use a big portion of the app’s functionality. | It has a really nice interface, easy information at a glance! It’s really helpful and I can see myself using it in the future. It doesn’t have Istanbul, which is my upcoming trip, though. Would be nice! Thanks, lots of potential! | It seemed easy at first. I want to have hotels, museums and restaurants in my itinerary. The app couldn’t locate one restaurant. Also, I set up an itinerary and the app lost all the information so I would have to start over. | Like the idea. Unfortunately it is Very buggy. I can’t search what I want. And the design is not very intuitive | Don’t bother, this app is designed to serve ads and collect personal info in exchange for doing basic google searches. | Great idea and app, has great potential if the searches were more up to date | Literally just an app for bookmarking travel spots.  Obvious features that would make it far more useful such as notes, personal ratings, and being able to jointly share itineraries are missing. | I cannot recommend this app. The last update wiped my itinerary! Now I’m hoping support fixes it before I need to rebuild it all. 

I feel dumb for not taking screenshots of each day. But I liked the flexibility of changing my plans in here. | No se cómo manejar bien el app, para mi falta información de su manejo. | This app has no original content.   It just refers you to other articles and links filled with advertisements.   Stick with apple guides if you’re looking for crisp, well curated guides | Nothing original about this and they post terrible content all on Instagram. They just use other people’s work! | This app has a lot of good content, but the amount of notifications this app spams you with is absolutely insane. I heard a lot of good things about this app, so I just downloaded it the other day and I’ve been immediately bombarded with 30+ notifications per day. I just looked to see if there was a way to personalize what kind/how many notifications you get and there doesn’t appear to be any options for it. It’s either you get spammed with notifications all day, or you don’t get any at all. Or you just deselect a bunch of things that you’re interested in, but that totally defeats the purpose of the app. I don’t think I’ve ever left a negative review on here before, but I expected much better from such a highly regarded app. | best travel Apps EVER!!! | I couldn’t find anything, and it was much easier to just google locations. The app was much too complicated for my liking. | All this App does is refer you to TicToc or Instagram which I have no interest in adding to my phone. Very little original content. | Almost no useful info for places | Gracias | Kind of pointless. Miss Google Trips. | Too many error messages. Can’t even make a profile to start. App is updated. Just a lousy app | we can for our next one in Fall? | I love love love this app. I even use it when not traveling just to daydream and plan for the future. Love it! | Love it. Best place to get travel inspiration ideas. | Easy to use for travel plans and has lots of good information! | The perfect pocket guidebook for all of my travel needs! Helps feed my wanderlust, plan my upcoming trips and guides me while I’m in my destinations traveling! The content seems to be endless and always updating with the most recent things I should know about where I’m going! ♥️♥️♥️ | Planning a trip to Iceland and it was so helpful.  All the great places to stay and so informative to plan just about everything.    Such a genius idea creating this app.     Thanks Trip Scout | Very helpful | Literally opened the app to use it for the first time and nearly panicked thinking I got my own dates wrong. Calendar isn’t synced, sept is really October’s calendar for example. Event locations not updated to show new location addresses… not really impressed. 

I’ll stick with my old school way of planning. | These are tons of experienced travelers. They don’t take you to the top rated five star restaurant everyone is talking about... they take you to the hole in the wall, home cooked meal that seats a total of 7 people. And the meal is better than you’ve ever tasted. I have used this app from Cairo to Croatia to Iceland and it has saved me so much time on trying to find the interesting, desolate places! | Although Covid has put a damper on our travel this past year, we are ready to get back on the horse and continue seeing the wonders of the world.  We used TripScout exclusively to plan our last trip to Europe and it made our planning and executing seamless and informative.  Their network of travel experts, and travelers input makes it an extremely useful tool both for the novice traveler and nomads like my wife and I….on the road again yada,yada,yada | Amazing app. Need an android version for my friends. | I love how tailored everything on Trip Scout is for my travel plans! I have all the best recommendations and tips for a great vacation right in this app! | By far the most diverse yet organized platform out there for anyone planning to travel, or who travels frequently!! A must have app! | Love this app. Easy to use. Great for trip planning and inspiration. | Huge fan of this app and loving the upgrades!  I recommend this app to all of my traveler friends - backpackers, luxury vacation, solo travelers, family travel, etc - because it is so easy to navigate and sort through based on your own specific travel profile and what fits you as you plan your trip.  When I’m not able to get away, I love reading articles on TripScout’s app and dreaming about future travel! | Incredibly easy to use and packed full of worthy trip planning information. Tripscout offers multiple perspectives on travel and helps plan my dining, lodging and short term excursions given the content is so up to date. It’s also an enjoyable escape where I can take a few minutes and feel inspired about my next trip. | It’s amazing so helpful and perfect ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ | Absolutely love using this app. Travel is much easier and far more interesting when using Tripscout to plan and execute trips.

Problems occurred with syncing between devices and Rob quickly replied with suggestions on how to fix. Rare that tech folks can respond quickly and effectively. Kudos to all. | Inroute is the easiest to use and best navigation app that I have tried . | The only problem I have with this app is when I’m looking for smaller roads to make a waypoint, I enlarge them to try to see what number of road it is and there is no label on the road. I’m doing this on a iPhone. | I love this app! I only discovered it recently because it was rated as great for car play, but it has quickly become essential for me to plan my routes based on the elevation chart. Living near the Rocky Mountains, elevation is often a key factor in route planning. | All works well just wish the map didn’t lag when searching and creating waypoints | There needs to be a way to change the numbers of points entered so that you can put them in order or can add a point that you see is needed later into the middle of the line somewhere and get it in the right order. Also when you are using, the route developed, it would be more desirable if the turns were referenced by road numbers rather than by street names because most of these people using inRoute are using it for commercial purposes and we use road numbers rather than street names. Desperately need the road number as the points description. The local street name does not help a person who is not from that area. The road number is the descriptor that we need. When the points have been positioned where they need to be, I do wish that the line and route would follow the pointsexactly by their number order and not try to route along the shortest route as the crow flies. We put in a specific order for a reason. Permits require exact, turning points and roots of travel. | I have multiple businesses and I use this routing app for multiple purposes I use it for routing out routes for showings, routing out routes to drive on trips. It just really comes in handy it’s worth every penny and it’s very very user-friendly. | I’ve tried at least half a dozen apps and this is the best for our travel. I can adjust the way points according to my mileage and easily find the best route. It’s not the most user friendly app but they are constantly improving | I’ve tried most of them and this is the best gps for me. I make multiple stops a day at regular addresses. This platform provides an excellent solution to gps guidance. It Integrates, imports , and optimizes routes in a not too complex way. I am very thankful for this app. | Can’t see all the road numbers. Tried everything and still nothing. Not very impressed with the app. | The app has the most flexibility in finding stuff every x miles. It is worth reading the tutorial to get the most out of it. | I find some of the user flow confusing in this app. I’m planning an 18 day trip. Its helped order my way points. It’s confusing why every way point can be a start or end stop as well. That’s un-necessarily complex UX. The segments don’t display time. 

In the list view (which is nice) it shows distance and time since origin - I see no immediate value in this. 

What I want is how long is the drive. While it alternates from stops to layovers, there does seem to be a fair amount of confusing / unnecessary text. For example “next step”
Is redundant as the next line has the step name. This makes the readability easier rather than burying these details. Would love for stops to include URLs to camp sites (I can add them). 

Happy to chat more if the devs are around. | Usability must be improved. There is no posted speed limit displayed, it does not seem to understand traffic problems ahead, you start on your smartphone and then on your RV display it says you have to end navigation and start again, and if you start any other app you have to start from scratch. Not what you’d expect for what you pay. | Not sure if I was maybe looking to have the ap do more than it is set up for, but I found this ap to not be very user friendly. It does not seem to give many options past just the mapped route. I couldn’t figure out how to even get roadside information like RV Parks, rest stops, fuel stations, etc. | Wished it had exit numbers | I can’t figure out how to turn toll roads off. | Purchased pro version of app for RV. I could not enter any specifications. App continues to ask to upgrade to pro version. Paid the monthly and cancelled.
Update:  went through the app restore process previous purchase and upgrade to no avail several times. | I work in the oversize, super load industry. Pretty much everybody I know uses this app because it is the best one for what we do. I have had many conversations with the people at inRoute, and they have made many, if not all of the changes I recommended to improve it. They listen. The one thing that still stands out as an annoyance is when you create a route, and then close the app. When you reopen the app and the route you created, it often tries to reroute you a different way than what you had chosen, or tries to get you to loop around or make u-turns. On some roads you have to figure out how to force the app to go the route that you want. 
Now, inRoute will tell you that you have to change your settings when you create the route because it will use current Apple Maps information and reroute you if it thinks it needs to or if you chose the wrong transportation method. This should not happen, but it does quite frequently. When a route is created, it needs to stay that way, under all circumstances. If there is a new road closure or detour along the route you created then they should simply have a pop-up window that tells you what the issue is instead of rerouting you automatically. The user should have the option to reroute, not Apple Maps or the inRoute app by default. Specifically, in my industry, we follow permitted routes. These routes are already determined by DOT to be safe, open, and available to us. And when I share this route with other users in my industry and they open up the app even when they select the “adjust” setting when trying to open it, the route still changes the route on us. This is a big glitch because I have had coworkers running with other oversize crews get on the wrong road because of the app making changes by itself. Yes, they should know the route or be able to read a permit, but the app should not change the route - no matter what! This is a big issue in the oversize industry. 
So, lastly, let me just say inRoute needs to stop this from happening and allow the user to make the changes if necessary, based on what I suggested above, that perhaps a pop-up window would come up and give the app user the opportunity to change the route, if necessary. The app should not do this automatically. It happens more often than you know. I’ve tried to get inRoute to change this before and they always tell me that when you’re sharing it, the other person needs to have the same settings. Well, my answer to that is when they download the map after I’ve shared it there is a selection that they can say “adjust”, and it will adjust the settings on their app to match the settings that the route was created with. And they still have issues. Other than this, I think it’s a great app. I’ve used it for nearly 3 years and they have made many improvements several of which I have suggested because of the industry I’m in.
It’s still the best app out there for planning a route, especially multi-state routes. | Needs to speed the directions while on a phone call instead of just beep. | The GPS map doesn’t spin around and stays North to South no matter what direction you’re driving and makes directions very difficult. | Rated four star because gps or maps need to be updated and the buttons could be a more user friendly. | Only 4 because of Apple Maps. Would be great if I could highlight railroad tracks and crossings when I ask for them. This app is used by a lot of truck drivers who move oversized loads. More information is better. Thank you. | This is my first time writing a review for an app. I enjoy using it as it helps me plan my trip before I leave. I gave it four stars simply because I couldn't find good sound quality, and the road highlights on the map are quite thick when zoomed out. | Worked great until the update. Now it won’t even open. Have uninstalled, reinstalled, restated phone, and everything else I can think of. Emailed company and no response. Would like to receive the service I pay for. | Need to include exit numbers. Also, a possible way to check bridge height while in hybrid mode. Other than that love using the app. Thank You. | I am a Road Captain for our local chapter here in Central Texas. I use this app all the time creating routes. 
My problem is that I can only use this app on my work phone, which is an iPhone. My personal phone is not. I would love to use this on another platform, and so would so many other users. 
Is there a plan to provide this free or paid service to Android users? | This app helps me see exactly how far I have between stops.. | This app is great for drivers like myself that haul tall wide heavy and long 
Very handy , worth every penny | Necesito que sea como antes que la aplicación me deba la oportunidad de enviar las confirmaciones | This could be the perfect app.  
I use this more then Apple map, Google map and Waze.   

InRoute is still much better then the others mentioned here for a family trip or simple deliveries. I love the weather updates and road closure updates as well as toll information, for all this,  I give 5 stars. 

Features I’d like to see added are speed limit notifications while using the app, satellite street view with split screen for over all route view while entering the desired route, these additions would increase the value of InRoute and the need for other apps to create a route in InRoute wouldn’t be needed.  

4 star for my type of work due to other apps needed to run at the same time for all information mentioned above. | Great does everything I need it to thanks for making it | I’ve tried the application for 2 days and found it is useless app. 
I removed my trail subscription , deactivated the service and uninstalled the app. 
Today I noticed that they charged my account for $4.31 while I’m not using your service at all. 
Be careful, don’t try the app until further update in this review.

Update:
The customer service didn't reply.
I was not able to get my money back.
Stay away and don't be fooled by the reviews that seems NOT to be true. | If you like driving past way points multiple times, flipping countless u turns, and backtracking half the time then this is the app for you. If you’re trying to be efficient in your route pass up on this app. But if you like driving around just to waste time then maybe give it a try. | I use this app everyday creating my daily lawn routes. Has saved me a lot of money and most importantly time. | I love the app but I’d like to see exit numbers and highway numbers when I zoom in on an exit to drop a pin. Zooming in reviews the local names of the roads but not the road number. If you could add these it would be closer to perfect. WE NEED EXIT NUMBERS!!! | Dependable - Accurate - User Friendly - Great planning tool | Trying this on my latest RV trip. Overall it’s OK. Could be a lot easier to customize routes but offset by the ability to save specific routes once customized. 

Major issues: 
1. No speed limit information - which is a major flaw
2. No off line maps.

Minor issues
1. User interface is one of the worst. Hard to find specific actions you want - including just saving routes.
2. Really not good for simply monitoring your driving. Really requires a destination to be useful. | Won’t plan route not good for delivery driver if you need to prioritize deliveries | Great app | The app keeps reversing the order of my stops on my route, no matter how many times I change it and/or save it. I’m planning a roughly circular route going south to west to north to east, the app keeps changing it to WSEN. Also, when I try to zoom in to see the number of a highway, the number stays small even though the highway itself enlarges.

I will not be renewing my subscription for the next month. | Motorcyclist and iphone users dream app. The best of the best. migrated from a dedicated Garmin device to this and brought all my routes over no problem. | This app is well thought out and purposefully built for the traveler. I had searched long and hard for an app that would serve me well on my cross country motorcycle treks …. Recommended it to all my friends. Sponsorship ??? | It is a good well thought out system, but if it were going to get better, it would have the exit number on the interstate highways. | Every update keeps this app getting better and better. It’s my go-to route creation tool for all my motorcycle trips. Highly recommended! | Love the app I am an oversize load escort. Even when raining when other apps stopped working enroute kept working. The only complaint I have is it would be great if you added exit numbers. Because sometimes I have to go to google to find exit numbers to stay on routes that we are permitted to go on by the states.it is the best tool that an escort can have in this business because we are not permitted to leave the route the states have given for any reason. | Great product. Needs mile post on the ramps | I really can’t say enough good things about this app. Sure, there are plenty of apps out there that will route you among multiple waypoints, but this one is different. To say it is designed intentionally is an understatement. The app automatically routes you to the next waypoint after reaching the previous one. The best part is little to know interface is required to keep the app running, which cuts down under distractions and ultimately increases productivity. I have found the app works best on an iPad but it’s great on iPhone as well. For five bucks, I think it’s the best money you can spend if you are in the delivery business or just want to efficiently route multiple steps into your day. What a steal- five stars all day. | I wish it would tell me of a turn while I’m on the phone | Be careful- not all routes are public roads. Pulling a fifth wheel is not easy. | Great app but needs a pause route button for when we stop at a waypoint but don’t want to end the route so it will quite giving verbal directions or tell you to return to route while walking around with my phone in my pocket.

A must-have feature for any travel enthusiast! | 'My Travel Map' is a cool feature! I can view all my travel photos pinned on a world map. I just got new photos from Thailand, and it can sync immediately. The new update truly change how I look back my trips! | I really like Nowy and can't plan a trip without it now! Not only it give me great ideas and itineraries using the planning features, but also the way it organizes all the guides and trips together. I've tried the new features of auto-journaling and well done - so much time saved! I absolutely love it. I do hope the journal part can be more flexible so that I can correct some of the AI-identified places | The function to automatically generate an itinerary starting from the days of duration of the trip is quite nice | I have used more than dozens of travel apps, but this one hands down the best I’ve ever used. It does not only gives you a detailed plan for attractions in cities - which is just a start, you can find the closest hotels, add your flight; customize your routes and find any activities as well. You can switch it to Google map as well. I’m so impressed with this app and really is “The” travel cọmpanion. | Nowy has many useful features, including AI-powered travel itinerary generation, hotel booking, and flight booking. Although I don’t have any travel plan at the moment, I can create and share future plans with my family and friends. Additionally, it’s easy to edit! | OMG this is such a game changer! They used AI to help me journal my past trips too and never thought it can be such an easy and fun way to journal my trips. I have been using Nowy to plan my trips and now I can journal past trips as well. It makes me wanna travel more! | Finally found a travel app that I can search any cities and even small destinations in Brazil and Mexico. It’s amazing, easy to use, great idea and cute pages. The best thing I like is the AI can keep recọmmending different hidden gems besides what you already had in the existing itinerary. Simply amazing! | It is really great and does everything I need. It’s perfect for organizing trip details and plan everything together.  I personally love it and worths 5 stars | I loves traveling and exploring new places but always struggles with planning. I can’t believe how this app is so easy to get a planning for you. Definitely recọmmend this app to anyone who wants to simply your travel. | I am so happy to have found Nowy! I used to spend so much time with vacation planning, but Nowy does it all for me in just a few minutes. Plus, I can book flights, hotels, and activities all in this app! No need for 10 different apps or websites anymore. Highly recommend Nowy!!! | I was booking a last minute trip to Amsterdam and decided to try Nowy to help me plan. Let’s just say, I am so impressed! It helped us find a last minute hotel one stop from the main station for a really good price. It also gave us suggestions of where to eat, what museums to attend and planned out the days with efficient travel routes. Some of the highlights of my trip that Nowy’s AI assistant suggested were: the Heineken Experience, the body museum, and a nighttime canal cruise to Amsterdam during the winter light festival (which was our favorite). It also gave us some great suggestions of local places where the locals eat. I can’t wait for my next trip! | I used to use Google Drive and sheet to plan out my trips. I NO longer need to do so.
This is app has made our trip planning so easy especially while planning a 10 day road trip from Las Vegas to Arizona and Utah! The itinerary has all the website, photos and addresses everything. Surprisingly we can see our live location inside the our trip and know the distance to the next stop!

After we finished the trip and organized the final itinerary, I found the itinerary can be shared completely to our friends and see the full itinerary by the share link! This is amazing and I don’t need to send Doc any more. What a life saver!

So good and helpful! | I was trying to plan a 3-day trip to Tokyo, and the AI generated a decent itinerary based on my preference. I shared the itinerary with my friend, and it got us started on planning out the Tokyo trip!! Highly recommend it to anyone looking to save time when planning trips. I hope the app will automatically find me the best deals based on my finalized itinerary. | I’ve been searching for an app that’s user friendly and aesthetic to journal my trips and after using Nowy for a while I know this is it! The app is easy to navigate through and has many great options to customize your trips the way you want. On top of that, I can search what fun locations are near me to explore. As a lazy but eager traveler, this feature has pushed me to go outside more. There’re new features coming out continuously to create better user interfaces. I absolutely love it! | This is an awesome app, great idea, very useful for travel and provide a lots of information.

From our experience — and by talking to lots of people in the travel community — we realised that although travelling is great, sometimes stuff can get in the way of having a good time.

The unnecessary hassle of organising a trip. The pains of deciding where to go and what to do. Stuff going wrong whilst you're away. 

We exist to help you escape this bad stuff. So you're free to have a more mindful, authentic and memorable trip.

Our mobile app provides a home for all of your travel plans. So you can get inspiration, organise a trip and protect yourself all in one place.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/09/ed/87/09ed873f-6094-8dad-e7c1-cb765f9eec3f/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-10-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Lifestyle""]","[""6003"",""6012""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","174588928","13.4","2019-11-13T08:00:00Z","2024-03-26T12:49:48Z","We’ve got a BIG update for you, the Pogo Community, that really hope you love:

- Book Hotels - We’ve implemented the ability to book hotels directly in Pogo. No need to leave the app.
- Hotel Liking - Hotel research has never been easier. Like a hotel? Simply swipe it to the right in the list or double tap a hotel in Map View.
- Offline Mode - Upon opening Pogo for the first time on this version, a copy of your Pinboards will be kept on your phone so you don’t need Wifi/Data to access all your Pinboards when travelling.
- Bug fixes - As usual we’ve also done some other bug fixes that have been kindly fed back to us from our users. Thank you all for you feedback, it helps a lot.

Please feel free to get in touch with us at hello@pogo.travel with your thoughts or feedback. We love hearing from you and we’re working hard on implementing all the features you guys are eager to have in Pogo.

Until next time,

The Pogo Team","7.1.3",0,"USD",true,1470248251,"Pogo Travel Ltd","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/pogo-travel-ltd/id1470248251?uo=4","https://pogo.travel/",4.78054,"With the new app update I have lost my existing boards sadly. | I’ve tested out a couple of different trip planning apps and I really like the idea of Pogo the best so far, but I’ve been playing around with it for about 10 min and have had to close it out and reopen at least 5 times because it freezes. Has a lot of potential, but definitely needs work! Hope it improves quickly! | I love and miss the layout and design of pluto i was obsessed! But pogo is good as well! I love the detail and i love planning trips with this app! | The idea is there and I love the search and find option but the app is slow and anytime I click to view a category the app freezes or restarts. You’d think that exiting the app would fix that problem, but it’s just rinse and repeat and still freezes when trying to view the categories. Which really makes it more hassle than what it’s worth. | THE REBRAND IS SO BAD, I’m devastated. Pluto was one of my favorite apps and I can’t stand using the new version. The old branding was unique, beautiful and had character, not to mention the usability and functionality was also amazing. Was this rebrand tested with literally any users?? It could not have gotten positive responses. | Sorry, but the new branding is horrendous. I LOVED the old Pluto, and had it proudly on my home screen. The new logo, name, everything is so awful I’m tempted to delete the app altogether. I know rebranding takes time, effort, and money, but this was not the way to go, in my honest opinion. It feels like a cheap imitation of a popular social app, instead of embracing the unique beauty that was the old app. | I am not sure how this app received so many great reviews. It was very difficult to navigate. the flow didn’t make sense. I just was not impressed overall. | Tbh I never write reviews especially for an APP 💀BUT I’m planning a road trip soon and super exited so I wanted something to help keep me organized ✨it’s actually pretty good and cute and neat it’s like Pinterest in a way . I’m not a bot either :) thanks Pluto ! | The aesthetic of this app is incredible. 

One HUGE thing I wish it had is an actual
itinerary in date/time order. You can save everything in this app but it won’t show you a timeline like other travel apps do. 
Add that and a widget for your home screen, and I wouldn’t need any other app for travel. 

Unfortunately right now it doesn’t work 100% alone for me, I still use TripIt for the itinerary timeline feature. | I was looking for an app that would allow me to collaborate trip ideas with my friends. With very few reviews, I was uncertain, but decided to give Pluto a try and I’m so glad I did! 
So far the user experience is top notch. The app is running very smoothly, no lags or glitches. It’s very intuitive and user-friendly, and in minutes I was easily able to navigate myself around, start a trip and invite my friend to collaborate. 
A few suggestions:
When initially walking through the first steps, I would like to be able to pick a region to travel, not just a specific state or city. For instance, I wanted to be able to say Pacific Northwest, but that wasn’t an option. Also, I would like to be able to create my own categories within the trip. 

Solid five stars for usability and of course that it’s free. | i’ve been on the hunt for a travel/itinerary app that was easy on the eyes and incredibly user friendly! | I normally look at Pinterest or YouTube to look up things to do. I love that they already have popular things to try. | Awesome app for planning our holiday! there were lots of things I look for - but until now, I haven’t seen them all in one place. 
The app is very easy to use. You can also save ideas and places to eat. 
And also it served you up inspiration from the app’s recommendations. Top marks! | This app is off to a great start, they definitely have more to add, but I’m enjoying the flexibility and functionality they have now. It’s allowed me to share the plan with my friends and family going on a trip together. Also it allowed us to collaborate on the plan so that everyone has input on what we are doing on the trip so no one feels left out. | The app crashes as soon as you open it",4.78054,442,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2b/ae/ee/2baeee35-400f-691a-338f-212f45d36e55/4a1510bf-e8c4-418f-9632-8e5307164337_Pinboard_-_Slide_1_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/45/c6/49/45c649bc-0fb6-266d-6c63-704dd14f8ab2/463904db-0c02-400a-8a6a-89fc962cee89_MapView2_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6a/f7/c0/6af7c04f-56b9-43fb-d2d1-66e8e14156bc/e74af584-e6e7-4c33-93f7-2b7f31fef97f_Stays_-_Slide_3_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/00/f1/cb/00f1cbe0-ad83-14aa-e8ce-0f2bd9ba786e/ba7467e5-66e1-45d6-92a5-1368ce83c289_Recommend_-_Slide_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/53/b2/89/53b28973-0ba8-a4d2-c6da-7cd49f2f2022/a063b10a-0b5c-49d1-a356-3cfa24810af6_Reviews_-_Slide_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Little wait time, nice vehicle, knowledgeable, competent and friendly staff. Service with a smile. Special kudos to Jose and Larry.  They were fantastic and even gave us precise directions to where we needed to go - no need for GPS.  They are excellent customer service ambassadors.  Thus is my second time back and I will not hesitate to book with Alamo again. | Es un rollo comprar paquetes. Siempre. Están  haciendo. Fraude. No es una plataforma segura.  Nada segura. It's a pain to buy packages. Always. They are doing. Fraud. It is not a secure platform. Nothing safe. | Easy to use , quick | Prime location, clean rooms , English speaking staff. I especially liked the convenience of arranging taxi through the hotel | Don’t ever stay here yes there a reason why it’s cheap. The place was disgusting and gross. There’s cars parked there for long term with all tires flat right in front of the building. Looks like someone is living in the car. The hotel room was horrible and I left didn’t even stay the second night that I paid for. | The code this app uses can be breached and your flights cancelled.  Bothersome things that are never meant to help.  They never add a free booking only hinder your movement | Made a reservation through Expedia, it’s a okay hotel, we checked in 4/25/24 and did not get a room service the next day breakfast mismanagement no plates and utensils. | No terminal number was given to me I can’t reach anyone.!!! | Not being able to talk to anyone or accomplish anything in the chat now is very frustrating. All I needed was to add someone to my reservation so they could check in but couldn’t get that accomplished in an hour of trying | Website and app never have updated prices when you are trying to change a booking. They show lots of options with no price difference to be paid but no matter which one you select you get an error. That is because there is a fare difference but they don’t show you that. You always have to contact customer support to find that out. Disappointed. False advertising | i booked a hotel and added my one key discount and very frustrated because the app didn’t say i couldn’t use paypal to pay. i wouldn’t have booked the room i got without that discount. i filed a claim with paypal to resolve it because your support was terrible and wouldn’t help me. the lady from your dispute department forced me to close my case. i can’t believe this if how you do business. | Great stay at the Marriott. Staff was amazing, quick checkin process. Room was small but updated. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant which was really good. Hotel only has valet parking, which was $60. Not a lot of parking options in the area. | The number of errors in searching, page access errors, inability to download to phone, and internal invalid URLs makes me wonder how they stay in business | I never received an email stating that my rewards were expiring or when they would expire so I saved them for a trip I was planning, Now they take it away with no notice and say theres nothing they can do. This is not how you keep customers and I feel like I have been robbed. | Great hotel, with great views. The staff was impeccable, they couldn’t do enough for us. | The App is a complete failure. When I log into the app it says my email and password does not match. Using the security code fails too. But the website works fine with the same email and password. Customer service tried to blame me saying I must have made some entry error. This has gone on for months since my last trip. Maybe I will use a competing service next trip! | Need ability to get a live person. Need to make a change with no option for it. | Why dont i have options to add a car rental anad or stay on the app when booking a flight? | They are horrible. No matter how hard  you try you will never be able to speak with a representative. They say you can cancel on line. Good luck with that. | Descargue la app pero cuando la abro se cierra automáticamente | The web site seems full of ads and rabbit holes. I found it difficult to get to where I wanted to go. | I loved the room just enough for one person and yes l would return that hotel the Atmosphere was nice. And most importantly the  staff was
Wonderful everyone was so very nice. | This compay provide its services inside the settlements which are built of stolen Palestinian land ! Boycott Expedia | There is no help. I am trying to get two online Expedia accounts merged together as 1. I have an old email and new email but I only need 1 Expedia account. All they want to talk about is my reservation | Delta is horrible   Bought tickets to Rome for my  83 year old and me for June 17 round trip. She has heart failure and had been hospitalized twice we submitted proof and delta would not let me su substitute someone else or refund our money. Told me I could  bring a corpse. Would not give Expedia one star. Expedia would not help at all No credit or 
Money | I love the app and a lot of the amenities but when you have an issue, it is a nightmare, trying to get support that you can actually talk to. | I recently booked a hotel through Expedia. My mistake not checking the reviews first only went by their nice photos.  I purchased the insurance and tried to cancel the reservation but they would not. The hotel was Oyó in Monroe La. Book at your own risk.  

If I could give them some negative stars I would. The guy from the Expedia team gave me a wrong number to some sex line. They were RUDE & VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. DO NOT BOOK | If you miss a lower rate the best Expedia can do is say Sorry | How am I supposed to use the app when it won’t let me sign into it. | They were very accommodating at checking me in early and out late - I’ll have to say even during breakfast a nice man helped me with my tray- very nice and accommodating during my stay. Would definitely stay again. | i was trying to do something but got this pop up 

stop CTA spam | Beautiful hotel and location. great restaurant delicious food and great staff. | I use iphone13 mini.
I could install the app, but it won't open. Keep crashing. | Elle and Gilly went above and beyond while checking in. | Hertz did not have my rental even with rsvp. Other vehicles available but wanted to charge more instead of honor their rsvp and price. Hertz never again!!!! Went to enterprise more professional and better customer service.  

You might want to check your vendor hertz in castleton Indiana. They are scandalous | I booked a flight and I’m trying to check the flight times. The app crashes and now it is saying that my flight is confirmed but it won’t open for me to see the times. | Hotel had no staff after hours and in process of getting refund kept kicking me out of app when switching to get ridiculously long itinerary number and chat is run by people who speak little to no English and inept. First and last time using Expedia app. Before apps they were excellent | This place is great! Very inviting. Smells good. Comfy beds. | Expedia? Or One Key? Or what?
Signed in, but need to sign in again?
Horrible experience | When buying a ticket late. It’s all good. | If you are looking for peace of mind , don't ever book through Expedia..
They as overall perspective is not responsive..i was surprised to see that they don't have flights on their app for certain destinations..😏😏😏😏i Booked few trips but I understood now they are overall poor and don’t want to improve or take feedback , they ll just revert through automated emails or standard formats.. | Unable to sign up and unable to get to my booking.
I would give you a negative star! | Very nice, clean hotel with comfortable beds/pillows. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Plus the location was perfect! Downtown without being right on Broadway, which helps for noise since it is rockin all night. Highly recommend! | Excelente | This app does very little to help with canceled flights or complications while traveling. Generally speaking, it’s very difficult to get help from Expedia. It’s easy to book (give Expedia your money) but anything else besides that is painstakingly horrible. If an airline cancels your flight, Expedia simply gives up and says call the airline. | When and where I love this app | The new rewards system is garbage. Between here and hotels.com I’ve spent tons of money and only got 44$ in rewards. I book all my hotels through here or hotels.com and I can assure you that once I burn through the rewards i have left till be using another travel booking system. | I booked three rooms. I received confirmation for 2 but not the third. I sought help. I received an inadequate response and then the typing in the chat was disabled. Now I have no way to resolve this issue.

• Adjusted padding to optimize for iPhone 14 Pro models","6.13.4",0,"USD",true,1737543855,"Kenneth L Horning II","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/kenneth-l-horning-ii/id1737543855?uo=4","http://www.tourapp.co",4.38182,"I’ve been using this app to plan my bachelorette party and I love this app but I can’t share my itinerary with half my girls because it’s not compatible with android, Samsung, or google phones. Not everyone has Apple so it’s best to make your app cross compatible for all devices. | So far I am liking this app very much. I am using it to plan a trip to London and with the exception of o e bug I am finding it useful. 

When adding an activity to a daily itinerary the transportation menu only gives you walk,car,bike as options and excludes public transportation. Once you have added the activity you have to select the travel time in the itinerary and switch it to public transportation. 

It would be nice if the app tied into Google maps and calculated transportation time rather than relying on the person to figure it out. | Great for people who enjoy outstanding graphic visuals as opposed to bland black and white itineraries thrown together on Google docs. | I’ve used this for my last 5 trips. I’m never going back to TripIt! | I am absolutely blown away at how beautiful this app is. I am building apps with the same technology that the developers of this app uses, and I admire them for being able to pull this off so well. | I’ll start with what I love:
- Beautiful UI with nice details throughout
- Does a great job of using location photography and the UI to make the places your going exciting (compared to a lot of overly utilitarian apps out there like TripIt)
- The map with lines to where all you’re going and the sequence is awesome and something I’ve really wanted on past trips before finding this app
- Easy to discover places to go in the city you’re going

What still needs some work:
- When searching for places to add, the font size is too large and cuts off the right end of names so it can be hard to tell which is which (like with hotel names that can be different locations for the same chain)
- Before getting to exact times for each place you want to go there needs to be a staging step where you can add locations w/o time to decide on which you want to go to, then add a time or to the timeline after sharing or knowing for sure you want to go. 
- The drag and drop is frustrating currently because as you add more places to the timeline it ends up making existing ones shorter instead of pushing them to the next hour. Having to go back and make something that became 10-15 minutes (which very few events make sense to be that short) and resizing them doubles to triples the time it takes to add all the events.

What would make it a 6 star app:
- Having hotels in it is fantastic...but why not the flights? If you’re going to multiple destinations it leaves an odd whole in your timeline to not have the flights and be able to plan for how early you need to checkout of the hotel or how much time you have for other stuff.
- iPhone is great for while you’re traveling, but an iPad version would help a ton for planning the trip and seeing the details of locations and events with more room. | Tried this app during the beta and liked it, but I did not get to try it much. Now I can’t get it to work because all it does is crash.

Edit: Still crashes on startup. I did not say it crashes when opening old trips because I can’t even open the app.
Edit2: I don’t know if it’s a bot answering my reviews, but again: opening old trips is not the issue. The issue is that I can’t open the app because all it does is crash. I wish I could enjoy the potential of this app, but it is impossible when it won’t open.
Edit3: App is now working! | Looking forward to seeing this continue evolving. | Adding more than 2 cities to a trip didn’t work. Sometimes a third popped up, but when adding a fourth both the third and fourth just disappeared. | UI seems nice but functionally there are some issues as others have mentioned. Right now I can’t even remove a trip, it just freezes up during the loading state. Really want something like this to work but at the least, devs should have some sort of tests in place that catch these kinds of major bugs.

Edit: originally gave 3 stars but I literally can’t even open my trips now without an error. It’s not functional at all. | Tried to plan a bachelor party with this app but with out the ability to share with the boys defeats the point of creating an itinerary | I really wanted to love this app, but it isn’t very intuitive and is hard to use. I am trying to plan a trip to Japan with multiple destinations, and when I try to adjust the dates of one the rest of them get messed up! I also somehow got the destinations out of order and can’t figure out how to put them back. I also experienced loading screens that went on forever, it was the screen when I picked Japan as my destinations and it displayed an error message. I’m hoping these problems get fixed, because I really like the app otherwise. | This app is the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. It was incredibly glitchy, very inaccurate information, and in general just hard to use. 
I don’t know who the makers of this app are, but you need to go back to the drawing board. I’d honestly rather use Google Maps as a tourist planning app than this, and we all know how Google Maps is not even good. 
Also, the logo is a complete ripoff of the Tesla logo. Really shows lack of creativity. Just from seeing the logo I knew there wasn’t much hope. 
Have a nice day. | Well the developers are my friends + this app kind of blew my mind. So I'll give it a five star. Probably add an instruction video at the very beginning? Actually took me a while to find the drag feature.

So pleased to have everything at our fingertips vs having to use 4 different apps for things like gas stations, rest stops and offbeat attractions.  

Well done | I’ve used Roadie twice to take a long road trip, and loved it both times. it’s extremely easy to use simply plug in your destinations and add them to your route. it offers a way to kind of schedule/rearrange your itinerary, which is extremely helpful. You can use the itinerary to plan out how long each day will be or what you plan on doing each day of your trip. I did what seem to be bugs in certain areas. For example I was planning a trip that was going on the “Going to The Sun” road and for some reason it kept calculating the route going around the whole park to the other side. | I can’t fully commit to paying for premium if I can’t see what I am paying for.  I need an app I can commit to for my trips. There’s not enough with the free version to make an informed decision.  So I will go with the competitor RoadTripper. With that I can see what I am paying for. Too bad. I was open to trying something different from the usual. 

Unfortunately they lost me as a customer from the beginning.  Maybe in the future they’ll change this and I can consider them for my next series of trips. 

Roadie if your reading this, please consider. | Free version is worthless. Maybe it’s better if you pay. | I would use this app over Google maps but they make you pay just to invite your friends to your map which is kinda stupid considering that majority of the times you are going to want to share with friends | Love the idea, but tons of little issues that make it super annoying to try and use. Definitely not subscribing for another month but I appreciate their efforts. Maybe in another few iterations it'll get to a product that feels pleasant to use. | What is the point of this app VS just going straight to Apple Maps?  This still just takes you to Apple Maps and in fact makes it a lot less seem-less. Bugged I wasted my money because I forgot to cancel before trail was up and was charged for a full year. Not sure where they got all their good reviews. | The app was everything I wanted while planning my road trip from Kentucky to Utah and California!  Super easy to use and works great, and I like that I was able to name stops and split it up into sections so it made it easy to keep track of what day I was planning each stop! | I’ve spent 15 minutes playing and find it way to lacking on everything. I cannot even find the way to read the step by step instructions for a route.

Very minimal web site also. Not discussion that I see about the Premium at all.

Not enough reviews to be rated after 3 years.

I feel they need a macOS app as I prefer using a real keyboard and a larger screen display to plan my trips. Yes, the iPad app will run on an M1 Mac albiet in a tiny screen window.

I'll stick with the great Road Trip Planner - far more features. | After easily installing, I had issues with the app. Mainly text and print not lining-up correctly. Deleted and will stick with Waze. | Used the app for road-tripping all over the West. Convenient and effective. The developers are accessible and ultra responsive. Totally worth the upgrade! | I thought I would be able to put in multiple stops and build a itinerary but, I don’t think it allows and the app is not user friendly. | ဆက်မသုံးတော့ဘူး | This is the app I would have made - super fast, clean, simple, but still has everything you need to plan a trip. Extremely well done, I bought the lifetime immediately (thank you for having that as an option and not forcing me into a subscription plan). | Just getting started. So far, simple & easy to read. | Not paying for an app that you can't try first. | I was hoping to import a trip into this app hoping to use some of its features, but all I get is an error. Tried several different trip files and restarting ect, but nothing has worked. Wish I could get the $30 bucks back. | Very disappointed the the paid version of this app. I was hoping to use the app to plan ahead and see stops to add along the way. We are going from texas to Florida, I mapped the route, clicked hotels and it showed a group of hotels in north Arkansas (a state we are not even entering). The companies soliton is too zoom in, piece by piece rather being able to conclusively plan the trip, we have too basically look 4-5 times but by bit. There is not way better than any free app such as Google Maps to plan a route. In fact google maps actually shows things “along the route”. | Easy to use and share plans.
Wish I could plan day of driving or have app auto plan days. Seeing upcoming weather and better ‘attractions’ highlights would make it a killer app. | Hard to navigate, adds stops out of order and you can’t change them. It’s impossible to sort out. Canceling | Can’t find and add stops, can’t get alternative routes for entire trip. | Love this app.. work better than road warriors | We downloaded the app to find scenic routes, and interesting things along the way. Attractions, Gas Stations, Campsites, Hotels, Parks, etc. are all behind the paywall. Without purchasing the premium subscription, it’s a less useful map app. | This app is paid app when most are free | I love the interface. Very easy to use and can search for just about anything I type into the map search. The smart insert feature is also great when adding a new point to your route in the middle. It gives you estimated miles and times between your points so you know how long/far you will be traveling any leg. Your can save trip routes for planning more than one trip at a time (2 in free version, infinite in purchased version). 
As I pull a travel trailer (RV) for my trips, there are a few things I would like to see added and be able to test in the free version before I purchase the upgrade.
1- allow specs of my travel trailer (length, height, weight, propane on board) to be entered so the app can map around any low clearance bridges, weight limited roads, propane limited tunnels, hairpin turns, etc. to be sure the road mapped is safe for travel with my RV.
2- ability to identify specified miles and/or time travel down a route so that a campground/stay search can be done in that area. Currently, I take a guess by sight, add a random stay point to the route and see how long/far it takes to get there. If wrong, remove point, guess further up or back and repeat until my miles/time is close to what I want to travel in a leg. It’s functional but could be made much easier if the app can just pin a point in the route at how far/long you want to travel as an option.

With these 2 functionality adds, this app would be worth purchasing for me. | I hate that so many apps these days say they’re free but once you start trying to maneuver around the app, you find out you can’t do much of anything without paying some monthly or annual fee. | After paying for the app, as the free version would not allow me to complete my trip, I found it kept rerouting me to roads I did not want to travel on. Would not allow me to select the road I wanted. It is like a section of the road did not exist even though it shows the road on the map. I attempted to use the Contact Us (send an email) and it does not work. Fortunately they only got one months worth of payment out of me. The trip I am planning is on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Once you purchase the app they provide a sample trip of the Blue Ridge Parkway and it is jacked up too.

Update:  after contacting the developer they did a great job of explaining the issue and provide a resolution. Response from developer was fast and professional. I will continue to use the app for my upcoming trips. | When I opened the app, it grabbed a location near me from GPS and made it my home location. When I attempted to change it to my actual address, I was prompted to upgrade to the full version to be able to do so. Really? How are you supposed to plan a trip without setting a starting point?

Failure to be able to change even the most basic information without paying for the full version renders the app unusable to me. I can understand that adding locations, or notes, would require an update to the full version, but preventing a user from setting up a basic profile is pretty unforgivable. Deleting this app immediately! | This is not a very good user friendly app and I wish I had never purchased it!!!! Sad :-( | So easy to use. Can’t wait to plan more trips | Was trying to plan a road trip from Illinois - Oregon - California - Oregon - Illinois and this app was just perfect for giving us the ability to plan out stops for fuel, find great rest stops along the way and even some crazy attractions.
I would recommend this app to anyone who is wanting to plan any kind of road trip. On my trip back to Illinois, I was able to follow Rte 66 and see all of the attractions that I have been wanting to go see. 
The only thing that I had to watch out for was when finding the next stop on my route was that the ‘Smart Add’ feature sometimes inserted the stop in the wrong place so it had me going backwards at a couple of points. But other than that, this is a great app. Thanks for making it happen. | Downloaded the free version, worthless, doesn’t make me want to pay for upgrade, put locations in bizarre order, making the trip twice as long as needed, says you can tap and drag to change order of places? How? Guess you have to pay?
Useless! | This app would be a 10/10 if it had landscape mode!!!

Update: landscape mode added! It’s awesome now. | Love the concept. It started basic but getting better and it appears the developers listened to feedback and have since updated the app to make it even better. | The app says it works on iPad and iPhone.  I downloaded it on my iPad.  It wouldn’t orient itself with the iPad.  It only works when the iPad is held vertically.  My case prevents that.  I then tried it on my iPhone X.  I was able to creat an account.with no trouble.  However, when I tried to actually use the app, it would send me to location services in settings.  This continued even after I enabled everything for the app.  I’ve defeated the app and will look for one that I can actually plan trips on. | Handles multiple stops very elegantly, love that collaboration is now possible. Overall very intuitive to use. Would love to see a smart order feature that orders all stops in a route and/or section, and would also be a nice to have to calculate the price of fuel for the trip. 

Once you’re on the road I could also see a good feature being what is easily accessible for the next 5 or so exits. Often we’re looking for a bathroom or something to eat and by the time we figure out whether it’s on our side of the freeway we’ve passed the exit 😂

Glad to have this app, and have had a lovely experience with any communication with the development team. | This is a great simple app for planning a road trip. Love the design and simplicity, and the developer is very responsive to feedback. | It’s an app that just draws a line from one place to another, and you can add stops along the way. Not much else. If it does any of the other things- I can’t find out how because there’s like 6 buttons and the ui is bad. | This is a great app. Would like just a couple more options but a really great app. Thank you!!",4.59365,1511,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/3f/d7/9b/3fd79ba6-8b2b-0a32-f0b7-214c40fbbc85/c33a3ebd-2e6c-4987-8753-974428cbe7c8_iOS_small_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/cb/00/85/cb0085c7-4d8f-f676-ac79-b927ab27db7b/4361969b-a1dc-4bf6-9e4c-ddf38ebbc9d4_iOS_small_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/24/1b/91/241b91dc-27ce-3a0c-b1ad-ef1dc130af9b/008ba569-449e-416f-b90f-c6e1004bf101_iOS_small_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/cb/a4/34/cba43489-b613-fed3-26ee-d6d7368cdc71/3ab099ef-a598-4e88-93e4-e47e02ba255f_iOS_small_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/7f/2b/d9/7f2bd98a-0bb2-aedc-826f-1b54129ebe50/9fbabe0f-890e-42c0-9838-0853c288d28e_iOS_small_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/63/5e/2f/635e2ff5-3fb6-0e28-97be-8eee37e1977e/cf1b6faf-0cb8-4401-9c59-841c92052dd3_iOS_small_6.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/6f/7b/44/6f7b44bd-512f-1ca3-c19b-3e174ee934dc/47bd4344-f431-4448-ac2b-76de7b7471f9_iPad_Pro_0.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/a8/6d/bb/a86dbbc9-b423-8a0e-8038-55d2019f7352/b6ba20ba-aff6-4339-b1b3-f031aac6d25f_iPad_Pro_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/8e/c5/f3/8ec5f350-bd5a-2686-8f94-c981b48446c9/e0b97803-78fe-4fa6-b16c-663b6918bd92_iPad_Pro_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/b1/a6/bf/b1a6bffc-3b5e-33a0-e64d-55ce0eb07950/2cfadebf-1236-4fc5-a9d1-76ff511d945a_iPad_Pro_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/82/c3/14/82c31463-99c6-1a3e-c398-f90f281a22db/af51ac90-d468-47ad-83fd-82888a854237_iPad_Pro_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/75/a7/da/75a7daf4-1b1e-19bc-1b91-d926f99141be/722d45e8-b912-41cd-9ed2-de78456f56f9_iPad_Pro_5.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Pl

It’s now my “go to”, whenever I need to travel. I highly recommend it. | All on one page | Fantastic | So I turned on the alerts months ago to notify me of the best deals to book my flights to Mexico. Every time I checked in it would tell me to hold off and wait for a better deal. Now I’m a month out from booking my trip and flights are the most expensive they’ve been! Not once did it recommended I purchase my tickets (which by the way the best deal was a few months ago). 

The whole point of this app is to help save money on flights and travel. If you can’t even do that right you’re failing at the your whole purpose. I’m deleting this app after I post this.

Just stick to google flight. | 💪💪💪💪 | I am a new Hopper user.

Not sure what the point is of forcing me to go through my email and the website to reset my password if I still can’t get into the app anyway.

Website works great anyway, and they always email a receipt. Makes the app seem redundant, and useless to me at least. | رووعه | 很方便 | Thank you | The apartment was exactly like pictured and very nice, clean, in quite area, not far from the Duomo, Academia. | The apartment was clean and updated.  It was in an excellent location to bars, tattoo parlors, and coffee shop’s.  The owner made sure we new the area and when I asked questions they responded in a timely manner.   We we’re giving the option for late check out at a cost and laundry on site.  Minutes from downtown and free trails. | Booking.com it's basically a scam, never ever book using this app... UPDATE: they offer to solve the problem with their costumer support but NO number, just FAQs there and only the Email with a request of the reserve data and 3 days later no response right there then is another confirmation this is a totally scam. | I kept checking the site and a reasonably priced condo, near family was available. Will add feedback about the condo | I only book through Booking.com ; I’ve been a member since 2019 and haven’t looked back. Their customer service is incredible and I always get the best deals- even internationally! 1000/10 | Can’t reach the hotel.  Can’t reach Booking.  They farmed my reservation out to some company called AIRBIGBUS.  When I did reach the hotel, they did not know about my reservation.  Then I get a message from Booking saying that they don’t always tell the hotel until a few days before you go.  My reservation is non-refundable, so I don’t know if I’m supposed to pay twice just to ensure that I have something. I had to do that for my last trip.  This company isn’t trustworthy. | Appreciate how easy it is to navigate on this app!!! | Very veryvery goood , location and staff was imazing high recomended | I like the hotel so much always Iam staying with you and you provide amazing service,
Thank you for all reception team specially Mr Mahmoud who always and Gulzar | 🤷🏾‍♂️ | Great price and awesome location  to university | بصراحة فندق ولا اروح من خدمة نظافة تعاون كل الشكر لموظفين الاستقبال رجال ونساء متعاونين وطيبين وخلوقين الف الف شكر | My husband and I have stayed the last three summers.  We are pleased with the parking, the location, the cleanliness, the stay. | It is ridiculously user friendly and I love surfing on it for hours just for fun. However they offer me a better deal each time I book an accommodation through this app. 

Also, the filter function gives you the possibility to get what you actually want. I love it | Super easy to book | I’m been using this app for about 8 years love it | I have never been let down by booking.com. They have helped me even in last minute situations | This compay provide its services inside the settlements which are built of stolen Palestinian land ! Boycott booking.com | I have made about 10 bookings through Booking.com. This app doesn’t show all my bookings. 
Have to go through emails to find details about my reservations that  I made through booking.com. | Last minute plans to book a place down Cape Cod made easy when I looked into making reservations with booking.com. Hassel free and pretty easy to sign up. Would use again whenever I need to book a place, thanks booking.com | Great place to stay! Clean and very good location. Loved new window shades! | Was very easy to book.    Got a room right on the beach and was able to pay with Klarna !!!!   So exciting.    Thank you for the easy way to make reservations | Seriously, what a hideous app and user experience when contacting customer service. When you message customer service you cannot add additional information until they have responded back to you. I have an ongoing issue which is up in the ether as I get a bot generated message telling me the message has been forwarded to customer services. No has responded and I cant communicate until then. This was April 10th still no response. If you click the help then a cancel button pops up. I don’t want to cancel I just want my issue resolved! Do better or get better developers! | This flat is very close to the train station. The host is very responsive. Clean place, nice kitchen, good size bath room, the neighborhood is quite. | Booking is easy and efficient! I give it a n enthusiastic endorsement! | Great app | Strongly recommend this application. | It seems impossible to get ahold of an actual person to help me with my issue. I paid for the insurance for the flight and apparently that was a waste because it doesn’t cover cancellations or flight changes. The app keeps asking me for information that was never provided to me. | Very easy to reservation | Good and very convenient | Easy to use, app is great | Everything about this place is perfection. This is what it must feel like to be rich. The staff was incredibly supportive and accommodating. They immediately learned my name and greeted me everytime I came and went.  They were interested in making sure my trip to Cambodia was memorable and took care of every detail without being intrusive.  They were helpful without being pushy. Lina, the manager, spent an enormous amount of time making sure I had wifi on my phone and never made it feel like the inconvenience it was. The room was immaculate, spacious, and beautiful. 
Mr. Kim took care of every detail and followed up to make sure I was satisfied.
As a solo traveler I felt completely safe and comfortable and loved the convenient location of this hotel. 
My only complaint was the noise from the market two blocks away, but the bed was so comfortable I didn’t have any problems falling asleep.  Also, they provided ear plugs i didn’t need.
The food and drinks were also surprisingly delicious and affordable. Staying in this hotel was my favorite part of a three country trip. | Es bien amigable para utilizar, facilita el proceso de reserva | La aplicación es muy afable y siempre segura nunca he tenido ningún contratiempo reservando por esta app | It was very nice to stay here, they are polite hosts✨ the hotel has a very clean environment, the rooms are cleaned in the morning, they also constantly change towels, they have a kitchen both in the room and in the living room, they treated us with a delicious sandwich 🙊 they are very caring and warm, if we come again we will definitely come back here ✨10/10 | I really appreciate all of amazing , cleaning, kindly  staff this is my third time I booked on same hotel, nice and friendly costumer service and so so so clean I want to say thank you to all of management team, and thank you Sohal and Asraf they’re cleaning my room on perfect way and honest people. | Until it wasn’t anymore.  I found that most hotel stays are now “non-refundable” and I wasn’t offered the insurance option.  I think my booking.com days are coming to an end.  I also found my reservation was cheaper on another app after I had already booked the trip.  Some of my prior stays were terrible and the app doesn’t make up for any unpleasant stays.  A review is the best they can do to help which only helps the next person if at all. | The process was easy and did not take all that much time | App is very easy and simple to use. Very user friendly and all information for hotels very detailed and well organized. Hands down an awesome app a must to have on all smart phones and tablet devices. Booking.com rocks! No worries, free your mind... | Booking.com make it so easy and stress free booking a hotel room and offering all of the services in one place with great prices. I highly recommend Booking.com! Super excited for my upcoming trip to see myGrand babies! | Nikola was such a gem to deal with, in every way. He gave us clear directions, met us on the street when we arrived and even provided us with umbrellas. He was not only a friendly host, but also provided a beautiful property! The view is unmatched and the studio was large. The balcony had comfy furniture and the shower was large! This was by far the best experience I’ve had with a property from booking.com from my month long trip to Europe. Thank you again, Nikola! God bless to you and your family. | Excellent sea view and location, beach entrance just cross the street, staff is care and polite, the price is reasonable, will stay here next time visiting QUY NHƠN | If you’re looking to put your short-term rentals on Booking.com, please save yourself the headache and do not do it. Booking.com customer service is the worst I’ve ever dealt with.

I really wanted to like it but the app is poorly designed. Once you enter a trip and locations, there is no edit option. You have to delete the trip and start over. I searched for a help section for instructions but the only choice is to ask on FB, Insta, or email. When I finally gave up and tried to delete my account, the app would freeze once I selected delete, thus not letting me delete. Negative stars in my opinion. | This app is fantastic. Saw someone using it on social media and wanted to give it a try. It is perfect to give yourself a rough draft of your trip or a complete day to day guide. I prefer to figure things out as I go, but there are many features that make it easier. Whether you are going on a family trip or backpacking across Asia, this app will be perfect for you. | Parts of this app I love, but it’s extremely limiting. For example, you can’t alter the dates between one destination to the next. Let’s say you’re taking a cruise and it takes 2 sea days to get from Singapore to Phuket, you can’t account for those 2 days in the planner, it only gives you a 24 hour option which is crazy. The next thing I don’t like is the app doesn’t sync from my phone to my iPad. This is extremely annoying. Whatever changes I make using my iPhone I’ll have to separately go into the iPad app and make those same changes. The third thing I don’t like about this app to the point I may just stop using it all together is every time I do ANYTHING in the app, such as pick a place to eat, the app will freeze for AT LEAST 2 minutes. I wish this app was way more customizable in terms of dates, in between places, etc like TripIt. What I love about it is how it will create a little video of your trip and you can visually see your route, I also love the suggestions like hotels, things to do, and places to eat…love those features. I’d be more than happy to pay for this if they make it better all the way around. | App does not render. Please help | I got the app, signed in with google and it’s stick on the Take Off screen after going thru the steps. When I close it, it wants me to sign in again. Was hoping this would be a great app for travel planning but these glitches make it a no go if I can’t even get into it! | Garbage! Good luck trying to even sign up! Complete joke 😜 | i’m writing this review before i finish planning my trip because i just love this app so far. it still seems like a work in progress but for the most part it’s fully functional! i wish there was a way to add what time you’re landing in the place at the beginning of the trip. if we were also able to see the time zones and the difference between then, that would be perfect. like the US has like 4 time zones and that’s confusing if you don’t know that and are planning a trip [wrote something here but erased it, they have a feature i didn’t figure out till now] overall it’s a cool app! if i could afford to travel more i’d use this app as my main planner instead of the google doc that i use. also note to developers: it would be cool if down the line there was a feature to export the trip as a pdf or whatever pdf file apple uses (pages? i don’t like it tbh). that would be awesome!

only complaint is about adding hotels. sometimes i press the plus, add a link, and it doesn’t show up. i think it saves to my wishlist… | I am trying to plan a trip for October 7th-24th of 2024. If I put those dates in, it wants my first night somewhere to be the 6th and won’t let me change it. We will be on a plane the night of the 7th so our first night under destinations I want to be the 8th. In order to do this I had to make our trip start the 9th. Our last night somewhere will be the 23rd but it told me I had 16/15 nights planned so I had to make the end date the 25th to get the planning itinerary right. This is messed up. My trip for the 7-24 looks like it’s for the 9-25th now for the countdown but right for the Nights planned section. Please correct this and allow us to adjust the nights planned dates for those flying overnight. If this is corrected I would give more stars but this is a really major flaw and doesn’t allow for any flight planning. | Love this app! Finally a user friendly way of planning my trip with friends! Thanks! | I’ve reinstalled several times and the app opens to a blank, white screen. | With this latest update, the app still does not load on my phone. It shows a white screen. | I’ve downloaded this app 3x and it won’t load past the opening white screen each time. I was very excited to try it. | The app looks cool but I’m giving up… you should have used Google maps to find the cities. So many of them can’t be selected even though they appear when exploring the map… why can’t we just add places as easily as finding them on Google maps? Same with finding hotels, very cumbersome… | The app is pretty cool. It allows you see the distance between your locations, add hotel info, track your spending and etc. which is nice and for planning a long trip it will help keep you organized. However, I’ve adjusted the dates of my trip and the new dates will not save. I have even deleted the trip and traded it and it will not save. | Wanted to input a 3-week trip itinerary through multiple countries and I was unable to create a trip directly. Instead, I had to select 1 of the five countries, then manually choose cities in the other countries via the search bar. One issue with this search bar, at the time I was using it, was that neither the capital of Kosovo (Pristina) nor the capital of Albania (Tirana) were options.

I’d have to say though, amidst its imperfections, it is actually a very helpful tool in visualizing how far apart ALL of the cities in your itinerary are, enabling you to make a more manageable trip that more accurately depicts travel times.",4.1875,64,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/c6/2b/cd/c62bcd58-98ac-9371-982a-8de46adb706c/4efa90cd-d1e7-4166-8808-2219bb0cb244_11.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/38/40/f5/3840f528-a57b-14bc-3c62-e600d833df5c/9efbe272-9087-4906-9d4b-0bd6632ad42d_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6c/b3/be/6cb3be61-4d1d-e5f2-f0fe-da613bcd4d3e/8bc5763e-261b-43ab-839d-2dcc65809d8a_0433.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/06/05/59/060559bd-0583-3e40-1537-543994966d7c/91c75ddc-f2b0-4425-ac02-43ce67911f19_0233.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ab/2d/e0/ab2de054-ed3e-06fa-b5a5-a9f344256e62/1731aead-93ad-4dde-a9db-894468bc89b4_12.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4f/2b/e4/4f2be4fc-e537-66b0-1c1c-46b03677d0d0/9c727ed3-0267-4d9c-9d9e-eee682612d86_05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/80/79/bf/8079bf2d-4879-9d2b-476f-a88070f3bdb7/453cdd54-5191-4d0a-a14f-69c589e7d782_08.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/3b/1a/c0/3b1ac0bc-fa3f-0721-03ad-72074f4f9b93/d44e1519-5337-49e6-9ddf-ca243188bcb4_06.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6d/fc/03/6dfc03b6-9857-588d-9fc5-647fbf328196/9be3afeb-819e-4199-a5a1-5aeb4cb9eb49_09.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/db/ba/71/dbba7115-11e2-3d48-2263-a3257d80aa8c/1e136b1b-5493-41c2-8ebb-46e0bb5dfd80_10.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

To see them all I have to scroll and load each recommendation which takes FOREVER. And when I click into any recommendation, I lose my place and have to start over. So it’s virtually impossible for me to actually see all my recommendations laid out. So disappointing, I’ll have to just use google maps | Before you begin there is a short questionnaire which asks who you are traveling with. I put family and children, yet when I inserted my travel destination and had an itinerary generated, it recommended things that were not kid friendly.

Additionally, the questionnaire asks what your budget looks like. Although I chose the lowest bracket, it recommended five star restaurants that were completely unaffordable for me. 

There were a couple hidden gems in the recommendations, but overall it isn’t worth the space it would take up on my phone unless some more moms joined the community to beef up the kid and budget friendly recommendations. | Looking for a great planning tool that allows you to share with others in your group. This is the one, nice layout and many recommendations for your area of stay. | I could not for the life of me figure out how to see any reviews for places in a city. Whoever designed the ui for this app should be fired. | I want to live this app but it’s certainly glitching on me. I’m clicking on what I know is a restaurant I have saved in San Fran and it’s saying it’s a beach. | Great to find people who like what you like, so you can get a better idea of what you may like in new places.

I’ve added a bunch, and the location are off. For example, upstate NY is occasionally included in NYC and 2 of my Japanese restaurants in NYC are being listed as a cathedral location. | I love the concept of the app, but some features don’t work or don’t have a real purpose. It’s really hard to just search an area without looking at someone else’s list. When you search something and add it to a list, the UI just throws you back to a random place and you have to start your search over again. Needs some work on user experience, but I’ll keep using and hope bugs get fixed! | People use Apple Maps for the same use as an app like this. This is just a places finder. So no point and not recommended. | So excited to use this app! Look me up and share your travel tips! @bohemianspirit | I love this app—so helpful for planning trips! If I have one suggestions, it’s that I wish you could add comments/reminders to yourself when you add a place to a trip (e.g., what dish everyone loves at a restaurant). I think you can’t add notes like that when you’re planning, only once you’ve marked it as a recommendation. | I use OOO both for finding new restaurants and as a quasi-travel diary so when I go back to a city I can remember my own favorites! 

With fake reviews / AI seeming to be on the rise on other sites, it’s fantastic that OOO allows you to filter by reviews of people you know. | I love this app, but I think it’s going to take some updates and improvement before this app becomes trendy. Users should be able to categorize places manually because some of them are incorrect—e.g., it lists one of my hotels as something to “do” instead of as a place to stay—and there is no way to change it. I also saved a recommendation in Utah and it is showing up as a location in Michigan. But I would love to see this app grow and for more people to start using it, it has such awesome potential!! | You’re only able to make itineraries with limited items. I work really hard to find hidden gems so it doesn’t really make sense that I can make an itinerary using only the most popular spots | The best way to make the perfect itinerary for all your stops & trips 😍 | Love all the features so far, but how can I make a reservation as I don’t see how you do it using open table. Is a booking feature coming soon? | Not only is the brand name perfect. I love how the app is designed and it’s features. I can definitely see this app being a must have for travellers with a few extra features. 
I use it to plan my trips and save my must go to places. It’s been super handy! 

I would love to see a option on the trips section to share the itinerary via PDF. I can imagine it would look perfect to share with friends who don’t use the app or if you are planning a trip for a family member. 

Keep up the great work! I’m a super fan! Finally an app that not only is pretty but also super useful 🫶🏼 | I love this app. Just starting to use it and I am in love with the My trips part of it. Love being able to add places of interest with times for each day! The only thing is that some of the places I rec show incorrect info on my page. I recommended a place in Utah Wyoming and the final place on my place is showing Ann Arbor, MI. Another is showing incorrect town with a picture that had nothing to do with my review.  Also the feedback does not work on the app. Unable to send any feedback. | EDITS:
Would also love to see the ability to add a “manual” item- for example: hop-on, hop-off bus tours. Would be super helpful to leave a review and just save my pictures and notes from the experience for keepsakes.

This could easily be the next big social media craze, especially with travel coming back! I love the concept: plan and document all my trips in one place, with ability to recap them in the perfect mix of photos and written descriptions, WITH A SCHEDULE :) so I can easily pass down detailed plans. Amazing. BUT, there are definitely features missing before it can go viral… I’d love to see: - The ability to add photos to a place just for you/even if you don’t “rec” a place, so I don’t have to post personal pictures to the internet if I want to use it like a social network with a cute recap of me and my partner on a trips’ pictures for our friends and family. This would go along great with better privacy/sharing settings, so I can share my trips and photos and comments/notes with people, allow others to add comments who are tripmates and maybe a “view only” tier with public/private comments for what I want a friend to be able to see (if someone from work asks for trip recs, but maybe I don’t want them to see my reservation notes on a place but do want them to see my review). | As a travel agent, I LOVE using this app to build trips for my clients. Once all of your activities/hotels/restaurants are loaded, my clients are able to click on the itinerary and everything shows up on the map in their app, which saves them  TONS of time from having to Google everything individually outside the app. Super trendy, modern, and unique recs from all the users. Such a fun travel space to be in! | Amazing for travels recs and finding new places.  I’ve been sending lists of my recs for years and now this makes it so much easier to share with friends! | I hope more people use it, such a cool idea | A really awesome function that should be incorporated in to this beautiful app would be a visually appealing countdown feature for “My Trips”. A bonus would be the ability to create a Home Screen widget for your countdown as well! | So much potential. I got so excited for this app and to use it but has a few problems. This is my first ever review on here because guess what? Your feedback option does not work. You click on submit and does nothing. Do you guys not test your app after updates?
Also, does anybody who works for this app ever use it at all? If so, you can easily catch the glitches and what needs to be fixed. For example, when you click the “back” button, it doesn’t really go back to the previous page you’re on. When i am checking out another person’s profile, clicks on their recs, and then tries to go to back to their page, it doesn’t. It leads me back to my profile! It is so annoying. Please fix this. The app is way too focused on “aesthetic” but has no quality. Way too many problems. | I love this ap!! I love having lists for all my trips in one place, love the aesthetic, & the map feature ! 

I would LOVE to be able to make my own notes for businesses that only I can see. That way any research I’ve done on the place can be there too. For example- a place that doesn’t take reservations for breakfast, I’d like to note that :) | Love the look and design of this app, and the concept and information you get for trips is amazing!! Really helpful to create your own trip folders or wishlists all in one place with pictures, location etc etc. convenient and helpful to get you to all the places you’re wanting! 

The docked star is due to some interface annoyances through using the app. When clicking into someone’s recommendation from a trip and clicking the back arrow it brings you all the way back to the search page rather than that person’s trip to continue looking through their reccos. So you have to find your way back to where you were if you want to continue browsing. | Love this concept and the ease of use of the app. As a business owner, I wish there was a way we could edit information that isn’t correct, such as hours of operation. I understand the concept is for this to be different than Yelp, just wish we could provide accurate information. | This app is a beautiful way to plan trips and to remember past trips. | So helpful to see hometown recommendations! Love love love this app and can’t wait to see all the new features that get added 🙌🏽 | As someone who loves traveling and giving recs, this is perfect. Still needs some things worked out,   Like my profile picture and background photo do not load or show? probably a bug issue. Also I would love it if you were able to have a tab with a grid of all the photos you’ve took at locations, similar to Instagram, and the ability to change the main photo on your profile of trip locations. Otherwise great app can would love to see this grow | While I’m pretty proud of the state of my travel spreadsheets, this app blows them away. The social aspect, easily saving and sharing ideas with friends, make planning so much easier. | Pros:
+ GPS enabled search
+ Clean, intuitive functions
+ Collaborative space

Cons:
- does not map from location to location
- there’s no default view of a trip to show the entire itinerary, you have you click day by day 
- you can’t share trips to Instagram stories, there should be an attractive easy display for sharing on social media 
- there is no FAQ or feedback section in the app to suggest changes 
- you cannot make notes about a location or place you select for your trip, therefore I still prefer using notes over this app until it adds features

I am happy to use this app for an upcoming trip and will provide an updated review if the app features are updated. | I love this concept! The app is super easy to navigate and fun to use. I love logging all of the places I’ve been to, because it both helps give people I know recommendations, and it gives me a nice memory bank of where I’ve been. I used this to plan a recent trip, and it was such a neat way to keep track of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do. Love the map feature to see where in a city my friend’s recommendations are, and to find where my next stop is on vacation! | Love all the features so far. Genius idea!! When I’m planning trips, especially international trips, I use google maps to organize the itinerary based on location and proximity. I’m def gonna start inviting friends to join to make our lives easier. 
 For more effective itinerary planning, I would suggest adding the following:
1. Times
2. Option to add attachments, videos or images because some of the images don’t do these places justice)
3. Finally notes within scheduled places (as shown in the previews) and also notes to add activities that are not listed. 

I also love how the map shows the proximity of places to each other but is it possible to add a feature where we can see the actual distance from one place to another and perhaps driving directions? Currently, google maps only opens for directions to one place. | truly changes the game | Really great concept and I love the user friendliness. However, each time I try to see a list of someone’s recs on their page (or even my own), the recs do not load. The only way I can see recs is by searching a city right now. Needs an update probably

UPDATE: it works fine. This ^ was only happening for a few hours the first day. Really cool app! | Great for planning trips and sharing recommendations with friends! | It’s so awesome that you can put locations on the day you plan to visit but why not add time? It’s not a full function collaboration or trip planing tool if you can’t plan times in your day. | Cool app. Will definitely be using in future travels. Just wish there was an option to add your own photos and notes. Could possibly make this option private or public for others to see. | There are many things I love about this app. I just started using “plan my trip”.  
Not only am I adding all the places/ things I want to do as I prepare but this will also serve as a record for me for future,  Have u ever tried to remember that little restaurant you had stumbled across but couldn’t. Just park it here. | Love the app, such a great concept, very user friendly, and very great aesthetically. Just one thing- please make an update where you can make folders within each city of recommendations so that we can distinguish between food recs/activities/shopping, etc. Right now they are all in one category under each city and I’m afraid my recommendations will get lost in the sauce and get confusing if I keep adding to it! Would love a bit of organization and categories within each city. Thank you! | I’m already obsessed with the app as-is. It’s been. A very practical, helpful tool for trip research & planning - especially for group trips with friends or family. I don’t have a ton of friends on the app yet, so my planning process is still to go to Pinterest or travel blogs for ideas and then I save my wishlist things to do in Out of Office. If they keep building out additional features that make it more useful, building a user base I want to follow, and create more opportunities for engagement across users, this app will be an absolutely must have for anyone who enjoys a trip! | I love to see what friends and influencers that I follow are doing when they travel. Places to stay, eat, sights to see! I sometimes DM people and ask but this makes it so much easier especially when planning a trip and giving others recommendations. 10/10 recommend! | This is hands down one of the most beneficial travel apps I have ever used. For someone who loves to travel the reviews and recommendations have been spot on! Can’t wait to use the app on my next trip! | A user friendly interface that’s so easy to use! And because I trust my friends (and some influencers), it makes picking my hotel or restaurant so simple! Why didn’t someone think of this sooner?

As a host be ready to be a SLAVE for the AirBnB and their awful “rules”. They will fine you for whatever reason they like. Including for something that was THEIR fault! Long story. But I am a 5 star host and a 5 star guest. However I will cancel anything that has to do with AirBnB after my last guest leaves. Also be ready to not get paid a whole lot! Missing payouts, etc… If you have an actuall issue, a horrible incoherent robot “service” will reply. Is just OUT OF THIS WORLD god awful! Then if you are lucky to talk to a person, one person will not know what another one is doing. AWFUL! AirBnB, I am so, so, so, so done with you! And I will advise everyone I know to STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM YOU! | I am in Costa rica for vacation I rented a room after check in I found that no electricity and water most of the time. I asked Airbnb for a refund but they are not helpful at all and ignored my request. Next rent was a scam host, it was not even room was a camps I couldn’t sleep because the noise and very dirty, the issue Airbnb allow the hosts to re-listing again so the host keep removing the listing after bad reviews. Totally scam! We should try something else than airbnb! They stand with hostess!!! | When I arrived, I realized the neighborhood was unsafe, and the property was dirty despite the cleaning fee. Unable to stay, I contacted Airbnb for help, but they requested evidence while I was on my way. Meanwhile, there was an active shooting nearby. It's been over 30 hours since I've been trying to reach Airbnb with no solution. I paid $5k for the reservation. I later discovered multiple fatal crimes nearby through police reports. Despite contacting 7 customer service reps, none have resolved my case as they keep clocking out. Now, I'm waiting in my car for Airbnb to call back. It's been 27 hours since my initial claim. | The customer support team is trash. It sounds like the same person every time you call back they always tell you they can’t transfer you. None of them work consistently all of them have different work ethics I can’t transfer you to a supervisor they tell you and you randomly get blockedand your account can get suspended at any random moment | This compay provide its services inside the settlements which are built of stolen Palestinian land ! Boycott Airbnb | Airbnb is such a great idea. The owners made a great invention and have a strong presence in the hospitality industry. I love using the app and all communication from hosts to customer service representatives. Very professional and very helpful! | It won’t even let me book place to stay 😭 keeps saying error please try again how do you have a app that books places for people to stay and it doesn’t even let u use it🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️👿👿 | To be honest this app is average. When it comes to customer service AirBnB is abysmal! 

They outsource customer service to India, the support is slow, inarticulate, absolutely no help as they rely on their “specialists” whom you never directly converse with. 

I’m currently traveling and have been dealing with an issue with AirBnB that has gone unresolved for what now is going onto the 6th day - with x3 separate open tickets / claims with customer support. 

I’ve had to find and pay for premium accommodations as AirBnB provides no help beyond fake assurances and fake smiles. 

Proceed with caution when traveling abroad as they will leave you stranded on your own. 

Their is no way AirBnB will continue to dominate the space under this business model. | There are few if any protections for guests in the booking process. Hosts have the power to set ridiculous rules and choose exploitative policies that hurt guests most. Very difficult to plan group trips when hosts set arbitrary rules about visitors. Additionally, the refund/cancellation policy is nearly hidden until after you book and then you’re stuck in a bad deal. If Airbnb is supposed to be the better alternative to hotels, they need to at least put guests first. | Your support team has been little help and now me and my family don’t have a place to stay this weekend. We are doing some remodeling this weekend and will not have access to our utilities. We decided to go with Airbnb because I have a dog and not many hotels are pet friendly. They won’t let me book a place because of a “safety risk” that we might be having a party due to short notice. Why would I book last minute to book a party. I just want a place got my family while out home gets fixed. ZERO customer support, once I contacted them to try and resolve it the support lady simply read off a script that said summarizes to “to bad so sad” and “we sent it to the right team” . Might as well have AI answer their customer service | The hosting side of the app is terrible. Way too many issues. Booking as a guest is fine though never had any issues on that part | I have been a host for several years.  Generally good experience and the guests have been almost all wonderful.  However I did have one damage claim and got no cooperation or payment from AirBnB.  Very frustrating run around and very contrary to the assurances they give.  So just know you are on your own - they take the fees but do not support. | Trash app!! Don’t even let me book lol. | I love booking with Airbnb, it’s easy and has less fees than other sites! | First time using the Airbnb app.  We reserved an apartment located downtown San Antonio. Had great reviews, pictures looked good and a 4.9 on cleanliness. We arrive to our Airbnb and noticed the floor would creek pretty bad. There was dust everywhere. We found hair also in some places. The sofa was covered in stains & crumbs. There was a towel in the washer (only had a washer) the dishwasher was very dirty also the keurig, the bed sheets seem dirty too. It obviously looked like the place has not been cleaned in a while. We didn’t even stay for an hour there. I let the host know, also taking some pictures for evidence. I didn’t get every single thing because I thought the ones I did take were enough for anyone to tell this place was not cleaned. The host ends up telling it was cleaned that day and to send the pictures. He then told me I had to speak with Airbnb customer services because I asked for a refund. They end up telling me I can not get a refund because it was “minor cleanliness” and only cared if I had a picture of the towel in the washer but not the sofa that had stains all over.  I couldn’t even get a partial refund. Airbnb only cares about the host and will side with them even if they are in the wrong. THEY DELETED BAD REVIEWS ON THEIR APP. | They cared and fixed the issue that we had. | It used to be a good way to book reasonably priced accommodation these days you can book a hotel room for less😂 | The problem with AirBnb can be summed up by saying it could potentially ruin a vacation or save a vacation with many factor built in between. Firstly it’s layered as to who to blame.  First there are AirBnb policies and then there are hosts.  A hotel for example may clearly state the rules and allow rearranging travel because they have many rooms available.  Airbnb just has the one place you booked with a host who has options to rearrange, change, or refund.  Also those hosts aren’t necessarily great when it comes to customer service.  For example if you get sick and need to move a reservation around hotels and airlines are understanding.  Airbnb host might just take your money and run with no recourse other than a bad review.  Which AirBnb favors the host because you cannot sort by good or bad reviews.  It gives the average rating and then you have to sort through to find the bad reviews.  While I have experiences reasonable host who are accommodating.  I have also experienced a host who just took my money for no services rendered. This is the reason why I cease to use AirBnb ever again. | Love this app. If anything happens they take care of you! | This app is amazing I love looking at houses hotels and it is so relaxing to look at  when you are bored | Some of these hosts have the most insane cancellation policies found nowhere on earth - 50% refund if cancelled at any point in time, 100% upfront. Not only that, but you can’t even review the host after interacting with them. I will never use Airbnb again - see ya | Airbnb is the worst they will lock your account for no reason and the customer service doesn’t do anything to help time for them to revamp their company | Watched all the homeowners in my town use this to make more money by letting people stay in homes while the locals moved into hotels and cars. Kinda messed up and total waste of resources. God help us. | Hidden fees not shown until checkout. Other companies like booking.com and vrbo show the actual “price total” upfront on the map view. After cleaning fees, airbnb fees, and taxes, some listing totals double in price (which is insane anyways), so that should all be more visible when viewing map view. | The blocked me from booking at all because a comment I said celebrating me in my spouse alone for peace for his birthday they said it could lead to party’s so I’m not allowed to book any houses so I most definitely deleted this account you guys makes us leave comments then take the account away from your ai that can’t read correctly | Love the interface design. The best design in the industry. Just waiting for them to verify listing to weed out fake listings. It’s not that hard. They have the technology for it. I just don’t know why they don’t do it.

I also don’t like the fact that I cannot see what I made last year. 

I would like for them to show me what dates people like to view the most on my calendar. | This app is a mess. Try to search for a location then click on one…. Who knows where you end up. Date selection is a disaster. Even if you want a destination it always defaults back to “map view”. | Party house . I don’t know who’s renting this out to kids? Over 100
Kids at party in a family neighborhood. Cops
Called,Guns found. 100 kids running from cops at 1:30-2:00 Am .
Helicopter overhead .This in not acceptable in a family neighborhood. This needs to STOP! Please close this bnb | Trust me | You pay with real money, but when you cancel, they give you credits that you can’t even withdraw. It’s really disappointing how the costumer service can’t even solve an issue with the host. | After getting scammed by a host, airbnb sided with the scammer, threatened to cancel  account, and kept my money which is basically stealing. I spent an entire year complaining ti customer service, and they kept promising to fix the problem only to ghost me over and over again. | The app is over 200 MB | Todos los lugares que voy la uso | Price filter in app is nonfunctional. Ridiculous bug for an app like this. | We had one of the worst experiences using AirBnB with an absolutely terrible host and AirBnB was a joke to work with. They do not protect their customers over the hosts which allows the hosts to get away with dirty properties, false listings, etc. and there is nothing you can do about it. We won’t be booking with them again. | I am a superhost of a monthly rental. Unless someone selects monthly rental my house doesn’t pop up at all. There’s a yearly event near my house that lasts 3 weeks. Housing was low and going for very high rates, but unfortunately for me my house is sitting empty because Airbnb won’t show my house unless somebody specifically request a monthly rental or input dates that exceed a month why not homes that are available in the area that are not meeting the criteria so that someone can still click on your house and see why they don’t meet the criteria whether it’s unavailable dates or maybe they would change and add an additional weekend so that they can get housing in an area where housing is extremely limited now there are a bunch of people that need housing that never found my listing and I know I’m not the only one because I’m in real estate and I’ve had people calling me in the area that are having the same problem with Airbnb not showing their listing unless it’s over a monthly rental. Because of this, I’ve listed the house on the local MLS because now it’s sitting empty. Lost revenue for hosts, Airbnb, and also people that need housing won’t find it because it doesn’t show up. | I had a burglary in Walnut, CA while staying with Airbnb. The evidence and police report proved it’s previous tenant broke in with passcode (the Airbnb host never changes password). We have lost our bags and even a car. Although car has been recovered, it has a stolen record on carfax. Airbnb and host started ghosting us since then. Disgusting they couldn’t do anything and let users bear all the losses. | I have been a user of the platform for years. Never encountered a problem (probably my own good luck).  When an issue finally arose, I was met with silence, and then what I can only describe as an automated, generic massage from what seems like a robot. Shame on you the company for allowing customer service to get this way.  Taking my business elsewhere.. | Title: Great Concept, Disappointing Execution

I genuinely love the concept of Airbnb and the unique travel experiences it aims to offer. It's a fantastic idea that has the potential to transform how we experience new places. However, I am deeply disappointed with how the platform operates, particularly when it comes to customer service and its arbitrary process for handling disputes and bans.

During my last experience, I encountered serious issues that highlight these flaws. The customer service for guests was not only abysmal but also completely opaque, leaving me frustrated and without clear answers or support. Even more distressing was the arbitrary nature of how bans are issued. I had an ex who misused the platform to stalk me by pretending to be a neighbor and even escalated to calling the police on me, leading to my undeserved ban from the platform. This situation was handled poorly, with little to no investigation or consideration of context, which was incredibly disheartening.

Adding to the disappointment is Airbnb's lack of a loyalty program, which feels like a missed opportunity to reward frequent travelers. When faced with the choice between an often too-early 10 or 11 AM checkout at an Airbnb and the flexible 4 PM checkout that Marriott offers for Titanium members, the choice becomes increasingly clear. The lack of such benefits, which are standard among hotel loyalty programs, makes Airbnb less attractive in comparison.

While I remain a fan of what Airbnb aspires to be, these significant shortcomings make it difficult to trust and rely on their service. It’s regrettable because I truly appreciate the innovative approach to travel Airbnb promotes, but without improvements in transparency, fairness, and guest benefits, it’s hard to see myself using this service in the future. | I love Airbnb as a traveler and as a super host! The honest reviews and photos assure me especially when I travel alone that I know what to expect. Especially when it comes to other super host properties and the host themselves I know I’m getting the inside of local eats and things to do! | I’ve always used AIRBNB when I travel until recently. I stayed at an Airbnb in downtown LA during a trip. Knowing it was going to be shady finding parking plus the fact that I had rented a Porsche and wanted it garage, I immediately checked the “has parking” option as that was the most important thing to me. 

3 hours before I checked in, the “host” told me that I no longer had parking (I could no longer cancel at this point) he told me I would need to park a block away in an unsupervised lot and pay extra. He told me. Obviously this wasn’t okay, but I tend to let things go with the flow instead of cause a problem so I gave it a chance. Downtown LA is so unsafe and not only did this host lie to me and say it was in West Hollywood, it was a few blocks from skid row full of homeless people. The next day I found that someone had scratched my rented Porsche and was charged for the damage. After taking to I kid you not 10 different employees each asking me to explain my situation when they could have easily keep past conversations in file was sloppy. I spent a lot of money with Airbnb and all of it was a lie. I have no doubt the actual renter of the condo stored his own car in the spot he advertises for and hours before someone checks in, he cancels your spot.
I felt very unsafe walking a block to my Airbnb alone at 1am after meeting with friends when I expected to have a safe garage space. 

AIRBNB sided with their renter and I will never rent you airbnb again. Honestly hotels are now… better at least I know what I’m getting, VRBO is great as well. | This app is incredible but I am no longer getting notifications since the last few updates- which impacts me as a host! I have tried to fix it from the app, from my iPhone setting, uninstall, reinstall- nothing is working. It’s a huge flaw that impacts my experience! | One of my favorite apps ever. I appreciate how many features the host experience has yet still feels lightweight and straightforward. | This app is great if everything goes as planned. But if your place is dirty, with trash in the pool. You only get one day of pool heating even tho you paid for two. They don't help with anything. Our power even went out for an entire day with no explanation. Airbnb have no help. Told me to request my own money back from the host? That's just weird? They also just ended the conversation when I asked to talk to someone higher up and just kept telling me to figure it out on my own. | DO NOT book with Airbnb. If you are trying to save money by staying at an Airbnb instead of a hotel, STAY AT A HOTEL!! It is reliable, safe, and filled with real customer service people.

I have had plenty of good experiences with the platform until recently. After having to leave a booking due to unsafe property conditions, Airbnb did not provide a refund from the host. 

We requested reimbursement for our alternative housing and communicated with Airbnb customer service for 3 weeks straight. We sent them video and photo evidence via email multiple times and they continued to deny that they recieved anything. Every time we sent a message there was a different representative and it was entirely written by AI, with grammatical issues and repeated phrases expressing how ""sorry"" they were in many different ways. They would also call me at odd hours of the day/night. Lastly, they denied that we reported the concern in time and kept on requesting information that we had already provided. | Airbnb isn’t even worth using anymore due to the insane hidden fees. The cleaning fee basically doubles the price of the stay and there’s no way to see it while searching. | airbnb should understand that their platform became successful because host were using their platform. Travelers would go with the cheapest and most convenience place listed my property on Airbnb after one month customer service is horrible. They’re not trained and all they care about is closing the ticket. | Well, I have been with Airbnb for almost 10 years. But last year I stayed with a woman in Norway who was racist and nasty to my friends and I. She left me a ridiculous review and I tried to explain to Airbnb that I had 24 amazing reviews. And on February 5th, they deleted her comment finally. When I logged onto my account months later, I realized that the comment was miraculously back. I called and asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told no. And even though I asked over and over again why the comment was put back, they just said nothing. So I am done. I have heard from friends about Airbnb leaving them in unsafe circumstances and I should have quit at that point. This is just scary to me and Airbnb needs to change their way of doing business. But someone will need them and that will continue. | I had to cancel a reservation because there’s no elevator and it wasn’t specified on the listing. Airbnb refuses to give me my money back. Blatant violation of the American Disability Act. Nobody cares at customer support. Filing a dispute with my credit card company | Annoying and don’t upgrade.

We can easily pull up old trips to find our good memories along with data like cost, distance, how long we stayed….

Who could ask for anything more! | All the app does is display a map of your route. Pain to have to open computer to get more info when phone is always handy. No arrival or departure dates, no address of destination pin. Pretty much just a non functional picture. But the desktop part is great. | I like the idea but the map lacks detail… one of the reasons I don’t like Apple Maps.  Wish it would interstate with Google maps. I find that Google maps has more detail not just major highways. | App is not intuitive, gave up trying after 5min | Hard to use | I paid so I can save my trip and it is telling me I can not save my file.  Also, it does not auto-populate the addresses. | To think about what point you want to go from another point where you want to begin.
This one like the three others I tried make you start from where you are and want to track you where you progress.
I am flying somewhere else then driving from there. No pin drop allowed without exact address or data downloaded from something else. Planning not allowed.
Want 5 stars? Dumb it down and allow me to be smart. Allow me to just put pins in cities and towns and pick my path and once complete compute the distances and let me decide how far I want to go and drop pins in hotels and campgrounds and places to eat.

The app doesn’t recognize that I paid for it. So won’t save or route my trip, therefore useless to me. Apple App Store marks it paid for 
So bummed can’t get it to work | Tried to use the demos numerous times and kept crashing.

Contacted support and they said try a different browser-safari, no luck, Firefox, no luck, Chrome, no luck on either my iPhone or IPAD.

I’ve tried to set up a password for the subscription I paid for- link doesn’t work.

I’m going to have to send an email to technical support just to cancel the subscription I signed up for. | Not user friendly! | After I bought the paid version, it works really well. The developer seems like he’s tired of hearing about how his free version doesn’t work. | Very difficult to figure out how to use. Haven’t programmed a trip yet?! | Can’t map a very common route | I was trying to figure out routes that can be taken driving across country and it’s not very good at explaining how the app works | It doesn’t know all zip codes when searching location by zip code only.

There response was feel free to hit the cancel button ??

Why ask for a review the second you download it | I haven’t the faintest idea of what this app does! | Deceptive way to force you to purchase. Should have allowed saving with few pins so that we can see how it works. Developer responses are just rude, lacks compassion to understand basic feedback | I’ve spent a lot of time searching for a trip planner, this one is beyond my expectations.
The tutorial is just the get started guide.

I’m traveling full time in our 5th wheel trailer. I downloaded this app after starting this seasons trip. Many of the features available were not in the tutorial but in the sample, so don’t forget to check it out. 
When entering dates and times I found the travel time was added in the data. 

One of the best parts in this app is the ability to edit the errors easily.

Bottom line I’m loving it! | I downloaded the app for the elevation feature that is advertised but foe the life of me I can’t figure out how to access it. I wrote to “support “ and all they did was refer me to the online help page which only says that the elevation chart is very handy but don’t show how to access it!
So far this app doesn’t appear to be what it claims. | Fails to advise you can’t save your trip unless you save. Bait and switch. | App doesn’t work. Help is non existent unless you join a google group, but the email address to join does not show in the directions. Created a .GPX on my computer (round trip from Ks to MA, with hotel, dates info). Tried opening file in RTP, brought in 25000 POI pins, didn’t recognize my route, no hotel info. Very dissatisfied. | Before you can even plan a trip, you have to buy the app unless you want unsaved edits. Total rip-off. | Nothing seems to work.

Can’t edit pin names 

Can’t share contacts | First let me say I’ve been using computers for a very long time and I can generally figure things out pretty quickly using the trial and error approach.  Appreciated being able to try a free version before buying the full version.  So I started with trial and error and soon realized that wasn’t working for me.  No problem, I’ll use the tutorial. Swiped through the examples and thought “cool” this is easy. So, started a pretend trip, which should have been pretty easy. Home to 2 poi to home.  Got the home in.  Even got the first location in.  Couldn’t figure out how to add the second location because the + sign wouldn’t come up again.  Back to the tutorial.  Went through that again.  Started over.  Same issues.  Played with it for about an hour or so and finally decided to move on.  

I agree with the person who commented about Streets and Trips, not because I’m looking to go back to a pc but for its functions and ease of use.  The developers snarky comment to a helpful suggestion from a customer told me all I needed to know. | Not clear how to use it to plot a trip | This has the potential of being a great app, but as is, its mostly just frustrating. I have yet to figure out how to delete a pin once it’s placed without deleting the entire file and starting all over. 
There also does not appear to be a search function in HELP.  If there is and I’m missing it, that’s just more evidence of being non-user friendly.  The developers would do themselves a huge favor to study Microsoft Streets and Trips for useful features and intuitive user interface. | Have not had the pleasure but hope this review gets me to the down load | I don’t see why this is any more useful than maps. There are no features that allow you to set a destination and plan a multi-day roadtrip, by setting the destination and adding legs of the journey while looking at the entire route and seeing pois on the way. You have to know where you want to stop ahead of time and that can be mapped with google or safari maps. Or maybe you can do that but it isn’t user friendly then. | Have to purchase | I have been using this app for a couple of years now. 24 National Parks and counting. I pick an ultimate destination and edit stopping points along the way. I try not to drive more then 3 to 4 hours between stop overs. This allows me to see the routes and time travels. I can insert new POI/destinations and edit the pins to reroute accordingly. I am not to techie,so probably don’t get the most out of apps? But I believe that free apps are just that and no one makes stuff for free. Always room for improvement, but time cost money and programmers aren’t free. | You will waste more money by wasting time with this app. Not worth it | I have not downloaded the app yet but reading the comments from the developers responses is entertaining. Not very customer service friendly responsive.someone gave a good review but the app developer reply’s with instructions. I am gonna try this app but mainly because the app developer response is entertaining. Lol BTW the excuse that nothing can be done about how Apple maps work is not valid as you can as a developer use your own mapping tools you don’t have to piggy back off apples map app that is a choice. Just FYI

Update:
So trying out the app so far found many issues with it. Even though this is a basic free version it should give you the ideal how the app functions. As I am gonna try it first before buying the full version. When searching a spot it doesn’t actually go to where your search is just the general area. Also the search list shows a list of places that match the search which is good however it’s pointless if you can’t scroll down and look through that list. Other things wrong with it is it isn’t user friendly. I am a tech guy and know my way around an app. I can see how people will have issue using it. This is not the case to be blamed on Apple as this is your App and you control how well it functions 100% app developer. It also does not seem to have a feature to plan the trip in advance as I see no option to adjust the date | Crappy app | This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen! Way too difficult | Downloaded and before I can even start they let you know that none of your entries or changes will be saved unless you purchase the “other app.” It’s a waste of time and a trap.

I travel a lot for work, and the job requires that I plan, record, and retroactively access my notes.  There are so many plus points to this app that it’s hard to know where to begin.  Autopopulates pertinent info about locations?  Yes.  Easy to reshuffle appointments on the fly?  Yes.  Easy to collaborate with others on itineraries?  YES.  Web version that synchs with the app?  So much yes.  Downloadable itinerary WITH my notes in a PDF?  Talk dirty to me!  But really, like anything else, there’s room for improvements, but the developers are awesome with feedback and continually making it better.  This is the app you want, and if you’re the kind of person who travels enough to need this app, then you won’t think twice about the subscription.  You’ll never look back. | I plan trips in great detail. I just finished planning a two week trip using this app and am very excited to try it out. I used Inspirock for years and when it was discontinued this was the only website/app that came close.

What I would like to see:
- there is no connection to Google maps to calculate drive times. I had to manually do that myself. 
- Would be nice if it told me how much time I needed between activities so I would know how much time to spend there. Like for example I picked a hike to do and gave myself an hour. Further research showed me it was a 4 hr hike. That info could be datamined from other websites. Or added to the interface. 
- no suggested activities like on wanderlog or triphobo. I had to search for my own activities and put them in. I always search for hidden gems and that’s one feature I loved from Inspirock to help me avoid the crowds.
- would be nice to see my notes in the list view.
- would be nice to have a calendar view. If you add the drive times from Google maps and put it on a calendar you could see when your times may overlap. That’s kind of what list view does but when you see things on a calendar it’s so much easier to organize. I kept adding times and forgetting to switch things to PM. Also having a calendar with a notification of how much free time would help me pick and choose activities.

But it has major upsides:
- the interface and the flow on the app and webpage is easy to put all my stops in order. I love, love the cards. 
- I like how everything is laid out in order, how you can add times, add pictures to remind yourself what you are looking to visit, add the hotels, the driving time, and everything is neat and orderly.
- almost everything is customizable. That’s a huge plus. 
- I love the trip summary. It’s like a giant welcome page. 

I think as more features get added this is probably going to be a very popular app. | Often these travel planner apps have good features but look boring. This app looks great too. | I lke that you can add your vacation costs. Neat idea. | Easy to use trip organizer. Recommend it if you like to plan your own travels. | My vacations are so organized now. I feel like a pro!! | I used the web app for my honeymoon, and it made the trip planning process so easy. I used the iPhone app when I was on the trip and it was awesome. | The free version is good. Probably upgrade for longer vacations. | If you are a traveler on a budget, this travel planner app is a lifesaver. | This vacation planner is so easy to use and actually looks good. Would be even better if it forwarded emails directly into the app. | With this vacation planner app I actually enjoy trip planning. I recently started using the web platform too which is just as good. | I am impressed by the capabilities of this travel planner app. A big upgrade to the other trip planner app I used previously. The trip budget calculator is super useful. | With easy to use features and tools to manage travel expenses, it's a must-have for any traveler. | Travel budget section is so good. | Pleased I found this app. That says it all. | Ensures I stick to my vacation budget which I needed. It literally breaks all your spending into categories which is pretty cool and really helpful. | Really well designed trip planner. | I have never been so organized on my trips! | I rely on this travel planner app for all my trips now. Really good app. Highly recommend tripmapper. | I was skeptical about using a travel organizer, but this app proved me wrong. Highly recommend. | Tripmapper's itinerary app has been a game changer for us. Love the look of the app, that you can collaborate, the file uploads, the vacation budget calculator and the flights tracker. | A good vacation planner. | For anyone who loves planning trips, this travel planner app is great. It is user friendly and helps you manage your travel budget. | Making it easy to create itineraries and manage your travel budget. It would be cool if you could book things in the app too. If it did that it would get 5 stars from me. | Essential trip organizer for travelers who plan their own trips. | They have made this app even better with the new flight functionality. Wonder what they will do next! | If you love to create your own itineraries, TripMapper is the app for you. Have planned 5 trips now and will not be without it now! | Impressive customer service. Tried out their new flight feature which is in beta. Of the 4 flights I added to my itinerary, one could not be found. I contacted them in the app and they responded with a fix surprisingly quickly. | Overall, TripMapper stands out compared to other travel itinerary apps I've used. Best designed travel planner in my view and is easy to navigate. | Great cost tracking calculator! Has made a real difference to keeping my spending in check before and during my adventures. | Recommend this app for trip planning. Worth paying for the subscription. | Very good app. They seem to thought of everything! Attaching booking, finding your flights, adding reminders, a filterable map and expenses tracking. They even have the ability to covert the itinerary into a PDF too. | An app that nails group trip planning! | Good app. I would love them to add directions functionality. | I'm really impressed with the budget calculator. | As someone not very tech-savvy, I found the app really easy to use. | I planned a multi-city Europe trip using TripMapper, and it made organizing and coordinating it so easy. Also loved that I could add all my flights (the flight route map looks really cool). | Kudos to TripMapper. They ask for feedback and actually seem to action it. Impressive app. | I have tried 2 other travel planner apps and this one is my favourite. I love the layout, particularly list view. They have a web app too, so I can access my itinerary on my laptop too. | The overall experience so far is really positive. | The collaboration feature is top-notch. This app is a must-have for anyone planning a trip with friends. | Love the design of this app. So easy to use. | I can't imagine planning my trips without TripMapper now. It has made planning my trips so much easier. Highly recommend. | On Free Version Only for now. 

This app is phenomenal and checks many of my boxes for trip planning. 

I use card walls for work and the organization of this for trip planning just makes sense. Seeing my plans laid out, with budgets and color coded cards for different activity types is a great way to see how things should go. I am itching to get the paid version to be able to utilize maps and view my trips that way and many other features. 

The app is smooth, easy to use, fast, responsive, and well designed. The team is great, upbeat and has been super personable and responsive on social media and feedback surveys. They are putting out updates with asked for features and growing a fantastic app organically. 

Sofia - Uncultured Palate | I got this app because I'm an obsessive list maker and have a trip coming up. I wanted to jot down the places we'd be going, costs, and schedule it out. This app does that and converts the currency real time. I'm so very impressed with and thoroughly enjoy this app. The only fix to suggest would be moveable pins in mapping. A location I wanted mapped was Eiffel Tower, for example. No matter how many ways I typed it in, it would drop the pin on the side street instead of on the monument. Side streets can be actual destinations so I don't want confusion. Had to instead use ""les boutiques officielles de la tour Eiffel"" to get close. But the app even separates the expenses into categories! Five stars for being user-friendly, intuitive, and offering the printable list. | Where’s the iPad version? I’ve downloaded and it works with the iPad but it’s the screen size of an iphone. For that I will give it a 3 star. | I started experiencing a bug with the app which I wrote a review about that I have since deleted, as the support team were super quick to reply to my comment and also fix the issue. It’s always great to have a responsive support experience. 

The app has since been running smoothly, and is such a great simple tool for planning trips to every detail. If you’re an over-planner like me, this app is great. | This app is awesome, but the US time function doesn’t work.  All times are shown as AM no matter what. At first, I thought “oh maybe it’s military time”, but the app doesn’t recognize those times either.  So, my itinerary has Handgliding @4am…",4.69643,56,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7c/3d/a0/7c3da0ea-f57f-2fac-edfc-5f62980d761a/89ce8675-56e1-4ebb-ae28-3610744946c5_Impact.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6f/f5/73/6ff5733c-5a34-e2a7-e088-e52f5dc92d1e/562491b4-19a9-45d8-929f-08579003b499_Home.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/63/21/0a/63210a0e-c105-5d78-8190-2f9a37381be5/3ac69ce8-0880-4744-9d09-7fa00e676a5c_Card_View.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/63/f5/08/63f5088c-99e2-3a98-f64b-44a8db6f3e70/01a72299-7f33-4e93-8f34-9e39112c4355_Card.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/b5/76/d1/b576d131-80a4-e220-d2f0-508093790ad3/80799e0d-8c06-417e-8709-229bee802736_List_View.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/dc/1d/9f/dc1d9ffe-8547-bf46-f5fe-a240b9629c63/95a2dffc-f40b-4007-b388-b5a9c8b1234f_Map_View.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/4d/5d/d7/4d5dd7af-bb57-de84-779e-9b3f70ed775a/908f3d20-0f23-45dd-8aa3-ed11f0edad90_Budget.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b8/6c/60/b86c60c1-8af7-1cc2-9bec-7622a1dea645/1a4f500c-cdc6-4c39-9437-ee9b2d904b61_Overview.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

)0( %€ •…! | 1 star | This Chinese company took 10x the money for me to go to the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. They pretended to be American and were full of guarantees. They promised everything would be great but in their own system I bought two tickets and they’re “provider” sent only one. So you know what happened? We traveled all the way to Japan for that one thing schedule-wise and they ruined the whole thing. But they denied the issue until they checked their own Japanese voucher. But customer service never even trusted me I got this from the Lawson in Japan. Use at your own risk it should be banned in the US. My daughter and I missed what was her most important experience to have in Japan. | My partner and I booked a boat tour for 4.24 at 3pm. The operator changed time to 11am which we moved other plans around to accommodate. The instructions on where to meet were poor and confusing. We ended up at another dock #2 as there are two labeled that way at the marina. We spent additional money to get a water taxi to make it to the other side of the marina in time to catch our tour. We communicated while we were trying to get there and they ignored us. When arrived hey had left and refused to speak to us at all. I reached out to the get your guide support chat for help and or a refund and didn’t even get a response after being told to hold on for a few minutes by two different reps. They never came back to the chat and sent emails saying the operator informed them of our cancellation request which we never requested. No one from the app has responded or helped in any way, clearly so a refund doesn’t have to be given. We will never do business again and we will make our experience known publicly and will work with our bank to recoup what was paid. This is clearly a scam. | Use it!! | I booked an experience through this app and I unfortunately wasn’t able to do this experience because the check in process was so long and I was pushing my reservation back and I had already drove an hour and 30 minutes to this experience and I wasn’t able to start an hour later because I had other reservations that day. I tried to get a refund from the host of the experience but they told me to contact “GET YOUR GUIDE” for a refund. I contacted them immediately and told them what happened and they didn’t care they all just wanted to keep the $222 I had spent on something I didn’t even get to do. I wouldn’t have drove and hour and 30 min just to say I wanted a refund. I actually wanted to do it but I wasn’t able to. Get your guide and the experience host just wanted to keep the money. They didn’t care at all. I’m extremely disappointed by this since I use get your guide for all my travel. Beware they don’t care about you just want your money. | The app is fine, but you can’t trust what they say they will provide and stand behind that. Case in point, I booked a day trip from Amsterdam to Brussels. Flew from Boston to Amsterdam for 1 week The trip to Brussels was going to be the highlight of my week.
I made these plans months in advance. The evening before the day for trip I got an email stating the trip was cancelled, just stating not enough participants. I feel like, I gave them months of notice they gave me 1/2 day.
Don’t trust them with your money and the promise of a good time, they won’t keep it | I recently had a dreadful experience with the GetYourGuide app that left me utterly frustrated and disappointed. Despite booking a popular large group tour in Rome several weeks in advance, I inadvertently booked the same tour again for the same day the day before the tour was set to begin. Shockingly, the app failed to notify me of this duplicate booking. Upon realizing my mistake, I immediately attempted to cancel one of the bookings, only to find out that I couldn’t because the tour was less than 24 hours away.

Customer service was an absolute nightmare. Despite numerous emails and interactions with different agents, they all robotically regurgitated the same excuse: “rules are rules.” It’s clear their primary concern is protecting their own interests, even at the expense of customer satisfaction. They shamelessly lied to me about the possibility of a refund, claiming the tour provider wouldn’t cooperate, only to be exposed when I reached out to the actual agency and received a prompt and courteous refund directly from them.

It’s evident that GetYourGuide’s customer service is severely lacking, with a dismissive attitude that suggests they believe their dominance in the market exempts them from providing quality assistance. Save yourself the headache and use alternative platforms like Booking, Airbnb, TripAdvisor, Klook, or any other service that actually values its customers. Trust me, it’s not worth the hassle. | This app turned out to be the best part of planning a 3 day sightseeing trip in Berlin. I was tagging on a few adventures after a work trip, and the suggestions of what to do were super helpful, booking was easy, the app worked great - just scanned QR codes for all of our tickets, nice reminders, and the maps for meeting points made it so easy to figure out where we were supposed to go. Other traveler reviews were also really helpful. Top notch, totally recommend to make your trip easy and meaningful. | Very frustrating to be solicited to sign up and be told a promo code would be sent and it isn’t sent by email. Had to download the app just to chat with someone. Not cool. They don’t offer military discount which is bogus. Something that should take 10 min to do took me over an hour. | I would have liked to book entry directly, but since I couldn’t, it worked well to get the entry through GYG. | Genial el plan súper recomendado | Get Your Guide is great! Never been disappointed! | I have used this app to help me with planning activities through my numerous trips around the world and it has been very useful!  I highly recommend! | Buy now pay later option is great. It’s easy to use and find things to do no matter where you go, and canceling is easy. | In the iPhone App, it states that you can get on the Hop-on/Hop-off at any stop using the iPhone App. After making payment, the email
Says that you have to go to their office to print a voucher. So in other words, we have to take a taxi to their office from the cruise ship, then a taxi back to the attraction we have booked separately in order to Hop-on Bus! This completely defeats the purpose of buying Bus tour. When you call them, they make up a million excuses, and won’t let you speak to a supervisor. They also have problem with their app not accepting credit cards, and blame the customer. | This was probably the best tour I have ever had. WIDi was very knowledgeable and nice - he answered all my questions and made the experience unique and tailored to my interests. I particularly enjoyed every bit with him through the village and waterfalls feeling like a local. all the tour was great and l highly recommend it. WIDI thank you so much for your time. | We took a self-guided audio tour of Charlotte, NC because we didn’t really know any history of the city.  The tour was great!  We were able to start when we wanted and go at our own pace, stopping if we needed to - such as stopping to get a couple souvenirs at a cute little shop, that we likely would not have found without this tour!  We look forward to using this type of tour on our future trips! | You are the worst company I ever dealt with you are a bunch of thieves | Our tour to the lower antelope is very exciting. Our tour guide Dylan A. answered questions, instructed us how to take beautiful photos in antelope. Very good tour guide! | Planned a trip for NYC and this app was a great tool to use to book experiences. It made the planning so easy. Very easy to navigate and the check ins were seemless. | Was not what was expecting at all.  Thought this would be a self-guided walking tour, but instead just the info on sight-seeing spots.   Now the info was good if that’s all you are looking for-you will enjoy this app.   But I was expecting a path route to guide me through the various points of interest.

Also, spent at least 2 hours with representative trying to figure out my redemption code.   Being I thought this was a path route experience, I dealt with this- otherwise would have washed my hands of this app after 5min. | Enjoyed the ride and the stories told by our guide Jeffery! | We arrived late and missed a ticket but they gave us a another  ticket | I tried cancelling cause family sickness and they asked for doctor paperwork while I’m in a foreign country , not even visiting hospital . I lost on over 150$ . These guys not considerate at all ! DO NOT DOWNLOAD , better off using another app! | Excelente aplicación. Un día que se me canceló la actividad me hicieron mi reembolso sin problema. Son respondables y confiables. Lo único es que a veces te sale más económico contratar localmente. | We have used Viator and Trip Advisor in the past (both work great) but Get Your Guide has so many tours/activities at a great price and they are so easy to communicate/make adjustments with. Definitely our go-to tour app now. | This was an amazing experience! We learned so much about the culture and importance of the area thank to our amazing guide! He had perfect English so us monolinguals were very grateful for it. Our transportation from Arles was easy and fun. We stopped in a few locations that allowed us to see the bulls, horses and flamingos. I highly recommend this experience. | The customer service center does not have all the information about the booking readily available. The telemarketers do not have access to decision making options and block access to supervisors. Management of the telemarketing center is terrible. 
Be mindful of cancellation policies because you can loose money easily. | A fun and filling activity, the Trastevere walking food tour is a great way to sample  the local food, engage with other tourists, and learn some fun facts regarding the culinary delights of Trastevere. Our guide, Karina, was amazing. She was witty, enthusiastic, and very informative. I highly recommend this tour. | It is very basic. Be on time!! They won’t let you in late!!! | Go away app nobody wants you I just want my tickets | Just downloaded the audio tour and excited to see and listen to the history of Palm Springs. | I would definitely recommend you stay away from this company. We took a day trip up from Paris to enjoy this boat excursion. We arrived to a text message that said they’d cancelled. Buyer beware | Get Your Guide,

   This is my first time using your company and my booking was cancelled. I usually use Viator exclusively. The booking was cancelled due to weather. I have checked the weather there is no inclement weather in the forecast and other companies are still fulfilling their tours. That’s beside the point. Clearly something is wrong or broken at Get Your Guide. My biggest issue is that you quickly processed my payment but when you cancel it can take up to 14 days for a refund. If you need capital as a company just say that. Don’t take my money then cancel for fraudulent reasons and then make the consumer wait for a refund two weeks. Bad business. I will never use Get Your Guide again. | Worst walking tour I’ve ever been on. 12 of us were wandering around the area trying to find our guide. Location is not accurate. Tried calling the number on the site. Did not work. Tried chatting through the app, and they said they were experiencing high volume of calls, and could not respond. When our guide did arrive, it was hard to hear them as we walked around. Did not know the history, nor knowledgeable on the subject matter to answer our questions. Poor experience, bad tour, waste of money. | We went to Hawaii last year and used get your guide for 3 fantastic excursions. Everything was as described and we had no issues whatsoever. Our experience was so good that this trip to Florida we are booking more excursions. I am hoping all goes as well as it did in Hawaii. I’m not sure if you can get better deals by waiting to book when there, but knowing we have everything booked already is worth any extra expense if there even is one. This app takes you to many destinations, it’s easy to use and like I said so far everything was just as expected. We’re not that tech savvy yet still was an easy experience. There are multiple payment options and it says you can cancel up to the day before if your plans change, so why not book and have your vacation plans well in order. | This company is very professional and their tour guide truly enjoys his job and was very helpful and showed us exactly where we needed to go to see the most scenery on the reef in Fort Lauderdale. if you want to do something exciting that you’ve never done before and walk away amazed… then you should do the Seabob excursion through this company. You won’t regret it! | This app is easy to use. I booked excursions to see things we probably would not have seen if we didn’t use the app. I plan on using this app on all my trips. | I never leave reviews on apps but me and along with the other plenty negative reviews, I would strongly agree you DONT use this app. Communication was awful and the itinerary was not correct. The only positive thing I can say is that the customer service was great when I was getting a refund! | It was nice to see how to make French bread and croissants. Stuff was friendly. Unfortunately we didn’t receive bag with goodies to go as it’s said in description. However, we still got one piece of bread per family before we left. It was informative to know a some history of croissants. | Should have recd the tickets a week before instead of the day of | Guide said there is a “message“ ,  nope.  Can’t reach guide. Maps are not accurate.  Refund apparently takes 3-5 business days, but billing is immediate. | I don’t recommend using this method for booking your activities!
I planned a day trip to Key West for the snorkeling trip, our activities were canceled due to mechanical issues with their transportation! 
I was told I would get a full refund I never received it when I contacted the company they offered me $400 back out of a event I paid over $600 for!
I was there on time with my two kids. There was no fault on my end. Why I cannot take my children for the snorkeling event in Key West. It was all on their end so I should get a full refund. Don’t waste your money with this company! | I did no planning until I arrived and was able to find activities at a great price last minute. 

Mucho Graci | This app has been so helpful on all of my trips abroad. I love the ease of booking and having so many options available. There is literally something for everyone! Sometimes the app is more expensive than other avenues of ticket purchasing, but again, the app is just easier to pull up purchases and tickets. However, the meeting points of some tours are difficult to find and unclear. Also, customer service is horrible to deal with. I accidentally double-booked a tour 5 days in advance bc the app wasn’t working properly. It took a half hour to fix and the person I spoke with was not super nice, told me I was wrong, there was a language barrier and I had to repeat the number 4 times. | Update your dirctions to the dock. What is posted there is not realistic RiverRoaf is block there are numerous new structures between the dock and the aquarium | Last year, my husband and I went on our 20th anniversary trip ton Spain, Portugal, Morocco, & Gibraltar. Get Your Guide was a great app to use in planning some of the places we wanted to see. Purchasing tickets for tours or points of interest was easy and the cancellation policy is very good. We had one place we had to cancel because of time constraints and we got a full refund because we cancelled within the time frame they mentioned. I also like the fact that tickets are stored in the app or you can download it to your phone and since we have iPhones, all our tickets were stored in Apple wallet so it was safe and secure and hassle free as we didn’t have to print physical copies. Also the freedom of not having to get in line to buy tickets is another bonus. We visited the Tile museum in Lisbon and the tickets were for the same day and entrance is at anytime so that helped us plan our day and we were able to take our time at all the places we visited. | Paid €180 and never received tickets.

Travel apps are fun, and there are many many others that don’t do this. Choose a different one. | Can you please make the country flag size bigger. | I have never wrote a review EVER… but this may be the WORST app I have ever gotten in my life. Very frustrating to work. I LITERALLY had to type where I lived over 5 times. I could not get passed it no matter what. I just want a simple app that tracks the places I’ve been. Do NOT DOWNLOAD. | Nothing saves when I put it into the app. I emailed them months ago no response. Waste of money and I would like it back | Just keeps asking me what country I live in and what city. When hit next, it asks the same question. It’s an endless loop. | You have to pay the monthly subscription fee to even add the places you’ve been. | This app is great for travel and aspirational travel planning. Lots of cool features, I ended up paying for the full package. Tech support was fast and helpful when I had an issue. | Love this app! I just wish it had some better options and visuals for sharing maps and progress with friends and on social media. | The best thing about this App is that the owner actually responds to multiple request to add cities!  Easy and fun way to track my visits to 54 countries to date…. Including many non-tourist destinations. | It used to be you zoom in and see the subdivisions of the country. They got rid of that and now you have to click the country, then click a few other things. Nowhere near as seamless. Please bring the old functionality back! | The site keeps asking me to update where I live and won’t do anything else. | I have fun marking off places I have visited and being able to see my progress.  Also, the developers are great, as I have provided feedback and content and the team updates the app as needed.  Great job! | How is possible that you has to agree to receive thousands of emails that you don’t want to use the app? Plus has to pay extra for add remove but no email scam chain? Blame on you. | Sorry, if I can’t even try the app without signing up for an email list, it is a non-starter. I should not be required to sign up for marketing junk mail before I even know if I like the app. If this gets fixed/changed then maybe I could give a better rating. | I have been traveling a lot in recent years & decided I wanted to start logging locations. This was the 2nd app I decided to try, but I couldn’t even get past the set up because it required me to choose my home city off a list that didn’t contain my home city. It did not offer any way to manually enter my home city, and no way to bypass that selection. So, needless to say, I deleted the app. | Recommend multiple family profiles so kids are encouraged to discover as much/more as their parents | The app doesn’t load | This app looks so cool, but when I try to sign up, there is an error that pops up on the screen. I used different emails too. I don’t know what’s wrong!

EDIT: The app is super helpful. The customer support was amazing. Thank you! | Well I’d like to review this app for its features or literally anything but I can’t even use it. I try to make an account and it won’t get off the loading screen. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times. | Loved this app. But won’t load since the update yesterday! | I had been using this app and enjoyed it, but logged in today to a screen asking me to agree to a privacy policy. There was an additional checkbox asking permission for the app to send me promotional mail. I left it unchecked and submitted and was greeted with “Whoops! You must accept everything or delete your account. The two buttons to proceed were literally “ok” and “delete account”. I didn’t say ok. How insulting | Buggy. I downloaded this app and after 15 minutes of trying to see the scratched countries, I gave up. All I could see was a yellow dot where I live. I changed the water color and the whole map changed to that color except for the yellow dot. Waste of time. | Got this app to log the places I’ve traveled to and even bought the almost $10 packet which includes no ads, unlocks cities, regions etc., of where you’ve traveled. However, every time I wanted to save a city for example in Mexico, I wanted to log Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Tulum.. it would not save no matter how many times I pressed the BEEN button. Even restarted my phone to make sure the issue was not on my end.

Please fix this! | I liked the app but even after you pay to get rid of the ads they force you to subscribe to advertising email list.  It’s either subscribe or delete your account, the only options, I deleted my account t.  I got fooled. | Seriously? 8.99 for this? You can not even exporta decent picture of where you have been in the map. | Useless if you’ve only traveled domestically. | I’ve tried multiple times, and even deleted the app, reinstalled it, and still no luck. | Get ready to be spammed. They sell your email and all sorts of weird malicious spam starts reaching out to you | This is a good way to keep track of world travels. It works great. | Just trying to record countries visited not give you all my info. Ugh. | So it good with the countries. I was trying to update cities I been and lived and it would let me add. It only updates countries. It also isn’t user friendly. I have to re-teach myself how to reset the city I currently live (still not accurate on my app). Also, something I can get over if the city updates work, is it has plenty of Territories as separate counties which love, but it picks and chooses which ones (such as Canadian territories not being separated from the country) and it also doesn’t acknowledge all disputed territory very well. For example Morocco on it’s map has territory that isn’t part of it, it is UN accurate, but if your going UN accurate, then a territories shouldn’t be separate. So Puerto Rico is part of the United States and not independent. I do prefer that it separates it. But I am annoyed that it picks and chooses for you who owns what land. To be honest I wouldn’t have even cared about most of this if the upgrades I paid for actually worked. | Have to enter cities and countries twice. For example; entering city as Barcelona in Spain won’t show Spain as a country visited. You must enter the country as a different entry. Not worth $8 or anything. A waste. | The app itself is fine. But to use it you must accept terms that you accept unlimited spam from them and their partners. There are other apps that don’t do that. There are plenty of websites that do not for free. | This app REQUIRES you to sign up and forces subscription (says you can op-out at anytime).

You can NOT op-out.  Apple should remove this app as a scam to customers. | I downloaded the app because it also has the list of places, food, capitals, parks, etc.  Unfortunately, the app is missing the option to filter searches. When searching for cities in the US, it shows a list of all the cities in alphabetical order and not by state - it would’ve been convenient to filter the cities by state in addition to having a search. Also, when selecting the destinations visited under the list tab, it does not filter lista by “been” or “want to visit”. | This is a good app and I even paid to remove ads and to unlock all the features. HOWEVER, it needs to give more control to the user. They collect so much of your personal information. It’s like either use it and let us collect these information, or leave it. Also, I was forced to sign up to their newsletter. It said I can withdraw from their newsletter at anytime but there is no option for that in the map. I paid for the premium features but you know what? Don’t. None of the premium features were worth it. Let me start off by cities. You can type and choose the cities that you’ve been to and cities that you want to visit. But that is it. You can’t even see a list of those cities that you want to visit, let alone a map of it. Looks like they made it easy for them to collect our information. Inspiration doesn’t have anything. It said it would show travel photos. The only photo it shows is the thumbnail when you select from want/been. If you do download this app, please do go to privacy section and read the “What personal information do we collect?” Section. So far, what a waste of money it has been. If it gets improved, I will update my review. | After you setup your account, the app requires you to both (1) accept their privacy policy and (2) agree to receive marketing emails from them. If you do not do both, it offers a “Delete Account” option. If you choose that, it then tries to charge you $2.99, rather than simply deleting your data. | Absolutely cool, only one issue though; There should be an option for the places you have lived and where you are currently living to be different. | Be prepared to pay $8.99 the ONLY feature you get for free is to select your countries visited. All other content is to be paid for. There are tons of apps out there for free that will give you that. Save your money. | Can I change the email address associated with my account? | I love this app bec it lets me track the places I have been and gives me stats on the travel I have done ! | Love the app except for 1 part. It doesn’t show the different countries for the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are all separate countries and should be counted as such. | App is trash and waste of time | The app seemed interesting. I downloaded it, installed it launched it. First thing that comes up it  asks for your email. App immediately uninstalled. When will developers learn that people don’t want to be violated to use their app? | X

It's not working properly. The system does not work when you want to take a around tiket entrance turn. | When I put a destination into the app for a certain date then click ‘find tickets’ it brings me outside of the app to the website and changes the date. So I can’t figure out how to buy my tickets | Impressed it knows much of the bus and ferry schedules but not all options are provided. It leaves out toll bridge costs in the estimate for driving around or the multiple options for walking on a ferry / taking a car on the ferry, so only one option is available on the other side: the bus route and not driving. There are also various different ferries to take and those options aren't given for comparison, either because it is inefficient or unknown; I don’t know. | Helped me find the best means of travel, train schedules and even the ability to buy tickets.  Highly recommend | Traveling to Spain in May and was checking out some different travel options and when I went to choose a date, for example, May 27, 2023  it would populate June 27,2023. But when I choose April 27, 2023, then it populated May 27, 2023. It’s a month ahead. | I’ve used Rio when in large cities to navigate public transportation (New York & Paris so far), and have not needed to reference the public transportation maps. 
Only suggestion - I have been hesitant to get on a bus on the street not knowing if they require exact change, or, can I use a credit card?  Especially when I don’t speak the language.  The app is fabulous already, but adding payment type would really assist ease-of-use for those of us not wanting to possibly make an embarrassing scene (confirming the ugly American perception). | First result for a hotel search in Florence Italy was a hotel in Paris.  When I clicked on other results nothing came back just their version of a spinning wheel.  Not taking this to Europe with me. | I am in London quite often and can’t get anywhere without this app. However, this week it’s been totally wrong, omitting trains, omitting buses, showing Final destinations which is not what I put in  and I’ve had to resort to using Google Maps (which is always correct). I’m only taking away one star because I’m sure you’ll have this fixed soon but please do. | Prices schedule, everything is incorrect. Do not use to plan or budget. They do not allow users to update it seems. Very disappointing app | R2R is not what it used to be. Very few recent reviews.  I think they had a great product and blew it. | Rome to Rio is fine by itself but when you try to get tickets it hands off to omio.  Omio pretends to be time to Rio but the interface is lousy.  It takes you a while to figure out you need to get out of the Omio fake site and back to the real time to Rio interface. I wish they had not taken a freak app and coupled it to a bad one. | I like the app but for some reason trains aren’t showing. Can you please fix it or tell me what to do. | Keeps crashing when I look at train routes from Annecy to Geneva for September 2nd. | Seems like a helpful app so far but not in the US, it has a car ride for two dollars for 22 minutes. That’s not gonna happen, most tickets for airlines I’ve researched so far don’t exist. I do like how it shows the numerous options from one point to another, so there is a growing future for this app. | I used to be able to map out a route, pick stops, find interesting stops and alternate routes. No more. The app now only allows a starting point and a destination-and forget about stops on any routes but the most commercially travelled.
Dammit.
I'll have to find another app.
I am sooooo disappointed in you, RtR. | MY FAVORITE go to travel app. The instant, accurate travel to and from options are absolutely amazing. From anywhere to anywhere, this app tells me ALL possible ways to get places. Recommended routes, tolls, even hotels along the way!!! | can't find a way to clear location history searches

deleted | I have used this app to travel the world! It is consistently the best tool I have to travel from one place to the next. I love the variety of options it gives and how it even gives approximate prices! I am always recommending this app to fellow travelers cause I personally don’t travel without it. | This app is great I love how this app is different than all other navigation apps I like the set up I like how you can navigate where you want to go if you are a person who wants the longest or prettiest way that can be a quickest way do this app but sometimes it can tell you a way that is super duper long a lot longer and slower and it wastes your time so shorter distances are better it is a great app for different types of vehicles more than google maps has and this app is helpful very helpful if you have a person who lives inside the city downtown very helpful for that | I remember using the website Rome to Rio years ago and I was able to add all my stops on my trip and see my whole route laid out on the map. It doesn’t appear to be possible anymore. At least not on a mobile device or the app. 

I love the Rome to Rio app for finding estimates of transportation prices, and routes to get between place. It is a great app and I recommend to anyone who does a lot of traveling. 

Dear app developers, Can you please make it so I can route out my entire trip and see it on the map? Like add multiple destinations? There is not a single app in the App Store that allows me to do this. One app lets you add up to 7 destinations in a route, but it’s mediocre and I need to be able to add unlimited stops (I am going to travel long term). 

Please update the app to include this feature! It would be a perfect 5 stars if I could do this. I’m seriously begging you haha | I’ve just downloaded because it offers a large amount of African countries and probably better than google maps. I wish it had option to save, like or favorite trips to go back and use in future travel. Not enough interaction on app. | Please fix. Running iOS 13.5 on iPhone 11 Pro Max 246 GB. Thank you. | I used this app to get from EWR to a town in Connecticut. I had never traveled alone before, and I saw so many different options around the internet. This app made it as easy as it possibly could be, and i was able to navigate to where i needed to be with ease. Loved this app, and will absolutely use again. | I had to plan a complex trip using several different means of transportation. Rome2Rio helped me figure out the best way, how each scenario would work, would cost and how much time it would take. It’s ingenious. Critical for trip planning international, domestic and local trips. Thank you! | when we were europa last year,we used this application  many of time .so this  app is the best for me to find the best and fast way to transfer from town to town.i suggest to use it. | This app helped out a lot navigating South Korea’s subway system. True lifesaver. | Didn’t update the bus schedule, had to leave 4 hours later instead | This app use to be my go to app for best traveling options but $omething has changed. it looks like they sold out and are only featuring sponsors or advertisers. Tried to help out a friend by showing them a route, I take monthly, on the app and my route isn’t even an option!! Come to find out this bus company did not advertise so it’s no longer offered as an option. The routing is the least expensive, the fastest (after flying) and the most reliable public option. And it’s not anywhere on the website or app as an option. In my eyes, BIG FAIL Rome2rio!! Sad to have to delete what WAS such an amazing tool. | My first time visiting Spain. I used Rome2rio app to help navigate how and where to go. This app is amazing. It showed me different routes of transportation from train, to bus, ride share, driving. I really liked that it gave a recommendation too which is best route. Most times we needed train ride. We just click ticket image at bottom of app and all the pricing and departure times are available. All e-tickets are sent to email. I had a complication and emailed the company. The response to my questions and complaint are handled very promptly and so professionally.  Highly recommend this app. | Ink | While trying to book a trans-Siberian train trip across Russia, this app came to my attention.  It does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help book the transportation from it, making my priceless time wasted as my frustration grows.  Don’t waste your time with this.  Use Orbitz, Expedia, Travelocity, or some other transport app if you need to book something. | I've used this website for over a year and just realized there is a phone app!!!!! :-) Yay!!

 It's super user friendly, accurate, and exactly what I need when I'm traveling to gauge time. What a wonderful site!  Ive recommended it to a few friends already and they love it!

***Addition to my initial post... this app is still awesome!  I travel to Europe and this is an essential tool for gauging distances. 

*** Site developers- please continue to support and keep this app relevant. I would hate to attempt to use this app and “poof” its gone :-(. 

Excellent app!!!!  Love it!!! | Haven’t used this app in forever was cleaning up my phone and going through all the trips and traveling I have done and just forgot how amazing it truly. Don’t usually leave reviews but wanted to to make sure this app stays alive and grows 🥂🛩🤞🏾 | I used Rome2rio to get from Zurich to Liechtenstein to Luxembourg to Paris. My transit troubles happened only when I ignored its recommendation.

That was June. In August I used it in Central and Eastern Europe. Seven countries, 16 cities - buses, shuttles, trains and airplanes. This app is spectacular. | Easy to use. First place I look for planning over seas trips.  Better information then google maps on transportation. | I love this app and use it all the time! | Just visited London and Paris for the first time and this app was extremely helpful for getting around on the subway! It also showed train, bus and walking options, as well as estimated prices for Ubers and taxis. Very easy to use! | Love this app and use it for all my travels . | A wonderful resource that links you to local bus and train companies (if that’s how you choose to travel).  Compares travel times and costs, and is the best way to figure out complex travel!  How else would I have found out that the fastest and cheapest way from Kaiserslautern to London Heathrow is through Luxembourg City?  I always check before I travel... | This is my “go-to” app for deciding best and easiest ways to get from place to place. I use it every time I travel and every time I start planning trips. | I am really satisfied for use of this app, its really useful!! I recommend to All travelers | This app have reduced my search time immensely. It shows the options and allows me to make an informed decision. Does the train go there? How many times does the bus stop there in a day? What bus line goes there? Should I just rent a car? Rome2rio got me the answers in one search! | Comprehensive guide to getting around the world.  From small town NH to Europe it provides excellent options for public transportation to walking. | Rome to Rio app is the way to go especially if you’re on a budget and especially if you don’t know where the hell you’re going enjoy | We travel several times a year and often find ourselves off the beaten path so having Rome2Rio is invaluable. Just type in your point of origin and destination and several options (drive, transit, air) appear with routes and estimated costs along with links to the airplane, train, bus etc. I’m on a forum with fellow travelers and whenever someone poses the question about how to get from A to B many respond with Rome2Rio. It is our GO TO app when we are looking for travel options. | I love this app!!  I spend 200 days on the road every year stabilizing and restoring rivers all over the country.  I use this app EVERY DAY planning trips and trying to link together projects so I can save my clients money and reduce wear and tear on my old body.  Free and fantastic!! | I use it for all my trips.. I don’t know what I would do with out this app | This app. rocks.  Not sure how I ever traveled without it. | I have used this coast to coast in US and across the UK. Never failed me yet. | An outstanding tool for public transportation.   Have used this in Europe
and Japan...has saved us a lot of worries and makes for a much smoother trip.",4.66553,882,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6b/a9/15/6ba9159d-3d69-e0ed-ab81-e9c52b05299f/6b39fda0-edc5-4324-a82e-668c524ccc3b_1-5.5-munich-paris-search.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f8/cc/82/f8cc82f8-4c47-97dd-1da9-7dab1163034e/f9bc1901-c431-4a4d-831c-9b44a37a2330_1-5.5-munich-paris-search-results.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5b/43/99/5b439981-6717-062b-d56c-0b418fdea9b9/ad10b17c-f6dc-41ca-8282-b734ecd8fbcd_iPhone_8_Plus-02NotificationDetails.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/06/59/f2/0659f284-6729-fe52-ff93-ee19bc968760/95997ebb-1de6-4990-ac1b-12aa56497e19_2-5.5-munich-paris-results-dark.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1d/6d/64/1d6d64d6-7ce7-c8a4-2931-ce49bddab2a1/07d7eda2-c163-4871-9019-c8d0a8971d34_3-5.5-london-athens-search.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/18/51/51/18515164-699f-eee4-2dbf-bc0d13ea61d8/130a4639-62cb-4496-8b22-9b3a70a478a1_3-5.5-london-athens-flight.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b4/64/90/b4649076-00d3-bda9-a20a-eb653f0e424e/84525764-ba89-4afd-8bb8-5932d71a1d96_3-5.5-london-athens-map.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/3a/e7/3f/3ae73f03-0da5-54de-6aff-1d16c601866a/bb9ae00b-a03c-4bf7-b1af-83e6d5a0d8d0_3-5.5-london-athens-dark-map.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

For bookings in the US and overseas I go no other. | Super fácil encontrar un vuelo con conexiones. | I haven’t traveled in years and I find Kayak confusing and not very user friendly for first timers. I couldn’t find explanations or instructions on what’s expected of me to actually book a flight. | Gracias x este servicio de avisar | Please add filters for aircraft manufacturer and model. That will make me start using this app again. Ideally let me save the filter as part of my preferences. | Everything good | I have used Kayake for many years now and find it to be the best app for finding the best deals for traveling. | Use Kayak all the time. Today airport codes are not loading and locations aren’t being recognized | Hey!! I love to travel with Kayak, but I’ve been having problems daily with Kayak that I want to be fixed so I can be able to travel much better with Kayak.

Problem 1.
Sometimes when I search up an airport, I’ve been seeing that the airport that I am searching up for, wouldn’t show up.I’ve been seeing this a lot so please, if you can Kayak, please improve that you can fix this problem I’ve been having daily with.

Problem 2.
Sometimes when I search up a flight, it takes forever to load and even when I go to sleep, it is still loading and will never ever stop.Please Kayak if you can improve that you can fix this problem please do so I can have Kayak much better daily.

Please fix these 2 big problems I’ve been having daily with Kayak.

Thanks!!!!! | Great | Doesn’t even show you the cheapest or best flight options. 
I looked on Vueling for a destination with some specific dates: Direct flight R/T 178€
Kayak’s result for +-3 days around same dates as Vueling’s: 190€ one-stop flight..on Vueling.

🛑App deleted!🛑 | Kayak is not disclosing full price you pay- they didn’t disclose resort fee. I would not have booked it if they had disclosed it. Uninstalling app. Would not recommend | I love you | Very good deals. Thanks. | I love kayak! | Kayak used to be really nice, but now they have opened to scammers like Ovago and Gurufare. | Really good at finding cheap flights | The best option and many deals | The search function has been updated in such a way that it automatically brings you to the “Explore” tab and only shows roundtrips (even if you input One-Way in your search) to a specific airport (i.e. only shows flights to/from MIA even if you enter “Miami Metropolitan Area” in your search, thereby precluding FLL and PBI from the results). These changes have rendered the app useless for the purposes I use it - to compare one way flights from general metropolitan areas (i.e. NYC to South Florida). | Booked a hotel through the app.  It was the worst travel experience ever!  Showed up with our whole family to find out the hotel was over booked and they cancelled our room!  No warning or anything. Had to repack our car and drive another hour to the next available hotel. It was not in a great area and a sketchy place all together.  Even though we never stayed in the room and had all these issue we can’t get a refund!!  Terrible experience. | I’m trying to cancel a hotel reservation. No number, no link to cancel, no cancel button. 
Same thing happened when I tried to cancel a car years ago. Intentional. I’m deleting the app as soon as I get this hotel canceled. | Great UI/UK easy to navigate to find great airfares! | Blocked as bot searching for vacay destinations | This site always seems to be where I start to find my flights | Great site. I can always sort to
My preferences and feel like I get a great rate. | Please add filters to remove boeing airplanes from flights. | I love this way of buying my flights, it is very helpful to find a cheap flight along with my budget. Thankyou so much. | Very good app for flight ticket booking, I had very good experience with the application | Kayak sent an alert of $616  EWR to CDG R/T but when I click, I get everything BUT NOT the ability to book! | Super convenient, affordable, and easy to plan trips around your budget. | I’ve used this app many, many times to get great deals on flights. The explore feature is rad. Very flexible app that if you dig into can really get you a good deal. No joke. | Do not use Kayak. They automate travel sites that also includes scams and upcharges. Use Travelocity. They qualify their partners from my experience. Was charged over $1,000 in travel insurance that was hidden: had to cancel my cc. | How do you have eDream here???? | Me encanta | Confianza y son unicos | Kayak used to be an excellent aggregator if information and direct connection to companies (hotels, airlines). Now they often simply direct you to third party sketchy companies. Not good at all. | Does not allow me to book a rental car through the app. | This app is full of legal scams so do not even trust its partner sights. Book directly with the airline | Great information & excellent cost savings 👍 | Sick and tired of Kayak ads. The more i see them, the more i want to delete the app from my phone. | I love how consistently accurate this app is! | Fantastic price. Always recommend friends and families. Always have better deals | When I want to know the arrival and departures of any flight I used Kayak. It’s always up to date with flight information | I’m noticing a glitch I’ve seen for recent years now in that my nearest airport is drastically higher priced than the other airport nearby PSC. I cross reference with Alaska Airlines website our only rural airline and I discover it hundreds of dollars cheaper sometimes. Please correct! | PLEASE 🙏 THANK YOU 🙏 | 10/10 definitely recommend !! | This is amazing because I can’t find these low prices on the actual website for the airline ✈️😃 | What a great site. Gives the whole picture and has many filters allowing to get only and exactly what you’re looking for!!! Been saving $100’s and still only flying my fave airlines!!!

When you want to access flight details you really need you have to scroll endlessly. | Used to be my favorite app for travel things. Now just deleted it. First never finds flight info under booking number anymore, and now every time you open app you need to type in your email and get a code which is stupid if you can set up Face ID Touch ID or whatever but not that stupid way. Disappointed and deleted it. | I attempted to give this app a try. I should have read the reviews first. There is limited synch with this app. This app does NOT Work. Pass it by. There is NO tutorial or how to use guide. You are guessing at this. | This app used to be great, giving you updates on your flight in the airport. Now it doesn’t even register an itinerary!
Looking at the positive reviews, they are from 5-6 years ago, now this app has become useless! | I’ve been using the KAYAK app and wanted to try this one out. However, unlike KAYAK, which seems to ingest confirmation emails that are forwarded to it quite flawlessly, this app does not. Therefore, it makes things more difficult. Otherwise it has a slick interface. | The app was merely spammy and full of ads in the past; after the ‘update’ it is deprived of features, full of bugs, and still spammy. Doesn’t show anything when offline at foreign airports. That’s when you need the app the most. Trips can’t get deleted in the app once added through the chat bot! I’ve cancelled flights and can’t remove them. When opening the app and swiping through flights, the app jumps to the first flight in the list randomly. Ridiculous programming. Trips can’t be added to calendar any longer. Trips don’t get update when the date for a booking number has changed (changed flight with airline) Today I received five times the same spam notification urging me to book a lounge through the app or their website. This app has become utterly useless, frustrating, and annoying (notification spam). Avoid! | Super annoying SLOW Assistant based interface - just give us a basic interface with fields to enter! | I cannot count the time wasted with your app. It is not helpful at all. I have tried every reference number to add my flights. I have tried to manually add and it has only added half my trip. This app is not helpful whatsoever. I sound not have had to work so hard to get my trips added. 
Makes me so frustrated | Don’t waste your time.  This used to be the best for my travels.  It has saved me from missing an overseas flight twice when the airline delay would make me miss the connecting flight to Germany. Since the last updates it is almost useless.  All the information that was so helpful is gone. So disappointing.  I would have paid to keep the previous version.  Deleted from my phone.  Looking for a replacement. | How could they screw this up so badly. This app now has been rendered useless. Can’t check on any detail about your flight, only simple things like flight numbers and time. THAT’S IT!!! You can’t even see your seat and frequent flyer info. And if you have other people on the same booking? Just forget about it, you can’t check on anything whatsoever. What a f up update. Pointless indeed. | This app is just a scam to withhold your flight confirmation number. I’ve learned my lesson. | It used to sync trip details with the calendar, not anymore | Used to be the best traveling app… not it’s just an overly complicated chatbot under a wanna-be AI disguise that simply does not work. | I used to love this app and would use it to morganite every single trip and introduced it to several friends. Then they upgraded and it became completely useless. I wonder if the developers don’t see that usage has dropped. It would be better for them to revert to the former version honestly. This new version is just awful.  I have moved on to other travel apps. | It is clearly on the airlines flight schedule for that day. I sent in request for fixing it and they said working on it. Still nothing done or working. I deleted it as we are leaving in three weeks. | This app was a very good travel app but it has lost it’s way. Recently had to load booking code (6alpha numeric) to get flight information. This was OK. BUT when it provided “check in” tap the app asked for the booking code. Why? No memory. App knows airlines but if you have already check-in the app can’t cross check with airlines.  I find it’s best to use the airline app and merely use this app (if at all) as a quick reference tool | I tried adding my trip manually several times and it kept giving me wrong flight info, and there is no way to update just one flight of a multi-flight itinerary, which is very frustrating.

I then emailed my itinerary as the other option suggested. When it came back it was still incorrect. 

Not worth my effort, deleted won’t try again. | Over the course of five days, I tried to add a trip using all three of the methods suggested.  I tried to manually add my trip at least 10 times all to no avail.  While this app used to be quite seamless, it now doesn’t seem to work and there doesn’t seem to be anyone you can talk to.  The “assistant” doesn’t connect you to a live person.  I’m ready to dump this app. | Something changed with this app and it’s totally nonfunctional, frozen screen, lost decades of travel data and absolutely zero customer service. | I used this app before, but suddenly it stopped working. Try to add trip and it send you to digital assistant and it goes nowhere | This was a good app a few years ago and extremely useful for a frequent traveler.  It would quickly identify your flights based on your ticket code and provide accurate, timely updates if flights were delayed etc.  Not now - since an “upgrade” (which apparently brought in “artificial intelligence”…) it rarely finds my flights from the reservation code and most times now you have to enter data manually, even when traveling on major airlines. The update facility has either disappeared or just doesn’t work anymore - I am sat in a plane which was announced to be delayed 6 hours ago and CheckMyTrip still hasn’t picked up on it.  It is now a complete waste of time.  I used to use this app all the time and rely on it for frequent travel.  Sadly it is going downhill rapidly… | I heard about this app on a trusted travel forum.  I really just doesn’t work.  Can find my flights using confirmation code, cant find my reservation using flight/date combination.

Not worth the time I spent.  Deleted the app on Day 1 | Used to be a useful website and app, now totally useless. Fails to import bookings and relies on a stupid chat agent for doing anything. Just chasing the AI bandwagon by adding a dumb chat bot for basic functionality. Deleting my account and the app. | I’ve been trying for 20 minutes to login for the first time. It keeps sending a code to my email and when I paste and add it into the app, it says it is an invalid code. Does anybody know if a better app to keep track of my travel itinerary? | We used to enter the booking reference but now it asks to enter each flight number and date … bit of a pain on a long trip with many flights and days | Doesn’t add trips either via forwarded email or manually.  No support.  Message app reply to request says basically that they are busy with other requests.  It’s worth the cost-i.e. nothing.  I use TripIt for all my travel —great app and well worth paying for. | It takes forever trying to search your trip if its on a different email. They have ruined the app. Nobody wants to sit and chat with a bot and enter all flight details manually. Not a great idea. Should go back to the way it was. | So extra for no reason, AI used in app is trash I hope to god I never have to use it again | If you can’t access your email that you originally set up the account with you can never sign back in because the app will only send a code to the defunct email account. Its as dunb as it sounds. | It needs a way to correct a flight without deleting the entire trip. Flight from ORD-YVR comes up as Omaha to Chicago | This stupid AI app ever. Doesn’t work whata junk | Used to be comprehensive and good. Now, pathetic | Do not waste your time with this app | It working very well, why u change and remove everything, what is the point now from your current up?!!! | The new version is awful, fully stripped down of features and providing as little information as possible. New trips are difficult to add, they disappear after adding, while deleted trips reappear. The assistant is unhelpful. Amadeus is well equipped to provide a good product and this is clearly an act of self destruction. | The app used to be good without the digital assistant. From the reviews that I’ve read, it looks like the developers aren’t looking to fix the app. Welp….time to switch apps. | It was sooo much easier to use without the bot. Even after adding details, can’t see trip. Scrap the bit feature | The latest version of this app it is a huge mistake. 
I’ve used CheckMyTrip for at least 20 years, even when it was just a webpage and not an app and with the new upgrade I cannot use it any longer. 
I used to store all my business and personal trip information using booking reference and my name info but now the only way to automatically import trip information with the booking reference is if you have personally booked the trip with your email address which it is not the normal practice in the business world. 
I hope that future versions will incorporate back the option to import bookings with the traveler info. | The update that requires use of a cumbersome chat bot for any inputs was a bad choice by the app developers.  It involves what should be in unnecessary inputs and is not initially intuitive. Please bring back the option to enter the old way.  Will not use this app, which I liked using before this change, until this requirement is removed and at worst the chat bit is an option. | We’ve used this app in the past and it was awesome. From the last time we’ve used it it has gone off a cliff horrible | This was a great APP prior to the latest update which crashed all of the data and no longer accepts confirmation numbers when you use a travel agent.  Sent in more than 5 requests to their customer support with no response.  I’ve deleted the APP and made note of the developer to avoid any future APPs created by them. | New version is quite useless and not user-friendly. Unable to add trip easily like the old versions. I will probably not use this anymore and have to rely on each airline’s mobile app instead for each trip. | This had been a fine app.  In March, however, they rolled out a purported “update” that simply does not work in any respect.  It’s not only useless, but it’s a negative — you undertake actions to add flights to the app, only to find that there’s nothing there.  I cannot understand why they ever rolled out the “update” or why, upon realizing that it was a complete bust, they didn’t go back to the old, functional app.  Unreal.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD IN ITS CURRENT STATE. | Was working great, a favorite app. Latest update requires a fresh log in and now my trip is lost and the Amadeus booking code is “unknown.” Not happy. | The recent update destroyed the app. I used to really like this app prior to the recent update and probably would’ve rated it as 4 or 5 stars for that version. However, since the most recent update the app is now a shell of its former self. It is clunky and hard to use, and 95% of the information it used to provide is gone. 
Don’t waste your time with this app so long as this is the version is in operation because it is useless in this form. | This app is practically worthless. Trying to add a trip in the app? Don’t bother. You won’t be able to unless you forward your confirmation email to the developer. This app is a horrible waste of time.

Update: I forwarded my trip confirmation email, received a reply email stating it was added, and it still doesn’t populate in the app. This app isn’t “practically” worthless… it’s COMPLETELY worthless. | Last update makes you go into a chat with a virtual admin assistance and you cannot see your trips anymore. Big mistake, everyone I know is going to another app. | Latest update seems to have broke the app. I keep getting dummy notifications and emails for random trips that are not mine. | Won’t load my SW flights.

I use this app every day. I love the optimize feature for my routes. I am making double the number of sales calls daily. It keeps record of your visits which is a helpful tool for reporting.
Also have to mention the name tag feature for viewing your companies list on the map 😍10/10 for anyone in sales 👍🏼 | Can’t even get past the login screen. Piece of crap. | A lot of good things about this app I could say and I’m sure all these other reviews could and do tell you but I sometimes put in a full set of leads and seconds later they delete it’s the most frustrating thing about this app | I’ve used this app for a few years with great success and also good support from the developer.   This past week it’s started crashing once the app was turned on for use.   The developer answered the phone the first time I called me and offered a fix yet that hasn’t fixed the problem and thus this app is not operational.  I’ve been respectfully (phone call only once a day, one text per day, one email per day) reaching out to the developer for the last two plus days and am hearing only crickets.    I hope the developer is okay yet I’m kind of dead in the water with working my book of business and new leads. | I’m going one star because I have been using Mapview for 3 years now and most recently I have been having issues with trips not optimizing, the app closes randomly when doing various activities such as importing spreadsheets, optimizing trips, searching for names, changing filters, etc. These are the basics features that used to make this app the best for work. Unfortunately I have not received any response from customer support regarding my issues and now feel they are intentionally not responding to me. I will update or remove this review if these issues are resolved. Until then do not waste your money investing in the app, you’re better off going with free one. I’m paying $13/mo for an app that doesn’t work. Makes no sense. | Using this app was a game changer until this past week. It is impossible to use on iPad. It opens and crashes. I have re-installed more times than I can count, to no avail.

From one very unhappy user. | Needs more customer service. Great product | I love it except for one thing a lot of times when I sign in to my app it kicks me out automatically and I have to do it a number of times before I get to use it besides that this program is absolutely amazing. | 2 stars because the number of times the app crashes and or force closes while I’m using the app.  I counted 8 times in 6.5 minutes.  Frustrating to say the very least. I have emailed customer service repeatedly and have yet to receive a reply. 
5 stars because I have been looking for an app to replace this one and I have been unable to find one that provides the mass importing of my customers and separate grouping as well.  So I continue to use it in spite of the difficulties of using it | Went to use an all my contacts disappeared. Emailed them been 3 days no response. Went in an did a restore to backup - nothing. Emailed them again no response. Before all this would have given them 3.5 to 4 rating but now they seem to think once you pay for the PRO version an they have your money they could care less about you | The crashing of the app has been if going on for a while with no clear resolution or communication. Great app for what I need it to do.. when it works. Been using for almost 2 years. However, the efficiency of its functionality is steadily declining. | Emailed support but no answer yet - thanks! | 1) This app used to show driving directions between two locations by simply clicking on two points. That functionality no longer exist. 

2) I can’t find a way to sync between two devices. The developer claims you can set up an iCloud account, but this doesn’t work.

There is zero phone support. I have emailed the company and have received no response at all - zero again. After entering a huge amount of data, I am forced to look for another app. Sad! | This app is extremely helpful with my day to day business. I would highly recommend using. Very convenient! | I signed up for a 30 day trial that ends on August 31. Today is the 23rd and they already tried to bill me for the yearly plan. The only reason I knew was a notification from Apple. This is simply not right and I’ll bet I’m not the only one this has happened to. | This app use to be the best on the market. Did everything I needed as a field sales rep. Now it closes unexpectedly when I am in the middle of entering data into a lead. Some times it takes me 3-4 tries to finish a task. I sent an email to the support team over a week ago and they haven’t gotten back to me. In the past, I would get a call or email within hours of having an issue. This issue is completely unacceptable and needs to be fixed. | I do love everything about this app.  It is a very useful sales tool, but until the crashing issues get worked out I can’t give it the 5 stars it deserves. | I have been stuck a few times during my initial client upload, and when I wanted to add new clients. Casey always responds quickly, professionally and with great courtesy and his directions are so easy to follow and ALWAYS fixes my issues.
What a great company and the App is absolutely a game changer for any “road warrior “ who knows that time = money!
Thank you Casey and thank you Mapview | App will not stop crashing. Be sure if the user service and efficiency it creates we have over 200 fold agents using the program. It’s required when they onboard. I get it, bugs happen and need worked out. Why has the communication stopped? 

This is now having a major impact on our business. | App keeps crashing!! | Still waiting for it to work with new IOS | Pls update us as to when 14.1 will be available | Spoke to CALVIN ON HOW TO IMPORT INTO MAPVIEW FROM A SPREADSHEET AND HE WAS GREAT! DEF MAKES LIFE EASIER! | Mapview has been great to use and helps with efficiency for Route Planning, CRM note taking, and being able to export the list after a weekly sales trip. Also, whenever we need tech support for question, they are promptly to reply either email or discuss over phone. Thank-you Mapview | Just what I needed for a 30 year old mobile business which doubled over past 2 years. This app helps me focus. I have a very large data base that even Apple warned me was too big and Mapview can handle it. I keep finding more features and I’ve barely scratched the surface. Email questions to friendly tech support are answered clearly, within hours. Thank you Mapview. I’ve come a long way from Thomas Guides LOL | I have used this app at the highest priced plan for several years now. Every five minutes it crashes and deletes all of my imported contacts. Nobody is available online to live chat and my emails get rejected and sent back to me. Unfortunately I am finding a new provider for this... | This application is a game changer for insurance agents regardless if you’re a telesales agent or a face to face agent. You’re able to import excel sheets by converting to cvs files and loading all the data in in a matter of minutes rather than manually entering client information in. Once loaded you have a “map” birds eye view of all your clients in the location they live. You can set filters to each client based on the criteria you want. You also can log client conversations or any additional material inside each clients individual file. Helps tremendously for follow up calls to have quick access at notes. 

There’s also a route optimization feature to plan your route for the day, and it will show you the optimum route based on your preference. 

Quick features such as one click to dial from inside the clients file allows you to call blitz an area to schedule close proximity appointments, and a one click to pull up the map and route to someone’s house. 

When it comes to organizing your book of business and an app that helps you with one management look to Mapview. I would pay more money for it, it helps me that much! | I’ve used this app for a couple years and use it everyday. It has helped me keep track of all the accounts in my territory and has been a great tool to increase my business. | Used this App daily for call planning and routing. My customers were K-12 schools in Florida.  Rather than spending a half of a day figuring out which schools to target in a given area and the best order for calls (to minimize backtracking), I just opened Mapview, picked a geographic area to target (my customer locations were easy to see on the map) and hit the road. Huge productivity tool. It doesn't get much simpler. | Sales rep Calvin spent hours helping me to import it!! (I’m not at all tech savvy & I didn’t create the proper excel Sheet...)
MAPVIEW IS AMAZING!!!!! | Excellent app, have been using it since ‘13 (back when it was Sales Navigator) and still use it regularly. As a bonus, their Support team is super-responsive and helpful. Top notch overall! | Could not ask for faster response and helpful information to get the app where I need it for a field sales rep. This will be one of the best tools I have to efficiently manage my territory. | Have been using for about three years.  Outstanding and well worth the expense.  Removed hours a week of plotting visits, and increased the face time with customers, definitely increased my productivity and sales. | I have worked with this app for about four years and I always appreciate their customer service. They are prompt and helpful! | This is everything I have needed as an outside sales rep. Gives me what I need to track my habits with regards to where I am in time and space
So excited I found this | I have been looking for an app like this for a while. Found this one and have enjoyed the time it has saved me. If I had a complaint it would be the learning curve of course that could be me not the app. I have used the contact us a couple of times in the app and Mr. Calvin Casey has always responded same day if not within hours sometimes within minutes. Truly a great app! | I had an issue pop up with the data not showing accurately on the map. I got quick response on the weekend during evening hours! | Mapview is an awesome app. It keeps me organized and stores all of my notes and information. The best part of all is the wonderful support team they have if you are having a problem. They get back to you immediately and work with you until the problem is fixed or you know what you are doing. I could not do my job without it. 
Thanks Calvin and Yufei-You guys are the best 🤗🤗 | I use this app everyday.  Still has some evolving to do but the team seems dedicated & determined to progress.  The best part is the simplicity and UX | This app is not free you have to pay each month | I had trouble logging in to a second device, customer service was fast and helpful to rectify. I use this map for work and love it! | MapView is awesome and their support is awesome, too! I was having problems (complete user error!) and Casey helped me resolve it (which was a simple fix) with just one click! He kept responding back with suggestions until we got it figured out, very much appreciated!  Thanks again for the support! | I just purchased this app as it looks like it can be quite helpful, and it may turn out to be eventually.  Few of the functions are intuitive and the “support” on the website is HORRIBLE and I can’t even find a help section in the app.  I did get a timely and helpful 
call back to help upload a spreadsheet, but trying to learn how to use many of the basic functions listed is a nightmare.  Need to improve or actually create a tutorial. | No, seriously. You want more sales? Stop WASTING TIME and see more people by being efficient with your leads. Get it now? 

More leads =/= more $$$, higher conversion ratio does. 

I’m not paid by anyone but by my own effort and sales. If you’re remotely considering this it’s because you’re probably your own boss. This is a the most comprehensive CRM, and the BIGGEST INSURANCE agencies are using it. Ehmm... Lincoln Heritage LIC.

It’s all about being efficient and getting in-front of more clients. This app lets me import .cvs leads right into it, this feature is super costly in apps like Route4Me. It lets me make calls with a different number on it and right on my iPad. | When I found this app it changed the way I did business!  The functionality of this app combined with its ease of use is amazing. Continued updates and development as well as phenomenal customer service have made this a God-send.  
I would recommend this to anyone who manages a database of contacts in a variety of geographic locations. The multiple labels, tags and filters allowed this to accomplish everything I needed. | I've tried many different apps that route my day for me, but MapView takes it to another level. MapView allows me to not only plan out my day, but it allows me to keep up with my book of business. I'm able to add pictures and notes of every single client that way no one is ever forgotten!

There are many different filters to choose from. It's completely customizable. If you're in the life insurance business, you HAVE to have this app. 

I've had MapView for a year now and they continue to improve things. And most importantly, they stand by their product and have an awesome team to give me the support I need. 

Every single agent that I hire will have MapView! Thank you guys so much 👊 | Love this app. It has simplified my business in visiting my clients along with me staying much more organized.  Even when I encountered a small glitch with the app, customer service reached out to me to fix the problem!! | This app has been a lifesaver out in the field. And I'm not technologically savvy, but it's impressive functions are easy to use. When I have any questions or issues, the reps are professional and patient. Rep Calvin Casey has assisted me along the way and it makes all the difference to have knowledgeable support at your fingertips. He went above and beyond in helping me with the app and even with Excel! Thank you so much Calvin!! | Mapview has been everything to me in my sales career. I love being able to see which of my prospects are in my area, and have navigation to each. Also, getting to log notes after each visit enabling me to pick up with the client where I left off. 

Any challenges I have had or assistance I have needed, their customer care group has been very quick to get in touch with me and help me out. 

I have an edge on my competition, and I am indebted to Mapview for that. Thank you, Mapview and the Casey Group! Cheers to many more years of changing the sales landscape. | This app stands above the rest. It’s in a class all by itself. It does everything I always wished my other contact manager and mapping apps would do. I can see exactly where I am, where I’m going, where my leads & customers are AND I can even make notes about each one to help me remember later. 
I recently contacted the developer for help in syncing (the excessive number of custom contact filters I had created on) my iPhone with my iPad. Not only did they CALL me immediately to walk me through the process, but they also attended to me as if I were their only customer. I’ve NEVER had such a positive experience with an app developer.

You have to keep so many things in your head: itinerary, date and time, transfers from and to an airport, travel expenses, packing lists, address of the hotel, the sights you’d like to visit, the documents you have to carry with you… Sounds quite difficult, right?

No more worries! Plan&Go will help you organize your perfect trip in a few simple steps.

KEEP ALL YOUR DOCUMENTS IN ONE PLACE
Upload the documents you need for every trip right to the app, be it your passport, identity card, health insurance or driving license. Moreover, you can store all your tickets and hotel bookings.

CREATE PACKING LISTS FOR ANY TRIP
Have you ever forgotten your headphones, favorite t-shirt or, even worse, documents at home? Be sure that nothing will slip out of your mind any more: you can create any packing list you need. Whether you are traveling on business or planning vacation at the seaside, you can customize packing lists for any specific purpose.

TRACK YOUR TRAVEL EXPENSES
Unexpected expenses may arise while you are traveling. Plan&Go will help you track all your spendings so that you could allocate your travel budget wisely.

CREATE TRIP ITINERARY
All the tickets, transfers, car sharing services, sightseeing, meetings with friends or colleagues and other activities are stored in one place! No need to check your notes, calendar or daily planner. Just upload all the info in advance into the app, and you’ll always have it at hand.

PLAN A TRIP OF YOUR DREAM
If you are not going to travel right now, you can still create your perfect trip and organize the itinerary in advance or plan your honeymoon. Add the countries and cities you’ve dreamt of, check the monuments, museums, parks and restaurants at this destination, and just wait for the best time to start your adventure!

Get prepared for your next trip with Plan&Go!

I do wish the method of travel could be edited. | Polar steps is simple to use and would get a five star review from me, but the one feature I would love to use I can not get to work - making a book from everything I add to a trip! | I like the UI and visualization, but it is such a pain having to fight the app in order to add locations (which it renames to the county—who ever cares about the county? Just name the step the location you searched, like Grand Canyon should not be renamed to the county), then when you add photos the suggestions are always off and you have to manually look through photos. 

What it should do is look at your photos and suggest all the ones on that same date, even if they don’t have the geo location tag (DSLR photos). Entering in dates is also a pain, new step button for some reason always assumes you do it on a new day, so I have to go back and manually change that too. I’m sure if you use it to actively track new trips it works okay, but I’m frustrated with the experience of filling it in manually. It captured some of the trips I did in the past by analyzing my photos, but again renames all the locations to stuff nobody knows (it calls Muir Woods national monument by its county name) and will split trips into two sometimes, with no easy way to combine them. 

Features seem to be there but usability is lacking IMO, not really worth the effort (I did try a few other competitor apps and this is more features but still a pain). | Our daughter is traveling alone in SE Asia and this has been such a wonderful way for her to regularly update all close family and friends with photos, commentary, and maps all in one spot. | Can’t believe how well put together this is. I put in all my trips and it shows the pattern and rolls up all the statistics in a nice clean dashboard. It really is a marvel to behold. Best app I’ve come across in quite some time. | Let me drag and drop steps wherever I want, make the location search better by allowing actual addresses. And I can’t seem to change whether a distance is set to a flight or driving. Do better! | Useless app just collecting all the pictures from your gallery and pretending it to be a trip. Not user friendly at all | It so easy to journal your trip and keep all the love ones up to date. | I love the app but the UX is kinda not good for example I can’t search for a specific location in the guide section  i have to go back and forth google maps to see where it is located on the map , also in the search bar it says search people & place when it shows up it turns to trip , this is UX disaster. Overall make locations searchable | So fun to follow friends on their two-year adventure from Oregon to Antarctica and back - in their custom van! | Recently downloaded the app and was really happy with how it tracked my trip to remote areas in Antarctica.  However, as a whole, this app is frustrating and disappointing to me as a lifetime traveler.  To see it reflecting the sum total of my travels as 2% of the world is not only inaccurate but insulting.  The app should add a means to record lifetime travel or its usefulness is only in the moment during travel or as a means to look back only at recent travel.  

Adding a checklist of countries, cities or the like to capture a user’s full travel history would make it a more fulfilling experience as a user.  I do like how it uses location data from photos in the phone, that too is limited to relatively recent history. | Great app for allowing new puppy owners to track the travels of their new puppy in real time! | This app is simply brilliant! It’s a real journal of your travels, step by step. | I love this app. It’s so fun to see my journey develop over 4 years of travel and beyond | Since joining it has kept me current with my brother’s journey | I always enjoy traveling yet keeping up on these travels can be a bit challenging.  With Polorsteps, I can revisit my specific trip, exact places, comments and photos.  Additionally, I appreciate the ability to track all travel experiences across the globe.  Highly recommend | This is the number 1 app for travel. I can used for free, #1 #1. | I love polar steps and use it to keep a personal record of my overseas and at home travels. It’s easy to use and I really like the map feature. Highly recommend. | I absolutely love this app, I have been using it to track my travels for years now and it’s my favorite! It is so cool to go back and look at the maps it makes! | I absolutely love this app.  I have been tracking my trips - I don’t forget things and my friends can see my adventures! | I have been using polarsteps for about 7 weeks now to track my travels. I loved it at first and had no issues, however in the last few weeks I CONSTANTLY have issues uploading videos. I've tried uploading videos on wifi & data, it still comes up with an error though. Not sure I'll continue using it if this bug persits. | I use Polarsteps for all my travels - it's not just great to share your trip with friends and families, but also to keep your trip documented for later. It's an amazing memory and I love going back to past trips and see what we've been doing. But most importantly, the photobook which you can create is absolutely fantastic. The quality and the design are just perfect. I've ordered about 5 photobooks already and love them all! It is so easy and fast to create that you actually do it. Would 100% recommend!! | I’ve been traveling for a month and found out about this from a fellow traveler. It’s brilliant in concept but I cannot get it to track my current trip. It synced all of my trips from 7 years ago from my photos with all gps location details, and attached photos to those locations. But the point of me using it is for my current trip and it is just a blank slat. Does not import my photos, location, or dates at all. I’ve done everything I can think of, went into a deep dive in my iOS settings, went through the trip settings, my account settings, read through pretty much the ENTIRE help center, scoured Reddit, updated my phone, deleted my account and reinstalled it, restarted my phone etc and NOTHING WORKS!! It wants me to add everything manually down to the date I flew and the location I flew into and then the next place I stayed etc but at no point does it ever finally pick up in syncing to fill the info in. I ended the trips, restarted the trip, every thing I can possibly think of and NOTHING works. What is the point in using this for your friends and family to track your travels if it only syncs trip details after you arrive back home?!?! The only trips it syncs are ones where I’ve ended AND flown back to my home location. Otherwise this stupid thing is WORTHLESS and you might as well just post on social media because it will be endlessly less frustrating!!! | I documented a month long trip through Scotland after I returned home and the result was impressive. It would have been even better had I known about and used the app during the trip. The browser interface for sharing & viewing the trip works well; navigation would be aided if trip steps could be collapsed to a single line showing just the step name. A native iPad UI for the app would also be great as would a built-in airplay option. I could go on with feature requests but for a free app with no advertising Polarsteps shines as is. | we be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. | I have been using Polarsteps since its Beta phase and I love it. I like that my trip posts can be private or public. The app is easy to use. The book editing can be a little time consuming but the final product is of first rate quality. | Polarsteps is awesome!   I have used both the app & website versions for years and can’t say enough good things about them.  It just keeps getting better all the time.  

The team behind PolarSteps is committed to providing a seamless experience for everyone.  I recently encountered an issue, contacted them, and the problem was corrected quickly & perfectly.  

If you are considering PolarSteps, don’t hesitate to try it…..you won’t be disappointed! | Absolutely the best travel tracker app I’ve found. Best way to save all of the memories from your journeys and even convert them into a high quality photo book. | I have three trips that were taken years ago that still show I am traveling. I have tried numerous times to go in and change the end date. I have deleted the app. I am only working on my iPhone. I can’t understand why I can’t get it to end the trip. | Amazing app if you’re into traveling really easy to use. | We are | Great app which is intuitive, easy and highly functional, however the photo book process and options needs work…merger with Shutterfly or Mixbook(?) | I love this app and the concept of documenting your travel. I also love the idea of being able to make a book at the end. But the app is insanely glitchy!!! There have been several instances where I added all my photos and wrote out paragraphs of text, just for Polarsteps to delete parts of it after posting. For example, I just wrote out many paragraphs detailing a day of my trip, and polar steps deleted everything but the first couple sentences. There is no archive and no way of retrieving the lost text. Another time, I uploaded many photos and the app only actually uploaded one. I had to delete the step entirely and try again. 
Love this concept, PLEASE fix this app!!!!!! | I learned about Polarsteps from a fellow American I just happened to meet in Izmir, Turkey, and he told me he was using the app as his  travel blog, so I downloaded it and followed him. Actually, now that I think about it, I started using it that same day in 2018! And I never stopped. How do I remember such details? Because my experience is forever recorded in the app, complete with pictures, maps, and real time experiences. Polarsteps is so easy and intuitive, I have used it for every trip i’ve taken since then. At least 20-30 trips, many them abroad. It is so fun to go back through my past adventures and relive the details. Travel is something so special to me, and I want to remember everything I did, as well as keep my friends and family informed in real time. Polarsteps helps me so that. I highly recommend it. | I gotta tell you, PolarSteps is the bomb-diggity of travel apps! 🌍✈️ Seriously, it’s like having your personal travel guru right in your pocket. I’ve been on the app since the beginning and I’ve happily carried PolarSteps around the globe with me.

One thing that totally rocks about PolarSteps is their overall travel statistics. It’s like looking at your own travel résumé - you can see how many countries you’ve conquered, how many miles you’ve trekked, and even the time you’ve spent in transit (Jetsetter badge, anyone?). It’s perfect for impressing your friends with your travel street cred.

But wait, there’s more! The interactive global map is where the real magic happens. You can zoom in on the exact spots you’ve been, and it’s like reliving your adventures all over again. It’s like having a digital scrapbook that you can share with your peeps, complete with photos and notes.

Plus, the app is super user-friendly. You don’t have to be a tech whiz to navigate it. Whether you’re a seasoned globetrotter or just planning your first big trip, PolarSteps has got you covered. It’s the ultimate travel sidekick, and it’s all about making your journeys cooler than a polar bear’s toenails. 🐧❄️

So, if you’re into tracking your adventures and reliving the good times, PolarSteps is the way to go. It’s the app that turns your travels into epic stories. Happy adventuring, my fellow wanderlusters! 🌟🌏🌟 | Love this App! Wonderful to make a book of your trip! They do an awesome job making your book! | There is a bug where I cannot follow the trips that have been shared with me. When I click a friend’s link, it takes me to the app homepage. Even when I search for that person, it says they have no trips. It works fine on the web version so it must be an app issue. No way to contact support either. | Nice to see friends on their trips | Splendid app to track friends from all over the world as they travel! | I’d like to start off by saying that I absolutely love the step tracking features in this app. It’s like the perfect digital journal for my trips. There are just a few features that irk me when trying to use the newer features. I don’t understand why, if you can load predicted routes using roam to rio, we can’t just use the predicted route as an actual one in step tracking. I hate having to use the steps suggested when tracking is on, but the straight lines look sooo bad in the finished trip map. Why can’t I just say, “yes I took the exact route suggested by roam to rio, use that for the map”? The tracked steps are always random and sometimes skip major sections so it doesn’t follow our route.

 And I want to buy one of the travel books so badly because I spent so much time documenting my trip in this app that there’s no way I’m creating a book in another one, but the features to edit the layout are extremely limited. Only getting to fit 4 photos on a page with a 400 page limit is so hard! If I have a long trip or I want a more photos I’m unable to fit everything I want to show. I took a 2 month trip and was so excited to print the book only to realize that I’d have to pick like 4 photos for each step and they don’t fit onto the page very efficiently. I would gladly drop the $200 for a large travel book if I could actually control the page layouts.

Finally, is there any plan to incorporate the 3D globe that androids have for the iPhone app. I love being able to look at all the steps on the globe on my friends phones but it’s just a flat, non-interactive map on the iPhone. Again, I love the app and I use it all the time, I just wish it had a few more features to make documentation easier. | This is a wonderful app because it allows us as travelers to keep our family and friends abreast of our travels. It’s almost like they’re being there with us I would highly recommend it. | My family and I followed my daughter and her friends on PolarSteps as they traveled through Europe after college graduation. The graduates loved posting multiple photos on PolarSteps and journaling about their journey. They also felt more comfortable posting multiple photos on PolarSteps than on Instagram. | What a great way to record a trip. I tend to take a lot of pictures and I appreciate that I am not limited in what I post, nor am I limited in how much I choose to write. Unfortunately I cannot provide captions for specific pictures. 
Combining a live map of where we are at any specific time is fantastic.
I hope I can make their work worthwhile with picture books ordered after the trip. Great business model idea - I hope it pans out! | I have been using Polar Steps for more than 5 years and my Italy Trip on the app was ruined. The location services are always active and there has been internet access during the whole trip but my steps were not recorded. So basically day one and day 8, no exact routes or anything.

Thanks for that. | Whenever my friend goes on a trip I have the worst time signing in to follow. Get stuck in loop of new password not recognized. | been loving this app. makes keeping my friends and family so easy and fun. I do wish there was a feature where i could turn off the live location without going private or followers only just for safety reasons. | This app is something I have imagined before and wished existed. With a few UI thibgs and some other flow improvements this app could be near perfect in what it does and delivers. 

My only wish is that users were more in control of the privacy settings, and that there were more ways you could manage the way the data is stored and used. | The application give me the feeling to travel from my house in the USA with my family in Europe.  I can follow them through the countries and beautiful photos they take.

The App Store says it costs $49.99 per year, and after you download the “free” version in order to do anything you have to upgrade it and they tell you on that screen the annual subscription rate is $69.99! What ripoff! The if you go ahead and purchase it there is no user guide or instructions on how to use it. I have requested a refund and what to let other users know SAVE YOURSELF SOME GRIEF. | This is the worst app. Won’t let you do anything because of all the google ads. Do Not Recommend!! Awful!! | I purchased the $4.99 plan and it keeps skipping through the page where you put the address in and it goes right back to the subscription page. I will be canceling my plan. | They stole my money you have pay for in advance. I canceled it within 15 min of ordering because I could get pass the advertisement. This app needs to be taken down. | Installed | I downloaded the app and even paid for the subscription. I was unable to use the app even after subscribing. No customer service to resolve the issue. No refunds either. | I bought a year subscription and I still can’t can’t past the ads. What’s the point? | The app immediately launches to the subscription screen which you can not bypass. Decided to try it out because as a medical courier that sometimes drives over 400 miles per day I need to optimize my drive time. Unfortunately even after subscribing I can’t get past the ads. | DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!! 

I am a route driver and was looking for something that could help plan my route as I drive well over 200 miles each day so I got this app. When you first install it, it immediately directs you to buy a subscription. It says “3 days free” and then you’ll be charged for the subscription. {{BUZZER}} wrong answer … you’re charged on the spot. To make things worse, you can’t even get past the subscription page into the actual app. This is nothing but a scam and a waste of money … if I could give this a negative five star review…. | I read a review that said you can’t use the app without purchasing a subscription and then there are ads every two seconds. Hoping these were fixed, I installed the app. Nope. The other reviewer wasn’t kidding. There is no way to get past the premium screen. So I went ahead and “purchased” it but then couldn’t get past the ads. There is a button above the ad that says to continue to app. I selected that and it takes me back to the purchase screen. I did this already.  Ugh. I can’t tell you if the app works or not. Couldn’t get passed the ads and purchase screens. | This is a horrible app. When you open it, it will tell you to buy premium. There’s no way you can skip that! Oh, and to rub it in your face, the app will start showing you ads so they can profit from your patience. Even when you skip these ads, they’ll come back again in a couple seconds. What a horrible model! Use MapQuest instead. It’s amazing. | App just took my money keep taking me back and fourth to the trail page | I subscribed.  Then, i couldnt get passed the signup screen and it kept showing me adds. | Doesn’t speak directions. Charges to use but ever since I updated app I cannot access it. It brings up ads and when I bypass ad and click continue to app it just spins and doesn’t load and the one time it did go past that it took me to another ad. Total garbage app. | Took my money wasn’t able to use one time. Wish I could give less than one star | I open the app and it asks me if I want a free trial I click ok and then a Google ad pops up and it says my purchase was successful then another Google ad pops up and it’s back to the same free trial screen over and over again if I can’t use it when the bug is fixed I want to start my free trial again | Scam | App doesn’t work kept showing ads even though I subscribed and never got to see the app main page | I tried the free trial and loved it.  Purchased the year and it won’t let me into it. I have wrote the company with pictures of my purchase and no response. | Downloaded this and you gotta pay 4.99 a week to even see if it works. Plus you get 3 ads just starting up to get to the pay me first screen.

No helpful tip information anywhere.  Nothing but rabbit holes. | Using this will force you to feel like an idiot criminal for trying to buy tickets, imagine trying to do that. This forced us to miss an entire travel day. RiDICULOUS | The app improves with updates and age. It’s becoming very user friendly.  Continue to grow with improvements and the result will earn you five stars. | When I was recently in Belgium I used this app a few times and lived it. It allows you to plan ahead because it lays out all the departure and arrival schedules as well as connections | While using the app i was almost kicked off the train on 6 different occasions in 2 months due to the app refusing to show my ticket. before you get on the train i highly recommend taking a screenshot of the ticket to avoid any troubles with ticket checkers. | This is our first time using this app. It is very confusing. I agree with one of the other reviewers that information about having a pass should be available on the ticket. It is also confusing that all the journeys are listed as one trip. It is also awkward that the process of reserving seats is not intuitive. perhaps this is all explained in the small print somewhere, which I may have missed. I have not done the calculations, but it seems that reserving seats, when mandatory, can be expensive. The number of passengers on the trips where we were required to reserve seats at quite a high price did not warrant reservations at extra cost (there were many empty seats). The trains were clean and personnel very helpful and cheerful. | It’s had to describe how terrible this app is.  It doesn’t integrate with the Eurail web page. It can’t be used to reserve seats. It can’t be used to buy tickets if you don’t have a pass. But you have to use it to plan your trip. 

It’s probably fine for people who take the train regularly between a few different locations. But for tourists, it’s terrible. It only does one part of a complicated process for planning a multi city trip. The rest has to be done on the Eurail web page (with Google Maps open in another browser). And the web page is also poorly designed.  But you need the app so there is no incentive for Eurail to improve. | This app has made it so easy to plan our eura trip. | Downloaded the app to plan the trip so went to planner. Entered to and from and there were no trains. No way to reset it so I can look again. Worthless. | I have tried adding my journey to the trip about 20 times but it still does not allow me to connect my passes to that journey. It is very frustrating! It does it for some and not others. So now I have a pass for today, with an exclamation point asking me to add a journey to my trip so I can get the ticket, but nothing happens. It is totally bugged out. Worst app. | Europeans seethe and cope. In the time it takes to figure out these obnoxious trains I could have driven across this continent. App is garbage booking trains is garbage. Trying to reserve seats is literally impossible especially for the Spanish ones. Oh boy I only need 8 train tickets for a one way train journey for two people, so convenient and easy. Good thing I can only get 6 of them! It’s way better than driving or flying!!! | This app is a nightmare. Paid almost $400 and have to deal with the conductors not being able to scan the codes and wanting to throw us off or fine us all the time. What a joke. | This is the most confusing app I’ve ever used in my life and my entire life revolves around iPhone apps. From banking, to traveling, to social media type interactions to business emails. Everything is done on my iPhone. Yet when I got to this app, it was like deciphering hieroglyphics. The creators and administrators of this app should be fired. Why don’t you just mimic one of the travel apps? This is so unbelievably confusing and frustrating. I’m about to pull my hair out. I’ve spent a lot of money on this app, and I am now considering canceling my globalpass and simply flying from country to country. Buyer beware. You will not be happy. | Poor minimalism that doesn’t help user with nothing | I had high hopes for this app and pass, however they were quickly dashed. The entire process of using Eurail has been a nightmare from start to finish. From a lack of transparency to a lack of customer service, I have wasted so much money on this service. Do not get the pass, it is worse than useless and will actively cost you much more money than just buying tickets. I’ve traveled regularly and never had a travel experience as terrible as using Eurail. I’m so disappointed in what could’ve been a great product. | At no point in using this app has it worked. Paid almost $500 for 10 day pass. Inaccurate or missing train info, QR code/passes haven’t worked at all. workers at train station even told me the passes won’t scan. | If you do not constantly check for updates you will find yourself unable to access your pass this is extremely important for if you do not make sure to update your app every other day you will risk the chance of being kicked off a train because you cannot access your pass and then potentially stranded unable to update because your in the middle of Europe with no service | In Europe one needs a seat reservation for the fast trains. You can’t get one through the eurail app nor through the different train company’s apps. You have to go to the actual train station the train leaves from (in the Netherlands) and most towns have several stations. 

By the time I had traveled to the Netherlands and gotten to the correct station all the seats were taken. Yes, you can save money with a eurail pass, but you can’t always get the train on the day you want.

Also the ticket you need to show the conductor will only pop up on the day and hour of travel | Works fine, don’t see why everyone complains about it. | Do not purchase. You will never get to use the tickets to go where you want, as they only allow so many people with a pass to board. | Perfect to use if exploring Europe, but pay attention to what countries are and are not included. France is not included and messed up some things for us but this was on me. This app was amazing and every pass worked. When seat reservations are required the app made it pretty easy to get those reserved. | Like any organization with a monopoly Eurail/Interail is lazy, complacent and bad … this app is really bad, incompetently design, complicated to use, with too many steps to do anything. Just awful. If you see someone furiously poking at their phone near a railway station - it’s probably this App - or maybe it’s Eurail’s even worse website… which is also terrible. 

It’s so bad as to make one wonder, who’s responsible for such poor systems at Eurorail - I strongly recommend hiring competent replacements | Got the Eurail pass for me and my partner for 4 days after watching a video recommending it. We’ve spent over $500 on top of it to get reserved seats. Now we’ve spent over $2000 because we got stuck in Belgium. Be aware if you use a travel day the day of you can’t undo it and if the train is fully booked you’re screwed. Our trains to London are fully booked for the next three days so here we are in Belgium. I messaged their customer service just to get a reply saying “but you turned your travel day on did you not? What’s the problem?” Problem is we weren’t warned and now we are missing our flight home! We just got engaged and this trip has turned out soo awful. Not to mention i reserved seats on our first trip and we were charged but no reservation was made. Customer service told us to just hope for the best and plead with the conductor. | Cant log in, so have to put all the passports info manually again, which is a hazle if for multiple travelers. Also  very complicated to search for trains. It asks you to select a time and then says no trains available. Why wouldn’t it just give the options and you can pick? | Have encountered no issues. Works well both for planning and tickets. Only wish is that the booking reservations was integrated into the app itself and it would be nice to see real-time schedules especially in countries with delays (looking at you Italy) | I used a 4 day pass in the UK, Netherlands, and Germany and it worked well enough, especially when I had to string together regional trains. Aside from it sending me notifications about disruptions affecting the other side of Europe from where I was traveling (which it still does now despite my pass having expired), my only other issue that I ran into was the bike that I was traveling with. Where bike reservations are required, I found the best solution was just going into a ticket office and talking to an actual person. I could usually get one for the same day but it did require flexibility. I don’t think there’s an option to make a bike reservation in the app, but that seems more like an issue with the various train operators than eurail/interrail. I also didn’t have to get a seat reservation so I can’t speak to that side of things. All in all, I would get it again. I think that it pays for itself in the UK, on high speed trains, or any other expensive trains. I’d check prices between the operator and the pass first though. | This is the least user-friendly app I have ever used.  They could make this sooo much easier to use.  Basic programming would fix this app and make it easier to use.  As it is, it’s pathetic and shameful. | This app is really horrible. The layout of the whole thing is confusing and half the time the listed time for a train departure isn’t even right. This app gives you the hardest path to travel wherever you need to go - and if you want to find any alternative routes then that’s up to you. Why doesn’t the app give multiple routes to get to a certain place? This app is unfinished and overall a jumbled mess. They really need to fix and update this app! | I've been using the Eurail app for a while now, and I must say, it's been nothing short of a frustrating experience. The app's constant glitches and breakdowns make it nearly impossible to rely on when planning my train journeys. Not to mention, the app's tendency to provide incorrect train prices has led me to overspend on more than one occasion.

But that's not all – there have been instances where the app simply fails to display any train prices at all, leaving me in the dark about the costs associated with my travel plans. And let's not forget the user interface, which is nothing short of confusing. Navigating through the app feels like a never-ending maze, with the added annoyance of being randomly bounced from one menu to another.

I had high hopes for the Eurail app to simplify my travel arrangements, but it has consistently fallen short of my expectations. I find myself dreading each time I have to use it, fearing yet another technical hiccup or frustrating user experience. It's a shame that an app with so much potential has ended up being such a headache to use. I sincerely hope the developers take these issues seriously and work to improve the app's functionality and user interface. Until then, I'll be exploring other options for my travel planning needs. | Do not waste your $$$ on Eurail passes. We spent a lot of $$ for a family of 7 to have passes and were not once able to ride a train with them. Eurail says we can’t get a refund even though we  never used our passes because they were “activated” and there seems to be no way to deactivate them.  They will let you reserve a train that you can’t take and reserving a seat is an extremely difficult process. We could never reserve a seat from their app. When we went to the Barcelona train station to reserve seats on a train we got tickets for months in advance, they said they could not do it. At the Paris station, we were informed that the train we wanted couldn’t even be used with a Eurail past despite their app letting us get tickets. Overall a TERRIBLE experience. Run away! | Out of the blue I couldn’t use my ticket despite having a trip planned. I turned on the travel day a million times, updates the app and still nothing. Lucky I haven’t got kicked off this train yet | This app is maddening. Trying to make reservations you are redirected to another app, it's super frustrating. And they have had routes up until December 9th for months, and we keep waiting for later in December with no updates for months. | I thought this app seemed great at first, automatic rout planner that will handle connections and tell you when seat reservations are required. After using this app for an extended trip in Europe, it’s clear that the first impression is not an accurate one.

The app will routinely show your saved journeys and travel day ticket QR codes as blank if you have anything but the fastest internet speeds available. This is fine if you can patiently reload the page a few times, but when you’re on the train and scrambling to pull up your pass when the conductor is walking through to scan tickets, have fun explaining that you actually do have a travel day on the pass and the app is just trash! 

The real kicker, though, are the timetables. If the app claims that a train exists, you better verify that the train *actually* exists through some other rail tracker. I routinely found “free” train routes that actually required seat reservations, trains that didn’t actually stop at the stations they claimed, or trains that just outright did not exist—on any time table. It was fun to go to an information desk in the Brussels station to find out that the train I was relying on to make a connection hasn’t stopped at my desired station since 2020!

This is completely unacceptable for an app like this. I hope they can get their act together in the future. For now, you have been warned. | This is a poorly designed app and the company itself hasn't properly integrated with there partners which results in the customers (you) being vulnerable to train fines and wasted travel days. Their customer service, while admittedly quick to response, blames their customers for not reading the fine print - when in reality they should just improve the operations and functionality of their business/app.

I bought a first class pass and for my first trip had to stand on a train for 3 hours because it was so crowded. 

My second trip I got a fine because even though I thought I purchased the appropriate ticket through a third party, interrails instructions were unclear. Paid for the fine and used a travel day for nothing.. Customer supposed told me to “read the fine print” and didn't reward me the unused (but lost) travel day.

I didn't purchase this app/pass to spend time reading legal briefs, I purchased it to make my life easier... That was a mistake.

It only got worse. You plan trips that result in missed trains. You end up purchasing a ticket nearly every trip anyway. (I.e. The amount of tickets you'd need to purchase to make up for the cost of the pass is impossible). You spend hours fumbling through the app and planning with limited options - only to be sent to another place to purchase the tickets because none are included in the app! 

To summarize. Bad app. Unclear instructions that result in fines. Misrepresented benefits. Unhelpful and rude customer support. You pay for every ticket/trip anyway. Doesn't save time or convenience. 

I wish I would've noticed the terrible rating prior to downloading the app and purchasing a pass. Never again. | I paid €280 for 4 travel days and man, what a rip off! 

Not only do they not tell you that reserving seats is essentially buying 1/2 if not full price on another ticket (what’s the point of even buying the pass??) but to reserve a seat is so incredibly pain staking and counterproductive that it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. 

Eurorail is an overpriced and down right shady organization that should be more open about seat reservations. 

Coming from a guy that literally could not get into Paris from Brussels, 2 MAJOR cities in Europe because everything is reserved seating. What’s the point of paying almost 300 euros when it’s cheaper just to buy individual tickets. This was made for people who are misinformed and new to traveling europe. Don’t be a fool, just do your research. This is not the cheapest option or the easiest for that matter. | I tried this on both an iPhone 12 and an iPad 9.  In both cases the screen design made it impossible to make certain selections like continue and go to checkout. | This app is terrible.  Do not use it.  I’m not sure if it’s a scam or if the creators are just inept but DO NOT USE this service.  I see Eurail customer service responding to all of these negative reviews with about 4 paragraphs of how to use the app and what the user could be doing better.  If you need that much explanation, it’s because your app isn’t intuitive, and is therefore, bad.  I also saw the app marketed as the most flexible way to travel, but a customer service person responded to a review saying you need to book high speed trains months in advance.  That means it’s not flexible. 

Just buy your tickets direct from the rail service, or maybe try omio or some other app (idk I just saw another user suggesting that), but I can’t stress enough, DO NOT BUY anything from this company. | I have never left a review for an app - but this one is so bad I felt the need to warn other travelers.  We selected this all for more flexibility in using trains across countries.  However, as all of the other reviews state, this app is incredibly difficult to use.  Customer service is NON EXISTENT- there is nobody to ask questions to.  Call the 800 number - it hangs up on you. The website and app do not sync - so anything you do online does not transfer to the app.  You can’t reserve a seat on the app, which is a total nightmare.  Your QR code won’t work anywhere.   Proceed with caution. | I'm very disappointed with this APP.  Good idea, but bad execution.  I spent a lot of time entering my trip details on the Eurail web site, but iypt didn't transfer to the APP.  My Global Pass doesn't show up as aQR code so conductor can scan.  Seat reservations bought on the web site don's show up on the APP.  This APP needsa lot of work. | App won’t show that seats are taken until you use the website. The tickets on the app will often unregister themselves so I have to redownload the app (annoying and stressful if already on the train). Sometimes this doesn’t even work and the app has removed my tickets from the system. Super stressful, Poorly designed. | This | So we thought it would be great to get a several day pass and it has been a nightmare. The seat reservation system is outrageous and even though many of the trains have open seats they don’t have any more seat reservations so you can’t actually book the train you need. 

So I still had to buy a single ticket even though I had this pass so when I went to go get a refund because I couldn’t even use this past to get the train ticket I needed they’re only offering a 50% refund even though they say you can get a full refund if you cancel the pass before activation which this is. This company is stealing hundreds of dollars for me and has wasted hours of my time. To all my fellow Americans I highly suggest you do not buy these scam passes, just buy individual passes it will save you so much time and money. | Easily the most terrible app I’ve used. Completely useless. | When you buy a pass, it comes with a number of “travel days” - attempting to get a pass for a train ride uses up a travel day. Using that travel day up does not guarantee you anything. At all. Some rides require “reservations,” but the app does not allow you to place reservations. Neither does the Eurail website, in many instances. Would you like to spend $350 to go nowhere? This is the app for you. If you’re a normal person, and that sounds terrible, avoid this app. | One of the biggest issues with the app, as others have said, is the bug where saved trips disappear and reappear randomly. This happened multiple times on different trains when the attendant came by. Luckily, many of them said they are totally accustomed to the app being unreliable, so awkward situations were usually avoided. | It issued a ticket of a train I specified and said “You are all set.”  When I got to the station, I was not able to board because there is no seat and seat reservation is a must.  Why did they even issue me a boarding ticket with a barcode  if they cannot confirm a seat?  If there is extra step to book a seat, why don’t they provide instructions in the app?   Eventually with help in the station I had to find multiple slow trains that did not require seat booking, and the route became 10 hours instead of 3. | The UI takes some learning since it is unnecessarily convoluted. Decrease the number of steps to add trips to the ticket and show the QR code, please. | What a worthless app.  You should be able to make seat reservations directly in the app.   It’s an embarrassing experience and the developers should be ashamed. | App does not allow you to make seat reservations for trains even though there is a section for it…, tried doing it on the website and that didn’t work either. Needs an update, it causes a lot of stress but you need to do it. | Not only has it consumed a significant and disproportionate amount of my planning time, it has cost me extra in having to buy tickets for times that are not supported through their process. 

The kicker is the inability of the app to pull in itineraries that have been booked on their website. AND they penalize you to have paper tickets. Need a seat reservation? Hope you packed a printer. This is taking me back to when you had to print your own boarding passes.

I just have 3 requests 1) option to display standard time vs military 2) option to switch between dark and light themes or color customization 3) option to hide or collapse fields/sections (ie. Photo section or map section 4) ability to print or download final itinerary to.pdf 

*Also the desktop login does not seem to be functioning properly. | I’m a weirdo who really likes lists. I like to list everything I do, especially the goals or accomplishments I want to make. I have searched for and downloaded dozens of similar apps and ALL of them fell short. This has all the features I want, no monthly subscription, just a one time purchase for all features, and the app just looks really good! I cannot recommend enough! | It seems to be a decent app. I’m debating purchasing the premium version. I like that it is not subscription based. You can add pictures and go about 3 levels deep on goal/list management. Makes for a nice visual board. However I would love to see some additions before fully committing. The ability to add/edit categories would be nice. Current categories are broad and generic. I group my goals differently than what’s offered. If there is a way to do it, I am missing it. Also, if I put my goal in a list or trip it disappears from goals. The default view is “Lists” that display ‘Trip’, ‘List’, and ‘Goal’. I would like to see my goals regardless of where I group them. To be able to see a full list of goals that I can sort by date would be ideal. Sometimes a high level view is necessary. It would be nice to have start and end dates for goals as well. You can only have a start and end for a Trip. Some goals span months and the ability to be able to utilize dates would be nice. The app freezes and crashes sometimes too. It seems buggy. Nice app, but potential to be great. | App works better now I can make lists with my friends fast responses aswell! | Overall new favorite planning app! This is the visualization planning app I’ve been wanting for some time. Great way to do long term goal/list planning & I’ve tried them all! Paid for premium version soon after using a bit. Much worth it. A few issues/suggestions & bug fixes that could make it PERFECT & would make me change my review to 5 stars!!
Can’t manually re-order lists, goals, trips or sort them by dates/progress/etc. makes hard to organize to fullest potential
Ability to view all tasks/goals by due dates in one screen to see all upcoming goals/tasks
Ability to schedule goals with future date (only goes up to current date..)
Accidentally tapping anywhere outside of new goal causes you to lose entry without any confirmation
Ability for portrait view on iPad
The & and + characters don’t work in titles/details 
Broken words in list cards after 11 characters with no hyphen or text resizing on iPad
Edits/adds done on iPhone only show on iPad after quitting & restating app
Map titles are in different language on English mode | it’s okay | It won’t let you add a URL to capture important details like hours of operation and address. Very surprising miss. | It’s missing 3 key features that are a essential for making these goals actually happen... 

First: the app doesn’t allow you to schedule your goals on a calendar, so the only way you can view your goals is in lists and buckets which are great for those planning things years away however not great if you want to make a goal and reach it this week, month or year.

Second: the apps ‘scheduling’ feature doesn’t allow you to add a time just a date which means I have to use one app to “set my goal” and another to “schedule” my goal and actually get my goal on my agenda for the coming days weeks or months.

Third: big goals take a team - if more than one user can share their goals, lists, tasks, and trips - as well as a calendar - this would be the best tool ever hands down. I use Trello and Microsoft 365 and this would be my preference if it had a calendar & share features for a team to plan & reach together. 

Room for improvement but I enjoy it for “dreaming” about my goals more than “planning” the achieve them. | I mean,who wants to see someone’s info?I can destroy them on social media,and even if it says four and up,I saw some really mature things on ther that should be informed to kids,and some of them are really NASTY.Therefore this is a DIRTY app which you shall not install,is that clear? | Nice way to manage my travel goals. Offline mode would be a nice addition. | Neat concept, but it feels incomplete yet. I loved the layout and design of it - but when it came to the UX of adding to the bucketlist, updating your story, or adding photos - it was just poor execution.

Efficient and saves time. | I was able to put in all the addresses for my patient visits, and it put each one in the correct placement according to distance. You can also have it put it in according to time if you want to. Quite a timesaver when you really don’t know where some of the addresses are. | How have I gotten by without this app! It works perfectly! | 👍🏼😳😳 | So easy to use, does great routes and even has a section where you can take a picture of your delivery and get a signature!!! | Best app hands down | Easy to use and a big help doing a route for a non-profit. | As of their new update 2/19/24 this app is ruined. You can no longer do anything for free, you used to be able to make an unoptimized route for free. 
I used to use their optimization, but their optimization wasn’t even of quality, it never took traffic into consideration, and it was always slower routing than Google. 
Also, I used to be able to select more than one favorite locations at a time so I could make my whole route quite simply but now I have to select each one, and then it bounces you back to the main, and then the select each one again.
I sincerely wish there was a way to revert this. This update is terrible and has ruined an app that I used on the daily. 
Also, why is there no option to have a one time payment this is ridiculous to have to pay a monthly fee.
Of course, they have to have a monthly payment for no reason instead of just paying a flat rate. | This app makes my days at work so much easier then before I started using it. It takes the guessing out of the equation. | Best route planner app ever | 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 | Very pleased. Definitely saves time versus having to optimize your route manually | I was liking the new update but now I can’t enjoy the app without having to pay a monthly or yearly subscription. It was cool to be able to choose to optimize it or not. Now I have to pay. I don’t mind supporting and paying a one time fee but $10 a month or $80 a year!? It used to be free. | This is a great app. I enjoy this better than road warrior.  There is a feature I would love to see.
 In the settings menus it would be nice to have a option for the person to set times and color, so once you put the address in with the time, it will automatically add the color to stop.  Yes I know you can do that when you add the stop but to have it preset for all future stops will be great. | This app is Sooo much better than any other of similar platforms. Saves me miles and is quite accurate. | You won’t be disappointed. I drive school buses and this app has help me so much with transporting student. Only if this could be compatible to the GPS tablets on the bus. This is be amazing. | Very difficult to navigate. No instructions how to return to a previous rote. Just a mess | Sin duda alguna esta es la app para rutas con múltiples destinos q más me ha gustado. Es fácil de usar, la interfaz es increíble y sobre todo es muy precisa. No tengo más q agradecimiento a los desarrolladores de esta maravilla. Muchas gracias. ☺️. Se las recomiendo sin falta | The best app I ever have | Can’t ad muilty locations | This app is a LIFE SAVER! I stumbled across it the day before starting a new job with NO KNOWLEDGE regarding the delivery/logistics world and I am confident on day 3 thanks to this app! | Have used route systems in this one by far is easy to use | Never take one out of order , it deleted everything after that and nothing worked right ‘ horrible app | ❤️ | Wasted hours yesterday as the app took me back to a previous route with no way to get to the last route. Today, same thing. Very disappointed. | This app saved me. I was put on a new route that I was completely unfamiliar with. I found this app and have been using it daily. A small learning curve which is expected. But overall easy and user friendly. I totally recommend this!! | Helps me finish my route | Best driving app I have ever used | Works very well - reporting was more inclusive of data entered for the stops !! Would recommend
To anyone doing multi stop deliveries- this has saved me many extra miles | Was a good app, but now it is paid subscription only so will be deleted beware | Seriously the maze I was in before I started using this app, it cut my driving time in half! | It was a great app until the dreaded limited features popped up unless you subscribe for $9.99/month. On to the next one. | One of the most easiest and intuitive apps I’ve ever used for a road delivery and droppings. | Great way to organize your driving routes and it helps you have the best time saving! 100% recommended if need for any driving back to back with picking up employees or just customer in general! | This app has changed the delivery business hallelujah | To start a route seems very difficult to navigate. Optimizing a route must be done after u start a route but, actually starting a route should be much easier to find and go! Once you figure it out the app works great but, each route build is difficult to start. | Sometimes my addresses are for 2 drivers and sometimes 3. I visually look at the mapping to divide up addresses for my drivers. But Is there a setting to optimize addresses into 2 or 3 routes? Rather than a single route by default? | I really love this app it makes my day so much easier. | This app is the bomb!! Cutting hours from my delivery route. | Organized my stops, saved a lot of time!  It really is very good! | I’ve been doing this since 2009 and the routes don’t make sense.  They don’t follow time guidelines and backtrack alot. | I’ve tried other “highly” rated ones, but this one is the most user friendly and flexible. As  I’m newly using it, I’m discovering features that were just well thought out and it’s intuitive to use.
Seriously, thank you for its creation and for making my life easier!! | 1) I would like to be able to delete any route I want. The “you can’t delete this route” should never come up

2) I would like an “add a route” option? I’m sorry but I feel like this shouldn’t have to be said. You have “repeat route” “duplicate route” and “continue ride” and of course the “delete route” that you can use if it’s in the correct position. I’m not a developer but if I want to clear out all routes and have 0 and then push a little + symbol to add my first and only route it shouldn’t be that difficult. I prefer a clean environment and just gave up trying to figure out which routes I can delete. 

3) when adding/editing Places the keyboard doesn’t go away and blocks the screen example: if I edit the name the keyboard comes up and then scroll to service time the keyboard doesn’t go away and makes it impossible to select the time. So you have to exit the screen and go back in to set the time

I pay for the monthly subscription but am looking for something more polished. I have used this app 5 days a week for the last 4 months and still struggle to navigate it. Maybe it’s me. | Was working fine then all of a sudden, wouldn’t let me check done. Then after a few stops wouldn’t let me navigate. So till it gets fixed 3 stars. | It allows me to plan the delivery route quicker so everything is ready by the time the delivery driver arrives. Very user friendly app. Deserves all stars. | The app is very accurate.

The journal option (capture photos that correspond to date, time, and waypoint location) is an amazing capability. | Always happy with the user interface, very handy with estimated driving time and easy to share itinerary with friends. I tried google trip and I’m just not as impressed. I recently ran into problems not being able to add scenic spots to my itinerary, sent them a user feedback with details, they responded quickly and resolved it within 2 days. I rarely see app that attentive to user feedbacks. Great job Funliday! | Love how I can share and others get to be able to input to the itinerary such an awesome app. | This is truly the best trip planning app. I’ve been using this for a few years now for every trip. Back then I literally tried 10 or so apps and none of them did what I needed. This one had a couple glitches, but it was so close to great and was still the best so I stuck with it. Customer service also fixed/enhanced some items quickly at my request. Now, the app works perfectly and does exactly what I need it to do. I tell everyone about it! Thank you for making this app! Also, I looove that you can share it with friends/family and they can make real-time updates to it as well! | This app used to work really well and was amazing for planning trips.  I used to be able to look up places and attractions easily and add them to my plans for each day but now adding attractions takes a long time to load.  Also, the app used to quickly determine transportation time based on whatever transportation mode I selected, and now it never figures it out.  Finally, I used to be able to easily move and rearrange the order of places to visit but now everything gets messed up when I try to do that.  When I first started using it I would have given it 5 stars but now I would give it zero if I could.  This app used to be perfect and now it is basically useless. | This app is great as everyone traveling in the group can see the plans on a given day. However, it’s difficult to have more than one activity in a day because it doesn’t let you set a start time for anything but the first activity. After that it assumes you are going directly to the next place. A little annoying as trips frequently have down time in between. | This is the first time using the app and am planning two trips simultaneously. I like it for the most part, once I figured it out it got easier. I am not able to edit the days, my travel partner imputed the wrong start date so that’s something I have to work around. Overall a pretty cool way for everyone to add to the itinerary and make the most of the trip!! | If I’m planning a trip to multiple cities it would be super useful to search and select a city vs a specific attraction. I thought at first this is what would happen when I selected a day and a map came up. Nothing happens when you do that. You can roam around in the map, but there is no ability to simply select a city as a way point. | I typically like using this app over TripIt. I like that it routes my activities on the maps and gives me allotted times of days depending on my duration. I like that it’s color coded by day. I like that it shows the drive time from one place to another. However....I would LOVE this app if it could Integrate our flights and hotel information and information of attractions, like tripit does. I would also like to edit an attraction by clicking it and assigning times by the minute. | 感謝設計這個軟體！唯一美中不足的地方是不知道為什麼每次電腦網頁版的起始日期總是比app版的日期提前一天呢？（是因為系統自動調整為台灣時區嗎？） | I’ve been using Google Trips and it did a lot of things well, but it’s itinerary mapping features are lacking and this app has been very useful in completing the job Google left undone. There is room for improvement here but in general very useful. | 如果附近景點能以（假如有前一筆資料的話）上一筆資料的附近景點做搜索的話就會更好了。往往使用者可能在旅程前就規劃！ | Easy to use! Thanks for the help in planning our family reunion!! | This was the best app to help with planning my vacation! I tell everyone to get it now! | Really good interface, nice functionality. | Super easy to arrange your travel schedule with your friends or family even your enemy! Lol nice app!! | As an avid traveler, I am VERY impressed with all this app has to offer and the hours it will save me with all of its amazing features! | Edit: My travel partner contacted the app developers and got an almost-immediate response.  They fixed the invite so that we were able to share the trip and though currently only the primary trip planner can make changes, that fix is coming. I'm excited to see what can be remedied. 

Well, I like the idea and the format, but there were a couple issues.  First I successfully was invited by a friend but when I attempted to invite her on the trip I had already set up, she never got the invite. Also, in an attempt to circumvent that I was going to add all of my itinerary to her trip but the app states I don't have permission to edit while not allowing her the option to grant permission. :-/ | Good app | It's super convenient to combine all the info together and google map. I love it's flexibility, can work offline and super easy to share with others. | Overall this app is excellent for creating a trip itinerary--using the app is fairly intuitive, and only takes a little while (10 min for me?) to figure out what you really need to start planning your trip. I especially appreciate the integration with Google maps (I think that's what it uses), and how you can save specific addresses (even residential ones) with nicknames (aliases). The developers have a good product with great potential :)

There are only two issues preventing me from giving the app 5 stars:
1) The travel time estimation feature for public transit in Japan (the area for which I am planning) doesn't work. As of this writing, the app only estimates driving time between locations (and sometimes walking times...but that's not exactly realistic when I need to go 30-40 km as quickly as possible). If this feature worked, it would help me greatly in realistically planning how many places I can actually visit in a day. 
2) The pop-up notification asking me to turn on location services comes up too often. Every single time I want to search or add a destination, it reminds me to turn location on. I prefer having it off, because having all the ""nearby places"" listed is distracting (and irrelevant right now, since I'm in a different country than the trip I'm planning for). Having the pop-up appear only when the app is opened would make for a much smoother, less annoying user experience. 

Aside from those two areas for improvement, I am really impressed with this app and thankful to the creators! | 還算好用的app，但有一些小功能不是那麼順手。 | I never could get this app to work. Very complicated and not at all useful. | 非常好用的規劃軟體，很適合 | Really useful!! | Overall it's a good app, user friendly.
One way it can be better is by letting us to add some notes into it rather than just adding location of here and there..
looking forward for improvements..
=] | This app is so cool. It really helpful for me, and help to efficiently manage my trip a lot. Even a short trip, I could be easy to handle it and change my schedule. Just a very easy step, I can set up my trip schedule, and search new hot spot.",4.55,80,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/1e/15/ad/1e15adef-5bbe-9321-9341-4d26dd378f14/67f131fa-590d-4bd6-8b72-941a1d24c0b7_screenshot_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/26/64/b7/2664b762-ebee-89c1-86d2-37444d311e59/0931301f-0f72-451b-9ec7-03ea50d1eb9a_screenshot_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/85/da/67/85da670f-11b8-b1b5-90e0-8a73f0bb22fe/9f0d858a-b81a-4d43-8610-703c3129f75f_screenshot_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/af/04/22/af0422b3-e1a5-1fb0-29d4-3bc62fed3255/6fc3799b-5970-4ad8-8078-7a238607f3a2_screenshot_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/4e/d0/59/4ed0595c-bde4-7c5f-4fa0-517859dd19fb/eaa3e67a-f405-4c8b-9117-fff0f33d6475_screenshot_05.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

After trying many different options to generate the same trip, they are 99% same. It’s very disappointing honestly. I understand the the resources need to get paid but simply don’t worth it while lots of small destinations are still unavailable. You possibly get better results from ChatGPT or Gemini for free. Truly don’t recommend it unless there are core updates, otherwise wouldn’t waste money again or time for now. | Malisimo. Voy a Reikiavik y me sugiere que vaya al parque nacional que esta a 45 kilómetros para una visita de dos horas a partir de las 20.00…
Una estafa, mucho de artificial y poco de inteligencia… | So far very unimpressed. | This app has major problems. I purchased one month to try it out and that was a mistake. Instead of NorthCarolina, it gave me Houston. I would like my money back.  I used it for 15 mins. and got entirely frustrated with all the inaccurate locations. | I was led to think this app would help me choose a destination, but you already need to know your destination, and your dates before you can even begin to search. No help at all. | A very cool concept for an app but it wasn’t working for me. I was trying to plan a 10 day trip to Denver with normal spending and a variety of interest. All the app showed me was a few dinky, city parks and a cowboy museum…for Denver, Colorado. Every time I tried to proceed the app encountered an error and then I couldn’t proceed. | I love this app because is simple and clear but I like to get more free AI features. | This app is really hard and useless. I need some customization. Save button on iOS is almost impossible. I can not add activities to the desired time because it collides with others. One example, I have an activity set for 5 hours (this time was added automatically) because I can not update duration even it it says “success”. I can not add activity because time match with the 5 hours one.

I would like my money back | I used this to try and plan a family trip to Honolulu; however the content it gives despite changing parameters is very subpar. I would like for the app to regenerate other items if you delete from the itinerary. It’s a cool concept but still lacks in execution. Got frustrated with the app and deleted it. It makes you pay $4 to use it; not much but still disappointed with it. | Very nice app | Need very specific info on travel . Can use the internet much easier . Airfare and hotels . | I was planning a trip to San Francisco and wanted some good recommendations for my trip with my spouse. The app asks you detailed questions about what you are looking for but when given the results, it doesn’t seem like it accurately recommends based on your selections. When adjusting my selections, it gave me the exact same itinerary. It’s unfortunate that I had to pay for this experience but at least it was only around $4. | Makes you pay $5 before you can even use it and generated “error status 500” every single time i tried to create an itinerary. Waste of almost $5 for literally nothing. | They ruined the app after obliging you to pay even though last weeks there were some major cities for free and now u need to pay | Unless you are going to a major city, don’t pay for this. It’s idea of relaxing, nature and adventure was a tour of playgrounds for me. | I can’t believe Mexico City is not included in this app. | Cant even open it :( | So beautiful app | Not let me add more trips. Only the first one. | My initial usage was good | They are not ready to lounge the app. It has less than 10 cities . | Wow this app is amazing! The auto mapping made planning my Paris trip so much easier. I loved the recommendations too | I think the app is great… perfect for travel and it really is super well designed but there are still many countries and cities to add 😭 | Just downloaded, went to find suggestions for my next trip and 3 out of 3 cities I searched didn't have suggestions. Deleting app | Crashed 2 times when tried to build an itinerary | When I click on the images I am unable to close it. The X on the top right shows but does nothing. I have to close the app and start again. | I just downloaded it for my coming trip to Honolulu in Hawai’i. Not in the app yet, even though it’s one of the top vacation spots in the world. I tried México city, the largest megalopolis in the western hemisphere and it is not there either. It’s several months or years from being useful. Three stars because the concept is great but it lacks content. | I’m so excited about this app where I can planning my next journal. | Great starting point if you want to get a quick tour plan suggestion | Works cool, limited to mostly euro destinations. Stick to Reddit | Love it ! | Good for start planning places you never visit | Pretty sure that’s illegal | kinda boring just feels like it was built by a bunch of engineers. don’t feel like any of the suggestions are cool | If I wanted to go to the same destinations everyone is is traveling to, why do I need ai? Albania is not offered. | Cannot find any city. | Doesn’t work for any cities! Gives a 502 error. Can’t even send feedback. | I have mixed feelings about iPlan.ai. On the one hand, I appreciate the app's concept of helping travelers create itineraries for their trips. However, I was disappointed to find that the app only works for a limited number of cities. If you're planning a trip to a major tourist destination, then you're likely to find something useful in iPlan.ai. But if you're traveling to a less popular location, then you might be out of luck.
Additionally, the app could benefit from more features, such as the ability to create itineraries for multiple cities. It would also be great if the app could use your current location to suggest nearby attractions and activities. Overall, I think iPlan.ai has potential, but it needs to expand its city selection and add more features to truly be a useful tool for travelers. For these reasons, I can only give the app two stars. | Stuck on 100% loading screen. Killed the app and the generated results were there. 

When I scroll down on my planned day, it sends me to the previous days plan. Did this for not all but multiple days . Keeps sending me to the previous day so I can’t see what is planned towards the end of some days. 

Buggy and rushed - last pushed update 10 months ago | There is a lack of good places in the app in each city i know | Helpful | Can’t close any attraction image opened in iPhone 11 Max pro. | Nice and easy app to use | If you’re looking to plan a vacation and need some inspiration this app is for you. | I really love the application because it is so easy to use. I got my travel plan for Istanbul and it was great. Thanks iplan.ai | I like the idea, I think if there is an option to choose restaurants and meal break location by our taste and wishes it could be better. For example i can check what kind of foods and restaurants i like to try and the app could offer them between programs. Or if there is a restaurant with high ranking in nearby of our visiting locations it could be suggested by app. And also if there is an option to choose type of shopping mall and location of we prefer modern locations or traditional shopping spot, or type of stuffs we are looking to buy, for example if i give a high score to shopping app ask me what i want to shop, suits or sport clothes and by my prefer it could give better options. | loved the idea and will use in the next trip👌 | The concept is exciting can’t wait to test it on my next trip.",4.46356,988,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/20/9f/46/209f4665-c2ee-a0a1-061c-b33bff1aa8e6/c6f2d824-f263-45f3-9a94-03f782525fe9_00-video.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/dc/be/8c/dcbe8cf1-0c4e-911b-239f-e64218955b07/143a62c4-a7ef-48be-9459-d4371aece6bc_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/96/6a/a9/966aa912-942f-5839-7abd-fadc53ff252f/508766bb-34f6-4844-886f-7c9e82aa02c1_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f2/c0/17/f2c01795-d0bc-c102-4a2b-3c0a9f23e782/c405c0df-d0c7-4685-aa0e-3be2bf2a3bc3_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f7/93/49/f79349a4-2f12-35aa-6ac5-91ddc2d6565f/671e84fc-fd14-461a-b12b-90891490dcfc_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6e/37/86/6e3786d1-f17c-0175-d8a7-183d213d08f5/4c23e7ad-bad2-47c2-b04d-5dec3552312d_05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/04/37/77/043777ae-1307-9c49-793a-7ec8c24463d7/4cfb5529-9c91-4628-9ea8-e76cb2467251_06.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Eg. Our Family Holiday, Road Trip with the fellas, Hawaiian Getaway, Jessica’s Bachelorette Party, Dream Overseas Vacation, Rob and Debs Wedding etc.


Add Items or Import Bookings :

Start planning by adding a list of things you want to do as itinerary items or Import existing bookings from different suppliers as items by sending supplier email confirmations to go@lyfshort.com ... Catch a flight? stay in accommodation? meet friends? Sight See? Go for drinks? Hire a Car? etc.

Research & Record :

Research online, save screenshots, bookmarks and text straight back to each activity for future reference and group sharing.


Expense Planning and Management :

Plan a budget then record pre/during/post trip expenses, individually and across a group. (Includes automated currency conversion & expense split calculator).


Invite & Share :

Get the group together, invite participants and co-organisers with simple SMS, email and social media links. Then share itinerary details, research, expenses, images and bookmarks with the group.


Message & Collaborate :

Communicate in real-time using group messaging linked back to each specific activity for quick, easy reference.


Location & Transit Mapping :

Use integrated Google Maps within Lyfshort to quickly find locations when planning then save point to point transit routes for guidance when the trip comes along.


Share Photos :

Participants now have a central place to upload and download photos taken before, during and after the Trip or Event, all saved together with the details. This is also great for finding the photos months or years later rather than searching thousands mixed together on a device.


Device Calendar Sync :

Manage activity times and dates in one place by syncing Lyfshort itinerary details and your mobile device calendar.


Export Itineraries :

Save as a PDF.  Share with people that may not be participating in the activity, save offline or print as a hard copy.

Handle all your travel planning, too. Find and book great deals on flights, explore transportation and lodging options, and plan your entire journey.

Vacation planning, redefined

Once you’re booked on a cruise, plan your entire vacation from the app. Reserve shore excursions for every port, purchase or upgrade beverage packages for endless toasts, and internet packages to stay connected while at sea, though the app is free to use on ship Wi-Fi. 

Put together a relaxing spa day... or days... and make dining reservations at distinctive specialty restaurants. Explore other pre-cruise deals in the casino, check out VIP Passes and make your cruise truly special with gifts and gear. And don’t forget to link reservations with your travel party so you can make plans together. 

Set sail like a pro

As your cruise approaches, use the app to check-in and qualify for the fastest boarding experience. Before you head to the terminal on boarding day, begin your mandatory safety briefing and access your set sail pass. 

To plan all the fun, find all the shows and activities in the Daily Planner and build your personalized calendar. We’ll even remind you with a notification when you have plans. 

Be sure to smile for the camera because you’ll be able to view, purchase and download your photos right from the app (on select ships). Use the app to find your way around with detailed deck maps and chat with your travel party through group or 1-on-1 chats. You can track your onboard expenses in the app (or not... you’ll be on vacation, after all) and learn how to book your next cruise while onboard for the best deals. 

After your cruise, you can continue to track your loyalty status and perks, keep up with the latest and greatest from our family of brands in the video library, and start planning and booking your next cruise. Because we know this won’t be your last! 

More than a cruise app

Make sure you turn on auto-updates, so you can keep up with all the ways we improve the app for all your travel needs. Features may vary from ship to ship. App is free to download and use. In-app purchases available. Once onboard, connect to your ship's guest Wi-Fi. No internet package required.

Feel like it helps me to know what’s going on in all resturants, and has all other important information I need, it helped to make check in a breeze! Thanks celebrity! | The celebrity app is so convenient and easy to navigate | Limited info but overall good | App doesn’t reflect updates from website, e.g, credits; doesn’t auto populate reservation number in the manage reservation page. | This being my maiden voyage on any line, I cannot express how all of my expectations have been met and surpassed!  The courtesy of the crew is an indication of extensive training geared toward making the guest their first priority.  Meals, entertainment, excursions, have left me awestruck!!  Thank you Celebrity Apex for possibly my best vacation EVER!!! | You still can’t find menus for all the specialty restaurants, no room service menu for suites, but the other categories have a menu. Luminae menu has changed several times, now not showing lobster at all on the last chic night. We sail in a few weeks and it seems like it hasn’t updated, not even showing any entertainment/activities, nothing. | This is not a friendly app.  Things are hard to find.  I think any items that were bought separately should show up too. | Terrible terrible | I have two cruises booked. I cannot see a way to switch between them. | Why doesn’t all three cruise show mass is our last cruise we are on the summit right now and I can’t bring it up | I have ask you for the 3rd day to email
Me my excursions on my may 6 cruise out of Barcelona to Athens and have not received a reply | Trying to book several events on the app and the web site. Gave called help desk twice, no one knows what’s going on. | When the app works, it’s great. Only problem is it doesn’t work most of the time. | I get a time to update App, sends me to App Store , no choice to update 
It’s a cycle of not being able to log in and not able to update 
I expect Royal are losing millions where passengers cannot access the app to purchase items | I have an older iPhone 8 and I can’t update to ISO 17, therefore my apps aren’t working, I have two upcoming cruises, one on RCCL And one on Celebrity. I shouldn’t have to get a new phone to take on a cruise!!!!! The latest update on my phone is 16.7.7 | Please allow iOS 16.7.7 to use this app.  Starting today it keeps popping up that I must update my app but can’t.   Thank you. The older phones are not on iOS 17. | Needs work | Easy to navigate | Missing dinner reservations
Password has to be changed too frequently 
Times do not match up with times provided by Retreat Concierge | App freezes, won’t access account information or reservations | The whole trip was perfect!  Our stateroom attendant was kind and respectful but most importantly he kept our room ready for us no matter the time of day.  Darwin represented Celebrity well.  
We sail again in June to Alaska, our second cruise there with Celebrity and bringing friends for their first EVER cruise!
We are hooked on you….. | After an app update, I can’t log in anymore. | The app only wants to give me a calendar of events. | It was a fun filled week. Lots is entertainment, music was excellent, and excursions were superb! | It says requires iOS 17 but my older phone can’t get that version!  App is slow in loading. My long password worked few days ago and today it didn’t work. I had to make a new one and shorter because it wouldn’t accept longer one. | This is our fifth cruise & first on the Apex. Definitely, the BEST ship & crew to cruise with. We are having a blast! This may be our first, but hopefully it will not be our last. KUDOS to our captain and the crew of this amazing team ❤️ | App is slow, not intuitive, crashes a lot | Able to navigate site easily and quickly. With practice and use it becomes easy to navigate through cruise information questions. | Where do I take he health test?   Rebecca yost | The App is not user friendly, with no search option | Can’t change dinner reservations. Have to cancel and rebook. Not easy to find what I want | After the last update the App takes about 12 seconds to open???
I booked an excursion and said apply my onboard credit, it did not work. Charged my credit card the full amount. It does not show my cruise package inclusions, Wi-Fi, Drink Package etc. I am booked into the Retreat. I would have expected better. First time on Celebrity. Rather dissapointing | This cruise gave me total comfort and excitement with every event attended. I feel I can even go by my self… | Trying to do health questions which have to be done on the app but there is no place to access them | My favorite ship, however I have tried numerous times since check in and even have called and still not able to make dinning reservations. Sick of all the email ads and discounts offered and being told all is full. It was suggested that I stand in line when I get on board to make reservations, told my husband he can do Im done trying, no food is worth time I’ve invested. This is to be a vacation not an experience in wait and schedule. All this scheduling for all things have soured my family from cruising, cruisers for 40 yrs😢 | How ridiculous that for a $15,000 to $20,000 Cruise Price Tag, the Celebrity App does not have feature to like or save an excursion so I can discuss with my spouse !!! We insider that the most basic and fundamental feature of this type of App. Even the “discount” Cruise App have that feature - Celebrity please correct and at least look like your care about your customer’s experience !!! | Love the app.  Easy to use and everything I want to know and explore is there (except my upgraded drink package)! | Too few pools, no accommodations for children, not even a water slide
If your teen doesn’t like the teen club, there’s nothing else for them to do | The 2nd(?) person who checked us in had a bad attitude.  She wasn't friendly (verbally, or w/body language), was borderline rude, & appeared to absolutely HATE her job. | It’s Super hard to find out what the ship has to offer! We want to have entertainment like Broadway-esque shows and comedians, or dancing to live bands on board! As of now- I’m just being sold ship tours or cooking lessons on board.  I hope I didn’t make the Wrong Choice!
Cruising is supposed to be fun on and off ship. | No puedo ver mi habitación para el viaje 
Quiero verla
Ubicación interior balcón | The app is helping me get ready for our cruising adventure. Packing with the schedule on the app, very helpful.  I checked out the menu for restaurants, looks great.  
Sea ya! | I really happy after this trip at the APEX
I want to congratulate all the crew for their professional kindness, their smile, and helpful.

Very special mention to Wallace the Brazilian solo guitar at The Eden, his is amazing and lovely. The waitress Jerónimo at the bar, special lovely person.

I have no enough words to thank Andy and Made at the Cosmopolitan restaurant, night by night both surprise us with their perfect service, they make tissue flowers for us, the napkins were present in different and gracious shapes. Under Daniel supervision this restaurant is unique with exquisite food too. 

Special mention about Melvin who helped me with the medical service when another pax felt over me. His emotional support were really important during the process. Days after Daniel and him continues asking me about my health.

Sincerely,

Luz Astrid Canete
Stateroom 11172 | So far the sign in and preliminary things have been pretty easy. Waiting to see how things go on arrival at port. | It is complicated to find the areas that you want to review. A lot of information that would be helpful. It cannot be accessed on the app. | Needs to flow more easily. Cannot find certain amenities or dining options offered. D not understand all the “upgrades”. Why? | Hard to navigate and not always have a good view of my itinerary. | Frequently crashes | My celebrity app stopped working after we rebooked our cruise for a better price.

Had previously used SiriusTravelLink but that wasn’t compatible with this model of Toyota.  Really like this and it makes planning a road trip easy whether short distance or long.  It shows you what will be happening along the way.  Easy to use on my iPhone and with CarPlay in the car dashboard display. | My son was driving from Chattanooga to Houston, and I was concerned about the weather along the way as to when to start the trip. I was AMAZED to find the On the Way app and so pleased to see how well it performed. Tell your friends! | This app has the potential to be revolutionary when it comes to travel and weather. I haven’t been able to get the precipitation to work on a consistent basis and currently I have no adverse weather conditions in the area. I have a Apple CarPlay unit on my motorcycle and in my truck and it does work with them. I do need to spend some more time with it and try to get a handle on setting custom routes rather than allowing it to choose a route for me. I will give it some more time now that the weather is showing and maybe they will allow me to update my review. This really does have the potential to be a favorite for travel | I am  very disappointed because I signed up for Lifetime
Membership and I was not able to share it with family and I was not able to download in my other devices.
I emailed ON THE WAY customer service, NO REPLY. | This app is actually really nice if you’re traveling across states that are bipolar like western ones (Idaho and Utah😂). I just use the free version and it’s nice enough. I’m not sure if the pro version is worth it unless you consistently travel | Very disappointed to be in a down pour and it does not show it on the map! Needs better reliability! | Love this app. If you are driving somewhere it is a must have. | On my 550 mile drive today the app shut itself down three times before I just force closed it.  Completely unreliable. | Awesome tool for trucking. I use it often. | The app does NOT give you a warning when the free trial period is about to expire!! Do not rely on this promise, as you will be charged $24.99 with no warning 😡 | I downloaded an can’t get my money back. It only gives you weather when you have a destination in. Why can’t we just see the weather all over the US ???? Stupid | Works great for wind, weather and mapping. Glad to have it along for the ride | Wish I had been the one to develop this app. One of the best travel apps I have, if not the best. | Glad to see this kind of weather app be part of the CarPlay family, however the pricing may become problematic. It would only take an existing navigation map, such as Google or Apple Map to add a weather forecast layer on a future release, and good by app. UPDATE 3/15/2024: Apparently, there is no longer a free version. Nice knowing you ✌🏾 | I’m impressed about the accuracy of the app. Very useful! | Scummy move. Uninstalled immediately. | Disappointed can’t look at more without paying the premium. Has potential. | They got rid of carplay and make you pay for it now. Luckily MyRadar just added carplay support and thwy are a better app anyway.... Bye weather on the go, you shot yourself inbthe foot. | We drive quite a bit between Seattle, Las Vegas, LA and San Francisco. This app really does help us w choosing routes based on conditions | My daughter and I have to drive through the mountains to see each other (Sacramento to Portland). She got stuck in a hotel because of snow on her last trip. I downloaded this app when going to visit her to make sure I could make it all the way both directions. It was 100% correct the entire way. I also like seeing what the weather is going to be like at the end of my drive without having to look up multiple cities on the weather app. | We got this app to help us navigate the weather recently but it has been woefully inaccurate. It repeatedly showed the temps to be well above freezing and only “wet” roads when trip check clearly showed snow covered roads and below freezing temps. | I find this travel app far better at giving me the core information I need regarding weather along routes. I drive often through the Pacific Northwest during winter time and I find this far better at giving me road closures and inclement weather between where I am and where I’m going than Google maps, Apple Maps or Waze | This app works great. | Unless I’m doing something wrong, this the only navigation app ever created without auto correct. 
When you decide to vary from the recommended route this app sticks with it’s original recommendation, making no effort to adjust to your desired path. 
Makes no sense! | What a stupid app. Cancelled after a day. Provides no better information than using other FREE weather apps. Will be interesting to see if the cancellation went thru since I still see a message that it will renew. | Flying is awful these days, so I'm doing more long road trips.  It's *super* helpful for traveling in the winter months to find days when there won't be snow.  For other months, being able to pick dry pavement days is awesome.  

You can adjust the departure time, and it updates weather conditions at multiple points along the trip route as you change the departure time.  Great app! | This app is great! I was luck enough to find it and it saved me from driving in 7 hours of rain. I changed my departure date to avoid driving in rain. | The app work fine on my iPhone but in CarPlay, I do not get automatic refresh’s. It’s like it froze on the first picture after logging into CarPlay. Any help fixing this issue. Thank you for your help. | This app insists on showing a route from Kingman ax to Albuquerque detouring through Phoenix when I 40 is the straight path. Even when I go granular it doubles back through Phoenix | I downloaded this app for a trip I was about to take half way across the country. I was just going to use the free trial version but was so impressed I paid for it. I have used it several time since and have never been let down. I can utilize the best times to leave and avoid potential dangers by adjusting my departures if needed. | Absolutely not worth it. Many free apps do the same | Why this app has so much subscriptions that it costs $85 for a life time subscription? | Great app!! Would rove the ability to buy a monthly subscription. | I’ve depended on this app & it was working great for me until this week. It won’t let me choose a different route. Without the ability to choose a route this app is pretty useless to me. | Kill 2 birds with 1 stone.  Route and weather.  Sweet. | Traveling with our RV to get to the sun from and through the snow requires we are hyper vigilant on knowing road conditions. We don’t have a moment of stress because this app keeps us in the know! | I think this is a great app, I like all the features it offers  except for one thing it lacks but not sure if it’s due to me using the free version at the moment.
This one issue will keep me from buying the pro version unless this can be corrected. 
 The one thing I don’t like is that if you go off route it will not automatically recalculate a new route from your current travel path. It will display and ask that you return to route. 
   The app does offer multiple routes but it would be safer for a driver to not have to pull over and not try to manually choose an alternate while driving.
   Lacking this feature is the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars. | I got the app to plan ahead on weather. It was great when I needed to use it. I only use it occasionally. But now they charge you? That’s dumb. The whole reason I got this was that feature was free. Definitely deleting it now | Plenty of apps are focused on navigation. I wanted 3 things: navigation, weather on route and CarPlay. The weather was very inaccurate at the time when it was needed most. Hours of driving when snowing in New England when app said it was cloudy, no snow. Then it said needed Pro for Car Play.  Delete. | I asked and the developer answered! I am sure I am not the only one, but my main issue was running into severe fog on my regular route. I am so happy to see this has been added. Thanks! | At first i liked the app but after a week it made me pay for it 👎🏽 BOOO 0/10 | Great app but suddenly they now charge an insane ~$25/month fee to change departure time. I’d rather check the weather at every location myself | I’ve been loving this app. Have used it for 2 months for work. I travel often for work. It’s been great until yesterday. I checked my route many times and it had all clear. No spots of wet or ice. However my husband called before I left and warned me of ice on many parts if my journey. So I checked ODOT trip check and no doubt there is at least a 45 minute stretch of black ice and ice. Quite a few deadly car crashes and more. While this app is great for many reasons, always double check roads. | This app is reliable. It works at all times. I have never seen the system down. It’s dependable and accurate. | Does not allow adding more travel time to your route :-( | This app WAS great; however, no you have to pay a subscription fee of $24.99 in order to check the weather for any day past today. | This app is inconsistent about showing possible routes. I even saved a southerly route and it still wouldn’t show it to me. Not purchasing after my free trial. | Perfect app to help me feel safer when my daughter travels to and from college in another state.  Before I found this app, I would literally try to figure this out on my own. It could be an exhausting endeavor, but worth it for her safety and my peace of mind.  Now I can just click and drag to get a plan in seconds!   Just genius. | Have been using this for a few months. It has been great. I like being able to share the timeline. And, the “Leaving when” feature is nice.

I do wish I could choose to use Google Maps… | Tried the free week. We are traveling I-40 in January. The app said it was all clear. The weather channel said there was a winter storm advisory. Thank goodness we looked at the weather and didn’t use this app. We would have been stuck!",4.7489,11350,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6b/3b/92/6b3b92c9-65b9-3d25-369e-ca61689bc812/808e6ca1-4819-43af-ac14-791117fa7c4d_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4a/9c/bf/4a9cbfc0-2417-39a1-023f-65420c885a43/046845d0-1aa4-4068-9b2b-af3d2be2de61_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1f/fe/a0/1ffea020-f1cb-6879-2507-df83bd28b79a/67716423-30ba-4f05-a936-085c95d1e180_2_small.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ee/76/88/ee7688e9-94bb-b2c1-39a5-198c0c4228d4/dd710f28-d4e3-42b6-9192-08a98f48e42c_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/34/c7/01/34c7019d-7a8e-a86e-9c34-2c2e5ebccae7/a9885f79-8525-498a-bc7b-cb356ad0588e_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/82/24/d8/8224d8fe-6830-4296-1726-c06315b03758/1b5f2626-8222-424c-94cb-39a39b5bfe2b_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8e/9b/06/8e9b06c4-567d-3880-4c55-d39fa519e03a/88e5a55c-52d3-4597-964d-5765b5b07633_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/73/4b/56/734b562e-2ed5-9fb0-ec6d-9bafd3de02d3/73a3af20-5e27-49ae-89b1-6b7cd618d751_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1f/00/ba/1f00bac9-9170-b950-2492-58afd28d57c8/8e002edd-0a2b-4722-bab7-60666794f232_7.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6c/24/61/6c24615f-f831-399b-e1f3-a3a814b9933e/6f11a14f-64df-4bfb-b069-84a46a6697b0_appStore_ipad1.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/a9/0b/a1/a90ba121-0e60-e3df-2a3d-c1caa0947132/3f8e57b8-a4ba-428c-90f4-f5017bd9e852_2.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/38/93/24/389324d3-9c62-0c31-bf64-d30de19ea93b/5663ac15-0fe0-4f9a-9fd5-d5459509684a_appStore_ipad3.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8f/62/7d/8f627da5-a704-8c59-4779-ff479af843dd/f52a4fe9-7561-4b2c-a298-d3f3b692e444_appStore_ipad4.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/b2/d4/8f/b2d48f75-e94f-b053-af00-a275733e7242/9b50ec38-6920-47df-b149-ca8f060af538_appStore_ipad5.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11Fourt

The map does not have much data. I downloaded the maps for the cities I am visiting, but most restaurants are not on the map. When I use it to navigate off line, it draws a straight line from point A to point B as if I’m a bird flying instead of walking on the streets. I don’t get it. | I bought Sygic Travel and paid the additional $29.99 to get Premium.  I am unable to mark 2 locations in Edinburgh so that I can see clearly how to get from my hotel to the location where a tour I am taking originated.  So I logged into my account online and all that comes up on the screen is a page called “Account overview” .  It tells me that I have no active subscriptions even though I purchased Sygic Travel Premium.  There is a help page on the website which tells me that with Sygic Travel Premium, using the mobile app on my phone I can unlock full place details, get walking directions and access itineraries, maps and guides offline.

I have none of that functionality with the mobile app.  They have online chat so I explained my problem and received a reply in chat that I would receive a response in five business days.  Appalling service.  This is a bait-and-switch app and I will never recommend this app to anyone who | I’m not going to write a long review or list pros and cons, just some things I don’t like about the app. 1) Route planning is god awful with no convenient ways to alter them. The route it chose for me to a particular destination was nearly 11 hours vs the 7 hours Sygic and Google routed. You do get transferred to the actual Sygic navigation app for GPS navigation but again that is inconvenient. 2) Even if it was just a summary I’d like to see my whole trips itinerary instead of just being able to see a single day. 3) I was going to send this note as feedback to them but their feedback email doesn’t allow you to actually SEND the email. 4) Finally, there have been no updates for over a year, which implies they don’t really care too much about it.  Maybe I don’t understand the app well enough but it’s looking like it was a waste of money. | This app is wonderful. One question. I know Sygic gps navigation does not require Wi-Fi of cellular. Could that be incorporated into Sygic Travel? | In 2016 we were traveling through California’s vast Anza Borrego dessert and lost cell signals. Scary! We found our way out and I looked for an app that would serve as an offline GPS, rather than adding a cumbersome Garmin device. After installing Sygic I literally could navigate anywhere without the need for a cell signal (other than initially downloading maps). 
     That was the start of my appreciation of the extraordinary value and features of Sygic! It continues to get better with more features  since 2016. We travel about half the year throughout the country in our Class B RV (Ford Transit camper van). Apple Car Play supports both Apple and Google maps, but Sygic through Car Play is our go-to navigation.  We depend on it and the features other navigation does not offer that are too extensive to list here. | Great app. Wonderful for creating day-by-day sightseeing itineraries, which is exactly what I was looking for. But 1 star deduction because it claims to support Family Sharing and yet doesn’t even show up I’m my subscriptions list, which makes it impossible to share. | When one doesn’t understand what it takes to develop an app, you get reviews like the ones who complain about its costs and features for premium version. I did not hesitate one second getting the premium version of this app, it has all-in-one what other apps offer separately or lack functionality. You get trip planning suggestions, tour suggestions and their cost, navigation help and instructions, all the information you need to plan your trip and a lot more! Honestly, this app is a gem and the developers really outdid the features and actually carefully selected what one user NEEDS and can get lots of advantage for. I cannot stress enough how awesome of an app this is. I just downloaded and needed to share my thoughts because I barely buy apps and let alone leave reviews but this one deserves every good review it gets. I applaud for the effort and thoughtfulness of making this app the most convenient one for trip planning I have seen in the app store. Thank you and I really hope you continue making it as awesome as it is and seamless to navigate. Two suggestions as an iPad user would be a calendar view to visualize trips in a calendar format (or calendar integration, which I am still exploring in the app) and an apple pencil/ draw format for note taking as it is easier for me to use but those two suggestions are just that, the app is awesome as is and has a lot of room for growth. | If you are not a premium user you are done this app will not provide any information for free. | I just downloaded the app and planned for my trips, the app is amazing (free version) however, for me as a traveller, I would like to know the admissions/fee of the attractions. Along with budgeted amount.

I would recommend to add this feature (even if for paid version) and it will be great app ever. | This had a few tourist sites listed.  Other than that, I find Gaia more useful:  Lots of map choices.  Tracks my location.  Routes easy to set up | I travel alot and this app paired with the sygic world maps premium package are great. Even if you have zero internet connection you have offline access. I used in at the Grand Canyon on a motorcycle ride and came in handy was not able to get my maps to work on google and sygic came thru gave me gas stations on the route etc and made it back in total darkness without any interruptions 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 | Wasted half a day fighting with this app trying to input a specific scenic day trip route.  Good for point a to point b routing but nothing more.  Waste of time and money imho. | I just paid for premium and it’s still trying to up-sell me.
No user info in login.
Definitely not intuitive!
Not having a good time! | This was so smart and easy and worked all through our trip - kept everything in order and got us everywhere in London & Paris! | We’ve been using Sygic travel app for a few years.  We are the do-it-all-by-ourselves crazy type who always try to squeeze as much as we can in the short time we managed to take off.  This app makes planning an itin so much easier.  We usually start off with reading various attractions both in app and online.  After we identify where we want to go, select what we want to do in each day and the app map out a logical route and give us an estimate of how long the itin will take.  Planning to go to the 50th country next. | I downloaded this and tried to set up a trip. I failed completely. Not intuitive at all. | I’ve tried a few and this one is by far the best. I love how it lets me schedule my day with walking distance (or car/train etc) being able to estimate my entire day. It also gives me the map on how to get there etc. I’ve used it in Italy, Greece, Turkey and now I just got done planning my France trip. I love it! | Keeps crashing, too few sort filters, way to slow, needs a complete overhaul ! | Been a premium user since 2016.  Been happy on most part.  Would like integration with CityMapper for public transportation routing so that I don’t need to exit this app and then to type in location in CityMapper.  The Visitacity free map already can do that. | I have been enjoying this App since the year 2015 or before.  I use it on my international trips, has never let me down. Thank you for this great app. | If you buy this you will only get support if you have the original receipt. Save that receipt, or don’t expect to ever have an issue. | I attempted to make a route using my iPhone, which was difficult. After reviewing, I see that you develop a route online, then save it (favorite) and it’s supposed to show in your App.   I do see the route on my iPad, but not my iPhone.  And, when I try to ‘share’ from my iPad, it shuts down/closes the App.   What gives????? | After the last update the app is not working I have perches some of options but it’s look like I’m losing money with your app after the update | It is a good basic app but to make it perfect developers need to:
- add lots of missed attractions.
- make country Templates “Road Trip”.
- make a list of top attractions as you zoom out. | من افضل برامج تلتنقل | Please Add Persian Support Language Like Official Sygic | Hi I am trying to make an app with the same concept but I’m going to focus on a small island only. How hard was it choosing between developers and may I ask how much it costed?
Thanks | This app is absolutely worthless!  To build an itinerary is painful. You first need to build it on a piece of paper because there is no editing. Even if you input the time for each site the app will not move the items in the correct order. You can not choose the mode of transportation between places. The app picks one for you. Basically zero flexibility with this thing. Very disappointed, now I’m sure it will be a pain to cancel the monthly subscription. | Everything has been working just fine and unjust wish there was a way of ticking or clicking done on the things I’ve already fulfilled on my list. | A waste of time, it's free to download and nothing else, I can't even try it because I have to pay. Deleted. | Trips from my group will not appear in my app. Only on the computer version which defeats the purpose. | Doesn’t allow you to create your own itineraries. | Great app especially putting a trip together on a computer but a total disappointment when coming to the app on an iPhone XS Max. Even when I’m in hotspots takes forever to go from one screen to the other and majority of the time it kicks me straight out. Doing a lot of travel to Europe the first couple times I used this app was slow but ok but my last trip to Cologne it was non functional period. | Nothing on this app works. I paid 4.99 for everything and I can’t even make an account. Can’t save anything. Everything I click just pops up with an error code. Terrible app I’d like a refund. | The search is terrible and you can’t find anything. When you try to search by street names it re directs you to a entirely different search. | It’s good improvement. 
thanks | Who is giving this thing good reviews??? It just freezes up. Totally unusable. But they got their $4 out of me and thats all that matters. | You have to pay to see anything | I was hoping it will work but it is complex and not worth the money.  I consider myself a tech savvy but got lost in the complexity.  Wish I could get the money back. | What good are the offline maps if the software is going to insist on attempting to provide a preview of the route using online data when sufficient data connection is not available. | This makes it so easy to find places to see, it lets you pick bubbles on the map and dig into reviews and other valuable information right there. Then adding an item to your itinerary is simple and you can start managing the days on the trip so you aren't doing too much or too little. | I used to plan to my trips using trip advisor, however they took away the ability to schedule items within each day of the trip. I tried using Google Trips, Tripline, and any other app that was recommended for trip planning. Sygic is the only one I have tried which had all the options I needed. Some of the features I appreciate include: being able to select multiple types of transportation for each day. If I am trying to plan a route on google maps for a day it won’t let me switch between using a car and using public transportation. Sygic let’s me decide for each destination whether I want to drive, take public, transportation, etc. The app also estimates based on the activities and routes how long of a day it will be. I used to manually estimate how long I would spend at each place I wanted to visit based on googles average for how long people spend there. Sygic automatically has an estimate for each travel site already. Also those times can be adjusted if needed. 
The premium feature of printing trips to PDF is also great. The PDF looks great and includes the travel guides for the cities you are visiting. 
Overall the app has everything I want from a trip planning app and I looking forward to continuing to use it for many more trips to come! | Wow off to Japan, and Asia. Out of all the app’s this one is way better the all others and I purchased five looking for something like this one. Thank you | Just started using this app and I like how easy it is to plan your itinerary out. Even share it. The biggest problem I have is being able to use my choice of navigation. I’d like to be able to use Google Maps or Apple maps for directions but it forces you to use their GPS solution, which then requires an additional purchase to get turn by turn directions!

Update: User error. Sygic actually uses Apple’s way of doing their settings so it wasn’t apparent to the user. Support is correct and you can change the default navigation app. Home Screen/Springboard > Settings > Sygic Travel. Amazing. The only issue I have is the app should walk you through an initial setup to get these things sorted out. With this fixed definitely an app I could recommend to others. Transferring my itinerary back to this now. Thank you! | Move an item from one day to the next, deletes any notes you had on that item. Pretty frustrating, for what would appear to be a rather simple programming task. | حسين من الكويت من عشاق السفر
شكسبير الكويت | I have been using this product in the last couple of weeks it has great features that you don't see them in other GPS applications. | مركز سعدون لصيانه الايفون | Loved Sygic for planning trips. Newest version lost all the tools and views I relied upon to plan my trips. How can I get the old version if the app back? Find the new version impossible to plan, arrange and time my day. | Be VERY careful. If you install you will be charged $25 to your Apple account without your approval.  Apple should take this down!

Apple directs me to YOU!  Fix it.  To all others, when you download it will default to a $25 premium per year subscription. If you press any key you will be subscribed and your money gone.

It was great having everything (and everyone) on the same page. The app is very intuitive and user friendly. Would highly recommend. | The application provides a very practical benefit by allowing people to coordinate travel plans with ease in real time. I would definitely consider using this for multi-party travel arrangements in the future. | This app is so cool. It’s really helpful for me, and to efficiently manage my trip a lot easier. Even with a short trip I run to this app. I’ve tried like 8 other apps and this one is by far the best. | Using slap kept our plans and people together during trip all the time!!

One of the standout features for me was the photo sharing. It allows you to share high quality photos without having to crop them, which was great for capturing our beautiful vacation.

Another useful feature was the location sharing. It was great to use between my wife and I to ensure we were never lost in a foreign country.

Overall, I highly recommend the Slap app for anyone planning a trip. Its unique features make it a must-have for any traveler. | My daughter recently did a Europe trip with ultimate break group. She sent me a private invite on slap for the whole trip. I was able to see her trip photos, itinerary and her location which helped my anxiety. Now we use it on a more regular basis to keep posted of each other whereabouts. | I have tried a few trip planning apps, which made inviting friends and planning events overwhelming and confusing. This app has been very useful planning my bffs bachelorette party. We were able to plan our itinerary, coordinate our stays, and share tickets without much hassle. Location feature helped keep our group together and let people know what everyone was up to. The app is a bit simplistic but very useful and cute. Other than a few hiccups, I was pleasantly surprised by this app! Would definitely recommend!",5,13,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/48/3f/96/483f9638-ef2b-b81e-8254-8b8af982f21f/0ef262a7-899d-4e53-b23e-d3e9a172548a_s1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4c/72/15/4c7215fa-38f6-23fb-20dd-52f1bf8a1a9a/95943af2-4ac9-41ce-8533-3b5d829acae8_s2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/99/a8/1d/99a81de0-a8a4-e27d-926d-e3ea860ec033/bb42da20-38e6-4be5-9e2e-e00f0a1755e1_s3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c4/60/e4/c460e4f5-386e-7435-026a-0c5b1fef3086/afa9561d-9d0a-48c2-a906-e4686aacc6ab_s4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/1e/d1/d1/1ed1d174-f926-a638-d4b8-0c35cf9107f7/55455c49-8f2f-4767-8cb8-0b6572b5a856_s5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/82/58/bc/8258bc8a-e32b-60ed-625d-e6857613c3f9/b2c04195-d523-4931-8339-2069ceebb093_s6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/24/61/4c/24614c83-14f9-d81e-e473-c77fa35bb56b/73b2a6b8-dad2-4755-b5e6-9b5f41f85da9_s7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2b/1b/4f/2b1b4f87-e7af-75f6-dd74-dedaf9f09da9/96e284b1-6a37-4269-958f-a11a97e2e799_s8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/19/85/40/19854066-eb8e-8b0e-8759-ec349b5c79ac/8a037a65-7e78-43fd-aa5c-dde1e18166c3_s9.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Not completely inconvenient, but just takes some getting used to. Worth it for the money saved though! | We loved it so far 
We are saving money and have no problems to used it | This is an awesome way to see the city. With this pass you hit almost every main attraction. Totally worth the price. I’ve used city pass on 3 separate vacations. LOVE IT - great value. | The CityPASS app is very helpful and you get tickets at discount prices. I would highly recommend getting your tickets through this app it’s cheaper and explain in details what all you need before visiting your destinations. 5/5 keep it up CityPASS. | This is an excellent way to move about the city with tickets for major attractions , time saving and cost effective. | City Pass was very convenient and easy to use. It was so nice to have all admissions to venues in one place. | It’s very convenient to use City Pass. Very very excellent and I’m enjoy it | Developer takes reviews into account and tries to implement updates to improve the experience. Previously I had rated this a one and left feedback. They fixed everything that I had issues with. | Just keeps making me verify email | My new tickets don’t appear in My Purchase. | Like others, I am stuck in the endless loop of going into the app, “verifying” my email, going to email to verify, then being directed to Safari instead of app. So the actually app is literally unusable for me. I like the whole system with being able to get discounts on tickets, I just wish I didn’t have to use a browser to access those tickets when an app is supposedly available. I will be deleting the app now. | Like other mentioned, the app won’t connect to the ticket bought. Why they put out this garbage to waste people’s time? Apple should ban this app. | I cannot even access my account in the app to add my tickets! I resent the link to connect my email 8 times and uninstalled the app 3 times. And I still cannot access my tickets on the app. A complete waste of time. | The app will not link to my email. I have about 20 “verification emails” and click the link but it routes you directly to safari, with no way to open the app. Seems like this is very common feedback and gas yet yo be resolved. I even tried deleting the app and still had no luck. | Horrible app. Waste of time to book reservations. It will never happen in a mobile app | The shed aquarium and sky deck are not worth it at all.
Save your money, get a boat ride and Amy museum you like. | Purchasing the ticket is simple. 

Linking the ticket does not work in the app. The verification email includes a website that works if you open it in a browser. However, a link stating “open in app” and the ability to make a reservation in the app would be user friendly.

I | What a scam! Did not receive the 5 passes I ordered. Tried to contact customer service… what a joke! Could not speak to anyone. I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau after I contact my credit card. | Too hard to get your money’s worth out of it. Better to just buy your tickets separately. If you don’t use all it’s more expensive than just buying when you go on the museum website. I miss counted the days and missed out on two entrance fees | I like how the pricing works and that you can reserve straight from the website or you can reserve using city pass. But what I don’t like is linking my ticket every time I want to make a new reservation I have to delete the app to re-link my tickets properly, which is very annoying | The single worst email verification system I have ever seen. Sinful, abominable, atrocious. You should all be ashamed. | I bought Chicago city passes on their website. After checking out, I learned they have an app to manage the city passes. When I got the app and went through the link passes flow, I ended up in the mobile Safari app instead of their app. Looks like their app isn’t setup correctly to handle universal links. It’s a shame that I can’t use their app’s flagship feature | The app is good for what it does, the CityPASS program is very helpful for my solo travel plans to some of the cities listed. Although some items are packaged weirdly, I make due with what I got. | I have used citypass in NYC before the app and now again with it. I like the ability to reserve the entry times in advance for my people. No fuss or surprises.

TIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES
• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.
• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.
• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.
• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).
• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.

Some routes sync, most don’t 🤷🏾‍♂️ | Great for getting back | I Like Drawing Lines | I never write reviews. But this is literally the single best app of any sort that I have ever used. I use CityStrides to walk every street in my city, and the Apple Watch Footpath app is absolutely perfect for helping guide me through a lot of unfamiliar streets without ever using my phone. Other apps were prompting me multiple times per street, but Footpath has perfect turn by turn navigation and shows you the next 3 upcoming turns. There’s live breadcrumbs on the map, so I can see which streets I’ve already covered. There’s great Action Button integration, so I can start Footpath with one click and then toggle between the live map and the turn by turn instructions with a click. And on top of it all, it makes managing my music or audiobooks easier too by including media player controls.

Great job Footpath team! | Incredibly handy app! | I purchased a subscription to this app because it was formerly considered the best hiking navigation for the Apple Watch Ultra. I imported GPX tracks from AllTrails, then used Footpath from my watch on the trail. Now hikes will no longer launch on my watch from Footpath, although I’m doing the same thing. I waited a month to see if they would fix it but they haven’t, so I cancelled my subscription, got one for AllTrails, and will be using their functional watch app for hiking navigation. It’s not as good as Footpath used to be on the watch, but it’s better than what it now offers - nothing. | Everything else that comes close in usability is behind a paywall | The only reason I didn’t give a 5 star, could be my own fault. Ending a run on my Apple Watch is always confusing. I’m never sure how to end it, and once I do, I’m not sure how I got there. 

Having said that, I love this app. I love creating my routes, I love the colors that show me the hard hills, I love being able to transfer my route to my watch, I love that most of the time the turn-by-turn instructions come through my Shokz (occasionally if my STRAVA- which never comes through my Shokz- announces my mileage in close time to a turn, footpath will announce through my watch, but then reset and come back through my Shokz). I’ll be going on vacation and I’m using footpath to plan my runs in another state. Soooo worth it! Thank you! | Nice app to plan running or biking routes ahead of time. Provides elevation stats to plan perfectly. | App isn’t consistent writing to Apple health. I like logging outdoor runs and walks with the app and love the outline of the route that shows on my watch at the end of a workout but I’m always afraid that my workout won’t save in health. I shouldn’t have to buy elite to export it later. | This app is very good at what it is intended to do (or at least what I intend to use it for). I just wish it had better integration with third party apps such as Strava.
 I mapped out a backcountry XC ski route in an area without signal and service with the intention of using offline maps and cue. It was very easy and intuitive to draw the route in my iPhone. transferring to my Apple Watch Ultra 2 for the offline map and cues was a breeze. It worked very accurately starting in an area miles away from cell service. I was able to run Strava in the background with a couple of swiping press of the buttons. 
This third party app takes advantage of what Apple has set up for developers to use to make the Ultra 2 compete with Garmin Epic and Fénix. | Extremely hard to edit a track, it would be nice to edit this on a windows desktop, I’m working on an iPad and it really makes life difficult. | So I haven’t used it a ton yet, but it looks promising and here’s why:

1- use what ever mode you want - boat, walking bike and car- perhaps more🙃
2- it finds a route by drawing it or selecting a end point - and/or a start point!

What I haven’t quite used or figured out:
- navigation part - the “go” button
- how well the path for hiking works
- if it is the best route for driving/walking/biking. By best I mean the one that would make sense and be best for what ever mode you choose.

Anyway, it will be interesting to test it out.

Finally, I would add, If it does most of what it offers, then the price point makes it a good value! | Your satélite maps needs updating as they are 6 months behind most maps on Google maps. You software is also quite temperamental around sidewalks and beaches. I want to like it but you refuse to fix it. | After transitioning to booting on my ski trip yesterday, the action button would no longer display the map on my watch. Either the Footpath app crashed or it auto paused (perhaps since booting up a 45 degree plus slope would appear as no movement?). After a few desperate attempts to get mapping working I realized that somehow Footpath got paused, but even after unpausing I couldn't get the action button to bring up maps.

Luckily my ski partners Garmin Fenix guided us correctly between perilous cliff bands on our descent. Unfortunately, these Apple watch ""Ultras"" don't seem to live up to their name. I have lost trust in these devices being able to safely guide me in the backcountry. Luckily I wasn't on a remote peak, only 4 or so miles from our car, and my partner's watch saved us from accident turning down onto a cliff. | Easy to use, great support, always looking for new useful features! Love the elevation details! | Kinda bummed to write this review but the app has frozen on me a few times while out in the forest. I’ve really enjoyed having the map on my watch, it’s super convenient. From what I’ve noticed if you don’t download the offline maps, the watch will freeze. It usually freezes when it prompts you when you clock in another mile w/ the last mile pace. The good thing is that it continues to record in the background. I’ve been able to pause and start with the side buttons just know that one beep means you paused it and Teo beeps is to start it back up. Once the trip is over, I will pause it and TURN OFF/ON my watch and you are able to save the trek and send it back to your phone. REALLY ANNOYING…I’m looking for a watch I can use during trail races but this one is too faulty to compete with. Maybe it’s my watch (series 7)… I gave it 3 starts because everything else works amazing. Maybe one day you will be able to upload it immediately to strava or any other running app instead of downloading the completed GPX file to your computer and then uploading to an other app. Otherwise 3/5 stars and that’s because it’s Christmas Eve and I’m feeling a little too nice. | This app is exactly what I’ve been looking for!!! to be able to set up whatever run I want and to know how long they are before I try them. | This app is phenomenal and has helped me with confirming and being able to post my true mileage that I’m running instead of my estimate! Good job on the app | I am looking for an app to use for hiking. Most important to me is the ability to create a route, and to follow that route.

I love having the ability to define a route with my fingertip. However, the app is clearly better suited for on-road than off-road use. The search function can locate streets but not hiking trails. You can have a map called up that displays the name of the trail on it. Search for that trail name, and the app cannot find it! 

I sent an email 2 weeks ago to the app support, I explained the problem, and asked if I was doing something wrong. I explained I assessing the free version of the app to see if I should become a subscriber. I never received a response to this simple question.

It begs the question, if the developer is unwilling to answer a question posed by someone considering becoming a paying customer, what will service be like once they have my money?

I note in the Apple apps Ratings and Review section, there are lots of comments but very few developer responses. Again, this raises questions about the level of support one can expect once your money has left your pocket.

Given my experience so far, although I like the app, the risk seems too great to commit to a subscription. | Just figured out how to import maps from Caltope so I can preview routes that are upcoming trail races that a race director has created and posted. And am learning how to use the turn prompts in the race. Seems to be a certain order of which app to start first, and trees and ravines throw the gps off a bit; but overall a great app. Have been using it for several years and love to have old routes and races stored. Now it’s easy to separate them into categories too. The various maps are great! | What a great app. It works for biking, running – even driving! I couldn’t be happier. | Use it for runs or planning any trips on foot. Can snap to the map for quick routing or unsnap on the rare occasion that’s needed. Don’t do much trails, but I often see plentiful trails on the map in places I didn’t even know had trails. | I have more than 8 map tools. 5 of them, including footpath are paid. Footpath app is best in snap to path feature.  Best satellite maps. 

Need more map overlays such as National Geographic Trail Maps etc. | This app is a treasure. It allows you to easily map routes, import GPX files, and gives turn by turn directions. The interface is clean and easy to use. It has good Apple Watch integration and a web interface. 

Just a few quibbles:

* It can sometimes get confused out and back or overlapping routes 
* Editing an existing course on iOS is difficult
* I can’t seem to figure out how to see the map on the Watch app
* If you get off course, it does not have an option to reroute. | I’ve been having too much fun drawing gravel bike routes to explore (and then riding them) .  The drawing function - on an iPad - is excellent, and the app is really well designed (good set of features) and well implemented (haven’t hit a bug yet).   It’s not so useful unless you subscribe to store maps, but the annual cost is entirely reasonable.  And they don’t ensure you into some social media/advertising scheme (which I hate)  as most apps do. prefect app for road, gravel, mountain bike route planning | The route planning portion of the by App is basically magical! My only real complaint is that pace alerts and heart rate alerts can't be set on the watch App, otherwise it's my go to App for hiking. | Location services is broken with Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Footpath. Location Services on the Ultra 2 during Footpath setup never turns green. Unable to use any GPS features of the app on the Ultra 2.

UPDATE: After uninstalling and reinstalling both phone and watch versions of the app I had to power off my phone to allow me to setup Location services in the app. Restarted the phone and everything works fine. | Footpath has very good plot tracing (although sometimes you have to plot tiny segments to get the points to stick where you want). Tons of different map sources. For MTB some of the “trails” on some sources are on private land and/or not well-worn, but I’d rather have more info than less. | I mapped out a run for 13.2 miles. I followed the path while using another app (MapMyRun) I have used on many 10k, half marathons, and marathons. The recorded distance (10.75 miles) ended up being 2.5 miles short of the mapped route on Footpath. 

I also compared my distance on my FitBit GPS. It matched MapMyRun and NOT Footpath.

I then did my best to map the distance on Google maps on a laptop. That distance again matched everything EXCEPT Footpath.

Lastly, I drove the route in my car (2023 vehicle) after i reset the miles tracker. It matched my FitBit and MapMyRun.

Please note, I downloaded the app on 9/15/23. I will have to assume I have the latest version.

I don’t have the latest phone, but I would assume since I am able to install the app, my phone version is fine.

iPhone 12 Pro
iOS 16.6.1 | This app is a blessing!! | I really want to love this app. A lot works great. It’s super easy to plan routes on your Mac or iPhone and to send them to your watch. The interface is intuitive. You can choose among different topographic maps. Seeing changes in elevation is also very useful.

Having said this, I’ve used this app for a few months now when going on short 3-6 day hikes in the wilderness and keep experiencing the following issues, which kind of make the app unusable in my opinion. These issues seem to get worse the longer your hike is. I’ll explain.

The longer you’ve been recording/using the app on a hike, the longer it takes the app to reload the current profile. For example, if you pause the hike on your second or third day after having hiked 40 or 50 miles, it sometimes takes more than 10 seconds to load and unpause the hike. The app doesn’t tell you that it’s doing something — at first I thought it wasn’t responding but it simply takes a long time for it to restart the navigation. It would be nice if the user interface gave the user some indication of the app loading. 

Sometimes it crashes, especially when you open the map and zoom out too fast. I’ve noticed that this happens at an annoying frequency when going on long hikes, especially after the third day or so. When this happens, you can restart the app and usually it will load the last hike automatically (although, again, this can take up to 10-15 seconds and if you don’t know that the app is doing this, you’re likely to just get impatient and restart the hike from the beginning). 

Another really frustrating feature is that the app automatically removes hike profiles after crashing sometimes, as well as when you end a hike. When that happens, you have to repair the watch with your phone to send the profile to the watch again. So, you basically have to take your phone on the hike with you, which is annoying as it’s pretty much useless in the wilderness and dead weight you’re lugging around. It would be nice if the watch could be used truly autonomously, but in my experience it can’t. Another major annoyance is that you can only send one profile to the watch at a time. Why can’t we store as many hike profiles on the watch as we want and choose when to manually delete them? 

Another annoying feature concerns the elevation profile (which is a nice feature as such). You can tap on a part of the profile and the app will zoom in on it. However, the app will only zoom in on either uphill or downhill sections. My main complaint here is that if you go on a long hike, the profile gets really compressed which means that when you use your finger to tap on a section, it’s basically a matter of luck whether the app will zoom in on the section that you want. You sometimes have to try 3 or 4 times to get the app to zoom in on the segment that you want. It would be nice if the user could freely zoom in and out of the elevation profile instead of the app guessing what the user wants to see. On short hikes this isn’t an issue, but on longer hikes the elevation maps becomes increasingly hard to use. It seems to me that the developers never tested this app in the field on hikes that are longer than 50 miles or so.

All in all, a nice app. But my bottom line is that the app can’t function autonomously on multi-day hikes and keeps crashing too frequently for me to keep using it. Of course, you shouldn’t truly rely on an app when in the wilderness. But if you want something you can depend on as a hiker, I would choose something like Garmin instead. At the moment, Footpath is not for serious hiking. I really hope the developers can fix some of these issues, as this could be a great app. | I’m traveling around South America and it’s an absolute pain to keep digging out my phone when I need left or right directions. Apple Maps isn’t supported here, and Google Maps just doesn’t want to work. Even if it did, Google Maps just gives a list of turn by turn directions. No map overlay. 

Footpath to the rescue. Sure, it’s a premium feature, but it’s legitimately the only thing I can find that just lets me send a route to my watch and make sure I’m not going off course. | Really hoped this app would work out to use a standard apple watch for running route planning and navigation, but my test run loop calculated by the app took me to a dead end. At this point, voice prompts completely stopped as well, requiring stopping the run to pull out the phone to try to debug things, which spoiled the workout. 

Either of those issues are dealbreakers on their own. Strava-like heatmaps would have helped identify the dead end issue during planning rather than the run, but no excuse for prompts to stop | I’m a runner and this is perfect for planning routes and super easy to use. The draw on map setting makes it really easy and works really well. | It’s cool and fun to create loops and tracks and the drawing feature works good buttt. The turn-by-turn GPS map view could use some optimization. It can be difficult and confusing in tight tuns like going through a city when on a bike zipping through things. It’s not smooth and there is a tracking latency. But everything else is cool | I have two other Map Apps (the big two). I could not plan my walking route adequately. As soon as I opened Footpath I was able to map my route and share flawlessly. This took seconds, the results were instant, and accurately reflected what route I walked and how far. | A little touchy. Sometimes depending you trace your routes, the app may think you are doing an out and back or a loop when you aren't. Also, I regrettably signed on for more features and was able to get navigation, but there is no voice or map overlay on the screen to show you a visual, so I was having backtrack quite a bit. I eventually gave up and did a google map. | This app is perfect for trail running.  I pre plan my routes on the phone and hit cue sheet export to send the directions right to my Apple Watch.   No more wrong turns ! | I tested this app on a holiday in the Cotswolds alongside another map/tracking software that used pdf topo maps I created from other route data sources and open source GIS desktop software (yes, I am a geospatial nerd). The convenience of the Apple Watch integration and the additional features, like elevation profiles, made this app my primary tool for planning and tracking our walks by the end of the holiday. 

I went ahead and subscribed to the annual plan because this app earned it, and I’ve been using it for hikes closer to home in the Sierra Nevada mountains more recently. The route data sources have been excellent and reliable, and this is a new favorite app for me. | The Apple Watch by itself is terrible because Apple software is very basic. Supposedly it’s going to improve with watchOS 17. We shall see? but with third-party apps it rivals any other outdoor watch on the market for tracking and mapping. Still doesn’t have the best battery compared to Garman, which I have used also. But good enough for me.  I’ve tried several third-party apps Gaia and all trails, and this app is easier and faster to use than any other app. | Super duper awesome, I plan all my big runs out before going with this banger app | very good！ | This app often routes a straight line from origin to destination where you’d have to be magic to actually walk through walls and buildings. Once it starts doing this you have to close out of the app and start over because it will continue to straight line every point you put on your route. (Snap to map is turned on). Also when the app is mostly working properly, it does route you down the middle of the roads rather than following sidewalks and crosswalks. The result is that it will assume you would cross busy and complex intersections like you were in a car instead of going to the nearest crosswalk. | I been using it for a year on oversized load route planning & it’s very useful. Thank you footpath team I tell everyone about it. 🙌🏻🤩 | I love using this app, easy to draw out cycling rides with distances, gives me an idea of where to go, mileage and time it will take me to complete the ride | Cool for planning a route and showing where you are on the route, but doesn’t track any stats from your trip or give guidance for the route without paying for a subscription. 🫤 | This app could easily cost 2 or 3 times as much and I'd gladly pay. I use it for every long run and it works flawlessly to highlight elevation and provide navigation. The support is excellent too. Thank you. | It seems like a great app but my gps would keep repeating everything twice as I used it and it wouldn’t track my location correctly.",4.7915,17530,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/b8/6b/5e/b86b5e03-ac93-39c4-616d-65745bf1e4f4/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/32/8a/5b/328a5b98-9c9d-ffe5-38fd-143184a6b379/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/24/5c/c2/245cc2a5-e912-bd6f-81e0-3583ad659c18/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/65/6e/22/656e226a-af83-ad0e-3c0e-feb3b6c28075/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1c/61/3c/1c613c76-acab-098c-a613-13c509690530/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/59/7d/a3/597da356-9594-c843-443e-d0123e81f20d/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/00/4e/82/004e82ad-8df4-d3ff-5b80-d77355f10960/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e8/4d/7e/e84d7e2c-fd61-e343-6041-6166760fbd3c/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/9d/48/d9/9d48d9e3-ade0-f2fa-634f-cd65d4b6872e/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/8b/e1/52/8be15252-a4c5-8f3c-12b6-06ed516a346d/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ca/32/15/ca3215ad-3ce2-4190-6862-d0cf54f7c670/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/f8/23/ab/f823abf8-6416-7f90-ac81-71c7d8c0f538/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ea/b4/34/eab434d8-6304-e388-eebd-fd8702a990ce/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/a4/f8/8d/a4f88d52-0457-c99e-7649-bd1cdea1e76d/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/0b/f6/ab/0bf6abf9-4643-7dce-373d-553ebd53d699/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Added coffee pot.  Coffee terrible. 
added a mini refrigerator. It was there with old food inside. disgusting. I didn't want to put anything in it. 
They threw a 30 yr old cough beside the bed that didn't have room to walk. 
Just a poor example of a room that has SUITE attached to it. 
View was good. 
I noticed the attitudes(not good)there were very different since Don Laughlin died. 
I’ve always enjoyed staying there but totally different this trip. | Clean, comfortable beds, minimal amenities, but adequate for one night stay | Clearly said on their website they would charge at the hotel, yet they charge our card ahead of time, and we had free cancellation! First time using hotels.com and definitely last time using hotels.com I’ll go back to using booking and airbnb ! | Constantly crashes, says “oops sorry there was an error”, and makes you go through pages of weird puzzles for authentication. Overall bad user experience | App is generally fine but messages stay unread even after they’re read. Super annoying! | This is my second time staying here on a work trip and just like the first time, I enjoyed my stay. Great bed, comfortable setting. Will definitely stay here again. | I had about a dozen free hotels saved up and they transferred to a different point system leaving me with $500 in points. So basically about 4 hotels.  We all got scammed. | We stayed for 2 nights. Excellent location. Pastries and port in the lobby in the afternoon. Very friendly, helpful staff. Room was nice. View of the river, but loud well into the evening because of the April 25 celebrations. Highly recommend. | The hotel was in a perfect location.  The hotel room isn’t too bad for the price.  I wouldn’t recommend room 111 the beds squeak enough to keep you awake. The same with the bathroom door also we only had luke  warm water in the shower. | I have several messages in the app regarding reservations or cancellations that are over a year old. The Badges show up on the app icon on my iPhone and although I've read them many times (the badges temporarily disappear), as soon as I move on to the next message the badge returns. PLEASE MAKE GHE BADGES GO AWAY or allow me to DELETE the OLD messages!! | I’ve had 3 notifications on my app for months and nobody seems to know how to get rid of them without deleting the app. | I am a Hiltons member, and have stayed at Embassy’s quite a bit, most was as usual, disappointed that we waited 1 1/2 hours AFTER check in to get a room, the TWolves were on , missed most of the game sitting in lobby, had a BB player who had played 3 games that day and really wanted a shower, so that was frustrating especially as I watched check in after check in going through, they were waiting for a premier room they said, which simply means free snacks, nothing else different it didn’t appear, they ended up bringing a sack of snacks to our room, the front desk personnel were kindthough ( to give a $20 food/beverage voucher while we waited, morning breakfast great!! | When I book a hotel thru Hotels.com. I am worry free.  I have trust. | Truly helped during so man tough situations. Such a truly amazing app thank you for this wonderful creation of being able to outstandingly satisfy my booking needs! | Close  enough to the main sights and the room and breakfast terrific. | I loved the older reward system, getting a free night average of every ten night you book on the app and being able to use it almost immediately on the 11th day. 

The new reward system is horrible compared to the old one and to large chain hotel apps like Bonvoy and IHG which I will likely focus on more from now on. 

I honestly cannot recommend this app anymore based on rewards that people that are always looking for. | The one key rewards is a scam when you try to redeem it they’ll say it’s expired! Scam! Book with the hotel directly | Love the app!! | All the reasons why not to stay at the Cosmopolitan Hotel . I get to the hotel and the the parking is really far from where you check in . The line to check in is ridiculously long. I waited over an hour. Finally I get to my room so I can chill . Within 10 min my eyes start watering and the sneezing starts. I noticed pet hair all Over the place . So I call the front desk to to let them know the situation. They informed me they are a pet friendly hotel. They changed my room and things didn’t Improve. I checked out a day early because I basically couldn’t breathe normally. All the reasons why not to use Hotels.com I have been try to get hold of someone to tell them my experience and see what they can do for me . This company has 0 customer service. Hopefully someone will see this review and get back to me. I won’t hold my breath. | I just downloaded your app.I can not access any listings.But on online I can access at a higher prices.I just left booking.com over being doubled charged for a cancellation.Are crooks too? | There is an issue.  It keeps popping up that I have several notifications.  They are all messages sent throughout the past four years from hotels.  It has them all marked as unread and I cannot get it to mark them as read.  As soon as I click on them, the revert to unread. | We had a great experience. Everything was very clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful especially Deborah in the breakfast area wouldn’t hesitate booking again. | Don’t use Hotels.com to book, they over book you and refuse to reimburse you even when the hotel agrees to reimburse because of it being their fault ! 
We showed up to our hotel with our son for his birthday with his friends and they didn’t have a room available at the hotel and stated we had to notify hotels.com to cancel and refund our money and we notified them right away and we were told that the refund couldn’t be granted because of rules and restrictions and the hotel has strict policies for this even though the hotel themselves told us to make sure we were refunded!!! | Horrible experience and hotels.com will not post my review. It does not contain profanity, room rates or personal info. I have pictures showing the awful room and they will not refund. This is a horrible company who is not truthful with reviews. They sensor reviews and allow reviews that are good to be posted but not the truthful ones that would make people not want to stay there!! Buyer beware!! | As always flawless and wonderful staff.
Thanks | You cannot use a hotels.com gift card to fully pay for a hotel that says you can pay in full with a gift card. Resort fees cannot be paid with a gift card | Impossible to get a live person. Extremely unsatisfied with app since taken over by Expedia | Easy to use web site. Prices were excellent. Room looks very pleasant and location is ideal. | The bed is very uncomfortable 
Lumpy & saggy 
 Room was clean. Check in was ez.
Service clerk was courteous, attentive, with 100 percent excellent customer service | I can’t figure out how to clear my messages. Very annoying | I need to talk to a live person to help with an issue that is not on the list of options from the virtual agent but it is impossible to get in touch with a live person | The hotel is situated ideally in the city. The rooms are very nice, the lounge is expansive, and the restaurant serves excellent meals. | Customer service is in shambles and the reward program is almost non existent. It’s greed bordering on thievery. I’m leaving and going to booking.com I cannot believe how awful this company is now. | Stayed here for a wedding weekend.  MVP Amanda was very accommodating and helpful with any needs we had to make the weekend special for all people in our group.  The hotel was clean and all staff was polite.  The only complaint I have, which seems to be every hotel we stay at these days, is housecleaning knocked on the door everyday between 8 and 9 wanting to clean.  This happened on the days we were booked to stay as well as the morning  we left.  The first day, we were sleeping in and didn’t answer right away so they came in anyway.  Checkout is not until 11, so I am not sure why they are knocking on the door prior to checkout.  I guess the only way around this is to put the Do Not Disturb sign out. | Overall, a clean, self-contained, economical place to lay down your head convenient to the magnificent Bryce Amphitheater. We didn’t get the note (email) from The Host, so upon arrival to the property in the middle of nowhere, we were greeted by a locked-up building with an orange pylon blocking the driveway. It was disconcerting and we felt marooned in Tropic as the sun set. We enjoyed the views from our car as we dealt with customer service and eventually got a call back from The Host. We were not stuck without prepaid accoms after all. 🥳 The unit has a front porch to take in the scenic views. The interior features a curious mishmosh of materials, including a corrugated metal shower. Bring your own hooks if you want to hang anything up. 😉 Appreciated the microwave oven and fridge. | Messages never clear after having been read.  I keep getting messages to contact hotels I have long since stayed at or canceled the reservation. | Perdi todas mis noches acumuladas , me comuniqué 3 veces con ellos y me dijeron que quedaría en 1 semana ahora que me comunico por que después de 6 meses no recibía mis noches , me dicen que no aplico , que no son transferibles | This family owned establishment made us feel welcome and important. They made us feel welcome and it was such a peaceful stay. | App is fine, but you can’t delete messages, or even make them read. It keeps showing up as unread. Stupid. | Steve was exceptional and made our stay the absolute best! Trey was also amazing as well as the ladies. Thank you all so much!! | This new one-key program is nice to be able to use it over several apps but the reward it self is terrible with the old reward system I was able to stay 10 nights and get a night free I travel a lot for work and personal and now with this terrible reward program I half to stay 65 nights to basically get a free night | But where? How? Poor site | 10 nights equaled a free night at an average nightly rate was an awesome plan.

Current “new” plan doesn’t offer anywhere near the same benefits and we are now utilizing other travel sites to ensure we are getting the best rates AND best benefits from multiple use.  Hard to say you have lost “some” of our business. | Staff was nice and check in process was quick. The parking lot was spacious and close to the rooms. The hotel room was clean, also the towels and the sheets. The closet room is huge. The bed was small for two people (full size). The towels are a little too small, ants were walking on the table, the curtains do not block the light from outside, and you can hear any noise from outside through the windows. Good TV and A/C. The room smell a little unpleasant upon entering. | We reserved a room at a low cost motel, it wasn’t a resort! In a bad area of town! Only a 2 floor motel! And we were charged a $200.00 resort fee! I will never book with Hotels.com again! | Our stay at Chasse Hotel was so enjoyable!  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The room was large and comfortable.  Breakfast was a wonderful selection of typical breakfast offerings and the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten! | I was quoted or suggested price would be $277.. and after checking 355.  
- was above my budget.  From the original quote. So I had to cut my trip short.. 
- recommend an app that will be at least a little closer to there suggest price.. 
this is not the one .. | Embassy suites did not have us booked as we were told by hotels.com Embassy suites worked it out for us and luckily they had a room. But it was a big hassle. Please follow through with hotel, hotels.com !!! | Awful will never use again after 15 years | From the second we arrived, we were greeted with a smile, and we were happily surprised to see that the hotel has bell service. everyone is well dressed and they have fresh flowers everywhere around the hotel.

So easy to use and helpful when multiple stops are needed daily. | It’s a great tool to organize multiple stops and saves you driving time. | I have 7 different routes with just under 100 stops per route per day made my job so much easier!!! 
I had to enter all addresses manually one time once I did 4 years later there still there | It saves so much time…. No more entering everything on Google Maps and trying to figure out the best route - I’m not great with directions, so this has been a life saver for me. | App se cierra inesperadamente y bloquea o congela el iPhone iOS actualizado al último. 
Revisar | Awesome app , simplified my route big time  ! | I’ve made several requests for my subscription to be cancelled because I haven’t been using PlaceMaker for over one year now. Despite my cancelation requests, PlaceMaker continues to take money from my account . I need this to be cancelled and request a refund. | I do a lot of sight seeing and traveling and I love using this app to help me on my route to follow everything I want to do. It saves time from driving all over the place back n forth. | I use this every day for work. It saved me so much time. I can’t live without it. | Very good | Asked to be very helpful and managing my route and my route time for each stop | Nice ! | Pretty accurate 93% of the time (rough estimate),
You can barcode scan or T scan as well as drop a pin or manual type(w/voice command) and the best feature adding notes or pics to describe your package for easy finding | Helps to plot and schedule jobs | Well thought out.... | Not bad at all! | I signed up for the $14.99 monthly in order to be able to use the optimization. For some reason the free trial thing wasn’t working. I like how it re-organizes everything. But I live in Southern California, and the time that it’s estimating for the route is laughable. It’s about three hours too short lol.

So I have my doubts that the route is truly optimized based on traffic? Sure if traffic didn’t exist that would probably be the best route. But some of the choices don’t make sense. I do like that you can route it with 10 stops in Google maps… but that just does those 10 stops, it’s not truly optimizing the whole route with googles traffic engine.

If Support can reach out to me if I’m missing a setting on this | I like how you can somewhat customize. Lots of stops for free. Thanks. | Hola, tengo un iPhone 12 y usaba placemaker para mapear una ruta que me exige que sea con el lector de texto. 

Todo bien hasta que hace un mes comenzó a colgarse la aplicación. Se colocaba una pantalla negra y luego se cerraba la app. A otros compañeros también les sucedió los mismo. Tuvimos que renunciar a la suscripción y cambiarnos a otro proveedor | For the free version it does what I need it to do and it does more I can edit my planned routes and everything, it’s very simple to use and for me only using the free version it’s got tons of features | After the iOS 17 update, I noticed that you longer can input addresses via the search bar. I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling the app but nothing seems to work. | Reading text feature isn’t working | This app is awesome! But I’m having a issue. Every time I back out of the live text option and go back into it, the camera is frozen. I keep having to reopen the app every time I switch stuff around on iOS 17. | Cuando no me deja escanear el código y me da error le doy escanear texto y se queda pegado, no me funciona esa opción y debo hacerlo manual, podrían arreglar eso? Para iPhone 13 Pro, última versión de iOS | Takes a commitment,but becomes intuitive. | Using the app for over two and one half years now. It is the best for the price. Fast and very reliable. They are responsive to any concerns and suggestions also | It’s not working now | Products seemed to work ok for a while but then would not allow me to input stops. Have tried everything I could find as a solution but nothing working.  Will see how the final result turns out | Love, love , love this app!!!!

This lets you not forget prospects!!

When I watch tv and  I see prospects I want to see I add them to this app. 

I can add notes in the app AND I can take pictures of business cards I got when cold calling. 

Because you don’t want to have prospects fall thru the cracks this works great in conjunction with a CRM as well. 

If you try this and don’t love it I will send you a $20 Starbucks gift card. My digital biz card is JohnDWaller.com | Easy to use. Easy to route. Easy read 
It’s just a great and easy app! | I’ve been using this app for almost 3 years now and it saves time and helps me not to forget any stops. | The app is not accurate because I would start working in one area and it will send me back today area ones I left the area. | I’ve tried other apps, they were slow or cumbersome. Place maker is easy, flexible, remembers locations, is shareable. Has timers. It just works! | Use this app daily and it's been a great way to organize the work route. | Place maker is a excellent system for my job, I really rely on its mapping and optimizing features. | I use this for my job everyday and I love it! It’s very easy to use and I prefer it over google maps and Apple Maps multiple stop features. | This is so easy to use. Planning trips with multiple stops and being able to rearrange them easily is great. Much easiest than trying to get the gps to go where you want. Once you map out your trip you can then add to your gps in the order you wish to go. | Justin siuiiiiiiiii7777788.)) hi bu | I bought the more expensive shareable version but wasn’t able to send my route to another user who had the free version. | Use this all the time for work! | Great app for route driver | Why did you changed the size of the map, I have more than 2 years with paid subscription and app worked fine, now you changed the size of my route map, is useless… need to be fixed. | Several times a day it lead me to an address which cannot be accessed. Because there’s a fence or brick wall closing the house off from the busy street. Other than that this app is the best one I’ve used I highly recommend it. | I use this app for when I have multiple jobs to go to in a day and have to get there with using my time and gas efficiently. It’s great but I usually have to set up my stops on my own and then just refer back to the app. I also have a hard time figuring out how to save a bunch of stops | Outstanding tool. Perfect for me. | Sometime the app doesn't run like it frozen. I have iphone 13 pro max and good conexión | I use this app almost every day! There are free versions that are similar, but this app is well worth it’s weight in gold👍 | Great App | I’m a visiting nurse. I don’t know what I would do without this app! | Organizing the day’s route is a breeze with this app!

Put some more effort into this and put a couple bucks on the price. | AO never fails to derail me from my serious scrolling as the tales and photos capture my mind …. Every time !!! | Best app to learn the back story or find interesting sites near you or along the way during your travels! I have learned so much and turned my kids into sleuths as we travel! Fun way to engage your kids as you explore! | We use AO all the time during our travels. There are so many cool things to do and see. We recommend it to any of our friends that are traveling. Great app. | I installed it and to its credit it did have some neat information. It’s locked in the position where it installed and can’t be moved. I tried to uninstall it and I cannot. It’s been he only app on my phone that isn’t iPhone proprietary that doesn’t allow it to be uninstalled. I don’t trust this app and want it gone. | enjoy it on a daily basis. this is the way i start my day. we bought the boxed book set too. | Honestly the community is amazing but the app is so riddled with bad ux and ui decisions like why are yall making an api call every time i change a filter just make the whole thing when i hit done?? Hire me to fix your app i am begging you | Love this site!! I use it everywhere I travel and enjoy seeing and experiencing more things than the average tourist. I am always amazed at the awesome Sites and little known destinations that they have compiled. I even used it near my house in upstate New York and despite living in the area for 44 years, still found cool places I’d never heard of or been to. I tell everyone that is going anywhere to use Atlas Obscura | Atlas Obscura is not just an app; it’s a magic carpet ride to the most extraordinary corners of our planet. Its user-generated content brings to light the less trodden paths and uncovers sights and landmarks that traditional guides often overlook. This app is the epitome of adventure and discovery, perfect for those yearning to explore beyond the ordinary.

The interface of Atlas Obscura is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through its vast network of wonders. Whether you’re a seasoned traveler or a curious explorer in your backyard, the app tailors its discoveries to suit your location and interests. It’s like having a knowledgeable friend in your pocket, always ready to show you something fascinating.

One of the most striking features of Atlas Obscura is the diversity of its content. From awe-inspiring natural formations to quirky roadside attractions, the app covers an eclectic mix of places that are both informative and entertaining. Each location is accompanied by detailed descriptions, user reviews, and often, mesmerizing photographs that stir the wanderlust in you.

Moreover, the app fosters a sense of community among users. You can contribute by adding new locations, sharing your experiences, or offering tips, which makes Atlas Obscura a living, evolving atlas of the world’s wonders. This communal aspect adds depth to the app, making it more than just a guide—it’s a platform for sharing and discovery.

However, it’s important to note that while Atlas Obscura opens the door to hidden gems, some locations might require careful planning to visit. The app does a great job in providing essential information, but it’s always wise to do additional research, especially for remote or less accessible places.

In conclusion, Atlas Obscura is a treasure trove for adventurers and curious souls. It’s an invitation to step off the beaten path and plunge into a world of fascinating discoveries. For anyone looking to spice up their travels with unique, offbeat destinations, this app is a must-have. It’s not just about places; it’s about experiencing the myriad stories and wonders that our world has to offer. | I absolutely swear by using this app when I travel to find amazing sightseeing and experiences and real world ""Easter eggs""... but it isn't without its frustrastions:

- Currently, newly marked places I've visited no longer give me a grey flag. This makes it confusing to see where I should go next. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling even, to no avail.
- After awhile with the app in use, you'll get an error message ""something went wrong"" and can't mark anything, and you'll need to restart the app and refind the location to mark. I've had this problem since I started using this a whole year ago and it is still not resolved!!

Also, as a suggestion, I like that places that are permanently closed are still featured, but could be helpful to give them a distinguished color marker, like red or something (but still allow gray flag for those who visited before shutdown). 

Also, when clicking ""Directions"", it uses my Google Maps, but would be nice if it have me the option to use Apple Maps instead (like Happy Cow app lets me do). 

I want to give it 5 stars, but these bugs sometimes break my flow while I'm exploring. | Good content for atlas obscura but really the app needs some work. Jerky, hangs, not usable at times. | Never fails to enlighten and inform with fascinating articles. | I’ve only been working with the app for a couple of hours but I’m finding it very difficult to navigate.  It’s not intuitive, its slow and clunky. I’m finding basic tasks,  like adding the countries I’ve been to,  really hard to complete.  Maybe it’s me, and I just need more time with it but I still feel like it shouldn’t be this hard to work with. | I love Atlas Obscura, and this app is overall wonderful but I sure wish links would open in the app rather than my browser | Only got this yesterday - it’s great. Helps with vacation planning in a big way. | I love the website and the content, but the app is janky. One major issue is it hangs when trying to filter results. | This app works well and the information is great! I have so many places I want to see and so many I’ve seen and I can put both in separate lists. | Awesome app for the travel who likes off the beaten path. Only downside is the actual map, hard to use on a iPhone. | I travel a lot for work and my photography hobby, and I *love* going to the places I see on this app. Doing so helps me learn about the history, architecture, ecosystems, and sometimes reveals photo opportunities I wouldn’t have found on my own. It also keeps growing as people add sites so if I go to the same city multiple times there are sometimes new suggestions to check out. I love it! | My family and I love this app. They were many times that we went on vacation and ran out of things to do so we open the app and search for surroundings. | I love atlas Obscura, but the app is glitchy. When you are trying to view places, it won’t let you click the lists and clicking a hashtag doesn’t work very well either. | Earth’s most exciting travel app. You’re shortcut to what is interesting and off the beaten path. | We just had a wonderful lunch there. The wait went by quickly the food was delicious. Best of all our server, Claudia was delightful. Highly recommend First Watch. | Great app, fun when you travel to a new place! 
Cleveland Rocks! | One of the top 10 apps on the App Store. The store would not be complete without it. | A must-have for any avid traveller. Full of surprising finds and always interesting to explore! 🌏 🌎 🌍 | My scoring of 0 was completely wrong. 
5 Baby! | Love road trips and unusual attractions. This is a perfect road trip companion! | Hard to figure out and save routes and attractions | After starting a list, the newly created one doesn’t appear in selection to add other locations. Also no way to delete lists. | Any time I go anywhere, I check with Atlas Obscura to see what else I could see there | Would like to see an iPad version of the app.  The content is great and a more advanced search would be fantastic! | I’ve used this app and their website to find the lesser known attractions. I love the history and stories. You will too! I tell all my friends and family about this whenever they say they are traveling . | Glad this is finally in app form, but sad the add location feature is broken since I know some wonderful nooks and crannies | The app is really hard to navigate and is missing features from the website. It’s a completely different experience, so if you like the site you probably won’t like the app and vice versa | I love the obscurity | I would love to hear a podcast or read about the Tarahumara abilities to run and how they live | Trying to add places I’ve been to the map, not working. | The world has nothing but bad news, or so it seems.  This is a reason to turn on the iPad. | Right out of the gate it’s my first time using the app and it will not simply load when I try to pick an interest to search 🤦‍♂️. Closed the app and tried again and it still just sits on the loading categories screen and never loads anything. WTH? | AO is an amazing resource | This app is my favorite now! I love seeing new interesting places to check out of just admirer. Make a Bucket list! Lol very well made and beautiful pictures to boot! | Traveling in London and Paris, and this app has amazing info for finding the most interesting and unusual sites. But if you want to use the app features (been there, want to go, new place, etc) it often doesn’t work. It just says to try again, and again and again. | Look I love atlas obscura and I use this app literally all the time. It has serious bugs- when you press the options to note if you’ve been to a place or would like to go to it, the app freezes for a time until it’s ok to use again. Very slow. Also, the loading takes a really long time with the ad at the start, like 1-2 minutes. It crashes often, or forgets my login info and I have to restart the app. In general, it’s not very good. I turn to using just the regular atlas obscura page in my browser often when out and about to compensate, but I want to use this app with amazing potential! It just needs a thorough debugging and someone with good coding skills to go through, put some money on this atlas obscura, it could be so so great. Also there should be a rating system for entries- some things on here aren’t really fit for the “obscura” definition, like boring historians get lost, get cooler, find better spots that fit here not just random history factoids that amuse you but nobody else. It needs a clean up and more curating by users. | It is absolutely excruciating to try to figure this app out. First of all it’s a Google wannabe. It’s literally a glorified Google. You can only pin what is already posted. Meaning if you have been in London, you can only pin the map of places that are available from the list. Absolutely ridiculous. If you want to add a place it has to go through a review, whom knows how long that takes. I am not wasting anymore of my time with this app | I use Atlas Obscura on all my travels.  I’ve shared it with many friends.  Truly a highly useful app. | Is this app meant to be useable past the home page? | So glad this exist!! | It has been fun finding out of the way spots.",4.8414,5725,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a0/0b/63/a00b633f-db29-5939-7420-cee7836a1c66/0942b8a4-5ab1-4e5e-87a8-abf02081e566_WF_ios_5.5_f1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/78/50/ae/7850ae29-4444-2314-bd4f-523f0d9409b7/b11d185a-2251-4e4f-b34d-06f5263f490c_WF_ios_5.5_f2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/72/f3/14/72f31441-b707-b26f-1237-5cf77f54a92e/6f2f951a-9d09-46da-b7f3-96820a68259e_WF_ios_5.5_f3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/95/c8/d4/95c8d471-6e7d-d0f6-f12c-8cf01ef8eddc/dd00c127-73f6-42c1-a5fc-2072f3f0eb79_WF_ios_5.5_f4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/3d/1f/89/3d1f8973-5f01-d068-6f9c-5d83e4fb7fce/0db11b98-90f7-41f8-859b-be4d82bd14e8_WF_ios_5.5_f5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/87/04/3c/87043cf5-e521-7375-1016-147119cbed0c/30734091-e797-4b71-9ab1-0a18940249e8_WF_ios_5.5_f6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1f/f2/97/1ff2971d-fbf8-ef13-7449-c2a5e83f9c5d/84013de7-beff-4b9c-912e-9ff295e0e474_WF_ios_5.5_f7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8f/3a/3c/8f3a3cd8-a08a-1949-53a9-e521701d75bd/b1571c37-6325-47aa-94d5-b6704a8d7dbc_WF_ios_5.5_f8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/50/84/95/50849554-3d25-013e-9e43-bee00578f884/5a64984f-840f-4a37-b04e-0ff00f47ef06_WF_ios_5.5_f9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/8b/fa/1e/8bfa1e96-2afb-4c7f-3830-4de1684a820e/ae552cc7-6f2c-4aac-bde4-c7e7a8e0d1d4_WF_ios_5.5_f10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I paid $140 in baggage fees and only received 2 bags. Scammers . | I liked! | I feel like this is a scam site. Over this last year that I’ve had the app, I’ve attempted to purchase tickets at the cheap price displayed. And every time I have clicked to make payment, the very next window shows an increased price. 

This is not because the prices go up immediately… because I had my wife then use her computer to go to the site/app and she would still see the lower price, therefore it’s not increased. It only increases once they know you’re interested in the flight and click to pay. As an example, a flight that was approximately $200 each. Once we put in our payment info and tried to pay, the total was just under $700… the flights that I’ve attempted to book all jumped in total price by 300% to 400%. 

Again, this site / app feels like a scam and I’m concerned with how they get your payment info and only then they give this highly inflated total. 

I have this app in my phone under the label of Scam.  I won’t trust them and I’ve told others to stay away from it.

I have not verified that sharing is seamless, but I love the app so much that I didn’t want to wait to review, | Creating everything is easy, but plan to only travel in the time zone you created the itinerary in. I travelled from US to EU and for some stupid reason, Plip developers thought it would make sense to change the times on my itinerary to the local time. 

So instead of waking up for breakfast at 9am,
I’m now waking up at 4am and my entire schedule is shifted and there’s nothing I can do to shift it back. | At first, I loved the app. But as soon as my travel started all of the times of my events changed. And it wasn’t even the proper time change if that was what they were trying to do. It was exactly 12 hours forward for everything. Very bit pain. Terrible “feature” - you should be able to revert it and/or say you’re already planning in the time zone you’re going to. | Not intuitive to set up and use. Took a lot of clicking on different items to figure it out. Don’t forget your password as the the Forgot Password link doesn’t work. Without password, there is no way to contact them. Catch 22. | i love this app!! great place to ensure you’re not double booked and plan with other members of your group! easy to keep track of every confirmation number, times, dates, and location of all trip events!!! | Very helpful planing trips across Europe. Allows user to add details to plan a trip and share easily with others. Great app. | Great app and love how it organizes all my trip details...BUT you can’t sync to outlook OR print the trip out?!?  Spent hours putting details - travel, hotel, meal reservations, excursion reservations, etc. before realizing we couldn’t sync to calendar or print it out. | Hands downs best trip planner app with friends, simple, organized, and efficient. | I found the app really easy to use. If you’re a planner and want to keep everyone on the same page, this is a fun way to plan a trip collaboratively. | A great way to keep all my travel plans and arrangements in one place. I now know where I’ll be when, how I’m getting there and all the details I need. Very clever.  Easy even for an old guy. I love that the app automatically inserts an image of the event location. Very cool. | Easy to use app that makes the complication of planning trips 100x simpler. All the details on one page - flight, hotel, reservations, food, car rentals. I love how you can share the inventory with your friends so everyone is on the same page. Highly recommend for anyone who is planning a trip and likes to stay organized. | Plip is my go-to resource for trip planning. I’ve used it to plan local day trips with family, global trips for business, and to daydream about my future post-COVID plans. It’s super easy to use, helps you keep your travel plans all in one place, and ensures that everyone is on the same page. I recommend plip to anyone getting ready for a trip - big or small.

Wish I found it before, would have made my trip planing less painful and time consuming . | Phew this app made it easy to plan my trip. Was able to include all my friends that way I didn’t have to share my plans individually with each person. One place to go get all the information made it easy to create plans and be on the same page. Woo! | Love the app! It’s very simple to use and is exactly what I need to plan out my travels.

No ad opt-out | Objectively worse than the supercharger search in the official Tesla app. Doesn’t provide any info like charging cost. Shoves ads in your face.

Sometimes my phone's connection cuts out, which makes me worried if I need to show proof of fare to inspectors which requires an active network connection.

It also has very poor walking directions when trying to connect from one bus/tram to another. I essentially only use it to see when my late bus is actually arriving. Otherwise quite fussy to use with a thousand buttons that make simple tasks feel overly complicated.

1670305867,"com.montgomery.rideon","Ride On Trip Planner","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ride-on-trip-planner/id1670305867?uo=4","Montgomery County Department of Transportation (MCDOT) partnered with Moovit, a global bus trip planning mobile app software company, to launch a new Ride On Trip Planner – a Ride On bus passenger load and local trip planning app. This new, innovative app will allow riders to plan their next trip and to tell how crowded a Ride On bus is – before it arrives – with the crowdedness indicator on the app riders can  choose if they want to get on the bus arriving, wait for the next bus depending on how many people are on the bus, or choose another travel option, such as other local transit services, bikeshare, and scooter. It gives riders more control over their transportation experience. The app also includes dashboards for the Ride On Central Communications team to monitor bus loads and more quickly dispatch additional buses when buses are full.

The Ride On Trip Planner app is easy to use and can be downloaded from the Apple app store. Riders choose their current location and their destination and then pick the most desirable route that fits their travel plans. Once the route is chosen, the app will give the exact time the next bus will arrive, while providing step-by-step directions on how to get to the bus stop and how to get to the rider’s destination after getting off the bus. The app will also notify riders when it's time to get off so they can browse other apps and surf the web, without having to worry about missing their stop. The app was created to alleviate stress and worry about bus times and continue to reduce the spread of infectious diseases with the crowdedness indicator.

This Ride On Trip Planner app is being funded by a federal grant to help the community continue to travel locally in a safe and more efficient way. This partnership is a two-year pilot to test the combined Ride On passenger load and trip planning functionalities in the County and beyond. After the pilot is completed, decisions will be made on whether to keep this application, expand its capabilities, or use it to replace the current Ride On Real Time application, based on feedback from County residents and other users.    


The Ride On Trip Planner solution is based on Moovit’s long-running robust native and web transit apps designed for endless scale and serving 100s of millions of users worldwide, with zero downtime. 
The application features:  

•	Multimodal trip planning – in addition to Ride On route options, it will include other options like local transit services, bikeshare and scooter options
•	Real-time arrivals
•	Customized micro-mobility integrations

The Ride On Trip Planner app solution includes the iPhone app, which benefits from Moovit’s rich user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), as well as comprehensive transit data, developed in partnerships with some of the most well-known transit, mobility and accessibility organizations worldwide.

The Ride On Trip Planner app will feature a range of accessibility capabilities to benefit users with disabilities, including blindness or low vision, ambulatory impairments, and hand-motor disabilities, enabling them to use public transit confidently and maximize their opportunities in the workplace, education, and social life. 

The Moovit technology has more than 1.7 billion users in 112 countries, 3,500 cities, 7,500 transit agencies, and in 45 languages, and is a leading Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) solutions company and the world’s most popular urban mobility app, making getting around cities easier and more convenient.

No route alternative! Just let me plug in my bus number and give me the schedule!!! | This one is free, has no ads or limitations, and includes all the local modes of transit. It is better than all other similar apps that cover DC and MoCo. Well done. | Good | This app has huge potential and the interface is overall really good. 

However I have noticed on several occasions that the bus does not connect to the GPS real time tracking. Just now, a Route 12 bus went by that wasn’t tracked and so I missed it, thinking the next bus would be in 10 or more minutes.

Auditing the buses to ensure that they are properly connected to the App’s real-time GPS system would be helpful. This is an ongoing issue. If I could trust the real time, it would make me choose to use Ride On buses more often. | Siempre se nota la amabilidad y la entrega al servicio de cada uno de los conductores | Very good | Very good | This app has really helped me plan my day around the bus schedules which I’ve felt to be very reliable. F4 being my favorite | I enjoy using this app for both my regular commute as well as when I need to travel to or from new neighborhoods. The trip planner helps me find the best place to leave from, and once I’m on the bus, I’m grateful for the stop notifier. I love that I get alerts when my stop is next! | I love this app when it works it’s SO helpful for planning and getting places on time. But it just never works. Like it is always showing me the wrong times (next bus at 9:45 am or even 5 am when it is currently 7:00 am and I know the bus schedule for this route) or the routes to get a certain place are just wrong - sometimes it wants me to switch buses when it’s objectively better to stay on the same bus??? It’s very very frustrating.PLEASE fix this ride on 😭😭🙏🙏 | The app often shows an hour for every route, but sometimes the time disappear or the line comes early | Awesome | When it is working properly, this app is helpful. It can suggest routes and give an estimate of when the next bus will arrive.  I have occasionally had problems with phantom buses, that is that it says there is a bus coming but I never see it.  Also it is limited in what routes it will suggest. There are times when I know that I can walk 2 blocks and probably get an earlier bus, but there is no way to check them in the app. | Best Ride Ever!!!!!!!! | The two busses on my route (34 and 4) tend to run early or late but without the live location working, I often miss them. Can you ensure all the busses have their live locator on? This round resolve the problem for me. | Since I’m an old guy, and find myself standing for 20 minutes, very difficult, the app is extremely valuable in planning when I will arrive at a bus stop and will not have a long wait without any place to sit down. I have no idea why the county does not provide benches, but knowing when the bus will arrive, greatly reduces my standing time. | This week alone I’ve had terrible luck with the app which is normally good. I’ve been told a bus is arriving, go to wait for it, only for it to be the bus on the opposite side of the road when it tells me it is not that bus. | Seeing where buses are in real time is cool and all, but on my first time trying to use this app to navigate it took me to the wrong bus stop two separate times. You’re better off using Google Maps. | I can rely on this app because it has accurate data and live updates.  I spend less time waiting because I don’t need to get to the bus stop earlier “just in case” | Love this. Works well and is easy to use! | I appreciate how good the routes are. Great step for an app. | Waiting for this app for long time, now I don’t have to call for any info can easily

The drive was 12 hours and weather forecast was accurate throughout the trip.     

It is a fantastic way to locate good weather for day trips.  No more bad weather adventures. | This is a delightfully useful app for knowing the weather along your travel route.

You can change the timeline to see if changing the timing of your departure will let you avoid bad weather or seek good weather.

You can even see radar forecasts for the expected time you’ll be in a particular area.

If you’re looking for an app to help plan routes based on weather this is it. | Easy to use.  So useful. ❤️ | Have been a full subscription holder.  Inevitably the app wants me to res subscribe, restores my subscription then won’t let me access the app.  Really good concept, very flighty.  Seems to work on my iPad, not on my iPhone. | There are many better weather apps! | I met a friend at a former job. A great guy that genuinely cares about people’s safety and growth.
I told him about the company I was employed at and the type of trailers I would be pulling. He looked at the routes and immediately told me to download this app and to upgrade to the premium service in order to have better route planning due to weather.
Without him, I’d still be fumbling with other weather apps and guessing and hoping.
Thanks John for everything that you do. You’re a rare person and one that I proudly call friend!!!!
Take care of Lily. | I used the free version of this app for a road trip from Minnesota to St. Pete Beach,FL.  There was rain and thunder storms shown on the app and the location and intensity shown was spot-on with reality!  I used the radar overlay to help me decide whether to pull off and wait out the storm or press on and get through it.  I pressed on and was out of it in 30 min but if I’d waited it out I would have been delayed for hours as the storm cell was large and moving west to east and I was going north to south. Highly recommend! | Driving to new areas in winter is anxiety producing and careless unless you have this app. Knowing when to reroute made our trip from Texas to northern Nevada possible to keep driving safely. Thx | How do you develop an app for driving with maps and not include Airports for destinations. Wow dude! Really?! | You saved our bacon.  During recent heavy atmospheric river storms in the west, your ap. helped us get through the Sierra mountain snow storms by showing us a slim widow of safe passage time. Thank you!! | I’ve been using this app for the first time on a road trip from Arizona to Washington with constant storms coming in off the Pacific Ocean.  

Wow, has this app been amazing at planning my travel days and times!  Thank you! | Useful when traveling to see weather conditions ahead | Wanted to try a weather related travel app before subscribing, but the app offer zero features unless you subscribe.  I couldn’t even get a bare bones forcast without subscribing.  It may be a great app, but you’ll have to pay to find out | This app doesn’t allow you to even use it unless you pay for it. Addresses are only allowed when you pay for a subscription. Lame app. | Paid my dues for 2024 and I can’t get it to work. Will try to contact IT Monday. 
Denise | I am generally stingy with five-star reviews, but simply MUST award one to DriveWeather! My mid-January Michigan-to-Massachusetts drive in a packed box-truck would have been an horribly anxious ordeal without it. WITH IT (for its $5.99 full-utility subscription-fee…), however, I knew precisely what to anticipate and I am relieved to say that its forecasts were shockingly accurate both in terms of timing and intensity of the weather. When I hit heavy snow in the pridelands of WNY I knew to expect it AND when to expect it to pass. DriveWeather NAILED IT!!

I would venture to guess that it is free-mode the app would have done alot less to allay my fears of heavy weather and to inform my plan for safety's and timing's sakes. Don't cheap out to your own travail. Pay the subscription fee as you are planning your drive and put the full power of this amazing tool at your disposal. | The app overall is good except 2 things. Yearly price and design of the app. User interface (design) it’s one of the worst I’ve ever seen!
Your app needs redesign, than will worth a 5 stars. This app should be a $10 max, cause it’s just a weather app. I would pay for 1 year subscription l, but $18 for weather app it’s kinda a lot! | Planned on leaving because drive weather showed it to be clear on our planned route. Woke up this morning ready to leave to find 2” of snow and ice that drive weather didn’t predict | If you don’t mind paying for information that’s free elsewhere, then this app is for you. | This app has such promise, but certain aspects don’t perform consistently or at all which makes it extremely frustrating to use. The time slider doesn’t ever appear when you add a waypoint. To set the time, then, you have to go back and edit the default which is 1:00.  This requires tapping twice, but the time slider rarely appears regardless. So, I can only plan for the first day of a multi day trip rendering the app useless. When I shared my route with Waze, the precipitation forecast didn’t appear. I thought it would, but sharing the route with Waze, Apple Maps or Google Maps was never addressed in the instructions (nor was history or how to set favorites), so I have no way of knowing. I emailed the developer twice, but never received a response.  Great potential, but app needs some work. | Looking for a good road weather app. I’ll try paying apps. Buying apps is no prob for me. This one has the annoying pop ups to buy. Got 5 pop ups within maybe few minutes to have me choose. | This app is really helpful with winter weather. I was unsure on something and support responded minutes. | This app is by far the most helpful for travel. It’s incredibly simple to use yet provides a ton of important info. It saved us this trip from ending up in the middle of the winters worst storm - we stayed a second day at our campground and then followed the storm, in clear dry weather. Best $ I’ve spent on a travel app!! | I appreciate this app. I really do. I use it when I drive 8 hours to visit my mom. Weather's a bear. But I'm priced out of it now. I don't mind spending $20 or $30 in an app but I don't drive enough to pay almost $20/yr for the occasional use. Also, I feel like it's gotten much more expensive the past couple years vs when I first signed on. From 9.99 to 12.99 to now 17.99—for the pro version, which I'm not sure even existed when I first I first started using the app and, aside from being able to look out seven days ahead, I'm not sure what the pro version brings to the party for the extra money. This last price increase has me out. | Not California friendly | I installed this app. After a brief review, I went PRO! 
The response of developers on questions and process, was phenomenal. 20 minutes, and a brief conversation via email, my issue was resolved. 
Point of record: This IS a REAL TIME app! I’m looking forward to YEARS of using it. | I loved this app when I first got it last year. It was a life saver as I was traveling back and forth from Iowa to Minnesota every weekend. But the last two months I have found that it takes forever to give me the details. And more often it just keeps spinning and spinning never giving me my data. Even after the update I’m still having issues with it just spinning/calculating. Sad as I relied on this a lot for timing my trips. | This app has helped me so much on my 700 mile trips between the Oregon Coast and central California! Kept me prepared and safe especially in  winter. Thank you | Subscription increase and for the last month it is so buggy it is worthless. Plan a route and last leg doesn’t show weather. Waypoints and stop overs constantly mess up with times. This app was much better before.

Updated: dev response was dumb. They should test more instead of blaming the customer of not using it correct. Have had this app for a long time. Last few updates are not stable. | Worth the price for truck drivers or anyone traveling. | Not only do you need to pay to type in address numbers but the developers responses to these reviews is gross. Your app is not that amazing to be acting that way and you should be thankful anyone even pays for this garbage. | There are very few apps that I will pay for.  But, as an intermittent traveler, this one practically pays for itself for the important and accurate weather info it provides.  
It’s clear that they care about how their app works when you look at the version history. They are constantly fine-tuning it to be even better. 
The sliding “leave” time scale is immensely helpful in avoiding bad weather and calculating driving in the dark. It doesn’t stop there. Wind, temperature, freezing rain, etc. are all easily shown.  It even shows the likelihood of the various conditions.
Yes, they've raised the price of this app recently by $2 but unlike other apps, I am happy to pay for it for the ease of use and peace of mind while on the road. | Use this app every time we are planning a trip and during trip…great info for deterring weather on multiple routes! | I drive a lot between Oregon and California. This app has been so helpful! After a month of using the free version I decided to upgrade. Both the free and the premium apps are great though! So simple to use and the accuracy has been spot on for me! | After watching the video tutorial, I decided the UI was not vetted with any sort of formal usability testing making it difficult to see and use. But, I was still considering purchasing- then read the reviews. The developer seems arrogant and contentious is his responses - and frankly I don’t have time to deal with a prima donna. Sir, even if you are utterly convinced you are right, you will not be successful if you feel you must “win” every interaction with a customer. Some humility and grace will build a customer base as opposed to alienating the very people you need to adopt your app. | Apple sent me 3 notifications after I downloaded this useless app and gave them my Apple Card info. Apparently this app tried to charge me $49 three times, even though I didn’t sign up for any paid features. Absolute scammers!! Avoid! EDIT: the response from the developer is baloney. There was no third party. I downloaded the app from here. And it DID ask me for credit card information claiming they want charge it unless I sign up for services. But as soon as I gave them my Apple Card information, I immediately got charged $49 x3 from strange websites. That literally never happened to me and I’ve been using Apple Card for a long time. So that was most definitely connected with this fraudulent app. Avoid! | The version - 8.16.0 does not work. It gets hung up on the “Gathering weather data” animation. This on an iPad Pro (12.9 inch) (5th generation) running iOS ver. 17.1.1
NOTE: As instructed no Drive Weather, I had to delete the app and installer newer version: 8.16.2 - now it works. | I like to try the app before I buy. There isn’t even a lite version to try. | This is what I was looking for as I drive 30,000/yr. I found the app very accurate and am able to plan my trips avoiding unnecessary weather conditions. I could have used this last year when we had a snow blizzard with high winds, drifting snow and low visibility. If I had this app I would have chosen to drive the next day avoiding the long delays……a 5 hour drive turned into a 9+ hour drive. UGH! I highly recommend this app! | Since the last iOS update the app hasn’t worked. | I’m having issues with it all it dose is download forever and never gives me the weather I want my money worth’s | Just purchased pro, so we’ll see how this works on upcoming trip.  I’d like this app to have the capability to SHARE routes with family/loved ones, so they can see weather conditions too.  If this functionality can be added, I’ll update to 5 ⭐️.  Otherwise, pretty cool.  I’ve already plotted our trip and as expected, it’s going to be nasty drive with the wind and ice.  At least we’ll know what to expect driving the route, in real time. | DriveWeather was the app I was looking for to plan out a cross-country route based on future weather forecasts. Not only is the app well thought out, it's easy to use and flexible. Plus the developer is super responsive (even on Thanksgiving Day!). This is the best example of how apps should be developed and supported by every developer! Well done Concept Elements LLC! 

***Oh and by the way, the cost to ""own"" this app is very reasonable compared to the monthly and annual subscriptions of other apps that do not have a fraction of the features.*** | This App is a life saver.  If you ever need to ensue a safe driving experience when traveling, this app will prove to be invaluable.  I have been using it for the past two years…. Dennis | Saves time and frustration knowing what weather you’re likely to encounter on your next trip. Great tool when planning a route. | I have been using this app for several years. It is by far the best, most accurate, most user-friendly, and easiest approach to projecting weather for upcoming travel days. A+++++ | I live in the “frozen North” and Winter Travel can be treacherous.  This app helps in planning the route and the time of travel. | Inconsistencies keep me from rating as high as I’d like. When you’re planning a long distance multi-day trip this is genius. In fact I’d pay more if it were consistent and reliable. I understand weather forecast have never been reliable. That understood, I travel enough and use multiple sources to know this app Sometimes misses. Some trips it’s good, some trips it’s been unreliable. And . . . Quirks seem to come and go. You just don’t know when those quirks are going to crop up. But, they do appear to get fixed. Hope they can continue to develop into something I don’t have to double check before setting out. Again, the concept is Genius. 

UPDATE: biggest and most prominent problem with app is Wind Gusts out beyond 48-60 hrs. App will give constant wind speed days out but not wind gusts. Gusts can be the problem (especially across bridges) and I would like to see improvement there. These guys work hard to provide a very valuable service. | App was great until a few months ago when it will not update and plan route.. it just keeps circling and circling | Have used this app for a few years & has always worked. Haven’t used for a few months now & all I get is the spinning wheel. Have always loved the app

These little cabins are even better than pictured. No detail has been missed. It’s clean, the bed is comfy, the view is beautiful, and the location is great. So close to town square and cute restaurants. Be sure to drive over to Calfkiller Brewery—another gem. Truly can’t think of one bad thing to say, this place is the Bee’s Knees! | Absolutely stunning and wonderful gal Jennifer who runs this place. So many butterflies and bees and birds, she takes pride in her piece of heaven. Thanks for sharing your place with the public! -Jen from WA | Perhaps it’s been the areas where I’ve traveled, but have had several incidents where camp spots were not as described and I didn’t have a good way to find another safe place to camp. I found Hipcamp to be not only unhelpful in addressing the camp issues, but they shut down my ability to provide an accurate review on their site. From issues with extreme trash, loose dogs and a locked camp where I couldn’t get in and was very far away from any other options to a place where pictures were extremely misleading and the “quiet” camp spot ended up being next to a road and access to internet wasn’t available I have found this service less reliable than simply using the internet and Google reviews. | Love Hipcamp! Super easy to use. | There’s a terrible bug in the app. After I’ve viewed a few properties, I start seeing the camp sites from the previous property I looked at showing up in latest property I just clicked on. I’ve tried closing and restarting the app several times and it doesn’t seem to fix the issue. This is making it impossible to choose a camp site for our holiday. | I like many of the options of HipCamp.

Things that could be better…

First…
It would be nice to see your favorite button have a map selection for doing a road trip and seeing all your saved locations visually spaced.
Saved spots should have a heart logo over them when searching around the map.

Secondly…
Photos assorted by groups (like realtor.com)
Group 1: tent sites
Group 2: bathrooms (if any) and photos inside
Group 3: amenities 
Group 4: grounds
Group 5: off camp grounds of places nearby | You are unable to get ahold of their customer service, you have to message with their bot who files a “ticket” that they are supposed to respond to but you will never heard back from them. Unfortunately the host we booked with lied about amenities and I’m having trouble getting a refund after having to book other accommodations. | Your App constantly hangs up locks up, covers the screen so it’s impossible to return to other screens I quit using it because it’s such a hassle this is a new iPhone it’s your app. | I just spent 20 minutes writing a review and when I selected the post button it blew up 
I think the link is broken, and then I could not find a way to write a new one, maybe you can find it in a log somewhere a post it | We arrived and our host was not there, but we communicated over email. We had the place to ourselves; quiet, lovely view, bathroom and water. We never saw Clay! | Right by a creek, with great fire pit, and secluded at night. The hosts were very nice and helpful. Things we did not anticipate were people talking on the trail very close by that woke us up every morning that we could see constantly through the day and a very intense work out. I mean, incredible endurance up and down trek to the camp site to get gear for camping. So if you expect total privacy and complete relaxation without any effort, pick somewhere else. Otherwise, this place has some definite beauty with the sacrifice. | great visit.   they even brought flowers and made the site pretty. | I was on a road trip with my spouse and children when we discovered Bob's land at the last minute. We arrived after sunset, were not in the mood for camping, and the kids were exhausted. Bob's Popup was not set up because the season had not yet begun, and he is welcome to stay at the campsite. But when he met us, he changed his mind and instantly set up the Popup. In all of my travels, I've never encountered a more kind, friendly, and compassionate host. The campsite has a river in front of us, and there is a lot of wildlife. Bonfire is allowed, clean, cold water and compost toilets are available. Highly recommended place for camping! | First night done and it was amazing but we always setup multiple hammocks and prefer to just go hammock camping when possible. Could you set up a sub category for that???? | Super stoked to start using this. Me and my dog are first time campers and would like to make it a lifestyle, and I was finding it extremely difficult to find place for us that weren’t booked, had breed restrictions, or restricted dogs all together. Thank you for this app! | We are continually impressed with your software. It makes sharing our space with others a pleasant experience. Your guest communication platform is quite helpful. We can offer help with their campfire etc without going into their space. If my husband has reached out to them I am in the loop as well. The confirmed booking list is great for a quick reminder who our next guest is. 

Again thank you for all your hard work on this platform. We really appreciate it. | Off the Beaten Path Adventures love using Hipcamp on our travel trips.  It’s so easy to search and make reservations even at last minute. Every host so far has been great and helpful.  Keep up the good work. | The one experienced I had the provider of the campsite completely completely lied about the description! It was dirty didn’t look anything like it was pictured! It’s literally described as a cave, and there is no cave it was a tarp that was over a rocky area that wasn’t even present when I arrived. The sofa situation that they had picture which looked like a bed was torn apart by wild animals and left tossed all over the place. The campfire was a mess and had trash by it. | Our host was absolutely wonderful, Cheryl went out of her way to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. It was the most beautiful place to watch the Eclipse! | With several apps to choose from, we chose Hipcamp due to it’s target group, easy use and resources.  As a first time host, we set up a small camp for the 2024 eclipse and drew in the best group of campers!  Thanks so much for a great kickoff. We look forward to years of use and happy campers!  Robert | Wow, just found Hipcamp and so glad I did. I searched multiple areas to figure out what would work best for us. The reservation was super easy to make!! | I was charged for a booking that was never used as had made a booking, but then I couldn’t get a hold of the host and so I tried to make another booking so I have a place for that evening, but I also couldn’t get a hold of them and so I ended up getting a hotel and I was not reimbursed for thestay because Hipcamp leaves it up to the host to refund and of course this host does not want to refund, but they’re listing said they were next to a pack and a trail which was untrue. They were next to a busy intersection of a 6 Lane Rd. and a neighborhood that does not welcome camping in the backyard so I definitely felt unsafe I will not be booking again. It was too confusing and I spent way too much money and I didn’t get a refund for what I got. | Everything from the perfect directions from Susan our Camp Host, to the beautiful working farm, to the great graveled site accommodating our 35ft fifth wheel was just wonderful. The rv sites have access to bathrooms and a kitchen. No Wi-Fi, but if you have access to hot spot on your phone your good. The farm is located about 30 minutes from Williamsburg VA and there’s a Food Lion grocery about 7-8 miles away. We will definitely recommend this camp and will be back if we get back this way! | We really loved our stay at this ranch. Dax was very friendly and welcoming. The river was beautiful. Lots of wildlife made it fun. Dax provided great firewood and picked us a beautiful site for watching the sunset. My boys loved it and want to go back. | Camp Tiny was a great place to park our RV right on Hwy 7 . We were able to hike at Sam’s Throne, Alum Cove Natural Bridge & we were able to get to Fern Falls from the Camp.  If you are wanting a clean safe spot to camp while you explore this area, Camp Tiny is a good spot. A scenic drive to Jasper for a few restaurants, & grocery store was nice! | We had a group of four and stopped here on the way from NC to Arkansas .... Clean , established campsites with terrific views. Sunset was spectacular with an added view of a twinkling Nashville skyline .  Would definitely look to stay here again on future trips .  Google maps was spot on. 
Michael was a terrific host . We had the pleasure of meeting him and it was a treat to hear some of his adventures as well. | My boyfriend and I love to travel, but we never plan where we go/camp. We’ve always been the last minute kind of people. We love that we can pull the app up and find secluded or family, friendly stays! Easy to use, and always are go to. | Highly recommend this peaceful spot for stay over! Tamara responded to my questions quickly & helped me get situat d
Most grateful! I’ll be back | We camp on the East Coast. Finding a campsite in a park can be difficult, especially on weekends. Using Hipcamp, we have stayed at a variety of places when campgrounds were full. Each experience was excellent. We use hipcamp as our go-to when planning new trips. You won’t be disappointed. | Enjoyed the park, and the camping area was nice and clean. Inside of tent could of been cleaner, however the presentation was nice. Would do it again in the future and longer than one night. | I like the idea of this app but find it very frustrating when searching for a campsite there’s no option to see only those available. Even though you can put your date in, all the campsites show up and you have to slog your way through to find an open one on busy dates.
Plus, needs more photos & many more reviews by REAL users, not the professional photographers & influencers- ugh, totally not authentic opinions. | Highly recommend! 
A great way to make some extra cash. | So excited to use this app . For someone who lives in the city with an outdoor passion this is perfect. | Our first use of Hipcamp was with Pennylane Farm in Sorrento Fl. It was a great experience. Mark was very nice and made sure we had what we needed. The farm was beautiful and well maintained. They have two horses that would occasionally come by to visit.   We weren’t sure what to expect camping on someone’s property but after one day, we wanted to stay longer. Unfortunately it was already booked but we will be back to Pennyland Farm. | We found the Collins Family Farm while looking for a RV site for the weekend.  I can’t begin to explain how pleasantly surprised we were.  The hosts communication about the farm as well as local amenities was superb.  Very accommodating and informative.  This place is amazing. From the cute goats, horse, chickens, pigs and “Edwardo” the turkey.  We never longed for animal companionship. On our first night we were met by what I would call the  Collins Family Farm mascot “Cheeta Collins” the most friendly 4 legged feline I’ve come across. He met our dog Kane  and after a few games of tag I truly believe they are life long friends it’s truly a unique and beautiful getaway.  We were so 
Impressed we booked for the following weekend to bring the entire family.  A true gem. | I love hosting hipcampers and always enjoy being able to visit with them and help them have a great experience! | Lisa was a fantastic host. She brought us farm fresh eggs from her neighbor’s chickens. We met her Cutting Horse Flacca and Lisa showed us what a Cutting Horse does. Great, quiet, safe stay. We will be back. | We were able to hang up 3 hammocks and put up a Coleman 4 person tent under the covered portion of this structure. First night we had so much rain and the second night dropped into the 30’s. We put up tapestries and tarps to help with the wind and rain and had a propane heater so we didn’t freeze. The porta-potty was fine to use. 

Lots of twigs and logs around the property for a fire. 

Jesse was a great communicator! We plan on coming back. | Easy to use and seems to have many places all over the country. | I am new to Hipcamp, but so far…GREAT EXPERIENCE! My first host camp is awesome! I highly recommend it to anyone in Sandy, OR area! | I have most of the camp site apps and HipCamp is the ONLY one that delivers every. Single. Time. I’ve had some amazing solo trips and even better, some great memory building trips with my kids. The variety of sites allow me to select how “rough”I want to rough it and there is ALWAYS one in my price range. Really happy I found this app and am able to expose my kids to the great outdoors. | Very simple, easy way to earn cash from your property! | Verizon | Exceptionally beautiful with grand oaks covered in Spanish moss.  Super quiet.  Occasional moo from local cows and a flock of chickens that pass by from time to time.  Clean, organized and with a great host who answers any questions quickly. | Spur of the moment spontaneous adventure- my wife and I found Hickory Nut Point Friday afternoon about 3:00 on Hipcamp. We decided to make the short 40 minute drive. We were greeted by Cameron who graciously gave us a tour of his great property. We camp out of a Jeep Wrangler, so we set up camp, ate dinner while admiring the great view of the lake. It was a nice cool, quiet and peaceful night. This morning we Caught an amazing sunrise over the lake while eating breakfast. We reluctantly broke camp and headed back to the “real world”. Cameron and Rochelle were great host. We’ll be back!!
Thank you,
Stephen and Sherri | It was a very pleasant stay, Tammy was a very good host! I felt very comfortable. The area is so beautiful. The campsite is very well maintained, the bathrooms are in perfect condition and really new. I would definitely return to this place! | Hipcamp is an ingenious way to connect people together and help us bond through a mutual respect and love of the outdoors! Had so much fun at Casita in the Hills Ranch down in Texas!!!! Will definitely book more trips!!!! | I am always amazed by the unique options for camping and glamping across the country.

Try out our most advanced ""search along the route"" that makes millions of hidden gems visible for you in seconds. This tool is perfect for road trip fans, car travelers, RVer... and anyone who wants to experience more.

BEFORE THE TRIP: BUILD YOUR ROUTE
Explore routes of several 100 kilometers in no time. Enter your starting point and destination and be surprised how many interesting stops await you along the way.

PLACES OFF THE BEATEN PATH 
Discover hidden sights, cafés or accommodations, that only few tourists know about - most of them only a few minutes away from the highway. We've already unlocked millions of places for you in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Denmark. (Coming soon to all of Europe.)

FILTER BY TRAVEL TIME
We show you not only where a detour is worthwhile, but also how much time you need for the detour. You can filter stops by actual travel time (e.g. max. 10 minutes drive).

FOR FAMILIES WHO LOVE TO TRAVEL
While travelling with kids, you'll take many breaks. Instead of a rest stop at a service station - how about an adventure playground or a picnic with a view? by the ways shows you family-friendly stops that are often only 5 minutes away from your route.

ALSO WORKS WITH GOOGLE MAPS & CO.
Once you have found a stop, send the location to your favourite navigation tool - with just one click. And off you go on your adventure.

A few improvements though. First, when you search for places for your plan, the result doesn’t narrow down to your destination. Instead, it will display all the places with similar names in the entire world. When I plan for my trip to Paris, why would I want to see places in Australia and Canada?

Second, management of sub groups within a trip would be great. For example, allow creating trip to Paris and Berlin and Rome under a larger plan called Trip to Europe. And then allow forwarding of reservation emails to the Trip to Europe plan for automatic imports. Thanks. | Would love to see the document section incorporate actual word and excel documents...odd that it doesn’t support that.

Notifications could be more specific...pretty generic at the moment.

Would love to see hiking/camping trips incorporated, to include camp sites.

Great App! Keep building it and improving! | Great idea. But everything is based on where you’re going rather than the chronological order in which you seeing/doing everything.

It does not include information for county roads or city streets.

Features:
- Zoomable and mobile-friendly map display
- Traffic speeds and road conditions
- Real-time updates on road maintenance, construction, restrictions and road closures
- Camera images and live streaming video
- Trucker mode with resources specific to commercial motor vehicle operators
- Winter weather conditions (seasonal)
- Plow tracker
- Hands-free, eyes-free feature to announce upcoming road conditions that will impact your route

Drop the Distraction
The primary responsibility of every driver is the safe operation of their vehicle. While traveling, mobile communication devices should be used only when the motor vehicle is at a complete stop off the traveled portion of the roadway. Do not text and drive (it's against the law) or use this app while driving. For more information about distracted driving in Colorado and safety tips, visit https://distracted.codot.gov.

The app doesn’t seem to be updating but you can’t tell for sure because the information isn’t tied to a specific time. | Worthless app and data.  Don't bother.  The August review called 2 levels of terrible nails it | This is a useful tool, but a very clunky app to use. Favorites do not seem to work. There is a favorites button present in certain views, but pressing it doesn’t do anything. When I look for a route from Denver to Winter Park, it is currently routing me through Silverthorne and Kremmling. But it shows Berthoud pass is open. This makes no sense because it adds about two hours to my trip. This is obviously a contradictory result. I will generally use this only in conjunction with Google Maps and other sources. CDot warns against using any alternate routing app, but theirs is not ready for prime time. | The colors chosen are too close in shade to make the map meaningful. All bland earth tones. No red or yellow or green usually associated with road conditions. An existing closure (I-70) is not even shown as such. | The go to app for trucking through Colorado | Again the app lets us down.  Big storm in Denver, and the host has frozen.  Now I know that castlerockits handles more states thsn just Colorado.  Weather today is not a nationwide event, and Colorado is not a large population state.  Castlerockits should be able to handle this. CDOT, if you read this, find another vendor or bring it in house.

Don
March 14, 2024 | Come on, you can do better. I click on the I-70 on ramp at red rocks and you have a system failure. Come on, this is easy to fix. | The color scheme designating the road conditions is too difficult to discern. I miss the written list of warnings and restrictions. | When incidents occur they don’t get uploaded to the app soon enough. Closures of Loveland Pass and tunnel metering at Eisenhower should be posted as alerts. | This app should come up on your cars view screen like Apple Maps. So you can see how road conditions are as you travel. That would be very helpful. Too many things that are not important to choose from. And not very good when looking at conditions outside Denver area. | I think the rest of the negative reviews have said it all.  Hope cdot creates a simpler more user friendly app. | Not at all user friendly. Tips on how to sign up have no relevancy to present site | One can view roadways through out Colorado. I am uncertain what people expect but this site is pretty darn cool. I use it to preview road conditions, accidents and other highway issues as I travel or as the site says when I am planning a trip in Colorado. One can actually traffic conditions and if there are stoppages from all sorts of issues. Makes one realize the government can view you just about anywhere in Colorado on public roads. | Terrible app.   Impossible to navigate , information is not current.  Better to use google maps, Apple Maps or Waze | At a road closure and COtrip app isn’t updated to reflect that yet. 

Can’t depend on a site that doesn’t have real-time information posted. | Not sure I have ever utilized a more unhelpful app. Actually quite impressive that CDOT can make such a useless platform. The map interface is worthless, route feature is impossible to navigate, and updates are buried away. 0/5 don’t recommend. | how do i get my phone number back if someone else registered it? | Terrible web support | What happened to the cameras an hwy133 around mile marker 26 and 43 | This app has everything you need to know for planning your Skis trip | The user interface on this is terrible. | Overall i have been happy with this app. But with recent update, The route function no longer works (can’t search for end point). Since this is how i mostly used app, it’s much less useful now. Please fix. | Took what was a useful App for mountain corridor travel and made a useless App. Whoever made all these changes is fleecing the state by drastically complicating what worked into a mess. | The app has no functionality to give current road updates.  Had to use isvailpassopen.com to actually get road info.  Even 511 is total crap now.  That’s wrong with this govt org, have you tried to use this app when driving? It’s awful!!! | The app is very complicated to use when you need it most for road closures | I like selecting the camera layer and then setting directions to see all the cameras along the route.  I also like the road conditions overlay. | Why don’t app developers use a little everyday common sense? | We love this app, and use it all the time! It only has one MAJOR thank you flaw! The colors on the map for road conditions are to close, and therefore, are very hard to distinguish, especially for those with vision issues. Please fix this and choose bright colors that are very different from each other for each of the road conditions. If that is done, this app immediately becomes a 5 Star App! Until then, it gets a three… Barely! | Quick and easy access to road conditions and rest areas. We will be using this to get across Colorado with a group of campers. Should be a fun trip. | The decision to make this a “planner” which focuses on driving directions was a horrible one.  Google Maps and Waze, as well as proprietary car makers’ in-car mapping work superbly.  So why recreate the wheel with this one?  COTrip worked superbly as an indicator of road conditions (verifiable with the cameras and now eliminated video cams) for Colorado residents/voters who know how to get where they are going.  You could easily check what your drive was going to be like and plan alternate routing (or delay your trip) if traffic was heavy or conditions were dangerous.

Now, with 75% of the screen taken up with useless top, bottom and side bars and icons, the map is tiny, and cameras (only still) hard to access.

Conditions and traffic are not updated in real time, which is especially frustrating when ColoradoDOT Twitter feed is also rarely updated.

All in all, a horrible re-do of the app. | There are two levels of terrible here. One is the app itself. The user interface designers made inexplicable choices. More importantly, CDOT’s data flow into this system makes the app mostly worthless. The timeliness, quality, and quantity of information CDOT feeds into the system of their lit road information signs, website, and app means that even a finely polished app would be useless. I get it. It’s challenging. CDOT is one thing, local dispatch another, reality on the ground yet a third. But CDOT is mostly useful as an agency for awarding various contracts (including to make an app). The actual value added by, say, having employees who can use their creativity and skills to integrate these data streams better to make CDOT’s road information system better, is close to 0. Don’t worry – CDOT can award a contract for that (to someone who doesn’t really get it). | Easier to use than the mobile website because at least the map area is a little bigger. But still doesn’t help me understand what’s going on with the huge traffic jam on I70 (and if it is being cleared or what). I tried looking at the cameras, I can see a map with little camera icons but when I tap them nothing happens. I guess I can use the arrows on the camera picture to switch to different cameras but I can’t make sense of where they are on the map so I don’t know what I’m looking at. | This is a very unintuitive app. I use a lot of software programs, and this one is very difficult to use. For example, the time calculation is stuck on walking. I cannot find a place in the iPad app to change it to driving. The program needs a menu to change options and settings. | Google maps is even better.  Sat in several gridlocks along I70 where google maps shows accident.  This says nothing.  Only good thing is the cameras.  Which obviously this app doesn’t look at. | US 6 Loveland pass sometimes shown closed when it is not and usually shown open when the road is closed.
Difficulty navigating the app means the only thing it is good for is looking at the cameras - when they work and are clean enough to show road conditions.
It’s a bad app that replaced a useful app. The old app indicated travel times between various points and was easier to use.
The current iteration is just user vicious and annoying. | … lime green font color for cities, considered readability color contrast, I’ll rate this app higher. | What good is an app if you have to log in each time you use it? | Great app. Has lots of layers can add cameras to see the road conditions, accidents etc. Good app for driving in winter. Says in Apple App Store no data collected. | Either using this app wrong or it does not seem to be very accurate or delayed in getting accurate information. Tried using several times and always the same experience. | Road closures, restrictions, snow plow locator, much more, very helpful. | Information not timely and app logs you out.   Ui is just not any good | I haven’t had to use COtrip.org since last ski season, and I discovered the new app version, but both are completely useless with this redesign. When we were driving from Golden to Frisco last night, the drive times were extremely long on Google maps, but your info said only “heavy traffic” and “poor conditions.” What was not evident was that Hwy 6 over Loveland Pass was closed, forcing delays through the tunnel with all the hazmat trucks backed up. All I could see was your confusing map with various colors and circles. I could tell Loveland Pass was closed, and I figured that was the issue, but I had to discern all this with no context. I wanted to find a description of I-70 with written information.How on earth could you have moved to such a cumbersome system? Look at all these reviews over the past year, and return to functionality, please! | As a trucker this is exactly what we’re looking for | How about a simple non-graphical interface that can be used with one finger that lets you see what’s coming on your route.

Also, there is no reason to for this sort of app to need a login.  

Years ago this app was great and I used it all the time. | Difficult to use, crashes, functions don’t work | How do you have cameras but they don’t work , what’s the point of having them. They have not worked for 4 days now and nobody has done anything. This is at least for the cameras across all of I-70 none of them work and this is for safety, so I guess y’all want people to just guess at the road conditions and then cause more accidents and y’all don’t care if people get hurt or injured or even worse. | Traveling over Christmas and count on the cameras. And they are not working. | What’s the point of this when none of the cameras are operational? I haven’t had one produce an image or video for a month or more now.

It’ll make you drive the complete opposite way just to turn you around and go back. | If you’re going to force people to pay $20 to use an effective google maps routing add-on, you shouldn’t use google maps and it’s incredibly incorrect plot points and directions. Please stop having me turn left on roads that I’m not allowed or able to turn left on. Please stop having me go 4-10 minutes out of my way to TURN AROUND when I could just TURN AROUND ON THE STREET I’M ON. Please stop bringing me to destinations that don’t even exist. If you’re going to continue having these massive flaws in the extremely simplistic function of ROUTING then you should not be charging the insane price of $20 a month. Why would I pay a monthly fee for something that does not work? | I did a 7 day trial and canceled but was still being charged. The money didn’t come out of my back though because my card was locked. But I’m still being forced to pay because I can’t download load any in-purchase app until I pay. I sent several emails but yet to receive a call or email. Apple is no help either. | Somebody downloaded this app on my phone and they somehow charged me $20 per month for over a year …. This should be illegal. | All it does is have you back track. You better off making your own route with a Thomas guide don’t waste your money | Takes me to the nearest drop off location everytime ! | Love this app!! For me, WELL worth the costs.  But I drive for a living and need to map my routes. Invaluable tool for me. Great product. | Such a helpful app and really useful. Too bad it cost $20. I think $10-15 is more reasonable seeing as it just gets sent to your favorite map app like Apple Maps or google. Gotta keep switching back and forth. | It helps me save so much time. It puts all my routes in order and gives me the fastest way to go. It lets me know how much time I’m gonna take doing all my orders. | Nice app.. | This saves so much time for errands and deliveries.  Love it | Hands down best routing app on the market.    Always save at least 2 hours minimum every day.   Highly recommended | Awesome site | *update* I don’t know if I missed it previously, but not too long after I sprite my review, the “restart route” option was there! If I missed it, oops, if it was added per request, thank you! 
One more option that would be useful would be to be able to reorganize stop numbers after optimization. I deliver to a couple apartment complexes and small neighborhoods and I am often passing by streets with later stops or in the apartments I pass by a stop right at the entrance then it takes me to the back of the complex and the first stop ends up being the last in the complex, so not very chronological location wise. Great work on the app otherwise! It is extremely helpful for my route! 

I just started a newspaper delivery route for my local paper. They have an antiquated system of following a route sheet (turn by turn directions on a paper) to complete about 130 stops. It was terrible since I had to use it for training, and it’s frankly quite dangerous to keep looking at a paper, keep your place, have a light on in the vehicle and drive at the same time between the hours of 1am-4am. After sampling a couple other apps, I landed on this one. I had a near flawless experience, couple hiccups, but overall great. My only wish/suggestion would be adding a function to restart a route after you complete it. My routes are the same Monday - Wednesday so would be nice to just use the same route multiple times instead of having to copy to a new one. Other than that, it is well worth the $19.99/mo which helps me drive less distracted and helps me knock off about an hour of my 3.5 hour route. | Great app love it | Muy fácil de usar y muy eficiente | This app has doubled my daily production. Very thankful for the app and its low cost. | Concise, to the point, and fast! | The app forces the user to “re-optimize” when restarting a route. That’s problematic. The user may prefer a strict route plan. Not a “re-optimized” route. There should be more control on the user’s end. There should also be a feature where the user can drag and rearrange stops. The app won’t allow it. Needs to be improved. | HOWWWW did I ever make any deliveries without this app!?!   10/10 recommend!! | Excelent | I have tried at least one other app - and this is by far the best and most user friendly! It is now my absolute go to for multiple deliveries | Seriously love this app | I am delivering flowers for Valentine’s Day and used circuit to help me navigate the quickest path. And it did NOT fail me. This app is the freaking BOMB! 

It’s $20 and my deliveries are only $8 a piece so I had to make a sacrifice and pay for it anyways but it rly is worth it. | This app really helps drivers plan and execute a good route. Time saver for sure! | I use this app for work! And the fact that i can use this app and still beat the time posted just makes me feel smarter then a computer and satélites combined! | Work perfectly for what I need it for and helps me maximize my efficiency | Mostly a great time saver. I deliver for USPS and their routing system seems to back track A LOT.. There are times where this one does too but it is usually minimal and the map and GPS still works when google doesn’t so you can keep going even if service drops you just have to be careful. 
Only recommend is that it would keep track of the number of packages for each stop when you scan them in. It would be nice to have a pop up that says ex. “3 packages for this stop” | The best | Put in the addresses along with start and finish points and let the app make the most efficient route.  
One less thing to worry about. | I am a package delivery driver for one of the big package delivery companies in USA. I routinely deliver 100+ packages every day, and this route planner has saved me on average 1 hour each day. I simply plug in all my stops, click optimize route, and it makes my day so much easier. | I repair appliances and I use this to arrange my routes in the most efficient way possible. The ability to put in time frames makes this app indispensable. | Nice app | Good app no complaints just uh leave a comment nd they’ll fix it to what suits you | Amazing route planer, saving time, and money | Great product | The best route application. | Love it, helps me save alot of time | Would be a 5 star if I could use this app on Apple CarPlay instead of pulling my phone out to click next stop but it’s an awesome app! | I’ve been using this over a year and it helped me a lot saving time and gas 
I am very happy with it and recommend everyone how deliver to download it and start using it 
So thanks a lot 
Greetings | Great | I deliver food for a local food kitchen once or twice a month.   This is a great tool to maximize efficiency.  Love it! | I make deliveries as a hospice volunteer, and this has made my task much easier- great app! | It gets you where you need to be! | Loved the notes feature | Should have discounts for medical couriers | I really like using this app. It makes my day go just a little bit smoother.

My second search a few minutes later showed me prices had increased by $30. It would not show me the car I saved. | Momondo used to be really nice, but now they have opened to scammers like Ovago and Gurufare.

I have signaled it to them bot no reaction so far. | It doesn’t show only published fares directly from the airlines even if you select that option in the settings.  This app works on deception to the end user at all levels who do not understand how to legitimately book travel.  Avoid at all costs and book direct instead. | Best website/app to search for your flights | install this cheap free app now!!! literally it made traveling 100x easier!!! | Best deals of tickets | I have like this app for several years, ever since I heard about it, I’ve been able to search numerous fly to numerous states in numerous countries, always leave me in the right direction | I absolutely love the Momondo app! It's a fantastic tool for organizing trips and finding cheap flights. The user-friendly interface makes it a breeze to search for and compare flight options. The app's ability to provide a wide range of flight choices, along with helpful filters, ensures that I always get the best deals. Plus, the price alert feature is a game-changer, helping me snag those unbeatable fares. Momondo has become my go-to travel companion, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone looking to plan their next adventure! | I love this app. It gives good results for every search I conduct. The fact that I can track flights makes this app even super. Will recommend it to all interested in traveling. | Ok chất lượng | Algo bueno siempre tiene margen de mejora. | Very good | Perfect 🤩 | Very good | Searching all those sites at once is really powerful and helpful! | This search engine has great options and comprehensive listing of fares and itineraries. Excellent filters too. Very good if you need to search for for mildly complicated transoceanic routes. | As someone who has been a pro at shopping best deals for flights for years, momondo is hands down the best app for the job. | With iPhone 13 app doesn’t work | I’ve loved the speed and ease of this app, but recently realized I need to be more vigilant about where it is sending you for the deals. 

Searched for flights, and upon selecting one we liked, was redirected to a different site, “Flights Mojo.” If this happens to you, DO NOT purchase a flight from Flights Mojo, they are absolutely a scam company. After completing our reservation, we received an email that it was not complete until we called them. The number took us to a call center abroad where we are  informed that the flights we reserved are not available, and then the operator tried to extract more money for completely different flights through completely different cities. It was *extremely* difficult to leave the call with any assurances that we weren’t being charged, and we are still really worried about having given them credit card info. Other reviews of Flights Mojo online have nightmare stories about reservations cancelled and no refunds issued, demands for more and more fees as well as photos of identification and credit cards to be sent. Lots of people left high and dry when they try to use tickets. 
I have no idea if Momondo does any vetting for where it sends you with searches, but please be aware that in this instance they’re allowing a very sketchy company to solicit your financial information. | I have been looking at multiple airlines who fly to me requested destination and This app is only showing one option. Totally not correct | Tried to book flights three times and they changed the fees every time baiting me for more lonely- total SCAM | Unfortunately, momondo has no protection for its users from booking tickets with scam like travel agencies like edreams, etc. If this platform kept allowing these companies to lure customers into their scam like businesses operation, it’s basically a culprit. 

##For other users, please be careful for the third party booking websites momondo is directing you to, some may never refund your money even when promised. Read online for honest customer reviews before paying or book directly with the airline. | Really good in searching for cheap prices and it’s my go-to app for almost all my travel expenses | Wether it’s a room or a flight you’re looking for, I’ve found, by far, the cheapest and yet high quality places and airlines through this app. | Excellent | I’ve bought 2 plane tickets now using momondo and compared to the experience using other services e.g. KAYAK, momondo seems to have all the upsides and none of the downsides. The search API is responsive, searches don’t take terribly long (~1min), prices are legit and low, and the purchase pipeline is simple and streamlined. Only thing I don’t like is the purple background lol. All this, for free, is indicative of serious focus on quality. Nice job on this app guys | This by far the best app to me and this is just my own opinion someone else might have a different opinion but to me I like the way it’s set up in terms of breaking down time schedules and prices when you looking for hotels or flights no matter your destination been using for yrs it works for me | The best I have been able to find. Better than kayak, Google flights or skiplagged | Love this app | This use to be a great app until they started to send me massive spam about tickets prices I've been searching for (without asking me). Also, I've started to receive spam from some airlines from which I've blocked tickets trough Momondo app and I think they sell our email address. I'm moving to another app. | Monjurul Islam | The app provides convenience to track flight prices but even after setting up the price alerts , it never notify me if the prices have increased or decreased. | Brings the best prices as always. You just have to be careful with the websites that you completeyour booking from. | I love using momondo to book my trips however I don’t appreciate multiple sites asking for my personal information like my passport number & Identification card info ; I have book with airlines and they never asked me for these personal information; now I’m thinking twice to use momondo to book any trip kiwi was one of the sites who asked for my info when I called them they said it’s the airline so I called the airline and they said that it’s not them it’s the site kiwi policy … thanks momondo | Listen!! I love to travel and this is my favorite app to check flight prices! Amass The cheapest and updated you on flights if goes lower | I’ve been using momondo since 2016 that’s 5 year so ago and from the beginning I’ve had a love affair with it. User friendly and updates keep getting better. And couple of years I told my brother about it as the only choice for flight or Internatinal flights etc. Yesterday I referred my cousin to it. And I referred many others to the best online flight and hotel search engine Momondo has been my travel companion. ❤️ | I totally understand but this is so stupid for the application to delete all flights to Russia or from it!!!! | Very good Ap for a long time until now. I was Directed to purchase tickets at Fare Bubble and thought I booked a flight but it was a scam website. Had to cancel my credit card that I used.  This is unacceptable and disappointing that Momondo allows this type of partner on the Ap. Buyer beware. | I have been using the app for years and have booked all my vacation during that duration using this app! The prices are not too good to be true they are legit! | Just like the title i bought insurance the rental company did not recognize and i had to buy a completely different insurance. Don't get car insurance until you pick up the car. Otherwise momondo can be good at saving about ten$ per flight reservation. | This side is like the magic genie you wish you always had to tell you all the different flights and times and you can sort by anything and you do NOT NOT have to go through any shenanigans. It takes you directly to the airlines booking site. No shenanigans. | I bought tickets yesterday, I did the payment and received the confirmation from Oojo, today they called me and saying that I have to pay $1K more. No body is here to solve the problem. Just Scam | Very effective website to get some very good flights. Pay attention to the total time involved. | I’ve been waiting for 2 weeks to get my eticket still haven’t got it have to go to Florida in a week they say they misspelled my name and you can hardly understand the operators there very dissatisfied and hoping I can get my tickets since I took off work | YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME, THANK YOU ! | I love this app but recently stopped using because when I try clicking on Anywhere it does not do anything. Usually it pre-populated the “to” field but it’s not doing that. | I need contact info. No numbers for them or the third party agent. I need to change my flight and I’m within the 24 hours. The third party is Travelgenio and I am seeing they have one star on Yelp. Why would you use them momondo?  Horrible. | The website allowed “fare bubble” to post flight search results. The company is an absolute scam. They don’t answer their phone, email is bounce back, and IM has nobody on the other end.

**Now with a vacation countdown timer included for free!**

Pack This will be your go-to app to prep for those upcoming getaways, whether big or small. Easily categorize and itemize everything you and the rest of the crew need to do and bring along for every adventure. 

Simply set up your trip dates, who’s going with you, and start building your Pack This lists…

Categorize lists the way YOU want to. We won’t overwhelm you with pre-populated headings and items you don’t need or care about. And once you’ve built one list, we’ve made it easy to duplicate and modify it for similar trips in the future. 

We know planning often gets spearheaded by one “lucky” person in the group. If you are that special someone (and we think you are if your reading this!), adding fellow travelers and tagging them for each task makes your life a whole lot simpler. When your list is complete, email it to each of your travel mates so there’s no confusion on who’s supposed to bring what. 

We didn’t stop there…

Here are a couple of other features we think you’ll love:
* Trip countdown clock that keeps a tally of how many days  until you take off 
* Real-time weather updates (which will make sure you don’t forget an umbrella or a sweater) 

Be the ultimate leader of the pack with Pack This!

P.S. We live for your feedback and would love to hear how you like Pack This. Please leave us a review on the App Store and tell us how we’re doing, what you love, and what you’d like to see.

So I get hung up every time I want to add something and then it tells me I have to go back and type something first. to help with this confusion. Make that add button disabled until something is typed in the text field.

Also, it would be nice to add multiples of the same object. For example, when I’m packing for a trip that is seven days, I would rather add “socks“ and then dial up a counter to seven. Rather than adding socks seven times, or having to type “seven pairs of socks”. | The apps great. Very easy to use and I like the countdown. I only wish you could do multiple destinations for one trip, like when you go on a cruise. Other than that I’m really liking the app. | This app is really good, it has a lot of great features but when I downloaded it I thought you could collaborate on this app and lists with other people that have also downloaded this app. I bought the pro version and also bought it for another person thinking we could both add to the list and each see what each other had added and packed. I was sad to realize that is not a feature on this app. That was pretty much the big deciding  factor of downloading and upgrading this app. This would be a great feature for you to add. | In general, I like this app. I love that it has the trip countdown. I also really like that sharing a list does not require people to have the app. (That feature helps with my 80-year old technology challenged Mom!)

That being said, for me to get rid of paper & provide a 5-star review, there are a few things I would like to see:
- ability to sync across devices so I can fill in a Master List on a larger screen. 
- ability to share the list and have it dynamically updated by others. (Shared in real time)
- the ability to share the list and add a “due date” to make sure that something is packed. (I can enter “10 days before trip” and it calculates that for me would be a bonus!)
- the ability to create a sublist for organization. So I could create a master list item of “carryon”, a sublist item of “essential medications” then add the medications that I need to pack. Or I could pack a “car”, “backseat” etc. 

it helps to be visual in not only what you want to pack but how to arrange the packing. 

That would allow me to eliminate paper!
Thanks for reading!! | Really wanted this to work. | List does not display | Items I add to list not showing up. In app contact support button not working. Can’t upload profile picture from phone gallery. | I could add lists but the items I added to each list wouldn’t populate or show. Don’t waste your time downloading this. | I used this for a trip, found easy to use and liked. HOWEVER, now I am trying to use it for a different trip and modify it, and I cannot figure out how to transfer my previous trip into the new one without typing it all again.  Fix this or explain how to do it and it is really great. | It’s and iPad App that does not support landscape orientation… make keyboard entry cumbersome at best. In the Trash Can for me… | I’m Using this for a trip coming up, it super helpful | It would be cool to have categorized suggestions list and also a quantity count per item | They advertise it as if you can share lists with other users. My partner and I both paid for pro only to find that you can just email someone a static list, you can’t interactively share and update lists together. “Sharing lists” actually turns out to be the same thing as if you sent your travel buddy a screenshot of your list. It’s basically useless because of that. Everything else it does you can do for free in a phone note, except those are better because you actually can share and update a phone note together with someone! | Great except it only lets you make lists for 2 trips.  Then it tries to charge you. | I thought this would be super great at first, and it was, until I realized that you have to subscribe to have more than 2 trips at a time! What the heck! And now that I’ve been logged into my account due to getting a new phone, there’s no way to log back into the account and I’m not making a whole new account that doesn’t have my 2 previous trips! | I have used this app to get ready for all of my trips and it has been a
Great help specially to get my baby bag ready for the delivery of my baby! Lots of help and very useful to keep organized 100%! | Great app!  Purchased a few travel apps and this is by far my favorite!!  Upgrading to pro was such a great deal and I love it!  Keeps me very organized and so easy to use!! | I upgraded my iPhone and my saved trips are now gone. Now I have to start all over. Or get a new app. There appears to be no way to recover. The settings has nothing but updating a profile picture. | Bad UI, really useless app. You can use any collaborative doc or list maker; doesn’t have any unique features. Deleted quickly. | Unlike other apps it won’t generate a list or even suggestions for you, so you’re inputting the items and categories yourself. So you get a more custom experience but you have to put in the up front work. I’m giving it three stars because of that and it acts like it can email a list but nothing happens when you try to click to email (buggy?). Perhaps the pro version is better? I’m still mourning and trying to replace Wunderlist | I purchased pro to add other travelers and email list to them and it doesn’t recognize that I upgraded nor can I email. I was able to add additional travelers but can do nothing else. | Was hoping it would auto populate a basic packing list I could then add to. Also would be a lot more helpful to be able to cross of the lists for every traveler individually as I pack them. That was what I was needing to make sure I don’t forget items for 3 kids. I paid extra to add travelers and they don’t even get their own lists. I feel ripped off. | This app is helpful but ultimately disappointing. I will say it’s nice to be able to make multiple lists under different categories under the same vacation. 
However, once categories are created, you cannot adjust the order they show in. If you select for a list to sow alphabetically, it automatically crushed back after you choose the app.  Also you cannot change the color scheme. I paid to go pro in hopes these things would change, but no such luck. Like the toddler says, this app is useful, but underwhelming and fell short of expectations. | This app doesn’t work well at all | I love that I have the flexibility to create the categories & lists as I feel fit for each trip! I’ve used it for 2 trips with a list for me and another for my dog! I would also like to see the capability of changing the order of my categories once I’ve completed them! 

An improvement I’d like to see is my having access to the app/lists on my iPad and my iPhone!! My phone is convenient as it’s always with me for updating on the go. My iPad is much easier in creating initial list and while packing due to size of screen!!! Maybe a logon that will recognize and share our lists on both?

Thank you!
Marsi | When you open the app and type your name, the first screen that pops up appears to be an add. I made the mistake of clicking g on the “no more adds” thinking that would remove the pop up. Instead it charged my visa (2 x). Again, not sure if it’s designed to be deceptive, but it sure tricked me first thing in the morning. | I downloaded about five packing apps and this was by far the best. I didn’t need a bunch of pre-populated items suggested for me to pack (birth control pills, really?) — I just wanted a clean space where I could make a few categories for the activities I’d be doing on my trip and the items I would need to pack for them & a way to check them off. I love that you can assign yourself or someone else to pack the item and while I haven’t shared a list yet, I know I will as I plan future summer camping trips. I’ve just used the app for one trip so far, but I travel often & I will definitely be paying for the upgrade to show my appreciation! One question I ran into — is it possible to rearrange the order of your categories once you’ve typed them in? I have found that I can alphabetize my items in each category, but haven’t seen a way to move around the categories. It would be a great feature to be able to drag and drop the categories in an order that makes sense to you— for example, if I have a category for each activity I am going to do on an adventure type trip, I would list them in the order they would be happening. (This helps me see what has already been packed for a previous day and what needs to be added for the next.) Thank you!! | I have found the app very useful. I love that I can copy lists from trip to trip and just make minor changes. It has also been useful to share the lists with other travelers. 

I would suggest one improvement. Please make it possible to reorder the categories within a list. | Don’t purchase | I love making lists, and this app lets me keep my list, and duplicate them for later trips.  If an item could moved from one category to another, then this app would be awesome. | The title says it all. | I can choose my own categories and add my own stuff, as detailed as “white linen swimsuit cover”, or as simple as “jacket”, as appropriate for that list. I can copy a trip,add travelers   (although honestly I only pack for myself so I can’t rate that feature). It has everything I need!

 I pack really lightly, perhaps not quite “minimalist”, but close, so there’s not a huge amount to list, but whatever’s in the list is pretty important and it’d be bad to forget. 

I’ve tried a number of others where the list is prepopulated, some even asked me to specify gender and included more crap on the packing list to carry - so it assumed because I’m female I must pack a lot of things I don’t need? I definitely don’t need to support that kind of design thought process! | After trying out a couple of different packing apps, this one is by far the best. I recently retired and have several trips planned ranging from one week domestic trips to 4 week international trips. In order for me to enjoy a trip stress free, I need to be organized . This app is great for that. I usually use a writing pad to list my packing list and to do items, but this is so much better. I upgraded. The $6.99 was worth the time of having to create a packing list for each trip. I created a master that I duplicate on all my trips then modify and add depending on the trip. | I hope yo see improvements but it’s a solid start | I travel sooooo much for so many different reasons and is stressful as heck and this app makes it soooo much simpler and easier I am only 11 but when I found this it was a game changer my whole family loves it and I speak for all of them when I say this app is awesome | What a great app. Very simple to use. Love it! ☺️ | I used to love this app but now that I’m trying to modify travelers in the settings the app crashes everytime!!! | IT CANNOT GET ANY BETTER | Description says you can “add fellow travelers”, which you cannot. You will pay $3.99 to add someone’s name, not to add their account to the list. This only works on one device. Would not have paid for it if I had known. | I really love this app. I have tried several apps and this one is the best one I’ve tried | So frustrated after having this app for just 45 seconds. I added my name and photo and then I had an ad pop up. No issue with the ad popping up. More upset that the “x” to close the app was behind my battery meter on the screen, a place that I can’t really touch on my phone. Needless to say I couldn’t get past the first ad. Closed the app and deleted it from my phone. Looks cool but didn’t get the chance to try it. | Buyer beware! This is not a shared dynamic database checklist with those traveling with you. This program allows you to assign tasks to other people and email them a static list. There is no ability for others to accept/reject the list, add items to the list, or mark as complete.  This is App is not as I had anticipated and has not accomplished my goal while still paying $7.  Think twice before buying.  Do you really want an App that offers little in the way of truly creating a dynamic method communication? | This is the best packing app ever!❤️ | This app is almost perfect. I upgraded to pro so that my husband could go on the app and see lists as well and add his stuff/things he could think of but that’s not available. Emailing the list is nice but not the same. Would love this feature! | Why did I buy this?  It crashes in both my iPhones. | I cannot go further until the dates for 2020 are fished in the calendar. | I love this app but it hasn’t been working for me for weeks and my checklist has been blank and I can’t see any of the items on there that I put down :((( & I fly out tomorrow and I had EVERYTHING on my list and now I can’t see it but it’s still there. I tried refreshing my phone and the app and even on WiFi it still doesn’t work. I’m sad :( | I love this app so much. I’m leaving for England in a week and was so worried I was going to forget what to bring. It has made me so much more confident that I will not forget anything. This is my favorite app and I will be using it all the time. I had a question about how to delete a trip. I decided to send them an email about my question. They got back with me so fast and helped me a lot. Thanks Ann that really helped. This is the best app ever!

Right exit - See which exit/entrance in subway you should go to.

Next departure - Showing current departure times for any chosen stop and line.

Favorite locations - Save your favorites to speed up future trip searches and view upcoming departures . These are available in the Apple Watch extension as well and enable you to look up departures directly from the Apple Watch.

 Traffic state  - Showing any disruptions or deviations affecting the public transport.

Reminder - Specify how many minutes before departure you want to be reminded, and the app will remind you either in the iPhone or in your Apple Watch (when the phone is in sleeping state).

Buy SL single ticket - For your chosen trip, the app can hand over zone information to simplify your ticket purchase from SL. Note: The app itself does not save the ticket, it only assists you to start the buying process correctly. 

Automatic language support for English and Swedish. Ability to change in settings.

Your response really didn’t help much. It was unclear and confusing. | Was getting route forecasts but quit downloading them. Now what. | I’m here, It doesn’t let me. | I am in the three day trial. When I have told it to subscribe and I currently have a subscription, every time I try to touch a button to either reroute or do something the box still pops up that says that I have to do something with the subscription. I can’t test anything or even look at anything in the app because all it does is keep annoying me to get a subscription even though I already have the subscription. While it looks like a really nice app that I would like to try I cannot even get it to function. You developers really need to test your stuff there’s something really wrong and if you can’t get your stuff working then there’s no reason why a person should pay you. | I wanted to like this app. Unfortunately, I do not and am choosing another. The app sends you to ads for its paid version even when you are trying to use aspects listed as free. It is very slow to load the route forecast, even though I am on strong WiFi. | The lite mode buffered for 5 min without giving me a forecast for a drive so I’m deleting. Doesn’t make me want to purchase anything from here. | Comparing the same route with other apps shows that their weather forecast is inconsistent. It would help to be transparent with where they get their data from to know if it’s accurate. Can’t find it anywhere in the app or the developer’s site. It’s concerning that the data does mot match other drive weather apps. | Very Helpful for planning a drive on highways to see weather. | They should be explaining their in-app purchase in description.

The OSM Maps are the best maps for offline (or online for that matter).  Guru's move to the macOS platform is a really nice addition - though I must admit I don't use it on my MacBook Air much as my iPadPro is much faster and I like the touch interface.  Overall, Guru is my go to offline/Navigation App. I do my long range travel planning in Furkot.com and Export my GPX data in Guru GPX format. Data management on Guru is straight forward and I haven't found any real limitations. With the Pro-version, I have 79GB of the worlds roads (maps) on my iPhone & iPadPro. Those maps update frequently at no additional cost. 

The only thing missing for me, feature wise, is Track Editing features. | After many km in the road with Guru( I’ve used other navigations apps before) this is THE best app. 
I get to see small backroads that I’ll never have found by myself. And I’m confident that I’ll not be taken to dead ends or anything impossible. 
Thanks a lot | Easy to import GPX files. I was able to navigate with Guru Maps Pro in the mountains of Ecuador. I use the app anyplace I might not have cellular service. 

I'm very happy that the app keeps improving and getting updated. A lot of features have been added over time. 

I use it less for recording, but the option is there.

A solid mapping and navigation tool. | Have tried them all, and this one is truly outstanding. | This program is by far the best program for navigation of offline mapping. Evgen is always improving the functions for faster access. Just added is Apple CarPlay which puts it above the competition. A few minor bugs are being worked on at the time of this review but believe me, they will probably be fixed before you download. I highly recommend this program for both vehicle and hiking. | the settings in the system settings app is gone. along with the “disallow cluster” settings. 
please bring it back!!! | 为啥账号不能互通会员？ | Best offline map app but please develop iWatch version. thanks you! | Would recommend. I use it for motorcycle trips where I am frequently out of cellular service. | I got this to use offline with only gps on trails where service doesn't exist. This has become so bloated with features that it has been less and less appealing and useful to me...now I have to provide an account to sync?! It's a shame since I've been using this for years and it's stable and polished... | Couldn't download any maps after 4th of July,now new update won't work on old IOS , disappointed, app served well for few years | So I caved in and created an Apple Sign in. However it will not sync my bookmarks from my iPhone (a running Guru Maps 4.10.2) that were synced to the cloud. So if you deleted your old version and sign in with this new version you lose your bookmarks!!

Please bring back an option for the old iCloud syncing!

Ver 5.0.1 iCloud Sync still hasn’t been added back (without having to sign in) for iOS devices. 

 Ver 5.0 Why can’t I still have access to my bookmarks I have previously synced with iCloud? Now I have to create an account in order to do this? No! This is not what I paid for. Please bring back the ability to sync via iCloud WITHOUT needing to have an account! Otherwise I would like a refund so I can go elsewhere. Thank you | I used this map program for years.
I love being able to track where I went and look at it later, and even save the data. We travel quite a bit, and use it on every trip, to help us get around, and to track our routes. Then it tells how far we traveled. Great for bike rides as well.
I started by using the Google maps while traveling, but have trouble getting it to fill in, and needed to find someplace with WiFi to fill in the details. Galileo let’s you download the maps you need and all the details are there.
I also really like being able to measure distance between two points on the map. I have organized a number of files that allows me to turn on and off points of interest, and past routs that I have traveled.
 Excellent map program, I’ll never travel without it. | I us the app in offline mode fishing in remote Canada. No fear of getting lost among the numerous islands and lookalike land features. | This app has exceptionally fast map redraw speed of its offline maps. Import of GPX files is easy and once they add Routing to Galileo (Guru) it will be a 5 Star App.

UPDATED:
Turn-by-turn was added and works flawlessly offline.  Did I mention the maps? They are the best map implementation of any mobile nav app - OSM or proprietary maps - and I've tried them all!

I travel the world and have the world's OSM maps on my phone - 69GB!!! With that much map data other nav apps crawl to a halt performance wise - not Guru. Of course most other map makers don't cover the whole world like OSM does. | 12/6/2021 the map needs some type of traffic notifications. Also, show map  in 3 D. 

12/4/2021 it would be nice if once a destination is calculated. The map would show several route alternatives. Presently, it only shows one. 11/24/2021 for the price one pays for the app. It should have better Lange guidance method. It should have a visual depiction of the lanes and what lane one should get in to exit 11/24/2021. For the price. It should have traffic notifications. | I downloaded the trial version and started downloading images while I had high speed internet. I just paid for the app, and ALL my images are gone, and I don’t have high speed internet now. How do I get my images from the original to the pro version? | Would not change a thing.
Make sure you save to the cloud! | Great app | I’ve had this app for several years and use it regularly to navigate where cell and WiFi are not readily available in places like Cuba, Ireland, hiking in the Great Smokey Mountains, etc.  

I especially like the ability to save locations in categories and control which POI’s are displayed on screen.  

Uses relatively small amount of storage for the detailed maps and routing. 

Does exactly as advertised! | Getting “error: 6  cannot resolve host name”. The default map is useless for navigation and points of interest. | This is a real navigator. You can daily trust and rely on. I use it on daily basis. One defect if you wanna call it a defect. Why Arabic language is not supported?  Really thanks for this amazing app. | Thanks for nothing. | This app represents separatists view on the borders, representing unrecognized, separatist territories as independent states.

This is purely russian view, as the rest of the world thinks that:

ABKHAZIA AND SAMACHABLO IS GEORGIA
CRIMEA IS UKRAINE
KARABAKH IS AZERBAIJAN

RUSSIA IS OCCUPANT!!! | I’ve used this while walking around London and while riding my motorcycle around the SW United States. Works well following saved tracks as on the COBDR or finding a route to a pub for a late lunch. | Please consider to add Arabic language in the next update | Holy crap again, did you see the response to my review? Shoulda woulda done this or that like its a problem with my phone not with the app! If the app is difficult to use it’s not the phone it’s the NAMELESS  PERSON WHO ANSWER THSES REVIEWS.Holy crap, have you seen SEPTEMBER 2 review, the developers answer to a complaint? ASK APPLE FOR A REFUNDI well heres my chance to get my monies back.upgraded to pro a long time ago, check in once in a while and its still not as practical nor  useful  to use as the Gmap. Whats the point of having tons of different maps if doing a simple “show me from here to here” takes longer than five minutes to figure out. | was a great app, but now you can’t import a gpx file anymore. App does not show on the share sheet. No answer from customer sipport/developer | Simply the best maps for hiking! Shows all the trails not just the official ones. The data is from open street map and Guru Maps adds a well polished interface. | I do winter hiking through the winter months, several times a week.  I go to places where it would be easy to get lost.  The app uses very little phone battery reserve and the combination of the comprehensive off line trail mapping with the satellite location feature is powerful in terms of knowing where I am located and what my options are for a great hike and getting back to the trailhead.  The “two-finger” distance measurement, while not crucial, is extremely useful and unique to navigation apps.

The documentation and organization feature of all past hikes is also extremely valuable in hike planning and sharing of its GPX record files.

I don’t leave home without Guru!!!
PapaJoe | Very helpful apps for record track as offline , | Love the features of the map and the ability to track the routes. As an avid rider I love seeing my stats for my run and this provides a great amount of detail. What’s lacking is the map seem to be pulled out of a paper map. The visual effect of google or apple maps is missing giving it an old feel to it. I have found myself more and more using rever for that reason alone as both apps do the same. However the graphic quality of rever is better. Would love to see better maps in the feature. Otherwise a great app. | This was my five star navigation app, then I upgraded to iOS 13 and can’t even load a gpx file into Guru now. Doesn’t show as a viable recipient of gpx files on the ‘share’ list. Help! | Dont know what happened to this App, used to work great now, worthless... unless its an address like restaurant or bar etc,,, wont allow you to navigate to the address. Sent 2 emails asking for support with no reply over a week ago. | Great until it simply stops tracking and doesn’t let you know it has. You could be going a long time without tracking as intended leaving big gaps in coverage. 

Very frustrating and damaging. 

Developers advised but offered no solution. | The first time I used this worthless app I put in a precise street address in Paris France. The app immediately put in a different address with the correct number but a different street. I tried to correct the error but it would not allow me to change the wrong address. What good is this app if it changes your address to another wrong address. What an expensive disappointment this is. One star rating because there is nothing lower. | Nice app.  Only wish it would work with apple CarPlay. | Very helpful to be able to navigate walking around Havana offline!! | I initially bought this for my Camino de Santiago walk but have been using it for every walk

Download the offline maps for the areas you will be...they enlarge up to incredible detail

What I love best is the GPS tracking of your walk.  You hit record at the beginning and turn it off when your done with your walk and you’ve got an accurate tracking of where you’ve walked with mileage, time walked, time idle and elevation changes 

It works completely without Wi-Fi or cell signal 

I can’t recommend it enough! | I based my entire website on this app. I love it. I’ve used it for years all ready. I recommend it | I’ve tried several map apps, and this is the best, no question. I just wish it would show as many local stores as Apple Maps in my area. | I have used it for several years. I live in the USA and travel a lot there and internationally, especially in China. Guru (Galileo) has never failed me.  I never use google, and rarely use apple maps.  My first look is always Guru. It even works to track your flight path when in airplane mode.  

I walk around foreign cities and countryside, never worried about network connection.  I tag my hotel, or friends home or bus/train station to maintain my orientation. If I find a great, tiny restaurant in an urban maze, tag it.  

Just download or update maps before you go and all is well. | Love this app, I first downloaded it because of work and then I moved away where services can be even worse. The great part about this app is you can pre download the map for the area and it works offline which is ideal especially if you’re not wanting to use data or unable to. Being able to pin things to find them again is great and the pins have different categories which is perfect for me. Hands down better then the other maps for these reasons. Google maps has some offline capabilities but it seems to not be as accurate. | A great app!! I suggest GPS filtering.  Evgen suggests accuracy filter 100 ft, distance threshold 20 ft.

The ascent and descent needs work. It needs filtering, because at present it adds in all the ups and downs of GPS data and gives you a figure that is at least double what it should be. | Have LOVED this app for years. The most recent update appears to have broken it. All maps deleted and no way to re-download them.

The maps are back! Hurray!!! So excited everything is working again because, as I said, I haves loved it for years. | I’ve used and loved this app for years. Normally I’d rate it 5 stars. However, the latest version started crashing instantly after I entered a search term. I’ve tried force closing and restarting my iPhone, but no luck. Please get this bug fixed! | App crashes when loading a map. Doesn’t last 10 seconds running. I want my money back | After some hours app is crashing and app can't use. IPhone 7 plus, ios 10.3.3 | Easy to learn/use. Great visuals. Really want to calculate routes in evening while online to use offline next day. Too bad. | I downloaded and paid for the app, downloaded all the states that I will be traveling and clicked the offline option.
I’m in my vehicle going to new locations constantly and you can Not put in an address even though you have the maps downloaded, you have to have internet so not offline at all unless you just want to watch yourself drive around real time which does nothing for me and probably most people.",4.74056,821,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bb/ca/be/bbcabeb7-ae14-d1a9-9464-77526558ea42/2b96a0ca-2332-451f-bd9e-995044952fd2_iPhone_8_Plus_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2f/06/bf/2f06bfe0-ee84-b852-a3d4-c1adde0c8848/07da6753-a97a-4da9-86c8-7d7859694dad_iPhone_8_Plus_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4d/73/c3/4d73c343-2937-d0e4-8ad2-0496b9249c9d/658136f2-6fa9-41c3-93a9-65d1f558c4fb_iPhone_8_Plus_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/68/3b/5f/683b5f6b-a5d6-c1d6-74e7-e05b86364c0a/1ef160db-711c-4e5a-83ce-c8b13f956cac_iPhone_8_Plus_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ab/5c/2e/ab5c2ee2-b9f6-4cbc-3970-877678941ef5/abb2e2db-aa7c-4e41-9d5d-ac67e23e0cba_iPhone_8_Plus_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/19/83/a3/1983a312-4b70-6e7a-535c-1536d43c3481/3a67752c-7c8d-4d55-8b2c-94c195e35179_iPhone_8_Plus_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c7/c2/f1/c7c2f157-8640-fe6a-b51d-2ad0d234f246/322d8819-503b-494b-9f63-0f1173da1d97_iPhone_8_Plus_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0c/7c/fe/0c7cfe95-1be1-b45f-6352-4471703f74b7/36ec02e4-b272-4d02-8f8f-4197e723a718_iPhone_8_Plus_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d2/2a/fd/d22afd7f-4552-00bb-0526-4612d35d7d62/f3188da1-6382-4e7c-9152-e0423478f908_iPhone_8_Plus_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0f/96/46/0f9646f8-3dbd-c0b4-c8e4-a42ea9ecd731/8e187544-21a2-48e4-89cd-fdc18b72b985_ipadPro129_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/af/82/4b/af824b69-cdae-26f7-65b1-fa5468e99337/0fd6f008-7a62-4c9c-811f-666f6c31051e_ipadPro129_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/cd/aa/07/cdaa0737-858c-0179-380c-929ef4bb1991/bc3d322d-dfec-4ddd-bc1b-5f30877098ef_ipadPro129_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a8/83/74/a8837425-1856-9d91-045a-e6af076452ad/543b5b63-5ba4-451c-9df1-f74878d73e8f_ipadPro129_4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/b1/41/5fb1410b-edec-baee-c72a-b82b7dd6be52/48f5f2c8-be51-453e-b07a-9970e623469d_ipadPro129_5.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/25/e0/72/25e0723e-4550-0dd3-91d5-ba9f195c5bef/d75c039e-51be-4a0a-b916-d2c079e8a201_ipadPro129_6.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/91/2b/08/912b0820-fc28-61cb-a598-4e37a6a17079/e733c6dd-5586-4bed-9e51-4cd9dfbb786b_ipadPro129_7.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7f/31/30/7f31307b-dafb-6199-3700-0507d68929bb/5a5213d9-7fbe-4e24-95c3-09dec6358ba7_ipadPro129_8.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/fc/fa/28/fcfa289f-40ee-728d-768f-4cce18a6c0a9/53067dc0-3f64-4889-9afd-3648db9a222e_ipadPro129_9.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iP

I wish I was able to give more of a review on the actual app but seeing as though I have contacted Apple regarding a refund due to not being able to cancel my trial on the 3rd day, I was not able to use it extensively in the time period allotted for the trial. While using it I was logged out multiple times when I went to a certain menu and I was bombarded with “please submit a review” pop ups within 5 mins of downloading it. So, my rating would be much lower were it not for Rene. She was empathetic and communicative regarding my issues and reached out again to verify I was able to cancel the next day (day 4). I do not want to use it if Apple does refund my fee because I do believe the people responsible for this app should be compensated for their hard work and when I am going to Paris later this year I will subscribe and use it in more depth. Hopefully I will be able to update my review then. Thank you Rene for your compassion and making me feel heard! | I downloaded them all.  American tourist. Lived here for about 9 months 10 years ago - so have some context but not recent.  This pulls up good memories and makes it easy to find the good stuff.  Thx! | This is the BEST app for anyone traveling to or living in Paris. We used this everyday that we were there. Thank you so much for your advice. It was amazing!! | This app has everything I need from a  travel guide app, but what separates it from the rest are the historical facts and context! Always so worried about being uneducated as I ask questions, and this app helped me make sure I understand all the important facts before I show up to a site, which makes the experience even more enjoyable! The map feature was also great for discovering what’s close to us at any point of the date, we discovered an awesome wine bar using it. Download this app! | I’ve been to Paris so many times but this app just offered so many tips I didn’t know in the past. Live it!!! | Fantastic app...extremely comprehensive information set about Paris delivered in easy to read and listen bite sized chunks. Exactly what you need when on the ground or just wanting to learn more! | I consider myself pretty well traveled, and the thing I want when traveling is a combo of Wikipedia and TripAdvisor. I love that this gives me good information while also guiding me around a place. It’s historical, informative, and genuinely helpful in finding true hidden gems. Love it — need more cities asap. | Very thoughtful app.  With wonderful voice overs to important yet less known things in France.

Used app once and wanted to subscribe but couldn’t get the app to take my phone number to send verification code. Sent request to developer twice over a week and no response. Don’t waste your time | App does not reroute me when I miss a turn and the route I put in was not even close to optimized even after refreshing for it to do so, that was the entire reason I installed the app. 2 stars for the concept I guess | Awesome app but it drains my battery soo fast | This app WAS the best routing app on the platform. Last month it logged me out of my paid subscription right before my UPS route began. Just like many users have stated, it would not accept my phone number for login confirmation…calling it invalid no matter the format. Tried support 20 days ago and recently 5 days ago. No response. I have a feeling that the Straightaway team has jumped ship but forgot to hang an “out of business” sign in the window. You guys need to REFUND me for the days this app sat useless! | I can’t even get past the authentication after downloading and opening it. The app says my phone number is invalid. I know my own number. Tried it with and then without a 1. Fail | After trying every possible phone number variation. It still will not let me create an account. Maybe it’s a good app but if I can’t get in, I’ll never know | Won’t let me login with my phone number. Support never contacts me back. And every time I click on next stop, it goes blank and I have to swipe out of the app and click back in it. | Doesn’t work | When time window’s are added to a stop it should take that into consideration and not send you to the closest stop if they aren’t open. 
If the account has a 10:00am to 5:00pm time window and it’s only 7:30am the app shouldn’t send me there next even though it’s only a mile away. 

Also when you click optimize order it should calculate from your current location not the location you put in when you first started the route. I constantly have to change my current address so it will calculate around my location. 
Overall the app does save time, and is very helpful when I have routes in cities that I’m not very familiar with. | The app works great but I cannot save my route. You have to sign in, but I’m not able to sign in, so it said incorrect phone number. if they can fix the login issue, I will give them my five star but for now one star. | Terrible app. Doesn’t let you add phone number to create an account. And it DEFINITELY DOES NOT LET YOU ADD UNLIMITED ROUTES EVEN IF YOU PAID FOR THE APP. IT MAXES OUT AT 248 | Keep saying invalid phone number so I can’t even sign in to get my routes I have saved | I like this app but the only problem it does not optimize the route it always shows data is missing when I optimize the route | I’ve downloaded the app and tried to submit my phone number for verification. It doesn’t accept my number. | Can only enter numbers, but somehow a valid phone number isn’t a valid phone number. Impossible to reach support team. 

Seems like a cool app that I can’t actually use. | Why is it so hard to enter a phone number when the app doesn’t work? Is this available for a certain part of the USA? | What a great app this is I just wish there was the option to export and to import and then the option to correct your route other than that pretty good app | Can’t verify my Number, no messages are coming through with the right number entered. | The app was wonderful in the beginning. For the last few months it has stopped routing correctly, it has the addresses scattered all over. I use it to remember my stops and to organize my routes it is now basically worthless I have to go in and manually organize my stops. Please fix it. | This is a great tool for route planning.  I can take a picture of my computer screen to auto-import my daily route.  It’s not perfect, but it gets me 90% of the way.

The app does have some bugs, and the Mapbox mapping is good, but it has sent me to the wrong address more than once.  Right now the main issue is the Apple CarPlay integration - I have to exit navigation and start again every time I disconnect my phone from my car.  Also, the “Next Stop” button went missing, so it’s a little more fiddly to progress through my route.

This app is great.  There are some issues, but overall the user experience and functionality meet my needs better than anything else I have tried. | This app is useless for letter carriers, taking pictures of parcel addresses would be considered a time wasting practice. | After a recent update, the optimize route function is not accurate. Placing “first stop” beside the end of your route point. | Update 9/3: the Developers have fixed this issue and even let me know. Excellent app, excellent team. Thanks!

Most recent update broke the follow feature. Now you press it and it goes to you but stays there and I drive off the screen. I use this app mainly for the house numbers. | Literally took me into a toll road then when I click optimize route, I was literally passing stops that said we’re optimized for last. Circuit never does that. Atleast I actually save time with them | Love the built in navigation in the app! Definitely works amazing for me and our company! We are a Subcontractor for OnTrac and i definitely recommend the app to others! | I just started delivering newspapers which means I’m going to the SAME EXACT HOUSES EVERYDAY! I love everything about this app EXCEPT I WONT BE ABLE TO USE IT BC it dose t let me save a route ( so I’d have to re write 350 stops everytime) & it doesn’t let me put in notes (so I know which house gets what paper) if you could add those two things this would be 5 stars for me! Please let me know if that’s possible! Thanks! | The app is great at route optimization, but has a couple flaws in other areas. Firstly, when taking pictures of the addresses, the detection is not super accurate. So i usually have to go through and double check and correct a lot of addresses, so i end up just entering them all in manually. Second the navigation sends me through a lot of alleys which is not ideal, and also registers a lot of addresses as being in the alleyways instead of the actual street. So a lot of the times i end up switching to another navigation app. And lastly every now and then, while navigating to the next stop, the screen will turn white and i have to close the app and go back the the stop i was on to continue my route. .. all that being said, i still use the app everyday, even though it’s a little frustrating at times.. and if those three issues are fixed the app would be perfect. All of the other features are great, and I’d still recommend it for the price and route optimization alone. Looking forward to an update with those bug fixes that i mentioned. | The best app I’ve ever used. What other app can let you take a picture of the manifest? Just this one lol | I have had very mixed results with this program. It’s great to scan in your route but the GPS can’t always find the streets. I deliver in an area with a lot of new construction and have a real problem with the GPS not being able to find certain areas. I use Google Maps in conjunction with this program when it can’t find an address. Sometimes it will take me way off my route when it can’t find an address, so I have to check every time to make sure we’re going to the right location. The one thing I would really like to see is to have the program say the address when you arrive. I’ll keep using it, but hope that the GPS gets upgraded if nothing else. | In theory this is a cool idea, take a pic and it transfers to the app and in order for the most part. I’m a mailman and liked this to begin with but it has too many issues. The worst part is When doing multiple addresses it will skip from first address to last and then you are forced to redo the stops. | Fairly easy to understand and use. I only gave it 3 stars because it lacks the ability to use CarPlay with it. | Hard to understand how one could write a maps type app and not have it available on CarPlay. That’s a deal breaker. Uninstalling. | I really wanted to love this app. I’m a UPS seasonal  private delivery driver and was looking for help in organizing my crazy country routes.  I do love that I can take a picture of my entire manifest and have it self populate. When the gps routing worked it was nice. The problem for me is that I was getting too many routing errors in my very rural route. I lost valuable time trying to find the actual property locations. Also I noticed that I couldn’t hit the check mark if I found the house on my own and then move on to the next one on my list. If you hit the check mark that should indicate stop completed and move to the next in sequence. | Good but some directions are not accurate. | This is a great app as long as you have cell service. They need to fix so you can download the maps to use offline then it would be worth every Penny and 5 stars. | Is no give option to choose what maps u want to use like other app some other let u use Apple Maps or google maps u can make it better | This app would be awesome if it utilized google maps. | I read where Zach says unlimited routes allowed. But apparently not true. Limited to a single route and 250 addresses in that route. Useless!! I hope I’m missing something otherwise I’m canceling my purchase!!
Tim | I’ve used this app for about a year now & it keeps getting better! Photo scanning route lists saves an incredible amount of time, it’s easy to use & understand. Best of all though, is the customer service. Anytime I’ve had a glitch, it’s been addressed within the hour!
WITHIN THE HOUR!! I’ve contacted support day & night… have always gotten a timely response & a solution to the problem. Highly recommend this app!!! | Works pretty good when it comes to saving you time but this app drains your battery really fast compared to other delivery apps. | 7/21-Update: thanks for adding house numbers and responding to my comment!  😊
With the update, came the addition of the ‘tracing’ of the entire route. This is terrible (for me). It creates confusion and adds unnecessary information to the delivery I am on. I don’t need to know about the next one, I need to know about the one I am doing. With the optimization working well, I trust the order as being efficient, but this extra information has made my deliveries less effective as it’s easy to confuse current and future routes, and I’ve missed stops.  Please turn that off, or make it an option you can choose to use.  
5/21-I just started doing some deliveries for work and this is a great support. My only feedback is the lack of the house number being clearly available right before you reach the location. I’m still having to refer back to my paperwork, rather than just being able to just use the app as my single source. 4 stars | This is a great app, however some of the towns I deliver to are not available. I just moved to this area and know nothing about the surrounding areas so it’s a little frustrating. Please update the maps for the small towns and addresses for the bigger ones and back highways and I would be very happy to give this app 5 stars. | The routing looks like it could really save time over some other systems and the ability to load a route with a picture is fantastic. 

There are however some draw backs depending on what company you are delivering for. 

The first drawback I noticed was the lack of load numbers. For us with 200+ stops it’s vital to have these numbers in order to find the packages in the truck. It would be nice if the software also was able to recognize the load numbers and display them along with the address for the stop. As it sits now we would need to scroll through our itinerary and find the stop then look for the load number. In the end this makes the app less efficient than our company routing software, even though the route is better. 

The second drawback is the lack of commit times. There are packages that need to be delivered by a certain time and the routing software should be able to take that into account when routing, it doesn’t from what I can tell. 

The last thing I noticed is that the software doesn’t recognize 1/2 addresses, such as 931 1/2. You have to be very careful here because it may take you to a completely different town. 

If those things were added and addressed this would be an easy 5 star app, and certainly worth paying for. As it sits now I had to cancel during the free trial because there was no way to make it work for my route. | This app is a game-changer for delivery folks. The photo scanning feature works like magic and I can add 150 stops in ~7-10 minutes. I'm new to driving my route, but this app makes me feel like a pro. I'm usually one of the first ones to finish my route. I've tried a bunch of the route planning apps out there and this one is the best one yet. | Used this app for the first time today to drop off gift packages to eleven families of my daughters’ classmates.  After the app accurately converted the photo of my destination list to usable text, it located every destination flawlessly.  I then hit the “optimize route” button and the app rearranged the destinations, resting in a savings of 52 minutes of driving.  This is a tremendously effective and useful app for route calculations and optimization.  Waze and Google Maps cannot perform effective route optimization. | I like the interface of the app simple to use only complaint I have about it is you can’t add notes to the stops I’m a fedex driver and it would be more helpful if I can label a stop as a bag or if it’s on the floor instead of shelf would just save a lot of time | I run routes for FedEx and this app takes away all the anxiety of finding everything and planning my route. | I downloaded this app with high hopes but when I try to open the app it will not open. | I thought this would be good but was sending me no random locations! Instead of lust saying address not know for Newly built homes. | I have used several route apps. This one is by far the most intuitive.  The photo feature is a game changer.

Live that you can see how many cars are in line for the Pt. Defiance to Tahlequah run. Super helpful! | all the same i do us available for free on the WADOT app and website, and this costs $? somehow I missed that and paid $2 for nothing. thumbs down. | Very helpful to have the number of open spaces! | Update the actual expected time ferry’s are departing from the dock when they’re behind schedule. | I appreciate this app at least showing what the schedule “would” or “should” be, if all goes to plan.  WSF app is somewhat futile. | Rating pop ups are a pain when you are in a hurry. App is fine except that. | With the shortage of crew impacting ferry schedules, you MUST check on line and not rely on the app for now so you don’t miss the boat!! | Always using ferry service from Pt. Townsend to Coupville, I am so glad I can make reservations as it’s a long way to drive to Kingston , where there are usually long wait lines. Driving to Anacortes only makes sense to take the run from Pt. Townsend. Also thankful there are alerts on ferry app. | This app takes $1.99 from you and offers the same info available for free on the ferry website. Complete waste of money | I have been using the WSDOT app for years and am perfectly happy with it. However I want a Home Screen widget, which this app claims to have (see last photo.) Alas there is no Home Screen widget. I will seek a refund. | NW Ferries is a basic departure time app, and that is all there is, nothing more. 
So, is it useful for anything beyond that? Like, whenever the ferry is expected to arrive at the destination? No. That kind of omission is offensive, really. | This app is to die for.   My essential ferry tool | This used to be a fairly accurate app (within 1 ferry) but this summer the warning for prolonged wait times are rarely accurate and the app is very slow or fails to update car spots left. | You really need this if you use the ferry especially on weekends.
My main complaint is that the alerts are not time stamped. You cannot tell when a 1 hour wait time was posted or if it is over. | This app is indispensable to anyone who takes one of ferries on a regular basis. Besides the schedules, it also gives real time ferry positions, which are essential during tourist season. | I bought this app so i could see the number of spots available on the next ferry. And the app doesn't show it. (Photo showed it did when i purchased it.)I wrote to developer and never heard back. Ive gone back to my WSDOT app. | Very helpful app. | I’ve used this app for years.  I has always met my needs.  Fast, clear, and concise; what’s not to like? | The reporting of space available on the Seattle  to Bainbridge route has been significantly wrong over the last few months and the alerts don’t seem to be timely either. Not sure what’s changed, but their output data is unreliable | Okay app. Just wish it provided arrival times and real-time updates when ferries are running late. | The app is fantastic but most of us ferry users travel the same single route. Please consider letting mark one as a favorite so that we don’t have to specify the route on every use. Five stars once that show up! | Vashon route: This app doesn’t even adjust real time delays and arrivals. Might as well just use vessel watch and see the normal schedule. Should be free. | I love this app as a daily commuter from Kingston to Edmonds this app saves me time and numerous headaches! | Chaotic, incoherent,random changes. Pointless, ineffective “innovations” that serve no tangible purpose. Indifferent service, delays and misdirections liberally applied to no tangible benefit to anybody. | Get your cameras updated!  The Seattle side has been down for weeks yet if you go to WSDOT app, they work fine! | Very useful app if you live on Bainbridge island or anywhere else that you need to take a ferry. Cons: a bit slow and crashes sometimes. THIS APP HAS GOTTEN BETER WITH AGE. | This review applies to the Bainbridge/Seattle run. The reporting of the available spaces was accurate for a long time but over the last few months it has been really bad. It over reports available spots on the Bainbridge side and under reports available spots on the Seattle side. Some of this my be due to the games they need to play with parking due to construction but it’s pretty consistently wrong. All of the other information is useful and accurate. | Thus app is not accurate whatsoever, when you can’t distinguish the numbers 0 & 36 you should not be providing information to the public. I depended on this app as I am an avid ferry user daily. How many countless times I could analyze this apps information with arrival time and coordination only to have me sit at the dock an hour longer more times then I’ve tracked. I would not recommend this application to anybody, for those that find success with it congratulations, however I will be reporting this app to the agencies and let them handle it. Thanks again | Does not reflect the schedule changes to the schedule in Jan 2018 for the Bainbridge routes such as 6:10 am not 6:20 departure.  Wrote to the developer. No reply. | Nice interface and whatnot. Needs the ability to make reservations from the app since you can view the number available. | Easy to use and absolutely essential for me - a Bainbridge Islander in the Pacific Northwest. I'm back and forth across the Sound all the time and this is one of my go-to apps (this and Maps and Uber)! | My.wife commutes by walk on daily.  Thus we use this app to,avoid unexpected delays. I turned the alerts off they were too many! It's worth the money for anyone using the WSF. | Doesn't allow a view of the entire ferry schedule for planning purposes | Love the Apple Watch app! | A convenient, user-friendly tool for planning ferry trips around the Puget Sound. Closest Terminal today widget is awesome. Highly recommended!!!! | Easy, accurate, up-to-date! Includes helpful backstory on delays. | Handy when you are rushing for the next boat! | Great app, cheap and I prefer it over the WSDOT APP. | It would be so much more helpful if the widget allowed the user to choose one ferry, and brought up the schedule for that ferry only depending on what side they were on. It is not helpful for me to see the loading times for each ferry I drive by, because I am headed for one ferry. It would also be helpful if it always showed the ferry times and not arrival suggestions (the peak hours notes instead of boat times). | Camera views very helpful. Schedules make traveling around Seattle much easier. | I like this app and find it useful.  It does not get a 5, however, because it lacks some two important features: 
1) It should show estimated times of arrival for the various sailings.  AT LEAST, show the estimated times in route.  This is a glaring error and, as I do not frequent the ferries other than occasionally, I have to eventually go to the web site to find this.  Maybe it is in the app and I just can't find it.
2) There is nothing explaining what ""drive up"" meant; I had to go to the creator's web site to find what that was in the video.  There should be some kind of minimal help or better labeling.

Regardless, the app is good and useful.  It could be wonderful with these improvements!

  aps. | Pleeeease support the 2 closest terminals or allow the 2 terminals shown in the Notification Center widget to be custom picked. Pleeeease. Same with the 3D Touch shortcut 

I live in Seattle and need to get to Port Ludlow. I quickly need to know the 2 upcoming ferry times for Both the Seattle and Edmonds ferry and then when returning home need to know the Bainbridge Island and Kingston times. | I bought this app after my old ferry tracker became unsupported.  This seems to be working very well with good access to the schedule, reversible routes, route alerts and dock cams.  There are one or two things that would make it better: 

1: List the whole day's schedule instead of just the future.  If you arrive at a terminal and the boats are running late, it is much easier to figure out what's going on if you can see when the previous sailings were supposed to have left.

2: To really knock it out of the park, include a ticket look up feature with a scanner. | I check this app almost daily to view the status and times of my ferry run.  Frequently the app is offline or reporting a problem connecting to the WSF server.  Seems the app was written then possibly abandoned. | This app is useful and always gets me where I need to be when I need to be there. Well worth the cost! | A great app for WSDOT ferry info at your fingertips. Well-designed, updated regularly; easily the best way to check ferry times, alerts, cameras and more. | I've tried similar apps but by far this is the best! | Great app! Please add real time updates for when the ferry will be late and why. Otherwise, great app and easy to use. | This app works great! Simple, clean, quick, design and function. Highly recommend. | Love the line counts, camera views, and the boats map.  It also seems to be accurate for holidays which is not the case with other apps.

It would be nice to grey out previous sailing times rather than delete them from view.  During the week, the schedule is always the same, and if all the ferry times were displayed (but greyed out if they have already happened) you could see what boat to catch tomorrow, without having to change days.",4.66715,2076,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/92/87/0a/92870aae-488f-6fd8-00bd-3f75f4e71eb1/765bf58f-0f9b-40c7-955f-14963eb738a7_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.41.31.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/0e/4c/4f/0e4c4f3a-c143-5791-0781-2f0e7d9da39c/99e265f0-a61a-4e0e-9c14-898f411099ff_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.44.35.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ce/4f/08/ce4f0814-2dce-f0d4-68d3-80b13c43f324/3fb835bc-0f29-4f55-b76b-c3bc0da5b206_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.41.47.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/97/9b/4b/979b4b58-cedb-5a1d-d919-121b9cfc0d80/946c623f-e596-4114-8d4d-affe350070dd_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.44.25.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/99/bc/1b/99bc1b48-8c14-0ed7-5a71-6cae7caa956d/3a33ac82-ffb4-4bc6-bdeb-e5c0005e3569_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.42.11.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/93/1d/59/931d5955-fc7f-544e-ce38-95c57bd79f57/67473dd0-c1f7-41ba-8d29-2098350e9990_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.45.47.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/d4/e9/9f/d4e99f4b-54ca-4c02-7a53-1c012a2dfb4c/b71df082-a716-4d8a-8cad-6ef4a814423a_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.41.35.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/0f/e3/da/0fe3dafa-8057-f4dd-b551-e00fcb1164f2/8c0bfcc2-a5d1-4216-90d4-def66c03a938_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.42.18.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0e/e2/f9/0ee2f99f-8617-9a52-49d0-a495291b7307/c558b56a-974d-458e-ae1b-1045b6b3f3ad_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-30_at_17.41.17.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b7/c4/be/b7c4beaf-6c04-21db-2b37-6ebe63e99951/f7bc7d2e-0785-4546-8e1c-dcbbd3d06433_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.02.20.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/38/81/2b/38812bc6-04c0-6534-fe53-4ef19ad69009/2f722e7e-0fdf-4bda-9a52-58290413f2b4_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.07.31.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/54/d6/7d/54d67d9a-cd22-bca5-aa02-1e621cd416d3/fbd7575a-65a0-4781-bc5c-e9f2742a566b_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.02.34.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/1f/cb/ac/1fcbacab-9617-d76d-5158-fb4fa0431a94/e792abf8-b5ed-401c-9d99-80331248e892_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.07.52.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/4d/bb/85/4dbb85a6-e7f5-a8e0-19d4-194b223f0a8e/19e93cc4-75d8-4c9c-9bf8-63bbea68b5a6_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.02.48.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/12/38/c1/1238c1ce-011b-df44-52b6-775bddee8747/1631dcd4-d076-4131-8c91-319645ee0f4e_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.08.22.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e4/95/9a/e4959a0e-e1dc-8fdb-3c9b-ce5572801da6/c5109355-3b97-4c67-818d-25bbab3b0f53_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.02.27.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/05/7c/7c/057c7c04-b0e9-f509-2706-a3071a03c96c/13e15fe6-23ec-4c06-be0a-4303262f8ba8_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.03.09.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/95/36/eb/9536ebf7-6210-fe4d-0fad-2b235dfd2ee3/cbd70e1b-83d7-423f-bdeb-beabd577ee63_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.01.48.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ac/7a/19/ac7a1970-484a-e886-620f-891f61a32f80/f645f2f6-5fbe-41ba-bd53-987c3f4f45a4_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2023-12-30_at_18.07.02.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""

This app worked fine for a couple of times. Then it started looting.

At the moment, I can only see when different routes arrive at my stop and where they end but not where they go in between. This seems like obvious information to have on a bus app, so please provide it! | Downloaded and used the app to find bus routes and buy buss passes while traveling through Italy, more specifically Florence/Tuscany and happy a good experience. 

Downloading and creating an account was easy (you will need text messaging/SMS to verify when create an account). 

I purchased my bus passes through the app and and had some difficulty identifying the appropriate pass to buy, mostly due to being unfamiliar with the area, but that was resolved quickly with some research on Google. Used Apple Pay (connected to a Visa) to pay for the pass with no issue. 

A feature that would be great would be the ability to search up your desired bus route and once found, buy the ticket(s) directly from the search. 

Would also like to see better instructions on what to do with the buss pass QR Code after activating the pass in the App . 

Overall, the App worked as intended and got my group buss passes without having to buy a physical ticket from the store. Saved me when I had to take a late night buss out of the Florence city center into a surrounding town where I was staying. User Experience with the App could be better. | Paper tickets are best.

PLEASE ADD CREDIT CARD TAP TO PAY ON BUSES AND TRAMS | This app is incomplete. It cannot quickly let you identify your starting point to your destination and help you buy the necessary tickets. It’s limited choices makes it useless as an app to pay for the fare you need. Especially since it’s designed to support English, it does not take into account the unfamiliar region one is in and leaves it to the foreigner to figure which routes to buy tickets for - it’s an impossible task. | Don’t waste your time. No way to buy ticket from the route planner. Payment for tickets fail. Route planner and ticket purchase place names don’t correlate. Fix your stuff Tuscany! | questa è l'app peggiore e meno user-friendly che abbia mai visto. è molto meglio acquistare semplicemente il biglietto dalla macchinetta. | The app works relatively well, not many bugs from using so far.

1. Apple Pay not working on IPhone 13 Pro wih latest IOS
1b. Not failing the whole ticket purchase process and having to rebook the route when a payment method fails
2. Ability to purchase tickets from the route page. Being a tourist, using the buy ticket function can be extremely confusing and not very intuitive when trying to select the correct origin and destination 
3. Better English translation | Like I’m going to whip out my credit card in front of SMN and start typing in all my data. If you offer ApplePay as an option, make sure it works. Worthless.

This is a scam. If the app doesn’t support the major capital of all European countries it app should ask what city you’re planning for before recommending or requiring a subscription. | I’m glad I paid for the lowest plan before investing into a yearly package. You will not get a refund. I paid $5 to find out this is an app that can only help plan cities that are programmed into it. Not any city, anywhere you decide. So hopefully the city you’re wanting to visit is already programmed or else you’ll find out you paid $5 to download and delete an app | As someone who loves exploring new places but often struggles with planning, I definitely recommend this app.
This app took the stress out of my travel planning. 
Whether you are solo adventurer or planning a family vacation this app simplifies your travel. 
Recommend! | Tried 6 different location mostly international cities  are not yet available but said it will coming soon | Let the consumer test it without having to sign up for trials. Even one time will be sufficient. I am willing to pay if it works but without testing it doesn’t make sense | I downloaded the app tried to put in the start and end of my first day and it cut off the button  for ""next"" so I couldn't select it. | idea is super cool but the app itself is not finished and lacks a LOT of places. | It's a perfect way to destress. | Does everything I need with minimal fuss. Love it. | it is really great I personally love it that's why it deserves 5 stars | You should've added a bunch more locations before launching this app. It is way too limited. Also would be great if you added things away from city life like beaches, lakes, mountains and hikes, national parks | Cant input my hotel’s address. Must choose from their list of only 10 hotels in London! 👎🏼⭐️ | Pretty much useless for travel outside of the US, and even then very limited in the places supported. | Good to have a full trip plan in this app | Would have to start over.  Meh

Budgets are crazy high even when you lower them. 5600 for a 5 day stay in Las Vegas lol.   Has promise.  Lack of international options limiting | Spent an hour playing with the app trying to get it to work right. Liked the concept but the app is super glitchy. Would edit the list of things to do, turn around to review and it would have put all of the deleted items back onto the itinerary. The recommendations of things to do is extremely limited. Unfortunate because i feel like it would have been a great way to plan out our next vacation. Overall, can’t recommend. | I just learned about this app and I’m so glad I did. It’s so easy to plan a trip, the app asks a couple of basic questions at the start and based on your responses, pulls up relevant accomodations as well as sightseeing/location points that are catered to your interests. I definitely recommend this app! | It wouldn’t let me choose cities out side of what it showed | Easy to use, great idea, six seven us cities only, pretty much did planning for me, many convenient links with others like bookings etc. overall a very helpful tool...needs more cities. Multi city planning would be nice. | Downloaded for a trip to Arizona, after installing come to find out there is like 6/7 places. Unless you are going to NY, CA, or Boston, not very helpful. | So easy to navigate!! Planned my trip to Chicago in a heartbeat!! Simply amazing! Tammy D | Very limited in where you can plan a trip add more cites and I’ll come back | This didn’t help me at all why is it only in the us | Love the app! So easy to plan my trip in almost no time. Got the best advice on my Chicago trip! Will definitely use it again for more cities! | Just used it to plan a trip to Chicago. Been waiting for something like this for years.  Love how easy it is to use! Impatiently waiting for new cities to be supported on the app. | My favorite app to use when traveling to NY. It’s really easy to use. Love going to different NY places that I haven’t visited before. The app does all the thinking for you, all you have to do is just go and enjoy! 👍🏻 | planned a trip to chicago, very quick and looks good, nice itinerary...will try to use locally in NYC | Love the Travel Fairy app. Recently used it to plan my trips to NYC and Chicago. The chatbot/assistant is easy to use, helpful and intuitive.  Can’t wait for more cities to be added! | They don’t have many cities but helped me to organize a few days in NYC to entertain friends from Europe. Hope they’re working on more cities. | I downloaded the app from an ad I saw and was super excited to try it because I’m going on a trip to Europe and the app sounded legit, then I got on and saw they only had a few American cities available 😕 | When I saw an ad for this, I was curious about how it can create a more curated trip per what we want since we’ve been talking about a trip. However, international trips need to be made as well. | I wish it had more cities, but for NYC it helped me a lot. I’ve been there many times but I had friends who came from Spain and planning a few days was a challenge. This app made it very easy | Such a useful app with popular places in popular cities! Makes planning my next trip easier and more fun! | Great app - it’s super easy to use and really helped me plan my trip to Boston. Love that it gives you how long it will take you to get from one place to another. | Finally!

An excellent idea and easy to use. I’ve been thinking of something like this for a long time. Planned a DC trip for April and it was a breeze. Needs more cities though | Good concept and strong scheduler. Nice set of features and ability to change specific selections mid trip are helpful. | Great app , many different choices . Very helpful if you don’t know the city. | Great app ! Easy to use ! We enjoyed it. | Very cool and helpful app. I just used it for NYC and it saved me a lot of time. Amazing how it picked spots for me and I enjoyed them. Good choice of restaurants too. Hope it’ll offer more destinations soon. | cool app, helped me build an itinerary for my trip to LA. i had a pretty limited knowledge of the city and i was able to start planning just by answering a few questions. looking forward to seeing what’s added in the future. | Traveling to San Francisco next month and the app has made my planning so much easier. Can’t wait to see it in action once there. Awesome job guys ! Looking forward to more cities... | Seems like this may be an excellent app as it progresses. Right now it’s quite limited on where you can choose to go. Looking forward to maybe seeing more cities or a search option to enter the city you are wanting to go to. Right now there’s only 5-6 cities you can choose from and that’s it. | Could of waited to have more cities globally before releasing this app... | Only 6 U.S. cities available. Don’t get this app or you will just get disappointed. | I spent 4 and a half months in Dublin, Ireland a few years ago as a student. Now, my husband and I are planning to go back later this year. When I saw this app, I thought it was perfect! I thought I could add the places I'd hate to miss/would love to show him and maybe discover a few new must-sees along the way. Unfortunately, they only have 6 US cities to pick from. If you're looking to for an app to help plan your international travel, this isn't the it. Very disappointed | Only let's you select from a list of like five or six preset cities?? | Buggy. Impossible to delete items or tell it that you want to see specific things. I know a lot of what I want to do, but it’s a struggle to get the app to actually listen. 

Probably great if you don’t know what you want to do, not great if you want to take control. | Release 2.7 (in September 2018) said Paris and London to come soon. Well it’s December 2019. Where are they? Any plans for other cities? This is a cool concept but it’s not very useful for international travel. | This app is only available for six U.S. cities. That’s fine, but the description should state this before downloading. | With just a few questions they can offer you a tailored trip, quite impressive!",4.27059,85,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/cb/4f/68/cb4f68a8-54bd-5b74-796e-3dc81b39fd7f/5a2b1581-0476-4b2d-bc1a-21f9a2828e78_1242x2208_ios_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/55/61/fd/5561fdbe-4ba1-bb6f-a6a3-cf15c399d9ed/75eb456e-534c-48ed-9c01-beb1295841ec_1242x2208_ios_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/15/da/d9/15dad9c0-d911-5316-4c53-ca3ada607bdb/01ac37dc-6d49-4521-bc99-fb6b27c6da80_1242x2208_ios_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/1b/57/63/1b5763df-f67a-3306-b9b3-6fed005dca83/f4cbacbb-e342-4574-90b1-d7d25e4358a2_1242x2208_ios_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/e7/6d/6c/e76d6c39-3362-97c6-a689-ac5f3ef4e59b/28f63d18-1521-431c-8bd9-7b9be301e8dc_1242x2208_ios_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

It was absolutely amazing to have everything for my travels in 1 place. Unfortunately the app stopped working. Reservations were no lnger added when forwarding to SAM via email and I was no longer able to add reservations. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I tried setting up a new account. Nothing worked. Their is no support. I would send messages using their app but got no response. No one is more upset with me. This was, hands down, my only travel app! It was that good. I have no idea what I will replace it with. | App is really easy and convenient. Input any and all travel you have and consolidates it in one easy spot. Only hiccup is the placement of the buttons on the top right or left with an iphone 14 model. Difficult to press without pulling down the notification or command center, or will be straight up unresponsive. Love the app for all my traveling. | App does not auto update new itineraries as of the past few months. I use this app for work but am now unable to rely on it. | Such a great app I have used it for about 2 years and when I travel it’s been a lifesaver. Up to the minute notifications for flight tracking and gives full arrival info when you walk off the plane. So good! | This is easily the most clear, organized, visually pretty and most importantly, helpful travel app I have tried.  Best of all its free, I have been recommending it to anyone who travels a lot.  I travel internationally about once a month to teach and this has made it SO much smoother. | The app is slow to announce gate changes and does not update calendar when flight is delayed | Better than all the airline apps | This app keeps me organized with all of my business trips. It’s like an assistant in my pocket. | I have been using this app for years since it’s automatically populated by my company travel service.  Now in late 2019 I’m finding that when I open the app the page seems unresponsive.  “See Itinerary” button doesn’t work.  I’m using an up-to-date iPhone and updated App.  Hoping bugs are fixed soon. | Consultants have always been very considerate. Thank you. | I’m hard of hearing and Sam app has been so helpful with Flight statuses. I love how this apps notifies you with any changes to your flights. So accurate and on point. A must have if you can’t hear well in airports. | I am so busy traveling at least once a week for work that Sam saves me every time with my itins and updates. I’d feel like a blind bat now without it. Like an amazing PA who is calling you with every update, you get that with Sam. | Horrible Navigation
Horrible Settings
Clearly not created with users in mind. | The app provides quick reference to all by business travel plans. In many situations, the SAM app notifies me of flight changes before the airline app or agent. Also, it is helpful to have one-stop, quick resource for airfare, hotel, etc. The reminders and notifications are nice - but the overuse of emojis can be a bit distracting. | The graphics were all over the place. Wouldn’t let me proceed. Difficult to read and navigate. Deleting. | This app is so user friendly. I use it through Stage and Screen Travel and when my agent books my travel, all airline, hotel and car reservations are automatically uploaded. It reminds me when to check in for my flight and gives me real time alerts when gates change or flights are delayed, even quicker than the airline apps I have. Highly recommend if you’re a frequent traveler like me! | This takes it to the next level! | When I am in a travel jam, Sam has been there. It was like I was texting my super knowledgeable travel friend. It is also very informative of your travel plans. Great idea for an app! | The app has all the pertinent information from my itinerary that I need quick access to. The one negative is the hotel addresses are in lat/long and they don’t always bring me to the correct address when I copy those coordinates into my navigation app. The simple hotel address would be just fine. Other than that I like the app and will continue to use it. | SAM sends me notifications before the airport apps do! | Does not work: would not recognize my logon, probably because there are conflicting instructions on whether to use your e-mail address or your associate ID | Possibly the least useful travel app ever | As a Flight Centre employee I find this app to be extremely helpful with extensive features I need while traveling. The app learns my preferences and uses that to anticipate the information I need (traffic, weather, etc.). Great overall functionality pulling all my travel related itinerary options into one easy to use app. | I try to download it many times; problems reported directly on the App Store didn't let me to download it in the beginning.

When I finally was able to download it many days after my first attempt, the App is not working.

I tried to open it and it looks like it will open but then it crashed and it closes again.

I can't open it, so, it is not working at all. | Full disclosure: I work for FC USA, the parent company of FCM Travel Solutions. That said, I really enjoy using Sam; it’s been very helpful and is simple to use.

The interface is well designed making it easy to quickly add new trips.  I especially like that there are several ways to display my travel history through maps, photos, timelines or through various statistics.   I tried several other travel journaling apps and Pin Traveler by far is the best app for my needs. | Five times | Pin Traveler is an amazing app for anyone who wants to track all of the information on their trips. I was previously using a spreadsheet to track my trips and this app takes it to a new level. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to have a digital record of their trips or plan new trips. | Very little features that are engaging. I paid and then canceled membership before it renewed (months before annual subscription would expire) and was never able to oh back in. It’s an annual subscription and I got about a month of it. | I have been using Pin Traveler for a number of years and it just keeps getting better and better.  I can easily organize my pins into trips with discreet stops and select my own master image for the trip if I choose.  With descriptions for each stop I can incorporate trip journal items.  Trips now show a line connecting all stops in sequence which is so valuable.  I also organize all my trips images across pins.  

I have 279 pins across 67 countries so indeed it is a must for me.

As important, the developers for pin traveler continue to be receptive to suggestions. | This is such a great way to document and journal all of your travel | I love this app!  I have been anle to pin every place I have been  over my lifetime!  With the new categories you can now now customize it for your special places, like my UNESCO Wirld Heritage Sites. | I used to keep a travel map with pins, but it became awkward and outdated.  I looked for a replacement and found Pin Traveler when I'd just begun an island cruise to Greece.  I loved dropping pins for every island and historic site I visited.  I loved it so much that I purchased the Lifetime Membership within days of installing it. 

I gave it only four stars, as I sometimes find navigating the features awkward and non-intuitive.  Reading the help solves some of that, but my biggest hurdle is lumping pins into a single trip.  And once a pin is dropped, it's hard (for me) to add it to a trip.  I'm hoping a new feature including easy to create and edit multi-stop trips will be added.

Additionally, since Apple has made it possible for some iPhone apps to work on Macs as well, I have been trying this out on an M2 MacBook Pro. It seems to work well, is stable, and using the trackpad as a ""pinch and drag"" device works well. 

I hghly recommend thi app, and I look forward to the updates and improvements coming soon. | What a great app! I really like a record of places I’ve traveled to. Thanks! | Amazing app that lets you track your travels! Customer support is swift and reliable! Highly recommend! | I was looking for an easy way to track the places, states, cities, and countries that I have been to and experienced over my lifetime. Doing it the “old fashioned way” of pinning a world map was no longer working for me. I came upon the Pin Traveler app and quickly discovered that it is a great tool! Full disclosure, I recently needed to extend the app to my iPad and admittedly mistyped my email address. I reached out to the app owner and they were very swift and helpful! I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys traveling! | Simple and easy to use with room for improvement. | This is a perfect tool to keep track of your travels. It is easy to use, and works as advertised. Fun! | I've been looking for a substitute for TripAdvisor's Travel Map for some time.  This is it. These guys have a simple, clean, and robust platform. Unlike trip advisor they are extremely helpful and the data is yours...not trapped behind some protected server.  I'm moving all my pins over now and they even have offered to help make the switch!  

Thanks guys. Great App. | Excellent, but how would you even be able to obtain the North Korea flag(unless you’re an important person)? | It’s very hard to use. I keep changing the color of the pins…….they are still red. | If you have been to more than 50 places you have to pay! No thanks! Removing app from my device! | The title of my review says it all. You cannot do anything without joining so it was wasted time to download. | This is by far the best travel journal I have!
I tried mutiple ones and this is the only one
 I ended up keeping and loving! Sure you have to pay for a lifetime premium but it's like buying yourself a travel diary and it will store all your memories forever! Every feature that I wanted on a travel diary is on this app! Add as many photos to every country you went too, pin places you've been to in that country and you can even specify which city you went to and also add photos and pins to that specific city!

The developers are very responsive and has good communication when I had problems. They never leave it unresolved!

This app has gotten better with the updates since I started using it back and 2021! Love love love this app! I can't wait to see what it has to offer this year! 
Loving the new Valentines heart pin, btw 🩷 | This is a great way to document your travels. I have been using this app for almost a year and it is my go to travel app. I document all my trips on the app, add tons of pictures and now it even has a route map which is very cool. The two developers are always working on new ideas and are very receptive to suggestions. You can even go back in and put in past trips and countries you have visited. Can’t say enough for this app!! | This program supercharges the old concept of putting pins in a map. The zoom in zoom out feature on the world maps gives a fantastic ability to see an overview or detail of places visited. The number of countries visited or the percentage of countries in the world visited allows a clear picture of how far your travels have taken you. Truly outstanding for a visualization of your travel history. | I have wanted and easy way to keep track of all the places I have been and this is sooooo it! I searched through so many apps like it but they were all way too complicated and not as easy to use as pin traveler! Totally recommend for any traveler. The only thing that I don’t like is that premium is expensive. I would totally get it because I love the app but I’m a broke student traveler who is spending all my money on new trips soooo I can’t spend the money but maybe one day! Love this app though! Totally recommend! | Best travel destination tracking app ever. | Premium kinda dumb, too expensive but nothing is that much better, it is worth it for the memories | The first explore I got for a place had as #1 a restaurant across a river from the neighborhood I chose. It also listed a place that has been closed for three years. | Une superbe application pour suivre nos voyages et se rappeler des chemins parcourus ! | Such a user friendly way to keep all your travel locations (and possibly memories) in one place. Every time I open the app I get a big picture of where I want to go next. | You will be limited to 50 pins if you don’t pay for some version. | Was so great until they put all of the features that used to be free behind a pay wall. You barely get any access without paying $25/year. Don’t download it. | Gives you a max of 50 pins then wants money. Really? $2.99 a week??  Other options and all over priced. Deleting after posting review | I am a frequent International traveler. Pin traveler has been a joy to use to keep track of countries and cities I have visited. 

I recently had to resolve a question about my subscription and the guys at Pin Traveler were a pleasure to deal with, very quick responses, and everything was straightened out immediately. 

Great app with excellent customer service. I highly recommend it to anyone who travels and would like to easily keep a log of their journeys. | I like it, it works as advertised
I really use it just for the pin feature to see almost the exact places I’ve been but it’s pretty cool 👍 | I’m addicted to this app. It’s exactly what I’ve been looking for to document my travels! This app would be perfect if you could list the places costed such as restaurants etc like you can fit the cities costed instead of having to tap into a city pin. | By far the best ""places traveled"" app. I use it very simply (just pin places I've been and then wishlist places I want to go to) but it's perfect and elegant and doesn't pressure you too spend money. And the nifty extra features are very cool. Thank you for making this!!! | 50 free pins, then $40 to continue. Would have been nice to know in the beginning. Delete. | Finally after years of looking for a travel diary, and over 10 travel diary apps downloaded and removed, I finally found what I’m looking for. This has everything I have searched for, all the features I looked for, finally found in this one app. This app should be renamed “Pin Travel Journal Diary. For years I would search apps with search keywords “travel diary” or “travel Journal” in the apple App Store and unfortunately this app never popped up. I believe its due to the keyword “pin”. This app is amazing! It has the capability of so much! These features include, jotting down your travel experiences like you would in a travel journey, you adding photos, Pinning locations on world map, display country flags that you visited, notates the number of places visited, provides a wishlist of places you want to visit, there is so much more! The one thing that I believe this app should try to include in the future is the ability to create a photo book. This would be another benefit or option to be available for users. I love this app. Thank you developers! | Only allows 50 destinations for free version.. pretend users to pay iver $20/year for full service | I found this app a couple of years ago and I love it! It is such a great way to keep track of all our travels around the world. | Can’t type in national parks or smaller towns. Only allows pins of major cities. Rather useless. | I use this to document each new city that I send an order to with my business. I love keeping track on how far my designs have reached around the world. Thank you!! 🧡 | Limiting free users to only 50 destinations is a waste of my time. | They want annual subscription for you to map more than 50 pins.   Very disappointed. | Don’t appreciate being told about about costs associated with this app after you register into an account | This app is good but they can improve you should be able to type In a address.and you should be able to put pictures on the address 
For free. | I have a job role that allows me to travel, plus I have always liked to get out and see the world. Using Pin Traveler is a great way to keep track, I would recommend it to anyone. | I like the app and especially the potential of the app as they make improvements. Using this as our trip journal. Can just click on a stay and see note Anne’s photos related specifically to that stay. You can also just see your total status across many trips. Very responsive to my email. | Been looking for an app like this for years. Really happy to have found it. Great place to memorialize trips and to add places to visit in the future.  Support was really helpful too.

Thank you. | I like how it has a format to organize your entire trip. | Great experience keeping me up to date on my itinerary. | I go to register a new account. Says check my email to verify it. Click the verify link and it brings me back to registering saying “unknown traveler”. I try the secondary link and same issue. | Very informative, really have not had a bad experience. This will be our first trip with Fox World Travels. | Keeps my travel organized | I have been going in loops for a few weeks trying to log in to no avail. It asks for the email, then send a “password” to use on initial login but the system doesn’t accept the password given. Unfortunately the system never accepts the credentials regardless of repeated attempts and keeps going back in circles. I even spoke with Fox World travel representative and I was told to speak with my company travel manager… Well, my company doesn’t have a dedicated travel neither use Concur for travel profiles… what’s more is that I am one of two people who book trips for myself and others.

Unfortunately I’m disappointed in the app and the lack of support. If anyone from Fox can help me figure this out, I will gladly edit my review. | Used it multiple times. Trips don’t show up till the last minute, if ever. Text Notifications don’t work. Not sure that’s a part of the app. Sent emails to support and no response. I’m a dev and I’d say it’s not good… BUT, to be fair, it might not be the app. It could be something my company is doing wrong when they book trips. I’d be happy to alter this review if I find out(if I can) | I have an itenary through my company and clicked the link to register and install the app only for my travel info to not show up. Have both a flight and a hotel, and neither is showing up. There’s also zero way to add itenaries through confirmation codes or any other means.

Edit: 1-star to 3-star
Explanation: app got the itenary from their servers | Bad | But how to log in. Gone round robin 3 or 4 times to set up acct verify email have magic code texted to verify phone, back and forth between laptop and phone. Am I to use email as user name? WTH??

I’m sure once it is set up it will be useful. Maybe I need midnight to pass after making acct for servers to reset. Right now I’m just frustrated. | So far so good 👍 | Great App.  Easy to use! | Love this - simplifies everything for travelers. | Easy to use and always sends updates | Gets you where you need to be ahead of time! | Very nice app | Just wish one could enlarge the text for those visually challenged | The app is easy to use. | App is user friendly. | This app is amazing, on-time alerts and delay notifications. Find things to do in the area, or food options close by. Map of the airport to ease the stress to figure out where you need to go!

The problem is that it makes you download the map you want to use every time you open the app. It does not store the data long and it’s just unreliable and slow.

I dont understand the difference between your apps and citymaps2go ..?!
The single city apps are much better. | I use it every time o go to Prague, and it's easy to use and very helpful | Good map and suggestions. You can add markers to find later offline. | Very easy to handle and accurate. | So glad I heard about this! Just used it to navigate the neighborhoods of Prague and can't wait to try out the app for Amsterdam! | Really brilliant for navigating offline!! | Saved my time in Prague, really great app. | Amazing app, really very helpfull and this is exactly what i looking for my trip.
Thank you for this app!!!
Would be good also to add additional features like: note on every mark on map or changing color of every saved place already visited. | Haven't been there yet, but it's been a big help so far in planning my trip! | Prague is not super difficult to figure out but it's not super easy either. Having this offline map that blends nicely with GPS so you know where you are going is amazing. Save your favorite restaurants/pubs/museums/churches/etc in specific categories for easy retrieval or just click on stars on map once saved to figure out how to get there. This was one of the best offline tourist apps I've ever downloaded. Well worth it. | Before I left on trip I marked the hotel and various venues I planned to visit.  It was extremely useful. Transportation sites were invaluable. | Just got back from Prague and loved using this app.  Downloaded the map and didn't have to use any data as gps tracked me without any data or wifi.
Great listing of restaurants etc. and sites. | Great app, really saved me in Prague | Usually don't rate apps but after a trip to Europe using this offline maps, I can asure you, this app will make your trip easier and you won't miss any important spot in the city. I used London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Rome, Florence, Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon! In Budapest I felt lost because they don't have a map for this city but Google also doesn't have a map for Budapest offline. 
I'll put 6 stars but I can't so 5 it's the closest. One more thing, all this is for FREE! And this is not all, also you can download the information about the historic places in the city and then you can get the info offline. 
You have to try it!! | I downloaded the Ulmon guide for four cities in preparation for a recent trip to Europe: Munich Prague Vienna and Amsterdam. You can drop pins, actually stars on places that you're interested in visiting including sites restaurants hotels etc. The off-line maps are fantastic and the articles helpful. I tend to keep my phone on airplane mode when I am out of the United States this app was fantastic because I was able to use the map even when I wasn't in Wi-Fi. Download the guides before you go on your trip if possible this way you can read and save articles but if you don't download it until you're there that's fine too. | The advertisements at the bottom of the page are very distracting and there is no way to turn them off. | Super app | We found this app very helpful on guiding us on a walking tour of Prague. We were fortunate to have continuous wifi in the Old Town. Never got lost, and great commentary and history details on the major tourist destinations. | Only wish it let you pin your current location. Besides that great to use while offline. | I used this app to plan our trip to Prague and found it extremely helpful for finding the top spots complete with guides and links to Wikipedia description of sites. One can also search for local activities, cafés etc. Allows you to bookmark sites and rare them. I would love to have one for every city I visit. | Have been to Prague many times and this is the best app I've ever run into.  Found many things I didn't know even existed.  Excellent | The best app for traveling! I've used it for nearly ten cities and love it! Thanks Ulmon! | Excelente | Not having cell phone service, this app was key in helping me navigate the city during me recent visit even having lived in Prague 10 years ago.  Great app. | Nice app! Easy to use. I like the search function a lot. | We're on our way to Prague, and this app has already proved useful in picking where we'd stay and the distances between sites. Yet to test it in Prague, but that's in the near future. | We were able to use the map and gps without using any data (turned cellular signal off). Great app! | The guide is comprehensive, but the maps didn't work offline for us, so this guide wasn't as useful as Umon's Amsterdam and Vienna guides were (we had those as well). | This is a must have map for getting around Prague.  It is simple, and it has everything we needed. | Best of the international offline city maps I've seen so far. Good useful detail, searchable, works well so far offline. Very pleased. | Can drop pins for all the important places you need to go. I dropped pins when I had wifi to use, then when I had no Internet, I could get everywhere I wanted to go! | I used Ulmon's Rome app a couple of years ago (called Rome2Go) and found it very useful.  Since then they seem to have rebranded and redesigned their city guides, and this year I tried to use Berlin and Prague, and didn't find them as useful.  It has an offline city map, which is extremely useful.  I think that the old versions had a list of popular attractions in the cities, which the new version is missing.  You really need some recommendations in a city like Prague - the list of things to do is much too long.  The app has the ability to rate the attractions, but nobody has submitted ratings, so that feature is not helpful at this point. | Good reading to prepare for a move to Prague. | especially in wifi-less environments like in a taxi or in a bus. Best on the iPad but okay on the iPhone. It's nice that one purchase gives you access through both platforms. | I just returned from a trip through Central Europe during which I used (or tried to use) the Prague and Vienna 2Go apps. They were both pretty much useless. My main intended use of these apps was not for the content (which was not very complete and in any event available everywhere) but for the navigation map. In Prague the map was actually showing the wrong current location (we got lost and ended up on some bad streets) and in Vienna the map wouldn't work at all. I'm glad I only paid $.99 for them but I'm still annoyed that they were useless. | The section on restaurants and pubs/drink is woefully incomplete: numerous highly rated and well known places are not even mentioned.

It seems that all the information on places is taken straight from Wikipedia - so what's the point of paying for an app when you can get the exact same information free by just going to Wikipedia.

I have numerous travel apps and have no problem paying for a useful app.  This one is not at all reliable and is not worth buying. | Exactly what I wanted and needed - for that price! Perfect! Nice wiki articles. Lots of POI. And I love the feature where you can find landmarks that are nearby your current location. I liked the app on my iPhone. I loved it on my iPad! | This would be even better if the text weren't just Wikipedia clips.",4.65385,26,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/21/0d/86/210d8617-1129-2689-e39e-886c5e4dc7b4/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/4c/fb/6a/4cfb6a42-3be3-5507-9e9e-410e1705b084/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/82/91/f5/8291f527-fafa-a49b-fa68-3d5a0d7320fc/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/00/21/2e/00212e32-325e-7eae-1062-5663e5a6cdf8/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/ed/00/f6/ed00f635-b509-53f4-94fb-ee8b9a325b48/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/7f/9f/82/7f9f8279-3327-2d34-e634-e3993b58098b/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/ae/2f/cc/ae2fcc7a-f591-1752-bcf4-6ba2eab52e1e/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/45/f6/37/45f6370d-f93c-96be-c852-14ca6e4283d1/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/7b/51/83/7b51834c-3d62-ff1d-467a-c8443e4f8cc4/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/ea/85/4b/ea854bc9-a225-9963-34e7-40cc0908b08b/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Sales gimmick. 
Been here for 3 days. 
Haven’t used app as I cannot get any useful info at all. | I LOVE IT!!! | It is a fantastic app that allow you to have an offline map, place locators and add notes. Love it! | Very good | Thanks a lot | I think it's useful for tourism | Bu zaten bir kullanmalı app bana yardım verdi | Very good and useful app, I have used it in my last visit to Istanbul | Nice& helpful | Good app | Needs more emphasis on public transport and points of tourism interest. For example more colorful depiction of subway stations and courses and bus stops. If so I would give it five stars. 
Thank you for your useful app☺️👍🏼 | Excelente aplicación que permite acceder al mapa de la ciudad, sus atracciones, hoteles, puntos de interés, sin estar conectado a internet, más aún permite ver la ubicación en todo momento por triangulación con las antenas de celulares, sin tener que acceder a internet o gastar roaming internacional. | I was trying to use this as an offline map for directions in Istanbul, & it worked the best out of the few I tried. (Better than Google Maps for sure). It had all major tourist attractions on it, almost every restaurant I tried, & it let me zoom in & out & search. It loses a star because it can't calculate a route for you - it reroutes you to he phone's native app - and because the GPS was strangely not as accurate as Google or Apple Maps. But overall, this worked the best for me out of all the map applications I tried. | Nice and practical!! | Very good app for trip arrengement and tag your favorite location, offline map excellent. You never lost with this application. 
It has very good suggestions for places where you can see. | Good but could be better!
Best app for istanbul that is available. | Great app. | Must have app if visiting Istanbul. It offers offline experience with all locations. | Highly recommended | Finding this app tremendously helpful.  Some tips as suggested by other user will make it even better. | No nonsense, has a lot of landmarks, restaurants, etc. without constantly trying to get more money from you like so many other so-called free Istanbul guides. And hey, it's free, so why not check it out? | These maps are my keys to the city while traveling. I just wish they had route mapping/saving, metro maps, and a few such additional features | I love this app. It allows you to save everything you want and it works as a gps as it shows your movement even when you are not using any data/connected to wifi! Highly recommended. | The app offers both maps and detailed site information for many of the places that I plan to visit.

I have repeatedly relied on Ulmon to help me navigate in unfamiliar territory. They haven't steered me wrong. | Excellent application, search well organized, with options for types and sorting, very useful. | It's a really good app that allows you to find whatever you want in Istanbul ;but, I think it would be much more helpful to add navigation (especially public transportation navigation) to your map.
Thanks so much... : ) | Very good,please improve locationing. | That is a great app. And I will recommend it strongly | This map is great. You can view the map online or download it and view it offline. Even offline, with no cell signal, it keeps track of your gps location. Super easy to use and has everything marked. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!! | Nice app and it is so useful
Thanks | Very helpful.  Thx | Very handy for planning a trip ! | Solid offline map. Aesthetics aren't the best but this is a highly useful app for anyone touring Istanbul without 3G. | Ulmon maps are my go-to apps for traveling.  Being off-line is essential and, with GPS compatibility, they haven't led me astray yet.  They're useful for researching in your room before you head out, identifying unexpected discoveries and finding mass transit.  Being able to save waypoints means you'll always be able to find your car or hotel, no matter how confusing the city.  If there's an Ulmon map available for the city I'm traveling to, I always download it.  Thank you, Ulmon. | Very useful app, working offline made it even much better, without it, we would have been lost in Istanbul long time ago. | Wonderful and very practical app. Will also give you GPS dynamic  position on the map. Used it for a week in Istanbul and was more helpful than the local Guides. It is a must. Amazing | This was an excellent tool for my recent trip to Istanbul. Similar to having a handheld tourist map of the city, except it offers a much more detailed street map I believe courtesy of Google, as well as Underground map, and even ability to search for landmarks/restaurants/hotels/etc on the map. Also very helpful was the ability to open up Wikipedia pages of all the tourist sites all while offline. Great app! | U will be not lost in Istanbul | Five days in Istanbul and this app saved me so much time. The offline map is priceless! The search engine is also great; not all locations are listed but plenty are. I highly recommend this app to all Istanbul visitors! | Ben ilk kez irandan İstanbula geldim ve bu app bana çok yardım etti | I walked for 5 days in Istanbul with this app. Its a full featured app. Like it. | I really like the 2go series, but in the end the Istanbul guide (or any other offline guide of Istanbul) is only as good as its Open Street Maps foundation which is spotty and incomplete. | It was very helpfull it makes me unlostbul | Nice app. I used the mapping tools every time I go to Europe and the info provides is useful | Nice app with great and simple offline map, thank you! | Easy to use and packed with features. User friendly maps allow you to navigate the city in real time. The wiki feature is a great source of information relating to all the historical landmarks and more famous bars / restaurants.

I'm excited to start earning cash back - great for avid travelers! | Looks like you have everything you need here in one app. | Useful app | Awesome app! | The design and layout of this is alright it almost doesn't look real but helps out to what you're looking for. | Love the app because you can travel but also get rewards for doing so. | I'm a huge fan of any app that can help make my traveling cheaper and this one does just that! Looking forward to getting to use it more for all my future endeavors! | Great | I love everything about this app. It's the most beautiful, relaxing, positive, affordable app you will ever find. | I love the concept! This app allows travelers to receive cash back instead of reward points. Definitely using this for my upcoming trips! | Being rewarded sounds awesome | Easy to use and so helpful! Love it!! | This app will come in handy on long trips and planning for them! Plus, the name is awesome! | I recently downloded this app and it seems really easy to use and it has great prices in flights. I wish I had founded it a few weeks earlier because I already purchased flight tickets in a higher price than what I see on the app 😭😭. But I will deffinitely buy my next flights tickets from this app 😁🤗 | This is a really cool idea and as someone who has a great interest in traveling, I definitely would love to get cash back for doing it! Even though it's not always a lot of money in cash back, if you use the app for everything involving traveling it'll start to add up. The layout is simple and easy to use but looks professional. Overall, this is a great app for the avid traveler looking to earn some cash back on their purchases. | I'm planning for an Europe trip and this is gonna be a great tool for it. Can't wait! | I just downloaded the app so I haven't used it to book a trip yet but I will soon. It appears to be very easy to use and the prices on the flights look great. I look forward to using this app to plan my future trips. | I was at first a bit skeptical about the value of this app, but utilizing it I've truly realized how useful it is. It's super user friendly, and being able to be rewarded for traveling is a great bonus and makes it totally worth downloading. I'm so glad to have found this, I've discovered good flights and hotels that fit to what I need. I will be recommending this to all my friends and family. Along with this, you are also giving back to your community and customers with a thousand dollar trip, which I would just love to use to visit my family ❤Thanks so much! | I found this travel app on Facebook & let me tell ya , this app is the best travel app available. It offers a search for hotels, flights , and car rentals all in one. I no longer have to flip from site to site to compare prices. Thanks so much ! | Haven't bought anything yet but I like the reward options available | Very user friendly, easy to navigate, great deals | I like these travel apps and the leg work they do! | I love the concept, and I'm a total fiend for cashback opportunities. The UI is a bit clunky, though. I'd love to see it looking less dated. | Writing a review for a chance to win $1,000 | Nice way to plan your trips and enjoy the best of your destination | I like this app | Awesome if you love to travel! | I am giving the app four stars because I have not booked a trip yet through the app, but i intend on doing so, along with my close friends for our next girls trip. So far the app looks very detailed and easy to maneuver around to plan and find your ideal vacation. I love the layout of the app compared to other trip planning websites I.e. Expedia or trip advisor (not bashing the other companies). I can't wait to try out this app! and give a five star review. | I want to write a review and get a chance to win a $1,000 because I want to travel that's my dream and I want to see my friends and cousins anywhere here in US.i hope I will win thanks Godbless | Easy to use | Truly a remarkable travel tool. It's so user friendly and versatile. I absolutely love it! It's my new travel secret weapon | It makes all my searches super easy and fast! Recommend ! | I found better flight price estimates for Tokyo for next May with a google search. But I will keep the app for the moment for the contest lol it also seems you don't get much cash back, even if the flight is expensive. | This app is everything and I love it | Really like the simplicity, made planning my trip a heckuva lot easier | I love this app to travel with. Everything you need is on here and it's nothing short of a great way to plan your next vacation!!! So wonderful! 😊😊😊 | Wish I knew this app before I booked LAX>NYC>LON>BER | I like that this app has everything you need to book a vacation. It's just like other websites/apps who have the same concept but I like that you get cash back instead of points that take forever to add up to a reward. It's also cool to see upfront how much you're getting back on a booking. I find more value in the idea of saving an extra dollar. Can't wait to use it for my next booking. | Can I have my prize now please? | Planning a trip in the near future and I love that this app can help me earn a few bucks back. Clean and user friendly, I'll definitely be keeping it on my phone for a while! | Excited to find out all the deals I can find for my travel | Need to see how it compares to other travel apps. | Can't wait to use this app on our upcoming trip to Europe! Love traveling and am always excited to find something that makes it easier to do so! | When I was downloading this app, I didn't expect it would be so good. It appeared one of the best apps I have. There is everything at one place, like hotels, flights and even renting a car. Everything you need for planning your next trip, just at one place. I will use it forever! | This is great concept and easy to use app! I definitely recommend using it when making hotel, flight, or car rentals.",4.37333,75,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/1a/a2/ac/1aa2ac9a-309f-22a4-f716-6b68a1f7d739/5a0e2aa7-1b92-4517-b068-b453735c0edf_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-10-30_at_23.19.34.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/21/45/7f/21457f18-be3b-7be8-c8e4-a5c60151d014/c51a81d9-b196-454e-a011-b079a214f96a_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-10-30_at_23.19.37.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/66/e0/88/66e088d7-0747-9ab4-bafc-218c379335c7/f35c3d83-18b9-4147-b433-78b75191c8e5_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-10-30_at_23.20.04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/5c/cc/b5/5cccb517-10b2-50e3-9c4c-a1a311361b5d/42b983f8-8783-4c5c-97ef-3ee03456c1a3_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-10-30_at_23.19.28.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/f1/b8/74/f1b874d6-a2aa-cfbb-34f9-559f61f0afa2/c338fdb5-0a2e-4ffa-8261-e3d4ddd5d1d9_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-10-30_at_23.20.24.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/9f/80/23/9f80236b-f179-6e53-7008-3b2fcd6e58b7/6b09e9cd-121c-4448-b49d-2c0b26f2c8d1_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00284th_generation_U0029_-_2020-10-30_at_23.25.33.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/35/6f/59/356f5911-baec-c131-c8ac-c06be6bad89b/14ce9fde-f0eb-4dc3-91d9-637f883b4f93_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00284th_generation_U0029_-_2020-10-30_at_23.25.37.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/cc/05/47/cc05476f-34d1-c19e-2419-42dc0d1a5360/83177546-fabf-4923-b3aa-f22a7cb609e8_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00284th_generation_U0029_-_2020-10-30_at_23.25.27.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The CTA web site bus tracker has a ‘Refresh’ link so it should be possible to add an update function.
Get rid of the ads (the app opens with an ad) & add a Refresh button and this app would rate a 5.

In fact, deleted other Apps I had downloaded since I never used them.
The best feature was the ability to track my preferred places to visit on the map which also gave me thumbnail reviews of each place. | I will never travel without it again | No more trying to figure out where you are on a big clumsy map, blowing in the wind and ripping wet in the rain. I've used the maps from this company for several cities so far and it's like discovering the convenience of smart phones all over. Enter and mark all the places you want to go in the city, and plan much easier and faster knowing where it all is in relation. Easily walk to your destination without relying so much on taxis, public transportation and locals who don't know either. How did I travel before Ulmon Maps? | The information in the free version is almost nonexistent. There were only two food related stories and one other one. The offline map could have been fine, but once I looked at on of the aforementioned info stories I couldn't get back to the map. | Usually don't rate apps but after a trip to Europe using this offline maps, I can asure you, this app will make your trip easier and you won't miss any important spot in the city. I used London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Rome, Florence, Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon! In Budapest I felt lost because they don't have a map for this city but Google also doesn't have a map for Budapest offline. 
I'll put 6 stars but I can't so 5 it's the closest. One more thing, all this is for FREE! And this is not all, also you can download the information about the historic places in the city and then you can get the info offline. 
You have to try it!! | This app has cut down on the time I spent planning and struggling to get on Wi-Fi abroad, so I could navigate effortlessly! It has no transit planner, but combined with Berlin's BVG transit app or Google Maps it's all you need. | A must app for berliners | We have been traveling throughout Europe and in all the major cities like London, Paris and Berlin, this maps performed just excellent. I would recommend them to everyone. | Without my data plan, I love being able to go around Berlin and still get information on sites. | High recommend - great offline map, knows where you are, points in right direction, knows almost everything about the city! I got around without looking like a lost tourist. | I love it. So easy to use and has everything you need to know about berlin from sites to visit to places to have an amazing german gastronomic experience. And the offline map is a huge plus. I fell in love with berlin before i even go thanks to this great app. | Great app to navigate and find stores etc. | The best offline map and guide. Genius design | It's great to have this map downloaded so I'm not burning megabytes while traveling abroad. It shows you where you are and what direction you're facing. Very handy. | I didn't buy a data plan for Europe so I was happily surprised by everything this app could do offline: locate where you were, give directions and show you the Wikipedia entry for landmarks. It met all my needs. | Great app, very useful! | I never could've navigated Berlin without it! Used the pins for the addresses so I could get from place to place. | Really cool app for the city when you have no internet. Don't forget to download the wiki guide. Helped us a lot when we were there and biking around town. Thanks. | If you don't have internet available the offline package is great. Good pictures and descriptions and easy to find things near by and far away. Get the Berlin transit app too | Muy buena | The best brand of apps for travelers! All functionality works on airplane mode (without wifi or cellular connections) which is incredibly helpful for the cost conscious traveler. Couldn't be happier with this hidden gem! | This app helped me walk home when I couldn't find any wifi & I was staying with a friend abroad! Hooray! | It's a very useful offline map showing almost every point in the city. A must have app if you dont want pay high 3G bills to your gsm provider. | Love this ap. great maps, on the iPad makes it easy to scan an area. Lots of information. In a week, I find out how good it really is on the ground. | This is a great app! it work of line which is a Big plus!!! | Looks good & detailed with popular retail locations listed. | As others have said, this, and other travel apps by this developer need public transportation maps, specifically U-bahn and S-Bahn maps. Bus maps would be great too, but not needed as much by most travelers. 

also, I've found that the GPS 'direction' is usually off by 90° or so. When facing north on a street, the 'scope' of the GPS claims I'm facing west.  Or east. Or somewhere other than I'm pointing. Not a huge issue unless you're lost in the woods, but ...

Also, the POI buttons that pop up are often slow to respond and/or don't respond at all. 
The subway/tram/sbahn/bus stops don't even list what line they're on, let alone where they go. Not really useful unless you just need *somewhere* to get away from where you are. Also, the icon for a subway stop is just a square. not so helpful, either, since the map is otherwise pretty full of icons that represent what they are supposed to.

Better than nothing, but could be improved. | I used Ulmon's Rome app a couple of years ago (called Rome2Go) and found it very useful.  Since then they seem to have rebranded and redesigned their city guides, and this year I tried to use Berlin and Prague, and didn't find them as useful.  It has an offline city map, which is extremely useful.  I think that the old versions had a list of popular attractions in the cities, which the new version is missing.  You really need some recommendations in a city like Berlin - the list of things to do is much too long.  The app has the ability to rate the attractions, but nobody has submitted ratings, so that feature is not helpful at this point. | Without a map of the u-bahn, s-bahn etc
lines (compare with London2Go, which has a Tube Map as well as the city map) this app is basically pointless. Total waste of $2. | I had hoped for more.
Would be good if you could enter an address and see it on the map.
Also since subways and trains are so plentiful - a map and the ability to enter an address and get the shortest train routes to there would be really good.
Teh descriptions are from wikipedia - not really focused on tourism per se.
I would pay $5 for something that had more complete feature set. 
This was mildly helpful. | It was a bit disappointing.  Te map was good but the guide didn't often work.  I was looking forward to just being able to use the iPad more or less by itself, but there was no subway map, and the guide didn't often work.  When I had wifi, google maps was much more helpful.",4.75,32,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/bd/d5/ad/bdd5ade0-cfe7-ac34-4d4e-7c4004c497f9/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/40/c2/52/40c25248-7bd1-6b6e-29c1-f9fe3d02f56f/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/73/74/9a/73749a44-dd3a-2b89-89a5-0e9d1573ad71/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/bb/e5/84/bbe584b9-74e7-7854-ea88-99edf02d8c4b/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/27/59/9f/27599fd1-8bae-df19-4794-1fe9521e9a9d/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/6d/c2/34/6dc2344a-e355-307c-370f-f28810798716/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ef/49/ff/ef49ffac-6fc1-39f0-9fcb-b7546a1e4e4e/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/9e/de/06/9ede06c6-70f6-19da-6d37-127caed835d4/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/15/89/0b/15890b22-bf9e-3f32-00b6-fa3260d545d1/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/47/fa/61/47fa61c7-20a4-c9e6-5e94-4bfec52dcbcb/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Ride recoded just fine. Had internet connection problems when I clicked save ride. Ride DISAPPEARED. | I thought I got REVER pro bundled with RPM but a lot of the REVER.co assets have been offline for over a week.

Update 4/17: This was resolved after posting this. No more SSL errors on site and was able to get everything linked up. | I love it recording all my ride and enjoy chowing to friends | Excellence in performance! | Are used to use Garmin software to map my routes, but I now use REVER . It is so easy to find great roads and the app works great on the bike. | Tracking the route is cool, but being able to plan a route in advance is way cooler. Since figuring out how to make it work, this has been my go to application for planning rides in areas I’ve never been before. The integration with Butler maps and BDR routes is phenomenal. Turn by turn directions is trash. I’ll only use Google maps for that. But following a GPS route works great. | The only good thing is that it uses Butler maps
Does not snap the road when planning a route on your phone.
Errors out when choosing twisty route half the time
Not very intuitive | REVER is the best! Great app and concept. I did forget about signing up for the 6 month free trial until I was charged for an annual membership. They promptly got back to me and refund the membership. Unheard of, these guys are honest | After creating a ride and trying to open it I’m getting an error: Unable to Load Ride. Ensure you have a stable network connection and try again. No matter if it’s a wi-fi, or cellular - the same. So it doesn’t solve the problem for which it was created. | I’m enjoying this application and I get to save all my rides. | When it comes to be able to jump on a bike look up shared rides that you want to tackle OR make your own route the Rever is one of the best apps out there. I have been riding off and on road for over 50 years and once I tried the free Rever app I was hooked. I recorded quite a few of my rides in order to get back to the cool things I had found on the rides later. Then I signed up to try the Pro version of Rever and absolutely enjoy being able to make road and back country rides to share. You can make tracks, add waypoints, POIs, and the always great turn by turn line to follow. 
*The notification to family/friends that you are taking off on a ride, they can track you in real time for safety and let’s them know when you are home or your destination. I ride solo a lot and having someone know where and when my ride has taken me. They can see where I am in real time and share that with EMS/Rescue or need for a tow truck for repairs. For the money it is very had to beat thing function. There are other apps that do nearly the same but I really like the simplicity of Rever. The Pro version is really a super upgrade in all areas at a very affordable price. Thanks Rever! | Kudos for butler maps and the concept - it genuinely does help with planning interesting road trips. However, ultimately as a paid user I’m quite disappointed with my overall experience:

- you can’t export your routes to a gpx file (support team told me to use their website instead…why not just add this as an app feature?) 

- you can’t copy/open a point on the map externally. There are so many use cases especially on a tour where I need to lookup more info about a place or navigate to it using a different app. This is so frustrating that I end up just not using Rever on my rides. Raised with their support team ages ago, nothing was done. 

- map layers - cell phone coverage would be useful. The pdf layering system could be implemented better. It forces you to visit their website and figure out what regions to download/upload as PDF files into the app. Why not just make these simple toggles within the app? Better still, visually highlight potential areas of interest to download, since it’s a useful discovery tool in itself. 

Personally I’d like to see more focus on core trip planning tools (as this is where Rever shines) rather than news feeds and social stuff. It just makes the app feel bloated and distracted from its core purpose. Fingers crossed the app improves over time. | User friendly and Greta for planning routes for rides | Love this app use it every time I ride | I’m a new rider and signed up for the Premium REVER option.

Generally I like the features offered but two glaring problems:
1. The route mapping option is nice, until you miss a turn or deviate at all from the initial route, as the app seems completely incapable of rerouting. It says it’s rerouting, but it just gets stuck and never actually finishes the task. This happens every time, no matter how strong my signal is or if it’s at the start of ride or at any point during. Only fix I can find is to close the entire app and start over.
2. An absolute battery vampire! Keeping the app open kills the battery on my iPhone 13 pro at least twice as fast as anything else I run, much faster than the usual gps apps.
3. The Rider Community section is incredibly sparse in the SF Bay Area. Would really like to see an effort to change this.
I want this app to be great, but unfortunately its  only “So-So” thus far. | What an awesome way to plan track and share your rides | I canceled Rever at least by 2021. Every year they have charged me since at least 3 times after I canceled. In 2021 they gave me a refund in 2022 I didn’t catch it. This is extremely frustrating. 

REVER REFUND AT LEAST THIS YEAR, DELEAT MY ACCOUNT AND QUIT CHARGING ME | I’m a pro member and I lost my routes when phone went out of service range. I purchased the pro membership because I was told I could see the Back Country Discovery (BDR) routes, recommended ADV Routes and the Butler Map routes. I downloaded the area of the map I wanted to cover (took 45 minutes to download, be prepared). I then overlayed the routes we were taking for the day. We get on the road and are about 2 hours into the wilderness with no internet. The app closes for whatever reason and when I rep-open it the routes are gone. I try to reload the routes and I get an error message “Menu not available, please make sure you have a stable network connection”. So now we have no clue of what way to go at that fork we came to miles from anywhere. Luckily we had a backup, but if we didn’t we would have been screwed. So, great map but not a solution for adventure riders, or riders who want to hit trails or roads that need routes all the time. | This app is ok, but the ui is weird. It works with my bike, which is why I have it, but man! I wish they had thought about the ui a bit more. | I installed Rever to test it (along with a few similar trip-planning apps). My intent is to pay for the one that works best for me. I'm now getting 1+ push notifications PER DAY from the Rever app telling me about all the things I should do with it to bring joy to my life. Oddly—or not, really—these usually lead me to an admonition to sign up for a paid subscription, AND THERE IS NO WAY TO STOP THE PUSH MESSAGES without completely silencing the app! What the heck are their management and Dev teams thinking? An annoyed customer isn't going to be a good customer. Forcing those messages down my throat will not make me any more likely to buy or subscribe to something (AND they are a violation of Apple's iOS app-approval guidelines). I honestly don't understand this mentality. It sure as heck ain't a good way to get money from me, though. | Both relate to the routing engine during turn by turn directions, which no doubt they license, so idk if they can fix:

1.  If you go off course at all - stop for gas, backtrack to take a picture, etc. - the app tries endlessly but often fails to reroute. Same if you resume a saved route midway. That results in an endless, annoying beeping in your earphones till you end the ride, save it, reroute again -  it basically forces you to stop your ride till you do this or turn off the app or the beeping will annoy you to death. 

2.  Unlike Google or Apple maps, it doesn’t tell you how far till the next turn. Just a sudden “turn left on Dingus Street” as you blaze through the intersection (then get the endless beeping, per #1 above). So you can’t work by voice alone, you have to keep your (battery draining) screen active - a showstopper on long rides if you don’t have power to your phone on your bike. 

The “twisty routing” engine is really fantastic and AFAIK unique, but locks you in to Rever - you cannot hop to another map program to solve the above problems. Which would be fine  (despite weak traffic data) except for above. 

If they can fix these, the inclusion of Butler likely makes Rever unstoppable for sport and sport touring bikers. If not, they leave space for a competitor to best them. | Still needs work to be done on app function’s but it’s getting there slowly | Great app. Would give 5 stars if carplay would mimic the same features as the mobile version. Top on the list IMHO should address the orientation of the vehicle. Would be great to add a compass like in  other apps.  Currently, I am unable to turn off true north. Great work on this app otherwise. | Overall, this is a good app. Easily navigates to your point of destination and provides good turn-by-turn navigation along the route, while providing information about adjacent roads when traveling. The only problem that I have with the app is that I signed up for it but am unable to access the pro features. I’m going to uninstall it and reinstall to see if that will solve the problem. | I use it almost daily! works amazing! | I like using the app! Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars (feature requests): 

When planning a ride, it lets you choose either the fastest route or the most scenic route between two points. Unfortunately, it won’t let you mix. So if you’re taking the highway to the canyons, you can’t plot the ride. If you plan the direct route to get there, then switch to scenic, it will reroute everything. 

Also, it would be nice to be able to drag and drop the route, like you can do on Google maps. 

Otherwise, great! | The basic premise of being able to build routes and save, then ride them is not functional.  I have tried to create multiple routes (twisty and custom) and have to dive too deep into the app to get to them and in multiple cases it was not saved. 
Cancelling the trial after 2 days of testing. 
Developers need to use this app on bike with gloves to see how their customers use it.  Feels like an immature STRAVA wanting to be TikTok with all the content suggestion

Hard pass for real navigation planning. | Massively annoying app.  The app is for phones, so on a tablet, it’s real small.  The map is sideways.  If you tap the North button, it just rotates and zooms way out.  Turn your device sideways, and the map also rotates another 90 degrees in the wrong direction so it’s still sideways. | When you combine the website interface with the app- it’s pretty good overall. It’s easy to plot out a route on the website. Saving your work makes it accessible on the app. From there you can share it with REVER friends. But the app itself is where the overall package is falling short. It seems disorganized and very messy- like they are trying to pack way too much into it. The navigation is nonsensical and certain functions just don’t work- or they are so over complicated that users give up and assume they don’t work. A specific example is trying to plan a route in the app itself. Even a single waypoint route to a local destination is just … dumb.  A good design would have me long press on the map where I want to go then show me my options. Highways , twistier, tolls, whatever.  This simple task does not appear possible from within the app. Or - it’s so over complicated that few people are going to bother with it for more than a couple attempts. So REVER is good if you want to make plans in advance, plot them out on your laptop, then just limit the app to the actual ride. Trying to operate solely within the app itself is likely to be extremely frustrating to many people. And I do not mean computer illiterate people. | Issues with approval notifications when creating communities.

Community functionality is very limited on the app

Buggy for creating routes. I had multiple issues where my destinations disappeared after creating a route.

I think it’s decent in the free mode but I don’t get the value for 40 dollars a year. I tried to make communities abd really get into this app with ambitions to keep premium but just couldn’t do it.

3 star review is for premium. 4 or 5 for free version. | Only 3 waypoints for map making unless you upgrade. Thanks but google maps will do it. | You have the option to create route others may enjoy and vice versa which is a sweet feature. Also useful to track your top speed on a trip. | I tried to upgrade my plan to the annual plan but the Rever website was not taking any of my card payments. I tried on my phone browser, N app, on my laptop, using different browsers, but none of those methods worked. I contacted customer service and their response times were well over an hour. I have been speaking with them for almost 6 hours with no solution. In these six hours, the agent has responded three times. Each time only after I continue to follow up after an hour of no response. I am very disappointed as I was looking forward to using this app for my upcoming trip this weekend, but due to the lack of professional customer service, I do not think I will be using this app. | The app looked great and reviews seemed positive. When I downloaded it and tried to use it the app constantly said there was an error. The system would never allow routing our navigation. | I used to use ESR which was fine , but I tried REVER when I joined the RPM program (pro version) I most like Butler maps feature, weather overlay, free app I’d good but it’s definitely worth the upgrade. | Living in an area without a lot of motorcyclists, having access to REVER has allowed a huge increase in understanding the options for riding great roads! REVER is awesome and I would highly recommend it. | I tried to use navigation with it.  If you go the wrong way, it just beeps at you frequently and doesn’t detour or provide advice on how to get back on your route.  And, I just paid for Pro and brought it to Europe for an epic week of riding.  Twice now, after a full day of riding I chose to save the ride.  Both times it went to a page where you usually populate ride info.  But on the page, there were only grey squares representing the boxes that would normally contain text and fields for data entry.  Just a useless page that never resolves.  And when I tired of that hang, I hit the back arrow and poof, the days ride was gone. Gone for good and forever.  

I’ll never use this horrible pile of code again and I hope they choke on the money I paid for it. | Well, the app seems polished. When it comes to actually creating a navigational ride real time, the interface is not very user-friendly. It seems that it would be best to create the route on the website rather than on the actual app itself. Which is rather unusable if you’re just creating a new ride from scratch while out for a ride! | I love that it tracks your miles, speed, time moving and stopped. I shows exact route in case you want to do it again. I highly recommend this app and it’s free!! | I really like REVER for tracking my rides and the community aspect.
I go on discovery rides all the time and use REVER to track my ride then I want to bring up my ride and. ”ride it” but turn by turn directions is worse than useless!
I don’t want to have to look at a navigation screen there is enough to look at without adding that to the mix.

I hope they sort it or I’m going to drop my subscription. | I would give it 5 stars if it wasnt for the rerouting issues. If there is a closed road, I literally have to open another gps app so I dont get lost. Also, when importing rides, they rides are not 100% accurate. Other than that, this app has so much potential but right now is not worth to pay for it. | There’s other apps out there *ahem* (Detecht) that have the sms crash notifications and all the other features that REVER offers. How’re these other apps (👆) are much more user friendly when it comes to creating and navigating twisties. When I run REVER on my new iPhone 13 Pro it take only 2 HOURS I’ll say that again so you get it, 2 HOURS for my phone to go from 95% to 20% while using turn by turn, that’s absurd. The only thing I would keep REVER around for is the US community but just use Facebook if you want to keep up with your local community. | I would sharing and adding rides should be easier and map needs to be updated my routes try to take me thew ppl yards | First long ride today using REVER. It wa too hot to have my phone on so I used the turn by turn directions. Terrible. No indication of how far away the next turn is. Very little warning when it’s upon you. Had to turn around more than once. It also tried to turn me down a road that clearly hadn’t been there in a while. So an updated set of maps is in order as well. I won’t be renewing my subscription without improvements. | This a an excellent app. I don’t even gave the paid app & there are tons of features!!! Highly highly highly recommend this app. | This app is a great idea. I like being able to plan a route on the computer and just plug it on the bike. I’d give it 5 stars IF you could skip waypoints. Why do I have to close navigation and start over if I “miss” a waypoint? That’s not easy on a bike. I met a buddy at a gas station on a long trip not too long ago. When we left, the app kept telling me to turn around because we didn’t meet at the McDonald’s next door as originally planned. If I could skip waypoints, that would not be a big deal.

June 2023

Changed my rating to 1 star. I’ve tried to use this app several times over a few years, and it just continues to disappoint. I gave up using for route planning and navigation, because the navigation is just bad, and the waypoints are a pain. The subscription is absolutely not worth it. I’ve tried to use it for tracking routes and mileage on my dirt bike. It seemed to do well as long as my phone had a signal. 

If the phone doesn’t have a signal, your data is lost. Why doesn’t it save my route on the phone??? Why is everything stored on a server somewhere. That’s just stupid. Goodbye. | It’s getting better but it would be nice to have tutorial videos. It would be nice to control other cameras. Usability in vehicle dash systems needs improvement, especially the radar feature as it’s important to know when and where rain might be on the ride. | This app will leave you hanging on the road with a blue line that travels off your screen making you think you’re off route. Also, any changes in your planned route ( like a one turn detour and then back on track) will leave you lost. The app won’t pickup when you’re back on route. I tried getting help to no avail. Frequently asked questions won’t address the problem above because they don’t have an answer. I canceled my subscription in the 14 day trial period but they sent charges 3 days after my cancellation. | This app has incredible features and attention to detail. It gives you so many riding options and locations. I love the fact that it give you the ability to pave your own path whether it be off-road or on the road. It also gives you the opportunity to connect and stay connected to other riders. | I love how you can 3D your ride! And you can have the app find a great new route for you!",4.6478,11181,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ba/8e/c0/ba8ec06f-52c5-16be-dd5d-3b7516c0681d/91a235be-1bfc-45c8-899c-3962e7e41fc9_Rever_v5_iOS_2208x1242-1.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0f/ec/cf/0feccff4-3d4f-122f-b574-43d0445eb541/3544fae7-e1a6-4770-ae68-972e8bc03802_Rever_v5_iOS_2208x1242-2.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ef/aa/e2/efaae250-a8c0-8b4d-3a56-0c31605f1366/b6f99140-9e11-4326-be53-0648637072b8_Rever_v5_iOS_2208x1242-3.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e8/9d/5b/e89d5bc8-25b3-a7ab-f07d-501d511648aa/90108973-c845-45d9-8d26-f789d246e164_Rever_v5_iOS_2208x1242-4.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3f/87/2f/3f872faa-2399-1905-ce4a-30de4acb04ed/7072d01e-5767-46ef-b252-c53c77f7613c_Rever_v5_iOS_2208x1242-5__U00281_U0029.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f6/62/b1/f662b12d-da0b-379b-956c-49b09140a0d8/efa6a771-4546-4545-869f-07056b133a34_Rever_v5_iOS_2208x1242-6.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/86/55/f3/8655f352-4f55-323a-6795-bcbc20ca4458/da404094-8fb7-4d49-a6a2-31df7cd09a1e_Rever_v5_iOS_2208x1242-7.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ba/64/60/ba6460c6-4e33-296f-f893-c3feb4c2b4fe/f21ff170-1608-4b27-ad65-688db16c247f_Rever_v5_iOS_2208x1242-8.jpg/406x228bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Better workes with internet but used it it without to. Helps to get to the spots, shows directions and its easy to mark spots you are intereseted in on map. | Great app | Creates lists (which I can do anywhere) and provides a basis map which doesn't work as well as google maps and doesn't show the items on your list. So what is the point? I think they wanted to show a map with the items you had selected to visit, but the feature doesn't work. I don't have anymore time to waste on it. | Couldn't find my Hilton hotel, no transport info | You can save cities to your iPhone, so you can view info or a map without wifi. | Our son recommended this app for our Vienna trip.  It's convenient and very easy to use.  I don't need worry about how much data were used because it didn't need wifi.  Best of all, it's free.  Thanks. | Assumed I could get good paper maps while in Vienna like I could 30 years ago. Guess what you can't. We struggled for two days before we found this app. Combines streets, points of interest and best of all public transportation routes! Has all the detail needed. 

Great app! | Such a useful app-- a real lifesaver at times. You can access the maps offline, though don't forget to download them before you travel. | So easy to use. Doesn't take a lot of space or battery. | Usually don't rate apps but after a trip to Europe using this offline maps, I can asure you, this app will make your trip easier and you won't miss any important spot in the city. I used London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Rome, Florence, Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon! In Budapest I felt lost because they don't have a map for this city but Google also doesn't have a map for Budapest offline. 
I'll put 6 stars but I can't so 5 it's the closest. One more thing, all this is for FREE! And this is not all, also you can download the information about the historic places in the city and then you can get the info offline. 
You have to try it!! | This app was very useful navigating the streets of Vienna. | I downloaded the Ulmon guide for four cities in preparation for a recent trip to Europe: Munich Prague Vienna and Amsterdam. You can drop pins, actually stars on places that you're interested in visiting including sites restaurants hotels etc. The off-line maps are fantastic and the articles helpful. I tend to keep my phone on airplane mode when I am out of the United States this app was fantastic because I was able to use the map even when I wasn't in Wi-Fi. Download the guides before you go on your trip if possible this way you can read and save articles but if you don't download it until you're there that's fine too. | Great way to see and get around Vienna | Very good app, but could be better if they put tram and metro maps like in London | Used to be great until now (latest version): An annoying  banner ad takes away 20% of screen area.... | I've used this App in Paris (different version for each city) and Vienna. It works well and I've come to depend on it. I would like to see more cities added (going to Budapest next and they don't have a version yet). | Preload your destinations and you are all set for days of sight seeing. You can also track those pesky cabbies and make sure they are not taking the long way around | I travel a lot but I am also directionally challenged. The apps link the metro station with any places on the map, which is a very useful feature. | Amazing app! | There is nothing bad I can say about this map. I would even pay for it! I downloaded it before I hopped on the plane for Vienna and it saved me by having the map available offline--and, it was accurate! It has been the best tool I have had here as a traveler! | Great app for walking/running through the city. It locates you offline and is super responsive when magnifying. Many sites, restaurants and shops are listed. Would love the next update to allow you to tag a site as seen or to see. | This app was invaluable in finding my way around Vienna while off-line. I wish the subway lines were a little easier to read on the map. | This is a great app and set of apps. Usable without wifi or cell coverage. Used extensively for street locations. Search does not recognize parks or other types of open spaces unless they are really popular tourist spots. | I used the Vienna, London and Paris guides. Loved them. Intelligently designed. Fast and beautiful interface. Full of useful info. I wish they become ""The Guide"" for travelers. | Very good app to get you around and has all the info you would ever need. | The map is fully useable offline; mysteriously, it is even able to track your location. (I had no service in Austria, so I know I was offline. I also kept it in airplane mode to avoid weird charges.) 
Plus, all the major monuments have articles which are also accessible offline. | This app has great offline features that guided me around Vienna for 3 days with out getting lost! This was a great supplement to my guide book and maps. The offline wiki was great for self walking tours. The offline map is an absolute must for any traveler and this app covers the most common tourist attractions you'd visit. The Ubahn and tram stops are so helpful for getting around. | app is a great help but the search is poorly done | Realy great app! We spent week at Vienna and we had found everything what we wanted. The best thing is, that it is offline and you can save data and places which you want to visit in the future. I reccomend it to any Vienna tourist :) | Used this a ton to get around. Amazing because iPhone 5 (maybe others) has gps even when on airplane mode and not connected to wifi.  Loved this offline!! | What a great resource! I don't even carry a map any more.  Plus, the ability to make an account and link my Pins & Bookmarks between iPad & iPhone adds to the convenience. | It's very useful!!! | Used this app in Vienna and would have been lost without it. I didn't realize until the last day that you could click on a site and it would give lots of useful information. Awesome app that works without Internet. Wouldn't travel without this app to Vienna. | Needed an off line map! | It is a really great app for tourists. I have one sugestion to add turn by turn navigation. And you can also add map of public transport info into description how to get to selected destination. | The guide is comprehensive, and the maps were helpful because we could access them online. I'd suggest adding directions (shortest and fastest routes, etc.). Overall, a very good guide. | The App has very convenient feature to let you select a destination and then puts it right on the map. | We used both Vienna and Paris apps on our recent vacation. We used them constantly and won't travel without them in the future. | Excellent and really helpful! | Really excellent and comprehensive guide. Pin feature and offline capabilities make it a must have for a trip to Wien! | I used this app for planning the Vienna visit. Dropped pins on places we wished to see and then planned the days and routes. Great, useful app. | This was our first time in Vienna but we felt like we have been there many times with this extremely useful easy to use and friendly app I recommended to everybody | We have used this app constantly offline for our week in Vienna. It is better and more convenient than any paper map or other app(we tried others) that we have seen. It shows public transport and even trails. We used it in the central area and in the woods. We did not turn on data roaming but If you did it would be even more spectacular. A local SIM card in an unlocked phone would be very nice with this. | Since the historical content is just links to Wikipedia sites, you need an Internet data plan (or a wifi spot) to make use of this app. Plus, the map is slow to load and difficult to use. | It good and usefufull app | Easy to use. | Still adjusting to using effectively, but shows potential.  Appreciate effort - THANKS | Getting ready to leave on a trip to Vienna.  This app has made my planning much easier. | Tenia mis dudas pero es muy practico y mucho mejor que las versiones gratuitas. Si costeo lo que pague.

ABOUT SHAKA GUIDE
At Shaka Guide our goal is to connect people with places. We love Hawaii. Not just for its beauty, but also for its rich history and culture. We believe that every destination has a story and we want to tell it. In Hawaii, we have over 20 audio tours that do just that — share the stories of the islands.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/12/37/aa/1237aa05-e17c-643d-4ba6-ca6f3c5559df/AppIcon-Kauai-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-10-0-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","156579840","12.0","2016-06-20T21:23:07Z","2024-04-26T12:56:35Z","Bug fixes and improvements","8.3.3",0,"USD",true,1275283409,"Shaka Guide","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/shaka-guide/id1275283409?uo=4","http://www.ShakaGuide.com",4.84124,"We had a wonderful time on this tour. You can tailor it to your own pace and activity level. The ""tour guide"" was informative and entertaining. We decided to purchase the entire package option. Highly recommend! | Excellently described tour | This is about the third time or fourth that we’ve used this tour in the continental United States and Hawaii and we love it. Great job. | First time on Kauai . Ran across this app . Have used it for three days and it really helps finding nice places. Very informative. | I enjoyed the app and the voice talking. Only thing I would change is time to tell when turns are coming up….. needed a little more notice then 30 seconds | To much to do. Great insight and stories of the island. Did most of the 4. Great value great fun. Highly recommended. | This is our second trip using the Shaka Guide apps, and they’re worth their weight in gold. Hours of sightseeing and exploration, great recommendations, history and context for what you’re seeing, and the flexibility to go at your own pace and edit the tour to your needs. Easily at the quality level of most in-person guided tours I’ve been on, with the only real drawback being that you can’t chat or ask questions with the guide - but the low price and high flexibility more than make up for it. Absolutely recommend! | The tour was easy to navigate and the narrator was very entertaining!! The GPS worked well. Will definitely use this service again 😎 | I’m a fan of this tour app. Used on Oahu, Big Island and Kauai. So informative and easy to use. Great little tidbits of information and good suggestions for eating and activities. Some corny jokes, but that’s makes it interesting. | These guys are going to disrupt the guided tour industry. Our concierge recommended the app after we got canceled out of a tour and it was a blessing in disguise. We used for four Shaka tours on our Hawaii trip on two islands, the Shaka guide completely enhanced and completed our trip. The app is like having a seasoned and interesting guide with you at all times while also giving you the freedom to navigate your own trip all at once. Ten out of ten. | We used the app over a day and a half to visit a great deal of Kaua’i in our time here.    You can customize what you visit to fit your schedule if on a timeline, which we did.    We enjoyed the history and tips of where to stop along the way! | This has been the best trip to Kauai! We have been able to see so much that we never would have known about if we hadn’t gotten the Shaka Kauai app! We purchased the 4 pack of tours and used them all! Our favorite was the North Shore Kauai tour. We plan to go to Oahu on Thursday and we will be getting those tours as well. Aloha! | Even though it was a bit of a rainy day, we thoroughly enjoyed the tour. The Hawaiian music, the local information, the history! We’ll be using Shaka Guides whenever we travel, if they are available where we travel! | Used this app for a drive up to the north shore of Kaua’i.  So glad we did.  Great directions and really good narration and tips.  I also liked the historical info we got. | Excellent tour and so interesting and clear to understand! | Though we are mobility limited seniors, we are tech savvy. After comparing this to other purchase candidates, we bought thinking our version of Shaka was tour vs. trail focused. Not so. I can’t tell you how frustrated we were, time after time when at each trail, we were told what we’d see just beyond sight, 1/3 mile, a 30 minute walk, etc. if we couldn’t see it already, we knew we couldn’t get there. If up hill / down hill, even worse, even if we could see it. To add insult to injury, the guide asked how we had enjoyed the view after we drove by without stopping. Really!?!

Worst of all, we wasted half of our available light trying to get to the starting point of our tour, getting more & more frustrated at the endless music without a bit of narration. Most frustrating of all, somehow our requested tour of Waimea Canyon somehow morphed into a north shore tour, & the app never told us we were NEVER going to arrive at the starting point unless we turned around. (If it had, we could have gotten our direction & hoped-for tour in sync much earlier.) Only when we stopped some time after the expected tour start & expanded the map to see what was going on did we discover the problem. We had started from Kapaa Shore & expected the narration to start somewhere on the way to Lawai. Nothing happened. 

2 suggestions.  
1) The 4-tour package has info almost anywhere we go. Why not give it to us as we travel, on or off a tour?
2) If we select a tour, why not tell us to start it, then help us navigate to the tour starting point? (We got no such help & set google maps to go to the starting point ourselves.) | I found this in my own and was worried it might be cheesy. Nope! It was incredible. So many times we would see something that made us want to stop but we'd say, ""wait ... he didn't say to stop there."" And then a few minutes later ... BAM! There's the right place to stop and soak up some incredible natural beauty. The stories are great. They complement the stories told on other tours. The setup is great. You can turn it on and just drive ... or you can plan a morning or afternoon around filling all the steps as if it is a true tour. Flexible and awesome. We really loved it. Don't think twice. Worth every penny. | The app was incredibly helpful! We learned a ton about the islands we visited. Had fun along the way! My sister in law highly recommended and it was worth it! | Downloaded this app for time in Kauai. The Wailua Valley and Waterfall tour worked perfectly. Enjoyed the tour and stops. I could not get the speaking audio to work on the Poipu and Kola tour. The music worked but when the speaking would start it would pause and I could not get it to restart. Tried force closing the app, restarting the phone, disconnecting from Apple CarPlay. Nothing worked. Ended up giving up on that tour. Had it worked, the app would be 5 stars. | I traveled solo in Kauai for a few days and the driving tours were the best! I never had to worry about parking in Waimea Canyon or feeling lost. Highly recommend for anyone traveling in Hawaii! | A must have for your road trip !! | We were first introduced to the Shaka app while visiting Maui. The road to Hana was amazing. So during this family trip to Kauai, we decided to download this app. My son named the tour guide “George.” “George” took us through some amazing locations in Kauai and we heard so many wonderful stories. There’s so much to do and see in this island. Highly recommend! | The information provided is fine. But I wanted to throw my phone out the window every time I tried to get it to work and wasted precious vacation time. Even with good Wi-Fi at the hotel, I couldn’t get downloading to start. It wasn’t the Wi-Fi. The app just wouldn’t respond. I’d press it over and over and it would just “think” then do nothing. Turned off phone, shut down app, closed everything on my phone, MORE than enough storage on my phone…and nothing.

 Finally after an hour or two I had three of the four I paid for downloaded. So we left. Then in the car trying to start a tour and it wouldn’t start 😤 THEN it suddenly said I still needed to download them!! I have gotten one to work so far. I’m not going to sit on the side of the road for hours trying to download AGAIN. I’d love the info, but time is too precious on vacation. Too expensive for the hassle. | We’ve bought this app for each of the islands and haven’t been disappointed. Each tour gives some fun history and tidbits that we probably wouldn’t have known about had we just driven around. And we didn’t pay an absolute fortune for it. That said, here are a couple of things to know but not to discourage you from purchasing. 
1. The narrator is great but it sure would’ve been nice if they could have a different voice for each tour, just for a little variety. 
2. In the years since these first came out, changes have happened. The Ishihara store in Waimea is closing in March 2023 so that’s off. The archaeological site in Poipu is kind of blocked by a large screen on the right and can be easy to miss. 
3. When he tells you to turn right down a dirt road in Poipu, it’s been paved. Don’t be confused. 
4. Kauai can be rainy. Try to look over or get a forecast of Waimea Canyon before driving up. Clouds settle in the canyon so views will be obscured. Consider bringing a hoodie and decent hiking shoes. Slippahs are slippery on the red mud. Trust me. 
5. Finally, the app can be a bit clunky to use, especially when getting to the starting point, but once you’re there it’s pretty easy to just follow along. Just have fun with it and Live Aloha. | My husband and I just spent two weeks in Hawaii and used these guides. They were great. Guided us to all the “need to see” spots and filled us in on lots of information and history. I highly recommend. We used the guides for Oahu, Maui, Hawaii (The Big Island) and Kauai. | Should be required listening for anyone that visits the islands.  Shaka Guide No Ka Oi! | This is the best way to see the island! The directions are  easy to follow, the stories and history are interesting. I’ve learned so much about Kauai!  I highly recommend all the tours. You won’t be disappointed 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 | I have never | This was the best tour I have done and it is perfectly priced. There were so many picture opportunities, cool beaches, awesome caves, beautiful waterfalls. 10/10 would recommend. For the price you would spend on a guided tour with someone driving you, you can spend on a car for the week with to explore the entire island. | This is a great way to see mostly everything on the island. The whole family enjoyed this and while we live in Hawaii on Oahu we learned a thing or two about Hawaiian culture. Navigation and locations are easy to find with the apps details and instructions. Highly recommend doing this! | We found these guides during our stopover on Oahu. They’re like a hop-on/hop-off bus tour but at your own pace. | The best app, don’t go to Hawaii without it!! See everything you want to see and learn more than you could ever without hiring the best guides. #lethawaiihappen | We loved everything about this app. Completed three of the four tours, and had a blast on every tour. We encountered so many places we would have never heard of otherwise. We look forward to completing the fourth on our next vacation (and probably repeating the others). Definitely worth the price of admission. | Got us lost.     Ended tour when we started driving. | We have used this app in both Maui and Kauai and could not love it more. So helpful! | A friend who used this app recommended it to us and I wholeheartedly agree. It made the drive around Kauai really enjoyable and pointed out so many things along the way we never would have thought to stop at otherwise. The GPS is amazingly accurate. Usually with driving guides, they tell you where to go and then you have to navigate yourself there and hit “play” on the app. Not with the Shaka guide! It knows where you are and plays fun background music while you drive and then automatically starts the guide when you get to the right spot. So if you’re stuck in traffic, or take a wrong turn, you don’t have to worry about getting off-sync with the tour. Amazing! The content is really fun and good for all ages. The stories, history and legends are really interesting, and we found ourselves using some of their catchphrases during our trip, eh brah?! | I really like the KAUA’I tour but tried to use it about 3 weeks ago and it wouldn’t work. So I went to the website and went through the procedure to reset it and it looked like it was successful. So I tried to use it today about two weeks later and had a lot of trouble and finally got it going after a half an hour. I’m wondering if the heavy cloud cover and light rain could be the reason. | I have been to Kauai over 15 times in 22 years.  I can’t believe I didn’t know about this until now!  Excellent, user friendly, you can go at you own pace, stop at all or none of the highlighted places, turn on and off as you wish.  We had no problem downloading the 4 trip options, and the tour automatically started when we were in range of the first starting point (turn the app on of course), with sound through our rental car speakers, when we connected the phone via usb.  We did the Wailua falls tour yesterday because we had never done the Fern Grotto boat ride, and we loved it!  Highly recommended!!! | This was a great way to experience the island of Kauai. It worked great on the phone and there were no issues. My only wish is that it would support apple car play and android auto to aid in the navigation.

Thank You for the Great Experience | Wow. No way we could have done everything without this app. We looked ahead and picked and chose what we wanted to do. Over 3 days we did all 4 driving tours in Kauai and covered the entire island. We skipped things we didn’t feel the need to do. We learned more and saw more than we could have with us navigating ourselves. Highly highly highly recommend this so much! | I used for my 6 day stay in Kauai. I found it Highly valuable audio guide for driving around to visit all interesting parts of Kauai. I liked the fact that it picked the location using GPS and started guiding from wherever I was.
I found a challenge to setup as Apple Carplay would kickin automatically and interfere with Guide's audio. Also the guide doesn't pickup your location if you are driving in reverse direction.
Overall, wonderful resource, well worth what I apid for. Thanks for interesting stories and cultural background. | Purchase the Shaka guide and you will not need anything more. Numerous stories, directions, food recs,Restroom breaks and more all through this amazing narration. | Great app, worked awesome. Narrator was funny and made the trip fun and entertaining! Will purchase for the other islands. | Our second island and our second Shaka guided trip. Cannot stop raving about it. You guys were spot on with the beaches and the rides throughout. Never needed to ask for directions. Never felt more at home than when riding along and listening to the guide take us back in time and into the spirits of the land and people of Kauaii. 

Tip: there were a few small stops (food/retail) that have since changed hands. Might wanna go back out and refresh some of these suggestions. Id pay for the update!! | We love the self guided driving tour good information and easy to follow step-by-step guides. Definitely check it out | Planned a last minute trip to Kauai and have to thank this app for making the trip so amazing and stress free. Really felt like we got a feel for the whole island with all 4 tours and can’t recommend this app enough. So easy to customize your trip and pick and choose the stops you want and the stories along the drive are great. Extremely well designed app and it’s like having a private guide of the island with you at all time- beyond worth it for $30! | I have used this app at 2 islands Kaui and Honolulu. I love that it’s self paced and you can stop as long as you want in any stop. | This is an absolute must if you are vacationing in Kauai!!  We only intended to do one tour & loved it soooo much we ended up doing all 4!  We would have missed so much if we hadn’t have had this app! | Enjoyed all tours very much.  For people who prefer to travel their own paths it was perfect. Got to see so many spots and beaches which we would have never found on are own.  Enjoyed informational stories, historic folk tales and driving hints to be safe.  First used Shaka when traveled to Mauii, so was first thing we did when getting ready for Kauai .  Would highly recommend for someone traveling to the Islands Aloha! | What a great idea, thank you Shaka Guide. We really enjoyed all four tours of Kaiuai. Thanks to the app we discovered many beaches and trails and sites we would not have found on our own. With luck will be coming back later this year and downloading more Shaka guides for another island. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

The second time was better than the first. Learned more as I caught things I missed the first time.

They thrive on people panic booking and booking travel/events too soon with no cancellation policy. They will just take your money and run. No forgiveness or flexibility is given to rebook and even if they say they “will look into it” you will never hear from them again. I even offered to take “credits” to rebook the same travel and still nothing. | This app will show you results for hotels in Tokyo with what seems like very good prices but every hotel that I wanted to book, the app would say that there was 1 room left but then when you go to book, it would show no more rooms available. Repeat the search and the same hotels come up again. The app is a complete waste of time for booking hotels in Japan. Use booking.com or Agoda. Much better apps that only show you hotels that are available at time of search. | Easy to buy and quick to redeem. | We are very excited and happy | I’ve booked 3 different experiences around Thailand and the Philippines- amazing 🤩 | Klook is an excellent app to have while traveling in Asia. | great app | Never ever go with Klook. I had a really bad experience with KLOOK. I purchased ticket for Langkawi Cable Car. But the ticket could not be printed and I tried to reach Klook but they did not response. I had to purchase again from counter.  I asked for a refund and  they refused and did not say why this happened | I used Klook to by eSIM for my trip to China. I set delivery date for my departure date and I still have not received the voucher. I am testing to reach customer support, but they do not respond promptly. I had to wait for 1 hr to get a response. When the support stated talking to me I see the notifications but I do not see their messages in the support chat. Very broken app. They say I will be able to get my voucher in the app, but I do m not see anything. I feel I am being scammed. Very unhappy. | This app is a great way to obtain tickets to a wide range of events, trips, and a lot more! | This app work flawless and helpful. | I was looking to book the Shinkansen reservation and came across this app. It was easy to find which day, what time and where the stations are to take the train. I will recommend everyone to use this to book their next Shinkansen reservation, | Stay away from this Klook App! Purchased a private car transfer from Kansai Airport in Osaka and we waited over a hour with no driver anywhere around to pick us up but there were many others around with cards shown for other riders. Klook support is only by chat unlike others where you can call a US Number and after wasting lots of time in chat they say the driver doesn’t answer his phone. We eventually had to catch a taxi for a higher price and later received a email from Klook saying that the driver said he was there waiting for us which was a total scam. They wouldn’t issue a immediate refund so we were forced to contact our credit card company and submit a refund claim. Stay away from Klook like the plague! | We used Klook extensively for booking experiences and hotels for our trip to Taiwan. Everything went smoothly and the prices were good too. | I was hesitant at first but I've booked multiple visits so far and everything ran smooth and at a great price too! I plan to use Klook more for my next trip! | Been using this app for years without any problems.will continue to use it for all my Japan trips and will continue to recommend to others | I don’t understand how a website does not offer any kind of support or help for its users or customers!! Haven’t heard of AI, I guess!! They are more interested in just taking your money, then you’re damned!!! My bad for listening to other raving reviews that are now totally useless!!! It would help to have a feminist touch…😱😱 | We’ve used Klook for 2 different locations so far. It has been so easy to book tickets and get the vouchers sent directly to us. We will continue to use Klook as much as possible for every adventure we go on! | Horrible service and no customer assistance with this app, they just leave you out to dry as soon as you pay!! | HORRIBLE. They let me book and experience for 2 hours away from where i stay on Wednesday for a Sunday, confirmed the booking, and send me my confirmation number. So I book travel for the day, and make arrangements. Then Saturday night they cancelled via email to say it’s overbooked. AVOID AT ALL COSTS | This app is worse than useless. I booked a tour, paid money, then found out 4 days later there was no availability. And since I was counting on this “booking” all the companies have since sold out as well.

Now get to wait for my money to be returned, for a booking that never existed in the fist place. And of course Klook kept their cut “Klook upgrades cannot be refunded”. So they just took $10 from me on top of everything else. 

There are better apps that do the same thing, but come through. Don’t use | I was having problems purchasing tickets to Disneyland website and the app with issue with my debit card and when my cousin send me this app, it was so quick and fast. Now I don’t have to stress about it anymore. Well done Klook!!! | I was worried I was not able to use my ticket voucher for the next day, but help center syamimi was able to help me and informed me that I can use the voucher until May 18, 2024. Great job on the customer service! | To whom it may concern.

On the klook app I have noticed a few times with several different airlines when you add the flight number for example TG404 and my flight is tomorrow it changes the date of my flight airport transportation from March 26 to the flight today on March 25. They use the same flight numbers both days. It would be nice if the date not change.
Thank you. I lost money because of this. | First time user of the app.  I made a mistake traveling to Tokyo making reservations.  No help what so ever.  My transaction is still pending after i noticed the error on my part and contacted them within 15 mins of waiting in a que.  I thought this app would be great to use.  After i use the tickets i previously purchased it will get deleted. To many other apps that have better customer service. | I book basically everything for our trips on Klook. We get to discover new adventures that we may have not have even learned about without it. It saves time on queues too. Thank you Klook | Easy to use and the savings are significant! Refunds are painless and the app gives great suggestions on fun things to do! | from end-to-end this service is awful. terrible interface, completely unclear directions, complete lack of warnings like not being able to book same-day tickets, and then totally unhelpful customer service. thanks for wasting several hours of my life trying to use this ridiculous app and service | Easy to access essential promotion deal in the visited area and great customer service! Highly recommend people use their service especially traveling Asia | KLOOK is the way to go if you want to organize your trip in advance. It is easy to book and no hussle since you bought your tickets in n advance! Thanks , KLOOK! | Site is user friendly for an old dog like me 🐶 | I find the app extremely easy to use | Great service. | Although this app has a lot of good deals they also allow shady businesses apart of their app. We booked a hotel room stay for one night and on my statement it said I check in March 3rd and check out March 4th. We get to the hotel and the front desk tells us we only have the room for 2 hours and wants to upcharge us but on my statement it clearly says that I am booked for march 3rd check in and check out March 4th. The receptionist leaves to the back and never comes back out so we can’t even talk to anyone. We wait over 2 hours to speak to someone while also trying to get ahold of Klook only for them to tell us they can’t refund us because it’s the day of and my mistake.. What do you mean ??? We wasted 2 hours waiting to speak to the receptionist at the hotel and used ZERO of their services and they continue to allow business like this on their app. Be CAREFUL. | Lies and false information from Klook and then no refund. | As expected I sent them the whole story of what’s happened in the link they pretended to provide (like they care). Nope! over a week after, nothing happens, not even an acknowledge or pretend like they are working on the case. Truly, a sad customer support! Previous: This was my first time using Klook, as they seem popular in Asia. I booked a car rental, but in the confirmation email, it stated that refunds were not available on the day of the rental. I attempted to cancel my reservation one day prior, but Klook refused to issue a refund and instead suggested to a full charge. Unfortunately, there was no clear explanation about refund policies or fees prior to the rental date. Despite multiple attempts to contact their call center, I was never given a satisfactory answer about the language used in the confirmation email or why a refund was not possible, the reps were just simply “no refund, bye” and didn’t bother to read my further questions. | I just used klook to schedule airport pickup in Hanoi, VN.  The site asked me for my flight info but didn’t realize it set the date for Feb 27 default (that’s tomorrow).  I needed the pickup for March 9th.  I realized the mistake and engaged them immediately.  They said there’s nothing they can do to cancel.  There is a 24 hour before pickup free cancellation but due to Vietnam being 12 hours ahead of the US, I was already within that 24 hour before I ever booked because of the auto date they set.  

This is a terrible way to do business. And I will not be using them again. | Very easy to navigate and all the tours we had are perfect. | Very easy to navigate thru the app. A one stop for all your train rides and experiences to purchase tickets and have all your information in one place. | I couldn’t find the booking confirmation on my email. I asked for help from Klook live chat. Muhammad A found my booking information and resent it to me. I still couldn’t locate it on the inbox. He sent me a pdf attachment with the live chat so that I could download it. He is one of the best costumer specialist I have luckily had! Thank you Muhammad! | 台灣人是不習慣當面給小費的。有些導遊也不自在提小費，可以學Uber,在review 裏或付款裏加要不要給小費。我以前買伴手禮要送導遊，他都不收的。 | Nice | This software has engaged in false marketing and fraud in Chinese region.
1. The coupon grabbing activity does not disclose the number of discounted spots.
2. At the time of grabbing discounts, the server failure will be displayed immediately, and then the activity will be displayed as ended. | I received it immediately. | No contact number to call, email or chat online. Had a problem with my train ticket voucher voucher. Was not able to use it! Will dispute with my Visa card! | Can’t do without Klook when traveling abroad. | 我喜欢在klook 上寻找旅行项目，价格比较合理 | Best travel APP you can find | Customer support was very courteous and helpful. Sindhu N. assisted me with a refund when I mistakenly booked the wrong month. | I wasn’t able to check out using 3 of the 4 payment methods I tried. Then none of the codes I had, not yet express also didn’t work!

I don’t see a single thing that’s not readily available online. Absolutely not a competitor to AllTrails | Used to use this app for info on parks, what to do etc. Now I go thru pages of stuff, it requires location and notifications. 
Sorry to see this good app go down the tubes. I’ve deleted it. | I got this app for my first camping trip, and I signed up for the free trial and forgot to cancel it before it charged me. I had planned to switch to a cheaper option, but forgot! I email the company and Kerry replied. He was very kind, understood my situation, and helped guide me through cancelling my payment. I plan to keep a less costly subscription for this app, just because the Creator was so kind!
As for the usability of the app, I found it very helpful with planning hikes and for navigation. I can tell the Creator put a lot of thought into creating this app. 5 stars!!! | The free NPS app has very similar content on a much easier to use platform… and did I mention free? 

The adds for this app were deceiving to make it seem like these guides were free, or at least affordable. But $19.99 per month to access park travel guides, which is what is advertised, is very overpriced. Based on other subscribers’ reviews of the paid content, I’ll pass. Without the $19.99/month subscription, the app offers little to no functionality and is not worth the used space on your phone! Do yourselves a favor and download the NPS app. 

I’ll also add that the developers’ response to some of these reviews and the active deception and hiding of their fees makes me question the morality of the developer… yet another reason why I’m not willing to risk $19.99 to give the paid version a shot. I hope you will also think twice before paying the developer! | Paid for the subscription. Verified that I’m subscribed but it freezes every time that I try to download the map for offline usage and then prompts me to “start 3 day trial” and then just repeats that I’m already subscribed. Shame. | I got excited after reading Nikon’s photography challenge. However, when I downloaded the app, they wanted $19.99/month! I do not go to enough parks for that kind of money. It was a little less for 3 months, but still an expensive regular fee. I’m not asking for anything for free, but this was too much for my budget. Best of luck to them. It looks like it would be a cool way to track park experiences. | The free NPS app has the same content, including links to nearby parks/monuments/trails without adding extra unnecessary information. You can also save the NPS parks for offline use. I mean, if you’d like to waste at least $19.99 per month, this is an option, I guess. EDIT: The developer responded, saying I’m putting out misinformation…that the PARK TRAVEL GUIDE app only costs money if you want to access PARK TRAVEL GUIDES. So, thank you Chimani for verifying what I wrote. You DO charge a minimum of $19.99/mo to use the primary functions of your app. LOL EDIT 2: Chimani removed their comment about “misinformation” and changed their claims YET AGAIN. I don’t trust a developer who keeps moving the goalposts and using doublespeak to hide their fees. | Very useful,with interesting content | The “updated” version completely changed all the features that made this a fantastic app and now it’s almost useless.  The previous map was great: you could sort by type of national park property (or just view them all) and easily see visited vs. unvisited sites. Yes, I’ve had communications as to how I’m supposed to still be able to do something similar, but let’s be honest, it doesn’t come even close to the functionality of the previous version. Oh so sad. I seldom use the app anymore. | Was using this app for nearly 4 years and visited majority of the US while traveling for work. Perfect features for visiting monuments, preserves to National Parks. Absolutely loved this app. 

Once the new upgrade happened, it’s simple features became a hinderance. Factoring in the pay feature, they had a great system going till they messed it up. 

Hard to imagine messing up a mayonnaise sandwich but I guess anything is possible. | The information provided by this app is generic and not very helpful for selecting somewhere to visit and figuring out what to do there. I think you are better off visiting nps.gov and the many excellent travel blogs for actual useful information. There are more specialized apps that are much more useful for hiking. There is something cheap and tawdry about the app’s gamification of visiting national parks, as well as the ads appearing on most screens.

UPDATE: I did look at the guides and they are hard to use. Typically, you have a map with many points but few labels, so it’s hard to know or remember what you are looking at. You can also see lists of hikes, waterfalls, et cetera, but there’s no way to put together a coherent picture or plan. Information can be out of date, e.g., the Grove of the Patriarchs at Mt. Ranier is closed with no re-opening date. | If I want to record a past visit you can’t record multiple days at once with drag and drop…would be much easier if you could. | Why did you screw up the map?  I liked to be able to easily see which parks I had been to in an area.  Bring that back!!! | Just like ALL the recent reviews I’m so upset they ruined one of the Best apps for national Parks.  This app helped us visit 46 national Parks and now it’s trash. It completely wiped all the tracking we had in place. The map to find parks near you is gone and now they show way to much on the maps so you can’t actually find the 63 NPs.  

I can’t understand why they would take something so good and put out this crap.  Look at your user reviews since the update they are all 1 star. 

Bring back the original app!!! | This was the absolute best app for tracking National Parks / Monuments etc. Then the changed the mapping data and its a giant steaming pile of hot garbage now. Sad, I really loved this app. | I am not happy at all with the new version, I will never use guides , you took away the map of the US showing each park and the ones I have already visited a different color. You would simply click on the park and would get a description and another click would take you directly to the National Park page, I wished you would change this app back , I cannot see using this app anymore | Every time I click on Utah it goes to West Virginia. I kinda have an idea of what’s in the state, but I would also like to see what’s there and see the info of what’s in the state for any park weather it state  or National. | For years this has been my go-to national park app. I even bought the lifetime subscription. Ever since the last update to “improve” their app it’s straight garbage. Please roll back to the old version until you find developers that can actually build a good UI. The current version isn’t even a beta version. Please fix this or honestly I’d like a refund on my subscription. Back to the NPS app for me. | I signed up for the app to get the discounts but there is no information on the app about how to use them. I think the discounts are on the web interface but sometimes they say to use a “promo code” to get them and then other times mention a “Chimani perks card” which I never received. Anyone know this? | I have been using this app since it was started and now … ugh. What happened to the maps? I used to be able to hike in a park, open the map and see where I was. I have told so many lost hikers about this app, but now I can’t even find the map. What happened?? | Really dissatisfied with the recent update. Previously it was great to be able to see what Parks you’d visited by type on one of the many map layers that you could select from. | This app makes it impossible to unsubscribe. | No idea how to reach you; tried app support with no luck.   I have been an extremely heavy user of chimani for several years…and loved it.   Now, I neeed to go through multiple steps to load the map…and there doesn’t seem to be a way to display all the park sites without you grouping them…again, anotherstep I have to go through.  Please, can I have my old simple app back? | Why would you take what was a good app, and turn it into this?!?!  The new map is horrible and the app is much worse now in general | My favorite part of the original app was the way I could sort categories on a map.  I could see what is in the area while I was traveling.  It would also change the graphic colors on parks I have visited on the maps.  This version requires me to know the name of a park before I look up the information.  I hate this new version.  I have been to 50 national Parks & they only appear on a list.  Even worse the update no longer recognizes I paid for the guides. | Every time I switch to my Google Notes app to look up the date I visited a park, this app forces me to log back in and go through the process of finding the park that I was updating. So frustrating! | I’ve been using this app since it started and love it! I track all of my trips and have recorded my past trips, and the guides are helpful. | And the stamp locations? | I tried to find out terms of use for renewals, etc, but the app makes this simple function impossible. Still trying to find this basic user info page after 20 mins. I don’t want to “auto-renew” as I only plan to use this app for a certain trip in 2021. So... this app lost cred with me right away. | I’ve had Chimani for years and bought a lifetime membership in 2018. Their customer service is outstanding!  Kerry has helped me with a complicated subscription issue and worked everything out for me. I now have one account with all my info. Can’t wait to use it on our big upcoming trip! | I recently started using the Chimani National Park app and I love it! Very helpful information and a great tool for planning trips to parks we want to visit. Wish I had known about this app years ago. Can’t wait for more state parks to be added. | I paid 29.99 and didn’t get anything???? What a waste of money, I want Apple to refund my $$ for this app purchase!! | It’s a sad  you are forcing people to a subscription model. I Bought the Smoky mountain app and now it will not be supported anymore. | Trails are only visible when zoomed in so far one cannot get the big picture. 
Also it would be nice to be able to highlight individual trails since otherwise it is hard to see which trail is which when there are many intersections | Why doesn’t the app show the gateway arch or Indiana Dunes as national parks yet? | I use tons of apps, but rarely do reviews, but, with such exemplary support, I have to do this review. 
There was a small problem with my account, caused by me, and they happily rectified it lightning quick. 
I love supporting worthy developers. Thanks! | It might be a good app if you spend the $30 a year subscription, but the free app is worthless.

I wish that in the description the App developer was clear about the subscription costs.  Many apps have a free version that has some things, but this free version is useless

The information you get is absolutely not worth the price of this subscription. All of it you could easily get online or from the literature at the entrance gate of national parks. | Wouldn't store park info before. Now they charge a ridiculous fee for info that can be had for free from other sources. I have deleted this app. | There is absolutely no redeeming feature of this app. The parks themselves provide better and more insight than this ripoff. They stole $30 from me, DO NOT let this happen to you! A complete waste of storage space. | Not free at all.  Will not let you try it out unless you have either sufficient funds on apple store for full year or credit card  on file with apple | I’ve been using this app for many years and find it incredibly useful!  There are a few little things that have been identified in other reviews, so I’m not going to repeat them.  This app is well worth having and using if you frequent the National Parks - especially if you hike into the parks, beyond the parking lots and congestion.  I spend a lot of time on remote trails, and some not so remote.  There have been several times this app helped me find my way back after a long day on a confusing trail system. I always carry a paper map (as a backup), but there’s nothing like being able to view your location on a downloaded map of the trail system!  Btw, I even carry a small solar panel to charge my phone.
As with most apps, you MUST use it and familiarize yourself with it to fully benefit from its many features. | This app is great for planning national park trips! I’ve used it on my last five and it always gives great tips and ideas. Download it! | I would pay a small fee but I don’t want the hassle of. Setting up a subscription and canceling etc. just make it an in app purchase and be done with it | best app for traveling to canyons. | The app work fine on my android phone, but I am unable to download Park guides on the iPad app. | This used to be a free 5 star app. Then they changed their model to a rather expensive pay-for basis. In the meantime I have loaded years of info covering some 37 National Parks and I am now locked out of that data because they now insist I pay a fee to look at MY DATA!

I’m pretty angry. Not because they need to charge money for what is a pretty good app but they didn't give me chance to get my data or give me free access to the parks I’d already been to (and provided them info on). My data made this app better but I’m locked out of it. So when did I go to the Talus Cave at Pinnacles NP, or hike Wheeler Peak at Great Basin? | This app is not user friendly. I paid for the year and I can’t figure out the trip planning. I downloaded the minimal map and the other one that was supposed to be more detailed, they were the same. This app is a waste of money. | Why on earth would I pay a subscription for what is essentially a database of National Park brochures. I can download these for free on the internet. | Because I had used the free version of the app to plan our park visits, it was easy to decide to pay for the lifetime membership.  The features I like most are the descriptions with photos and maps for hiking.  The app also allows you to easily keep track of parks you have visited - nice if all of the National Parks are on a bucket list.  Customer support is very responsive. | The app was a tremendous assistance while we toured Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.

Planning for a vacation? Gather any places to a trip, and organize them by category (Restaurants, Lodging, you name it). Add a venue to a day when it is time to make an itinerary! Invite friends and family to view or collaborate.

Add venues easily with place picker, a url (try a Yelp/Foursquare link!), or with share extension from other apps (Yelp/Foursquare app might have the best results).

View a trip by day activities, see all venues in consideration on the map, or in a list view with all categories of venues.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/2b/47/8d/2b478db2-6c46-7d25-6abb-13d66a017543/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-4-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN"",""ZH""]","16746496","15.0","2017-06-23T04:13:01Z","2023-12-12T00:27:22Z","We have been busy planning family trips with our toddler this year.

Get your crap together. It is really ticking me off that I am paying to have a crap app. | Since installing the newest update (#17) on my iPad I am unable to search for more than one location while in hybrid mode without completely closing the app and reopening it. If this problem persists I won't re-subscribe. The app in this new form is not worth paying a yearly fee for. | Really? Who’s gonna pay for an app rated under 4? | I paid for this, it should be grandfathered in. They shouldn’t charge subscription after I purchased the whole freaking app. And yes, I tried restoring but couldn’t. | Still can’t see state borders. | I needed to use this for a project but when I used it the place I needed was not updated! This would have caused a problem! PLEASE UPDATE THE MAP! In other words I would not really get it. Thank you for your time :).
P.S IT MAKES YOU PAY TI SEARCH F OR WHAT YOU WANT | Oh my gosh I could not believe Tandi came out the day I called. 

Tandi is awesome and has the knowledge to get problems taken care.

I also notice that in hybrid view they don't show up at all now.  Nice going with that feature; it looks exactly like the satellite view now.  It's also impossible to tell whether you're looking at the border of a country or a province, because the lines are all drawn the same way in hybrid mode.  Speaking of hybrid mode, why do I have to select it every single time I open the app?  It never remembers the mode.  Ever.  Finally, the same problem with the shrinking text exists in this latest version:  If you zoom in to better see road numbers, for example, the number shrinks down again so you're no farther ahead.  If the image gets bigger when you expand it, the text should get bigger when you expand it.  Otherwise the app should come with a magnifying glass.  Why the developers don't spend some time on usability issues like this I don't know, but these updates don't deserve all the self-congratulatory fanfare while these problems persist. | Deceptively “free”. You can’t search without purchase. This is part of the “full functionality” you have to pay for. | This is not what it’s cracked up to be at all | I made the mistake of downloading this when trying to find my Apple Maps. I clicked the option for 1 week free trail that turned into $4.99 a month after that. They immediately took $17.07 out of my account. I cancelled & informed them that this was an accidental purchase. 2 weeks later they took another $17.07 out of my account. When I went to my subscriptions to make sure to get it right this time, I see that I had the $4.99 subscription. WHY ARE YOU TAKING $17.07 out of my account for a service I accidentally purchased & NEVER once used?! 
Not to mention.. I never used it even once because trying to get directions to a place in Texas was impossible because it kept coming up with an address in AUSTRIA!! | Gets to where I want to and that counts! | This app tells us a lot about where we’re going and when you press the arrows it | This app is like the istreets for google street view but the problem for this one is that does good give you 4 layouts but you have to pay for directions but you can do different things with app so great for that but you have to pay to do directions like the other app so they have one better future and map app shows more than google maps so it is 3 stars average app | By thierno wow | Never thought I could love an App as much as I love this one !!’ Thank you   thank you so much creating this app!!! | Canʻt change the route I want to take by dragging direction line to another street.  Google maps is better because I can make could changes. | not working out for me, would like a refund so i can get a map app that works | Absolutely terrible!  Very glitchy. Couldn’t find an easy address. It’s an IPhone 11. Shouldn’t be happening. Tried to go to manage subscriptions... error finding link. I cancel my subscription!  Please note! | You have to pay to search things!?!? You have to pay for everything I wanted to search this app is horrible! | How to cancel I did not know they are charging if somebody know can tell me before they charged | On May 6, 2019 I paid 29.99 to help you poor souls out because Google was squeezing you. Where is it? I paid for it and I expect it! F*** Facebook! How do I get what I paid for?

I still can’t access this damned thing!! send my damned money back or start the damned service over giving me access! I’m not signing up for God damned Facebook to access  this crap app!!!!!

Dec 1, 2019

Still nothin from these As-holes or Apple. Paid for this 5/6/19. Has NEVER worked. Just asks to be paid for the service. | Doesn’t work too well on Apple Watch, I’ve tried to get to street view and maps but there’s no way it will open. Hopefully soon there will be a fix but for now it’s just gonna stay unfixed... | Scam seller who screwed those of us that paid up early when they were just starting - now we get f&$#%cked by being forced to pay TWICE then forever !! STAY AWAY FROM THIS CROOK!! | After I pay for this app, they ask my for monthly fee. and now not working, any more tell I pay again. Ill use google maps app for free and more options. | To use the search. Button you had to PAY and also to use the rest of the app just stupid | Dr. Patrick Adarsh Hart | Allows you to install the app and then offers no functionality at all until you pay for a subscription. | Not worth it. | At the time I downloaded this application, I paid for it.  One time payment.  Now I see that was a scam, if I am to continue using this app I will have to pay again and and again.  Crooked!! | This app blows; I deleted it ten minutes after paying for it. I want my money back!!!! | Because why we got to pay for the stuff | I got this game happy to see the world. Then I got hit with purchasing things... so I didn’t read them cuz... who got time for that? Then when I tried to do anything I needed to buy it... maybe you should actually take into consideration I’m broke. | Garbage app | as an armchair traveler I love this program. I use it to look at everything. It is super fast and super efficient ; now they have had to add a fee due to Google charging fees for their access but for me it's totally worth it. Google maps has certain limitations and this program lets me do Street view with a lot of functions that I can't do the other way. Some people on the Internet whine if they ever have to pay a subscription and I try to avoid them too but in this particular case it is worth every penny. This is probably my favorite app. Bob Cook | This is a great app Ben using it for years even before you had to pay for the full version   it’s worth every dollar | I like this software very much, especially street view. I also like the directions, route, and mileage feature. | For some reason it’s not allowing me to share my location thus making the app completely useless | A must download .😀 | This app does not function including the subscription management button to cancel it. | Not free | I saw this street view on someone’s phone long before I had a smartphone- and after catching up and coming into the 21st century with the iPhone, I was always disappointed I never had that view i remembered once seeing. I do all the contributor activities and have all the ‘google’ map apps and this app takes it to a  different level. Luckily, i happened to STUMBLE across it and as much ‘iPhone understanding’ as I THINK I have, I knew nothing about it! Please get a billboard, sky writers, or cigars made that alert others of this magnificent advancement! Thank you | We paid for the app; but now, it requires a subscription to use.

Um, no. | This was a great app UNTIL the update requires a subscription fee!!! WHY should we pay a fee when Google Maps provides the exact same map base for free? I will now delete this app from my iPhone and iPad and begin using Google maps for free. | As someone who grew up with AAA maps and Triptiks, I love looking at maps when I'm planning a trip.  Now I've graduated to maps on my iPad and this is my map of choice.  I hated having to pay for a subscription this year, but I didn't want to lose this easy-to-use app. | I see absolutely no reason to pay a subscription fee for something you can literally get for free. Just get the google maps app, it’s free and works just as well if not better than this app. | I used to love this app for routing road trips.

I’m doing Delivery with this app, but the price is too high couple days ago. I did it free trial with other app have a price of this and it’s working very well. I’m just waiting to finish my subscription and then move to another app.! | Great time saver for routes | Excellent notes and categorization features and route optimization is awesome | Overcharged me twice in two months I wrote, and nobody ever get back to me from support. So had to cancel it. | Used this a few times to drop off Christmas gifts to many different clients and it made my life so much easier. | I found the app helpful and time saving. | Easy to use, fast and efficient. It has many useful features. It’s a great app! | easy to use. very efficient | It sometimes have me bypass addresses but it still works ok | Love it it’s easy and great | For $20 a month I would expect this to work without any flaws. Put first route in and just loads does nothing. Not even worth a download | When making a lot of stops in an unfamiliar neighborhood this app saved me a ton of time!!! | It a great app for a self independent contractor. But it could used more features. | Really want to give this 5 stars s but really need to be able to avoid u turns. | I use this app to optimize my daily routes, and needless to say my efficiency has gone up significantly by using this app. Because I am not going from one side of town to the other IM able to knock on 15 to 20 more doors per day which directly correlates with more sales. 

This app does take a little bit to learn, but once you get the basics down, it is very easy to operate. I highly suggest any B2B sales person use this app. | Comes in handy for real time professionals | Nice tool. | Works like a charm | Stop asking for a review | Hard to navigate to next stop on app!!! | Great app | The Route optimization app is an essential addition to my daily routine. Not only does it efficiently plan out my trips, but its multi-stop feature is a lifesaver for my busy schedule. 👍

The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy to input destinations and receive real-time updates, transforming travel planning into a breeze. | I work as a nurse practitioner and use this app for more efficient schedule and seeing patients at home. It helps me to plan a better day for more effective mileage. I wish I had the ability to be able to slide changes of address priority. | I am very pleased!!! With going from home to home for work this saves me time and money!!! | It’s great | Just moved to a new state and started a driving job that involves pick ups and delivery’s. I would literally be lost without this app. | This app works great for delivering just packages on Sundays or whenever I have used a lot of apps, and this is the best by far!!!! | This thing wastes more gas than it’s worth. It has you driving around like a snake, u turn after u turn. HORRIBLE!!! | So far so good. I’m a side arm garbage truck driver and it leads me pretty well to the right side of the road stops since I can only do one side. It’s connects with google maps which still continues my route in no service areas. | Makes the seemingly impossible, doable! | Great | So, its quick app. i like its fluent. i see they added the search option. Thank You So much for that. This app really does help my day. i recommend to new Couriers. Any company i definitely would recommend you use it as company standard. The Devs they listen. Thank you guys again | Affordable, optimization works well | Great | Love that it takes less time and more efficient route | Great app | Works great | I used this app to find the most efficient route when posting flyers for outreach | I use this daily to set up my route for delivering office supplies. The only problem is that you can’t “insert” a stop to a route if you need to make changes. You only have the option to add a stop and re-optimize the entire route.

Also! Their customer support is responsive and knowledgeable. | Great app I wish it was a free version of this also | I’m a medical courier driver and this app save me time and money. Best route app for anyone working as a delivery driver going to multiple locations. | Hands down best app for delivery drivers with multiple stops | This app answers many of my present needs. I am a school administrator and I use this to route my home visits more efficiently. | Couldn’t be happier with this app, it has saved me so much time and stress! | Bush shdm had njxjxkcj. Sjjkdjd.  Skdkkdn | Nice | Please stop prompting me to leave a rating/review 5 times a day.  Really annoying | This is a pretty expensive app just to have route deletes randomly. Not impressed so far.

Does anyone know a good route app? This is my 5th app in 2 years. | I downloaded this because I was supposed to be able to scan all the addresses in instead of typing them all in one by one. And there’s no option for that. I do like that I can log a signature, photo, ect",4.46978,1522,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a3/d4/4d/a3d44d30-1059-0b0f-686c-c710960fe7ca/8595658f-7d16-4fcf-85ca-353998c35812_01.1__U2013_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/52/b2/43/52b243f9-a3ca-7347-3448-b86e151d7d88/5c5d9303-11ef-47e4-80b0-33237a3d05c8_02.2__U2013_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/fd/5c/e4/fd5ce4ae-756c-6f62-cc8f-af16e2a50046/c44b888f-8217-4473-8aea-c3972589b4ef_03.3__U2013_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/06/52/48/06524848-c5e7-79af-2628-c1d4f172189a/f9bf8280-8b29-40d0-bab3-188be15c863e_05.5__U2013_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a8/c0/3c/a8c03ce5-7d05-fbe2-7aac-545094bbda3e/9f5596ad-aa13-43f9-8085-d4a8b12e9e8f_06.6__U2013_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f2/26/21/f2262143-66dc-608f-02a0-84cd51063c1b/3158e6d4-b3aa-463c-8bbc-47d986dbe156_07.7__U2013_1.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/45/fb/a6/45fba621-3f6e-9125-31b0-a12bd5955fd5/07dc4910-40b4-4a75-bc03-4b35c7890882_iPhone_14_Pro_Max__U2013_53.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ad/cf/a2/adcfa2a8-93ce-fb9f-3c33-b56aabf13983/b96cfb02-ef37-446d-84fa-1d3069ac98ad_iPhone_14_Pro_Max__U2013_46.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ef/31/01/ef3101bf-4392-9f2f-0c7d-01989f1fc553/30560e58-a23a-4465-908b-8889be2d01c4_iPhone_14_Pro_Max__U2013_40.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/8a/bf/ae/8abfaea3-443c-c02a-9d70-0a36516994f1/7433a7b1-f9f9-4cb3-8dae-d2913e075311_iPhone_14_Pro_Max__U2013_23.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e4/69/8b/e4698b54-2998-8103-03bf-0fc74c74ee79/915089b8-b1aa-4f04-a4e8-55d835e0f9da_iPhone_14_Pro_Max__U2013_24.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b1/9f/dc/b19fdccb-4d63-1487-50c9-f516e4c4d758/ae6b8b20-d5aa-4c4d-b560-008da86aed79_iPhone_14_Pro_Max__U2013_25.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular""

This app makes booking a quality trip so much easier ♥️ | You make life so much easier to travel  grateful for this app | This app has opened me up to traveling to places I never thought of heading to before. | Las ofertas de viajes son fáciles de encontrar, es una app muy intuitiva 🩵 | Just downloaded it and it just shows a beach photo but doesn’t do anything else. | I used to love this app as well but not anymore they used to send me deal from New York City to Europe before they change I got a lot of deal send  by what’s app they stop doing that they came back sending deal by what’s app but is not from my departure city and all deal is not usa dollars. | Can we get one of the filters to be a home airport. Also can we get the filter to only allow so many miles from destination entered. | Ever since the last update I have been receiving two notifications for the same thing at the same time | Searching for flight NYC to DPS and cannot find anything close to the prices advertised.  Flights are $800+ not $585!  What gives? | App crashes when i try to scroll down to see other deals. I am on iOS 14. On IOS 13 it used to work fine.
I really like your app and check it out regularly for deals. Let me know when you fix the issue and i’ll update the review to 5 stars. | This site has many limitations and unless they have a deal that may or may not apply to one’s situation, the rest of the selected deal are not any better, if not much worse, than other sites with one exception, the site is not user friendly at all. | Not working | Redirects you to a safari etc page to book whichever flight. Might as well save ur memory space and just use the mobile site. | Best B place to find remarkable deals on travel | Nice and smooth | I have yet to experience a deal that benefits me in TravelPirates. I will keep looking for that vacation that wows me as a deal breaker. | The best for vacation to use | It would be great to have additional Sf/Oak departures! | Great App, great deals! Easy to use.. | Travel pirates used to give the cheaper flight by the green dots on the calendar. Now when you try to choose dates the green dots aren’t there and makes harder to find “cheap dates” to travel | Once you choose a destination you’d like to explore it is difficult to scroll. No matter where I put my finger it takes me to another page instead of scrolling. Quite irritating. | Amazing deals and so easy to use! Love it!!! | I love TravelPirates, this travel website have great sales to many places . I always helps me a lot when I’m planing vacations. | This application provides great information about traveling and great prices. | Only downside for me is there are hardly any deals out of Atlanta which is the busiest & largest airport, so I don’t really understand that. My niece was lucky enough to book a trip to Paris from Atlanta for dirt cheap.  Please find more deals from Atlanta | Been to Belgium, and Italy, and headed to Nee Zealand next month.  I’ve had the best experiences finding reasonably priced trips that fit my schedule! | While the app works well, once you click on the deal and attempt to scroll through the dates/locations and prices it becomes overly sensitive that it opens the browser link before you can begin scrolling. The moment I touch the screen to try and scroll after getting off safari from it being automatically opened to go back to TravelPirate, it thinks I select whatever date and opens the browser again. Highly annoying and upsetting. | Not user friendliness. 
Hard to navigate. 
Have yet to find useful. | I like the website and the concept of this app but some things are just not intuitive like why can’t I just create an alert with the given departure airport only. I just want to get all alerts if a deal is available from ATL. | They used to do it from other major cities like Miami and Fort Lauderdale etc. Hopefully that comes back. | This is used to be my favorite app but now any flight deals shown are from NY or LA, I scroll and scroll and scroll and don’t find any deals from any other major cities . Very disappointed. | No deals out of San Francisco area. | Please show deals from more cities than NY. You Never show deals flying out of Philadelphia. | I suggests tailoring deals to your user’s location otherwise this app only serves those who live in NY. 
I would give 5 stars if I could see the deals in my area. | You can’t leave the app to go check a note or a website because it makes you start over. Who are the developers? Who is in charge. Amateurs. | Great application with great offers! | My suggestion to improve this app is to make a tool where people can sort the deals from their departure city.
Many times when I will check the deals, the price is complete different from where I live.
I believe many people has the same issue.

Thank you, 

Michelle | This use to be one of my favorite apps where I could always plan a quick trip. However, lately they only show deals departing from NYC. Since I haven’t seen a change I’m deleting the app, no longer beneficial to me. | Haven’t used it yet but I hope these are the right prices | This used to be my favorite app for the last few years. I would find myself checking it several times a day, and I have scored some pretty great deals.
Unfortunately, few months ago they shifted their focus mainly on departures out of NYC. They also don’t seem to be bothered with people’s feedback asking them to go back to including other, major cities like they used to. 
Will be looking for a new app, unless they go back to the old structure in the immediate future. | Most deals are for New York or California. Doesn’t really help me find deals | This used to be the best app for finding travel deals, with flights originating from multiple major cities. Now it only shows deals from New York City.  So 5 stars if you fly out of NY, everyone else,  look for a better app. | It’s really the only way to see the world. Went on a once in a life time vacation to Mauritius, last spring using travel pirates.it was amazing, I’m currently using it now to book my next vacation!🤙🏽 | I've flown all around the world with travel pirates. I'm so grateful for this app and it's 100 percent legit. | Would probably be excellent app if it had flights flying out of all cities instead of just New York. | They falsely advertise prices and when you try to book it the prices are not what they are promoting the “error fare” is a lie they cancel your flight after you book it. Don’t waste your time on this app 👎 | I used to enjoy this app but at some point in the last 6 months or so it started to only show vacations and flights from New York. I understand that it would take a while to find deals from EVERY US city, but at least include Chicago and a west coast airport. | Great site but unless you live in New York it’s not useful.  Please expand offers to other cities like LA, Dallas,

On 3rd ID and it wouldn’t launch. Great idea-poor execution. Maybe someone else can do this better? | Very intuitive design, helpful in organizing travel with several people. This made the planning much easier. | Loving the app to plan a post Christmas trip to New Orleans.  Super easy to navigate and get input from two out of town college kids.  Even used the Portico article on NO to pick out a bike tour. | Absolutely love this app for travel planning! Not only is it great while I’m traveling, it makes it so easy to find recommendations from past trips for friends. Also love using it for exploring local spots, the maps make it so easy to navigate and add ideas. Love! | I love Portico’s service more than I could describe and the app syncing w my PC makes travel prep so amazing and fun. Probably my favorite app. Thanks! | Finally an itinerary management app that can be used while on the road! You can conveniently plan your next trip with this app. What is really unique about this app is that it shows you the distances between places when you plan your itinerary. Then you can move the elements around to see what’s the route for you, which saves you time and money. The UI is intuitive and aesthetically appealing too.

Portico not only helped coordinate travel planning (and made it fun!) but also was a day to day resource during vacation by having ideas, plans and reservations all in once place.

Things I want to plan and organize a trip were all thoughtfully built in to Portico, which was simple to use and included capabilities I haven’t seen with other planning tools. 

Thanks, Portico! Here’s to more vacations | I really love using this to keep track of where I’ve been and where I want to go. | Finally! I love having one place to save all my ideas and easily share my recs with friends. While I only schedule a few dinners and museums for trips, I especially love the cool maps for figuring out coffee shops in the morning or afternoon shopping while I’m traveling. | This app helps me organize all of my trip ideas. After the trip is over I can remind myself of my favorite restaurant or hotel and share with my friends when they want suggestions in the future. | Finally an app that we can create our own professional looking itinerary complete with addresses and a sneak peak photo. We love the ability to organize and share our trips with our friends. Dreaming and planning all wrapped up in a beautiful app! | I love traveling with my friends, and this is such a fun way to plan ahead... and look back on all the things we did... and share with others!

Try the Troupe® trip planning app, a free and collaborative travel planning app that helps groups vote and agree on the important stuff: like travel dates, destinations, hotels or rental houses, and activities all in one place.

Keep track of all your crucial details in one easy-to-use app and get going faster. Create polls, manage RSVPs, add notes, and share Vrbos or Airbnbs directly within Troupe®.

Whether it’s a milestone birthday, weekend escape, bachelor(ette) party, or family reunion, Troupe has you covered.


ALL YOUR TRIP DETAILS IN ONE EASY-TO-USE APP

Create one centralized tripsite for your getaway, where you and your friends can share everything from flight details to travel dates, hotel options to restaurant recommendations, all from the comfort of one simple app. Easily keep track of everything in one place, so you don’t have to jump from iMessage to Gmail, Facebook to Whatsapp just to know what’s going on. Manage trip RSVPs, set up polls, add suggestions, and vote as a group to build consensus and get going on your next group trip faster.


DITCH BORING LINKS FOR PICTURES THAT INSPIRE

Add links for destinations or hotels and watch as images magically appear to get your group excited for what’s to come. Have a photo in mind you know your friends won’t be able to resist? Change things up by uploading an image of your own or grabbing a beautiful snapshot from our friends at Unsplash to add a dash of color. It’s a surefire way to get travelers excited about what's to come and help your Troupe get going faster.


NOT SURE WHERE TO START? POLL YOUR FRIENDS

Create a poll to gather feedback on what fellow travelers want to do on your trip. Build custom questions and answers that help you narrow in on key details like budget or hotel options, what kinds of activities people want to book, and which flights look best to the group. You can even add links to polls to help your friends make decisions and get going faster


INVITE YOUR FRIENDS AND KEEP THEM UPDATED ON YOUR TRIP’S PROGRESS

Wrangling a large group? Keep track of who’s coming, who’s not, and who’s still a “maybe,” with our simple invite management system. Troupe notifies you and your planning group every time a new traveler joins and updates everyone when suggestions are made, voting has begun, or feedback is needed to keep the momentum going. Inviting friends via group message, SMS, or email makes it easy to add new travelers as your group trip evolves and grows.


BROWSE AND BOOK VACATION RENTALS IN APP

Through our booking and rental partner, Vrbo, travelers can browse, suggest, and vote on short-term rental homes (as well as hotels) without ever having to leave Troupe. Once your planning group votes on where they want to stay, simply book the property and get going. Can’t find a Vrbo you like? Travelers can also add links to hotels, Airbnbs, or any website on the internet, allowing you to compare all your options in one easy-to-find place.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/75/b3/8d/75b38d29-c3da-f4d0-b78f-f77f9e5bdbdc/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Lifestyle""]","[""6003"",""6012""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","10523648","12.4","2022-05-09T07:00:00Z","2023-04-04T15:19:54Z","Improve push notification experience","1.1.0",0,"USD",true,1610022192,"Troupe, Inc.","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/troupe-inc/id1610022192?uo=4","https://www.troupe.com",4,"Not sure where my previous review went but this app is broken. So…..I logged out of my Troupe account to show a family member how to create their own account to use the app. When I tried logging back in using Facebook, it says Facebook isn’t an option on the app. Then when I tried logging in using the same email as my Facebook email, it says I need to log in using Facebook since that was the original way I logged in ☠️

I’ve sent emails and DM the Instagram and tried the chat support but no answer so far. Super inconvenient since I’ve already had half my group signed on and connected to vote/etc. | This application is a web wrapper. There are far too many clicks to get things done. Please consider adding a feature where friends can mark that they are attending an activity instead of just voting. I think this focuses a lot of voting/planning rather than an itinerary for a finalized plan. | I’m sure sure to explain this but this app feels like a website app. It doesn’t seem like a real app and I would not trust it. It just doesn’t seem legit. Not recommended. | Planning a group trip with a few friends that all live on opposite sides of the country. This has made it so easy to share ideas, vote on options, and keep people in the loop. So well designed and intuitive! | Nice solid and well-organized app with some good features, though there are some limitations. Really need to be able to add photos and URL’s to polls, broadcasts and notes; need to be able to ask multiple questions in a poll; need a section for itinerary and important info and details to be posted; and ideally would become a communication tool for those on the trip with a chat feature for the group. These features would make it much more useful not only in planning but also for everyone leading up to and during the trip. Edit: Didn’t notice the WYSIWYG editor for Notes before, that will help with a couple of my points in the absence of a more purposeful feature. | A one stop shop to plan group travel.

Huge disappointment. Use Google Earth for free. | Not happy. Please refund me immediately. I can no longer let my kids explore without pervert ads showing. | Beautiful! | Update made it not work why would I even consider paying for the new additional features when the book no longer opens. Fix it and I might consider paying for the new stuff. | I bought this FULL APP long ago but now it doesn't open and U want me to pay you!!????

I can't restore purchases??!! | The places were really pretty but you can literally do more with Google Earth. | I’ve accidentally hit the annual payment button  few minutes ago. Please cancle my purchase. T-T | I paid for this app then they decided to remove most of the content and ask for more money to get the gold packet. There used to be multiple shots for all cities now we only get one. How is this even allowed. | I’m very angry that this app I’d paid $10 for later decided to add in-app ads on every page for a subscription upsell.   I used to be able to let my young child use and explore this app, but now every page has multiple risks of them clicking on a monthly billing charge.   In a cash grab after-the-fact, the publisher has made this app suddenly useless to me.  I’d genuinely like my money back. | As soon as you open the app it tells you you have 3 days to try and then you will be billed $59.99 a year. That price is absurd, couldn’t delete this app quick enough. | It can be a good idea but it  one of the problems I faced using my iPhone x was that it's not full screen and optimized, it should be  updated. | Awesome,I love this app! I highly recommend this app...😉👍✈️✈️✈️ | Each category had wonderful panoramas and you will never get tired of looking at them! The first month I had it, my sister kept asking to look at it in the car. I totally recommend it! | very beautiful photos please put new photos of nature and relax music 🎵 in future updates, thanks 🙏 | I like this app's layout.  It makes it more interesting than if the app was just a collection of scrollable pictures (epic pictures). 

With that said, it'd be nice if you could do more interactive things with the pictures themselves (maybe show on a map the location of these places compared to your location, population and other demographic information, some random and interesting facts about each place).  

It's definitely a great app though and worth every penny (very affordable by the way). | Best app ever | Genius in every sense of the word | This app is amazing the pictures are very life like, it allows you to see other parts of the world right from your phone. | Although these are indeed high quality Panoramic views they are obviously centered on a specific point which may not be the point that reflects the best position to highlight a specific place. There are limited places of interest shown and I feel it was $2.99 wasted, for better descriptive views I can obtain elsewhere. | Worth the money I spent....though a little dizzy... | If you enjoy travel to exotic places, scenic mountain vistas, and beautiful waterways, this is the App for you. No need to pack, just open your iPad to enjoy beautiful high resolution photography complete with full descriptions of each location! | So very well made and simply amazing! More places, please! | Worth every digital penny. I hope you will enjoy this app as much as I do. The only thing I would request is virtual reality headset compatibility so you can view the motion effect differently. Tribute to the designers of this app. | This app is amazing!! The content is rich and high quality! The one major disappointment is that there doesn't seem to be a VR or Google Cardboard mode. | Add 🇵🇷🇵🇷 | It's great, I no longer need to travel | This app is nothing less than breathtaking. The stunning panoramic photography immerses you in the scenery. I felt like I was actually there. You won't regret it! | Very fun explorer app. My kids love it. | I am 21 and I don't get to travel as often as I want to but for 2.99 I can at least put my mind there especially with the 360 view. Love this app can't go a day without it!!! | This app has encouraged both of my homeschooled kids to research different countries and cultures.  My oldest is determined to visit India one day thanks to the image of the Taj Mahal. | Awesome app and great idea! Keep up the great work and keep the panoramas coming. | Absolutely gorgeous app well worth the price. I look forward to future updates with more items added. | Educational and fun to use 🤓 | I love this application. Virtual 360 degree views of spectacular places. Eye candy for the mind. Looking forward to future updates with new sights to see. | This is so detailed and well worth every cent. Amazing to cure boredom or just relax! | This app is soooo worth the money!! The panoramas are STUNNING!! Since I don't travel anywhere ""exciting,"" this app lets me experience those ""exciting"" places. The only thing I would love to see in the next update/s is a search engine which allows you to look up the place you want to see!! Other then that, this app is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see the world!! | Absolute the best app I seen in a long time,I really enjoy watching the different city and I hope y'all do one in New Orleans. | Such a cool app. Really cool to see all the different places around the world. Worth the price and more people should buy it!!! | High quality app experience with clever design and wonderful panoramic imagery. | Seriously amazing app. I get lost in it. | AirPano is unlike any other app I have found.  The 360 degree photos are stunningly clear.  I am looking forward to more video additions to the app.  I also have the Airpano video app of the Russian geysers.  Very nice.  Need some videos of the beautiful cities and other locations. | Love it!!! | I had this app for a few weeks and they never uploaded anything new. You can see all the content in a day or two and then that's it. Better off just browsing google images. | The description makes it sound fantastic, it's a stationary pic, Google earth trumps this by far. Zoom in? Barely. Pretty disappointing, got it for the kids and they were done in a minute with it, the whole app is fully explored within 10 minutes. Even some locations were quite anticlimactic and very random. | This is a really beautiful app.  The photos are really beautiful.  I can hardly wait for other locations and cities to be added. | Visually stunning | Beautiful UI, useful information | A 360 degree view of many stunning destinations. Delightful presentation. | How often do you get beautiful pictures without strings, without payment, with an excellent display.",3.87736,106,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/38/a7/24/38a72430-831b-b493-09eb-f9c7fe56bb3b/mzl.yheobxmv.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/27/6b/b4/276bb4c3-8512-b976-1571-4d69c4ae1460/mzl.xrggrdbm.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/25/5a/f2/255af2f9-7db5-2dbb-da86-98fd9edf796a/mzl.nrohjxbr.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/54/de/23/54de2374-df20-8d9a-0cf9-b6d26fb3e615/mzl.lbpxvcxa.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/61/71/f1/6171f1a5-fd7b-b969-828c-d0ef1388f5eb/mzl.pyuxprcp.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/9f/9b/66/9f9b6606-84d9-1677-ab51-47cdc49674c8/mzl.vgpqyvqe.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/21/69/80/21698063-9f47-8167-ad4e-0e9dedd33be7/mzl.vnlrvbeb.jpg/406x228bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/b1/61/23/b1612327-f102-aedb-5941-88d6f2001765/mzl.hiuxfbjn.jpg/406x228bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/2e/54/c1/2e54c12d-121a-84fe-f336-034b880e03a7/mzl.oyqqrzwe.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/4a/3f/26/4a3f26a7-636c-ffae-4955-fa65597a2ffa/mzl.hmnywutr.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/61/93/06/6193069c-b815-8dff-d6dd-764e03fce75b/mzl.uozariwk.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/f7/be/9f/f7be9f9f-3c90-4a42-6eb8-4b2a3c5fe7d3/mzl.vrfapojs.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/28/d9/30/28d930a3-1eb7-7dd1-4c26-41903059351b/mzl.wcwtigte.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/54/96/5c/54965cf5-4b01-4dc0-cfd2-f6b1937ba2de/mzl.urlxezjk.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/ff/30/5b/ff305b45-e868-f096-0a9e-345800c646b1/mzl.zdsfmgtp.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5-iPhone5"",""iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen"",""iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G"",""iPhone5c-iPhone5c"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iP

Clear turn by turn voice prompts and great route planning options. Highly recommend! | Perfect for motorcycle riding. App is easy to use and very intuitive. Gives you the choice of extra twisty roads or less twisty. Keep up the great work!! | I am using this app for many years. Forget Garmin.
It is easy to use, share and create beatiful rides in a matter of few minutes. While I am enjoying my travels with help of Scenic, my club memebers attending Garmin seminar.  There is no need for seminar if you are using Scenic. Simple, user friendly. Learning curve is very short. Thank you Guido for creating this functional tool for adventure riders. I am using old Iphone-8 with no service just for navigation. And my main phone is in my jacket pocket
No need to spend $600 for nav. unit.
I am happy with this app | I really enjoy this App and how easy it is to use and plan rides | Nice customizable app. I use it for long trips. Easy to use. Works great on both Car Play and on IPhone handlebar mount. | I used to be a fan of scenic, especially it's one time payment options. Ive been using it for years , but after the recent big update, its been very unstable on ipad. It crashes over 50% of the time when I search for a location while in route planning / edit mode. That's just not acceptable. It wouldn't be as bad if there was an auto save option, but there isn't so I lose all my work! I gave it two stars instead of one in memory of when I used to be able to edit routes on ipad. | I have used many different iPhone GPS travel planning apps and guidance apps. They all have some good points and some bad. But so far, scenic looks like it has both great planning capabilities and great for use while on the road as a GPS device. Strongly recommend free version is pretty limited, but I tried it for a few days to see if I liked it and it has all the basics covered but in order to really enjoy this app you’re probably going to have to pay the subscription. So far I think it’s totally worth it and reasonable. | It is a very difficult app to use and is not user friendly in my opinion | Can you move the current year’s folder of rides to the far left instead of having the oldest year to the far left? Thanks! | I was fortunate enough to run into this app a couple years ago when I helped do the commercial for its initial launching. I must say it’s a great motorcycle travel companion app. It’s also great in the car and it’s absolutely fantastic now that it works with CarPlay. | Well designed and easy to use in place of a more expensive dedicated GPS. Some flaws in curvy mode will require careful cleanup of the route planned before usage. Good value for the price. I have used it a lot with maps loaded on phone. | I love this app! I’ve had others in the past that didn’t have all the bugs worked out yet but Scenic is above and beyond better in my opinion. | Continual improvements, thanks! | This app is great and has tremendous upside potential. | Unlike some of the others you can put plenty of waypoints, allows you to take a more scenic route if you want and be able to save your routes and make public or private. Good job | I've tried pretty much all of the apps out there. 
This one isn't perfect but it's soo good. | I like all of the features for different types of routes.  I especially like the planner.  I would of given 5 stars but the app has a real stability problem and frequently shuts down when searching locations. | I used this app last summer, using the credits. I have a Vespa scooter and really enjoy running the not so common roads. So, of course my course selection was “extra curvy”. Each time I tried to use this option, I was always taken off course and a lot of times ended up being right back where I’d already been, in one big loop. I’d try and shut the app down and have it recalculate but it didn’t seem to help. What did work was the typical fast, or short options. I really wish that the curvy and extra curvy worked the entire way to my destinations because I love all of the features.  Using the credits and things not working ideal wasn’t too much of an issue but it’s not something I’d want to spend money on just yet. I will check in after the next update.  It’s so close! | No question—this is the best GPS app for motorbikes out there. I’ve been using it for years and it’s never failed me. 

The user interface is the most intuitive I’ve seen in any motorbike GPS app and the route sharing feature is extremely handy. | The clever target system for placing an exact location for the next stop on a route is outstanding … not being able to export a ‘ GPX ‘ file from my ‘ 2023 IPad Mini 6 ‘ is baffling … hope I can get some help.

PS .. My IPhone exports just fine allowing me to utilize my Garmin XT2 on my motorcycle. | Great app for if your going on twisty roads or if you found some along the way. It’ll show your whole route afterwards. | Excellent ride small portion on a road that is rather rough, but overall a beautiful ride | I was real hopeful that your app would show me scenic routes, curvy road routes this sort of thing, which all motorcyclist crave, but as I outlined my first trip-  it just shows freeway fastest route, which is disappointing. Please add a button for scenic route options, and no freeway option. | Great turn by turn instructions and capable of importing GPX files. I’m liking this new update. | After trying four other motorcycle Apps I decided on Scenic over a year ago.  A very easy App to plan rides and I highly recommend it. | It’s been frustrating at times and a little difficult to learn but it’s worth it. I ride mostly back country routes and secondary highways in Southern Oregon and it’s amazing how detailed and complete the map data is. At times it worked better than a friends Garmin Montana in directing us to our destination. | I’ve looked at a lot of different options for navigation while motorcycling, and while there are a number of apps / devices that do some things well, Scenic is the only one that puts a check in the box next to all of my must-haves: - has to have downloadable maps: Scenic gives you a set amount of credits for downloading maps of desired states, with the ability to purchase more. I live in New England, so I ride a lot of different states, but the allotted amount of credits has been enough to cover all the states I ride in (7 so far). There’s no pulling you in with 1 state and then dinging you for the rest. Also, when maps need updating, that doesn’t go against your credits. Scenic doesn’t have those hidden costs so prevalent today. - has to accept custom maps from other sites: I use Kurviger to really detail my maps, and I love the fact that I can import this directly and simply. Scenic supports a number of formats from a number of different providers. - has to have good, clean interface when riding. The interface is very simple and clean. It’s easy to glance down under way and not get distracted. All in all a lot of great features and good value for the money. The only alternative I can see is a $700 Zumo, which, while nice, is hard to justify when Scenic exists. | Excellent for creating and saving routes. Awesome job by developers. Also works with Apple car play | After having downloaded the state maps I need and getting an update of this I can highly recommend. The route planner has always been top notch but the improved voice prompts and the battery saver mode are really good improvements so that you don’t have to have your phone screen lit all the time. One improvement would be a Lock Screen widget with next turn info or if battery saver could dim the screen until tapped. I’ve tried several of the apps and they aren’t even close to as good as this thing. (Hey Rever I’m looking at you). Keep in mind that it will force you back to waypoints if you miss a turn. You need to “skip” (trash can) the missed waypoint to stop being looped back. It takes a little learning curve but wow it’s great once you get familiar with it! | Excellent ride long day but I will ride this ride again | Allows me to create a route and import or creates a route or records a wander for a route. | I really like the Roundtrip feature. This makes it so much more fun to go for a quick 45 min ride on curvy routes. I just started using Scenic, I’ll write more when I’ve used it more. So far, I like it. 1 month later: Still loving this app. I use it with every ride. What I love almost as much is the quick response from the developer when I have a question or suggestion. | I love the app | This application is slick and accurate, and is my go to application for planning road trips in my Corvette. Although it is featured as a motorcycle app, it’s As useful for planning, automobile trips, that feature scenery and spirited driving. | I keep trying new navigation apps and devices but each time I come back to Scenic it's better than before. The same is true for only a select few of the other navigation apps I use. | I have only used Scenic a few times, so far it’s great. I can see my rides in detail, with top speeds and total time with distance. | Our Porsche group uses Scenic for planning and driving complex mountain routes - and it works great. So easy to share routes. Top tip: use an iPad to plan routes. | Great Navigation App. Took me a few tries to get it the way I like it...different than other Nav Apps I've used. Try, read the help topics and you'll be pleased. | The best app for real riders | When clicking to search the keyboard does not come up.

Also didn't find the ""beautiful"" route accurate at all and very generic.

Clicking avoid highways lands the same results in Google maps | This is by far the best, easiest to use GPS route planning program on the market. If you're frustrated with Garmin BaseCamp and/or feel intimidated by your inability to use your GPS, give Scenic Motorcycle Navigation a try. I recently purchased a Garmin zumo XT2. It works seemlessly with Scenic Motorcycle Navigation. It's obvious that Garmin is moving away from BaseCamp, as a disclaimer now appears when attempting to use BaseCamp with the XT2, stating that the XT2 is no longer ""officially supported."" The future is wireless route/data file transfers. You no longer need to drag your laptop and cables along with you on a long trip. I'm not a BaseCamp hater, as many are. I used it for years. Having said that, BaseCamp and cables are yesterday's news. No steep learning curve with Scenic Motorcycle Navigation. The train has left the station. Jump on and start enjoying your GPS vs. hours of endless frustration. | Love the stats during a trip, maybe have more detailed stat sheet on saved trips? Will there ever be weather watch availability? Love the new look. | I’ve used numerous apps over the last 10 years and this gives me the most flexibility and functionality. The only thing I wish it had was integration with Butler maps like other alternatives, but it’s not a big enough necessity for me. 2024 Update. The latest version which is 3.5 is truly amazing. The developers have done announce Stan job, and my recommendation is not even higher. | Great app to use very user friendly even better after the update great job!!! | I never buy any kind of App, that is until I found Scenic. This app works so well. The fact that you can save rides to multiple bikes is great. The stats then can be pulled up for which ever bike you choose. Creating routes is so simple. I like that you can set up unlimited waypoints unlike a well known map app. There are so many other great reasons to use and purchase this App. | I have been using the Scenic app for nearly two years now. The most recent update took me some time to get used to the changes. What I really appreciate is the quality of the maps, which are far better than imaps or google maps. I find where google maps displays the road ends, scenic goes on further with more detail. Adventure riding has improved greatly. Incredible festures! | Using it for few years. Perfect replacement to Garmin gps. I am using it on my old iPhone 8 without cell service. Strictly for navigation. And my main iPhone is in my pocket. My club shares GPX files before the ride. I download file, adjust waypoints , choose to download route or track. Nice screen presentation. Easy to read while riding. Works great with my Sena. Nice job, Guido!!!!! | So bad and slow… I’m faster then on the map… | I have tried nearly every motorcycle routing app out there and Scenic is by far the best. The power planner alone is worth the money. If you have a specific route you want to take it will let you. So many apps try to get this right but they fall short. The maps are updated often and you can download them for areas with no data. The controls are easy to navigate while riding and it integrates into CarPlay for a seamless experience. This app keeps all of the promises the other apps claim to do. I’ve used it in the States and in Ireland. It worked perfectly. If you are a data geek this app will give you everything. Speed, altitude, distance, etc. I love it. | This is only the second app I have ever paid for to use. I usually stay with free version. I am very happy with my purchase! This is a great app, well worth the $25/yr. The app is the best gps I’ve used and I’ve used 5-6 different apps. Really has great features and the developer seems open to suggestions to make it better! Thanks!! 

The more I use the app, the more I love it!

I forgot to write this in my other review but I also think it would be cool if you could separately mark off the US States that you have been to and they could have different pages about them too. Anyways, just an idea!! Keep up the good work!!!!
From Brody | When I first made an account, it worked but when I exited put of the app, it signed me out. Then, when I tried to log in, it told me there was no account. I will never use this app again. I would rate it a 0 star if I could. | Really good to know where people want to go. By the way what is your favorite place to go. | This app shows ""Abkhazia"" and ""South Osetia"" as the independent countries, which is violating of right of sovereign republic of Georgia - these territories of Georgia are recognized only by occupier: Russian federation. | App freezes and won’t let me finish the wizard. It said user name already used but won’t let me edit it. Link in verification email yields error 503 and says email used not registered. What gives ? | This app works great and is visually stunning for tracking visited countries. I do wish they’d add an add-on for tracking visits to national parks to compliment the cities and regions feature. Adding World Heritage Sites would also be great. I’d love to do all my travel tracking right within Skratch! | Would be nice if I could export my map to print or share. | Saint Augustine, Fl is on the map but not selectable as a place. Seriously? The oldest city in the US is not in the list anywhere?

What’s worse. Suggest a city. Crashes the app. | Super Cool App | Doesnt work | the Caribbean is not geographically or culturally “Central America”. Please consider separating the two regions in a future update! | App freezes when trying to create a new account. Top right shows loading icon forever | I’m a huge traveler and have tried apps like Been and others but this one is my favorite. The regions & cities are broken down great to track your travels. Highly recommend | Amazing app! Nice to be able to color in and truly “map” my experience and travels. Very detailed and and if missing any cities, simply send an email and a prompt and polite reply from Skratch follows shortly with wanted cities being added. And to add, most of the apps features are free! But do pay for the great add-ons and support these great creators. | the best app to track visited countries and plan next trips! love it! | I have been using this app to motivate myself to branch out and see more cities etc when I have the chance. Being able to mark specific regions and cities is very useful, and when a city isn’t on the map the developers are quick to add it once it’s been requested. 

I have occasionally had an issue where the app will glitch and mark me as currently being in a country that I’m not in. Unsure if that’s an issue with the app or my phone’s GPS etc though. 

Also, there’s a bit of a visual issue on the “share” maps with places marked as disputed territories— they don’t show up and it makes it seem like you haven’t been there. It’s really noticeable when you’ve been to all the surrounding areas. I understand there might be some sensitive political issues, but perhaps a toggle for “show disputed territories” would be good? | The app is extremely slow and hung during setup. From that point on, the activation flow fails despite following the latest activation emails (link or code), it simply stuck in an endless loop and wouldn’t activate but kept sending me activation emails. Very frustrating experience. Bottom line, I loss all confidence of the app and its ability to handle my personal data. | I like the design.
Most cities big and small are there (but missing 25 of 400 I’ve visited).
Reached out two weeks ago to add a bunch of cities and no reply.
Where you at? | This app promotes Russian state propaganda about Russian occupied territories! It's not an accidental bug, I contacted them and they refuse to update maps to reflect international borders. Abkhazia and Samachablo is Georgia! | Quick response and helpful support! | It defaults it to cities when you have to pay for the cities… they also make it very difficult to have a smooth easy user flow. I’m not sure what they were thinking. I can tell the developers did a great job but the people running the app don’t know what they’re doing. | This app doesn’t work at all. Literally couldn’t get past verifying my email. | It’s okay and tracking where you’ve been. But 7 bucks to mark states is steep. Also, there are some inaccuracies on the map. Israel isn’t mapped correctly, and Palestine is marked as a country, which it’s not. | Would only down load memories if I took it with my new phone and would not let me up loud any other photos | In one of the newer updates they took away your ability to add videos and pictures for each region of the country you live in. All of the videos I had for each state just became for “the United States.” I prefer the former version so I can separate each state- America is a vast country! Other than that, a nice app for recording travels. | An app that asks you to give up your email to use the app, is a useless app. That’s my personal opinion, it’s an app to scratch off countries you visited. So why the email ? And why an email verification method? Just so i get my email rained with spam emails and marketing from other companies and the list goes on. That’s my review. | I’m obsessed with Skratch. I specifically downloaded it because not only you can mark the countries you’ve been to (which is typically what these apps do), but you can check states, regions, and cities! All the specifics you could imagine. And as a frequent traveler and lover, this is something one appreciates because having visited France (when you only went to Paris) is not the same thing, hahaha :) PLUS, I couldn’t find two cities that I’ve been on the map, I wrote an email, and they added them! I love when apps are in continuous improvement, and they show it! Best customer service ever :) plus, Ryan wrote a nice email notifying me that they added these cities for me!! | There are too many cities missing, yet those cities appear on the Map itself. I don’t understand why we can’t just select cities straight from the map anyway. Would be much faster than searching for them in many instances as well. | I love this!! Just a few edits: 
- would love to be able to track percentage of US states done. 
- would love to be able to track and mark national parks (as well as percentages)
- lots of cities missing, but just to name a few: Stowe, Vermont; Breckinridge, Colorado; Bayeux, France; many others. | Why no IPad version ?? Nearly everyone who has an IPad travels with it. You could make so much more use of the large screen .
Will it still come ???? | I just downloaded this app and think it looks amazing! I hope as the app continues to develop that more articles arise that allow you to learn not just about countries on the explore page but specific cities as well. It’s a tall order but as content continues to get added that allows you to explore more, it’s easier to justify the cost of the paid additions that allow you to mark regions and cities! Really enjoying this so far. Also I’d suggest that we still be able to hit the explore button for every country even if we didn’t mark it as want to visit. Great app! | it would be a great app if you didn’t have to pay to add regions and cities. i would rather have ads. | I have been thoroughly enjoying Skratch. I love the idea of being able to pin the cities and towns you’ve been to, and the app does all this (plus providing excellent information about countries as well as any travel restriction information) with only a few things that could be improved.

First, when you start to pin many cities on your map, then you zoom out to a full country views, the pins start to take over the whole map (even with them clustering together). For example, if you zoom out entirely on the United States, the clusters are larger than many US states (each cluster is about the size of Wyoming, if not bigger). Thus, if you have several clusters in different parts of the US, it can overwhelm the map pretty quickly. If there is an option to decrease the size of your pins/clusters so even if there are dozens on your map, it doesn’t overwhelm the background map itself, that would be great.

Second, Skratch provided over 18,000 cities and towns you can pin to your map. It seems like a lot; however, it doesn’t work well in certain places around the world. Cities only appear in the search results if they have a certain population, and if you are trying to pin towns you’ve visited in Alaska for instance, very few will appear. There was a popular website a year ago or so that went by the name “iafisher”, and on that site, any town would appear in the search, regardless of size. Even if the town had a population of 10 (like many small towns in Alaska - Diomede is one of many, for instance), if it was a proper census-designated place, it would show up in the search.

If these two features get tweaked, this app would easily be a 5-star app in my opinion. It has such a nice design, doesn’t feel “outdated”, and overall is an excellent travel companion. Keep it up, Skratch team! You have a great app on your hands! | If you can’t use the app without providing email or phone then all they want is your information. Immediate delete. | I just downloaded the app and paid for all access … honestly just a waste of money. They have VERY limited cities you can pin. You can see them on the map but if it’s not on the apps “list of cities” there is no way to pin. Shouldn’t there be a way to add a city ?? Or if it’s on the actual map… it should be available to pin. | Everything is great without any delay and very user-friendly. Best of all, Taiwan is recognized as its own. Valid. | A free app which doesn’t shove ads down your throat. At least not yet. | Me gusto lo fácil que está de usar y su formato!!
Solo faltaría que se pudieran incluir ciudades y regiones que visite!! | Had made my map and registered but when I go to come back and add more I hit log in and it never works. So basically it’s pointless | This is a MUST HAVE app if you’re a frequent traveler or digital nomad! You can easily see what countries are open for travel as well as track and view where you’ve been and lived.

Well done!! Highly recommend | Cost too much to get the features | Really makes you want to travel more. I wish they had kept the feature where you could mark which states you have lived in. | I have been wanting to create this app for a long time. Kinda sad it already exists now, but very happy to be able to use it. | Love the app but it would be so much better if I could friend people and look at their photos etc | This app is not only incredibly buggy, but also selling our personal data to 3rd party companies. Deleted the app immediately after detecting the data breach. | Update:

The developers responded, engaged in respectful and helpful dialogue, and we figured out the source of the miscommunication regarding the in-app purchase.  If you scroll to the bottom of the listing on the App Store, it does in fact state there are
In-app purchases. However, there isn’t a “flag” under the “Get” button that shows there are In-App Purchases as there are with many other apps. As I am based in the domestic US and not traveling internationally at this time, the free version isn’t as useful (country only).  Again - I misunderstood the app’s features and fee structure.  The developer was extremely responsive and even offered to send me a promo code to used the full features for free to ensure I could use the app and all its features and make up for the miscommunication .  I declined - the developers are running a business and deserve to be paid for their labor.  I just misunderstood the apps features and wasn’t aware there was a paid version when I downloaded it.  I will keep using the free version for now, dream about international travel using the countries, and when I can afford it I’ll be paying for the full features.  Can’t say enough about the incredible customer service and willingness of the developers to engage with app users.  Support them by purchasing the full version if you can afford it!  And if you can’t afford it at this time, use the free version app anyways and dream about international adventures and mark countries you’d like to visit someday.  

Just downloaded this app based on reviews online and in App Store.  Logged in and started trying to add places I’ve been and places I’d like to visit.  Imagine my surprise when I was prompted that if I wanted to select anything beyond the United States a a whole I would have to pay and was prompted with multiple tiers of payment options.  I thought perhaps I’d missed something and went back to the App Store.  Nope - nothing in the App Store about in app purchases.  I don’t appreciate misleading advertising.  While I might or might not have been willing to pay a small fee for full functionality, the fact that it appears to be intentionally hidden in an effort to get more people to download the app and then maybe they will pay anyway....nah I don’t respect that and don’t trust a company who operates with that nonsense. | I can’t even get into the app why why do I need a phone number or email! | Downloaded because others said it supported states. Apparently a new upgrade to the app makes it so you now have to pay for these. It’s not clear when you try to add them either it just keeps going back to another screen and ask you for power ups. | you have to pay if you go somewhere unless you check the app while you’re there. stupid. don’t download. | I’m from Georgia Tbilisi and your map is wrong. 20% of our country is occupied by Russia !!!

Buyer beware. | Used to be one of the best offline maps but unfortunately they stopped to make progress and updates when the ownership changed. Now it’s one of the worst offline maps. Really sad. | This map appears to be NOT fully offline.  If you open it immediately prior to venturing into no-cell-service area, it would work.  However if you open the app only once you are in an area without cell service, then (even with offline maps for given state downloaded) it won't show a map. | My downloaded maps would not work offline. So disappointed | Very hard to navigate site controls. | Having navigation that does not depend on internet connection can save your trip. I often use it to orient myself after emerging from a subway in a new city. Another plus is the easy process of placing waypoints on a map. We recently toured the salt mine near Krakow. Our bus stopped some distance from the entrance. Then the tour exited the mine a half mile away from where we entered. I had marked the bus location on Ulmon. This made it a simple matter to return to the bus. In fact, we were the first to make it back. | I enjoy using this app, despite my stumbling around a bit as I get familiar with it. | I use this map on all my travels.  Whenever I’m home, and hear or read about a place that sounds interesting, I mark it on the map. My only complaints are that there is no way to remove all of one type of icon, i.e. hotels. By the time I get somewhere, I generally already have a hotel. So all of those other icons just make the screen too busy.  Also, I would like to be able to select different icons for different things, preferably ones I could name myself. For instance, one for restaurants, one for sites, etc. | Used to be great. They just cash checks based on previous ratings. Maps don’t download. Saved locations are gone. Old info. | There is nothing intuitive about this app. I emailed, asking how to add friends.  No reaponse. Not worth it for free, so definitely don’t pay either. | Great app | not enogh functions. Search does't woek good | Not sure what happened to this app, I’ve had it a long time but haven’t opened it in years. I re-downloaded the offline map and when I turn airplane mode on it just shows my location dot. No roads, no nothing. Just my dot on a blank background. Also says this app hasn’t been updated by the developer in 2 years. Might as well remove it from the App Store. | I liked them on Facebook to get my one extra free map and it’s been stuck on 3% since about January 1929. Me thinks they are just trying to get you to pay for the service. While I got one free map download, I was offered another free download to like them on Facebook - which I did. Way I see it, T hat’s free advertising for them with a guaranteed extra map - so it says. When I can afford it, I will pay for the service. It seems pretty good. Offline maps are super handy when you find yourself in a Peruvian jungle with snakes that could climb the Empire State Building. Otherwise I’m sticking to my 3 star review. Thank you for reading.

PS - I would like to say that my map downloaded with ease after writing this review. I’ll take it up to 4 stars until I can test it in North Korea. Thank you. | I upgraded to pro before my honeymoon in Italy. It worked for one day without issues but then started “blanking” if I wasn’t on WiFi. I downloaded the city, province, and country maps before I went. It would only show me my location and my saved places, which was still helpful but not what I paid for. The map would only show once I got back into WiFi, and I couldn’t close the app in fear that it would go away again. After about 5 days, the maps wouldn’t even load when I had WiFi. I’m back in the states now with service and they still won’t load. It is a dead app to me now. I emailed customer service a month ago and they have not responded. I believe it is just a revenue stream for its parent company and they put absolutely no resources into it. | Download a map and mark the places you need, like the hotel, and use it. You can find where you are and direction your facing while away from Wi-Fi. Very nice. | Very usable but they dumped ALL my previously stored points. Super frustrating! | What happened and why? Suddenly it works?? Good job!! | App indicates email not verified, but email says it is.  Tried going to website id’ed under help, but get nothing but banner. | Did somebody/thing buy the original citymaps2go? All my stuff is gone. They want sign up not sign in and since it’s been awhile who knows. Last encounter was to purchase the PRO version and that was such a goat rope with little to no support I list interest about the same time my traveling stopped. About to start up again and it’s like I was never here. So much for tge integrity of the digital world | This used to be a great app, but it no longer works. Just shows an empty map. Restarting and reinstalling doesn’t help. If you rely on this app to find your way in a foreign place, you will get lost. | Easy to use with great detail. | This was my go to site for travel maps for several years, I bought the premium lifetime version of it and loved it. About 9 months ago the actual map disappeared to just a blank yellow screen with orange stars in the locations I had saved in each city. I tried to log out and then back in, and uninstall and reinstall the app along with several other  things. The app is now totally useless. I have tried several times to contact support to help me get the map restored with no response. Sadly, I now have to use another site for maps. 😟 | What can I say … CM2G always works … anywhere I’ve been. | My Pro App suddenly quit syncing among devices a few weeks ago. Despite attempts to get Support help. No answer nor help at all. There is no support | Just used the App in both Reykjavik, and Paris. Accurate, helpful, works without data connection costs etc. high marks! | so far pretty useless and hard to use newer app had it years ago and I was able to list the hotel I was at and sites and restaurants. can’t do so now | I use this app when traveling for the past 8 years and it’s become my go-to for marking my favorite spots. It’s also been a great reminder of places where my husband and I have travelled; allowing notes to help us remember prior experiences.

Definitely worth having whether your an experienced jet-setter or just needing help discovering a new city. 

Love this app and absolutely worth the investment! | Used for years but wouldn’t load saved places or even maps. Had to delete and reinstall and lost dozens of important saved locations | I use this every time I travel outside the US. The offline maps you can earn are incredible and you can mark where your favorite places are and never need to hold a paper map again. Incredibly useful! | There was a time when this app provided terrific offline mapping.  My last trip to Europe the maps would load sometimes, other times not at all.  It continually asked me to reregister. I paid the $14 for multiple map access but it was no help.  I think Maps.me will fill the market space for this application quickly.  Not sure if there has been an organization change but this product is no longer useful for me. | Being able to travel around a city with a reliable map allows for more relaxing travel with navigating foreign cities. Allows for you to just enjoy. | Great maps. Great  information.  I never travel without it. | Always asking for an upgrade subscription 
Difficult to navigate to locations and find pouts of interest to visit or see | VERY disappointed.  I can download a map, I think, but then can’t add places to it.  Why even have it up and looking “live” when it’s useless? | First of all, you can only download one app without ads or paying. Secondly, it doesn’t even work. I downloaded one map, and when I tried to use it without data, it didn’t work, which was really bad since I was relying on it to be my map when I had no data or paper map.

Total scam - do not use this app!!! | Ulmon was my favorite travel app, but when I upgraded my tablet and tried to re-download my account, I cannot due to a known issue with logging in via Facebook. It’s been months! I have submitted requests for support on an alternative way to access and have gotten NO response. It’s been weeks.
If you, like me, like to keep your travel ideas and favorite locations saved, don’t bother with this app. They will not give you any support. | I used Maps2Go on a recent cruise in Spain and Portugal. Even though I had downloaded the maps onto my phone before we left for the trip, the maps wouldn’t always display without connecting to internet access first. I never figured out if I was doing something wrong or there was a glitch with the app, but when the maps did display, all the places I had bookmarked were there and we got to where we wanted without buying local maps. | Long time user of this app. Traveled to many places and made use of the pinning feature. Upgraded my iPhone recently and tried to restore my past records and information to my new phone but the app won’t allow login using Facebook. I have only logged in unto this app using Facebook. Please restore feature allowing login with Facebook. | This used to be a good app, but they dump 8 years of pins acquired on many visits around the world. They will not respond to a help inquiry either. Take your business elsewhere. | Don’t get | This is a great app for mapping out wherever you want to go sightseeing in the world. Very good detail to each city. | This apo WAS great. Ulman sold it and it shows with lack of customer service. All of my maps are now blank screens. I emailed for help and checked the web site. No one bothers to answer. Save your money. | This is an amazing app that works offline if you download it prior to your trip. Sometimes it glitches and we can’t find the maps. | I've been using this app for 8+ years and I love this app. It's easy to search or add the places you want. I upgraded to the download map off line which is so worth it. It know your location so easy to find way. I also like that I can add notes so I add the guide book info. Then, I can just read the details from this app instead of carrying the guide book. My only critique is I wish I could make the stars different colors so I can have one color for must see/do, another color for 'if I have time', another color for restaurants and yet another for hotel. | This apps maps are pretty much like most others. Google or Apple Maps. It is downloadable. Searching is difficult as you must give it specific information like zip code and a close to accurate street name. This app will try to refer you to another app if you are interested in a hotel. That app wants any and all information that exists on your phone. Be very aware at what info this app will take. But still, the map is nice. But watch any linked apps or sites it wants to direct you to. Those apps and sites should ost these people to make the entire app totally free. They also do not answer any email that you may send them. That link within website is dead. | Been a long time user, and have had inconsistent results using this app in the last few years. Finally stopped working during a trip to Europe, connecting to Wi-Fi didn’t resolve the blank map issue.  Downloaded the Pro version of the app and all was good again. No data lost thanks to the cloud backup. | Just blank maps now 😢 | For an app that calls itself by this name the user really gets nothing for the download trouble. The app excels at being another TripAdvisor. Lots of things to discover in your specific trip, but maps are elusive. Users must pay for maps!!!!! Quite useless as a help for map downloads. I had this app years ago. It was better then, until it lost my private information to hackers. Resurrected now, it’s not as good, just information you can get elsewhere. | I’ve used this app over several years using the older versions and found it very useful for navigating while walking.  However this version was useless (I had to buy it again since my old version was out of date).  It wouldn’t connect to GPS satellites and the available maps have greatly decreased.  I downloaded the map for Morocco but it was useless.  Too bad as this used to be a great app.  To its credit the App Store refunded me the

More than once I'd be coming up to an intersection and realize that roads had just stopped paying attention to where I was.  So I'd go through the intersection, get pulled over, then the route on roads would show me some place that I was supposed to turn a while back, but doesn't give me the directions to get back to where the turn is... What is up with that?  Every other navigation app redirects you when you get off course... It's very frustrating. | I would like to continue using the app, as it did set up a decent route, but I wish it would allow deviations from the designed route. We were having a great drive, and found a fun looking road so decided to take a turn the app had not created. Once we deviated, the app wanted us to turn back and continue from the last point where we had deviated the app has created. That created a frustrating moment, and environment, so we ended up turning off the app. Earlier on that same drive, we stopped for gas, and exited the parking lot at a different exit that we entered, so the app would not continue with the route until we turned back and exited from the entrance we entered the gas station. Not a fun moment. I removed the app from my phone, as every time I considered using it, I realized I wanted to be able to stop to see the sights along the way, and the app would ultimately just be a distraction from the fun because of the issues. Sorry | Why can’t I record a course you used to be able to on an earlier version? it’s pretty useless if you can’t. | The current version (3.2.161) still has trouble rerouting if you miss part of a route or don’t pass through the start point. Another feature that would be great to have is an easy option to drive a route in reverse.

Edit: Rerouting is still broken in 3.2.244 and even worse now it it wants to route detours through parking lots and adjacent driveways. After trying to use it again I ended up needing to switch to a different nav app 1/4 of the way through a 300 mi drive so I’m deleting a star from my original review. | I finally found a free Saturday and called up the Roads app to find a fun drive up to Bear Mountain State Park. Waze called for a 55 min drive, so I was encouraged when Roads predicted a 90 min journey. Northern NJ has some amazing, spirited roads so I eagerly set out to follow the route. 

However, right away, I noticed odd guidance through 25 mph zones. The app directed me through a parking lot, then returned me to continue on my current road, so I ignored its detour through the lot and continued on, yet the app repeatedly urged me to turn around and go back through the lot. I stopped and restarted the route to get back on track, but again, all I saw was slow drives through light after light. 

After 90 minutes of barely exceeding 40 mph at the top speed, I frustratedly deleted the app and used Waze. 15 min later, I reached my destination and used Waze to return home on the Pallisades Pkwy, a terrific road with speed and scenery that I sought from the beginning. Porsche has a LOT of work to do to get me to try this again. | This app is very confusing much like most tech from PCA…not user-friendly whatsoever and not intuitive | Devs listen up, I have some real feedback for you. I like the premise, I like the UI, and I like how it allows you to cultivate a route around specific points. The 3D route preview is awesome.

The auto route generator is a nice feature, but it struggles to keep people away from roads with lots of traffic lights. I live right on the front range in Colorado, and half of my route is always thru some metro area with lots of lights, while the other half is perfect mountain roads. I could solve this with a route involving custom points, but it’d be nice for more personalization with the auto route generator directly, like an option to avoid traffic lights.

My biggest pet peeve, though, is not being able to do a route in reverse. Or if that feature is possible, it seems hidden. I need to warm my car’s engine oil up by driving more slowly, which takes some time, and I don’t want to spend this time driving the exciting straight part of a route just because that was generated at the route’s beginning. Some routes are better driven in the reverse order from how they’re generated. A simple toggle to reverse the route direction would fix this problem immediately.

Also, this only happened once, so I don’t know if this is 100% accurate, but my phone lost cell service and it seemingly caused the app to stop updating my location. If true, that’s a major issue. “No cell service” does not mean “No GPS signal”, and the app should attempt to dead reckon my location using GPS if my cell signal is lost. In my experience, the app just freezes and stops moving your little marker along the route, which is pointless for any route where there’s a cell dead zone. This could have just been the app freezing for some other reason, but for me, it happened at the exact moment my cell service went out. I had to switch to Apple Maps just to get home, since I was driving and I couldn’t safely mess with ROADS. Also, I was frustrated and didn’t want to.

One last nitpick I have is that the app color scheme follows your iPhone’s color scheme, with no option to just select dark or light. I want the ROADS app to be dark all the time, but I don’t want the same for my iPhone. It’s annoying that these are tied together, this always annoys me when apps force this. I don’t like the way the CarPlay app looks in white when it’s on a massive screen surrounded by a black car interior, as it’s way too much contrast and it just makes everything look bad. I shouldn’t have to change my phone’s overall color theme to dark just to make ROADS follow the dark theme — This should just be an option in the app.

Fix these very simple issues and I will update my review to reflect five stars. As of right now, the app is just decent. | Uses your location to give you rides near your area.  It has a cool preplay function where you can actually see the route traced out on a map from a semi satellite style view before you take it, very cool. 

Trying to find a route now to take, will report back after I’ve given it its trial run. | I love the idea. A little buggy. How is there still not an Android app? | App asks me to review new legal terms and conditions but gets stuck there. I can’t use the app anymore. | It’s not particularly intuitive. It would be good if you could see the steps of the route early in the process so you could better decide if you wanted to save it. | Awful!! | Helped me find backroads in my small town | I’ve been looking for something like for ever | Good idea, but then I realized I can’t be connected to apple car play, listening my music. That’s crazy and a huge negative of the app. | This app is very well made and easy to use. The routes are great and the customizability is a huge plus. | Very difficult for me to use. I need a tutorial | The app provides some much needed content. Most issues I found while using the app relate to the user experience. I spent a lot of time liking routes near me I’d like to drive only to realize later that there was no way to see the routes I liked. I can circumvent this by bookmarking the route but there’s no direct bookmark button like there is for liking. There is an extra step of going into the menu to bookmark a route so maybe make this it’s own button in the future or make liked routes accessible? I can’t be the only person to complain about this | Takes a while to figure this app out, it’s not that easy,there’s things that I want to do that it won’t let me.like check out route directions while in guidance mode. I guess there must be another way to do that. Eventually I’m sure I’ll figure it out. | This app has potential for sure, but it’s missing a critical feature. As expected, the app sometimes routes you down some crazy roads and when you get there, you want to avoid them. Case and point, it somehow wanted to route me through a school parking lot with massive speed bumps. No problem, you just turn on another road and go on, but this is where the app misses the critical feature of simply rerouting you and going in. If you miss a turn or choose to not turn somewhere, the app does not reroute and insists you go back to where it wanted you to turn originally, even if by now you may be back in the route that was planned. Would love to see that included in the future to give more flexibility if missing a turn or choosing to not use a specified section of road. | Very good | ai routes are completely broken - if i follow any route for 5 minutes it randomly makes me uturn and thinks that we’re at the end of the route already. carplay is also extremely buggy. there should be a way to transfer the route to a different navigation app like google maps. any way to fix this navigation issue? | Most of the routes are ridiculously far, but whenever I decide to travel, this will come in useful. Perhaps not a daily drive app if you commute, but definitely an app to have just in case.

Edit: Tried the route generator following Drive -> Create Route -> and setting desired distance. This solved my proximity issue! Great app, definitely worth downloading! | Everything is fine now | Driving!! This app puts emphasis on the driving and not the in app features and only focuses on what matters. | nothing more to say as real as i can get. does everything i want it to and has a great intuitive feel to the app. | When it works, the app is great for finding new routes to drive and ride. However, it has its bugs like sometimes not letting you log in, or right now, it says it needs an update even though there isn’t one available on the App Store. | Great concept but about half the suggested results have some odd routings through residential neighborhoods and boring connections between fun bits, completely ignoring backroads connectors. | Been waiting for something like this | This is the app I didn’t know I needed. I had been scrounging FB groups for routes in my area and saving them in Google Maps. That wasn’t really working well. This app starts with the assumption that I want a scenic route, and am willing to spend more time for the sheer joy of the road. I am just getting started on the app, but am loving it so far! | I submitted a route under the username -Bruce when Roads first came out, I see that now with the latest revision of Roads, the original route is gone and replaced with an alternate route. It appears that this change is because MapBox is missing the road that my route was on:
Wabasha County 11 (MN).
 I added a note to the route to explain that this route was on County 11 but I am guessing I am not the only driver whose cherished route was obliterated. 
Please fix this, Mapbox needs include all paved public roads in order to achieve its intended use. | driving down a straight road it repeats to stay/proceed on the road as if i’m not actually on the road | The app needs work. It feels more like an early beta release at best. Frustrating as can be to adjust volume. Constant reminders of alternate routes is confusing. No way to remove checkpoint on user created routes. Won’t let you bypass any checkpoints (even when the route has checkpoints on private property) so it just creates constant loops to get you to a place you shouldn’t go. | cool idea, needs more revisions | Pretty great for planning routes pretty awful for staying on them | when i heard about this app i was so exited!
until i used it for a day, the navigation system is horrible, and the routes are okay i guess, but i was looking forward to this and honestly i was kinda disappointed. | Fairly nice routes, navigation is good but looks a tad older than wayze. Good navigation for long drives though! | Love it | Great App with a great concept, but could use some improvements. | Overall the app is amazing and it made my morning commute significantly more fun lol | Found some great roads in the towns around me super sick app | Even though Porsche makes great cars, this app is so confusing and wonky that it's ultimately unusable. Trying to create custom routes is impossible and all the auto-generated routes in my area are basically a 30 minute commute through every straight and busy road there is. Great concept but needs major work. | 911 owner and software engineer here. On a rare day off I used this to try a local route. The app is utterly incapable of detecting the start of the route and just wants me to u-turn back to it, rather than seeing that I’m near it and beginning the route. And on that note, forget about picking up a route partway into it, that doesn’t work either. Great idea, poor execution. | I feel like it couldve taken me on a better route, even if its shorter, i went on a 30 minute drive and it took me around the same loop 5-6 times | Loving it so far! One feature I would add is the ability to search areas for routes. I’m planning a road trip and would like to see what’s around to plan some fun driving ahead of time. | This app is so much fun thank you to the amazing designers and developers at Porsche for making this concept come to life this app just took me on a hour road trip that I have never been on before by my house and I thought that was impossible because I have lived here awhile and driven what I thought to be every road in my area but Porsche created a route that include parts where I could get some speed parts where there where elevation changes and parts that involved turns this was my first time using the app and can confidently say it will not be my last I want to see what this app has to offer | It took us in circles through all residential neighborhoods full of stop signs, speed limit never went over 25 mph. Cannot use apple car play, how dangerous to have to use your phone while driving. | I like it.

By far the best app to plan routes. Just choose a direction, the approximate distance you want to travel, and to find the twistiest roads and your off! App is also great at tracking non planned routes. | Used it to ride from Ohio to Florida, roads thru Kentucky were fantastic, it’s just kinda expensive if you don’t ride much | Loved it but to pay 80!! is too much now it’s deleted from the phone | I used this app back in 2022 you could gps and track rides for free, now you cannot even use gps at all without buying a year of premium. Worthless app without gps or any of the features that are locked behind a paywall | This app was great when it was free. I could count on Calimeter scores for twistiness in the 20s for every planned ride, sometimes in the 30s and this was just using the free winding option. Now I paid for it and can’t get any scores above 12? All my routes are simple direct routes. It won’t give me anything fun even on twisty. I wish I hadn’t paid. Completely disappointed that it can’t deliver what it says it can. | This is a Great app but unfortunately they changed some stuff and now they charge you for things that use to be Free. | A navigation app that you have to pay to use navigation even without the extra features now…
Used it sporadically for a couple of years given the many flaws (weird UX, can’t search for a business name, doesn't update road changes/closures, etc), but as a free app it was OK. 
Cancelling my account and deleting it, as there other similar free options nowadays (even Google maps using the “no main roads” feature gives you a similar result with all the ease and functionality lacking in Calimoto). | Used to be good. Now basic features are locked behind a paywall. Not a usable app anymore. | App works great, easy to plan rides | At 60 bucks per year, this app is too expensive and doesn’t offer a lot more than other similar apps that cost a lot less, have a one time fee, or are free. Not worth the money. May be that is why in my area there is not much rides. And I live in what could be the capital of motorcycling in the country. | Very cool app makes riding way more interesting. | Downloaded the app won’t let me get past my biker nickname. Keeps saying I have spaces. Tried many times gave up on it. I will go another route but thank you | At first when I started to use Calimoto back in 2018 I wasn’t a huge fan. The idea was brilliant but the app was clunky and if you missed a turn the app would freak out and not reroute. I’ve kept tabs on it after the updates and over the past few months it’s blown me away. Reroutes are no longer an issue and it finds a the twisty roads like a king. I just came back from a 2 hour drive that a calimoto driver recommended and it was one of the best drives of my life. Highly recommend this and can’t wait for CarPlay. | Why no waterfall search? | I paid for a 1 year subscription to use this app on my old iPhone 6 since mounting a new iPhone to a motorbike destroys the camera. 

The app won’t give me access to the premium features even though I have 10 months of subscription available. 

I’ve contacted their support but they can’t help and keep asking me to do the same thing which doesn’t work. 

Now I have to use the free version and I can’t get my money back. | I tried a few different apps and always come back to this one. Love the way it works. One thing I would like to see is Apple Watch support showing GPS turn based arrows on the watch display. This would put it over the top!  Another would be to show the upcoming street name on the phone at least when approaching a turn. | First off the it doesn’t cost 59.99 like advertised. They charge 75. No response to emails or questions. The super twisty option creates no difference over the curve option. so unless you are riding out of your state or over the 65 max miles don’t upgrade. attempting to put in destination is clunky and confusing at times at best. you get used to it but you definitely have to use a combination of Google Maps to get the actual street address for GPS coordinates to punch in your destination. you cannot use for example a business name or a state park name. Only negatives I’ve found so far but only time I will be renewing is when I take my bike out of state again. | This app is very good and better for my purposes than it’s competitors. I primarily just upload existing GPX routes. The app does not have the functionality to reverse a route however. I really hope they add it in the future but until they do 4/5 stars. I’ll happily update once they do. | Will give 5 stars when we can use on our bike informant screen .. hope this comes quick | My first trip planning after I paid $60 subscription and already I see a MAJOR flaw in the algorithms. I live in south Florida and wanted to go up the famous A1A beach/coast route. I wanted curvy route and the app took me through US1 instead of the route I want. So I tried the non curved and got I95, a major interstate. Then I tried google map and google gave me EXACTLY the route I needed. And didn’t need to pay $60. | The app takes me to areas that don’t have cell service and it’s not able to complete the ride. Inevitably, it says “rerouting” then repeats “no internet” forever. 

Routing needs to be done on my phone using downloaded maps. | Have to pay premium $$ for anything out of my state. | Not easy to use. Can’t plan trip with exact addresses. | It’s an app with a great premise. You put in a destination and they will show you the twistiest path there. It doesn’t do it that well in my opinion and what’s worse is that they have now locked down all features to subscription only access. 

I get it, you need a have revenue to make a product work. But without subscribing to their plan they have crippled the functionality to such a degree that that app is basically unusable. Locked down to one state, no round trip access, enter a destination and it won’t give you the “twisty” route. 

They have some weird roads marked as twisty, like a highway on-ramp. Then, there are plenty of great roads near me that don’t even blip on their twisty map. 

Honestly you are better with Google Maps and checking “avoid tolls” and “avoid highways” if you are planning a trip. Or better yet, just go ride without the phone and get lost, find some new roads! | New layout is horrid. New users will likely be confused and not be able to locate/discover great things with the app. Maybe it’s horrible modern day interface design based on theory instead of what normal people want. The old layout was superior and more user friendly . | I absolutely hate the new update. It’s too chunky. When wanting to move via points around instead of seeing 5 at a time now you can only see 2. | This app is absolute garbage. It is slow to find directions. It often tells me the wrong turn and makes me do u-turns. There are no street names, no lights or stop signs. I tried a tour someone else had done and it was the same. Going to try for a refund. Buyer beware | You guys killed this app!  I don’t own a bike yet (hopefully soon) but use it for driving in my car.  Works amazing, i’ve tried a couple other apps to generate routes.  This app is packed with so so many useful features, i’m still finding out awesome things you can do with it.  The round trip planner is my favorite part, especially because you can set the compass direction (for me always west towards mountains).  Keep up the great work, premium is absolutely worth it but a monthly option would be good to have for me, I don’t use it in the winter so paying for the whole year is annoying. | Just finished first ride using this app! Love the features so far | I tried searching for “black canyon road”, of which there are multiple locations. There were NO search results. How is this any better than Apple Maps, which, too, is useless. | Horrible search results. Does not find “places” nearly as well as other maps. | Have discovered more new roads with this app than the previous ones combined.  I also think the premium membership is reasonably priced and totally worth it for Super Twisty mode alone. | I tried everything to get turn by turn navigation to work over Bluetooth but nothing worked. Pretty disappointing on what could have been a cool app. | Route creation is complicated by not being able not use the map to add points. A route going north on I-5 and it jumps on/off just to get a bit of off highway riding. | App is great for finding routes and tracking your ride, however,If you are trying to find a business to be routed to, it can’t find them. Other than finding addresses, the search function is pretty weak. | Just wish I could pay for premium features ala carte. Just want to buy states and try extra twisty. Don’t need the every state. And 65 a year is too much for me to buy with a taste. | Got me across 4 states for a move on a motorcycle and had a great support experience afterward. | The search for addresses is pretty broken, the gos instructions aren’t great, and I had to turn off the audio because it Kept messing up my music. | Great algorithms for fun roads. Intuitive to use on the fly/ by phone to plan trip. Estimates for turns are a little off, but on the early side so at least still very usable. | Finds the best roads anywhere.  Just pick a direction, level of desired turns, and it works great.  For me that means hours of roads that are semi-turn with speeds between 35-55 mph.  Not sure how it finds these roads in such and endless fashion, but I am very happy it does. | This app is a huge piece of steaming dung!  I know of and have ridden several great rides in this huge country of ours and when I go to build them in this crap app more times than not it tells me it cannot find the road!  WHAT!  I’ve been on that road, I’ve enjoyed the twists and turns of that road and a biker ride app cannot find it!  What crap the app is!  I want my money back and you can keep this crap.  Couple of examples: Laughlin NV to Kingman NV, app says no road!  BULL!  I’ve driven it!  I look for a specific address, the crap app cannot find it. What the people built it and then hide it, come on crap app, get real. Super let down.  A bike app that can’t find a twisty road?  Crap app! | I want to love this app, it’s a great idea and looks very good.  I am having several issues with it though. 
1.  Don’t count on the app to reliably track your ride.  Most of the time I will look down to my black iPhone screen because the app has crashed.  When I reopen the app, it says recovery, and draws a straight line between where it crashes and where I reopen it.   

2. Navigation prompts do not line up to the map at all.   I hear turn left in 100 feet,  nothing but a cornfield for 2 or 3 miles.  Just to look down at the map and it did not have a turn designated at that point.

3. Other apps similar have friend functionality, challenges, and have built a better social experience in their app.  

I have not paid for the premium yet because anyone who would pay for an app when the “demo” or “free” version is this buggy. | I actually use these routes for scenic drives in my car. As such, I really wish they’d add Apple CarPlay support. Other than that, it’s an amazing app. | Finally an app that can suggest a really good route and lets you fine tune the route with waypoints to do it the way I want to go! | Gives you nice riding areas in your local area. If you want travel outside that area you have to $50 yr which is way too much. Deleted that app. | Love this app so far. Couple short rides. I love the explore option I’m just creating a random route the the location you’re at. I really enjoy the way you can build routes even within the app, very simple and picks good scenic routes. I wish you could search for locations like in other map apps & drop a pin, but that’s minor. I can’t wait to test out the off-line maps option, which if it works will be worth the premium price tag. More to follow. | Discovered this after a move.  Didn’t have to wait to find out all the best local routes.  Calimoto had them all.  Easy to create and explore new routes.  Love the ability to adjust curve level by route.  Insanely good app built by riders. | I purchased this for full price on android not knowing that it’s not account based. It’s app specific so my android money was wasted. The company told me to bring both phones with me if I want to still use it. 

I’ll find a better alternative that doesn’t charge $370 a year if you want to pay monthly. Enjoy my money from android. Not giving you guys anymore.

You charge $7 a week unless you pay in full which I did on the other platform. If you charged $4.99 a month none of this would happen. I’ve already found an alternative app That is cheaper than you guys and looks more visually appealing | So far I have found the route planning pretty easy and I like the navigation! 

The only problem I have and it’s a deal breaker is that it won’t let me select level 3 roads, which in my area are Forest service 3 digit roads that may be dirt or gravel.. so when I know I want to link a section together on my adventure bike it will not allow me to select the road and auto snaps point to a longer more maintained route. 

I wish there was an option to be able to select any road you want. | Gives great route suggestions.  I especially like the round trip capability!  So flexible, you can tweak the route to customize to taste.

Otherwise, only flying miles calculate, which is just not the best option to default to in my opinion.  Under the gear (preferences), there really should be a preferred method of transportation.

Calculations are pretty quick, and accurate, but no indication of route being used to calculate the mileage.  So, you have to break up your trip in smaller junks to get mileage for your intended route. Which really takes so d time and planning.

Second, selecting an entry to re-type a different location (city) is next to impossible.  I have to click at the end and the click delete multiple times to remove an entry so I can enter a different location.

It’s not a great app, but it does the job. | The app defaults to flying miles with no option for switching to driving. Please fix this. | I loved this app so much until recently. I always counted on it and it was priceless to me . Until I put in a location and wanted to see how far to my destination and all it shows is via flying. Some locations to a particular destination will work however, others only show via flying and the bar across the top only shows flying. You have no option to choose driving like I used to . I did delete app and reinstalled but the same problem. Ugh | The app no longer shows distance in miles - only inflight - totally useless now. | Hurry up! | I have been using Travel Math since I had my RV. Recently, Travel Math only calculates travel distance by plane without giving the option to compute my driving distance. If the app. Developers can fix this bug it would be greatly appreciated. | I also have been using this app for a long time and all of a sudden, it just uses flying. We drive all the time and want the driving choice back! | This app is good when it gives you the driving distance but  most of the time all it gives you is flying distance. This needs to be fixed. | I have used the Travel Math website for years to find the nearest airports to a city, and the app was similar.  Now you have to put in 2 locations which makes it more difficult. | First off I’ve been using this app for a few years now for truck driving. It usually works well. However, recently I’ve been noticing of the app automatically selecting flying miles to with no option to switch to driving miles. Not good! Example: picking up freight in Rockford IL and heading to Bonduruant, IA. 
The app automatically showed “flying” miles and there was no indication of driving mile calculation. I’m finding this happening more and more with this app.
I need “drive”miles calculated.
Please fix this or add an option to select  flying or driving. | This app would be great if it didn’t constantly revert to flying mode! This makes it useless for me | This app is now useless to me without driving distances. Thanks for removing. | This app has become useless to me.
I’m traveling 400 miles and it want to give me the flight distance. Who is it to decide I’m flying when I’m actually driving. I can’t find driving distance anymore. There needs to be a section in settings to decide between driving or flying | I have used this app very often and it has helped to provide me information to plan my trips. Mostly, I drive therefore I’m more interested in getting driving distances not flight distances, however very recently I discovered that in many instances the app shows only flight distances which surprised me that the ability to see driving distances is no longer available. I will be happy if this is reviewed and brought back. Thank you. | It can’t seem to find Fort Worth Texas or Arlington Texas Both in the same area code | Don’t get this stupid app which is designed for idiots. I used it but it very seldom worked, so I deleted it. | This app functions like a single use calculator.  It does not retain any information.  For example if you enter the trip information and click back, the fields are empty.  Also, you can’t share the details of the calculated expense and the app does not store the results of prior calculations. | Can’t enter precise locations using addresses or neighborhood names. Fine if you’re going from one city to another, but I need to calculate mileage based on location within my city. Not sure why this wasn’t anticipated. | It doesn’t load properly just sits and spins and when entering location all you get is error codes. | I’m not showing any costs for flight option. Did something change? | This app could be a lot better as most other people say. I searched for the distance between Budapest, Hungary to Kiev, Ukraine. For flights it said that the only direct flights are on Wizz Air. That is correct but Ukraine International Airlines has direct flights from Budapest to Kiev. Wizz Air uses Kiev-Zhuliany Airport while Ukraine International Airlines uses Boryspil Airport. 

Why does it show Wizz Air but not Ukraine International Airlines? I know it’s the same with most other flight routes you could input. | In my opinion, Two changes would make this app perfect.

1. There should be an option to use “my current location” as the starting point.

2. In calculating fuel required, the app forces one to use whole numbers for the vehicle’s MPG. It would be more accurate if fuel mileage could be entered to one decimal point.

If the developer is reading these reviews, please consider these suggested changes. | No longer pulls up location where you are. What’s up with that. All settings are correct. | I love this app! I agree it needs a little bit of work. I can’t yet my location to work.  But I use it all the time when I’m on a road trip. | I do a lot of road trips and often need to calculate more than one location at a time.  A “save trip” feature would be very helpful.  That way I wouldn’t need to keep putting in information as travel plans are changed. | I no longer get the location I am presently at to show up automatically on the “From” line. As good as this app was, it is now useless. What happened?????? | I’m having an issue with the app determining my location all of a sudden. 
This is something that just started about three days ago. I’ve uninstalled the app and downloaded it back to my phone. I’ve also reset my network settings on my phone trying to troubleshoot the issue but it still persists. Is this an ongoing issue that you guys are working on or has the app crashed or something? | No nonsense, simple app. Very nice. No advertisements. | Great idea on the surface to get a snapshot shot of long distance commute, however my travel always include tolls an estimate of that cost will be great. Needs that improvement | Please, bring this app, to the status of the online site and you will be the best. Right now, you are just another app, that's taking up space. Please, go back to the drawing board and redo this app. Thank you!!! | This app, as others have mentioned, lacks the online calculators that make TravelMath so helpful. If these calculators were added to the app, this would be a truly useful app; but until they are added, it's nothing that any other map or travel app doesn't already have.  I like the calculator online of cost to fly versus drive, and the ability there to change the factors, such as number of people traveling or how many miles per gallon your car gets.  These would be really useful on this app.  Hopefully there will be some updates soon! | Doesn't even give halfway point like the photo shows. Don't bother. No options other than from, to, miles, travel time and the map. It DOES give an estimate of gas cost which WAS helpful!!!  Keep working on it. | As a frequent traveler this is one of my essential tools. | It is a good app but could be a lot better!! I gave it two stars because it has somethings that could make it excellent in my opinion!! One is that it does not save an address. It always wants to go to your location even if you turn the locator off. Therefore if you are moving to another state say, it is a repeat process of, this is the address where I work, how far is it from this point ""A"" to this house at point ""B""!!! Small changes and I would rate this app a five star' | Doesn't take into account SPEED. JET STREAM. for example D.C. to Paris is going to be a longer flight than Paris to D.C. | No halfway calculation like it shows on the app description. | This app has no option to add the vehicle make and model so it can calculate the correct fuel consumption there for the estimated value of your trip is not correct if they were to add the option of the vehicle make model and year that would give you a more accurate estimate of what you fuel consumption would be | Would be nice if it allowed the speed to be modified. I'll just pull up the Calculater I guess. | Helped me out a lot with my trip planning | Good app to have to calculate distance and cost of driving. However, it does not have the other calculations available online such as cost to fly or drive. | Starting point about 375+ miles off. Won't let me reset. Useless | Perfect for the traveler who drives and likes to map out distances and reservations ahead of time. | I love this app.. It's really good if your thinking about taking a road trip somewhere and you'll know how much it'll cost to go. | I like the idea and the app, but it isn't fully useful to me yet. How about, in settings, you add a flight line like the ability to set speed? Puddle jumpers aren't  flying at 600mph so being able to set a realistic flight speed like 130 or 160 would help make app more usable. Yes, simple math but if you have to do it by hand, why use an app at all?

I do like how it picks the closet airport to my destination. I added a star just for that. | When I try to put in the city where I was traveling to it would not allow me to put in any city it doesn't work don't get it | No ability to set gas price, miles per gallon, or anything but the starting and ending points. It costs way more than $108.00 to drive a suburban from Seattle to Sacramento. | I like this app a lot!  It is a great quick way to get a round about idea of the distance to where you want to travel.  As far as gas expense, I don't think any app could pin point exact amounts, given traffic, speed etc.  Love this app!!! | Unless you Car gets 25mpg. | What more do people want?? USE YOUR GPS idiots if you want more info. I use it for motorcycle trips for mileage between cities between states, it does what it's made to do, does it great. Love It. | Can't change MPG calculation, would be nice if that could be customized on next update.",2.81013,79,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/93/0b/97/930b972e-3778-0d52-0974-78a04dbda6e3/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/3f/f9/22/3ff922a5-4940-0d2d-a863-2c56c139434a/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/0f/37/68/0f3768d4-5aa8-7b6c-3c32-ea5c93d8b3b7/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/41/ac/d0/41acd052-1459-da84-6641-424cffdeb4a2/pr_source.png/360x480bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/32/8f/64/328f647b-7040-aad8-0ae6-e16bba3b457d/pr_source.png/360x480bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple1/v4/2c/a5/8e/2ca58ef9-f66a-11dc-c177-07e872c1512d/pr_source.png/360x480bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone3GS-iPhone-3GS"",""iPhone4-iPhone4"",""iPodTouchFourthGen-iPodTouchFourthGen"",""iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi"",""iPad23G-iPad23G"",""iPhone4S-iPhone4S"",""iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen"",""iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G"",""iPhone5-iPhone5"",""iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen"",""iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen"",""iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G"",""iPadMini-iPadMini"",""iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G"",""iPhone5c-iPhone5c"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""Watch5-Watch5"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""WatchSE-WatchSE"",""WatchSECellular-WatchSECellular"",""Watch6-Watch6"",""Watch6Cellular-Watch6Cellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""Watch7-Watch7"",""Watch7Cellular-Watch7Cellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""Watch8-Watch8"",""Watch8Cellular-Watch8Cellular"",""WatchUltra-WatchUltra"",""WatchSESecondGen-WatchSESecondGen"",""WatchSESecondGenCellular-WatchSESecondGenCellular"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax"",""Watch9-Watch9"",""Watch9Cellular-Watch9Cellular"",""WatchUltra2-WatchUltra2""]"

Když už je celá aplikace offline tak i mapa by se hodila, aby mi to ukázalo spoj graficky. | This app sounds great, but after 30 days, San Francisco Database packs cost $9.99? I'd pay $9.99 if all the offline data was included. | i dont agree with other reviews there are some features in this app that make it perfectly nifty when fumbling around on the street trying to find your way. other apps dont have times you can input yourself . kudos to the developer | It would be a great app but it does not include detours for the bus. So you'll be waiting for the bus and realize that the bus has been detoured to another spot. It's then to late to make it to the other location. | This app is really nice, but it's completely idiotic to make us pay for what other transit apps offer for free. Instant delete. | I've been using this for over a year in Denver and it is easy to use and accurate. My go-to app for RTD info and getting around town. | Nice work good for me | Cannot open on iPad Air iOS 7.1.1... Keeps crashing on startup | I do not know if it is just me since using public transport in Czech Republic, but I guess there is no better application. | This app was great for routing our trip. Only thing it didn't do for me was, I wanted to put in an address and have it calculate the trip. We had to put in a stop to get directions and I just had to guess. | The latest update has made this app much worse than it was before. On top of many things being moved over to premium, it is very buggy. I use to love having this app, but now I bet there are better options. | Great app. Use it all the time. Love what they did with the update - great new interface, several nice new features. | Really handy app for planning future transit trips. Developer is super-responsive and resolved an issue I had same day I reported it. Highly recommended! | I loved this app until the latest update which now requires you to pay for the same features that it had in the previous version.  Very disappointed! However, I do love using this app to plan my trips because of the detailed route options. | The app keeps returning ""no routes found"" error no matter which points are chosen, no matter which bus or rail line, for LA Metro. I deleted the app from my phone and reinstalled (doesn't work). I deleted the schedule and reinstalled (doesn't work). The app just returns ""no routes found"" error. The previous app version worked quite well and I had thought about purchasing the schedule--boy am I glad I didn't. | As stated in other reviews, this app was perfect (save frequent destinations/addresses, easy to/from toggle, easy map lookup). 
Now those things are impossible or much more difficult! 
Please just bring the old app back! | I'm echoing other users' comments. After the recent update, I can no longer use this app to figure out my commute. 

Please fix it ASAP! | Bad bad bad, just will not work, a waste of time | Very disappointed. Do not update or you will be sorry. | This used to be a terrific app that was highly intuitive and a snap to use. Since the update I can't for the life of me figure out my routes. I thought spending some time with it would help, but even after looking up the well known routes that I regularly take, I couldn't make heads or tails of what it's trying to tell me. Please fix this app!! | Used to be a perfect transit app until this new update. It turned a simple and highly reliable app and made it something difficult to use. I'm disappointed. | Great App. Tells me where and when to switch trains to get to my destination by the appointment time. I drive 3 miles, catch the train, listen to iTunes, switch trains once and arrive at my appointment in time. Reverse order to get back. 60 mile round trip for $2. No sweat, no strain. Short of a private limo, this is hard to beat. Updated for train schedule changes. 
A good reason to have an iPhone. | I rely on SEPTA to get from South Philly to the King of Prussia mall 5 days a week for work. Therefore, I rely on this app everyday for my ever changing bartender schedule, and SEPTA's. Before I set my alarm, all I need to do is change the arrival day & time, and the app will tell me what time the subway leaves, when I will get uptown, how soon I have to be at the bus, and when I will arrive at work, with various options on routes and times on either side of my desired arrival time. With Septa being unreliable for one reason or another (traffic, maintenance issues, or whatever excuse a driver can come up with), it's nice to be able to chose a schedule that will get me to work a half hour early, or if I'm pushing the envelope, 5 minutes before my shift. I don't know what I would do with out this transit app. I've tried many others and they just don't fit my needs. This one is perfect for public transportation users, especially those who live in Philadelphia and are relying on connections/heading to the suburbs. Don't necessarily recommend this for intercity travel unless you're on a tight schedule, since the subways run every ten minutes, and popular bus routes the same or less. | BETTER than Google/RTD For Denver. Very happy with it. Too bad the Apple store cannot find it when searched by name. Has tons of cities it supports including Denver. It does have trouble with our trains downtown though as it has no concept of a line that loops at one end. It wants me to walk to the next station when I can just ride it around. Still, it's often more accurate than the signs above the trains at the stop. Even shows the route's map if you drill deep enough | Really off on BART schedule. Also Fremont Richmond doesn't mean Richmond bound apparently. This app has messed me up for the last time.
Deleting it after this review. | Good one and very useful for bus schedule. | Able to find the right bus/light rail in seconds in the Denver Area. | AMAZINGLY AMAZING TO HAVE AN APP THIS AMAZING. Buy buy buy | Well designed!! You've thought of everything. I love the map integration | Great app for all types of transit users.

GPS tracking helps a person know which bus, train and trolley is coming next no matter where they are. 

The old way one would have to search the routes and read the time table and figure out the closest area relative to the schedules via paper or Internet. 

I remember having to use multiple transit route schedule pamphlets store in my bag for quick reference. Now this app gives me instant reference to any route based on my GPS location.

This will be a great app if we can get real time bus tracking in addition to the schedules. This would be great when situations may cause route delays. | Does not show light rail schedules for Denver RTD. Always says ""No trips found"", even when explicitly specifying stations. | Provides more efficient choices in my travels by bus and rail in Denver than Google Map. I'm impressed. Like the option to catch the tighter schedules even if a bit risky. Raw but effective for advance users (people who ride more than twice a year). | Trying to use around Connecticut and NYC.  App cannot provide connections from grand central to JFK. It says no stations near there. Really?  Sorry I bought this. | This app is wonderful for Denver. I appreciate the ability to look up what buses are leaving from a certain location. | Best one out there | This app is very accurate and | I plugged in to get a route from home to work and got nothing.  I switched to a couple of intersections close to me and still got nothing. | app is ok but does not include the LA DOT DASH routes which is what I use mostly. | ...but that doesn't mean anything if the data isn't working. I live next to a bus stop in Denver, but no matter what I put into the app, it returns 'No trips found.' | I just could not do it without it! Easy GPS and tracking information And always up to date!! Loving it!! | It completely ignores my selected arrival time. So if I have to scroll down and load later departures and scroll down and load later departures until I find one close to the time I indicated when searching for the route in the first place. Seems like a pretty easy thing to fix...? | Google maps on the iphone was perfect. This app is useless. | Way better than official LA App! | Found one that works! | Accurate schedule. Simple and free! Great app.

ABOUT SHAKA GUIDE
At Shaka Guide our goal is to connect people with places. We love Hawaii. Not just for its beauty, but also for its rich history and culture. We believe that every destination has a story and we want to tell it. In Hawaii, we have over 20 audio tours that do just that - share the stories of the islands.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/3c/54/c7/3c54c780-73c1-23a3-ed44-ebf6bbb64e80/AppIcon-Oahu-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-10-0-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","156573696","12.0","2016-02-12T03:32:36Z","2024-04-26T13:26:44Z","Bug fixes and improvements","8.3.3",0,"USD",true,1275283409,"Shaka Guide","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/shaka-guide/id1275283409?uo=4","http://www.ShakaGuide.com",4.87219,"Add well worth $20.  Very informative, will highly recommend this app. | My sister and I decided to rent a car for our time in Waikiki so we would not be tethered to large group tours. When I found the Shaka guide, I was excited to use it but wasn’t 100% sure how it would work and how well it would work. From the second, I started my first tour I was blown away by how in depth the directions were, how entertaining and educational the stories were, and how delightful the presenter was. I would recommend this and will recommend this to everybody that I know that is heading to Hawaii and the other national parks. Thank you Shaka for making my Waikiki trip even better than what I thought it could be! | The app will not connect the car use GPS in the car system no matter what we try then we can’t access the tour information without it | A traditional island tour only you get to do it at your own pace tons of food stop and amazing beaches! Our family had a blast!! | This was our third time using the Shaka Oahu app and once again we loved it!  Our favorite is the North Shore Loop tour.  The tour made the drive fun again!  We were also able to share it with friends!  Great job! | Not enough forewarning on when to turn, even going 25 mph. Once off track, there’s no help getting back. Needs updates on roads. Some were closed. Some didn’t exist. Wouldn’t continue tour until you got back to missed spots (even though we couldn’t get to them). Very frustrating.  Waterfall hike was treacherous. Wear good shoes. Not for the out of shape. Nice gravel turns to big slippery rocks in a hurry. | His voice is very comforting all my kids were very entertain 
Everything it shows you is well worth it 
Thank you 🫶🏻 | It is a a good app to explore the circle with the family on a car rental. It is better than taking the tour. | Never had any connection issues or lags with the app.
Directions are so easy to follow and there is such a variety of stops.
The information is interesting and made exploring Oahu on our own with 3 kids a blast!!!!!Highly recommend. | My wife and I visited the islands and downloaded th app for Oahu to check it out and were so incredibly impressed that we decided to download it for each island we visited. We are still telling our friends and family about it a week later. Want a good guide at your own pace with clear directions and beautiful Hawaiian music playing to aid in enjoying the trip between stops? Then you found the perfect companion. Try one and I think you’ll do the same as us. Great job Shaka developers, you nailed it. | It’s our first time here and what an amazing app this was ! It took us a few minutes to figure it out but after that it truly was a blessing ! It shares all points of interest , parking , and information. Thanks for making our drive around the island fabulous! Tom and Mistey Texas ! | Used for years now…downloaded the full thingy for access to all island tours, as we’ve been hitting up diff islands last couple years. Parts are corny, but it really makes you feel like you left no stone unturned kinda thing when visiting new areas. Mahalo🤙 | Shaka Guide saved the trip! Had an amazing time using the guide to take my family around the island. Was able to learn a lot and a capture many historical jewels! Thanks! | I recently took a trip to Oahu and used the Shaka self-guided tour app for my sightseeing adventures, and I have to say, it was the best app ever! The app was incredibly user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it a breeze to plan my itinerary and explore all the island had to offer.

The app provided detailed information about each site, including historical background and interesting facts, which made the experience even more enriching. I particularly loved the feature that allowed me to customize my itinerary based on my interests and preferences. This gave me the flexibility to explore at my own pace and make the most of my time on the island.

The app was also very reliable, with accurate directions and maps that made it easy to navigate my way around the island. The audio guides were a fantastic addition, providing me with insights and commentary on the sites I was visiting.

Overall, I can't recommend this self-guided tour app enough. It truly enhanced my trip to Oahu and made it an unforgettable experience- especially Shaka the narrator.  We loved him and his sence of humor!  If you're planning a trip to Oahu, this app is a must-have! | Easy and accurate directions for driving. Very informative. Liked the stories and history. We enjoyed our day ! No stress or guessing. Loved it and highly recommend it! | Mahalo for the best app ever. We took both tours around Oahu and had the best time. This is my third time on the island, my fiancé’s first. He saw more in a couple of days, than I saw in all my other times. We were both impressed with all of the history of what we were seeing, as well as the music played. Thank goodness I found this, and didn’t pay some tour company $125 a piece for theirs. We loved being on our timetable, and being able to stay places as long as we wanted, or just move on, if it didn’t interest us. We will definitely use the other apps in the future, when visiting other islands. Wonderful job, guys. We recommend that everyone use this. It’s affordable, and very well worth a look. Especially if you are trying to see the whole island in the most affordable way ever. 🌴🤙🌈🏄🏻‍♀️ | Absolutely loved using the app for the North Shore Loop. Seeing the archway and the beautiful baby that was across from it was absolutely stunning and we would’ve never known about it unless it was for the app. I’d highly recommend this for anybody! | This is the 3rd Shaka tour we purchased. This was the best discovery, it has streamlined our vacations I can’t imagine doing one without it anymore! Gotta love not missing anything | If you were using your rental car to drive around the island, this is the app for you! It navigates you through cool places giving turn by turn directions, and taking you to things that you would never see if you didn’t know where you were going! This was a lifesaver! | Our family utilized this app on two separate trips to Oahu this year. We loved seeing sights we wouldn’t have known were along the way to our destinations and all the random tidbits of info we learned along the way. Highly recommend! | Fun, educational, good stops, and it just works.  Hooked it up to Bluetooth in the rental car and whole family enjoyed the tour. Way to go !! | The app took us to an awesome selection of places just locals know. The vocal interaction with the narrator felt quite natural. It was splendid like if the narrator was next to us. We highly recommend it. | What a great app! And so useful! | This app is just wonderful.  It is fun, informative, and amazingly accurate on directions. The app takes you to spots that we would never have explored otherwise, and it is just fascinating. | The best money we spent on Oahu!  A pre-recorded guided audio tour that links to GPS. Allows you to go at your own pace, even detour or backtrack while providing great local area info. M&C82 | Highly recommend this app for a fun, informative, and incredible self guided tour. The map tracking works great downloaded while driving even in low or no service areas. Thank you for taking the time to create such an awesome product for us visitors! | Made the drive around Oahu a truly great experience! | I just got back from my 2 week honeymoon and used the Shaka app multiple times throughout our tip and it was awesome! I loved being able to do things at our own pace and spend how much time we wanted at each stop. I loved learning about the island and the names of the formations off shore. The music that played in between stops was great. Every time we got in the car and forgot to continue the tour my Husband would ask where the music was. Highly recommend. | I had pulled this app down when it first came out. I thought it was useful. I opened the app, unwittingly chose to upgrade and got locked out of the app, and needed to pay to use it now. There should have been a warning. I am Kama Aina and I won’t be using this anymore. | The Shaka Gide tour of Oahu was amazing and would highly recommend to anyone visiting | Well, that are rated, is it from instructions. Going to tomorrow I’ve ever done, and it was also a lot of fun. | Kids got got us on a late start, had to change plans last minute.  The Tour guide in Maui actually uses this app on the tour bus.  Told us to try it.  

So a couple days later in Oahu, late for lunch and all our plans are messed up..  

Like $10 later and a couple minutes of down load, I went from no plans and crazy kids...  To a self guided tour of the island and kids in back of the rental car.   A nice relaxing 5 hours around the island.  With the Shaka App tour guide using GPS to tell me where to drive, when to turn, what to look for, what we can do when we get there, let's us skip things, and tells us history and stories.

Instead of dragging around kids walking wakiki - I got a relaxing drive and virtual tour with amazing scenery and some great places to visit while the kids did whatever on their phones in the back seat.  

Sometimes kids make things hard.   But the virtual tour guide saved my day in Oahu by being on demand, flexible, affordable, and helpful.

If you don't get a chance to plan for a trip to Hawaii.   A simple rental car and this tour guide app can keep you busy for several days and you'll enjoy it.  

This app made a crazy stressful day an easy relaxing 5 hours of sight seeing.  Gave us bathroom stops, good food stops, great photos and off the beaten path views. | I have loved using Shaka. It has been a life saver on my trip and has been awesome to learn the history of the island from.  Would recommend 11/10. | I had never been to Hawaii and my cousin recommended this app and he lives on Oahu!!!! This was better than I expected and well worth the cost of the app.  I love love loved the narration in the app and the stories about the island.  If you have any doubt about this app, don’t because it does not disappoint. | I was excited to download the North Shore driving tour before we hit the road to North Shore. It took several hours to complete, and yes, I had WIFI at our hotel, 4 hours later it still said processing. So I decided I couldn’t hold up our day any longer and left for our drive to North Shore. Messaged the app and I was told to uninstall and reinstall that sometimes this happens with certain phones, I have an iPhone with AT&T, 🙄 nevertheless I was no longer in a WIFI area and said forget it, give me my money back, sent the receipt as they requested, Apple sent me a refund. North Shore Tour still says processing, obviously they have issues with their North Shore tour, super disappointed because I heard such great things form a travel group I’m part off.  My advise if your going to do this tour, do it several days before you plan to do the tour so you have time to monkey with it if it doesn’t work. | Awesome guides to show you around. Used it in Oahu, loved it. Downloaded for Kauaii and Big Island. A few spots were a bit off but its to be expected that some places evolve or get overrun. Found a few additions along the way, you guys have to consider revisions and updates in the near future. 

Have recommended this guide to friends and the hotel manager where we stayed. Concept and execution are spot on! Thanks guys | I have been in the island > 4 times and this app worht the $ i payed for. Learned a lot about my adventures and easy guide to follow. Appreciated the narration along the way of the tours and used all but one on the tour package avaulable. Love it! 
Thank you | We absolutely love this app!  I had been to Hawaii before and opted to do a lot of guided tours, the Shaka guide was so much better!  It allows you to be on your time at your pace without sacrificing the education from a tour guide. Thank you and I can’t wait to try the other guides! | This App is amazing !  We down loaded it for our Oahu vacation .   It saved us tons of money in pricey Tours and gave us the opportunity to explore the island at our own pace.   The “virtual guide”  was funny and very knowledgeable.  
We most definitely will use this app again on our next vacation and will recommend it to all our friends. | Easy to follow and lots of fun. This was my wife and I second trip to Oahu. We used your busses last time, which was okay but for us Shaka was way better. We cannot wait for our next trip and more tours. Mahalo Shaka | Y’all this was way better than getting on a tour bus and having to stop at places you may not want to. The guide is also very much about that food life so if you’re into tons of options to try out local food, fruit and drinks then this is for you. Purchase the tour bundle with the 25% off code and it’s almost the same price as one tour! We’re gonna do our Waikiki walking tour next- you won’t regret downloading this app! | This app is SO GOOD!  Directions are easy to follow and I was never confused.  Never had a signal problem.  The information is interesting, the music is fun and I love the stories about the names of things.  No matter how early you start the driving tour, you will wish you had more time.  I bought all 6 tours and am working my way through them.  Best $$ I have spent!!  It is so well done! | I stumbled across this app while searching for excursions for my upcoming Waikiki Hawaii trip. As all excursions were costing roughly $100-$200 per person it was making this trip seem very limited in my exploration of the Island!! This app has allowed me to compare if buying The city pass Oahu is worth it or not! I definitely won’t be paying for any of the expensive tours now!!! This app is saving me a lot of money and giving me a lot more of Hawaii! Thank you very much Shaka! | I bought all of the tours but only used 3 of them, still a fantastic value considering a tour bus Grand Circle Island tour is over $100 per person and you can’t control how much time you spend at each spot. A little disappointed that the Rainforest tour was not usable due to a closed road.  Great history and commentary. Great directions. It was magical how the guide knew where we were and would start speaking at the exact right time!  Going to Maui in 2023, totally getting the Shaka Maui tours too! | Excellent value for money…. My husband is “nervous” driver and he relied on and loved the driving directions given on the app.  Advance notice of turns / sites plus interesting stories about what we were seeing and history.  Worth the money!!  Great app… thank you…. Headed to Maui end of week and I’ll be purchasing Maui Shaka Guide🌴🌴 | If you are new to town and have no idea what to check out, I recommend getting this app! The east side shore is the program I went with and the guide took us to super cool locations. The directions were clear and I love the voice behind it! Thank you guys for making this app. | Just used the app for three days of exploring Oahu.  The app worked perfect and so easy!

Highly recommend those that like to explore at their own pace! | Must have it!! | My wife and I had been to Hawaii almost 20 years ago (pre kids) and wanted to share some of the great spots we found with our kids this trip.  However, so much had changed and we had limited time to see and do the best stops in Maui and Oahu, so glad we found this app as it was absolutely priceless in pointing us to all the best stops and helped to make things stress free as we didn’t have to agonize over whether we were missing anything we would later regret not stopping for. The Shaka app does a great job of pointing out all the best spots you would want to stop with limited time! | Phenomenal app!…we did the eastern shore tour and absolutely loved it.

It was like having your own personal tour guide…he had the local touch, was engaging, provided fantastic directions that I barely had to look at the GPS, and had a lovely sense of humor…there were times we burst out laughing listening to him during the trip…

An experience worth having and worth EVERY penny.

Can’t wait to do the other tours. It was that awesome….

Only suggestion I’d have - make it apple car play

Lumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. 

“I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza

The beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! 

Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. 

Designed exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.

So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? 

Track it and get things done!

Avoid updating. Literally turned to ransomware. Shall complain to Apple.

Update will block this app access and force you to download a new Daily Tracker app OR you must pay a yearly subscription of $40. | Deleting App | Perfect in every way ! | Initially, I didn't ""get"" how useful this app truly was because of its deceptive simplicity...but the more I use it, the more it is everything I've hoped for! I’m not sure how the updated paid version would be of more help given the way I’ve been using the former version, but as is Lumen Trails is indispensable. | Excellent App. | Downloaded this game to check it out, somehow it subscribed me for an entire year making me pay 9.99 and I didn’t ok that. So just be careful! | I like this app and have used it for various and changing purposes. I like that there are templates so I don’t have to re-create the wheel for commonly tracked habits (like exercise) but I also like the flexibility to create my own trackers and chose options like yes/no or 1-10, etc | Love this app for keeping track of important information for my business and other things. 

Easy to customize and been using it for years. 

Thanks devs! | I love being able to make lists and attach pictures.  For Christmas we make lists for the kids and can text them to grandma and grandpa with all the details.  It makes things really smooth and easy for the holidays! | I have been using Money Tracker for just over 4 years now. I use it mainly for my stock trading.
I also use it for Shopping lists, reflections and  
Todo lists.
Well worth the download! | I was looking for a simple way to keep a journal. I haven't explore all possibilities but 
I wish I could open it on a browser and safe and download the content so I can archive it. I wish it was something like Evernote where you can store it and if you change phones you don’t loose the data. | Nothing like how the app was advertised. Very disappointed. | This is the most user friendly tracking app ever. | Not free | This app is a bit fuddy-duddy, and has not been updated in a long time. However, it gets the job done, albeit with some very confusing nonfunctional buttons and limited, counterintuitive entry methods.  I am trying to use the ""bedtime"" template to track my rise time each morning. However when I tap the ""Add current time"" to the journal entry field, this does not update the time field in the upper right-hand corner. The user is forced to manually click and type in the time.  Otherwise, the time will not show up on the monthly calendar view for tracking purposes.  Unfortunately, the task of manually entering a time presents new challenges and limitations.  For example, if I type in 500, this gets interpreted as minutes, converted to hh:mm format and shows up as ""8:20"". Or I would need to type ""7"" "":"" ""0"" ""3"", to get 7 hours, 3 minutes.  There is no way to indicate a.m. or p.m. for these entries, which I suppose is not crucial, however it would be nice.  After all, it is possible to get a.m. and p.m. in the journal entries, so why not in the main data entry field in the upper right-hand corner?  The plus and minus buttons do not serve any function in this template, which is confusing.  When I press them, my data entry gets deleted and replaced by a ""+"" or a ""-"".  It is a steep learning curve for such a simple app, and the functionality is still lacking in many ways.  It is a promising app because of its versatility – it is a great idea to have an app that can track just about anything.  However it needs some re-tweaking of the user interface, as well as some serious rethinking about the various ways in which people would want to use an all-purpose tracking app. | See review title | 😍💀🏡 | This is the app I use most. Almost infinitely flexible - you can use this to track just about anything. It's impressively stable, and the sync and backup options are great. | I'm an entrepreneur and I use this to track my daily/weekly income and expenses. It's easy and intuitive. Sometimes it gets weird when you try to edit. But other than that, I love this app! | Overall recommended 👍👍👍

Other thought...  initially no ad then a few months ago saw ads so I stop using it.  I just looked again seemed no ad.

My advise price it reasonable so sell in volume, ad thingy is a big turn off. | I use this app pretty much every day to keep myself organized. Love the password feature for sensitive info too. | Downloaded the app to find that it has the same features as free apps, although you have to pay $10/year for this. Now trying to cancel it, there's no explanation on how to and there's no where to find how to cancel it.
I now have to email the company to cancel my subscription that i had to agree for before i even tried out the app. | I really like this app, but there are a few suggestions I have that would really increase my enjoyment of it. 

1) For recurring tasks, I wish there was a way to set a custom schedule. For instance, I have tasks I need to do on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, but the closest option I can get for scheduling is Every Two Days, which doesn't work with our weeks having an odd number of days. I also wish there was a way to filter my view to only show tasks due those particular days, and the ability to have a link note for each task, for instance to open an Evernote note with more details. (I've been using Fantastical somewhat successfully for this, but would like to pull these goal-oriented tasks into a more trackable arena.)

2) It's petty, and I know they're very proud of the icon, but I just don't like it. It looks very outdated next to the other app icons on my screen, to the point that I'm almost embarrassed to have it on my front Home page, and indeed I cringe every time I see it there. I just wish it was more modern or conceptual or something, rather than just being the footprints. 

3) Also concerning the icon, I wish there was an option to change the color of it in Settings rather than having to download another version of the app, which makes me nervous about retaining all the info I've plugged into my current version (even tho I do have it synced with iCloud).

4) The icons for the included list templates are nice, but I'd like to have an option for customizing the icons for lists I create. As it stands now, the icons for my lists based on templates give me a nice visual indication of what it is, but my created from scratch lists are generic and visually difficult to differentiate. 

Otherwise, it's a really versatile app for any number of things, and the more I mess around with it the more useful I find it to be! | The old version is great, but I for one HATE ads & subscriptions even worse! I would have bought a new version without ads, but now I won't buy anything by the developer. Looking for good replacement, please advise here to help others! | DO NOT UPDATE. Update has suddenly reverted to visible ads on a PAID IOS app, and changed the terms to a $2/month subscription to turn them off. Egregious behavior on the part of the developers and little diffferent than the extorting malware that holds your data hostage and exposes it to ad network security issues. Shame on you! | Congratulations Lumen Spark. You now rank as the most unethical company I have experienced in the Apple Store. You have destroyed this app, and any good will you may have had previous to this sabotage. | La verdad se merece un CERO bien grande.

La aplicación en si no es mala, pero la empresa, con todo respeto es de lo peor que yo he visto. 

En su momento yo obtuve la aplicación que costaba $19,99 use una promoción y no pagué ese monto, pero desde que sacaron las versiones nuevas, las que cobran un importe mensual, han venido desmejorado la aplicación (en mi opinión la han reducido), y hoy me encuentro con que le hicieron otro cambio, le metieron publicidad, y resulta qué hay que pagar $1,99 por mes para quitarla, me parece muy poco profesional, muy poco ético y muy desleal. En su momento ganaron cuando uno compro la app y ahora quieren ganar de nuevo pero no con una mejora. 

En mi caso buscaré otra aplicación qué hay muchas y mejores 

Saludos | Introducing monthly fees for a previously paid (and expensively paid) app is a fiasco. A so-called developer should DEVELOP a different NEW product, and establish such scheme for its new creation, not steal the one already sold and try to make people re-pay for it. Shame on Lumen Trails. | You used an update to put ads in an app I had already paid for? And then you want to charge a monthly fee to get rid of them. 
Why would I trust you with any more money? Very sleazy practice. | [Edited from 5 stars to 1 star due to adds in a paid app: the apps aren't cheap - $19.99, but now you also have to pay a monthly subscription of $1.99 a month to remove adds. I've used this app for years and am extremely upset at these unethical shenanigans - let old users skip your updates, or grandfather us in to not have to pay an indefinite monthly fee - totally unacceptable. I will be looking for alternatives.]

Lumen Trails: Most Versatile App
Lumen Trails' limits are your imagination, you can create all kinds of:
1. Checklists (groceries, projects, to do)
2. Tracking (time, expenses, budgets)
3. Notes (journaling, personal inventories of books, CDs, collections, virtual smash books)

You can insert reminders, pictures and sound files into any of the above. Back it up on the cloud, PIN protect the app, transfer data wirelessly to a computer or Google drive.

There's likely more that I haven't done yet, too.

I picked the one with the app icon color I liked the best; this is one of very few apps worth a hefty price, but know that each one seems to do all the same things - they just highlight or give examples of budgeting, time tracking, etc. | I purchased this app in past. The update now gives me ads and wants a monthly payment. Like the app but not enough to pay 2 bucks a month. | By far the best app i have ever used very detailed and simple
LOVE IT!! | Gives enough flexibility to track almost anything. | On my iPhone 4S, there's great delay when writing long words. | 🙏🏻👍🙌🙏🏻👍🙌 | The app is very flexivle. | Seems pretty good so far. I'm still working out the details on how to use it correctly. | Lumen Trails is a great app for multitasking. I really enjoy using it to keep my busy life on track! | While this did say there were in-app purchases, this only allowed me 7 entries for free. To do anything beyond that I had to purchase the app. I thought I would get a little more  use out of the ""free portion"" so beware that this isn't really a free app - it's more like a free trial. I thought it was a little challenging to figure out but I think I was just getting to know it better when I couldn't use it any further. | Lumen Trails is a great app. Keeps my life on the right path, organizing my hectic day to day schedule. Highly recommended!! | Very useful. | Out of the list apps this has been useful, efficient, and fun to use! Keep it up. | I've downloaded all of the applications and noticed at the bottom of the list on the left that you could unlock all categories for $4.99. I expected that to not only unlock all of the categories in all of the applications, but combine them all into one. Yeah, guess not. Thanks for the waste of five dollars. | Lumen trails is an amazing organizational app. I was looking for a simple solution for a budget on my phone. I expected to find something that would be a good stopgap until I was able to get to my computer. I was blown away by the complete solution that lumen trails offered. Highly recommend. | I've been needing this in my life for along time. | The simplicity of the app is one of it's best features. It's user friendly, and easy to input as well as find date. Makes life easier! | I have a deep connection with this app. It helped me path my way to success. And let me manage my time better. | Though it appears, at first, rudimentary, it's pretty useful and uncomplicated. I've found it very much grows on me as I use it more and more. | It is fairly simple but they do a great job of placing analytical information behind the simplicity for when needed. I hope they expand the financial aspects in future updates but it's already a fairly powerful tool.

Thanks Mark Off! Just starting to use your multitude features… | Unable to add widget to Home Screen | I had to erase my phone and install everything without a backup (backup would bring back the problems I was having).
The app has a sync option even in the free version! That saved me big time.  Otherwise I would have lost all my data. 
Thank you for having it sync even in the free version! | I’ve tried every diet out there and the most sane normal diet is the NO S diet. It’s just normal eating. This app works the best at tracking easily. Thanks so much for this simple easy app! | Great | Believe it or not once you learn how to use this app it is FANTASTIC. I try a ton of apps and most dont stick. This is SO USEFUL. I use it to track everything. I love that you can hand write each day and create your own symbols for things. The act of writing with your fingers must release some brain chemicals because i look forward to marking my sleep, my diet, my exercise minutes and quality. And i can spot trends at a glance with the monthly view. Plus so much more. The potential for this app is even bigger!   I could go on and on but dont take my word for it!  (Yes i have a vested interest in writing this review = i want the creator to sell more units so he is motivated to make it even better. Plus they deserve some kudos on this work) | If the free version deletes four months of my progress I’m not likely to convert to a paying customer. | The most recent update does not show my crossed out days for the month on the month calendar view. I thought my info was totally gone at first glance. If I tap on the individual day my red “x” shows up, but that is extremely cumbersome and annoying. I was using this to keep track of something important!

Update: It is now working again after another update. | I tried to give private feedback, but the button for that doesn’t work so unfortunately I have post here. Two stars for a great idea!! I was really excited about this! But there’s something wrong with the user interface. I made an activities calendar, added the first activity, then got stuck. My only options were to delete the activity I just made, make a new calendar, or go to settings. It’s unusable because of this glitch I’m afraid. | Love the amount of options for crossing out. App doesn’t crash and it’s simple to use | Great app | Want to love this app so much. It’s a simple but brilliant idea. Would be an amazing app if a few bugs were fixed. Set up is not very intuitive and I paid for the premium subscription to remove ads but every time I access the app through my widget the ads are back and I have to go into the settings to click “restore purchases”. It’s minor, but I’m paying to not have to see the ads. | Ghbh | It’s so simple to use and I love the ability to add multiple things for each day. I’m having trouble however adjusting activities after I’ve set them once. What’s the best way to do this? | Update: I love the ""Activities"" feature! You can assign colors to activities, place multiple colors/activities on one day, and see activity statistics! :-) 

Victor, thank you, thank you, thank you for this app! I am visually impaired, and was surprised to find that this app is fully accessible with VoiceOver. It's EXACTLY what I have been looking for: a calendar where I can draw on the dates. Just to share an idea: I track my mood and energy levels in my journal with emojis. Now I will be able to draw each day's averages and better see trends! Thanks so much again! | Great app works perfectly | Terrific reward system for keeping yourself honest. | Really fun to use | This is the only app of its kind and it’s amazing. It works exactly how I needed it to, in order to get through my shifts at work. Now I can count down the days and remember: there’s an end in sight! | Amazing if you want to keep track of, for example, how many days you have been eating healthy. But, there should be a way to just check off a day, instead of having to go into each day on the calendar and coloring it. | I’ve been using this app to track habits for six months and was very happy with it. Updated: the app creator was very responsive to my report of bugs, and they have been fixed. 

This app is ideal for what I need, a simple calendar to mark down habits and review a month at a glance. | I’m not sure what happened to the app. I use it to keep up with streaks for breaking bad habits. Now when I go to a day to add to my streak, it won’t save no matter how many times I try; or if I click on the current day, it will default to a previous day & I'm unable to add to my streak | The streak calendars have been working great. However, the chapters in the life calendar aren’t allowing me to have any of them start or end before the day I downloaded the app (for example, I can’t put a chapter from 2015-2019). 

Update: There is a small bug that makes it not possible to set or edit the start dates. It’s pretty easy to work around by 1) typing the start date in the slot for the “end date” which will automatically input the same date into the “start date” slot, and 2) changing the “end date” slot to the real end date—the start date will not change. | This is exactly what I needed to track multiple goals and intentions. Great design. Exactly what I wanted! | Just what I have been searching for, A digital calendar that I can cross off. It’s something about checking things off a list, that makes me feel as though I have really accomplished something. Thank You ! Yes I will gladly pay the $4.99. | This app is exactly what I wanted. Great development and interface. Love this so much | Love this calendar 📅 I can strike out in red. Love it and it's worth paying 4.99 for no ads!! | I love this calendar app and thank you for making it, I highly recommended. 

Developer: I prefer Sat as end week and Sun as beginning week. My cal is set this way. But widget never displays it.

Reply back to developer: I tried that it didn’t work.

Update: it’s working fine now after latest version... thanks! | Two thumbs up | The app is good but it’s not what I’m looking for. I need an app with a widget that will showcase streaks. For example, I want to see my duolingo and memrise streak on one widget on my home screen, but this only shows a calendar on the widget rather than the streak. | Awesome calendar to cross out the days your workout. Very motivating to see so many days that you’ve worked out in a row. Keep up the excellent work! | A straightforward and very effective app for this need. I’ve used the app as a great motivator to read more and also for other behavioral monitoring. Viktor also provides excellent customer service, even implementing functionality based on feedback. I’m impressed and this is just what I needed. | I needed a calendar to check off days. No note taking, no scheduling, nothing fancy. Just a clear visual of all of the days I’ve visited the gym. This app is perfect. | How do we cross things out? | After many futile attempts at finding an app which can provide an easy and efficient substitute for my white board calendar, I came across this marvelous and impeccably designed app! I downloaded numerous amounts of gratuitous calendar apps which all failed to provide the proper function and navigation tools I require. However, upon discovering this masterpiece, I swiftly deleted all that irrelevant junk. Needless to say, I am overjoyed with this creator’s work and hope to continue supporting this superb product.

The ONE to Ride regional transit app is a personalized navigation tool that allows you to plan and manage your trip on Local bus, Park & Ride bus, METRORail or METRORapid. It requires a cellular network or wireless connection.

By allowing the app to access your location, you’ll see:
• Nearby bus, rail and METRORapid routes
• Real-time arrival estimates for nearby buses and METRORapid vehicles
• Scheduled arrival times for nearby trains

You can plan your trip by tapping an icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

The app’s unique My Stop technology then connects with thousands of beacons in the METRO service area to deliver notifications or pulse vibrations when you’re approaching your:
• Starting bus stop, METRORail or METRORapid platform
• Transfer point (if applicable)
• Destination bus stop, METRORail or METRORapid platform


Just plan your trip and watch or listen to your phone to monitor progress.

It also will only show one arrival when clearly I'm near a bus stop. | Great visualizations of local routes, but should also include Park & Ride Routes. Ideally, this should be combined with the QTicketing app to have a 1 stop app. | The app is very nice! 
It helps me to know when to start going to the bus stop but Only problem I have is it doesn’t show if a bus is delayed or not. It always lights green when the bus is on time or near but it never tells you if it’s late | This is a great and very useful app but sometimes it has its issues. Currently one of the issues is that when I try to plan a trip a few hours ahead, it won’t let me adjust the time. It only gives me the option to tap on the current time. | This app was so confusing and not helpful at all. Already deleted it and would not recommend. | Why isn’t the app working | This app told me my bus was gonna arrive at 10:45 but failed to mention the detours that the bus had to take leaving me stranded for 30 minutes | I found this app very helpful. It allowed me to get to school. There were a couple of times within the 3yrs that used it when buses were running late or wouldn’t show up at all, so I wish Metro could keep this app updated with that info. Other than that i thought it was pretty easy to use and helpful. | This app always have incorrect bus times. Not reliable. Makes me late for work | There’s two different times; “Live” and “Scheduled” .Half of the times, the Live time becomes scheduled, and before you know it, bus doesn’t pass and you’re already waiting at your stop for no reason.... | This app is very inaccurate. Unless the bus is a ghost, I don’t see them at the stop when the app says arriving in 1 minute then it quickly jumps to arriving in 14 minutes. I don’t think it tracks the actual bus, but rather just follows the bus schedule. | There are no words to describe how frustrating it is to needlessly stand in the rain for twenty minutes because this app has gives no alert when the busses/trains stop running. | App was reasonably accurate until one day it just stopped giving estimated or scheduled times. | Most of the time the app works fine sometimes it freezes or crashes. | This app is fairly accurate until it isn’t. I’ve seen arrival/schedule times jump up and down witching seconds of inquiring of the next arrival. It doesn’t really warn you of unexpected delays as they happen. Difficult to stay close to approximate times as well when most but not all bus drivers are diligent to stay on schedule. | It shows where the busses are located at exactly (the green busses) are the ones you want to search for to know when the next one will be approaching your bus stop. Sometimes, there are delays but it should still be accurate and not far off. I like this app is VERY convenient to get around especially if you are on a time bind. It will tell you specifically when the next bus is coming even if a delay happens. Y’all should get this app if you guys ride the Metro. Super convenient honestly. It shows you the routes the bus number is taking and the path and all the stops etc. If you are lost this is another way to quickly find where you are. It’s like a GPS as well as a bus scheduler put into 1. | The 412 is never where the GPS says it is.  Very frustrating when you are trying to get to work on time :( | Real time data in text format only and it didn’t seem to change as the bus moved. Show me a graphic: map with bus icon. Doesn’t allow user to filter out the routes of no interest. | This app is a joke. It tells you when trains/busses are SCHEDULED to arrive, not when they actually do. For instance, according to the app, the train just left the station I am sitting at. In reality, no train came. Other cities like DC have had apps that tell you exactly where the bus is and have had them for YEARS. I don’t understand why Houston can’t have that. | It’s been a few months now but this app doesn’t time the buses accurately anymore... it’s off by over 5 minutes .. not Real Time ... I recommend you text Metro “Bus Stop #” and you will get a return message is closer to real time by 2-3 min | All this app is missing is the ability to differentiate which bus is which on routes that have 2 different destinations. Such as 137 Eastbound. Before the complete overhaul of the app, it would say whether it was the Maxey Rd. P&R or just the Denver Harbor TC bus. | The trip planner is super inaccurate and unreliable. You're waaaay better off just using a Maps app and picking the transit option since it seems to understand how to efficiently connect bus routes better than Metro itself | I can't say enough how horrible this update is. I loved this app until recent update took ""favorite station"" away. Now I can't add any bus route or station to check it when I needed. Horrible update! I want the previous 2.0 version back! | The realtime arrival function needs improvement. A bus may be reported arriving in 5 minutes only to drop off the list of realtime arrivals which then says the next bus is 22 minutes away. So what happened to the bus that was set to arrive in 5 minutes when I rushed out of my office to catch the bus? | Can't get out of window and go back to my bus | I just tried this today. Seems to work great. I could even see my bus was on the map as it was coming towards me. | This app gives the impression that it can tell you how long before a bus bus arrives. It doesn't. You're better off waiting idly at the bus stop. Both god and Houston busses seem to move in mysterious ways. | I have been using the Metro Trip app for awhile and this latest update has me missing the previous version. I lost the ability to plan my trip which I use to decide my mode of transportation. It was also helpful when trying to get to & from Metro stops it is so frustrating trying to see which routes cross in order to take the most convenient one to my destination. Now I'm forced to do an internet search which is frustrating when I have the Metro app already installed on my phone. | If you haven't updated the TRIP app to this new version, don't. The old version is already bad enough, but the new one is even worse. After you click one button, it won't allow you to go back to other function, so you have to completely exit the app to do so. The real-time tracking is a joke - it's very inaccurate and made me miss my bus multiple times. | This is a typical case of don't fix if it ain't broke. I used the app regularly before leaving the office to check if my bus is delayed but with the updated version the favorites were eliminated and the new map feature doesn't replace that at all. I deleted the app and would give 0 stars if it were possible. | This new update is awful. It was working okay at first but not close to how easy the last version was. Please fix this thing. It won't even give me the correct routes anymore. Won't save my frequent locations. Tries to send me on two hour routes when there are 30 minute options I already know of(thank god)... | So... apparently it defaults you to D.C., which isn't ideal. There is now way for it to find ""you"". I live in Houston, and I would like to be able to save my bus stop and see when my bus will get to that specific bus stop. This is not user friendly. I DON'T CARE WHAT BUS IS NEAR D.C.! I need to know where my bus is and if it is on time. I want the old app back, or seriously fix this one NOW! | This update is horrible! The functionality is very bad. You can't save the stops. | Why change it? Previous version much easier to use & understand! | Don't fix what's not broken | This app no longer works with the new update. I tried reinstalling it and now it defaults to DC. I need this to get to work everyday since the buses are never on time in Houston. Now I'll have to try to guess when the bus will arrive or wait at the stops for 20 minutes. I would rather have the old Stone Age app that worked than this. | The routes no longer load, and that's with full LTE signal. | New upgrade made app dead and not usable | Not working!!! | No longer functioning even if you try to delete and install the app again. | I can't say enough good things about what you guys have done to this app.  Took it out of the stone ages and really make it practical and useable.  Thank you!  Great work! | If you have not done the update, DON'T!!!!!!
Absolutely horrible. You will lose all your favorites. Default location is D.C.  Not user friendly. There doesn't appear to be a way to delete recent trips, so if you look up a wrong stop, it will stay in your recent trip log. | Don't know why this app got such low ratings. It tells the time when the bus arrives and the time I will be at my destination. It also plans my trip for me. There is one thing, please always continuous make the app better.

Update 9/2/16:
Down grade from a 5 to a 4. This app is not entirely accurate. Told I needed to wait 20 minutes for the next bus. I was about to turn back and just drive. Then a new bus arrived. I had to run to catch it. | App does not work all of the reviews are right. I thought it would be different for me but it wasn't horrible app!!!! | Real time tracking is not accurate at all. A waste of phone memory in my opinion. Thumbs down on this one | I thought people were exaggerating, but no this app literally does not work. I just get an error message when I try to plan a trip. None of the functions work. This is very disappointing because for someone who is not familiar with the Metro system, there is no way to select which bus or rail to take without getting on s physical computer and studying different maps, routes, and times. They need to take this app offline until they fix it. | This app is horrible. I couldn't even plan a trip. It kept popping up as an error. | I've never been compelled to write a review for an app before but the functionality of this app is so terrible I felt I needed to say something about it. When trying to ""plan a trip"", you can type in your starting point and destination but there is no way to make the on screen keyboard minimize so you can load the results (on iOS this is).

Most recent trip last week, the map went blank. All saved places still there but no streets or saved stars show up in the screen. Is anyone else experiencing this and would someone please help me troubleshoot this? | We really appreciated this app as a handy tool on our trip to Paris and highly recommend it to others for their journeys! | Nice app. It would nice if I could share or export this to my wife’s phone AND when I have a category.. for example… “Markets”, when I click on the map to locate that market, the map only show the markets I have saved and not all the other point of interests I’ve saved in other categories. | I used to love this app, but now… The search function is terrible, and the Metro map outdated. It doesn’t even list the RER C line, which is kind of a big deal. And if you search for “notre” or  “notre dame”, you get no results. Need to type “notre-dame” to find anything. No longer my go-to app for Paris. | This App has helped us present our vaccination status while traveling throughout Europe. The convenience of having the entire family in just a couple of swipes. Although it’s good to have your original record as backups (never had to use) this is the recognized solution while traveling in many places throughout Western Europe. | I found this app for my second, and his first trip to one of the most beautiful places in the world. As I did my research, I bookmarked all the landmarks, restaurants, cafes, gardens, hidden passages and patisseries that looked interesting, with notes and links to the review or menu. It was so helpful as we wandered the city, to look at the app to find, “hey, we’re just around the corner from…” I told so many people about it. 

Now, 2 years later, as we plan another trip, it seems buggy. The map keeps disappearing. I go to see a location I pinned, and nothing. I uninstalled the app and readdded it and it worked for a while, but is broken again. We leave in a week. I hope it works. | I love this app because I am going to Paris in 3 or 4 years with my gramma so we are in the middle of planning the trip so I love your app because it helps me be organized.

We used it the entire time we were in Paris since it gave me real-time gps walking/navigation location so I could figure out directions - offline. Seriously, this app was a LIFE SAVER! We intended on using the Metro during most of our stay, which this app also give “closest metro stops” to sites, however with the strikes going on we basically walked the city. We couldn’t have done it without the help of this app. Before our trip I downloaded it & starred/saved all our points of interest we planned on visiting. While we were in Paris, I remained offline -didn’t use my data - and this app was still able to locate me on the map. Thank you for this app!! | Awesome app, clearly was a great guide to us for being here as first time visitors, I strongly recommend for all who plan to visit Paris , this app was a good guide in pointing out the key popular sites, that you have to see in Paris 
We also learn to move on Metro, train  and bus. To the different cafes,  restaurants | The map feature was awesome! | My whole week in Paris depends on it! | Above | User Friendky Detailed , Easy , Accurate. | This app is going to save my time in my next trips. I’m preparing my route and planning every day to use when I’m there. Thank you! | Outstanding resource as we navigated Paris without data. | We used this app CONSTANTLY to find all the sites, shops, record stores and parks we wanted to see. Very easy to use and no bugs found yet! AAA+ | The app really helped me find my way around. | Best App for travel. I’m able to navigate to wherever I want to go and don’t have to use my expensive data plan. | Great app | I relied on this during my trip to Paris and it helped me to successfully navigate the city.  Thanks! | Great | This is an easy to use app that works well. Definitely top notch. | Helps locate and highlight all the places we want to see! | Loved the app!!! It was so easy to use. While in Paris it worked amazing!! We were able to find our way around Paris with no trouble at all!!! | Very helpful for getting around Paris | I live the Maps2Go App for offline use and the good source of hotels and restaurants.  It would be better if you could add a search feature using the Map instead of just getting a list. | Thanks for the great map! | I loved this app for years. It has all of Paris, not just the tourist parts. But somewhere in the last update, it seems to have added pop up ads, even though it’s an app I bought. My phone screen is small as it is, and I’m very disappointed the ads are now permanently on the map. | Back in the day, you carried a little red map book to get around Paris. Now, you just whip out this app and you’re unlost. Nostalgia is good, but knowing where you’re going is better. | Uses are many and it’s free. Maps,subway map. Prior version seemed easier to search places and addresses but it’s my go to downloadable map with flagged locals I choose before traveling. | Download to be used offline and never get lost.   Nice to have the metro included. | Ease of use ! | Easy to use & addictive in a good way | Had a wonderful experience and terrific food. Nice and great service. | Love this app | I travel with a smartphone and an iPad. When I have network connection, it is very useful to have a precise map already loaded. | I do t know his we could have got through Paris without this app!!!  Both in planning before hand and finding and going while in Paris, this app was essential to finding and learning about the many wonderful things Paris has to offer. | If you don't pay don't bother | This app consistently fails to download offlline content. So the number one reason you would want to use this app is also the number one reason it doesn't work. It's a good start but that needs to be fixed. | Paris, FR used for anniversary trip in June 2017. Very helpful for locating streets as we moved about in Paris for 2 weeks. | Used this app in Paris, it worked very good offline what helped me to find my location in the city easily. I like the option that I could find any sightsee being offline :) thanks | This app gives you the ability to locate where you are and where you need to go with a simple touch of the finger. It also tells you where the Metro is located and what cafes and restaurants and monuments are nearby. Indispensable! | If you are going to visit Paris (and surrounding areas) then you need this app! 
So basically, you get a map that looks a lot like Google Maps. It's complete with locations, road names, and even the entire metro system which was extremely useful for me! 
You are also able to create a ""list"" of restaurants, attractions, custom locations, etc, and save it all so that you know exactly where you're going in advanced. 
My ONLY problem with this app is that it won't show you turn by turn directions which shouldn't be an issue if you're good with directions.
It also gives you recommendations of places to check out based on categories you can choose from like night clubs, shopping, the best food, and stuff like that. 
All in all, I heavily relied on this app during my week in Paris (It was literally my bible) and I couldn't have been happier with how it turned out. It didn't drain my battery either! Thank you to the creators, I truly love this app. 

PS: if you ever get lost, your smart phone should still show your gps location on the maps app even without service. It should be easy to use this app once you find yourself. 
Also, the metros will take you to almost every landmark in Paris with minimal walking so I'd invest in a ""carnet"" of 10 tickets at the metro. | Super nice I can plan my future trip to Paris. It’s super cool that you can make lists and notes I really like it.
 All of this app is free and it shows what the price is for Hotels in Paris 
I recommend this app if you want to go to Paris someday. | Going to apple or google maps part needs to be online. If you use the show map, gps works to show your current position and help get to your destination. | We downloaded everything ahead of time and I was able to tour around Paris without WiFi. I wish every major city has such a tool. | Excellent Paris app tres non | I have used it several times on trips to Paris and it works like a charm!  Map and destinations all in the same place!  5 stars.  It would great to have more colors than are presently available for destinations in the lists. | This made my trip to Paris way easier to navigate.",4.70468,342,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/20/db/3d/20db3d72-2d2d-b935-5582-78fca14c4fcd/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ed/4c/4d/ed4c4dee-222c-ff41-3c26-95083d37c8e2/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/5e/1e/1d/5e1e1db8-98ae-da47-c624-37690d343edf/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/06/7f/d8/067fd88d-bb57-7479-44f3-f1d45088671a/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/80/76/71/80767150-7a66-b2f8-2e6c-2f4da7295996/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/0d/9b/bf/0d9bbf8e-e287-8e86-5c39-c3c4620155af/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/4d/31/8d/4d318d19-d737-dcdd-7fbf-d302fafbe417/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/5f/a6/ad/5fa6ade9-2958-27b9-d265-beebda9dae58/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/cf/d1/63/cfd163d9-5cb1-f8d1-db62-6be665ead134/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/b9/36/c6/b936c691-bd67-78a4-f478-35cea16f963b/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

It does a lot of things right, and I especially like its ability to collect brainstorming ideas and then add them to a final itinerary. 

The interface is a bit cluttered and confusing, however, and the app doesn’t quite handle all the fundamentals as well as some competitors. The app has also crashed on me several times, and produces audio feedback for every button click, which can’t be turned off and quickly becomes annoying. The web interface is better than the app in almost every way. | Used this to plan our trip, super helpful specially if you are going to a lot of places you’re not familiar with.  It helps you group them together. | If you have used google map trip planning feature, this is the plus version of it! 
Easy to use and digest travel info, and they are always rolling out new features! | There was a major glitch that occurred on the app causing me to be unable to use it for the first day of my roadtrip I had planned (and paid for). Nan was very helpful in making sure the problem was resolved in a timely, professional manner. The glitch did screw up the first day of my trip, but now that it’s fixed, the app works perfectly and I am happy to continue to use it! | Pebblar is a great no-frills app for travel planning. It calculates mileage between stops, lets you pick your method of travel, input hotels, dining, and points of interest from a database (and I didn’t run across anything that WASN’T in the database). Has a great expenses breakdown chart feature. You can download all your trip data in case you lose mobile service while on your trip. And you can purchase a one-time trip so you don’t have to pay for an expensive yearly subscription like with other travel apps — this is great if you only travel once a year like I do. There is also a companion web app. My favorite feature on the web app is the “print” function, which sounds odd, but it spits out a PDF containing everything under the sun! Maps, daily routes, daily lists, overall itineraries… so great. Developer is extremely responsive to questions and feedback. I’m very glad I found this app for planning my summer road trip. | The app loads to a screen that tells me there are two kinds of tabs in the app. I cannot click out of this screen and get to the app itself. This is literally all it is. | So the concept is great but the app itself is kinda buggy. The UI has panels with instructions that don’t go away. I’ve been using it to plan a 10 Roadtrip. It would be nice if it functioned more like a regular calendar with the map on a separate panel like it set out to do. Also on the computer you can reorder the route much easier. | They’ve thought of almost everything! I just started using it for a weekend birthday trip coming up and am looking forward to using it for my upcoming 22 day trip to London and Paris. Absolutely love the expense tracking, check lists, and document uploading. Is there a notebook or journal area so you can write about the fun things you did or take notes, or is that just in the reservation/note section of each event? | This app and the desktop version are awesome overall however a few things could be majorly improved. On the desktop app, there is no option to sort your big list of activities that show up on the left side of the screen for each city. It would be nice if you could sort by date, or type of activity (I.e food vs attraction). It would also be nice if there were more options to filter the map, again based on type of activity, I.e. all the restaurants saved. You can assign color labels but there’s nothing then that you can do interactively with these labels other than see them pop up on your map. It’s also not easy to shuffle around your itinerary, I.e. if I want to move all my June 4th activities to June 5th, I have to individually click a new date for each activity on the left side panel, which is especially difficult because, again, you cannot sort this panel by date. 

Still overall highly recommend but needs lots of improvement! | It’s written towards the end of the description that it needs subscription. I downloaded and started editing my trip. The interface is good, looks modern and simplistic. Too bad I can’t use any of it unless I pay money. Though it’s not entirely developers fault, wish Apple marked Apps that require subscription separately. | As I was trying to plan a trip I noticed that it wasn’t letting me add more cities to my trip (I’ve only have added two so far). | I have planned my last two international trips using Pebblar and have been thoroughly impressed. I will never plan another trip without Pebblar and will certainly never go back to using Google map stars again! The app is under continuous improvements and the dev team were super helpful to get me back on the go. The option to collaborate is another great feature to help plan your next trip with coworkers and friends alike.

I do a lot of travelling for work and this helps keep it interesting when I have to go to new locations. I'm also pretty excited about all the guides being free now as well. | The concept is great for this app but it’s super buggy. You can work around a few of the bugs but not all. I will continue using it and hopefully it will get some updates. | the app gives nothing worth the initial price, and then asks money for spots in national parks available for no fee.  save your money, don’t feed scoundrels, they breed flies and other pests like themselves. | Love ForoSpot! None of the lame drama of social media sites and tons of great sites I’d never have discovered without it.  Highly recommended! | I just found this app. We are more than half way through our road trip. I found some amazing spots in towns like St Charles MO. And fascinating abandoned buildings. Throughout Kansas. I wish I could alert more people. And I wish this app would let me add a spot. If I can add one I haven’t figured that out. | This app is absolutely phenomenal! After retirement, I spend a lot of time doing road, trips and photography. This app has everything you need to help you see the United States, and all the great things that are there! | I have been using FotoSpot for awhile and I am pleased to report that I have no intention of discontinuing its use or reverting to using travel books and magazines. FotoSpot has explored thousands of tourist attractions in all 50 States, including locations such as the “The Cursed Stone Couch” in Pennsylvania (where I live), which I had never heard of, but I found extremely interesting. Wherever you may be, you can check for attractions that are close by simply tapping the “Nearby” button in the app or, if you prefer, tapping on the map icon for a view of your location where you can zoom in and choose “show Fotospots in this area.” Clicking on any visible mini-camera will tell you where it’s located. Clicking again will display a picture of the attraction and a detailed explanation. While on the screen, you have the option to save that location for later or, if you’re already there, add a photo for other users to view. On this screen, you can click on the “Been Here” button or the ”Check-In” feature, which will gain you points. Did I forget to mention points? With the points you collect from visiting sites, you can trade in for FotoSpot “swag.” Now that is cool - an app that gives back! | I’m here in CT exploring the state and there are so many amazing waterfalls that are missing from here. I wish there was a way to submit locations. | Makes the long boring road trips a little more interesting! | I like how this app is almost a no-brained—it simply uses your location to pinpoint nearby landmarks. You can tap each Fotospot that comes shows up on the map, and decide which ones are worth your time. It’s also interactive; it gives you that social media feel because you can submit your own photos to help fellow travelers out. | As a travel novice, I tend to rely on other travelers to know where to go. This app is made for me to not just post my experiences and photos but guide my path through others. Great job! | As a photography enthusiast, I’m always looking for new places off the beaten path to go visit and snap photos. This app is extremely useful for that and saves me a lot of time narrowing down where my next adventure will be. | I absolutely love this app! I’m obsessed with it. Who knew there were so many cool places around me? I can’t wait to log more!!! | Very nice 👍 | You had me at larger-than-life, novelty-sized Muffler men! This has been a gem as I explore the country - so many cool, off-the-beaten-path attractions. | Wish this app was available for other phones not just iPhones. I was telling friends of mine about it and they can’t download the app. 

Other than that I love it! | All I can do is move around a map. Can you add a text search option? | Explore and get some air!
Don’t stay locked up wearing a mask!
Get some fresh air and sunlight! | Urban explorer here and I have used Fotospot constantly for the last year or so and I am never disappointed. I love finding stuff off the beaten path or abandoned and I appreciate all of the people who make Fotospot what it is! You guys are the best. 

Check us out! @urbanexplorersusa | Using an iPhone app on an iPad sometimes works but in this case it is disappointing. | It popped up saying “Enable location” I hit okay and it won’t do anything so I can’t even get into the app. I tried to re-download it & everything but it still won’t work. I keep hitting the button and nothing changes. | I travel all over the country for work, and have been doing so for many years. I thought I knew all of the cool and quirky things to see in most cities, until I found this app. Not only can you find unique spots to check out, but you can earn points when checking in or uploading a picture. You can redeem the points for some pretty cool, comfortable, and unique shirts….and a hat with the company logo on it is also an option. Another cool feature is the content can be provided by the community/users of the app. I really enjoy being able to contribute to such a fun platform.  Keep up the good work Fotospot! | Some very interesting places. Get out & see Texas. No other place like it. | This sight is really good place to find unusual out of the way spots to visit! | The app can’t even be used unless you turn your location on.  It should be allowed to search places without having to turn on my location | Wish I could add places. | I’ve tried all three methods of registering for an account multiple times and it keeps giving me an error that I need to try again later. Very frustrating and needs to be fixed. | I just got it . So far I like it. I have a ton of pictures I would like to post but I am not at the location. I like posting after I leave a location,  for safety reasons. I wish that was an option with this app, or maybe I haven’t learned it yet. | I just switched from iOS to android and I just figured it out that this app is not available on Google store. 
I really loved this app. | This app allows you to find interesting (and many time odd!), beautiful, fun and unique destinations all over the country! You get to collect points for free Merch (very cool stuff) and compete against friends. I travel a lot for work and it makes going to new places fun! I highly recommend this app! I have been to 47 states but now have to revisit them all to see the “Fotospots”!!!! | I was looking for cool local things to do and this app has it all!!! Great pictures, directions and historic value given also

Will even use in my own city | If you value your privacy, don’t use this app!  I found my photography posted on the app’s Facebook page.  So, they are monitoring your input & taking what they want.  As soon as it was posted, I found that I was suddenly being followed by someone that I have no desire to know.  Your privacy goes out the window with this developer.  Be careful. | Where has this been all my life? If you need help figuring out what to do this weekend, or want to explore spots that really express a city or state’s unique character, look no further. | As a dad, it helps to have this guide to some fun locations no matter where we are at to explore with the kids. We’ve already shot some really cool photos 👍🏼 | Hi I love this app! Especially because I’m from Sf and everyone always asks me where to go take photos! How can I add a tourist spot that’s not shown? Is it possible! Anyways great job guys! I will share with everyone I know! 👊🏽👍😎 | Pretty cool App I love you so much | i was so excited for this app i was gonna start saving all these cute ventures right away !! then i went to hit the save button the app requests i make an account, then when i try to adjust the age no numbers pop up or months leaving me at ten years old and unable to use the app because you have to be thirteen. i would love to be able to put my correct age into the thing so i can use the app but it won’t allow for it !! | Just downloaded this app and it isn’t letting me confirm my age. I get to the profile section and fill out my name and email, right when I try to confirm age, it won’t let me add my bday. The months and dates are not appearing on the scroll as well as the year. Deleted the app and tried again. Same thing. Bummer. I wanted to try the app out. | Much potential here but they need to do a lot more to make this app more than what it is. 

1st - needs way more spots listed, it is fine to get user added spots but the developers need to go into certain areas and add more popular spots. There is no reason for some of these major hot spots and destinations like the outerbanks to have one or two items, developers, do the work and add spots. And you need to make it much easier to find and add a spot for the user added spots. Very convoluted. Give users bonus points for adding spots and you might get more people doing it. 

2nd - not enough participants on this ap to show more photos and give feedback. Most spots only have one photo. And just not enough spots or incentives to make people use the app. 

3rd - make an option to select multiple photos at a time and choose photo albums from your phone. The ap is very slow and I don’t want to add one at a time. This makes people less likely to bother adding more or any at all. 

4th - let people leave reviews/feedback about the location/site or star value rating on if worth visiting or not. | I really like the idea of this app. I think it’s cool that it lets you know hidden gems that are near you. A big problem I have with it is when you try to check in. You can be at a location and it constantly says you aren’t close enough. I think you need to broaden the check in to at least 5 miles around the cite. A lot of the cites don’t have great reception so you should be able to check in when you can. There is no benefit in lying so it would just be nice to still be able to post it. I tried to add a site but it didn’t end up letting me put the state and it didn’t save. So that seemed like a glitch too. | that app is so awesome!!! not only is it addicting due to the points system they implemented, it is also so cool to see what is “tour worthy” around you. I accidentally spent the whole day driving to new places, hiking, taking photos, and exploring my state. I highly recommend !! I am excited for my new road trip, so I can show off this app to my friends. | I live in Los Angeles and love exploring all these unique attractions. I think the heart stairs are my favorite. This app rocks!  \m/ (> <) \m/ | So may cool spots to explore! | Fun fun fun !!!!! | I love love love this app! It’s my go to app when I’m going on a road trip and when I’m just traveling to a new city! There’s so many places around me that I had no clue existed! Love that you can check in and save places as favorites! Such an amazing app! | Can’t get passed location sharing page. I click ok and it just sits there. Want to use. | You guys are so close to having a near perfect app. So many people are giving you the answer on how to fix it too. NOT being able to look around and view spots separate from your current location is a huge miss. When people travel, they want to plan ahead. It’s so simple! Additionally, international locations outside of the US would be amazing too. | Downloaded this app after seeing its ad on instagram. It is cool that I can see photo worthy spots nearby where I am. However, I want to see other cities as well for planning my future trips. Main list view is always set to my current location - I cannot change it to somewhere else. I am able to manually change to another city with the map view, but every time I click on a photo worth spot then go to prior screen hoping to see other spots, it resets my map view back to my current location.

Hopefully the developer can make an update to this app. Or if I am using incorrectly and there is this function already, please advise. Thanks! | Love this app so far but there are lots of errors.  Places misnamed,  wrong locations of supposed photo.  Within a 10 mile radius of where I live there are at least 5 errors.

GPS works very well offline and you can access information on places and sites as you go- just like a mini travel guide | I originally gave this a 5 star review but am demoting it to one star. It worked perfectly and as expected for a day then erased half of my stars on the map even though they were still saved in my favorite places. Locations were also inaccurate. I realized I could download google maps, so for the remainder of my trip I used that. | I always use Ulmon when going to new cities because everything is there at your fingertips. Madrid is no exception. Only thing missing is a metro map.... | Nothing better to get information about places, maps, restaurants and atractions | And I love this guide. It helps me find different places so get to know the city better. | great | Go and download this app. You won't regret it! | Go-to map for Madrid! This my guide for getting everywhere in the twisty grid that's called Madrid. A wonderful offline guide. 100 stars! | When traveling first thing I look for is if this app has a map for the city or place am going to. And so far it always has the map and offline and integrated with the GPS. 
The bonus - list of museum, restaurants, tourist spots, etc | Loved using this app during my trip to Rome. Found it helpful and very user friendly. Experience was so good I now look out for other Ulmon city travel guides whenever I travel! | Excelente aplicación de mapas sin tener que estar conectado a Internet, permite acceder a él y más aún ver en qué lugar de esta sin tener que ocupar la conexión a internet, triangula con antenas de celulares y no se utiliza el roaming. | This map has been so incredibly helpful during my vacation. I can't believe how useful it is throughout the day, yet uses NO DATA, because it works through gps to track your location. Awesome app!! | Usually don't rate apps but after a trip to Europe using this offline maps, I can asure you, this app will make your trip easier and you won't miss any important spot in the city. I used London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Rome, Florence, Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon! In Budapest I felt lost because they don't have a map for this city but Google also doesn't have a map for Budapest offline. 
I'll put 6 stars but I can't so 5 it's the closest. One more thing, all this is for FREE! And this is not all, also you can download the information about the historic places in the city and then you can get the info offline. 
You have to try it!! | Great app, very helpfull | Excellent app for exploring Madrid - offline!  Full of great suggestions and site information!  GPS capability prevented me from going down the wrong road many times!  No option to select your walking path, which would have made this app even better!! | I visited Madrid and this map came very handy on several occasions. I was able to look up places even when I was off the network since it gave me the option of downloading points of interest when I first opened the app. | I went for a 16 day Europe trip and this maps literally saved my vacation experience. I highly recommend this maps! Be aware that sometimes you have to use common sense by searching for the Metro Stations. Enjoy! Highly recommended! | I love this app. I am able to imput different markers for places that are of interest to me, once I select the location I can later refer to it, which is better than having a paper map. | Traveling around for a few days in Madrid the offline map worked great using GPS and saving on 3G/LTE connection fees. Roads, names, and sites were very accurate.  Some restaurants changed, etc... But all maps have those issues. | Works OK. Very useful cause u don't need internet | This is our first time here and it has been a big help. We have wifi at the hotel but no data plan. We research, make a to-do list and pin the places on the map, and our day goes smoother. :) Wishlist: make metro stops more visible on map.",4.77778,36,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/4b/18/b8/4b18b844-4615-2445-8f52-08ff1249ae5d/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/85/1a/d5/851ad58a-c070-84c5-577d-6f231ff25d76/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/23/c3/4a/23c34a77-851b-46e1-0597-5ebad8102b91/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/cc/83/7a/cc837aa7-7cdb-c38c-ebfd-52e0a75918a4/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/67/fc/f7/67fcf733-72cc-4872-4f42-3ff8358a7954/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/b6/12/a4/b612a4d4-e51b-06af-152a-afe4bd6c6ed9/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/56/c9/16/56c916ca-8e7e-c8ab-8f33-b5dee21fec0d/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/c8/cb/76/c8cb7688-2d28-280b-7bec-04c08cc3f3cc/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/95/cd/6e/95cd6ea8-0bad-4f37-d7e3-0b9a0384a714/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/67/bb/a2/67bba2e4-fb42-af90-0034-1c5a3414397b/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The one star is as low as I could go on the fly. | I have been using this application for a few years now I have traveled several places in Europe I’ve been to Jordan, Israel and cities in the United States and it is always accurate and easy to navigate. The zoom capability is second to none. It appears to use cell tower to accurately pinpoint your position and thus there is no need for internet or live data, but it works with it as well.  
Love this app!!!!!!!! | I have used this app and recommended to others to use while traveling in unfamiliar Countries. Your own personal Guide! | Very useful | Excellent way to research your trip and get ideas on what to see , visit and where to eat | My wife and I are planning a trip to Lisbon and love this app. I like the ability to write notes for each attraction, restaurant, etc. this way we can store what other peoples liked and disliked then use it for our own good | Easy and simple. Informative | Love the offline map. | I always use Ulmon maps when planning and visiting cities in Europe. They are the best! | Very helpful - save all the places you want to go and navigate without needing to buy data. Only suggestion is I wish it also pulled in info from Yelp. | This free app has been awesome. When I have wifi, I research places I want to go in Lisbon and drop stars on them. Then I use the map offline to get there - or when we're wandering a new area, I check it to see if any of my wish list places are close by. Strongly recommend! | Having been using since 2014 and it's accuracy has not failed in settings as diverse as Quito, Ecuador to Lisbon to Madrid to San Francisco and New York City.  Do not travel without it. | Excelent, mainly because to have the map offline is a lifesaver. My only regret is that you can't trace a route between two points, for instance, from my hotel to The Tower of Belem in Lisbon. | Works offline so you can search locations anywhere. I used this exclusively while touring Lisbon, Belem, and Sintra. Forget the paper tourist maps, this is all you need. | This is not the app for people who want to know what to see. It's for people who want to know what's near them. 
If you want an app with a list of museums or other sights, you can do much better. | I have used Ulmon apps for a few years now and I have found them to be very comprehensive. | Más que recomendable para los viajeros. | Usually don't rate apps but after a trip to Europe using this offline maps, I can asure you, this app will make your trip easier and you won't miss any important spot in the city. I used London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Rome, Florence, Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon!

You have to try it!! | What I was looking for was a map that shows both my current position (using GPS) as well as the locations of all the attractions I selected, so I could figure out the best path to see them all.  The fact that it can do this offline is a big plus, so I won't be gobbling up my precious data usage when I'm in Europe. | This App was a game changer for me in Lisbon. It can be used without any wifi access and shows your current position. It works so well is bulletproof. It is way better than having a paper map of the streets. Every city should have this App!!! | Visiting a city where you don't have internet access? With this app you will not get lost, without having to flash those old fashioned paper maps that advertise your status as clueless tourist... I'm impressed by the level of detail and the search function. Incredibly useful. | Great app, you don't even need cellular data | I could not enjoy Lisbon as much as I did without this app. | Very useful when traveling without data on your phone bc of the ability to use it offline | I will be traveling to Lisbon Portugal and this is just what needed. | Nice app, nice price; but crashing during use on iPhone 5s and iPad mini (map is ok, tapping a hostel or a bar ok, tapping for a detail - and crash). :( It is an alpha version, you can not use it while walking in the city.",4.7931,29,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/c4/b1/dd/c4b1ddbc-e425-8c4f-0ffe-af986247704a/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/42/97/e6/4297e61b-c7bc-3ff8-27f1-c04524a1c331/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/fc/6c/83/fc6c8314-cf47-03d4-9b5e-e3ea2d5d776e/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/e6/10/b2/e610b218-7e13-b4b3-e82d-33a6bf51d50d/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/fd/0a/61/fd0a61d5-1921-1567-42e3-43ab8bb231bf/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/34/25/9d/34259d26-2cff-9c03-f990-bc153c6857a5/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/f9/22/99/f922997d-bfb3-160f-3fff-3b33041fdf26/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/7d/39/59/7d395963-a801-501c-b94a-a178ac508b92/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/48/ee/aa/48eeaa60-5326-d064-8b8c-15eee6177177/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/7a/6e/24/7a6e2408-515d-70f9-41ce-833ffa6ac28b/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

She drove 15 minutes out of the way- which shouldn’t have been out of the way but Lyft misread the directions. She could have dropped us off in a random field 15 min from our house but she did the right thing and brought us to the right place, even though Lyft wasn’t compensating for that. Absolutely ridiculous and if I was alone as a female would have been terrified. But Chrystal was amazing and deserves far more than what she’s getting from you. | Sometimes the app found a close drive but it’s change for another driver so far. This services every day is worst and so expensive | Great conversationalist, clean car, great driver, all around a five star experience…thanks Launa!

Bikram
Aka Bik | I would rate 0 stars if possible. My ride was canceled several times and no one came. Took a taxi instead, this service is absolutely useless unless you pay extra for an upgraded version. Will never use again. | I specifically picked the wait and save because it said 10-25 min pick up time. I was having a drink w a friend and my ride was there 2 mins after I ordered it. Mohammad was great. Don’t do a wait and save though if the time frame doesn’t match up. | Taroy is awesome!  He allowed us to stop at WaWa to pick up some groceries on our way in.  Greatly appreciated! | Cheryl picked us up after our dinner cruise. We are three ladies, including me, in Charleston for the first time on vacation. The car was spotless, Cheryl was friendly, and we had a very nice conversation from the dock to our hotel.  Also, Cheryl’s GPS was sending her the wrong, maybe the long way. She realized this right away, and knew exactly where she was going to bring us directly back to our hotel. We have been here for 4 days and have walked everywhere so we also knew that Cheryl took the shortest route. Great job. | Very nice guy!!! | THE most personable, thoughtful, and competent ride I have had with Lyft. I thoroughly enjoyed the 30 minute ride, surrounded by idiotic Florida drivers to whom Curtis bore no commonality save holding a steering wheel. | beautiful | Great driver and a great person! | Pay more to wait longer? Pay three times more to schedule?! Lyft is a dishonest company! Dropping them and deleted the account. They should go out of business. | GREAT CONVERSATION & VIBE | Professional curiosity respectful safe travel
RM | Driver never came. Still got charged. Lyft “customer service” will gaslight you and say you got a ride because we charged your card. Yeah, it doesn’t make sense. | Grateful for Lyft | Nice clean car | 98% of the time their arrival time is a flat out lie. It’s always double. I never have the problem with Uber. | I’m up and surprised at my total for a ride is more than what I sign up for. That’s the only reason for the lower rating. Aside from that they do a great job and the drivers are excellent. | The lift system kind of jerked me around a little bit. One driver seem to be going around in circles and rerouting and eventually I got the second driver who patiently waited for me while I found him. Good system, but it was a little tense finding the car that had come for me. Still I highly recommend Lyft. | Prices are observed there’s no way I should have to pay $20 for a 3 mile trip | Allen was awesome, new to Lyft, carry himself like he been with ya’ll for years. Give him a bonus. | In short, this is the worst of the scooter service companies. Their “no go” zones are far larger. than other scooter services, and they are much more strict about imposing “incorrect parking” fines. I’ll never be taking a Lyft scooter again. Thanks. | Treats drivers bad they are underpaid and it shows  Uber is almost always cheaper. The thing about this app is that it never knows my location even tho it’s turned on. Im tired of this. Very expensive and not worth it. If I could I wouldn’t use this app. Use Uber | While others were fretting about the transfer to the Airport, I was able to get a Lyft ride with a 10 minute wait at a better price than the sponsored bus and with personal service. Why go anywhere else? | Absolutely love Derek !! I was so anxious and he helped calm me down! AND I LEFT MY PHONE IN HIS CAR! He came back to give it to me! Definitely recommend Derek!! | Clean car, good driver | After much digging, you can find a place on the app to add other people as folks you can book the car for. Unfortunately, the instructions on how to book a car for somebody other than yourself are wrong, and so you can’t do this after all. | The ride was easy to schedule and got there so fast it was amazing | Very nice driver clean car and very family oriented | I would like to have this driver again for May 1 appointment that I have for national Spain Center Pain Center, Nico for 9 o’clock in the morning thank you very much | I deleted the app temporarily. When I reinstalled it, my money was gone. Lyft, why is my balance $0? | Super… quick, nice, clean | I find  it pretty easy to use | Very attentive and accommodating! | Fast, Considerate, and Safe. Thanks, I would recommend without a doubt. | This app stole money from me and refuses to pay it back. You all are crooks who steal from people! | Lyft’s whole policy of “book a ride then call the driver to see if they can take your pet to the Emergency Vet… then wait around messaging driver after driver until you find someone who will respond AND come” would be laughable… if it wasn’t so darn dangerous for all the pets waiting around for a ride to get life saving care.

Just add an option when searching for a ride that asks for pet info (dog/cat, weight/size, carrier/leash, etc etc) first THEN matches you with a driver who is pet friendly. Stop gambling with pets lives. | Great driver | I’m so incredibly disappointed by Lyft. I use ride sharing almost every day and twice today, going to and leaving the airport, they dropped my ride and lied about the time. The first time the driver was all of a sudden driving the wrong direction and I had to cancel it. Almost missed my flight. The second time someone picked it up and it said one minute away, but he was still dropping someone off, then he canceled me. If Lyft can’t make this right I’m going to delete the app and tell everybody in my company not to use them. | The ride couldn’t have been better in spite of heavy traffic. The driver was perfect. The car was clean. He arrived right on time.. | It’s a bait and switch. Should be illegal. Offered pricing but then never got a driver .. waited over 30 minutes then finally booked Uber. If you want an actual ride I would never use Lyft. | This app has been defunct for two weeks that I know of. It will not load the ride  options Apple xr | It is getting worse and more unsafe every single day. 

1-Many many drivers who are different from the person who is actually registered with the company. What is the point of background check? And who is responsible if sth. happens? 
Some don’t even speak English not even a word. They can’t even say“I don’t understand English „ I don’t believe they would get the job if they can’t communicate with ppl who are taking the ride. Sometimes things can happen and we need to communicate. 

-The guidelines are so simple in the company that drivers allow themselves to give rides with a TOTALLY different car that is not even registered and then asking if I was scared to get into the car!!!this is the last ride I am taking with lyft. If the company was strict enough no one would allow him/herself to do that.

-Lying about waiting time.

-I will delete the app today because it is not my job to waste my time after every single ride to let the company know there was a safety issue. It is the company’s job to have strict rules when it comes to other people‘s safety and life. | Great ride! | I meet awesome people on this app | Lyft map routing seems to always find the worst route to get me somewhere on time. My Drivers who use Google maps or Tesla maps instead of the Lyft maps consistently get me to my destination in the time it takes if I drive it myself. If they try to follow Lyft maps, we get stuck in avoidable traffic or poor routing through roads with frequent stoplights instead of highways and interstates. For goodness sake, just use Google map data or Waze or something. | Jane is very kind.  Came as fast as she could in spite of traffic. I felt very safe.  I am very pleased and thankful. | Driver was very patient and helpful.  Best Uber driver. Thanks again. | Drivers always go to the back which is no longer a through street.

Note that it’s not perfect—best to verify info—but it’s pretty darn good at locating campgrounds and providing relevant info, ratings & photos. | AllStays is my GoTo site for all of my trip planning.  I read the reviews and star ratings as well as the pictures of the campground. | When traveling and we want to make an unplanned stop or find a new location this has been the one app we always go to. It is such an easy approach to use and the reviews are always accurate. This has kept us out of some pretty sketchy places. Totally worth the money. | I only use it on the iPhone and iPad. Please, I don’t want to extend it to the web (“Pro”). Please consider nagging me about it a little less frequently on my iOS devices. | This is the best phone app ever created and is the only one I’ve ever paid for! Up-to-date information on RV parks, reviews, address, phone numbers, amenities like LP on site and cabins. It’s great! Sadly, the $9.99 I paid fifteen years ago doesn’t cut it anymore and it’s now a yearly subscription. Well, I gave it some thought and I’m in. Well worth it. | Love this app it has almost everything you need. The only thing that would make it greater is if you could “save your favorite” campgrounds. Getting a little pricey. | We’ve been traveling around the U.S. since retiring in 2016 and this app is my “go to” for finding the places suited to our camp style. It’s the best and hasn’t let us down. Makes trip planning a breeze! Thanks | Easy to use across the USA. | We down loaded this  app in 2015  it’s outstanding  we use it every time we travel it gives you all the information you need for anything you’re looking  for. | I have been using the Allstays app since it first came out. It is my first go to app for. Camping. | Nothing works.  No information on sites given. Things written on site are so small, a magnifying glass is needed. Do not waste your money. | I have used this app for years and love the way it allows you to sort sites by type.  So if I want a State Park, just apply the filter and it will show those to you on the map.  Very convenient and find it to be accurate. | While I like the app, I was supposed to be grandfathered in for the free app and $20 is a little steep. As soon as I figure out how to cancel I will. I may have to delete the card.
I was assured that I would be grandfathered in, but I was charged. I emailed them and never heard anything. I hope to hear from the app and have the charge taken off my account. | Heard from others this app can help you locate other services on the road. As soon as you create your account every interact on the app leads you up start up your subscription. I don't appreciate those pay tactics so can't do anything meaningful without paying. They increased the free trial from 3 to 7 days but if you don't cancel they'll auto renew for the year. Classy.... No thanks and can't recommend, deleted. | Nearly every button of the free version just tries to get you to buy the paid version. You literally can’t even get a feel for if the app would be useful without signing up for their 3-day free trial then paying $35 annually. It looks like it might be a good app but I’m not going to support marketing this aggressive, it’s ridiculous. | We’ve been using AllStays since 2012 (I think), and have used it exclusively, along with iOverlander (recently).  The staff at AllStays are very responsive and helpful.  Just signed up for AllStays Pro.  It’s even better. | Why don’t you ever tell you it’s $34.99 a year before they get your information out if you. Evil. | I am 68 and it may take me a few weeks to get accustomed to this app.  I really don’t know how long it will take because I have to pay money to get in to the app.  It wasn’t easy to find a phone number to call someone, but I finally found one and will call today for assistance. | Let me first say that I did love the app. however, I purchased it 2017 and I only had to pay for the app. I turned family members friends so many people onto a purchase app $10 and change. Because it was so worth it

Then they went to subscription basis and somewhere along the way I was told people who had the app before a certain day wouldn’t have to pay that subscription fee.

I have reached out by the only contact I could find email for Sam, but no response.  The common courtesy to respond to someone’s issue comment is just key. I hope you don’t have any issues with your stays because I doubt very seriously they’ll take care of them or respond to you. Other than that I do love the app and I’m sorry it’s a subscription based now for the old loyal’s  who made it what it is.  

I’m giving a one star because maybe you’ll respond! | I paid what was supposed to be a one time fee for the app. Now they have started charging annually and don’t respond to my queries. I am really annoyed by this. | Bought this app few years back after we purchased our first camper van. The most expensive app I ever bought at the time. Always thought the design was old and the interface was too busy....Haven't used it since until today when I got a notification that to take the full advantage I need to pay yearly subscription fee! 

There are so many free or low cost apps out there to choose from. | This a great app for long term planning and to discover new places | 2024- yes, still the best and most affordable trip planner and, combined with the old Streets & Trips that Microsoft abandoned, these two have been our planning guides for 14 years.
Wish it got a little more aggressive by combining its information with the actual travel planning process of miles, days, overnights, etc.  The ultimate for all of the planning apps would be to produce a calendar at the end, which is what I do with the combined information of these two, super programs. Good luck in your future upgrades to continue to be the best without becoming a slave to advertisers.

Okay, after 7 years of use, still the best-- by a long shot. If only it combined the old Streets & Trips route function and a calendar to help plan the trips, it would be phenomenal. AllStays is our all-the-time RV trip planning app. The BEST there is. Been using it for about 5 or 6years and it continues to be our main program. 6/2016 The on-line trip planners can't match the convenience because once you get off the Interstate out here in the west there is no Internet to refer back to use the on-line programs. Thank you for the automatic updates of new and revised camping spots. | Great tool for trip planning. | Was not told that there was a cost to use after 7 day free use | Unfortunately, no longer.  Almost a year ago I reported a bug - they had a link to search for reviews on the web that did not work.  The support person who replied to my email about it said they were working on as she wrote.  Many updates later it was still not working, and the basically gave the same response.  It is now “fixed” in the latest update.  What was the fix?  They deleted the feature!

The main thing I liked about the app was you could still search for campgrounds without an internet connection.  At the time I started using the app I did not have a smartphone, so often had no internet connection when not at a campground or place with public wifi.  Now that I can get internet connection virtually anywhere, the only real advantage to this app is now gone. | We’ve used pro-membership over five years for both planning and when traveling. AllStays now posts so many stores, gas stations and other businesses on their maps it’s become virtually impossible to find actual campgrounds. The filter pull-down to limit to viewing campgrounds only, does not disappear & blocks a large part of screen. It seems deliberate and given we pay for membership, seems disrespectful. Think it’s time to look at other options. | I have used this app for years and now there is a $35/year pay wall. That is outrageous for what the app provides. I will be using something else. | Love this app.  It’s the first place I check when travelling. | This is not free, except for the first week, which is very deceptive..  I am unable to delete my account without installing other software on my phone. Do not install. | Purchased pro subscription with a 20% discount offered through harvest host just to be offered a 50% discount on the app. 
Cannot sign in on app only through a website link which is not near as convenient and it appears you need to watch a number of videos to figure out how to use. 
My advice, stick to free app. | horrible way to lose what used to be loyal users. using alternate app now not this | We have tried other apps. Nothing compares to Allstays accuracy and user-friendly access to photos, reservations and information. Good job Allstays! | Says it’s free.  Makes you create a username and password.  Then tells you that you have to have a paid subscription. No thanks!!  Too many other free apps to choose from. | All this app does is save you from going to Walmart Cracker Barrel, or campground websites. All of these things show up on Google maps already. There aren’t any reviews more recent than 2021 for the areas we’ve been staying. Total scam and waste of money. | I’ve been using this app for a few years now and I still haven’t found a better RV app!  We use this one whenever traveling to get information on rest stops, overnight parking, gas stations, almost whatever we are looking for while on the road.  I haven’t really used it yet for find campgrounds or RV parks and ratings but just starting to use that functionality as well. | I travel months at a time in southwest. I really like the filter system and ability to send my choice to Maps. Works well without internet access. | I cant possibly trust this app!  After downloading it everything i touch gives me a popup forcing me to sign up and telling me its free for 7 days and $34.99 after that

But is that a monthly fee?  Annual?  One time and thats it?  How incredibly obtuse and deceitful do you want to start our relationship folks?  If you cant even be upfront with your charges 20 seconds after downloading it, im certainly not going to trust you with my payment info. Delete delete delete!  Run away from this one! | Five years back there were lots of issues - most have been resolved for my use - on the positive side the ability to search has improved greatly it’s not google level yet but who is… on the negative side the developer is again harping for the user to pay for a service that is free from google. 
Overall 
App is  user friendly, accurate, and helpful. 
A fee of $10 per year would be reasonable and in line with the services provided. | We find wonderful camping places that we would not have found without Allstays. Great info on places and easy to use. Thank you Allstays. | S | We’ve used Allstays since 2018 and have found it to be the best help in picking a place to camp and help us route safely through unknown places. | My sister recommended this app when we bought our truck camper over a year ago.  We use Allstays to find campsites, dump stations, gas, and rest areas.  They even show disbursed camp sites!  It’s so easy to use and provides quick connections to state and federal reservation websites.  Definitely worth the annual subscription fee! | If I could give this app a zero, I would. Pages are so convoluted and confusing. It’s impossible to use. No phone support. This could be the best app in the world, but impossible to get a straight answer. If they had phone support, questions could be answered in a matter of minutes. However, it takes hours if not a day for them to return an answer to an email. By then we’ve moved on. | I tried to unsubscribe. There is no place to unsubscribe. I don’t want this app. How do I get my money back? | We use this all the time for traveling and love it but, I would like an option added for 55+ campgrounds. It takes forever to find them otherwise. I also don’t like how the app automatically zooms in and out. I want to do it myself. I loose my place when I’m looking in a certain area. | They have updated this site and made it virtually impossible to still use the ‘free’ plan. Very disappointing and frustrating!! | Saw the app advertised in several platforms as a free app, but does not show anything without paying $40 to see it. Do yourself a favor and download iOverlander. | Definitely the best RV app out there. I have had it installed on all my phones since 2012 and it never disappoints. | Hard pass.

“Purchasing the tickets to Dream World, on Headout was a fantastic decision. The booking process was smooth and straightforward, and I was able to easily select the date and time that suited me and my family best. At Dream World, not only did we breeze through the crowds, but it meant we we sure of getting entry into the theme park, especially with two children - both under the age of 8 years - eager to start exploring the park without any delay or drama! Buying the Dream World Visa gave us access to (almost) all the rides so with the wrist band on us, we went straight through without having the hassle of looking for change/currency at each ride. All in all, it was a stress-free and wonderful experience!”

“Book and pay a ticket and pay in the app with just a few clicks. Tickets do not have to be printed out and can simply be shown digitally in the app. It couldn’t be easier.
Everything went well on site. Versailles was breathtaking!”

“Through a different provider, I had a trip cancelled last minute the day before and was able to book on to this tour late in the evening the day before. Tickets and confirmation of collection point were clear and the tickets are very easily available on the app. We were picked up at the pick up location on time, and our guide met us and explained what the experience would entail and the time scales. I think our guides make was Raphael, he was very knowledgeable and gave us a very detailed explanation of Krakows history as we were driving through Krakow towards Auschwitz. Showing us all the landmark buildings and their history along the way. Very easy to understand and communicated very well, and very passionate about education us all on Polish history. Very happy with this service and would recommend using them to book tours through.”

The instructions on where to redeem my tickets were wrong and I missed the window to my event. | I searched for “skip the line” tickets for Pompeii and came upon Headout. I booked and paid only to get an email telling me to expect lengthy waits to redeem my ticket voucher with no option to download the tickets themselves. The chat feature is just a bot that only responds to canned simple questions. There’s no customer service number to call. They do not reply to email. Stay far away from this useless “service”. | This app is just a google drive wrapper.  Should just be a web app. | Disastrous tour: rude guide and the attraction was closed. But will HeadOut refund us? Nope. They offered credits for future purchases. Get effed, HeadOut. | Horribly-designed app, confusing experience, doesn’t allow getting the ticket scan code without downloading the app (so you’re forced to download the app no matter what).  Bought tickets online beforehand, and still was forced to stand in the long line at the attraction to get ticket scan codes. 
Will delete this app as soon as we leave the country. | They intentionally mislead you about what tickets you’re buying and then refuse any refunds when you find out they deceived you. They’re a scalper but they make websites that make you believe they’re the official site of the attraction. Only use them if you like wasting money. | Scammers!!! Stole my money!!! Don’t buy tickets with them, they are mimicking NASA website and don’t return money back!!! | Terrible. I purchased a combo ticket for the prado museum and Royal palace on March 2024 after selecting my date and paying for the tickets the web headout send me a tickets for different dates, a month later. I contacted the web trying to get my tickets modified but they didn’t help at all. When I went to the museum and try to use the tickets the agents mentioned they often receive complaints from lots of tourist with the same issue. Headout didn’t change or modify the date or issue a refund. I had to call my credit card company for help since I had to buy new tickets | First they were not able to book the time they showed and only after we paid they came back and we had to change the time of the museum visit. Then the pdf they showed was only visible on their app and could not download so they can keep you in the app.  Lastly, after a few weeks I noticed my phone battery was strangely draining fast. This morning I looked at the % used and Headout was 59% even though I have not used it for weeks.  Clearly app has tracking me the whole time, either nefariously or they just have bad developers. Either way, deleting now and never using this service again. | They made a mistake booking my tickets that apparently are now nonrefundable and refuse to give me a refund. Never booking with them again. | This is a scam - they rip you off. | Open app, try to log in, it sends a link to your email.   Click link, that opens Safari which then opens App store which lets you re-open app, but you haven’t made any progress getting logged in.

Confirmation of ticket purchase arrives in email.  Aggregation of getting logged in repeats (even though only a minute or two has passed), as you try to get official ticket.  Finally reach a webpage (having given up on the app) that has a download link for PDF of ticket.   Hit “download” and the PDF is pulled down but not shown in Files (just in Safari recents).   When you realize that, you can show the ticket-taker, but you might have multiple PDFs to search through for the (in our case) 5 that are needed (look at the last bit of the looong file name to distinguish one from another and its duplicates). | Think twice before buying with them. They offer discounted combo packages but half of my tickets were denied entry and I had to buy new tickets at venue directly and was told there to email the company for the partial refund. The company replied quickly but the verdict was sorry the local company who sells the ticket is very strict with the refund and just denied it.. so I basically paid for the tickets twice…. | We booked tickets to Rome’s Castel Sant Angelo through what looked like an official website which never disclosed it was Headout. Then, we were never provided with the audio guide information we paid for and were treated poorly by the so called “host.”  The presentation of the website as official and the hiding of the fact that it’s a third party service seems sadly a bit common in Rome but that does not make it Ok. I won’t ever use Headout again for any services due to this misleading and ugly experience. On the plus side the visit to Castel Sant Angelo was great but it turns out we never needed anything from Headout to help us enjoy it!! | They are very bad at customer service and dont attend or give you a callback even after requesting a callback. Also the non refund policy is just simply the worst marketing strategy. I lost over 500$ because of a mistake and they dont even consider any unforeseen circumstannce as a valid reason even with genuine cases | beware when using this app, I purchased two orchestra tickets and when I got to the venue I found out they were switched for first mezzanine against my knowledge. They were not the tickets I selected when I was making my purchase and the even though I have two emails confirming I purchased orchestra seats,  they insist I purchased the seats I got with an obstructed view.  needless to say, my night was stressful and aggravating. I will never use them again. | All the tickets are x2 or x3 more expensive, and they don’t refund your money if you want to cancel you reservation. They stoled 72 euros from me and my family | I have been a avid follower and supporter of Headout and many of their outlets for several years. 

Getting the Headout Plus account has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made! 

I have been nomadic traveling the country for the last 2+ years and thanks to Headout I have wandered and explored some destinations I never would do known existed!  

Would recommend to everyone! Friends, family, and even my enemies! 😃 

Keep up the great work and superb recommendations | I need a code number from a purchase to redeem a museum ticket & I had to download a whole app just to get it…. Deleting asap. I do not have the phone storage for this. I do not have the data to waste to download this stupid app in the street. | The available Dubai offers are Good. The payment worked seamlessly and e-tickets worked well.
But the Currency conversion charges that appeared in the Credit card statement was a surprise! The discount savings that I got from the offer was significantly reduced after these charges. While booking, It was not clear what was the base currency of the site. I could have easily paid in USD with the same card and saved on the AED conversion charges. 
The site should should mention their base currency on the payment page, so customers can choose which currency they want to pay. | This app deserves all the praise! It not only helps me plan my trips efficiently but also introduces me to unique experiences I wouldn't have discovered on my own. Highly recommended for all adventurers! | Been using this app for a while now, and it continues to impress me. The detailed insights, stunning visuals, and easy-to-use interface make it the perfect travel companion. | Can't imagine traveling without this app—it's like having a personal tour guide in my pocket. The detailed recommendations and offline maps are lifesavers! | My go-to travel companion now. Packed with info, beautiful visuals, and significantly enhances my travel experience. Two thumbs up! | This app is not in anyway associated to the official ticketing sits of the museums and attractions. It just inserts itself in the search results using deceptive domain names so you will but the tickets through them and pay more. I think this is deceptive and unecessary. Stay away! | Where to begin…

Headout contacted me less than 18 hours before my scheduled tour to notify me it has been canceled. 

They provided no options for rebooking as they canceled to late, and no other options were available! 

I reached out through email, and never got a response. I waited 45 minutes for live chat, and they told me they couldn’t help, and would need me to wait for an e-mail update. I’ve spent 3+ hours of my vacation trying to get this fixed, and I paid over $100 for my tickets.

I work in support, and I can tell you this has been the absolute WORST experience with a customer support team. This is gross negligence, and it has ruined the last day of my trip to rome. 

PLEASE STAY AWAY!! THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY WITHOUT VERIFYING THE TOUR FIRST, THEN WILL CANCEL SO LATE YOU HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS. 

If I could rate this company a negative 5-stars, I would. | Do not use this 3rd party app. I purchased a ticket and it was cheaper at the door. The ticket was to climb the dome and bell tower in Florence only for the rude people at the cathedral to say it’s not good for the dome even though the ticket says both. Customer service dropped me twice and did not resolve my issue. Do your best to book DIRECTLY with the institution. Also, fees ended up costing more than just buying in person. | They sold me tickets that don’t work. When I went to the Statue Of Liberty tour check in and scanned the QR code that was given to me, I was told the tickets were for October 27th which is incorrect. So headout basically sold me old tickets!!! So a warning to those who hate scammers, DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! I wish I could give this app 0 stars but I can’t, but they deserve it. | Dream World with Headout is a fantastic experience. Their Dream World Visa streamlines entry and ride access, making it ideal for families with young children. Highly recommended for a stress-free visit. | I've used Headout for last-minute bookings, and they've always come through, making travel planning a breeze. Their user-friendly app simplifies the ticketing process, and their guides are top-notch. | Bought tickets and we’re not informed anywhere during the process that we needed to download an app in order to access tickets. Was unable to download the app at the station, missed our train, and had to rebuy new tickets. Horrible communication from top to bottom. | Bought tickets to El Prado Museum using the website, I was never able to get the audio guide authorization after downloading the app. I followed the instructions up to the “You will get an email for authorization”, never got it, tried three times and even contacted their support which was helpless. Don’t buy tckts with their audio guides | I used this app to purchase a couple experiences while in Athens.  One set of our tickets showed in a few minutes with no worries.  However, another set of tickets purchased at the same time didn’t show up until very late.  After much waiting around we ended up buying tickets at the gate to keep our schedule.  I’ve been in contact with customer support who have informed us of a no refund policy and now I am screwed out of money.  Please save yourself the trouble that many here have experienced, including myself now, and take your business elsewhere | My apple pay gets declined for no reason. | Tickets to attraction did not include entrance. We had no notice of that and missed our tour. Fifty Euro lit on fire. Do not use this company. | I purchased and received confirmation for tickets to the Louvre. Several weeks later i received a message that said the tickets were not available and the time slots they offered were one week later — after our trip. I won’t trust or do business with them in the future. | It seems like this company wants to bury the bad reviews that span over multiple years by blowing up their reviews with fake 5 star reviews. They all read like a bot wrote them. What a joke. Had wanted to use the app, but never mind. Shady. | Reliable booking apps. Useful, have been using this apps for more than 2 years. | Really straight forward, rewarded for frequent booking. Great! | Easiest platform I can use. Excellent prices I love it | Great app. Love that we can book over the app with better prices. Thank you guys. | One-stop-shop for all your travel experiences, saving you time and effort in planning your itinerary. | Their discounted offers are a lie/scam based on a super inflated price. You basically are better off buying everything separately and schedule it to your convenience, rather than buying a bulk deal that is NOT A DEAL. Cancelation and refunds are not possible.

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!! | This app allows me to do flight, hotel and cab booking from my smartphone where I want and when I want to | It has been a wonderful experience with headout so far.

There was a GOOD one. RTD got rid of that - OF COURSE. This is so confusing and jumbled up! Fuhgeddaboutit as Stephen King would say! | Doesn’t tell you what you’re doing on a close enough visual of where you are going like where you are close enough to see what you’re passing by. | Everything is is as well as expected | I wish there was something in the description that said this does not work for RTD Denver airport fares. | The smell of urine and diarrhea is often overwhelming.  You’ll get skin rashes and diseases sitting on the seats.  The air is usually filled with smoke - not just cigarette and weed smoke - hard drugs.  You’ll get an instant headache.  People shoot up in the open too.  Half the riders are free riding homeless and drug dealers and addicts.  Security doesn’t kick them off or write tickets.  Instead they hang out at stops and share drugs.

More than half the time, the train is late or canceled.  And yet sometimes it’ll leave 5 minutes earlier, leaving you hanging for the next one that may or may not show.  Rarely is it actually on the actual schedule.  Amd good luck figuring out the schedule, because the app is usually completely different than the schedule on the station signs. 

All this and bloated overstaffed and overfunded RTD get a 3% chunk of sales tax along the route, county and city taxes, plus high fares. | Network issues all the time. | Bus systems all over America had functioning gps in every bus twenty years ago. In Denver they hope the trains will know where they are by sometime in 2027.

The bus routes are so entirely inaccurate 1.5 hours to commute five miles on just the 15L is not enough extra time. Three buses in a row will simply not arrive and you will be late to work. Consistently. 

This app will only get you in trouble, which on RTD means violence. | Why would you have to pay for this?   Every other major city has apps like this for free. | Or next departures or pretty much anything. Very confusing | How can I use the app 3 times in one day and get the incorrect time every single time ?  This needs to be accurate! | What the heck?! Why are there ZERO RTD representatives here to answer questions and direct people!! I understand maintenance, I don’t understand no help!
Just another Denver failure. First a crappy airport and now this! So not good. | Most transit apps offer ways to pay, maps, etc.  Your website offers maps but not the app | Used to give real time updates and accurate schedules. Now doesn’t seem to know what’s going on and I can’t get arrival times less than 20 minutes out. Makes it pretty useless so o I’m going to remove it. | The app shows arriving, and there is even that moving bus icon. The icon indicates that this #73 bus is at the station right now, then it’s moving to the next, the next, but I was at the bus stop of like forever, but there was no bus at all.

Terrible terrible service. | As of August 2023, the app is not functioning as it should. Nothing is loading. Better off using the RTD website on mobile. | Grew up here. The app is the worst. Seriously. Awful. | ❤️it! | There is no Arabic language | Absolutely shocking how in 2023 you can’t figure out how to have a functional app for light rail. Maybe fix this? | I like this app | The walking time calculations have caused me to miss buses. | The RTD system is virtually useless - times are either incorrect or missing, updates to service changes give you an unusable link for “more information” and often times the transportation you’re waiting on just doesn’t even show up or show it’s cancelled, causing you to waste even more time waiting on the next one to (hopefully) show up. Denver needs to fix the entire transportation system, but starting with this almost useless app is a good start. At least it’s better than the other “app” that just opens a browser page for every link. | I couldn’t put in a bus route stop and get directions of how to get there. And the timing system is very confusing | This app seems to have an entirely different timetable than the RTD website. Putting in cross streets as a starting or stopping point is impossible and it leaves out bus routes that would actually make sense. | Does not list Light Rail stations clearly. Is RTD Desperate to get people to ride buses??? Yes. | Forget trying to have them “get back to you “automatic renewal IS A FREAKING SCAM. DO NOT PURCHASE. | Google is wrong half the time | App is so confusing, how the heck do you know what train is leaving?? It says track 1 but then I look at the sign at the station and both sides say track 2. I’m sitting on the wrong train that didn’t leave!!! | I have been waiting for a application like this to see in real time where the bus is located. This is similar to Double Map | i’ve tried to convince so many people to use rtd to get to the airport. it’s like a 30 min ride from union. but if you put it in this app to find the next ride, it will always say it’s an hour trip. it’s not . the end of the trip says “walk 20 min” to your destination after getting off at the airport station. if you look closely at the map, this app thinks you have to walk around the whole airport to get to the car entrance for the airport. you don’t. it’s literally 2 min from the train stop to the doors that open to the security line. no crossing roads, no sidewalks even. it basically drops you off *in* the airport. 
the airport ride is the most useful train ride we have here, make it accurate! | The app would much more helpful if it allowed bus stop numbers to be entered as favorites so you get information on buses going in the desired direction instead of a vague spot on the map that doesn’t necessarily give the desired bus information. | Worthless | Can’t display Stations. Seems like you need to know the exact name of a stop in order to plan a trip. Delete. | Good good | I have been using this app a lot recently and the past couple times I’ve been trying to go on the  1 it says it’ll be here in 9 min then I’ll wait a bit and it’ll say “57 min “ and then I have to find a new route to get home please fix this it makes everything harder it’s overall a good app but that one bug keeps making me miss a lot of important things . | 7 out of 10 times it’s wrong for whatever reason.I’m not sure if it’s the bus system or this app that’s completely useless. | I love this app | Multiple lines with same letter coming at multiple times going different directions. Not user friendly at all and I’ve traveled the world | Helpful info love how you’ve started describing and updating line issues or upcoming work, keep those updates coming cause this transport is exactly what I need! | Worthless | Always a beautiful bus ride! 😍 | Takes a long time to load and not very intuitive. Trying to find the alternate methods into downtown. App doesn’t help at all. | This app does not update Boulder rtd bus info and cancelations. Very frustrating. If fixed it is a good app. | I’m a software engineer and this is a mess. You click show me train and light rails only and it gives you the next bus route, only! Not intuitive at all and it freezes up too. 

It’s 2022 and there is excellent location technology out there, but they utilize none of it. Start tracking where your trains are and where they’re going. | Their buses in particular are more frequently late or no shows than on time. That makes using this app to plan ahead utterly useless. | What happened to just showing me train times? Why do I have to tell it the time of day I want to travel? Useless extra steps. Also live tracking? It’s 2022 and I can’t see where the train I want to ride is in real time? Not to mention being expected to pay top dollar for the privilege. | This app does not work | Unable to purchase tickets on this app. Just shows routes and times. Guess I’ll stick to the RTD app. | Because buses often arrive way too early or late, the bus arrival times aren't useful. Be prepared to wait a long time for a bus.

Our goal is to become your personal travel guide, a planner that will accompany you in all phases of your adventure.

With this planner, trips seem to organize themselves!

*Put everything you need for your trip in order:

With Passporter you can save your reservations and important documents so you always have everything you need at hand - say goodbye to the stress of not finding your boarding pass in the inbox when it's your turn at the airport!

Because nothing is more annoying than not remembering the name of that coffee shop that was recommended to you.

*Personalize your itinerary:

One of the strong points of this planner is that you can create categories to sort the places you want to visit as best suits you: by days, type of place, location on the maps... or however you want. In this way, you will create personalized and much more complete routes.

*Add reference points:

And so that you never miss any interesting place on your trips again, mark as a reference point the places you want to visit and you will always have them at hand highlighted among the others on the maps. 

*Organize your trip in a group:

Because we usually travel with more people, with this planner you can make travel easier for all your companions and yourself, inviting them to the itinerary so you can organize and plan together all the documents, places, routes, maps....

*Enjoy your planning while you are on the road:

Access your ongoing itinerary, review the day's plans and dedicate yourself to exploring and enjoying the vacation with your group of friends by carrying important documents and places to visit always at hand. With Passporter, forget about everything but enjoying the trips and the fantastic routes you've created or found, knowing that you have everything organized in the planner in your pocket.

*Share your anecdotes after the trip:

You will be able to recount your experience and share it with your friends or other travelers. To do this, create memories of the places you liked the most and come back to Passporter again and again to relive your adventures and retrace your routes through travel photos. Turn your notes into tips or travel diaries and become the envy of your friends and acquaintances!","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/0a/d8/c9/0ad8c9db-8812-93f0-40ad-7a0675ba1bd9/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-6-0-sRGB-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Entertainment""]","[""6003"",""6016""]","Travel",6003,"12+","[""CA"",""NL"",""EN"",""FR"",""DE"",""EL"",""IT"",""JA"",""KO"",""PL"",""PT"",""RU"",""ZH"",""ES"",""TR""]","111151104","16.0","2018-06-08T22:52:52Z","2024-04-24T20:01:50Z","New version with new features and improvements to plan your trips!

Tiene una cantidad de experiencias y material único y original. Es muy bueno para planificar futuros viajes. Yo personalmente la recomiendo wachitos 😉 | Cuando Jonan empezó a recomendarla no pensé que fuese a ser tan útil. No la uso tanto como me gustaría pero es genial para preparar futuros viajes, para organizar los que has hecho (mi galería es un desastre) y hasta para buscar inspiración aunque no sea para viajar.

I have been trying to get support for this, and have had no responses. Very disappointed that I will lose all of my info that I have input so far. | This is definitely a helpful app. But I must say, it crashes a lot. Which is annoying. | I use HopTail to log my travels in a coherent way and enjoy sharing them with others. I do wish that when I like someone’s trip, a tiny heart would appear on their trip in my gallery to remind me I’ve already seen it. | It’s easy to use and a lot of automatic features. However If you save most your photos in computer or google then it will be difficult because it can only upload photos from your phone. | Such a great way to plan itineraries without toggling between 15 different sets of applications. Love this! Used for our trip to portugal and will definitely use for other trips as well. | I love how easy it is to sort through my travel pictures. Features are easy to use and so so helpful! | I love hoptale! It’s so easy to share and learn from others travel suggestions! | I travel a lot and do a lot of research for my destinations to ensure I optimize my experience there, but when I look back at photos or people ask me awhile later for recommendations, it’s hard to remember.  Hoptale is the perfect travel diary for me to document my trips and memories, and also to share them with people.  It’s also great for browsing other travelers’ itineraries while trip planning!  With a slick UI it is easy to use and a must have for any explorer! | This app is very well made- it’s intuitive and easy to use. I’m so happy that I can create memories this way, as well as find other cool trips to go on in the future. | Since I love traveling and taking photos of the journey to record where I have been (from the stopovers to restaurants to BnB)
or what route I took either road trips or flights, this app is so convenient and super user friendly which I can save lots of time loading, arranging photos, in a jiffy.
Can’t be happier !!! | It’s pretty neat how easy it is to look at awesome travel itineraries. It helped me plan my trip to Olympic National Park and gave me some places I wouldn’t otherwise have known about. The pictures are beautiful which makes this much better than TripAdvisor! | Selecting the photos and jotting down some details are all you have to do. The time stamps and geo location synch really help to recreate the actual itinerary we experienced. Great way to remember and share trips and sites with others! | Love using this app to share photos from my trips and to share tips with my friends. Beautiful to look at and easy to use. Thumbs up. | Great user interface, easy to use, and best app I’ve seen to memorialize and tell a great story about travels and vacation experiences. | just to put it out there: i’m not a travel influencer. i don’t really even travel that much. i never searched for “travel journal app” on the app store. but after trying out the app at a friend’s recommendation, i realized that i never knew how much i needed this app.

i really just took it as fact that i had a bunch of unorganized travel photos on my camera roll that i’d have to scroll through the entirety of (especially after being buried in a gazillion more photos a few months after the fact) to find so i could show off my trip to others. i also found myself struggling to recount the activities that i did during the trip a year later, but i found myself being okay with just having the vague outlines of my experiences. i definitely wasn’t satisfied with this, but i was complacent.

but oh my gosh, this app really changes the way i remember my travels. like,, i can make a trip and then simply open the app and click on it later when i want to show someone how cool san francisco was? or recommend that ice cream stand in maine where i had the MOST DELICIOUS mint chocolate chip cone of my life during summer vacation, but whose name has slipped my mind? or i can just reread my journal entries from my trip to nyc to relive how amazed i was to be in the city of lights? these are all things i can do with hoptale, and i just find that so fricking cool!!

tl;dr: this app isn’t just for the travel influencers/bloggers out there; it’s really for anyone with a beating heart that even just travels once in a blue moon. | This is is so awesome.  I have been looking for a trip journal that does a bit more. Not only does it allow me to keep a detailed journal of my trip it shows me pictures, places and itinerary’s of people that have similar interests to me. Much better than trip advisor since It is very personalized and I don’t have to sort thru a bunch of useless posts. The best part of Hoptale is that it allows me to continually update my bucket list of places to visit and eat which gets longer every day:).  I can’t wait to detail my trip to Spain. | Really enjoy using this app. Slick interface, super easy and intuitive to publish albums. Going to use it to share my trips with friends! | App is very helpful for when you want to plan a trip to see what others have done.

One minor issssssssue, none of the links are working. So not so fire: more like lukewarm

Do better bro | During my trip, your tube map was so much easier to maneuver than the official underground site’s. That said, you’ve had quite a while to prepare for adding the brand new Elizabeth Line to your map. I will be back soon and I will look forward to that update, thank you! | Deleted this app before we even traveled abroad. Every time you open the app it plays an obnoxious jingle. So stupid and outdated. There is no way to disable this “feature” so it is no longer on any of our phones. | Could use this app to find travel options between places because there is no options to search destinations by names. | App sites and activities are strong suggestions organized by genre.  Super intuitive.  Spent 20 minutes selecting points on map based off my interests and geotargrted location, downloaded map to save battery and then spent the next 9 hours going from point to point!  Ez! | London is brilliant! The history and architecture far exceed my expectations! I love the trees in the city and the parks. So much to see and such variety. I adore London! | Easy to use, buy tickets and look at maps on the app! Lots of info at your fingertips but organized-not overwhelming. | Try it out | Very useful, and easy to navigate . | I found this very helpful for narrowing down the many choices available | Was quite helpful during Lumiere London to find everything. Just remember to download the points of interest ahead of time if you can as it will save your battery/data | Use the Save option for areas you're interested in. This will allow you to access maps it's the spots pinned when you're not in wifi area. Helped us get around and locate other places as well. | I'll be in London on vacation soon, and I've got quite a few good ideas for things to do from this app. I especially like the theatre map and listings feature. | Simple and easy to use. Very helpful links. I love the map because it's easy to see the restaurants and other attractions near by. I wish I could make one map for each day I am planning but I can only do one trip at a time. Overall excellent app | Looks like a lot of decent content, but won't go to landscape mode on my iPad! That's just being lazy! | This app was very helpful in deciding our daily plans when vacationing in London. Each ""tile"" showed us a possible destination and the distance from our current location. When combined with an app that gave better maps and underground information it was a good combination. You won't miss your must sees and bucket list visits with this app. | The Tower of London does not officially recognize tickets purchased through this app and is actively fighting against the app creator. They eventually did let us in though. | I'm kind of addicted to the ease of getting around that my smartphone gives me in my home country and miss it when traveling abroad. What Now gives me that functionality without needing a data plan. Amazing! | Being able to walk around sans wifi and still follow my itinerary for the day without getting lost...#winning | I wont be updating again. These last two updates each erased all my saved items, so how is that helpful? I spent a LOT of time marking and saving items for offline use and each update since my initial use has erased all that. So I DON'T plan on going thru and marking things again and I find no use in updating further. Too bad because the app is otherwise a good idea. 3 stars (or less) for app's saving of user data. | Free, useful and sleek. No complaints so far. Great job! | Best city guide ever! | I've checked out quite a few London guide apps for planning days out with my family, and this is definitely the best app I've seen. The only problem is that it crashes when certain items are selected, and that's really annoying. I hope they fix it quickly. | Crashes on ios8 | Splash screen loads then it crashes. Absolutely useless until that is fixed. | Seems like a great tool but cannot get it to open. Installed several times and just keeps crashing. | This app has no search function so you need to already know the location of your destination. It is far better for finding places of interest close by when you are walking around. Also, couldn't help but laugh at the instructions which tell you to walk and just draw a line through obstacles. Just silly. | A great app for touring London.

One particular feature I used is the ability to enter my fuel capacity and fuel usage and have the software provide me with a maximum travel point. This was extremely helpful in determining where to stop for fuel/hotels. This software only allow you to enter your fuel use not your fuel capacity- not if any value. | Great trip planning tool!

So much fun to imagine upcoming adventures! | I just paid $4.99 for a app and I can not figure it out!!!! | I bought the app for my desktop and iPhone and after using it for 14 months would recommend the program to anyone who wants to create a detailed itinerary. It helps to have an iCloud account to save files. | Who the HECK in their RIGHT mind creates apps for iPad, iPhone and Mac that do NOT sync data between them???  It makes this and the developers other apps nothing but PAPERWEIGHTS.  Not ONLY that but the developer REFUSES to give you a way to contact him.  Talk about a fringing waste of my time and money.  NOT happy at all!!!!! | I'm setting up my trip routes through the western US and Alaska, this app makes it easier to plan and manage my routes than anything else that I have tried.  And, it's inexpensive.  I'm using it on MacBook Pro and iPad Pro. | Got the app to go on a road trip out west but was hard to figure out on a regular basis | Don’t get me wrong, this is a great app, I love what it does and is my best travel companion, but I’m giving it only three stars for its two major flaws. 
1.- The Apple maps version it uses is SOOOO outdated that there are roads and places that don’t even show, so you’ll have to guess their location with the help of Google maps.
2.- The inability to auto backup to iCloud, like so many other apps out there do, is frustrating If you want to have your route in several devices.

I usually set up my route on my iPad, which has a larger screen and it’s easier to work on, and then just guide myself with my phone while on the road, but is kind of frustrating that every time I make a change I have to MANUALLY upload to iCloud or email myself the new route. 

So if for any reason I forget to send my updated map to the cloud, I’m screwed on the road the next day. If you add something last minute to your map, you’ll have to manually backup again or keep on emailing yourself. | Just bought this I am trying to create a route to bring a new R/V home to make sure it is RV friendly ... 45 minutes later still struggling (I am very IT literate) | No instructions. Editing is very clumsy. I will probably delete this - its just so much clutter on my screen. | I’ve been a big fan of the Ultimate Campground app for years. I’ve had this app but haven’t tried any real world work before. The only useful thing it does is draw a pretty line on a map.
How do I change the departure date?
The itinerary should have a compressed view (location,travel time, miles) next pin, with the option for turn-by-turn display. Some instruction would be nice. | Works great for my purposes, ( here’s the but) BUT can the pins be color coded? I would like to mark when I’ve been to destinations via color code.
      I’m pretty good about remembering where I’ve been but my coworkers might not. | I was looking for an app that would allow me to plan a cross-country trip. This app is perfect for what I needed. Although it is a complex app, I have found it to be very intuitive to use. I’m enjoying the planning features and having fun planning my trip! | Many RV apps out there, not many straight forward - easy to use to plot your trip. Evaluate for your own use but I recommend this for all newbies like myself. | Worst money spent | Itinerary settings can not be found. Not enough instruction on how to modify itinerary function. Not impressed. | This is great app, well done, full of features, all one would needed is included.  Got app last summer, 2020, for trip with kids to explore western US.  Worked great, mapped it all month in advance, and followed path between points, worked perfectly.
Great features, cloud save, export pert of trip or whole trip to navigation software, I use waze and works great with this app, users provided suggestions, maps.  There are many maps to download from community, which is great to start and customize to your needs.
Great companion is MAC OS app, for planing on big screen.
excellent app. | I use it for work to create routes and they left some user features out. Merging trips would be nice. Creating user favorites locations.
A easy location naming feature and also an easy copy and paste feature would be nice. | It doesn’t look like you can change the route pin order without redoing the whole route | Do I really have to purchase this app for my Mac as well as purchase it for my phone? | It used to be much better. Now it keeps adding random extra pins whenever I am using the app. I’ll be placing one pin and it creates another or I’ll be moving the map and it just creates another. | I have planned several trips with various stops along the way. Using this information I can calculate what my fuel and lodging expenses will be. | App opens up and you are facing a map with symbols below. Symbols appear to mean plan, map out etc. but do not respond. No tutorial or directions easily accesible and I just paid 5 bucks for something I am likely to delete. Bummer. | Impossible to navigate to campgrounds unless you also buy additional apps. | I paid for the premium app but it isn’t showing up on my phone. How do I get the icon?? | My family took a road trip from Minnesota to Oregon last summer. We were able to plan every amazing stop, estimate how long it would take and were able to enjoy much more than if we hadn’t planned (Yellowstone, Mount Rushmore, etc!)

Robust options are available. The desired location can be “pinned” and then edited to change the name, the pin image (e.g. forest, food, scenery) among other things.  You can add images, activities, costs etc. Adding pictures was a great way to get the kids excited!  The route can be adjusted, however, not always to the way you would like to go, although rare (same with every other map app). 

The directions were great. It estimates your time to the location (which is adjustable by driving speed!) and then allows you to input the length of time at that location. This feature was great as we adjusted our trip because of bad calculations on my part! 

There are also “POI” which are places you might want to check out, but don’t want it calculated into your itinerary. This helped me narrow down what we could actually do, and keep ideas in my back pocket if we found the time. 

The only gripe I have is that it isn’t the most intuitive layout. There is a learning curve, but once you get it, it’s amazing. 

Worth every penny. | This app can do far more than I have yet discovered & it’s ability to share information with other travel planning apps is terrific. However, many functions, like changing the order of waypoints or adding waypoints in the middle of the route or several other functions are not intuitive or all that easy to use. Buy the tool - it does a lot. But be prepared to stumble & get frustrated along the way. 

The developer says they follow common iOS procedures, but that assumes the average user knows those procedures. The developer has responded to me telling me about several support tools & tutorials that can be accessed by users. While I appreciate the fact that there is help available, I just wish it’s were not so difficult to find. I oversee software development projects, so I am not a novice. Yet I hate having to play with something I pay for & hope I can figure it out or stumble over help functions. Hence the 4-star rating. | Almost impossible to use, doesn’t display RV Parks on route. Very frustrating! | Frustrating | After paying for the app I learn it doesn’t work on the iPhone Apple map. Grrrr

To the developer- I did the tutorial and it didn’t work. I got my info from other reviews. Thanks for your response. | This is perfect for my RV traveling and planning. Not to mention that the author is responding quickly and regularly. Updates are thoughtful and well tested. | I wanted a route planner for my car club. I wanted to create nice driving roads and put them in order of the best route. After finding RTP I built a nice route and opened the POI up in Google maps and was able to get guided directions. Great job. The fact that I can get estimated times of each route makes deciding so much better. I can decide if I want the 2 hour tour or the 3 hour tour.  
One drawback is that GoogleMaps will only allow me to make routes with 25 or less POIs. But after thinking about it I think that’s ok,  meaning that all I need to do is create another route where the other left off at 25.  This way I can divide routes up or start on a different route anytime. 
I know there’s a ton more that this app can do, I’ve only scratched the surface. Adding pictures or saving as a GPX file to open in a standalone GPS unit. (Not sure why unless my phone loses signal or whatever). But there looks like a lot more that this can do.  I’ll eventually experiment and see.
Someone mentioned the lack of ease when exporting from the  iOS app to Mac app. Maybe the developer can add an option that when you save to iCloud that it auto saves it for all apps.  But I really don’t want that.i want to know what version I’m loading or saving, I’ll just rename different versions. 
That’s all I got now | Bought the app and whatever location I’m trying to add it says error can’t load..... spent money for nothing | I found the RTP app a great planning tool for two recent road trips! | I used this app for my 13,000 mile trip across the USA.  I loved it. | Bought this app to plan a big road trip. No real instructions given and I am not willing to keep trying things to see what they do. Others seem to have more patience than I. Also seems to be geared to those with RV’s.  Should be simple. | Difficult to use, does not help plan stops, streets and trips this not. So I put a start in TN, stop in WY, could not add way points, on the route, wants to place them on end.  Lacks Forrest service  roads until at such a close scale to be unusable. | Have to put waypoints every 10mi to keep trip on the parkway. Otherwise it won't let me choose it as a route option. | It will not let me create a route I want my money back this is the dumbest app I've ever seen | Wish I could use this app between my iPad Pro and iPhone 10X tho... | I just bought the Mac and iOS apps. I already covered the lack of real iCloud syncing in my Mac App Store review, so I won’t cover it here other than to say moving trips between iPhone, iPad and the Mac is a pain.

RTP definitely does what it claims (meaning it will let you effectively plan a road trip), but the workflows to do it are downright painful. For example, these are the steps to add a route pin: 1) tap the + icon. A new menu appears. 2) tap “New Route Pin” (why isn’t there an edit mode where these are two separate icons?!) A new menu appears. (Not kidding!) 3) choose “Address” (again, why aren’t obscure options like “from Contacts” hidden under a long-press?!) 4) Finally on a search screen, type “smithsonian”. 5) from the list, tap “Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum”. 6) watch in amazement AS A ROUTE PIN IS ADDED THAT DOESN’T INCLUDE THE NAME OF THE PLACE YOU JUST SEARCHED FOR! No joke. It adds a pin with a title that is the address!

So now, let’s say you just want to change the name of that pin. Ready? 1) tap the pin. 2) tap the callout that appears for the pin. 3) tap the icon in the toolbar that looks like a pushpin 4) tap the words that say “Edit Pin Name”. 5) in the tiny dialog window that appears, edit the name. 6) tap the “OK” button. Why you can’t just tap on the title and edit it directly on the information screen that opens when you tap the callout is beyond me...

The app may have a lot of functionality, but as I’ve demonstrated above, the workflows are PAINFUL. Common tasks should not require so many taps. There should be separate icons for adding a route pin and a POI pin. Uncommon options should be hidden behind long-presses, not in a menu I have to choose from EVERY TIME.

I was hoping that native iOS/Mac apps would be better, but it looks like I’ll be sticking with the Furkot web site (which is fantastic, but only on the web) for my trip planning. | I just want to pick up an ap and have it start to produce results.
A tutorial is offered but also not a flowing help.
KP | Created pin but can’t get route from location to pin | The good: it’s pay-once. It uses Apple Maps data, which is actually decent and improving all the time. Trip plans are entirely private too. It will make a printable itinerary that might be useful. The distinction between POIs and waypoints is useful.  Very helpfully it can export pins to Apple or Google Maps.

The meh: POIs names should be automatically chosen with more smarts or be editable. Picking a POI of Arches national park shouldn’t say Moab, UT, for instance. You can annotate it in a small caption underneath.

The bad: it’s impossible to collaborate on plans. This alone forces us to not use the app. It only supports exporting and importing a trip document file. While you can export it to iCloud and share from the Files app, the other people only get a copy of the file, and they don’t access the same file live as others may make changes.

Furthermore it has bugs around reimporting an exported file, because it can’t handle files with the same name. The imported file doesn’t show up in its file list reliably. 

This is probably great for a one-person planned trip but there’s no ability to collaborate. Tossing a file back and forth would be very tedious and prone to errors. | The UI is not intuitive. It’s fine once you get used to it but it takes more clicks than necessary. I built up a number of waypoints on my iPad and then went on my trip to find they weren’t sync’d to my iPhone and they weren’t there to be imported. So in the end I worked on the app but didn’t actually get any benefit out of it. | Purchased this app it is Very difficult to navigate, very poor instruction . A total waste of money. Tried to get refund but it’s not permit with this app. | I can figure out how to plan a trip?!?? What is file’? How do you create a file? Is a file your buzz word for road trip?",4.17177,2154,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/f6/d0/98/f6d09871-94eb-af20-d208-50ae45f0c054/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/22/93/48/229348d0-24ef-475c-c7e9-62becd48b3e7/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/45/9d/16/459d162b-849a-5cf8-5125-c557abdbb01f/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/98/81/da/9881da2d-fbdc-0284-a2a9-cd3dcefcab22/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/7d/e4/79/7de47955-dc50-aaf4-5b8a-c91d43574846/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/21/db/59/21db5962-ae98-65b8-b4c7-950a082a4868/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/12/d7/65/12d76596-9660-5d31-90fa-6b21c34866fb/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/3f/75/35/3f753570-6259-926b-1f9a-7a16a2dc3117/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/9f/25/aa/9f25aaae-14d8-ab3a-61b7-582bc8989606/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/26/e6/a7/26e6a7e0-d042-5a73-4d7d-047be5b64181/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/93/17/fb/9317fb59-c1ee-02f1-8040-96b1ea749113/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/fd/74/dc/fd74dc4e-d5ac-51c7-ba16-e7c5b92b1655/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/22/e2/d3/22e2d388-6cd7-4c13-dd96-6e548a8c798c/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ef/89/46/ef894621-2ce3-7433-d08c-83ef153b5a67/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/da/13/9e/da139e50-fc1e-6e83-b1a9-029a2b8fadf0/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/b1/29/9f/b1299f6f-2901-81a5-6bf4-c9a56341ffc9/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/af/59/ae/af59ae77-03f0-5c77-9069-53d672e75f92/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/82/a2/54/82a25415-ae2c-e344-0615-7046f67f0ce7/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/0c/2c/e1/0c2ce1db-2be0-7569-94fd-74fc9eec1b2f/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/67/74/d1/6774d19f-3f8f-082d-dbe6-b07c6eab32c5/pr_source.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPh

In addition, when you click on the route (a bike path) the app rolls over to Apple maps’ best car route.
A stinker unless they fix these basic flaws. | ...does everything it says it does very well. It gets my 5th star when it adds a Watch app! | This app is a very easy way to determine the best route to use. It gives many options and is very convenient. | Tripgo makes getting to my exact location a breeze since I can use 3 word addresses! | This app is a true life saver | Makes a city so much easier to use. In Sydney it has access to real-time bus locations which makes the schedule super accurate. Well done | Use this app instead of looking at bus schedules makes traveling easier. Very accurate | I moved to Long Island and don't have a car. TripGi is a saver. Thanks God | This app has been really great and easy for me to use! I just moved to a new city and have been using this app to figure out the best way to get from point A to point B. Accurate, except for delayed bus schedules but not off by too much usually! | This app is not easy to use on my iPad. The stop it gave me had the incorrect train stop. Wrong address. Will remove this app | Great app | If you want a transit app that can incorporate your calendar agenda, this is the one. Great multi-modal options that features real time data for those cities with public transit agencies that provide it. | See how to get where you need to on all types of transport (all combinations!) plus estimate traffic based on day/time.  No other map apps needed | It will move to 5* when the walking times are more consistent with map times. Seriously it's really good and if I could only have one transport app, it would be TripGo. Thanks for your service. | Definitely one of the best apps ive used for getting to or from any where using whatever type of transpo my little heart desires..... But seriously this is the only app I use to get around besides uber or lyft. | OMG!  actually USES my calendar to tell me it’s time to leave!  never have to enter another trip again! | It's been such an amazing help with my travels! All I could suggest is being more accurate with exact times, maybe if the buses have gps, asking them for access to it! Other than that very helpful in what buses to take and sometimes timing is right! | Can't load it. Can't update it  can't delete it. Sloppy programming !!! | Ties into Maps, works fast, is accurate. Really nothing more could be asked. Really glad I found it. | Pretty Useful.. | Hot stop was a much better application it gave you a number of transportation alternatives trip go seems offer one route only this is not good | I checked out your app for help at routing my commutes to various places. I ride my bike whenever possible and your results for bike commutes rarely used easily accessible trails.  Why would I ride on the roads and risk getting hit by the droves of driving texters when I could be on a cement path along a creek or through the woods. This needs a lot of work. I don't care what other bells and whistles you have if you can't find a safe route. | I think I've tried them all. This has the most intuitive UI, saves ten of your most recent locations, compares fuel/carbon impact (& time) btw driving, walking, cycling, and transit.

Best yet, if you give it permission, it checks your calendar and alerts you to leave now to catch your bus. | People seem to make a big deal out of Citymapper, but I think that I prefer this app. It looks great on the iPad, and more importantly, it does a really great job of providing multiple routes representing different transportation modes, including mixed modes (e.g., bike and train), with lots of information for each mode, e.g., public transportation schedules and bike sharing locations.

I hope this app gets the exposure that it deserves. | which is pretty good given the complexity of Sydney transport. Most routes work well and use it regularly to get to meetings and events. Very responsive customer service. | Really great app experience. I easily found ways to communicate inside the app when having issues - great work | This app made traveling the city a breeze.  On the long nights where I may have gotten lost or confused, this app got me back home before it was too late.  It also allowed me to see what I wanted to see, when I wanted to see it.  I strongly recommend this app. | It was very beautiful app but this update messed up everything, text doesn't show properly, no fare showing... showing It looks now like some kindergarten student built it. FAILED! Although thank you that you didn't messed it up during my out of town trip... | BEST TRAVELING APP!!❤️❤️❤️ | I really the idea behind this app, but there are parts that need some work. (I'm using from Denver, CO). The calendar integration/agenda is frustrating to use, and seems to glitch every time I try to schedule multiple events. It tells me that events won't fit, even though there's no reason for them not to. I really do like the concept behind this app, and if these glitches were fixed I'd give it five stars easily! | We use this everyday in Sydney. Easy to use and gets us where we need to go. | I have been using it to plan a visit to San Francisco and its wonderful | Overall, the app does exactly as it's supposed to do. I use it almost every day. However, the fare prices are totally wrong for Chicago. It cost $2.25 to take the L, $2 to take the bus, and .25¢ to transfer between stops. Fix this and allow me to access addresses through my contacts and you're golden! | I am really happy with this app 95% of the time. Sometimes the priorities of which modes of transport should be used gets hosed a bit, but I love the concept and execution just gets better and better.

It takes a bit of getting used to, but there is a lot to the app and it can do a lot of figuring out for you. The only tough part is when you want to override its suggestions it is tough to get your new choice to stick. | Great app, love the integration, but outdated bus info makes it useless to me. 
My observations:
1. The changes in routes and scheduled that took place in December 2014 are not taken care of, which means that suggested trips might give wrong schedules and routs.
2. The fare is $1.75, not $1.50
3. The trips don't show route numbers, for instance, instead of showing ""Bus 167"", the only info given is ""local"" bus. 
Bottom line: fix the problems, your app is a great idea and would help a lot of people when the info is corrected. | Great app. Occasionally it locks up, but 90% of the time it's a dream. | Good app with complete information about transportation. Great to have personalised settings and great to be free! | The app integrates all modes of transportation. For example, in San Francisco, it shows routes using CalTrain, BART, Muni and buses. Most apps are specific to one provider. This one does it all, including walking routes, bicycle and taxi in addition to public transportation. Love it! | And now with the ability to customize preferences and to view the estimated CO2 emissions for each option | TripGo is an excellent app. It's interface is intuitive and how it presents available modes and the possible routes is easily understandable. | Since I ride the bus a lot I thought this app would be great! Let's me know when I need to leave without pulling up the schedules. It crashed every time I tried to use the agenda section. And the hour it did work I scheduled to take me back home in the middle of the day. So much potential. | +100 | I came to a new place to work. I googled a hotel with a distance of about 30 minutes via bus and made the reservation. When I checked in and tried to go to work, this app just guided me a huge circle with wrong way! It took me over 2 hours and made me chilly in freezing cold weather for over 20 minutes for twice just on a single way! So you can imagine how tired I'm after spending over 4 hours! | I just started taking the bus and downloaded 5 apps to help. Trip go was the best. Accurate and offers walking, biking, bus, and car directions. This made my life better. | This app is overly complicated. It did what I wanted it to do which was to compare different modes of transportation for different routes. The interface is too ""busy."" The app is not intuitive at all. Sorry guys, nice try. | Period. If for no reason other than the fact that it sends you a notification when you should get off the bus, leave for the bus, etc. | Until the latest update. I've recently had to switch to a different public transportation app because this one isn't getting it right. Disappointed. | This app may have a lot of shiny features but is only available for people in cities it is programmed with. I just wanted to go in the shaded area and it blocked me. | Has it all, and makes it easy to plan routes. Great app; one I use daily with ease. Best routing app out there. | There is a big bug that needs to be fixed!!!",4.64151,106,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/c7/8a/58/c78a5894-2fc0-542e-b93e-e99bcb5cc0a2/227f9566-c916-4cc1-bc73-12233329fe70_5.5_-_1._trip_detail.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/c9/e6/81/c9e68179-ea87-64d7-dbcb-419c98c2bab4/424158c4-c44c-45bd-9d06-a6aa076361a3_5.5_-_2._results.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/96/63/08/96630833-e4b7-cfbe-4da5-77aa6d8065af/f6322317-e773-4f81-b486-7f6725644d10_5.5_-_3._notification.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/30/49/b4/3049b4ba-1735-0402-ea00-7711d5e565f7/fecd2288-797b-405d-96b3-10286dda5ed2_5.5_-_4._transport.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/08/45/c6/0845c6de-5e45-f9fd-181a-a387b7f737c8/103c4ca6-55ef-46d9-b6d0-c182fe706e97_5.5_-_5._agenda.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/0a/cd/ec/0acdec71-9c2e-4885-e184-3afe818a23e2/a1b1ec1c-948d-4a84-98c1-14322492f085_10.2_-_1._trip_detail.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/45/b9/aa/45b9aa27-bb92-c00d-7366-fac701ff5df0/9c2d6798-2d53-4e6b-a1a3-b1afa29b57a8_10.2_-_2._results.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/0a/98/35/0a98358d-0b59-9c5a-622e-7453482949e1/00a012b1-09fa-42d0-9485-3a54e1fa330f_10.2_-_3._notification.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/33/78/da/3378da8f-97cd-eddb-24dd-d2515de92a8e/d8562119-92a2-4265-a538-6984cffb6706_10.2_-_4._transport.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/1b/f1/95/1bf195ba-227b-9eeb-967a-c9fa36d204b3/4e453041-d790-475c-be93-6b7ad69fd270_10.2_-_5._agenda.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I chose this app because they do not use any personal info | I love this app. You can share the event with others and collaborate in real time with them.

My husband and I use the app for counting down to our upcoming vacations. Great for keeping track of the packing list and any to-do’s we might have before our trip.

I wish there was calendar integration. | I recently downloaded the Remainders app and couldn’t be more pleased. The app is easy to use and makes is so convenient to stay on top of things.

Now they are spamming my inbox. Still no reply. | Thought it was a free planner, but free version is limited. Not many options for planning trip 😕 | When it comes to travel planning there are so many different places to go, no pun intended.  With Travi I feel like I can visually represent travel in time and place.  It’s a one stop place for finding activities and visually representing it in the day.  The app has been improving and I look forward to the continued development. | I like to book trips last minute. This app is perfect for planning them, taking the hassle out and keeping everything organized. 

It is not only user friendly and but also spot on with its suggestions! | I love the UI and design on this app. It takes seconds to generate a trip itinerary and they are always on point with the things I like to do when I travel! Recommended | All this apps like TripScout and similar say they are trip planner, but they are not, they just give you some places where to go or eat. This one actually is a travel planner. I used to go to NYC last week and it created a great itinerary (I made only a couple of adjustments) for 4 days stay in the city. Will definitely use it again in the future. I also hope to see more cities supported, since I am planning a trip outside the US and this one only has US cities. | I really like that there are so many tool tips for the cities. That really helped me plan my trips (when COVID is over...)!

However, I wish there could be something that allow me to explore the neighborhood, that would be so great! I’m looking forward to more features in the future! | Travi offers a very interesting trip planning process where by it schedules everything out for you automatically. 

The UI is very clean and sleek. Hope to be a able to try this out after the pandemic. | I enjoyed how easy this app made it to plan for a trip, given its integration with google calendars I was instantly able to create an itinerary for my trip to Miami. Additionally the activities planned were diverse enough so that I’m not in museums all day! The itinerary takes into consideration travel time and optimized for great places to eat without deviating to far from the attractions! | Awesome travel organizer with a social aspect! Simple, fluid, and beautiful UI. | Every time when I was surfing on Instagram, I was wondering that where these cool place are at. Travi is cool tool to help me easily saving the place for coming travel planning. Not only site seeing, but also the restaurants, secret night view spot, hidden artist performance bar or street, I can have the clue and inspiration from people or friends shred on Travi for my next trip. I will be also happy to share what I explored in the corner of the world as well. | I was starting the process of planning my next group trip, so started the email chain but instead this time I thought there must be an app that can do some of this work for me—Travi does! As soon as I put in my location and dates it started planning for me. The features are easy to use, informative and reduce the time I spent looking for

If I’m going to visit a friend in Texas, driving my own car, I can’t properly plan the trip using the app. Other than that; I love it. | I Believe that Travelerbuddy is going to be one of the Best Travel Apps out there especially for Business. It just needs some more fine tuning “under the hood” and a tweak here and there, and they will Be
On their way to being The Best Travel app out there so far. Here’s why. They get Travel! The layout is superb for the “card” approach they use for your various itinerary categories, i.e train, shuttle, airlines, hotel etc. But, I did find that the card would not always reflect accurately the information that it was supposed to. Hence the need for some tweaking. I did find it Very Helpful however that they have Excellent Very Responsive Customer Service to rectify whatever issue that needs to be addressed. I Love the Fact of how the app has the capacity to tell especially international travelers what they will need for customs, vaccinations, etc. I don’t know of Any More out there that do that! So that aspect alone makes them fairly competitive in my opinion. There were some issues in their accurate interpreting of appropriate  information that I sent over via email. For the most part it was accurate, but not all the way across the board. So, with this said you can see where they need some tweaking. But, overall my experience with the app and company has been very pleasing. Especially since there was an issue with the billing (I upgraded to the Biz Level) and to compensate for their challenges to that, they decided to give me a Whole Year Subscription for Free !! So, that Definitely made my day and then some :) And I have also had the astute pleasure too by corresponding directly with Juerg Founding Partner/CEO and Diana who is an Excellent CSR Department Head. My “Hats Off” to them both for their courteous efficient and very professional demeanor in their handling of my issues. So in conclusion as I said in the beginning, I Believe Travelerbuddy Will Be One if not THE Best Travel Apps Out There Moving Forward !! We just need to Expect the Best from them as they complete their tweaking. For once they do.....The SKY is the Limit for Them !! !! JohnNY Lamb aka The Believing BillionAire 87) Making The Empire State Building The Most Beautiful HOTEL in The World !! !! PS I Presently Continue to use TravelerBuddy for I BELIEVE in them and their Potential to be the VERY BEST Travel App Out There.........BAR NONE !! !! Plus, I Can’t Take My Eyes Off Their Awesome RED Origami Bird !! One of the BEST Company Logos I Have Ever Seen !! !! I Believe You Will See It On The Empire State Building HOTEL FLYING HIGH Not Too Far Down The Road 87) | Great app for organizing your travel plans. Just needs a widget for notification center and an apple watch app. | I originally was impressed by TravelerBuddy because it was able to ""read"" an email confirmation from a B&B which none of the other travel organizer app such as Worldmate, Tripit or Kayak were able to. But it was the last time it was ""great"". Since, It has not been able to read/ record a car service I booked in London, my hertz car reservations for Manchester, etc. On car reservations, It only shows when to pick up the car, not when to return it. Kayak (free) apart from that B&B email had recorded every reservation I emailed it perfectly. This app at $12 is too expensive to be performing so poorly. 
The extra star is for being able to read that B&B email. | Not long after trying this app out and signing up for an account, you'll be spammed by the creator. They don't properly comply with CANSPAM in that they simply tell you at the bottom of the email that to opt out of the spam, ""Log in to TravelerBuddy change notification settings"". Well I did that, and I can't find a means to opt out anywhere.

Making matters worse, the UI is clunky and confusing. Virtually every feature requires you to subscribe. But given how spammy they are and sneaky at hiding any way to unsubscribe, I wouldn't give them a dime.

The only things that could be added to make this app PERFECT would be: 

1. Average spending/daily average 

2. Customizable categories (for example being able to add more categories like visas, laundry, groceries etc) rather than all of that being bundled into ETC and not really knowing how much you’re spending on which. | 그런데 이벤트마다 사진을 한장씩만 올리수 있는게 아쉽네요 그거 빼곤 좋습니다 | I can’t print or send photos of my receipts | Being able to record asap the expenses on the smartphone allows one to track. That helps with future trip budgeting! | I liked this app as I used it during a work trip, but then the report was terrible, not anything useful at all. Who creates a CSV file that’s one column for all items? How can that help at all? The PDF report looks nice, but can’t be used either if the records have to be exported to another form. I wish I could get my money back. I’d use this again ONLY if the reports are fixed otherwise it’s a useless app. | 로그인하니까 여행데이터가 싹 날라갔네요. 이런 경우에는 알림이라도 있어야 하는 거 아닌지 … 기본이 안 된 앱 | Purchased and it doesn't recognize my user name/ email/ account/etc

Won't use- waste of money | Makes compiling expense reports at the end of my trip so easy. Love the multiple currency feature. | 어플은 너무 좋은데 2.6.6업데이트 이후로 가계부 작성하려면 11/25 서버점검이라고만 나오네요 ㅠㅠㅠ | I love this app so much. I’ve used it for over 3 years now and it’s helped me a ton. I love that you can export it to Excel. In addition the aesthetic is minimal! Thank you for the great app. | The app no function!! | Have been using for a few days. Like the app but it is not user friendly. Unable to reset password. Unable to login and only able to use off line. Can get feedback from developer. | I actually have loved using this app, but I switched phones and there is absolutely no way that I can find to reset or retrieve my password. | I love this app and use it when I go overseas.  Since upgrading to IOS14, it tries to open, but can’t.  Please help! | 여행 갈 때 마다 꼭 사용하던 앱인데 오늘 쓰려고 보니 열리지 않네요ㅠㅠ 업데이트가 되길 기다리겠습니다 ㅎㅎ | I’ve tried contacting support several times and I never get a reply. I absolutely LOVE using this app every time I take any trip or vacation to keep track of my budget. 
It has stopped opening! I tap the app and it starts to open but just closes again. 
HELP, I want my TrabeePocket back. | I am preparing my budget for my upcoming trip to Japan with my husband and have run into issues with other apps. I’m so glad I found this one! Easy to set budget amounts and add expenses in whatever currency! Love that I’ll be able to see what I’m spending in usd as I’m entering expenses in yen! Rated a four for now until I get back from the trip and know how useful it winds up being on my trip. | Very happy with app for sorting and keeping travel expenses between me and my partner. No problems until I got a new phone and cannot remember my password; there’s no option to “forgot my password.” There is an exclamation point in the top right of the log-in screen but nothing happens when I click on it. Help! | 어학연수중이라 너무 유용하게 잘 쓰고 있는데

7월,8월 이렇게도 괜찮고
구체적인 날짜 설정해서 00월 00일부터 00일 00일까지의 지출내역 이렇게 볼수있었으면 좋겠습니당!

감사합니다 수고하세요 | 어플에서 사람인원만큼 나누는 기능도 있으면 더 좋을듯 | 앱 정말 좋습니다!
다만 여행 날짜 선택하는 달력을 넘기려면 일일히 눌러야 하는 게 번거롭다 생각하고요
둘째는 날짜를 선택하면 년월일순으로 나오면 좋겠는데 미국 계정이라 그런지 일월년으로 나오네요
이러한 부분들을 설정에서 선택 할 수 있으면 좋겠네요! | 이 어플을 쓰면서 처음으로 여행경비 관리를 했습니다. 사진과 함께 올릴 수 있어서 나중에 돌아와서 뭘 샀는지 정확히 알 수 있고 이것 또한 추억이 되는 거 같아 좋은 거 같아요! 
그래서 다음 여행에 조금 더 편하게 쓰고 싶어서 결제했습니다!! 여행경비 그래프로 나온다는데 기대되네요~! | Kudos to the developer, I never rate apps but this gem deserved it. Very happily spent the 2$ for the pro version! :) | Simply one of the greatest apps that I’ve known.
Just used it on a travel to Florida, and it really helped us to keep track of our expenses, especially when you are dealing only with cash.
The only things that I would recommend for an upgrade are:
- possibility to share a travel budget with others, so all of them could input expenses at any time and everybody would be aware of how much was spent and how much is still left;
- possibility to define a maximum daily budget and the updates when you spend more or less of what you expected to spend daily; | I love the app but the past month the currency doesn’t sync. It just says 
“€1000 = $0 | This was exactly what I needed! It's a great app for those of you who are traveling around the world. You can log your expenses very easily and even add photos or notes to each line itsm. There is one issue though- the app doesn't do anything  when you try to change your trip dates. A work around is to simply create a new trip,
which can be bothersome for ppl who are traveling around flexible days. Also, the app doesn't allow you to set separate budgets for cash vs card. | This is incredibly awesome | I tried many diferent apps to manage my budget for my trips. This app has the best interface, very simple and usefull to organize by day your spents. First time I gave 5 stars to an app. | Although its limited functional options, if you would like to keep up and track down your expense record this app would be worthy to try. | Easy and simple to use 👍🏻 | Thanks for a fantastic app. Just to let you know that Bills could be either outstanding or settled. 

It will be really good if I could see the bills which I already made payment after the travel to my credit card company. | I lost everything after updating the app. You must be kidding me. | Please add to can be manage multi countries and multi currencies in one trip.
Please add more icon in categories.
Please can be reorder list in trip date.

Do the best... | 일본 여행 계획중이라 이걸로 예산 짜면서 하나하나 숫자 넣는 중인데요. 한국 원이란 일본 엔이랑 같이 병행해서 기입을 하면 합계가 자동으로 변환이 되서 총액이 나와야 하는데, 그냥 같은 단위로 인식이 되서 더해버립니다. 예를들면 예산을 천원+천엔 으로 기입하면 총합은 약 천원+9천7백원= 만7백원이 나와야 하는데. 그냥 천원+천엔 단위 무시하고 합해서 2천원이라고 통계가 잡힙니다. 이거 진짜 기본적인건데 확인 좀 부탁드릴께요. | This app is what i want. I can quick create a note for what i already expense from my trip budget | This app has quite everything a traveler needs. | I've been using this app while on vacation and after the update it doesn't load! Crashes as soon as I click on it. I wish it would work again cuz I filled it in for five days already. | The app is not bad. Here are a few things I wish were here. 
- the ability to convert all budget and expenses into one money type. I bought airline tickets in USD and spent EUR in country. I don't want to see separate budgets for each currency. 
- convert the expense from the currency type I used into my budget currency type. Doing this automatically and tracking both. 
- I'm in the middle of a trip and can't see the pie chart. 
- keep expenses I type in under the ""other"" category in the ""other"" category. Now it moves all line items to the current day. In here it would be good to see things I paid for ahead of time like air and train travel. | 지금까지 여행 후 수동으로 경비 계산하던걸 많이 도움받게 되어 정말 기쁩니다. 

몇 가지 아쉬움이 있어 적어봅니다. 

목적지를 나라만 선택할 수 있는데 지명, 장소를 선택할 수 있음 좋겠습니다. 국내여행뿐 아니라 해외여행시에도 도움이 될 것 같습니다. 항목별로 옵션제공도 좋을 것 같구요. 디테일하게 정리할 때는 어느 장소에서 얼마나 사용했는지 적을때도 있어서요. 

한 날에 여러건 발생할 때 시간을 적어 정렬할 수 있으면 좋겠습니다. 꼭 시간을 적지 않더라도 수동정렬은 있으면 좋겠습니다. 

데이터 백업, 공유기능 필요합니다. 여행경비 입력해서 여러명과 공유하는 경우가 있어서요. 1/n 할때도 있구요. 공유하는 데이터는 이쁘게 보여지면 좋겠습니다. 
MemoZy에서 이메일로 보내는 정도만 되면 만족하겠네요. 

사진은 바꿀 수 있는지 모르겠습니다. 

좀 더 사용해보고 마저 적겠습니다. | As far as I can see, this is simply for listing expenses. There is no way to create a report by category.  Not especially useful, when the same could be done with a a pen & paper. | I'm pretty impressed with this so far.  Note that the in-app purchase gives you unlimited additional days, not just 1.  To the other reviewer: you can edit an entry by swiping to the right. | Once you've logged an item it doesn't allow you to go back and make changes. This is an egregious oversight. I want a refund! | One negative is that the app lacks a password | I like its interface, simple and easy to understand (both design and usage). Though it is for travel, maybe I can use it daily life, by naming its name as month.
It is easy to add daily expense and can sort by categories. So far I really like it!

Cell service was spotty so having this guide tell you when to turn was a life saver. Lots of great historical facts about the location included as you drive too. I have so many new fun facts | We are so grateful we found these tours. We loved the stories, the history and the tips were very helpful. We will look for more tours on future trips. | Excellent!  Interesting, informative & impressive.  So glad we got this app! Directions were spot on & the facts given about the route & attractions were superb.  We will be looking to use this in the future whenever we travel.  Thanks for making our vacation more enjoyable. | Awesome experience using this app and very informative | Initial log-in was a bit confusing but the help desk and support person was quick with a response and had us on way in no time. The system was very accurate and perfectly sync’s with gps and map functions. Interesting and entertaining commentary that we enjoyed and used throughout our week on the Outer Banks. | Took the classic road to Hana tour a couple days ago and we really enjoyed the narrator’s stories and history of Hawaii. The one gripe I had is that there is no way you could do all of his suggested stops with the suggested time limits and still make it to the seven pools and back before sundown!

We left at 8 am and only took two of the non must-do turn offs and were careful about not spending too much time at our stops. The narrator gave timing updates throughout the trip and we lined up with what he described as “making good time”. We even skipped the black sand beach on the way there (had a 3-6 pm reservation). We also tended to drive well above the speed limit, more on par with what the locals were driving at as we felt comfortable around the sharp turns and narrow roads. We made it to the seven pools by 3.  Done with the hikes (we were basically trail running) in an hour and a half or so. Got to the black sand beach at 5:55 and were denied entry. Sundown was 6:45 so we were driving in pitch black on the way back which was.. harrowing to say the least!

Again, it’s a great app for the most part but the suggested times spent at each of the places are definitely off. You need to be very quick at your stops or even skip some of the must-dos to be out and back before sundown! | So very glad I bought this app as it made our Kaua’i visit so much more satisfying.  Really loved the stories and history told.  The narrator was a welcome guest in the car and has the perfect voice for this job.  Have become a huge fan and telling everyone about this app. | The app and your worked great.  Make sure to download your trip in advance when you have access to WiFi.  We found it best to run the app through the Bluetooth connection in our rental car.  Make sure you have a fully charged device and a charging cable handy.  A power bank would also be a good extra to have along.  The app synced perfectly with our location.  The directions were spot on and the narrator provides excellent information about the history and culture of the area.  This allowed us to go at our own pace.  We will definitely be using this app for future trips! | We used the Guide Along series for The Big Island of Hawaii. All 4 of us really enjoyed the information and we learned a lot that we would not have known otherwise. We also stopped at some beautiful views we would not have known about. Well worth it. | I figured we had nothing to lose by investing a small amount of money to get a little local history while driving up 61. From the outset, we were hooked! We would have missed so much had it not been for our guidealong. The narration is pleasant and engaging, and not overly intrusive, and filled with good information and tips to enjoy the trip. We took the whole route from Duluth to the Canadian border. Without our guide, it would be pleasant, but perhaps tiring. With our guide, it was pleasant and invigorating. And we saw so much that we would have missed!

we enjoyed it so much that we looked for other tours on their website to see if there was something we could take advantage of. Great price and best investment of our vacation! | Used the app on the Big Island of Hawaii and in Sedona,AZ. Love that we can get great info and suggestions for places off the beaten path. Loved that we didn't need to get on a tour bus and could go at our own pace.   Enjoyed the friendly voice. Thank you. | The app made our road trip Hana Hi so much more enjoyable. It told us where every water fall was, how far off the road also if it was going to be a muddy walk. Where to turn off for the best banana bread.
 I loved it so much we purchased another tour of the Oregon coast. | We’ve nicknamed our narrator “Ward” (after Ward Clever) because he’s the perfect mix of knowledge and Dad humor. We’ve been using the app since its former name and it’s our go-to for every NP visit. | Glad we stumbled upon his App for your trip to Oahu.  We opted to do our own driving tour rather than a mega bus that costed over $100. The app was simple to use and joined us along the route to get started.  It gave us driving directions and options along with great information along the way.  I even found new places I was unaware of having lived here many years ago.  Don’t hesitate, get the app and be assured you’ll have a great time. | I liked the first couple of tours so much I bought them all! He’s like an old friend now that joins on road trips. I enjoy the directions he gives and the interesting details. I just listen to music and when he has something to say the volume automatically lowers and he lets me know something about the area we’re in. When he’s done the music volume automatically goes back. Worth the money! | We went to Maui on vaca and we purchased this app to do the road to Hana! This was so much better in my opinion then doing a guided tour. We drove at our leisure, stopped at our leisure and used the app for all of our adventures while here!!! Highly recommend and will definitely look into this when we take any other vacations! | The ability to go at our own pace, pick which spots we had already pre-selected and visit new spots was amazing. The history and stories are on par with tour operators that we would have paid at least a couple of hundred dollars and still not gotten the full perspective. This is well worth it!  Wish Europe and Japan were on the list for this app. | We first learned about GyPSy the former name for Guide Along about 3-4 yrs ago. A friend recommended we use it for Rocky Mountain National Park. As we had limited time it was perfect - as is the case for all of the tours. We did not waste time on some stops and took extra time in the must see sights. The stories and history of the parks or routes are informative and help make the drives much more interesting. Gotta get em all. Locals told me after I posted photos along the PCH and Big Sur how did you find out about ‘that’. They said I’ve lived here my whole life and didn’t know about that!  That’s the power of Guide Along! | Great job once again. We enjoyed the informative and helpful commentary. | My brother suggested we get your App. We thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped us decide what and for me, what not to do. The history was great and explains the language and how to pronounce names, was awesome. I’m still practicing. I even used some of your narrative info in a local trivia night! If you don’t have it available, please come to WNY and do one of your guides. We are rich with history but a lot of people aren’t aware. | I’ve been using this app when it was called Gypsy. We use every time we travel. This recent excursion was a cruise to the Big Island. We rented a car through Turo and used the app, the 2 other couples we were with had never heard of the app and were blown over on the knowledge, humor and ease of the use of the app. 

Only issue, while touring we ran into others from the ship. Our friends were very enthusiastic when talking to them about the wealth of information they were learning from this app and told them to start using it.  So I tried to share the app on the fly so they could download - to use on their return trip to the ship. No luck. | We bought the Road 2 Hana and it was great!! It directed us to all the keys sights and gave us suggestions for other cool things to see. The narration was very well written and you are given a lot of extra history that was very interesting. Will use this app for many more tours!! | We have learned so many interesting “tidbits” traveling with GyPSy guide. Even when we drive through places we have visited many times, we have been pleased with the added insight the tour provides. Well worth the purchase. | I recommend the GuideAlong app almost everyday: Facebook groups, strangers in national parks. This app has enhanced our travel immensely! I’d give 10 stars if I could. | We should have bought a bundle. Great directions, highlights and history. We won't do a park without it! | I cannot say enough awesome things about this app. It has changed so many of our family trips for the better, and we even plan our trips around available audio tours now (on our last trip to Smoky Mountains, we decided to add on Blue Ridge Parkway because of GuideAlong). 

Our entire family (including teenagers!) loves the audio tours. We learn so much more than we would trying to read about these places in a guidebook, and our kids actually pay attention and engaged on long road trips. We’ve now purchased Grand Tetons and Yellowstone, Utah Mighty Five, Smoky Mountains, Blue Ridge Parkway, Acadia, and more. 

My kids refer to the narrator as “Sir Appleton Gypsy” (they came up with that during our first tour when the App was GyPSy Guide) and share facts by starting “Sir Appleton said…” I can’t wait to use this on our future road trips and highly highly recommend it. | This is the BEST app ever!!!!! Personal guided tour with tons of history, facts and humor. We LOVE this app!!!!! | This app made our recent trip to Death Valley a wonderful adventure! We would not have been as comfortable driving around the valley floor without this app, which tracked where we were and gave us clear instructions all along the way. Add to that the entertaining stories of the history of the areas, and it brought it all to life for us. You cannot miss!! | When you travel to a new place to experience an area this app is a perfect way to make it so memorable.   We decide to go see an area of the country and when we get there we don’t know where to go or how to start    Now we use this app and it creates a perfect experience for us.   We don’t have to do our own research because this app does it for us.  Wish I could give it 6 stars | Loved the narratives that were always in sync with our drive. We used Arches Park & Bryce Canyon.  Both gave us great info about how formations occurred, why some got their names. We really enjoyed the app | We found this guide while touring the northwest and were amazed. Depending upon the direction of travel the guide one will hear different stories that are fact filled and entertaining as you approach an object of interest. | We absolutely benefited from listening to the tour!  He mentioned spots that we would not have stopped at but were incredible!   Also the tour at volcano national park enabled us to see all of the hot spots in a quick and informative way!!!   Thank you so much!!! | I can’t fully explain how great I think this app is. My husband and I are visiting as many National Parks as we can and touring a park with a GuideAlong tour makes it so much more fun and informative. From geology, history, flora and fauna to which bathrooms are better and which view spots are worth stopping at. We named the friendly guide voice “Uncle Harry” and he is a must have for the ride. | Like having your own personal tour guide in the car with you without taking up a seat.
We call the narrator “Harold”. We took a tour out West in 4 RVs with our kids and we all loved Harold. | I bought Utah mighty 5 , it’s like having our own private guide . I will recommend it to everyone !!! | Excellent, well-detailed and informative guide to the Smokies. Surely would have missed some high points without utilizing this app. 
First discovered Guide Along on a trip to Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. It proved to be an invaluable tool, especially due to the massive size of these two parks.
Also, the narrator’s voice is soothing and calm, adding to the serenity of areas visited.
Definitely a worthwhile investment! | Amazing addition to our camping hiking experience. | We have used GuideAlong tours since they began. We love them and we named the narrator, Carl. We love him and his humor. 
Thank you for the great tours and highlights of all the area we travel through!! | Just used this for their Sedona tour. The tech worked great and the tour was very informative.  Really great for getting to go at your own pace. I look forward to using it again for other tours. | This is the second time we have used a guide along and it did not disappoint. I really love the stories and the parking hints this App suggests. It is like we had our own personal tour guide in our car. We are not sure if he gave us a name at the beginning but we called him “Bob”! I would definitely use this again! | This is one of our favorite apps. It’s entertaining as well as informative. I hope you keep adding new areas. We do a lot of traveling and it’s so great to get all this information. Plus the gentleman is entertaining he has found his calling. We tried these Route 11 potato chips he talked about and now we are hooked. We. Take his recommendation on hikes and things to see. We are in love with this app. Add more places please | My daughter and I really enjoyed the audio tour as we drove to the park and inside! Learned lots and continued all the way back to Flagstaff too. Definitely worth the price. | We’ve used the App for several tours (and several more planned).  We love it!   Informative, accurate and a little corney humor to top it off!   Get this App! | We thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour!  It was so easy to use.  The app knows where you are on the road and proactively tells you where to stop to hit the highlights in each area along the route.  And it was informative and interesting!  In fact it was much more interesting than the $140 each we paid for a tour guide in Hilo!  I highly recommend! | We used this app when we went to Rocky Mountain, Grand Tetons, Yellowstone, BlackHills, Mount Rushmore, Badlands, Capitol Reef, Glacier, Grand Canyon (South and North)Great Smoky,Zion,Bryce Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands and Arcadia National Parks.  Every time we use this app, it expands on what we are seeing and what is up ahead.  We also can plan our days better with the Trip Planner section.  We have used this app for over 5 years, and have not been letdown once.  It is like having your own tour guide in the car with you.  Thank you, thank your.
Jerry and Debbi Zimmerman | But this is the one app I will recommend to anyone to buy. We paid for the Utah Mighty 5 package and we learned so much about each park’s history and geology. Genuinely looked forward to each snippet and can’t imagine traveling without this app now. | We used the Guide for Oahu Hawaii. Street names are a total mystery on how to say the Hawaiian names. This guide helps us say the words. Great directions on when to turn and which lane to be in advance. Lots of history as you drive along. Loved it, I think you will be pleased with the purchase and the price is super reasonable for what service you get. | I can not recommend GuideAlong enough. We just completed the Utah Mighty Five Parks and I can’t imagine the experience without the App. It provides great park info, history, fun facts and alerts you to Must See areas. 
While at Arches we stopped to take pictures at a famous landmark and another couple were there doing the same. We took pictures for each other (vs selfies) and we recommended the App. They just smiled and said, “ Yep…we using it and wouldn’t travel without it.” | We used this app for Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, Grand Canyon and Sedona. It is a must have for your trip. We learned so much and it help guide us on the must dos for each place we visited. It is easy to use, quality is excellent and clear that the narrator understands the areas. We will use for all our trips. Highly recommend!! | Took the app along for a tour of Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce, and Zion and was very pleased with all the information!  Headed to Death Valley next and already purchased the tour. Liked that we could upgrade to the package mid-way through once we knew we liked it. Will definitely be using more tours in the future!",4.91916,9376,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e8/97/18/e897184f-2f62-d6c8-32e5-ffc6416bb19d/ab7b99d3-605f-46a8-8d31-fd3b8c154157_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/90/c4/ac/90c4ac39-9822-2339-cabc-e2289a190fb2/e9fa3433-6a8d-4b8a-8a25-9464a0151af3_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/26/f5/93/26f5937d-c1cf-7c55-fe50-612b703e912a/782087e5-7fc5-493f-b070-8b6d4e093dd7_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/62/06/a1/6206a116-660f-5def-9ef8-8d08c0b9e679/6620a77f-607c-44c4-a012-ea012a0de9a7_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e9/35/98/e935988b-24de-81e2-f374-7afeaabbf560/d8854d25-7207-4745-8761-3a3d19c99fcf_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9f/b5/fb/9fb5fbdf-446e-2ef0-49e6-00719ba0f714/333a32ef-144b-4046-b83d-9aef85267673_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/7b/f5/c4/7bf5c4e3-dbae-cca3-b4d4-55f6a95ea123/4921b859-6d1b-4fd8-b7b5-e28fe7a4141b_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/42/73/8d/42738df4-5eca-737a-02d9-6f87fbb34442/40348c28-30e4-4c2a-b341-0157aebe0918_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/c8/6b/95/c86b9559-fcd6-2cfd-7a68-f71f463c0849/7fa9abde-d3f3-47b4-9b34-bea72ea47dbd_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2c/2c/3c/2c2c3cac-ac96-a778-9b4b-274d1fb56797/379d8992-fb11-4f6d-a343-231b14eb966b_Guide-Along_ASO_Instructional_1242x2208_5.5_10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/5c/83/78/5c837803-3cf4-e565-9cc9-fe0055da3504/bae536f6-ff3f-4c3f-9937-5fb476b53ef0_1.1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/e1/49/d8/e149d881-7fbc-d7cc-c9dd-86e0da87406f/5f55d84b-c42e-477b-9309-f3f61be3db96_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/2b/2d/4c/2b2d4c18-082e-3bb5-5cf7-f52129495932/eb204530-6a83-416d-950f-5e7809460e7f_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8f/1a/9c/8f1a9c85-058d-6c44-ca13-51ffd75cc112/241efc8a-a0d4-410e-88ff-4bea9bd05cdd_4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Absolutely nothing fancy at all but very reliable.

I generate a list, delete everything that doesn’t apply, and start packing. | It makes you choose male or female with no opt out. Even ignoring that its basically unusable from trans folks, you're a packing app you don't need to know that. Besides what if you're planning what to pack for the entire family. Not really relevant, and weirdly personal. No thanks. | Options galor | Products very helpful on getting organized and not forgetting the essential that you need. | V. Helpful | app super utile a non dimenticare nulla e sapere sempre che tempo farà nel nostro prossimo viaggio sicuramente la consiglio molto!!!! | Happy it works for others.  I paid for premium based on reviews, but was only able to complete very basic functions, was unable to add activities.  It’s okay, it was worth a try, but it’s just not for me. | Helps you pack and think of everything | The first thing you’re supposed to put is the city. The city I was traveling to would not populate and it would not let me move on from there. Disappointed. | Easy way to organize what to pack so you don’t forget anything. | I think I don’t need much or pack much but I always need more than I anticipated. It helpful to have a packing list - otherwise something is left behind. | I have packing anxiety and I avoid trips because packing stresses me out to the point of a mental breakdown 😆 I wish I was joking, but alas I am not… so I’ve been using this for about 5 minutes and have high hopes that I can pack without crying and thinking about canceling last minute. | I use PackPoint for all of my trip no matter if it is a weekend getaway or longer vacation.  It helps me get all of my thoughts regarding packing organized and make it an easier task. | Great program.  Makes my packing easy!!  Love it. | My friend just turned me onto this app and I’m obsessed! So simple, and customizable. SUPER user friendly! | This app is amazing! I have always been known as an over packer, and this app helps me make sure that I don’t over pack. It also lets me know what I should pack. I love that I can put in where I am going, when I am going, and how long I am staying for my VC. This app is awesome! I definitely recommend getting it. This app, I think, can be used by any age group, whether it is younger, teenagers, young adults, mid adults, and even elders can use this. This app has saved me from over packing. So, I rate this app, 5 stars! 5️⃣⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | This app really helped organize our packing for our trip. Highly recommended | Uses the weather and activities to build a packing list | Where in the world and for how long? Use this and Timeshifter all the time. | This app is a life saver! | Very helpful | Upgraded to the paid version, but still would like additional customization options. Would love to be able to hide categories I’m never going to use (motorcycling, hiking, business formal, etc.) and have the ability to adjust the order of items in a list and the order of the categories within the list. | As someone who packs for 14 days for a weekend trip, I needed this like you wouldn’t believe. It’s a lot better than me trying to put notes in my phone for sure. On the way to the airport with one whole different bag than what I started with! | I can’t find a way to contact customer support through the app, so unfortunately, I’m having to write it in a review with hopes that somebody who can help me reads it. I’ve got premium of this app, and I’ve tried to connect it to Tripit. Because I use a Google sign in for Tripit there is no way to connect the two apps as it only has login and password as options, not the Google logo. I have to go through full site, but the apps won’t connect if I go that way. I only got Tripit, because of this app, and I really don’t want to enter all my trip information again | It is too easy to accidentally delete items on the list. All you have to do is touch them and it’s gone. So if you don’t know what you touched then you have to go through the list and try to think of it again. | Developers have been unresponsive to multiple emails | I create activities for each of the types of trips I take. I keep many of my toiletries and electronics permanently packed, but it gives me reassurance to compare my ready-to-go carryon with my lists. | Such a great app so helpful for packing ❤️ | Love it, very helpful | Love using this app to pack! It uses the weather and you’re activities to create the lists.  Reminded me of items I would have forgotten like hats and other specifics. | PackPoint is a great app. It helps me make sure I have everything I need it’s almost like a shopping list for packing. You can edit it easily add things and it really just make sure you have everything you want for your trip. It also check the weather so if you’re going to a rainy place, for example, it make sure that you have the option to pack rain gear. | I love it I don’t have to think or take the risk to forget some thing | Ok this app is literally a life saver. I am going to Hawaii soon and I had no idea where to start packing. GET THIS APP ITS SO SLAY | There you have it. You deserve it. | Most acceptable one I can find in the App Store for now but lacking some basic features.  I wish I can sort or alphabetize the list, edit the master, to begin with.  And why can I type in wherever I am going? For example, no San Jose, CA? Only San Francisco. | Yet another Packing List app where I’m required to put in my destination. I just want to make a list and use it for future trips. I don’t seem to be able to do this with this app. | Pack list is simple, clean and easy to use .
It’s a great memory aid for packing . | Great starting point when preparing a trip. Saves me from racking my brain to think of the obvious | I use this app every time I travel. It is much better than my memory! | The subject line says it all. It’s simple easy to use. Not bloated with too many features. It’s exactly what I need. | I had my own list however this is much easier. | I’ve been using this app pretty contentedly for years, but this week discovered that NYC somehow doesn’t come up as a possible destination? | Wedding in Sarajevo? Check.
Motorcycle riding thru West Virginia? Check.
This packing app that calculates based on weather and activities is simple, accurate and thorough. Oddly leaves off shoes (!) though. | I bought the premium version to sync my trip from TripIt so I did not have to re-enter all of my activities that were already in TripIt and could plan according to each day and activity. All it does is sync the dates of your trip which you can enter yourself on the free version. The premium version is a waste of time and money. | Suggests things I would have forgotten | Such a great way to help remember essential packing items. | Use it for every trip | Very helpful | Super helpful! Packing is overwhelming and this app keeps my mind organized!

We really learned a lot about what was around us as well as the islands history and culture. We did both Kauai tours enjoyed stopping at a few spots that we definitely wouldn’t have found without it! Great experience! | We were only in Miami for a very short time and some of my travel companions were 70 years old, making it hard to walk or bike long distances to see the whole city.  This driving tour was perfect. It allowed us to see lots of neighborhoods and get a good feel of the full scope of Miami. We went to South Beach, Little Havana, Brickell, and a few other neighborhoods.  The app was really impressive and easy to use.  The guide gave directions on which way to turn (though some turns are quick!! Keep an eye on the app’s path to predict the route yourself instead of just waiting for the narrator). As we drove into certain locations, it triggered an audio segment to play and give us some history of the area.  The guide was easy to listen to and understand. He spoke clearly and the volume was perfect.  I personally wanted a little more content at each stop because I am a nerd, but my travel companions didn't mind the minute or two pauses in between stops.  It give us time to talk to one another without missing content. I absolutely plan to purchase one of these in every city I’m in.  Highly recommend! | We thoroughly enjoyed the Cape Cod tour, learned new things and visit hidden gems we’d never been to before! | This app made our desire for self guided exploration that much more enjoyable.  We loved the valuable facts and information.  Also appreciated the bonus and the various start options.  Highly recommend | We only had one day in Lake Tahoe so we took this driving tour to get a feel for the place. It was wonderful! The sights were amazing and the tour was chocked full of information about the area. There was no way we could have discovered all of this on our own.  Instead of feeling like we missed out by only having one day, we felt like we had a deep and full experience. I can’t recommend this tour enough! Thanks so much!! | It was very handy and gave a lot of information. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. Highly recommend. | We really enjoyed the Austin tour. It was a just-right mix of a driving tour and walking around to see cool things tour. The audio stories were insightful and interesting. We’ll definitely use this tour next time we are in a new city. | This was great! | We only had half a day on Sunday but went back on Friday and was able to pick up where we left off. Took a break for lunch then finished our tour. It was great to go at our own pace. | Booked for April. 
Arrived early , waited over an hour.
Tour doesn’t run until May 
Refunded my money. 
Need to fix their website ! | Informative. Tech support is non english speaker. | Excellent | The sound and visuals were good. We were able to track our location which was very helpful to track our progress. It was very hot at the site so we were able to rest in the shade. We listened to it again later which was helpful too because younger kids with us was a distraction on the tour … | So glad we found this for Bryce Canyon and Zion.  Made tour way more interesting.  Thank you!!! | The app was perfect. The GPS is perfect as it triggers the narrator at the perfect spot to enjoy the view and information. Really impressed ! | We loved this tour!! The amount of information was great and the way it could be paused so we could take it all in at our leisure. | We loved it! Super easy to use.  Full of fun facts n great knowledge! | Viola was wonderful! We loved her family stories and her knowledge of the canyon. Especially appreciated the insights about the Navajo culture. Left feeling enriched and blessed to know her.  Would highly recommend her as an outstanding tour guide. | The tour hit some interesting points, however I’d encourage advertising stopping more frequently and going deeper into subjects even if that makes for a longer tour. | Good information regarding sites on the tour. | This was helpful and very informative as soon as we finally got the audio to work. Maybe user error?
But if this is going to be a “tour guide” then please use correct pronunciation. Some of it is so bad it’s insulting. When visitors are hearing this and do not know what is correct, they too will think that’s how it is said. We used the Mt. Lemmon tour, please fix it. Thank you. | If you’re in LA, have a car, and want to spend 3-4 hours sight seeing some celebrity homes, this is the best way to do it! The navigation and audio was super convienient and informative. It’s like we had a tour guide in our car! I would say just make sure you have a good driver that can focus on driving. I drove for my family and still found the tour very worth it. | Enjoyed being able to put our earbuds in and walk at our pace through the series of stops. Able to take our time at the places of extra interest and didn’t have to get delayed by other peoples questions. | It was awesome to have the tour know where we were and show us the battlefields. It made the whole trip worthwhile. Great experience. | Took a minute to figure things out but that was 90% me. The app worked well in conjunction with the auto tour signs posted along the route in Gettysburg. Narrative was great and not overly long.  Works best if you don’t drive too fast. | Love the program, but I can’t seem to close it. It burns my battery and never closes. | The tour said 2-4 hours. You can easily make it last much longer than that. The insight given through the prompts was accurate and concise. It was really easy to follow the driving directions too | We wanted something to do that was low key after being in town a few days. This was the perfect tour for us. Our son is 18 months old and slept through most of the trip and allowed us to enjoy the interesting commentary and history of the audio track. The GPS feature makes it quite easy to keep on task since it keeps track of your location and provides facts, history, other interesting information based on your current location. Highly recommend this tour if at Lake Tahoe, especially if you have little ones that can use an excuse to get an extended nap. | Our tour as we drive along the Million $$ Highway was great! There were a couple of spots that we never would’ve known about if it hadn’t been for this tour! I’ll be a repeat customer! | We enjoyed the tour very much and appreciated all the information and history provided by the app. The GPS and narration matches up perfectly. Don’t miss the lighthouse at the end. A very well thought out software. | Buyer beware…not every picture on the app matches with the address. So double check with Google of needed. Also, know that Taylor swift has armed guards at her house so don’t stop just drive past or they yell at you to keep moving. | It was a wonderful concept whne it worked right. It took a while to get it to automatically pop up and I had to close the app and restart it a couple of times. The map did not populate to the Apple Maps like it says. It was some cool informations, but it only went one stretch if the island and then stopped. It didn’t take us to the other half where the bluffs are. We were left to figure that out with no audio. For the information there is, I don’t know that it was worth the money. We were left at the end going, “is that it?” | It was crazy to see the endless sand dunes and learn about the area’s past. We took a hike on Alkali Flat trail(not flat at all), it’s just under 5 miles round trip. What’s even more interesting is that this tour also goes along the path and it is very well organized. There is signage but sometimes get knocked down by the wind. Also there is zero shade so just be aware! Nice hike though!! Highly recommended! | Was hesitant to do this but gave it a shot and glad I did. The guide narrative not only gives great history but also provides information on each pullout/area, trails, difficulty, & duration. It was an extremely windy day and this guide really helped us decide which stops would give us the most benefit and helped us decide which to skip to stay out of the wind. Highly recommend, good price/value. | This app is great because they have so many tours and they are bundled together for a good deal. But when it comes to the app design and user interface it is less polished than pretty much all of the competition. 
Overall I would recommend the app but reluctantly because it desperately needs a design overhaul. | We purchased the Palm Springs city tour of the architecture. Pros - informative and showed attractions we were not aware of and had been her 5-6 times. Very informative. Things that kept me from giving a 5 star rating. The narration need to be shorter and more frequent. The day we used the tour was relatively high traffic and long gaps making us wonder if we were off tour. Only one direction. There is a long ride to thousand palms and you come back to do other optional tours. Narration in both directions is the same and thus instructions are backwards. I had to start at the visitor center - would prefer being able to jump on anywhere. We have used Guide Along in National Parks for some time. These tours are overlapping but many are not on Guide along and would prefer gos narration tours. | L I’mau 9 | We enjoyed this tour! Very informative. Only suggestion would be the ability to display it on cars GPS. Highly recommend! | They did a good job orienting us to Ek Balam. It certainly enhanced our experience for a very reasonable price! Try it you’ll like it! | Very helpful with information and direction. We learned a lot with this tour. | Action’s Guided Tour of the 17 Mile Drive from Monterey to Carmel was GREAT ! | Second time we did a tour, even though we had been to Newport several times, information on the tour was fresh. | Love this app. It was easy to follow. Couldn’t remember if the tour guide introduced himself or not so we just referred to him as Howie. Howie gave us lots of educational tidbits about Hawaii and it’s history along our drive. He gave us quite a few places to stop at if we felt like it. We got to see places we would have missed if we were just driving around on our own. This is our second time using a driving tour guide and we loved it! | I’m not much of a reviewer… All 3 of us in our group bought the Mayan Ruins tour bundle which allowed us to wonder around at mostly our own pace. We also didn’t have to worry about obtaining a tour guide at each site. I didn’t even know that would be a thing since it’s unlike how National Parks in the US operate. I though the information presented was about the right amount to prevent overload but get the proper sense for each place. I hope to review some of it as I show my pictures to my husband who stayed home. Only 4 instead of 5 because sometimes the map navigation was hard to orient to what I was seeing - mainly this was at Coba, and the number 9 stop at Chichen Itza crashed the app and wouldn’t play. Otherwise terrific! | While we have used the National Parks tours and loved them, the Kauai tour doesn’t sync the map with the story!  At an intersection we had no idea whether to go right or left. After 10 frustrating minutes, we just cancelled the tour. Very disappointing!!! | I stumbled onto this tour on the internet and I am so glad I did!  My daughter, grandson and I are visiting Nags Head NC for the weekend for the first time.  This tour was easy and fun and had something for each of us! We even brought the dog along and he was able to visit all of the outdoor points.  We were able to do this at our leisure and learned so much about the Outer Banks.  And we got to see lighthouses up close!! | We enjoyed the tour. It could have had more locations, such as more Mid-Century Modern homes, even if they weren’t celebrities. | App is easy to use
Great information 
Very convenient | So glad we took this opportunity…culture, history, geography, music.  We rented a car so this app actually saved us a lot of money since we didn’t have the high cost of bus tours!  Even though we are not experts with technology we did it! | I’ve driven this road for years, learned interesting tidbits I never knew. Kept the trip interesting.

I really dont enjoy having to scroll through lists of station names (which i sometimes forget) - i never forget where i want to go on a map. this would be that much easier/faster to navigate. | Love the real time departure information! It is very accurate. It would be great to see alerts on the same screen somehow. How can we understand an issue that will impact us shortly? | Get charged $20 to pay $3.30 in parking. No refund mechanism. I’d rather just have my card linked instead of having this ewallet set up | How about a real time fully functional paying for fare system and dump Clipper. | Schedule says earliest departure from Walnut Creek at 4:52am but plan trip will not display it . | Unable to book Parking for Hercules bus station, option is not present on app, but when try to book from the web, can see the Hercules city option. Please fix the App, dropdown options | Pero necesitan más seguridad en la tarde y en la noche | Once Bart started running only the new trains, it was a breath of fresh air. Trains were on time or only 1-2 min late. Now with the weather trains are running 10 min behind schedule. This is unacceptable. Passengers rely on the trains to arrive in time. If they have to move slower, then leave earlier. | There are too many Bart delays, police activities etc. Bart trains are filthy | Delay not communicated to riders | This app is amazing. There is a few changes I would make to the trip planner to improve it.

 I would start by adding in the option to be able to filter out specific transit agencies from plans (based upon cost effectiveness, personal preferences and/or shortest travel times).

Then, I would also add in the route list and length to each segment of a journey (like Google does) because it helps riders make sure they won’t miss their stop (especially during their first trip on that route).

And finally, I would eventually add in the ability to make the trip planner save the directions in the “notes” section of the calendar event you’re adding instead of adding everything to the title of the event, because that doesn’t actually help if you need to refer back to it for help while you’re between stations (like San Bruno to South San Francisco) and have no internet.

Make these changes for the future, and I’d use this app instead of Google for all of my BART based Transit trips! | Been trying to cancel parking reservations for the last 24 hours!! What’s going on? | Usually public sector apps are horrendous because they cheap out on development, this one actually does what it’s supposed to do | Within the app, I see inconsistent departure times between the home and plan trip tab. It was frustrating to plan a trip and then to see my train is ACTUALLY leaving much earlier than in the plan trip section (assuming the home tab is more accurate). 

Arrival times vary from 0-2 minutes between what is shown on my app and what is displayed on the screen at stations. | Really like paying with my clipper card. It is very convenient.

Thank you | App is very inaccurate. It was telling me to get off in one station and take some buses to get to the destination 1.5 hours later.
I’ve checked Google Maps and it’s showed me there is still a train from another station. Saved me 1.4hours to get to my destination.
Bart app - annoying | Fast and convenient, easy to transfer | Currently it is impossible to enter and find stations by name in the trip planning list . “Powell” does not find the Powell station. | The parking feature works whenever it pleases, and never when I needed. I wish I could give this app negative stars. | Helps me time manage better | BART should increase security in their parking. I often see broken car windows and my car was broken into at Antioch station.

The app needs some more work, I purchase a reserved parking but was not able to use it. When I tried to cancel it won’t let me. | The ONLY way to pay for BART parking is through this app. I’ve lost track of how many times I get “We’re unable to complete your purchase due to Error Code 6342x”. App malfunctions YOU get a ticket. Should be zero stars. | The schedule I formation from Millbrae is a god-awful mess. I’ve showed it to several people and no one can make sense of it. | Unable to add parking or payments and errors out when trying to do so. No customer service for help. | What’s the point of having such app if user need to download another app to link clipper card to pay for trips?!!! | The new train is nice - the dirty smelly man talking to himself and yelling and smoking
Something probably not
Legal is not so nice | Please have some security guards walking thru often in the evenings to keep us elderly in your trains… we love your service but a bit scared ! | As a visitor, I found Bart a combination of confusing, broken, and expensive. The transit card purchased at the airport doesn’t work elsewhere, which is not communicated anywhere. The card dispensing machines are mostly broken. Our visa credit cards didn’t work. We could only purchase 5 cards on our ATM cards but have a party of 6. There are so many trifle modes that I cannot navigate how to get around. 

The clipper app requires that I provide my phone number and address. Why is that needed to ride a bus? What an unnecessary intrusion.

I’ve travelled a lot, and this was a relatively stressful and difficult transit experience. | Walnut Creek restrooms always locked. Train is rarely on time and always packed in the mornings | I can’t figure out how to put my info on the site? | In a city full of software engineers you think they’d be able to develop a more intuitive app. Shocked to see the trip planner doesn’t even list what time the train arrives or the stations you’ll be passing on the way to your destination. Deleted immediately, just use google maps. | Reasons why I am enjoying riding BART less and less:
1. Too many drugged out people inside train cars who make the ride unpleasant and create a sense of danger.
2. People smoking/injecting drugs inside train cars.
3. People sitting with their filthy shoes on the seats. Also people hogging 2 seats for themselves. 
4. People not respecting standing in line on the platforms.
5. Sometimes people playing loud, vulgar music inside train cars. 
6. New train cars are smaller in size than the old cars. There are fewer seats and less room for people to stand. Train cars need to have more seats as people grab them. 
7. Majority of times able bodied, young people occupy the seats reserved for the elderly and the disabled. They don’t care if there’s elderly or disabled person standing. Elderly and disabled people are often too timid or intimidated to ask for the seat. 
8. Cars sometimes have the strong pungent smell of weed. 
9. Announcements not always clear inside the trains and at stations 
10. Trains not always on schedule. | This works about as well as automated answering systems where you have to keep shouting “ agent”. What should be easy to find and intuitive for a first time user, is not. 
Example:
No way to reserve a single regular parking spot (only multi day /ev)
The “ daily” parking payment menu item is only available from 4am to 3pm so at 3:12 pm I cannot even view to see if this is what I’m looking for. 
I added a payment card and my clipper card. However, I can’t find any way to check my clipper card balance, or add $ to the account. 
When I search parking, I keep getting referred to “download the official app” Hello, I AM signed into the official app. 
Trying to find out if my station still has parking set aside for after 10 am arrival. That question is not in FAQ’s, and “search” comes up with nothing. I have been on many US and foreign metros. BART is by far the worst run. Throw out the corrupt board and have the State take it over. They can’t even hire a decent team for an app. | Not integrated with Clipper App to help customers purchase tickets after finding their route | Please I love Bart but your train stinks so bad! | What happened? Can’t plan trips anymore. | Ooo | You cant pay for parking before 5 | Why can’t you add money to your clipper card thru the app? That seems like a given. | The in app parking never works which isn't great when running to catch a train with no time to stop and pay at the station. | Any idea why the 12th st in Oakland always shows up even though I don’t have it stared? Thanks | As everyone else is saying it keeps taking me to 12th street Oakland. Not only is it annoying but it actually messed up my commute thinking that was my stations times. Please fix this issue in the new update | Always shows as closest. | As a few others have mentioned, the app no longer shows the nearest station even when allowed location data. Hoping for an out of band fix soon!

Otherwise it does (or used to do) what it is designed for: showing up-to-date and accurate departure times. | After the recent update, the app thinks 12th Street Oakland is the closet station, no matter where I am.  Wish I could roll back to a stable previous version. | Latest update keeps telling me the closest station is Oakland 12th street. I’m nowhere near that station at any point of my day. | This app used to work well before latest update. Now when you open the app, it DOES NOT OPEN at the LOCATION where you are at. | Somehow your location accuracy is wrong lately. I live by Pleasant Hill Station and you are showing Oakland 12 street as my closest station. This started happening recently.",4.61251,14865,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/64/98/82/6498825d-5348-3976-fc1f-c436a4e6c8af/mzl.kmqiogty.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1d/5c/e2/1d5ce258-bde9-bb3a-7a49-09b79207f84e/mzl.qrijufjg.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/70/4f/ea/704fea1b-e315-911b-5163-def00897f67d/mzl.sqbbuksd.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/58/be/3e/58be3e71-15fe-c6b0-2197-4f61b79e7d7e/mzl.nrlyddwm.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/73/28/82/732882e4-a6bb-9496-d49c-fef1c320db6e/mzl.yvuhspza.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I didn’t see it but having a map incorporated into the app for the visual reference would be nice.  Thanks. | I created a stellar account years ago. Didn't use it much but I remember thinking it was cool. I came back to try after seeing an ad online that made it look different. But I can't login using my old login (fb) without it saying my email is already associated. I'm clicking login, not create account. 

So I guess it just isn't meant to be. Sad. I had high hopes. | Love sharing all my fav travel moments in one place. The new trips feature is cool for planning trips or sharing trip itineraries with friends. | Hello. There is a bug with the current (11.2.1) version of the Stellar app for iOS. The app provides an option to use a Twitter/X login to create an account.

If the user backs out (cancels out) of the Twitter authorization login, the user will is sent back to an unresponsive Stellar app. The app freezes until it is manually restarted or deleted and then re-downloaded. This is very odd, as I have never seem this happen with any other iOS app. Canceling out of the Twitter authorization prompt is usually the first thing I do. I have never seen an iOS freeze the way the Steller app does.

My Twitter account of @RandomiOSBugs tagged the @StellerStories account online. Please investigate this issue, thanks.

P.S. the Steller app’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions links are not working on the Twitter authorization page either. | I used to love this app, I still do ….

Except for the inability to create stories, with more than one page.

The format was far better when first created .
It was much easier to use. 
Maybe it’s just me , but the changes make it harder to compose stories that allow for multiple pages as it used to.

Also . I was locked out of my original story page ,  for which support was never able to help , making it u organized and harder  
to create. | After falling out of love with so many social platforms, Steller give the experience feel without the pretentious vibes of some *cough* other platforms | This app was so easy to join and will definitely inspire you | Great for finding beautiful places to travel! | I'm
So disappointed that this app was so much better and easy to share to download plus easy to make stories before.  Now I'm confused again it's like the 3rd time changing your app. I can't share it on my social media etc. I'm very disappointed and sad about it. | Love the app. You see travelers’ perspectives organized around locations that are hard to get elsewhere. Like the simple nav too! | One of the better apps for creatives, it incorporates text, photo & video to allow anyone with a creative eye to present their work and/or their life in the most beautiful way possible as “Stories” or “Moments.” | I’ve been on this app for many moons.  I’ve seen all the changes.  Some I love, some irk me to no end!

The best thing about this app is that you can explore the world from your phone.  You can plan vacations, workaround and add to your bucket list without the hassle of talking to a travel agent or scrolling for hours on other social media networks.  

O probably should also mention that  it’s simple to use and easy to share content to other platforms.

Download it today! | So cool to see how this app has changed over the years. I remember this before search was even added. Keep up the great work :-) | I just started using the Stellar app this week and cannot put it down! I love adding stories and seeing the cool new places I want to visit. And soooo easy to use. I’ve been looking for an authentic travel app and THIS.IS.IT! | I’ve had major issues with this app from trying to create an account to trying to post my first post. It seems either something is wrong with their servers or with the app. The only way I have been able to get in was by using a VPN. Even then the functionality still isn’t there. Considering who built this app I find that very odd. | Screw the algorithms, ads, and noise of your other social apps. Steller is a simple and beautiful way to discover and create stories. Turn the camera roll on your phone into beautiful stories to share with families and friends. I use this for trip recaps, building my travel hit list, and discovering hidden gems and adventure ideas. I can’t recommend this app enough. It’s so fun and easy to use. | I love Steller for finding travel recommendations and keeping up with friends travels. The new feature, Moments, makes it even easier to share things on the go! Great way to connect with fellow creators 😍 | This app was so great but I still can’t figure out why they had to make every page auto advancing. I’m having to pause every page and it makes the entire experience feel rushed. There are other apps for that. This should be for well told stories that deserve more than 2 seconds per page. | I started using Steller recently and I love it! It’s such a great way to share travel stories and it is also perfect for sourcing inspo and tips for upcoming trips. It works well, has all of the necessary features, and the user base is full of like minded individuals who love to travel, get outside, and explore. | Been on the App for les than thirty minutes and my mind is blown. Incredible content from real travelers. Bravo Steller. | I used to love this app when it launched but this has become hard to use and needlessly complicated to create. | App is wonderful but I really need to be able to turn the sound off. I have the sound turned off on my phone most of the time so I’m not disturbing anyone else nearby. But the music plays on every story with no way to turn it off. Have to turn the volume all the way down, then hope I remember to turn it back up later. Really a miss in an otherwise great app and platform. | I cant reset my password knowing my username. I haven't logged in for about a year and yet my account is viewable. 

None of possible emails (of 3) received any reset email. | This app is honestly amazing, all I want to figure out is how to move the frame around so the photo i want to post i can center the subject in the frame but I’m sure that’s coming. Love this app so far! | I have been searching for an app that I could switch to from IG, since IG has so many ads these days. Steller is stunning! It’s not as active as Instagram, but I love that there are no ads and I can choose who to follow without algorithm suggestions. | I love this app, but is there anyway to pay for the service so there will no longer be a watermark on the page if I repost to other social media accounts? It ruins the clean layout of the page, and that is why I use this app in the first place. | When I first stumbled on this app, I was a love! A beautiful story book play this year short simple stories through photos and an economy of words would be ideal for sharing. Unfortunately, it has a ludicrous Instacrap format to it that you cannot control the speed in which to consume it. If I wanted IG, I would’ve just gone with the real thing, but since I am not 14, there’s no reason to go with it. Bring back the old storybook format! | I love Steller because I can tell stories and write through a social media app. I’ve only done one post but I already love the app! So much fun, and very simple. It isn’t confusing at all. (That sounded sarcastic but it wasn’t, I’m serious) 100000% recommend. | I really wanted to use and love this app.... I created a story but was unable to upload it I reached out to stellar via Twitter. Someone reached out to me and tried to help but then dropped off the face of the earth it’s been over a month and I’ve yet to hear from anyone. I’m close to deleting it at this point there’s just no point in having an app I can’t use. What’s worse your story doesn’t save on their sever so if I delete and reinstall the app I’ll loose my story ..... so wish I could have enjoyed it but oh well it is what it is | This is all that you need. One app for all your Instagram stories need! | Para mi es la mejor aplicación que he encontrado para escribir mis historias con fotografías. Las herramientas son fácil de utilizar y quedan muy bonitas una vez finalizado el trabajo. Saludos desde Costa Rica | Update: Since recent updates to app,
Some of the best previous features are gone. It is not as easy to format and select styles, captions, and even to import photos. 
A wonderful medium for sharing stories - art, photography, recipes - easy to use. Highly recommend for creatives and appreciation. | Love how Steller has some beautiful and simple templates to help share photos of my travels and add tips and notes about the destinations. The new map feature is helpful for finding unique spots to explore. I also love that the stories can be downloaded and shared easily to IG, making story creation useful for multiple platforms. | Minimalist visual storytelling. It's perfect, easy, and across multiple channels. Done. | I love this app... it’s clean, it’s classy very easy to maneuver. We all have A story to tell. Make it Stellar. | I just started doing this and I just read a review and I feel like the person had some very good points; it would be great to do little family skits and save them together and eventually combine all these skits to become a movie night actual mo a movie type bigger one you can include” just to have them in one place and all of the projects saved. I love checking out the stye 
This is not an option yet.  I also would like to change the theme for new videos etc.  Nonetheless, I will be using this one specifically probably more than a few Thera I’m will to train myself to use. Thanks overall. Looking forward to many acquaintances I love and we support each other. If you would like to pitch in too, show posts to others and get help when stumped, it’s all good. You’ll belong. Children are encouraged to have interest in family stories. Not like is new grannies, and considered more than me and my family adventures aka best comedy to pee your pants from low bladder function.  Overall:    Thanks for all this! My new scrapbook project/ video family scrapbooking new is waiting to start. Too happy to form memories in an updated. | User experience is great with this app. Everything is where I expect I'm going to find it when navigating through it. I find that really important because apps that are easy to use keep me coming back. I'm really loving it! | It’s pretty cool! Lol helped me step my story and post game up a bit lol | Title ^

Otherwise great app, simple and not bloated. Minimalistic yet functional.
Love it. | One app I’ve kept around on my iPhone but the iPad version is less than desired! Like half the apps available it does this weird non-full screen thing that has a black border that takes up 1” of of the screen on both sides! Until that’s fixed I’m iPhone only :( | Nice clean design layouts, and it’s perfect for me to get my artwork out there! Easy user interface. | This app is simple and straight to the point more articles should be like this versus beating around the bush | I’d been working on a post for stellar for quite some time, putting in hours of effort. 
Months later I went back to add other thoughts and pictures to this draft and it’s gone... 

I’m sooo upset. So much work done that I will never get back. 

Hoping Stellar will reach out with a solution. Hopefully they can recover it. | Love this app so much!!! | I can see how this could be a great way to share photos in a story format. I might be overlooking it but I feel there needs to be an option to change the background color. Not just by purchasing blush, but custom color, or even a photo from album. Also I think the option to rearrange the photo spots to where I want would be fantastic. Other than that simple to use and nice designs. | Just downloaded and it’s great so far | I hate this app. Bought several fonts and now they’re all gone. And it doesn’t do a square format for Instagram. Also, the choices in the purchased fonts are really lame. Meh!!!! | Occasionally I wish I could better place my picture in the frame, though.

Absolutely. Did it lead me to meeting my husband? My lips are sealed. I made a group for solo travelers in Tokyo, my husband joined the group and sent me a message, we spent the whole week in Tokyo together and the rest is history. And while we were on the initial trip everyone kept asking us how we met (cause even though we had just met, it was love at first sight as corny as that sounds lol) and we told everyone it was through TripBFF. This of course inspired others to download the app, but we must have told over 100 people. That being said, I don’t think anyone could be a bigger TripBFF advocate than I am. Let me sponsor you <3 xoxo | This is a cool app and a pretty neat way into making friends/acquaintances that are like minded into traveling. I think it has a lot of potential, but I can definitely see this potentially being a little sketchy/dangerous. There needs to be a definite way to screen every user for authentication before use. Like, passport verification, or something.

Other than that, the app crashes A LOT. If you try loading the “nearby travelers” tab, the app freaks out and crashes. Idk why, but it’s extremely annoying. | Hi, i am banned from this app for unknown reasons. I have sent mails to the custom service but not yet received any response to the same. Pls resolve. | I deleted and reinstalled after noticing some bugs and now I can’t sign in at all if force shuts the app. Maybe fix that? | I deleted this app and reinstalled only to be locked out of my profile. The app just shuts down when I try to login | Many glitches in the app. Crashes too | App it’s no compatible with this version of IOS | Hasn’t opened for me in weeks. Also don’t appreciate how people try to use this as a dating app :/ | I would really like it if in the section in the profile where it asks for your nationality, there was a way to add multiple because most people are not just one ethnicity | When first started using was great but some kind of bug now is preventing me logging in again with Apple ID. It keeps exiting app when I try and I’ve tried resetting account & support is no where to be found. | The app is great for solo travel. The only problem is the lack of users on the app. I don’t really find many users on it. Some form of heavy marketing could make this app the best solo traveler app in the world. Had good features but still the app is pretty basic. | !!! | Everything is great the only problem is the moroccan map cut to half we have a lot of tourists visiting morocco thinking the west side is not moroccan please correct this mistake morocco is from tangier to Guerguerat . | The app is really cool and works well. I have a goal to visit all 50 us states as well so I wish the app had that tracking capability. | This app was recommended to me by a friend because we were looking for something to do in Italy and this app came in so handy!!! We found a kind and fun group of people that made it so fun and since it was our first time, we didn't know what to do but they definitely had everything planned out and we did more than what we would've if we were alone plus we made so many new connections and friends. The service is top-notch, the community is great, the interface is easy to navigate, and there are so many options to choose from. I usually never write reviews but I feel this app deserved one. 10/10 | I like the concept of the app ever since download i’ve been having a hard time using the functions ( iphone 13 pro max) 

-Updating anything within profile takes a while or app freezes 

-Certain joined groups don’t appear anymore after joined 

I’ve attempted to uninstall & reinstall app but now unfortunately i’m unable to login anymore.

it was working fine at first. | I assume this app is full of bots because the retention rate for people is next to none. Everyone makes a group chat and says where they’re going to go and what time but no one text among each other maybe once in a blue moon but it’s so uncoordinated they can only make sense that the developers have better things to do since the app hasn’t been updated in a month, it is very bad and it’s going to be very rare for you to find anyone to travel with since no one stays on the app longer than a day | This is a fantastic app that helps you connect with people before you even arrive somewhere.  You can find others with similar interests or destinations in mind and really make the most of the experience with someone to share it with.  An absolutely incredible way to expand your travel dreams and the friends you meet along the way!! | “Would you like to sign in with your apple id?”
 - “yes”
*loading*….
*nothing happens*
“Would you like to sign in with your apple id?” | Haven’t had a chance to use this in action but have already been reached out to by multiple cool folks from around the globe. Can’t wait to use this, interface is great!! | TravelBFF is a super cool app that helps you meet new friends from all over the world and travel with them. It's like having a global buddy to explore exciting places with.

Good Stuff:

Meet People: You can chat and make friends with people from everywhere. It's a great way to find travel pals or just chat with someone interesting.
Easy to Use: The app is simple and easy to understand. You can set up your profile and start talking to new pals in no time.
Find Friends: The app helps you find friends who like the same stuff as you and want to visit the same places. It's like having a travel twin!
Safety First: TravelBFF cares about your safety. They make sure people are who they say they are and you can report any problems.
Local Tips: You can get awesome tips from locals and fellow travelers. It's like having your own tour guide. | Amo esta aplicación, te ayuda a conectar y conocer personas de todo el mundo puedes planear viajes juntas. Me encanta🩵 | downloaded this app to see what trips were available for summers because i’m in school, plenty of trips and destination groups. The whole app is very clean looking and programmed nicely | I’ve been thinking of solo traveling so this app was perfect to find friends no matter where I choose to travel. | This app is the best thing that happened to me. Very easy to use and to understand, they have a premium feature which can be a con for some people but it is only 4.99 and you can do SO much! I love their teleport feature where you can see travelers all over the world and message them! Keep at it guys! | To be honest, this app would have been a cool idea but it is executed very poorly. The app is all over the place. As an avid traveler, I wouldn’t use this app. Who is going to actually go on a trip with strangers they don’t know, unless it’s organized by a company or creator?? That is danger ready to happen. I was happy to see that they added travelers nearby, the only feature I found great, but now I can’t use it, because it costs money a month, why would I pay when I can use the same feature on tinder, bumble bff, hostel world or going solo? What a joke. Like the idea, hate the execution. Hopefully they can step it up.. | As the title says. The app itself needs work and hence they monetize the part that makes up for what it lacks:

You are unable to send messages to localities or places near you, only countries. So if you live in NY, USA you'd be messaging all of the US. Additionally, they monitored the ""near me"" feature which is the only way of finding people genuinely near you. wow. | But here is the problem, the app has low hertz(fps). If you can fix that, it is gonna be perfect | Just started using this app and its a great concept. Already connected with some people visiting my city. Got some points i hope get looked at by the developers-

Improvement:
- add more subcategories for countries like the US where each state could be its own travel destination
- add user verification, hard to travel with people you've never met especially via a social platform

Other add-ons which would be great to see -
- maybe have the option for people to become “local experts” or “travel gurus”. Being based out of NY i have a lot of valuable insight for the many people coming here and have found myself sharing the same restaurants and places to see in many of the groups. If I had a page  could have all of that in one place for people to view and follow if they like my content. 
Could also incorporate past trips onto this page, if i have visited paris and know some great locations i could outline it on a map or with a button to take people to the map location. | I just downloaded this app and I am so excited to use it to make likeminded friends! Traveling can be so overwhelming but when you can have everything you need in one app it helps make things more seamless!!! | best invention really easy app to use highly recommend for anyone seeking more travel in life!! get on it you won’t regret it!! | Just uploaded this app it’s really fun | It’s has been a pain to find a travel buddy specially when the trip is on business days as most our people are working or busy with something else. With the app I could find a travel buddy in the easiest way, our dates were just the same in the same city which is AMAZING. I truly recommend this app for solo travelers, you can find someone in your destination whom is available to share with you time and create new experiences. | I got to meet new people less nervous about traveling now it’s so much more fun | I love this app!! It makes it super easy to find travel buddies & connect with people who have similar ways of traveling & similar interests! Highly recommend! | I am very impressed with the number of options, and yeah finally an app that will make an impact on people who feel like they need something more in their life. | i'm bilingual but i cant like show it on the app because they don't have hebrew and many backpackers are israeli. | I travel a lot both with my wife and by myself, and I’m a huge people person, so I love finding new people who love to explore. Experiences are better shared! | I’m aupair and I use to be in a hundred of WhatsApp groups for found someone to travel with. This app it’s so good. I have everything in the same place. And it’s giving me more trips ideas too. 
Thanks! I love it! | Really cool app, like it so far! | TripBFF is extremely helpful when traveling!! I love Solo Traveling a lot and the app gave me the amazing opportunity to connect with other people and meet up and explore the world together! It used to be so hard for me to find people to travel with but since I’ve been using the app it has made it so much easier! I’m recommending TripBFF to everyone who loves to travel:) | This is such a great app! I was a little hesitant at first but it surprised me. It is very easy to use and you can filter exactly what you are looking for to travel. It great! | Just downloaded this app after seeing it come up on Instagram. First impressions so far are that it’s easy to make a post/respond to others sorted by country and interests. I also like the “plan” section which has similar posts to travel Facebook groups but also has some more niche interests/opportunities. Looking forward to using the app more for my upcoming travels and to give me ideas on where to go next! | This app is very straight forward for everything. where your going, what you would be doing, and the purpose for it. You can connect with other people you are going to travel with before you even meet them which I think is pretty cool so I would definitely recommend this app to other people. | Such a good tool to use when traveling to connect with minded people on the same journey as you! Excited to use this on my next solo trip! | Must get if traveling europe alone! Especially if youre in your 20’s | App page is easy to use, along the way there’s always room for improving for UI. But I been imagined this App and now it’s finally here!! | So excited to use this on my upcoming trips! Such a fun cool way to connect with likeminded people around the world 🌎🫶🏼 | I wish I had found out about this up sooner. This is such a necessity for solo travelers, I feel so comfortable and excited to meet people who have the same traveling interests me, and are in the same age range. It is extremely easy to connect, find opportunities, and even make your own catered to whatever audience you please. | The owner of the app, immediately spammed my inbox and left negative reviews on my Instagram page (Ethan B.).

What’s next! | برنامج جميل 
شكرًا لكم | Best countdown app ever. They make it so easy to make a countdown, and don’t make you go through a bunch of hoops. Love having my countdowns on my Home Screen. | I am always counting down to something and this helps me see how close I am to something amazing or how much time I have to continue something not so amazing 😊 | Was nice for a while but I only used it on my lockscreen. Can't do that anymore so sayonara! | what i said | Since the latest iOS update, app crashes upon opening every time | It’s so tricky and who likes in app purchases!!!!! | It’s my go to app for countdown productivity. You won’t regret it. | Simple but pretty and super easy to use. Bonus: doesn’t try to push a subscription on you like many apps do these days | I’m a data person and I love the layout of this app. | I think this app is very useful! my only negative comment is that it was hard to figure out how to get the widget actually on my lock screen. But otherwise cool app. | Enjoy this app a lot. It’s a great way to see progress visually of anything and everything. 

The app is well designed, and snappy to use. 

Great app. No notes. | It’s a widget countdown app… That requires you to have pro to even use the widgets marked as free on your home screen? Don’t waste your time downloading. | I paid $8.99 so all the countdowns would be visible in my widgets in my lock screen and after I unlock but it wasn’t working. I have tried mailing the support several times but no reason. I won’t recommend it | Finally a countdown app I find aesthetically apealing! Thank you | This is awesome. I love it | I’m currently using the app to keep track of the time I have before I ship off to the navy and it does the job perfectly, you can put it onto a widget on IOS and everytime I look at it I get super excited for shipping out
Definitely recommend the app but there are a few unnecessary things they want you to pay for, but you can get the necessities free | Simple app that does exactly what I need it to. Countdown  :) | Easy to track my plan | It’s really good helps me with putting goals and deadlines . | OMG pretty  progress is the bom dot COM!!! It keeps track of my trip to Florida and I am super ready to g to Florida every day I am on the top of keeping track of my trip ✈️ GET THIS IT IS AMAZING 👍!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | This app keeps me better organized than the reminders app. like it’s literally just there and whenever i add an event to my calendar for like subscriptions or stuff for work it reminds me. get this app, pay for pro, you won’t regret it | Great to show visually how many days to…
Especially good for kids. | but What about Cloud Saving on free version? | I love this app it’s useful and cute! but there could be more emphasis on the “pretty” part! i need more ways to make each widget more unique | In a world that is super fast it’s nice to goals for different ways both personally and professionally. | I love pretty progress! This is honestly just a great app to have! It’s so fun seeing the seconds as well, and to be able to make it as a widget! I highly recommend! | Great app that helps me track a bunch of dates I would have otherwise forgotten! | Good | I originally thought it would be cool to have a very simple countdown widget, but once I downloaded Pretty Progress and saw all the possibilities that I could use this, I bought the lifetime version. I’ve been using it to countdown all sorts of special events in my life… but also been using it to keep track of deadlines, birthdays, subscriptions… all sorts of things. The widgets look great… I would love to see more Apple Watch complication styles, but otherwise this app is great! | Thanks for keeping it simple and fun! | I got this app a year ago and I still use it. I was looking for a countdown app where you can use widgets and this was the first one that came up. It’s simple easy to use, and you don’t even need the premium, it’s good on its own. HIGHLY recommend! | It is exactly what it says it is, a countdown widget for your phone. I’ve had it for over a year now and it’s pretty nice to see how far I’ve come getting closer to goals and such. One was quitting my job as a lifeguard. The only way it could’ve better is if pro was a one time purchase instead of a subscription. I would genuinely buy bro if it was a one dtime dpurchases of like $70 or something. | I love that it tells you down to the second how long it’s going to be! | Love this app for keeping me on track | There's several options with the free version. Count up or down, shows the percentage as well. You can choose the colors you want to use for the font, the background, etc. I added the widget to my Lock Screen as a quick reminder of my goal. | Using this app for cutting and bulking and helps me keep track of how many days are left. The UI makes this amazing. 10/10 | Really useful | My favorite widgets are thanks to this app! | I found this when looking for a countdown widget to help me keep track on cons and birthdays inching closer, and i absolutely have to give it to y’all; i have never been so willing to drop money on a new app. the one time payment for pro is SO fair and lovely, so happy with this app and the styles of widgets!! i’m very excited to see the new things put into this app over time! please keep doin what you’re doing!! 💕💕 | I love this app! It’s a hidden secret. So simple and so useful. It also helps me use my time more useful. No better place to have a reminder that the object we look at so many times a day. I use it for count down reminders to an event and how much longer is to the end of an event. Such as next travel date ✈️ count down and an other one when I travel back. some other items I use this for: - weddings & big events - birthdays/birthday parties - other people visiting arrival and departure - how much time I have in a day to be productive - how long since my last workout (I have a habit to set it after each workout) - kid school events - etc I even put this on my school aged kids phones so they know when an event is coming up. No more “Mom, how long until my birthday/upcoming trip/friends birthday party/any school break and more. The only feature I would like is an alarm / notification feature when the moment has arrived. Pretty Progress gives some reality and understanding to an abstract concept of time and makes it more valuable. And it’s pretty too. | count up, count down, in second, minute, hour, day week, month, or year increments, date formats, and they just added pomodoro timing. it was great before and now only getting better. | I got this app to countdown the payment on a student loan as a way to motivate myself. I love that you can easily change the countdown widgets and that there are many varieties. I’ve had no issues so far and I’ve even thought about what other things I can countdown to! | Actually, this is the one. It’s simple, beautiful and so powerful. Impecable user experience design. I really love every single detail of this app: settings, widgets, everything.

Highly recommended! 👌 | I had hoped to use this app to track numbers of days. Unfortunately, it does not do that. Once you get close to a month, it changes the countdown to month, instead of days. Unfortunately, some months are 31 days, some months are 30, and some months are 28. That means for counting days more than 30, this app is not helpful because it can’t actually do that. Sigh. | This app is super useful, and as a swiftie and an overall music lover I find it very helpful and fun when I'm waiting for a new album to drop and I can see the countdown on my lock screen! |

Very disappointing | Dc | This app allows you to measure and save distances but there is a pay wall that prevents you from saving more than one route. | According to my adult children, I live in the middle of b-f nowhere. Need to buy a small amount of acreage to meet ag exemption so I set pins on the corners of a proposed fence and got the measurements instantly. This app is amazing! | I wish I could zoom in a little closer to get past the labels for a more accurate measurement but, so far it works great for plotting fields. | Although it could use a couple more features as ability to turn on or off showing all distances between all flags, or pick which ones to show, like toggle them on or off. Otherwise love the app and it works great. | I can think of so many more features that would make this such a fantastic tool. What if you could drag a circle out from a central pin to show equidistant points from the center. What if you could tap a line to see its distance instead of needing to find the second-placed terminal pin. Hold down on a line to add a pin? Instead of having to reverse all the later pins. Toggle visibility of Lat and Long lines, and can snap pins to be co-latitudinal or co-longitudinal with the previous pin? Tap on a country to add it as a polygon with its area, I’d love to select a cluster of adjacent countries and know their total area, for comparison. So much more. | Very clunky would not use it deleted | No matter how many times I try to save, it will NOT save. | Trying to upgrade, can’t it is terrible! | Ok | This app has been a good tool for me, when it works! The first problem I had last year was that I was unable to see results for a address search. Witch ended up just being transparent underneath the search bar. Now I’m have the same problem not being able to search,but this time the address come up clear to see. Once you click on the address you have entered you have to restart your search. This was a problem with every address I put in. | I love using this app when I go to the field to hit golf balls or baseballs and see how far the ball is traveling. It’s fantastically easy to use and exactly what you need. Couldn’t recommend more | Purchased app to be able to draw from place to place to figure out distances (rather than always having to physically walk there myself). While it would make sense to have this in the free version, I happily paid for the Premium version to get this drawing feature. However when I opened the “new Premium” version of the app, I was surprised to find no such feature exists nor were any bonus features there at all. Hopefully I can get refunded | awesome tool, w/few restrictions. I’ve used it every week for some purpose. Love it! | Fun toy | Perfect, useful and simple 
And cost almost nothing | Doesn’t work | This app was not worth the money. It wouldn’t tack my location accurately. It also would not follow me correctly. | Works great for figuring acreage in a food plot | Margin of error is obvious once you start using the app. Probably the technology and even across the playing field. Would like to see some editing capabilities in order to manually install and move pins. Definitely could use some improvements. | Measured distance from 2 points.  First from left to right and then walked again from right to left and it gave me a different  number each time.... waste of time. | Doesn’t track very well, doesn’t drop the walking pins all the time, doesn’t draw those nice area shapes as represented... and I payed for this?? | I didn’t find this Ap at all accurate. Off by 100 ft in distance | Don’t bother with this app it’s not user friendly. You’ll spend more time trying to figure it than it would to just get lost and stumble on your destination. | I have been playing with this app for a few hours and all I need it to do is tell me how many feet I’ve walked to measure for small fence. No instructions, just log my steps and it’s never right!  I paid for it too! | This app doesn’t survey with acreage and the emailed copy wasn’t much help either.
Buyer beware | I was loking for this app since a while | Believe me, this thing doesn’t recognize half the locations I put in, I can’t just tap a point and get it, and I can’t get the map to stop thinking I’m in Alabama every time I type in my city name. Hate this! | I know my limitations on my non GPS quad when scouting new areas to fly. Helps prevent crashes and fly always due to exceeding the safe flight distance for each individual quadcopter. It is also great for measuring large field and valleys where I can push the limits on my GPS quads. Measurements match my GPS quad measurements. | Didn't work for me | Only $3 but feel ripped. GPS location services is not available for the app which makes it useless. Note, that all recent reviews state the same issue. Clicked on supporting link: error 404. Needs to be removed from App Store. | Downloaded this app on an iPhone 6s. It won't show up in the locations manager and therefore is not able to access location - which needless to say renders the app useless. While trying to send feedback from settings, the app invariably crashes. | Tried and tried but could not get to connect to the GPS.  If it would have connected to GPS I know it would be 5 stars.  My brother has the app on his iPhone 5 and it worked amazing when he showed me. | I could not get this app to get GPS data, as it the app said that it needed to be enabled in the Location Settings.  When I attempted to do this, this app would not show up in the apps listed under the Location Services (where other similar apps were listed). I'm using an iPhone 6s Plus. | Can't define your own point using coordinates. | The pin bubbles cannot be turned off and map cleared. It's stupid how menu cannot be closed unless you go into some options | Measured my crazy bike ride in miles after the fact with pinpoints along the route. That's all I wanted. | Perfect App!
It's simple and useful.
But your map is not up today!
Please use Google map!
Thanks | Works good. Simple easy to use. It works do not change it! | Great for running ,gives distance in miles and great layout w pin drops indicating accumulative distance!!!,   5 stars!!!! | I like it | The app lacks one feature that I really needed, and that is that it doesn't calculate Square Feet, but square yards instead. I would prefer to not have to multiply by 9 to convert. It's also a little tricky to get it ""started"", but seems to work ok after I get the first ""Red"" pin to drop. If it displayed Square Feet, I'd probably purchase it. | Only gave it 4 stars b/c you cannot reposition dropped pins. Besides this the app is perfect though. Still really nice for what it does. | Nice, usefull,easy to use and must have application | A great tool for basic area and distance. Easy to use and simple to operate. | Great for planning my run! | Really like this app. I can give estimates on cleaning property without wasting gas driving out to look at it.

In my haste to move along I accepted it and promptly got charged $60. All it does is map you to chargers, something that is free in many other places. | Don’t get confused - this app does not pay for Any of your EV charging. For some reason I thought it did. Silly me! Also it doesn’t list my particular Ford Fusion Plugin Hybrid and from the sounds of some other users, it doesn’t list their hybrids either. By the time I realized this, it was too late - I had already paid $39 for a year which was non-refundable. Live n learn! | My wife installed this and subscribed, thinking she was paying for charging the car. The app has no connection to any chargers out there. An honest app would not send mixed signals that confuse non technical folk. | I used to be able to see charging station reviews of other users and that seems to have disappeared. Doesn’t seem to be a way to post reviews either. | App only shows default chargers based on your car. You cannot even change your car or add another car. You cannot determine which connector adaptors you have. Worse EV app I’ve seen. Also they force you to get the free trial to initiate the app. And if you forget to cancel within a week they charge you 60 bucks for something that Apple Maps already does better. Avoid at all costs. | Deceptive and opaque, this app would never allow me to connect and charge my Chevy Bolt.

Then it made cancelling the ""free"" membership impossible. There is NO contact information. 

I want to cancel this membership, and if this proves to be impossible I will file complaints with the California Department of Consumer Fraud. | I really despise app developers who insist on forcing the subscription at launch. Yes, it’s free for 7 days… and easy to cancel… but all this method says to me is “sign up now and we really hope you forget to cancel”. Earn my subscription don’t force it. Let me into the app to see how great and in 7 days force me to subscribe. | Semi new to the electric car world. This app is a LIFE SAVER. Worth every penny!!! I love that I can control what charge I want to be at when getting to chargers. Also love that I can see amenities close by! | Their developer response person can claim the annual subscription is optional all day long, but you cannot interact with this app without agreeing to it. Thankfully you can cancel immediately and not be out any money to learn that this app doesn’t seem to do anything useful. I’m glad Apple makes it easy. 

This app came up as the top option when I was searching for the app that works with a charger that had a non-functional card reader. I stupidly assumed this app would be able to help me. | The App mimics the local power company App for FPL. If you are reading this, beware this is NOT the authorized FPL Evolution App. FPL does NOT charge a service fee or annual subscription. They are very much aware of the scam and are working on getting this resolved, but the Apple Store is still allowing the App for reasons unknown. | I just paid $59 for I don’t know. What does this app even do? I feel totally suckered. How do I get my money back? | Swore it said free month sub.  Got billed for a year and tried to cancel before month was up. Too late. Very misleading. | They pay to come up first for various apps that represent charging networks. You can’t even get into  app until you agree to a subscription (that they’re hoping you forget to cancel).

The app does nothing but give you info on chargers around you. You can’t use it to pay for the network you probably intended to download the app for.

It’s intentionally misleading and they lock you into a sub booted you can even get in to see what it’s really about.

AVOID | Thought I’d give it a try. But first trip I tried to plan crashed the app! | I realllllly don’t like when developers con users into subscriptions. It makes it an unusable app if I can’t even try the free version at all before deciding if I want to test out premium features. Deleting immediately. Make it so I can use the app at all without having to try a “one free week” subscription, maybe I’ll give you another chance. Otherwise… scam. Run away. | Can’t complain | Signed up, registered, free trial. App won’t load/connect. Just spins in circle on LTE or WiFi. At Desert Marriot Palm Springs. Be better. | Can’t even get beyond their nag screen demanding I subscribe to see what is in the app. I’m not subscribing just to see if the app works better than the reviews seem to show. | Do not use this app. Asks for $39.99 a year subscription and did not work with FPL charge stations.  Scam app. Don’t be fooled. | Be sure to note, that despite the fact this app will pop-up whenever you search for any vendors charge payment app, it does not perform anything other than allow for charging station searching and their details. A tad frustrating, especially when it immediately prompts for subscription fee and all you want is to pay for a charge. | Don’t get fooled into thinking this app does anything.  The first thing it charges membership then you get nothing for it.
Links to your Apple account so I am now expecting a flood of spam! | I tried to use it for a weekend rental and kept crashing , did not work. Worse thing ever . It will charge you after a week and there is no easy way to cancel it. Steer away from this app, shame I cannot use 0 stars. | I been charged $39 for a full year and I can not even open the app I would be nice to have my money refunded .
You can now make your own conclusions about this app | I love this app. It gives me confidence to travel knowing that I can chart my trip and charge at the right intervals to get to where I am going. I have never found myself stranded. I love it! | This seems like a work in progress app. It may have some great potential but it’s not user friendly right now. I need to call the 1888 number on the charger to get it working. I could not figure out how to use this app. | You can use its features for free in applications like Chargepoint, Bluedot, and PlugShare. | Seems to favor electrify america. It won’t allow you to override their suggestions for better options you found on your own. Would be nice to adjust the scenario based on own findings. Maybe these apps get kickbacks sending you to more expensive networks rather than free charging provide by some municipalities for example. | The interface is nice but the routing algorithm doesn’t seem to work very well | App always crashes whenever planning a trip to see optimal charge stops along the way. This app has great potential if they can fix the stability. | App keeps crashing with in the middle of trying to generate my route. | I like the idea the problem with the app is truthfully this app shouldn’t have been release yet with all these bugs first time downloading the app reading what the app has to offer it sound interesting thinking to my self this app is something I definitely would need since I drive a short range ev n would need to app to plan routes for long distance should I ever need to but the first time trying to plan a route trying to see how the app function to find that at 22% the app crashed I reopened the app and tired again I was hopeful to see it reach 26% before it crashed again now imagine someone not testing the app just assuming it works 100% of the time to put themselves in that position where the app would have to work or then could be stranded | Unable to even start the app, just goes to a dark screen and stays there. Using an iPhone 13 Pro Max on iOS 15.5 (19F77). | Very difficult to use. Not intuitive and no instructions. Not worth the cost. | I drive a 2012 Chevy volt and from what I can tell it looks like this app dose not support my car. Since it’s a hybrid I understand that’s it’s not your normal EV, but having support for the Volt and other hybrids would be great to have! App looks promising, just could use a few more cars. | ZionA | Let’s be honest here - the routing is a joke. Bakersfield to Costa Mesa, CA. This app suggests that I drive passed Superchargers along the usual route and go all the way to San Gabriel to charge. LOL. I feel sorry for anyone that is relying on this app. 😞 | It crashed on me after leaving the review of the station.
Map is very slow and doesn't update itself. Those huge icons on the map cover too much area and hard to see them because some are transparent. Pictures of stations are faked and confusing. | This is my go to app for finding places to plug in my Nissan leaf. I rarely found outdated information | Just used for a cross country road trip. The route planning was quick and easy and it was great to easily check what was nearby each charger so I could make the most of each stop. | Used my car’s data. Love that feature. Makes the calculations more accurate | Every time I open the app and tap on a charging station near me it just closes and it’s at a 100% rate. Would like to see fixed otherwise I’d rather find a different app. | Great app! | Excellent app filling a gap that automakers haven’t addressed. A terrific aid to route planning and great ease of mind.",4.02555,274,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/ec/07/06/ec0706c6-0f0a-1176-efca-58b07b808032/6c3edf08-25df-41b7-b04b-3eaf484ce2ce_PersonalizedInfo_Preview_Dumb.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/e1/07/54/e1075404-4367-da04-6261-65c070ccd0fa/90ab3582-980e-423a-8270-d5f350dc02c0_DetailedAmenities_Preview_Dumb.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/1f/1f/c5/1f1fc59c-9aa6-c26e-417d-313d370816e1/019f6084-31c1-434a-ab65-231fff1a48fb_EasyTripRouting_Preview_Dumb.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/fc/3e/3d/fc3e3dd2-963e-5d7a-e61e-af7142289157/16436cea-21b0-41a1-b664-c37e0b439ec8_TeslaIntegration_Preview_Dumb.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/6f/a3/c3/6fa3c38f-21e3-5a46-7215-88b020b2cd01/7f7d8f90-6941-4386-be4a-d8063b3d7bd6_FavoriteStations_Preview_Dumb.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/44/c2/77/44c2777b-7908-408a-24c4-f601b8ca27fb/14046221-d75d-460d-872e-a254f3243efa_TeslaIntegration_Preview_U002813_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/b5/76/cf/b576cfbc-5b9a-1fbc-83dc-aec09ac66bd3/252cc9bf-ae89-40f2-b2dc-581b3fb99547_AppStore_Preview_1.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Customer service and concierge respond extremely fast and aim to please | Hands down the best of the best, cream of the crop! Wander has by far exceeded everything you could Imagine! The attention to details, customer service and properties are nothing short of exceptional!! They’ve thought of everything! If there is a Wander property available where I am traveling, I will ONLY use them!! Do hesitate for one second to book your stay at a Wander property! | Stayed at Wander Anchor Bay. Experienced the most amazing coastal views I had ever seen in my life with beautiful sunsets every evening. Even though we didn’t have to we decided to visit Cooks Beach, Pebble Beach and Gualala Point Regional Park which had an incredible coastal trail perfect for an easy hike with awesome views. | Finally we booked a mini getaway and I’m super excited. Wanders properties are absolutely stunning with that being said our trip isn’t until June so I will definitely write a follow up but as of now my experience has been awesome, the Wander team concierge are incredible. They are so helpful. Everyone has been so patient with all my questions . sending me links to grocery grocery stores, sending me links to private chefs, sending me links to the restaurants in the area. So far it’s 5 star experience.. thank you team wander … can’t wait for our getaway .. stay tuned.  Catrina | This is truly a fabulous house, and in the most sensational location. We spent four blissful nights here, enjoying the stunning scenery through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and all the open-plan delights of a truly gorgeous house. Recently built, out of very high quality materials, awesome heating/cooling system, fabulous fireplace, ultra-comfortable beds, limitless towels etc. The outside spaces are equally well thought out, and we absolutely loved the (stainless steel - why aren’t they all made this way?) hot tub, from where we could look over the mountains and forests while sipping a glass of wine. It is very secluded, and private, but not isolated. It is on a privately owned hillside of what must be several hundred acres and 1500’ of elevation gain from bottom to top, and the other homes are also large and immaculate. All beautifully cared for. And accessible only through a secure gate at the entrance to the domaine. The Wander team were fantastic and helpful and made our stay so stress-free. I would not hesitate to recommend this place - and them. And we will most definitely be back here, and are already looking at our next Wander booking! | He stayed at this house recently and the house is spectacular. The pictures accurately describe what it looks like. It has an incredible outdoor space with large, heated pool, outdoor kitchen, and dining area. Our only issue was that when we arrived it was not clean. Fortunately, we complained to Wander and they had someone come over the next day and clean the house and gave us a one night credit, which is indicative of good customer service. There is a little difficulty in getting in touch with a live person, as everything is at based, but I will certainly give them another shot as the home was beautiful and their response to our issue was timely and adequately compensated us for having a less clean house.  the only other suggestion I would make is to have linen napkins and champagne glasses at your homes as a lot of people use these things when staying at an upscale property | What an absolutely stunning home with luxurious amenities and million dollar views of the mountains The home has absolute privacy and seclusion It was spotless when we arrived The wander team is amazing and checked in on us daily We went skiing at Telluride mountain with the ski lift only a mile drive into town and spent our evenings in the hot tub Spent a fair bit of time dining and shopping in Telluride which was amazing | My wife and I decided to try Wander this year for our annual anniversary trip. It was amazing!! The house in Cape Charles, VA was everything advertised and more! It was so nice and comfortable. Or house manager, Roz went above and beyond to make it extra special by having flowers in the house prior to our arrival! Thank you, Roz! Wander is a new take on the house rental experience. My wife said it was like one of the other guys with a concierge’s service. We recommend Wander whole heartedly! | Booked one of their homes for my dad’s recent 70th birthday and it was perfect. Takes all of the pain that Airbnb has (cleaning tasks, inconsistent quality, argumentative hosts) out of the picture | The Wander experience from start to finish is amazing. It’s one thing to have amazing properties scattered around so if the most beautiful places in the US but then to have a single app to manage your reservation and all the functions of the home, the Tesla and more, is the future! Its simply amazing and our goal is to stay at every single Wander property and we can’t wait! 🥰 | Wander “gets it”! What everyone wants and needs in a vacation home! Luxury but comfort, beauty but convenient and openness but privacy! We found it all in this Big Sur Coast house! Actually when I found Wander on-line, booking with them ANYWHERE was my mission, the city/state was secondary. My traveling group of two other couples agreed— let’s go to a WANDER property, just pick one! Can’t wait for our next Wander gathering, wherever it is! | We stayed at the Yosemite property- mind blowing house integrated into a stream. Amenities were perfect: desks, gym, Tesla. The Wander team responded with over the top enthusiasm to iron out my small nits. 13/10, already planning my next excuse to travel to one of their properties! | We stayed at Wander Big Sur (San Simeon) recently and will definitely be going back. The views of the Pacific are unbeatable—imagine hearing the crashing waves and seeing an endless ocean view as you cook dinner, eat dinner, lounge before a fire (either indoors or on the deck), relax in the hot tub, or as you rollover in bed first thing in the morning. It was the perfect reset for our family (3 kids under 14 and a dog) going into 2024 with ample space for solitude but also plenty of opportunity to huddle together (theatre, poker). Kudos to the concierge for quick responses to all our questions. | I recently celebrated my birthday at Wander Anchor Cove and it exceeded all my expectations. The house layout was perfect for families, with top-notch amenities that kept the kids entertained throughout our stay. The views from the property were breathtaking, adding a special touch to our celebration. Truly an amazing place for memorable occasions | My family stayed at the St. George Island property and everything was fabulous! We did have one issue on the property but Wander was on top of the issue immediately to make things right! I would book with Wander again and again. | Amazing quality hospitality concept! Was in few houses and both incredible! Prices are high but reasonable. | I recently had the pleasure of staying at a Wander Yosemite Falls, and it was nothing short of amazing. The house we stayed in was massive, modern, and beautifully clean, exceeding all our expectations.

What truly stood out was the exceptional response time to our questions. Wander's team was available around the clock, making us feel valued and cared for throughout our trip.

Wander's unique model of owning and maintaining their properties ensures top-notch quality. Despite the grandeur of the house, the price was surprisingly affordable. We couldn't believe the incredible value we received for our stay.

If you're seeking a luxurious and magical vacation, Wander is the perfect choice. Our experience was a dream come true, and we can't wait to book with them again. Five stars all the way! | Wander Bandon Beach is an incredible home. The best we have ever vacationed in. Just a couple of short months after our visit, we are going back for a month, with a short stay in the Wander Orford Cliffs home. The views were incredible, the house was warm and cozy, and it was just an amazing experience. We could not wait to book it again. | I really enjoyed staying at the Lake Tahoe Wander. It was packed with amenities, well equipped and taken care of. Also the tesla with the snow tires came in handy. Can’t wait to go and try another one. | Stayed at Wander Anchor Bay to do a week of remote working. The property was absolutely stunning - Wander has an amazing curated collection of locations where you can settle in. 

Wander is a WFH dream, where your stay is accompanied with beefy desk setups and fast wifi, while also providing you with concierge service via the App. The complimentary Tesla was also an awesome offering. 

Even if not working, I’d still use Wander to book my next vaccation. It’s a preferred alternative to AirBnB for when you’re looking for a more upscale experience at interesting, unique, and beautiful properties. | Fantastic property.  We loved every minute of our stay.  The house and yard were incredible.  The instructions were on point and the welcoming music as we walked in the front door was a very nice touch. | Wander has executed their mission flawlessly. We booked the Joshua Tree house for a joint birthday party and it was by far the best travel experience we’ve ever had as a group. From the moment we arrived, everything was seamless, intuitive, and anything we could have possibly needed was there. 

We were welcomed with calming music playing through out the house, AC blasting, a lovely handwritten note and flowers, delicious, healthy snacks, tons of drinks, special medicinal teas, and a beautiful Nespresso machine with endless espresso pods to choose from. Every room had a gorgeous bathroom filled with top of the line body and hair care and anything you might need during your stay (wooden combs, the famous Dyson hairdryer, razors, loofas, sewing kits, etc). I could list out an infinite amount of gorgeous, thoughtful details of this house but it would take all day. We literally didn’t want to leave the property because there was so much to enjoy!

With other rental companies, you feel like you’re being watched or have a list of chores while you’re there, “do’s and don’ts” of the house, the WiFi doesn’t work or the hot tub won’t turn on - none of that was the case with Wander. The BEST part of it all was knowing when check out arrived, we didn’t have a list of chores or responsibilities. THIS is what vacation looks like. Simply put: we absolutely loved every second of our stay and are already planning our next Wander trip - hoping to book every location.

Thank you for everything Wander, you’ve perfected what it means to be a fantastic host! | Had a family reunion of 18 people in early June 2023 and stayed at Wander’s beautiful Surfside Beach property in South Carolina.  The house was amazing, second only to the outstanding customer service Wander provided.  What made it amazing was the combination of multiple living areas—particularly the outside decks—incredibly versatile and comfortable kitchen, smart-home technology (loved the Sonos system!) and the private pool and private walkway right onto the beach.  The location is also first-rate:  easy walkability to several good restaurants and bars in Surfside (or use the provided six-person golf cart).  My family members really liked the house and location and would welcome a return visit anytime.  Based on our terrific experience at Surfside, we are also looking at other Wander properties for potential trips.  Thanks, Wander! | We recently stayed at the Wander property in St George Island, FL and could not have enjoyed it any more.  The smart home was easy to navigate and the house came fully equipped with all of our kitchen needs.  The golf cart access helped with small errands to the stores on the island and the Tesla helped with trips to apalachicola for shopping and dining out. The house was located right on the beach, which allowed my elderly mother to be able to sit on the deck outside and watch her kids and grandkids play on the beach and in the pool.   The only complaint I would have is there is no access for handicap people. There are 20 steep stairs to climb to enter the property but other than that, the house is great.  The beds were comfortable and the linens were super soft.  We plan on rebooking this house again for next year!  Thanks Wander! 
Claire McK from Nashville, TN | Second time at Wander Palomar Mountain, and it was still breathtaking. 

The space is the most amazing place I’ve ever stayed at, impeccably clean and beautiful designed. Staying above the clouds, you’ll feel like you’re waking up in heaven every morning. 

The app was very helpful and useful, providing thorough instruction and giving you the ability to control the lights, blinds, temp, and music. 

Wish I could celebrate every special occasion at a Wander! | We love the Yucca Valley/ Joshua Tree area and heard about Wander.com through our Financial Advisor. Loved the concept, location and availability. The price was appropriate for the size of the property. However, as prior owners of a vacation rental I’m a stickler to details. The initial impression of a steep driveway with what appeared to be rain washout making it a difficult climb. Fortunately we had a large SUV but smaller low vehicles couldn’t make it up without scraping the bottom of their vehicles. Not a great first impression. The instructions were very helpful and entry went smoothly. The house layout was very comfortable. The decor easy on the eyes. I used one work station without problems. The gym/sauna (in the garage) left something to be desired. It seemed like a last minute change. The garage door code to the gym didn’t work (a small detail). Several lightbulbs were burnt out (another detail) The large exterior doors were a bit sticky and took some alignment to close properly. Alas, the main door lock looked so out of style with the theme of the house. We didn’t need to use the Tesla, but had to move it to repair an issue with our vehicle. It had a rather large dent on the passenger side and soon discovered it had a rather significant windshield crack. Probably not safe to drive on the road. The rest of the house was actually very nice. The kitchen very functional and well equipped. The TV’s worked as they should. The exterior lighting and landscaping were lovely. The pool could be warmer for me but clean. I did have to net it twice a day as it was fly and other bug season. No big deal. The spa worked perfectly. Our beagle loved it. Alas, the only annoying thing we’re the 2 lower neighbors who flew political flags that we had to see coming in and leaving. I avoid politics and vacation and I felt these were flown deliberately to annoy visitors as they didn’t like a short term rental next door. C’est la vie! So for me so much are in the small details that indicate the property is maintained carefully. Though, overall our stay was very good. | Imagine a super fancy treehouse with a Nespresso machine, high thread count sheets, a tech set up to please any Silicon Valley explorer (but easy to use even if you aren’t), and you have The Glass House. The show stoppers: forest on one side, dramatic ocean cliff views on the other. Best view ever, and we’ve stayed at some amazing view venues. Better still, an amazing state park is walking distance. The town is - um - closed a LOT so be prepared for that. You basically never want to leave once you arrive anyway so there’s that. Our dog wanted to stay forever 🐶❤️ | The house in Myrtle Beach, SC is beautiful but so many annoyances mainly due to the tech not working properly.  We were having to chat with the concierge the entirety of the stay.  Took us an hour to get the app working properly to actually register that we were staying at the house upon arrival.  That night we discovered we had no hot water, come to find out, the gas tanks were completely empty.   Couldn’t cook on gas stove, grill or have hot water until late the next day.  Elevator- might as well not have one as that was a mechanical nightmare.  Golf cart wouldn’t start even after following directions- apparently there was a hidden switch to turn. Rooms lacked regular supplies- no pillow cases on beds, missing bath mats, towels, body wash.  Most of the tech perks toted in the bedrooms didn’t even work.  Trash bins were filled to the brim and overflowing when we arrived.  We had a great time but definitely lots of oversight by whoever prepared the house.  Needs better onsite management to make sure tech is working properly and everything is stocked appropriately.  For what you’re paying, I didn’t anticipate us having so many issues.  Not sure if I’d do another wander. | We just returned from Wander Ponte Vedra, it was exceptional. Best described as a Vacation in a Box. From start to finish Wander took care of everything. 
No more standing in the Rental Car line like a chump…there is a Tesla waiting for you in the garage. 
Car seat and crib set up at the house and ready to go. 
Beach toys and surf boards. 
8Sleep beds. 
The list goes on and on…

Wander is truly what I’ve been looking for when it comes to vacation rentals. It takes the guess work out of the variability that comes with Airbnb and Vrbo. This is an exceptional home paired with exceptional service and support. 

Will absolutely return to this property. And other Wanders soon. | Stayed at Hudson Valley. Some bugs w the booking/app and shared pricing that I hope get worked out. Need more properties in northeast! MA, ME, CT and VT are waiting | This review covers the booking experience and interaction with the concierge for a planned trip to St. George Island in the fall. 

The in app booking process was very simple and was able to easily split the booking with two other families. The concierge was very helpful with answering our questions since we will also have a couple toddlers and children in the home during the stay. They were also able to help us set up a private chef for dinner and great ideas for activities in the area. 

We’re very excited for the trip and fully expect it to be a wonderful vacation experience! | The SGI property was amazing.  Shelby our property manager went above and beyond.  Absolutely fantastic.  Can’t wait to stay again! | Much promise in the concept. Hope it expands and gets through the growing/startup phase. | The app is awesome! A few broken links within the app but it really works perfectly otherwise. We had such an amazing stay, our only improvement would have been a slightly later check in and later check out!

The house was absolutely stunning and the property was mouth dropping. 5 stars all around! | This is way too overpriced. I get it’s a beach house, but $1,600 a night is too much. | A group of friends and I needed a ski trip escape and we stayed the beautiful new Vail property that is close to Cascade Village. We had a minor hiccup with the fire place not working but we were able to resolve it all in app, which was awesome! The ability to book nice modern properties and have everything available via an app is something I wish all hotels had! | The properties are wonderful but the technology behind the booking is terrible. | We really enjoyed our stay at the Gualala property. The home and property exceeded our expectations and the concierge for check in and questions was really helpful and responsive. 
The amenities including the very well stocked kitchen, high end appliances (dyson hair dryer for example) and the use of the Tesla made the experience feel very exclusive and luxurious. 
The 5 acre ocean front property with ocean views from every room, the fireplaces, the projector television and decor made the stay even better. 
We walked the property and there are so many points along the walkways to stop and enjoy a different view. They even had a giant chess board, hammock, and Adirondack chairs to enjoy. 
Highly recommend! | Had an opportunity to stay at the Tahoe house line up with an amazing storm. 

App worked well for booking and smart home use, concierge team was responsive and communicated clearly. 

Home experience was great, beds were  comfortable, house was in a great location. Sauna was nice but nothing will beat the hot tub during a blizzard! | I absolutely loved my stay at a Wander - the whole experience was incredible and tech-powered. I would definitely go back! | I would like to thank all of the Wander staff from housekeeping to Executives for making my first stay absolutely WONDERFUL! My stay was at the Asheville Meadows, where there description says a country setting but city convenience, and that is 100% true!! The open concept layout with the ability to control everything from my phone was so nice! The 24/7 concierge was so helpful answering whatever question I had, to make my stay a lot more stress free. Lastly, the TESLA! The Tesla just made this trip even more breathtaking. Perfect for cruising through the windy roads and the Blue Ridge Parkway! This is the best vacation rental I have ever stayed in and will DEFINITELY be booking another! I am so honored to be Wander Member and I look forward to the next Wander! | Fine app! Incredible property! Seem less exit/entry and very relaxing. Only comparable experience is a 5 star hotel with a very attentive concierge, this is one to watch | Far exceeded our expectations in terms of the view, architecture, customer support, connected smart home and can’t forget the Tesla that comes with the house. Definitely a quiet, luxurious getaway. Highly recommend. | I was willing to try it. But this app doesn’t even let me sign in with my Apple ID. It just displays the spinning wheel. Waste of time. | I’ve had the pleasure of staying at both the Tahoe house and Anchor Bay house, and both stays far exceeded my expectations!  

The locations, prime time!  Smart house, amazing!  Houses are impeccable, modern, outfitted with amazing work stations and well stocked with everything (and I mean everything) you could possibly need!  I was nervous cooking in the house as in other experiences I needed to pack so many things, but not at a Wander house!  They have absolutely everything to make cooking a breeze!  If you ever find yourself at Wander Anchor Bay and are a golfer, I highly recommend golfing at the sea links course, Sea Ranch! It was amazing, we golfed 2 days straight (would have been 3 if we went earlier in the trip!).  This course is also listed on the “things to do” wander sends to you before your trip.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about my stays, with Anchor Bay being my absolute favorite so far!  I walked in to music playing and a jaw-dropping sunset from every window in the house, what more can you ask for!  

If I could go to a wander house every weekend, I’d be there!  Amazing company, impeccable team and concierge, I can’t wait to stay at another Wander house soon! | Had an incredible stay at Orford Cliffs with a seamless booking through the app! the concierge was extremely helpful and made getting into the house and the Tesla easier than I could have ever expected | My friends and I absolutely loved Wander Hudson valley. It was a dream come true to live in such a place even if it was for a little while. Everything was top notch and the concierge was always on point. Cant wait to go to the next Wander adventure!! | We had the stay of a lifetime at their Asheville location. Amazing views and the perfect modernized home made for an incredibly relaxing vacation on the hillside. | They have like 7 properties to choose from all over the states. What’s worse is the pricing does not show up until you are about 10 clicks into the booking process and in my case the page kept spinning and I never saw the final prices due to some bugs in the app 

Beautiful properties , insufficient inventory and buggy app | My company hosted a team retreat at Wander Bandon Dunes and the experience was incredible! The design of the house and views of the ocean are absolutely breathtakingly. We even had a private chef on site cooking all of our meals, the whole experience was absolutely magical!",4.65913,531,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/93/e2/25/93e2253f-00f5-3bbe-8eec-d343dbcae7a9/e1e0552c-5416-4776-a5b4-7f31aa25e4f1_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/27/01/bf/2701bf74-e08e-8f44-c7bb-feead14c3104/6fe5ead8-f756-4e98-bbd1-050e7b429b5a_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/09/bc/b1/09bcb12f-9ef4-0a49-7ce5-ff58d3edc4f6/40baa4fe-984d-4bdc-a050-a2fb8eaefb26_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/77/9a/72/779a72e8-24be-76f0-71a0-c3ae2fe8815d/b55bed28-1f98-4845-b83a-61281f90579c_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/62/9a/f1/629af143-e2c9-d2b0-a084-a76bda301441/5a2c1781-6235-45d6-bdf2-804b58c56af2_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/e1/7f/2f/e17f2f24-58e1-2b83-e1c5-8e2a1328e315/4b14ae11-0d7b-4486-9ff1-f5758c0233bc_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/5f/c4/ca/5fc4ca2d-7d12-0ea7-0997-4e03e3b147af/45bf8c8f-e448-4ae5-88af-aedfa3e408d0_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I want a notice when the price drops. I also want economy, but not basic economy. It tells me three times a day that it’s time to book, but the price is steady, not dropped. And will not give me the different economy options, only the restricted one where I can’t pick seats in advance. It offers me to filter but the filter doesn’t take. I had to stop notifications-this app is not helpful in any way. | I love this app it’s very easy and convenient to book. | I really like how you can get on and search very fast and the results are amazing. Keep up the good work , this my first time catching a plane and this was the first site that won’t confusing honestly very honestly | FlightHub was more than $100 cheaper than the airline. Thank you. | Not sure what’s going on but the app do not work for me anymore, no matter what date I search for a flight nothing happens And there is no where to get support for the app | Horrible experience with this company. I always buy tickets with edreams and never had any issue. This time I wanted to try flighthub because of all the good reviews. This app gave me an option to transfer from Canada, which apparently needs a transit visa, without any warning. I found out by luck one day before my flight and had to pay twice as much as my original ticket to change the flight. Checked three other websites and no other website shows you flight options where you need visa for transit. How is the customer supposed to know this??? Unbelievable. | Service is horrible. They never get back to you | Best prices, ease to navigate | best prices | I want my refund | Easy peasy!;)! | My flight was canceled by the airline, and flight hub only gave me back money for the flight there. I honestly feel like I got scammed. Never using again. | I downloaded over than 15 apps to do my books and this is the application fastest and easiest ion all of them, thank you FlightHub | First time I’m flying with this airline I loved the price as I’m in need of a good price m | 10 | I booked a flight from San Francisco to Manila and my connecting flight was cancelled. I never received an email from the airline or Flighthub about the cancellation, so I didn’t learn about it until the day before my flight. I had no choice but to pay their $35 fee to refund my ticket and it’ll take 12-18 weeks to process it. Never using Flighthub again and I suggest you don’t either. 👎 | I bought a ticket in this company in December 2019, due to the pandemic my mother could not travel in April 2020, FligthHub said that he would return the money in a voucher twice and 5 months have passed and I have not received anything!  I bought the ticket with the Kayak app, I spoke with FligthHub on three occasions telling me that there was no problem and they would give me the voucher, liars!  they never gave me anything!  I do not understand how companies like kayaking can have you!  I am completely disappointed! | I wish there was an 800 number to give more details about the insurance or a brief description that is more detailed without having to click here and there to find it | Awesome | Booking was painless! | I booked a flight for a friend. Within 15 minutes dates changed but I could not modify my dates. I booked a 2nd flight figuring it was within 24 hours I’d just cancel the first. Yeah...no. The site would not let me cancel. I spend 30 minutes on hold to be told I had to call flight hub. Why the hell is just flys number on flight hubs site. I call flight hub to get the exact same menu option and stale hold music but for a hour this time. $75 to cancel. I have to pay this before getting credited. Cannot take it out of my credit. No thanks. Never again. Enjoy the $75 it’ll be the last. | I have a health condition that requires I sit in the front of the plane with extra room - so I have to purchase first class, but I want to find the least expensive option. I tried to search for a first class ticket REPEATEDLY! which IS an option they SUPPOSEDLY offer! But EVERY single search result was filled with economy flights. So, it was impossible to find the least expensive first class ticket. Then when I tried to “filter” the results I found there wasn’t an option to filter for first class ONLY to list it at the beginning of the search - which OBVIOUSLY does NO good! 

The search function in this app is worthless! Save yourself time and choose one of the MANY other travel app options! | Would give zero Stars if I could. I entered my dates and made the reservation. It was no cheaper than other sites. I double-checked and confirmed the reservation. Got my itinerary and they had me leaving a day late. Mistake on their end, they still charged me cancellation fee of $75. Never using this service again. | I have an account, I have an itinerary. What I don’t have is access to my account to through the app. The login screen flashes a lot and I cannot login. | Cheapest compared to others. Thank you FlightHub! | I’m 40 and scared! Lol 
So far so good! The booking was extremely simple. This is the cheapest out there I’ve looked at. Let’s hope the rest my experience is the same. Please don’t make me the next character in Alanis Morissette! 😳 | I have consistently found them to be cheaper than other sites!  They encourage me to travel more often! | Flight Hub App FAST AND EASY to USE!!! Exceptional prices!!! Thank you!!! | DO NOT USE THIS APP!  REVIEWS ARE FAKE!  They stole my Money and tried to tell me I couldn’t book a flight. Took the money out of my account and the tried to charge my account an additional 4 times for an even higher amount than what my flight was worth.  This is more like a criminal enterprise than a booking service. DO NOT USE FLIGHTHUB! | Gave me options to find the cheapest and even fastest flights to my destination by the date and how much it would be if I extended my dates, and booking was simple too... 👍🏾 | Saved me $100 | Fast and easy | I love to book flights here | Best App I have ever used to book flight tickets.
So easy to use! I really like it! | I hate shopping around for the best price, but I hate paying more than I have to even more. Flight hub made finding the best price so easy and quickly too! If my actual travel experience goes as well as booking the flight, I not only will be thrilled, but I will be a convert for life! | This has been my BEST experience ever ordering a plane ticket. One less thing to worry about. | I’m from nyc and every 3 weeks I always book a flight here to visit my girlfriend in Toronto & it’s so easy! Just select the flights I want ahead of time and there’s no problem! | I just booked the same exact flight on AA - cancelled it and saved $50 on this app! ❤️❤️ | This is my first time using this app I love it fast and essay | Fast and easy. Who could ask more? | They don’t speak much English. they aren’t clear on what your needs are so they just claim they they understand you. They were supposed to reserve my seat, meal and baggage check. They didn’t and I got charged for it. The airline had to give me a full refund BUT flighthub used their own credit card to pay for my reservation. Now flighthub gets the refund and I dont! OMG! IM STILL going through red tape to get my fee back! DONT TRUST THIS APP! | If you book the wrong date and you call right away they will make sure to confirm the flight while they put in hold to make sure that they can charge you cancelation fee. Technology is aware of time FlightHub, it will confirm the seconds that I called and the seconds that you put me in hold to take the time to make sure that the flight was confirmed. I know you did it because I have the confirmation when you clicked it.  You are bad people! | Took some looking into but I think we got the best deal on the Internet. Fingers crossed! | Easy to use plenty of flight options and price is as says | Was stranded for the holidays until I found this app | I’m a avid traveler so I’m always seeking the best deals! This is my new go to app! Some of the best deals on the planet are right here! Thank you Flighf hub 

QD x | You have to stay on hold for long periods to deal with any questions.  Changes to the itinerary weren’t even sent and I only found out about them when I called to confirm times of flights. Last minute flight change notifications were cryptic and you couldn’t even tell what had changed. Would never book with them again!!!!! | FlightHub gets you the best flights! | The price shown says taxes and fees included when you do a search but when you go check out it will show a completely different price. I just tried to book a ticket advertised at $998 but when I went to checkout the price per passenger was $1348. I called customer care to ask and they told me they don’t even have that deal in their system. I thought I was getting a deal but back to the drawing board. So frustrating! | Flighthub has become my go to flight station for all flights within and outside USA. Their prices are affordable and my experience has remained splendid thus

Now that they upgraded it’s not my fav. I click on an crackle barrel icon blurry pop and I can’t click to open! | This is the best app I have located for putting in a long distance and having the software put in stops for you. I’m planning a long trip from Texas to Alaska and I want to average 400 miles a day. The app is good for that, however, if you inadvertently put a stop in the wrong order, the only way I’ve been able to figure out how to move it is to log into the app via a browser.  In my quest for trying to figure out how to fix that  problem, I’ve discovered that there is absolutely zero support for this product. They offer no help options and when you want to manage your subscription, you’re taken to an Apple page. So it has some good features. I can’t give it more than a three because of these other problems. | This began as a great app. I even bought into the annual $19.99 plan. My bank account was debited in August 2023 and now we are ready to go on our trips that we had logged into this app and everything is gone. Three years of travel, notes, places, and all my account information is gone. They took their money, but have not resolved this issue. They have zero contact information. If you’re going to pay for a travel app, pick a different one. | My friend is planning a westward trip this summer. Your app is great for one person planning. I have found that the only place I can open this trip is from his emails to me. I cannot save this in my own app. This is very inconvenient for me. We both have the pro version. | We travel six to seven months a year and average five days at any location. We make our summer plans in February for those months of travel. My concern is that I do not see yearly updates on prices per night. We try to stay within a budget so price is most important. I promise I will do a better job of reviews this year! We sure do get in some substandard locations! Thanks! 😎 | This used to be a useful free app for logging trips and calculating fuel expenses.  It still serves those purposes but now you pay a premium for it.  The app is a little antiquated to be charging so buyer be warned | I use RVParky on my Mac Air and iphone so it is all around easy.  Using the phone while traveling and yet the larger Mac screen for planning.  I love the storage feature to go back and look at old trips as well and the ease of exploring new trips. | I have been FT since 2019 and Love this app. Great value for the price. For something that works this great and ease of use it is worth it to me. | I love this app so much!! I’ve referred it to many friends and family!! I’m wondering why now I have to have a paid account to save my locations. In the past I’ve easily done this and didn’t have to pay. Now disappointed. | Love the app use it a lot.  Ever since the last update on iOS my app stopped working.  Deleted and tried reinstalling still no luck.  Where do I find help?? | Used to be a great app. Now there’s a forced upgrade to the “pro” version to make more than a 3 stop trip plan. App just became useless unless you buy the PRO version. | I always use this great app to find suitable places to stop. | I’m loving the new updates… fixed some of those things I found irritating such as not being able to lock dates down. Also, loved the split distance function!. Can we print hard copy yet? | I have used this app for the last three years. It was basic at first but they have added great features to the product. We find it very easy to use. You can print your itinerary or send it on to family and friends. As you’re planning your trip and have specific dates to hit locations you can lock them in. The app then tells you how many days you have to meet that date. We used this app for our 7 month travel. Just love it. Thank you for all the new features! | When I upgraded and paid for the yearly subscription it gave me a whole new identifier and now I have no way to continue on a previous trip I had already started. There should be a way to merge accounts. | After being introduced to this app a few years ago, I have used it for multiple day trips without the RV, family camping trips and I’m currently on my 3rd cross country road trip and using this app constantly!!

As if the sheer usefulness wasn’t enough, they have great customer service!! On this trip I was having trouble reading road names on the map. (The eyes are aging lol). Zooming in made the image bigger but not the words. I submitted feedback within the app expecting no response but hoping it would get to developers and they’d consider it. In less than 1.5 hours Lenny emailed me about it! After me sending screen shots to clarify the issue, he send a link with directions to address it. The issue was with Apple Maps, not this app, but he still made sure to help me!

Helpful on shorter trips, RVParky really shines on longer road trips!  Especially when driving out west, where exits can be few and far between, it’s important to know not only where service is available, but also if that service is accessible to a large vehicle!!! We sometimes stop an hour earlier than we “have” to, simply because with this app we can see that the gas station “just a few more miles down the road” does not have an rv friendly layout. 

Plus, there are so many variables when you’re on a long road trip. Things like picking up a nail in your tire that has to be repaired or interstate being closed due to bad wreck so you have to detour and lose several hours of your planned drive time. It’s easy to determine a new destination for the night. Beautiful fall weather? Search places that you can park for free and boondock, then hit the road early in the morning to make up for lost time.  Been driving through the Mohave in July? Find a park with full hookups for shower and AC where you can wake up to a beautiful view of Lake Mead. 

At home, I use it to help scout campgrounds for our family trips or find a good gas station with access appropriate for the RV while on said trips. 

For Day trips, I can find multiples options for a gas stop based on distance, rest stops for potty breaks, etc. 

Whether it’s planning ahead by months, or by hours, this app has been amazing to help us find what we need, when and where we need it!!! | Loved this app, however no longer works with my iPhone. I have uninstalled and installed no luck! It comes up but cannot tap and open any campground. Have to look at other apps🥲 | I don’t know what happened but a very nice app is now totally crap and no one is there in magical computer land to help or fix. At this point i would recommend NOT USING RV PARKY until they figure out customer service and support when they totally screw up a very nice app | This review is posted 06-24-2023.

This WAS the greatest travel app of all time. I recommended it to everyone I met for travel planning. Earlier this year the developers started charging $20 for an annual subscription (no annoying ads, which the app never had before). I gladly paid as the app was worth the price. 

BOY, HAVE THINGS CHANGED! The app is now very unresponsive when trying to add overnight stays or plot stops along a route. Sites are visible on the map, but one cannot add them to a route. This is not a filter setting, it is a flaw in the newly updated app. Very disappointed. | I’ve used this app 3yrs but recently ads have appeared, which I understand and have tolerated as that is great way for developer to earn $$. However, now developer locked app features and warned (with big red ugly banner located at top of each trip) that app will not work for more than 3 stops in addition to ads for non-payers. WTH. I would gladly pay a one time fee to eliminate ads like other apps offer, but it’s irritating developer is severely locking down the app, therefore forcing people to upgrade if more than 3 stops are needed. What a hassle to limit to 3 stops on trip! That might work for weekend warriors but probably not for longer trips. In addition, there is NO way to save trips and notes as PDF. The only option is to log into website (not app) and PRINT to a printer. How many RVers travel with a printer? AND you may only pay the fee on the website, not through the app via Apple. That is so developer can avoid the fee Apple charges for in app subscriptions. Really disappointing. | They have made a change of trips with more than three stops. Have to be with a paid membership. I already had a long trip set up. When I went to modify that trip, it said I had to pay, but I couldn’t figure out how to pay. Extremely frustrated. | I like the app but most prices are outdated so it’s hard to make a decision when choosing affordable campgrounds. Otherwise nice app. Would be nicer if they added disperse and boondocks | Have used this app for years and love it!  Recently, it was locked down to 5 stops and now it’s locked down to 3 stops for non-members.  Ads have increased too. Checked the app for membership and costs and nothing to be found. This was a 5 star app and now a one star app.  Please reconsider this change!!! 3-5 stops is ridiculous for an RV’er. | I have been an RV Parky use her for a couple of years as I travel in an RV a lot. I have recommended RV parky to many people. Recently, my parky limits me to three stops and tells me I need to update my subscription to a paid account. I have no problem doing this however, there is no option on my account that allows me to update and pay, any suggestions on how to do this? | Please fix it so you can get in to the “review” section to leave a review even if the “name” of the location is extra long.   On places with a long name, you can’t scroll down enough to type or copy and paste into the review area.   Please fix!!   I try to leave reviews for every place but I’m hindered by this issue.  I’ve tried looking for an email address to send a screen print of the issue. | I have searched everywhere on how to pay for a membership. Nothing has it on any site. Can someone send me a link to it please. Thank you | I used to love this app but it appears someone has bought it and added restrictions and a bunch of ads. | I’ve had this app for several years, and it used to be a great app to research and plan RV trips! Recently they added ads (which is fine), but now have switched to locking down the app even further and hiding all the necessary features behind a pay wall.

I’m all for app developers making money through ads or premium subscriptions that grant you BONUS features, not lock down necessary features that are integral to using the app in the first place. 

Locking features like over 5 stops per trip to only be for paid users makes the app pretty much unusable for free (ad supporting) users. | Twice yesterday, app took us to low bridges. Had to unhook and turn around. Parameters are in. Unacceptable. | It was a good app but no more.  I read the reviews before thinking of upgrading. I get adding advertising to support the app infrastructure and develop(s). But now you are tracking all its user data too. Your approach to upgrading this app is callous to the faithfully dedicated users.  With that said goodbye. Apps are like fashion…they come and they go. | This is our “go to” navigation source for planning our trips. Hasn’t failed us yet! The one minor flaw is that it seems to be missing a lot of campgrounds—especially national and state parks—but over time, it seems like this is less and less true as more get added. We really rely on the reviews and links. Makes planning super easy! | I have been using RV Parking for years.  Today, I can’t update a current trip without “upgrading” my membership; code for pay for the app!  There is no mention of this upgrade anywhere when you update or anything!  How about a heads up and some consideration for those who have been recommending RV Parky to friends and RV Parks?  I am so disappointed and will need to consider a new planning app. | I’ve used this app for 3 years to plan RV trips. I was reviewing my upcoming trip and noticed an announcement in red at the top: “ Due to increased costs of running RV parky, trips are limited to 5 stops for non members.Upgrade acct via website. Members will have unlimited trips”. (paraphrased)
This must be new, within the last few weeks??  Curious if I will lose my trip since it’s always been free to use in the past? | RV Parky has been our primary tool on our iPhones and ipad to find overnight stops since what seems like forever. After updating the app last week, we have been inundated with pop up ads. What happened? Never had this before. The apps are now deleted from our phones | Being a full timer in the RV life, this was one of my most used apps. I can count on it for information on nearby, RV parks, Walmart, and other places where RVs can park. Now, since I updated, there are annoying ads that pop up on every campground that I look for information on. I have never, and will never, go running off to a store, and buy some thing that I see on a pop-up ad. They are intrusive and a total waste of money and time. Shame on you RV Parky for sticking these annoying ads in what was one of the best apps in the App Store. | Loved this app, have not used in 4 months. Now when I go into the map I can not tap on a camp ground and have a preview come up??? Have to go into a list and it lists the campgrounds in the area???? Do not like this at all😡 | I have used 5 other RVing apps, and only one compares favorably with RV Parky, and that one requires a yearly subscription. We are traveling with our 25’ travel trailer several months at a time now that we are retired, and RV Parky has been our primary “go to” app to plan and organize our trips. Thank you for an easy to use yet sophisticated RVing app. | What have you gone and done with the app? I can’t even get things to pull up, it’s so unresponsive to my fingers touching on sites and the map in general. It used to work great. I could lightly touch a tiny sign on the map and it would open it even when I couldn’t see the site. Now, even repeatedly over and over touching on a place won’t open, won’t do anything. And the map itself won’t stretch out half the time, pretty much  ignores basically anything my hands do. I’m so disappointed, I use this as I travel all over. I’m on an iPhone. Please try to get your iPhone app system so it works again. :( I’m so grouchy about this. | Lots of great features not offered by my other RV apps. This one is very different. Can often find RV parks not in the other apps. To be able to find places to stay along a predetermined route is a plus. Hope this one doesn't go away! | I seriously love this app. My husband and I are RV travelers, and spent a couple of years traveling through all 50 states and all but the two northern-most Canadian provinces and territories. I plan our trips with this app. I don’t mind adding in sightseeing stops or RV campgrounds I find elsewhere via addresses. 

I do, however, mind that the map is not locked with north at the top of the screen. I use the app in my iPhone and iPad, and it’s frustrating that the slightest touch sends the map spinning. It’s a glitch that irritates me every time I use the app, and with over 45K miles under our tires, I use it all the time! Can this be fixed?  

Also, can National Parks with campgrounds be added? They appear on the map, but are not hyperlinked to add to the list of stops. | Keep going back to RV Trip Wizard because of 2 very annoying misses with this app. 1) Can't search for parks by name. You have to find the city, search for the city and then find the campground in a list or on the map. 2) When creating a trip you cannot lock the dates when planning campsites so if you reserve site for a set of dates the dates keep moving around when you can any other date, change the start date or even add other stops. As much as we recommend this on our channel, @VanTrekkingLifestyle, we just can't recommend it any longer with these key omissions that make planning even harder than just doing it on a calendar.  It's close to being perfect.  Why not add the features even if there's a fee to get them? | This app is an essential tool when traveling. | I traveled 3 months, 10,000 USA miles using this app to plan my stops for sleeping. Walmart and Cracker Barrrels all the way in my 24’ class C. I’d be lost without it. The reviews were invaluable. | The reviews are helpful but trip planning with this is too much. Tap in a field to type and no keyboard appears iPhone 11 | Many of the reviews on the app are at least a year old. I’ve been able to submit two reviews but I can’t submit any more on my iPhone. I have been able to submit on my computer but that isn’t convenient. It would be great if this was fixed and the reviews were more convenient.
Otherwise, the app has been very easy to use and helpful in planning our route. | Started rving in 2018 and downloaded this app from a recommendation. It was good for us  new comers with no experience. But 4 years later its really old reviews and out of date information it has become untrustworthy. Reviews from 5 years ago do not help. The system is easy to use, that’s why I keep the app, but I would use it more if the old info was deleted. Sounds like a refresh is needed. | This app is very helpful planning trips. Just be aware that this app or any of the other camping apps don’t have all the campground listed. Some of the website links for booking are outdated or broken. While the app works well for the most part, it could use some updating or refreshing. | After the latest update you can’t type in a location in the “add a stop” dialog box on iOS. | Update really messed things up on my phone.

(50$ instead of 75$) They have a non refundable 15$ service fee, be aware! Take your time before booking and look around on other sites/apps! | Very easy to see different train options and times. | This app was wonderful to easily make my plans for my upcoming trip. The only issue I ran into was the app would not accept my 2 VISA credit cards the first 4 times I tried!  But hang in there….the fifth time was the charm. | A smooth and satisfying experience.  Thank-you. | Service fees are as much as the ticket. | I paid $69 for a train ticket and when I got the ticket it said the cost of the ticket was $28.50! They also put me on a different train than I requested which extended the journey by 2 hours on a route that was much less scenic! I reached out to customer service and they told me “ the price I paid included a markup, and premiums on top of the original ticket price, which includes fees, credit card fees, exchange fees, and ticketing service fees. If I would have bought the ticket through the official app I would have been able to buy 3 tickets for the same price! This company is a total ripoff and I highly recommend people double check all their options before buying tickets! | Used the app on our latest trip to Italy to book trains to and from Rome and Naples. This part worked perfectly but we also booked rail from Rome to FCO airport which has not worked so well. Ninja booked the tickets to the airport but the tickets we download from their APP indicated the that leg of the is not a legal ticket to use on the train and we have to go to a different vendors app to get the actual ticket. The problem is that the Trenitalia app (and their website) does not recognize the ninja ticket code as being in the system. The number ninja provide for Trenitalia is 6 digits and we could not figure out how to call that number for help. I wrote Ninja customer service asking for help and I submitted a customer case, but after 4 days we still had not heard any thing back from Rail Ninja customer support. We ended up going to to the Trenitalia office at the local train station and after about an hour of investigations they agreed we paid for a ticket but could not find it in their system. We now have hand written tickets to go from Rome to FCO airport. But no real guarantee that they work for us on Easter Sunday. A little Customer Service on Rail Ninja would have gone a long way to help make this a relaxing vacation. So I really can’t recommend this app for that reason. It’s easy to use and seems to work, mostly, but if something doesn’t work they don’t easy to stand behind their product. | Good stuff | couldn’t download QR code.  then i found ticket prices on two other travel apps for $65.00. less | Do not use this app!
It is sponsored on google because they upcharge all tickets by 50% and price gouge Americans not familiar with European train systems. 
Go directly to the rail site and book there. 
I saved 50% off my norway tickets by cancelling my railninja ones and booking directly thru the rail site EVEN AFTER INCURRING the ridiculous rail ninja cancellation fees. 
If you try and cancel they only refund 80%. | l decided to use Rail Ninja back on 11/30/23 to use a central ticket purchasing platform for my colleagues and I only to get nothing but headaches!

According to Rail Ninja website they are a premier ""the easiest way to book train tickets"", which has NOT been the case!

11/30/2023 Tickets purchased. Which was DOUBLE what the carrier charges. But i was ok with it, if, it was a premier service.

Tickets would not scan, according to carrier I would need to contact rail ninja in order to resolve. My colleague had to repurchase tickets from carrier.

12/01/23 Case Opened (Within couple hours from purchasing)

12/11/23 Responded to the same question.

GAVE RAIL NINJA more than two months and still I am waiting.

01/15/24 1 had to reach out for an update. only to be told i have to wait for the carrier. I did not buy from the carrier, i bought from Rail Ninja.

01/30/24 Still waiting to hear from Rail Ninja

At this point, Rail Ninja is nothing more than a reseller with no added advantages and get nothing but headaches, time wasting and loss of money!

This is a SCAM! | will be reaching out to BBB to open a dispute and have come to terms that this company stole my money.

DO NOT USE! Buy direct from the carrier and avoid these scammers! | So useful | I decided to use Rail Ninja back on 11/30/23 to use a central ticket purchasing platform for my colleagues and I only to get nothing but headaches!

DO NOT USE! | Fast easy | Awesome service . Very helpful | The biggest issue is if there are changes or cancellations to the trip that are out of your control. For example, our train tickets were not
usable due to the strike in Portugal and we’ve been waiting for over six months now to get a reimbursement from Rail Ninja. | If you buy tickets through RailNinja you’re literally going to pay over 50% more for no reason. I cancelled my tickets and bought the same ones directly through the actual rail company’s website. I was disgusted when I saw how much cheaper it was. The worst part is if you make the same mistake I did and try to cancel tickets bought through RailNinja, they only refund you 80% of the price you paid. Whoever runs this company is pathetic and should be ashamed of themselves. What a dishonest way to make a living, do you not have shame? Absolutely horrible company that I hope does not survive to do this to people anymore. | The tickets are not real and charge 2x. Do not use this scam company | Keep using the company for many years and now it is even more convenient since they have an app. Very easy to navigate and book 👌 | We arrived at the train station and were told that the tickets we booked using this app were not valid and that we had been scammed. 
The price this app charged us for the tickets was also 2X the actual price we paid at the station. 
Upon looking up more about “Rail Ninja” it appears many others have shared their horror stories with this app and its website online.
Thank god the train I needed wasn’t fully booked or this app would’ve had me stuck in an unfamiliar city in a foreign country. | Bought tickets for Shinkansen and JR lines said my QR code was not good.

Simple, elegant screen and useful controls, you can configure the main screen a little bit,  great maps offline, layers and overlays depending on your current activity, and you can navigate main roads and trails…
Very close to be perfect….
Now I can throw away my garming and have all on my phone | Worldwide downable maps, offline functionality and quick tech support. Easy and intuitive to use. The too-fast-talking issue was an iOS problem resolved by going to Settings->Accessibility->Spoken Content and adjusting the Speaking Rate slider. So impressed that I gladly paid for the pro license. | I’ve been using Guru maps for a couple years now. I got the lifetime pro license to use on both my iPad and my Android phone. I love the app on both platforms. 
  I really like how you can download entire maps databases for different states in the US and also different countries around the world. I travel internationally for work quite a bit and this is very helpful in being able to download a map database and have detailed maps available in full functionality when offline. Yes, Google maps allows you to download some areas but you don’t get any functionality with it like directions for any type of navigation and it just doesn’t get the details of the downloaded area like this does. 

Bottom line- worth every penny for the pro license and I absolutely love the app. If you appreciate a good maps app, and all sorts of functions with it, this one’s for you! | While I have not used this app much, there is one big deal breaker when I used it for navigation. It is as if voice navigation directions are speeded up 5x! Unless that is fixed, IMO, it is bot usable as is. | Excellent map app. Especially like the downloaded maps. Have used it to fly along roads in the mountains in a Cessna where cellular is spotty. Fast response on tech service questions. | I’m on a cruise ship and wanted to track our route, so this is working pretty well. 

I wonder if you buy it for iPhone do you have to buy it again for iPad? | I installed the app and to try it out I tried to navigate to a location near my house. It seems to work but the voice that reads out the turn by turn instructions plays at extremely high speed (I would guess 10x normal) so it is impossible to understand it. This is with iOS v16.1.1, on an iPhone 12 mini. | The ability to access maps and GPS navigation is great here in New Mexico, where cell service is nil away from urban areas. | It’s no way to figure out how to use navigation or driving directions, just wasted my time. | Great app. The functionality without internet or cell service was exceptional on a recent visit to Baja California. Looking forward to using it on my next adventure here in the states now. | Guru maps has replaced my stand alone GPS unit for hiking and hunting. This is a well written and very useful app. Thanks. | This app is awesome especially with the fact that u can use it offline once the map is downloaded for ur country. Pls keep improving it cos it helps with getting coordinates airborne especially for operations. | The app does not register as accurately and quickly the direction I’m moving or the direction I’m aiming the phone. This is an issue when trying to smoothly navigate in the city. The app also has issues with recognising street addresses or names of locations. As a paid use of Guru, I still end up having to use Google maps. | With the ability to download offline maps and the recent addition of topographic data, this is the best map app for my uses. | Just learning how to use Guru Maps. Enormous potential! Applying it to aerial survey of protected areas in Africa. Looking forward to mastering it in aid of Biodiversity Conservation. | I’ve been using Guru maps for many years in multiple countries including Mongolia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Australia and the USA. 

The maps are accurate, the downloaded versions are quick and snappy in areas where WiFi and cellular are hard to come by. 

The developer is awesome! We get new features all the time, customer service is great, and updates for each OS come quickly after apple releases any updates. 

This is a map app for pros. | Used the app for backpacking for several days. Super easy to download offline maps and it provides excellent offline navigation both for driving and walking. It even provides excellent terrain information for walking directions, showing the expected elevation changes which was super helpful. | I use it frequently on my daily walks and trade images of my route with my daughter in CA. We also enjoy sharing flowers and nature photos we see along our route. 
It uses NO Cellular Data and doesn’t track us | Please add an option to display the mountain peaks in feet. Currently they are only in meters. | I have used Guru maps for year. (Before they renamed it).
I love the route tracking. We travel a lot and it is great documentation for where and when we have been. I also use it on bike trips that we take from time to time. So I have markers and route tracking from all over.  
I use it on bike t | If your looking for an offline map, this is it! | The best app I have found for hiking directions in the SF Bay Area. The app is awesome. | This is my go-to app for anything that Google or Apple Maps can’t handle. With selectable map sources, downloadable vector maps, decent navigation, and rock solid track recording, it does everything I need. It even works offline with a little preparation. | I used this a few years ago when it was Galileo. I downloaded maps for 5 US states. The UI is confusing but you get used to it, so everyone I showed this to I would explain the UI so that they’d understand what it does. The map design is not as nice as other mapping apps but this app works offline, so I used it occasionally when I was out of signal range.

Since then, Galileo/Guru has changed their pricing from one time to subscription, and other apps have added offline use. HERE Maps has unlimited downloads, a simpler UI, and better map design; Google Maps has limited downloads but a nicer UI and more data on the maps.

I stopped using Galileo/Guru when I had to restore my phone from backup. It lost the maps it had already downloaded and wouldn’t let me download them again without payment. I understand why they raised their prices but it made me think about why I didn’t use it much (map design, ui, features), and led me to delete it. I don’t want to be reminded every month that I’m paying for something I only use occasionally; I only subscribe to things I use often.

It’s the right app for some people so *it’s worth a try* but it wasn’t worth the higher price for me so I’ve removed it and no longer show it to my colleagues. | Used guru in the states, Israel and Peru so far. Best way to travel. Easy and accurate. | Love this app.  Would get 6 stars if it had support for Apple CarPlay. | The free version only allows you to trace 15 trails. Also, I haven’t figured out how to map individual waypoints. | I received the developer’s response: 

“We develop app. Map data in our app belongs to OpenStreetMap project. It’s open map project and anyone could edit it. No Russia is involved in mapping. It’s more like a consequences of their foreign affairs.""

Dear Evgen B. - thank you for your response. Maybe you should look into alternative OpenMap projects? Had internet existed during WW2 half of Europe would still be showing up as Germany or the III Reich. Today’s leadership of russia is just as aggressive as the leadership of yesterday’s nazi Germany. To say your map depiction is “a consequence of their (russia’s) foreign affairs” is equivalent to you rewarding their internationally condemned acts of aggression. The current führer of russia will be gone one day and you shouldn’t be rewarding his unlawful actions. 
Thank you.

Like the app in general but I dislike the fact it rearranges some of the world borders based on the views of the kremlin tyrant. Several ‘countries’ (abkhasia??, transnistria?? LOL) it depicts do not exist but are rather territories occupied by the russian autocracy. The same applies to Crimea which, according to 99.99% of the world’s population, rightfully belongs to Ukraine. | My family and I were trying to find a house in a remote area and our GPS on our phones couldn’t reach service where we were. Not to mention we wouldn’t be able to find our way back home. Luckily, a year ago, I decided to download this Guru map offline app and to my surprise, it worked offline like It said it would. So this is diffidently an app worth keeping. As well as a real map. Lol | Lots a better and free options.  Not sure how they expect to survive with the new subscription model | Love that it is free and shows terrain for all my trad climbing routes in Yosemite Valley. I can record the gps trail map, save pins for not so well marked climber trails. Have been using this app for over 5 yrs! | One thing that I have found that I dislike about the app is the search function. Let’s say I open the app and conduct a search. It finds my results, and if I select a result, a new panel appears on the right side of the screen that shows the update map. I cannot seem to merge the search results into the main screen. I do not want a small sliver of screen. If I search for a location, chances are I want the map to be centered on my selected search result. Full screen, big map. No small windows or split screens. Horrible aggravating implementation of search. | Wonderfully useful as visitors from the USA | Para no perderte con o sin conexión, para que nuestro destino esté al alcance de nuestra mano. | The best navigation app I have ever used. I really love it | Galileo is very polished and packed with features. I have used this to get around my own town online as well as other countries without cell service with great success.

The map quality for Open Street Maps is not as good as Google or Apple maps in my city, but the great part is i can fix errors in minutes instead of “reporting a problem” with the map and waiting months for it to be fixed. | Too buggy, especially if try your so called offline mode. And remember, putlerlover, that Crimea is not Russia, it is Ukraine. | Some might call me obsessed with maps especially when traveling!  Galileo is a great tool for planning trips as well as recording tracks of where you've been in great detail. I have constantly found new ways of utilizing this app. | اتمنى ان يدعم اللغة العربية بأسرع وقت | Like the import KML feature | I love this app. I've used it for motorcycle navigation and hiking. It couldn't be easier to import a route and the map download sizes are much smaller than other apps. And now you can view Google maps in the app with a data connection. Buy this now. | The Best!!!!!!
Lo mejor es que es offline y me a servido de mucho. | One of the best offline apps I have found. Have been using it for several years without problems. Nothing short of great. | You pay 4$ and you are done - you have all the maps of the world, including trail maps, in front of you. No need to use data. Simply download the map of the state or country you are going to before your trip and you are done! 
Several benefits:
1. You can store your points of interest on the map forever. Your friend recommended you a nice restaurant? You have discovered new location you want to remember?  Everything is easy to store for use in future. 
2. You can store all your routes' treks and see what was your speed and altitude profile. Very useful for keeping track of your trips.
3. You could easily import maps of your friends or your maps from google maps in gpx format. 
Conclusiong: I have been recommending to all my friends who travel and they love it! Simply the best! | Check the map for mistakes. Crimea is Ukraine not russia | This is such a great tool to have!  Being able to locate trails wherever you find yourself is a significant benefit.  Very much worth the price! | I've had this app for several years now and it always amazes me. I just loaded 26000 campground waypoints for the US. All one needs is files in gpx format. I have many different waypoint file loaded. The small vector maps for states/countries are awesome and quite detailed. | Better than google maps. | The best offline app for navigation and tracking! I tried other apps, this one is my favorite. | Works well so far. Still learning the app.",4.67917,826,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/d2/ea/83/d2ea839b-329b-29ec-26ab-bed66056581b/e56e2f8c-4f98-4d09-93da-0b5a6f390f8b_iPhone_8_Plus_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b8/c4/c1/b8c4c16c-35a3-90cb-1867-d5c676d51c24/cf0905cf-e847-4603-84cd-506553e3d9b6_iPhone_8_Plus_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f4/7e/ac/f47eac88-d051-a526-3e85-6eb7bfedb829/57487725-f3d3-4604-97fd-b7155161dcb0_iPhone_8_Plus_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3d/6c/fe/3d6cfe7c-8053-6b1b-2a9d-b7a0e272a854/6e2c5db7-5769-423b-8f2a-ad4f20164836_iPhone_8_Plus_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/18/93/2b/18932b16-6803-d156-407d-14a182b7252a/780d40e9-448d-45c2-9597-f7bb39e8b2f3_iPhone_8_Plus_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d5/f5/0a/d5f50ad5-8333-9417-7232-298b642613c2/36654503-2450-43d7-9bbc-e3040029796b_iPhone_8_Plus_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d4/da/6b/d4da6b62-0709-130b-607d-1670975d2c90/307ac260-1dc2-4fd2-b147-a533ea47ce32_iPhone_8_Plus_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f8/b1/81/f8b18134-472c-06f4-77da-eb87942ca1ff/a1516c59-1d06-41ac-a183-30e6f357acd6_iPhone_8_Plus_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/fd/ed/17/fded1779-b3ab-f490-b37d-4ec309daa378/d4c7e5af-60cc-482e-bf31-ff933c930dfd_iPhone_8_Plus_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/8c/0e/b0/8c0eb02f-50e2-0c97-47c0-c7e2d46a0098/eafc40af-e472-4e1b-a274-de1840ae3148_ipadPro129_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6e/75/44/6e7544d6-c57a-205f-a2d9-e246fcab7cfb/1141ac94-555d-49cf-816e-703805a2a720_ipadPro129_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f6/be/02/f6be02f2-bf8c-63b8-a7a0-3ec0ae42a174/e031da53-464f-470b-bcc2-33392966a4ae_ipadPro129_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b5/f1/84/b5f1842c-0b56-2c50-ee9e-d6fc9b3ce880/2801abae-70dd-48d2-a08c-e2436a2e591e_ipadPro129_4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/99/8f/48/998f483b-0744-65ec-0ff5-3d0cab5bf92c/4de38961-a81f-4d94-9eaf-f3032c217b39_ipadPro129_5.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f5/d0/17/f5d0172e-3a08-3d99-4b73-958d0c944868/3c767a13-61f9-4fa7-a8e0-174424f4f6aa_ipadPro129_6.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/63/f2/56/63f2560d-218f-36a2-abae-a138c4398465/645d26f5-626d-4885-9931-f1d88942a50c_ipadPro129_7.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/62/6f/e4/626fe4b6-6227-64df-e181-0e006b95293c/d17e7301-756f-40df-9849-8963b757551d_ipadPro129_8.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/70/44/39/7044396d-8bda-fd9b-9b57-fcbc810847bc/97f1c5c4-5390-4626-ac09-93ec086d1aac_ipadPro129_9.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhon

Lumen Trails Daily Tracker lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car! Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. 

“I've been using Daily Tracker for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza

The beauty of Daily Tracker is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits, or even net worth? Daily Tracker is the app for that!

Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. You'll have all your important data stored in one convenient place, for many years to come.

Designed exclusively for the iPhone and iPad, Daily Tracker is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 12 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Drive.

So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? 

Track it and get things done!

The terminology of ""categories"" is a bit confusing, but once you accept how it works, you can do a lot of things with it.  Some things will be more useful to you than others, but that is its flexibility.  I keep track of my medications. I keep health notes in the daily journal.  I keep track of what I eat in the food diary.  It is simple because you can just take a picture of your meal.  I keep track of my various exercising. I love the resulting graphs to track progress. | This seems like a nice app. But I’m picky. Particularly when it comes to paywalls.
It is my opinion that in part of the advertising for an app, it should tell you that after your seven day trial you will have to pay. If you don’t put it in the pictures on the App Store, at least have a passing comment about it in the description.

Yes, this app is a great idea. Yes, I would like to use it.
Yes, I would rather have 5 different apps on my phone than use this one app for ⭐️$49.99/year⭐️.
It would be fantastic if I could use this app in a limited fashion, and if I wanted full access then I pay for “pro”. But that’s not the current situation.
I understand money isn’t a problem for some people. I understand I’m probably being a bit stingy. But my policy for apps is that I don’t pay for them when it’s recurring payments.
Y’all do what you will, I wish you the best. | The app includes a lot of templates but it’s missing a spreadsheet like template.
Can you add a spreadsheet like template? | The app is very good however I am looking for another app that the font can be increased or decreased. Because of the this issue, I would not recommend this application. | I keep track of bills, my budget, medication, daily actions, diary, etc. I keep track of everything and it has lists and alarms, anything you could want to do and list things anyway you want them listed. I have completely organized many things but still have more things to set up. It is so flexible and awesome.

Many years later, I have tried other apps but this is by far the one I have always been able to track things, make lists, log my time throughout the day. | This is my first review ever, that’s how much I love it. I downloaded 5 different apps until I found this one. I own my own business and this app has been invaluable. 
There are only 2 things I’d like to see added/ changed w/ the To Do List. 
*Leave the completed items with the date. Rather than them being under “Earlier” use the actual date. 
*can the recurring items be separated for each date. I have tasks that I do each day/week/month and take notes on each. But those same notes show up when the task comes up again. | I’ve loved this app for years. But recently I’ve noticed that some time the sentences I wrote disappeared afterward (not saved or sync). Can you fix the bug so it won’t happen again? | Downloaded this app that is listed as free with in app purchases.  It will not let me get past the opening screen that requires either an immediate purchase OR restoration of prior purchase.

Zero free about using this app. I will not try your trial because this is bad faith listing the product as free in Apple App Store to start with.

Do not download, do not use and do not give this company your business given their misleading marketing practices. | Scammed me 50$ do not purchase. | Is there a way to log items using Apple Shortcuts? I want to log a value on the day I click the shortcut. | Downloaded but took me to the updated version. Please refund both app charged. | These developers are legit!
I started this app 12 years ago, on my iPhone 4S! It cleared so much clutter out of my head and kept every kind of list known to man.
Then went through major life changes, had zero room on phone and stopped using productivity apps.
I noticed this offloaded on my phone and just assumed it probably didn’t exist anymore because everything is a subscription these days.
But I opened it, it was fresh, completely updated, no ads, not bothering me for money and ALL my lists from a decade ago are still there!
It seems to cover what I now use several apps to do!
It has a hierarchical filing system.
Hello you!
I remember you ♥️ | I’ve been using this app for a few months to track my Total Gym workouts, my weight, fasting record, and a whole bunch of home and work projects. Maybe there could be some better options for creating custom data entry forms, but this is the best one-size-fits-all app that I have found. It seamlessly and automatically syncs between my iPhone and iPad. You are probably going to find that this app has more capabilities than first meets the eye. The applications for this app are limitless! I’ve got to say I love it and highly recommend it. | please add the ability view multiple years of data at a time!! this will allow users to see more progress at once, and make the graph data easier to read.  Currently when I track my weight, if 180 is the lowest in a year it's the shortest bar, then if I start the next year at 178 then 175, the 178 bar is at the top of the chart, visually higher than 180 from the previous year. (or allow users to set max/min values for a graph so the bar height is consistent if clicking through year to year)

with weight loss apps this is standard and MUCH more useful for looking at lots of data over time. Recently i haven’t been using Lumen Trails much or recommending it to friends because of this. 

 And if there was a more robust way to compare different graphs that'd be awesome! so I could easily see the relationship between my eating/exercise/weight/etc. 

thanks! | Very handy to keep important numbers.  I use this app many times a week. | I’m used for many year and never have problem very security | Exquisite DIY tracking platform. Been using it for 8 years without a hitch! Thank you! | I’m starting my third year using this app and it’s the best one out there. Numerous ways to work your schedule with it. I’d give it 5 stars except for a couple of quirks - some things that should take 1 step take 3, there is no way to un-delete if you make a mistake, and there’s no way to keep my docs in the order I want them | This app has truly been a lifesaver,  by tracking my medication and the effects that I began to notice helped my doctor to see what was happening and I was taken off of the medication before it caused too much more harm to my health. I will always be Thankful for this app, I can track everything that is important to me Thank You for a Great App it’s more than just a tracker I have had this app since my first iPhone. | Seriously-Best ever!  I love keeping score with myself. Track all my virtues and mistakes here! Straight up 10. | My go to app for daily organization. | I can no longer edit entries in the ap.  Why?  I used to be able to add onto an entry and this capability has been removed.  Please bring it back. | I love this app but the latest updates have made the look messy and unfriendly. I don't want to see every day of the week, if there is nothing in that day. Plus, you can’t sort ascending order in sort by date anymore. It puts the soonest dates at the bottom. BRING BACK GROUP BY DATE please. 

 I can only hope enough people complain and another update is rolled out. Thanks. | And it’s always being improved. Powerful, versatile and easy to operate. | Loved it from the very start.  It’s still my most versatile app on my phone. Keeps track of all my thoughts, plans, lists and projects! | These apps used to be great, now they're overpriced and false advertising. 

That's too bad. | This app allows me to keep a bunch of different lists in an easy to organize way. Plus I love how the hidden and locked notes themselves are hidden. Unless someone is familiar with the app, they wouldn’t even know that more now there. | I have enjoyed using this app for years. It does what it is designed to do, whether for notes, daily diary, food log or whatever. It is reliable which is the most important thing. | I’ve had this app on my iDevices for over a decade. It’s like a Swiss Army knife, one flexible and easily configured app that does lots of useful stuff. | Multi-function and always there. Really appreciate the security. | I use this for journaling and keeping track of everything!    I would be lost without it.    It is so functional and can be used for so many things. | I’ve never written an app review before but felt compelled to thank the creators for this app. I can track anything I want and get daily monthly and yearly totals to see progress. I haven’t found any other app that compares. This has helped me so much with sticking to habits, getting things done and motivation overall. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope this app lasts as long as I do, it’s a game changer for me! Definitely worth the $40 a year. | I just downloaded this, so I can’t give a full review yet. But one thing I can speak to is the false accusation that users are being bilked out of 40 bucks without any free use of the app.  True, you are asked to approve a charge order for a yearly subscription, costing $39.99, posted to your iTunes account.  But, there is a clear statement that you have 30 days before the charge is actually debited to your account, with a specific day given when that will happen. Canceling the subscription any time BEFORE that day will prevent the debit.  I have implemented cancellations of this sort numerous times without incident, most notably for monthly subscriptions to streaming services like Disney+ or Acorn.  An opt-out arrangement is perfectly reasonable and a common business practice, although it does require you to set a reminder for the end of the trial period if you want the option of cancellation.  I can recommend an app to do that, by some outfit in Seattle WA (can’t remember their name …). | I’ve been using this app for a few years on and off, and paying for it back then has been more than worth it now many times over. I love that it is not gimmicky and it’s so widely and easily applicable to so many different kinds of tasks. It doesn’t take long to learn it, and once you do, it is simple but powerful. 
I admit, from time to time I search for some other new daily tracker app to get something new, different, and exciting. Sometimes I’ll try one, sometimes I’ll even pay a few bucks for one that looks good. Maybe I use it for a little while. But every time I keep coming back to this one. It’s just better than any other tracker. I mean, I guess if you have some specific thing that you want to track in a particular way, or you want fancier graphics or motivations, maybe there is a better app that’s built just for you and that thing, but otherwise just go with Lumen. | I got a screen where I could subscribe. That’s it. It says there’s a free trial, but I haven’t even seen anything. I immediately deleted it. Oh well. | I used to used this app and then they made a new subscription model and locked me out of my own data. VERY unscrupulous company. Would recommend not touching this app with a ten foot pole. Sorry I have to give it 1 star | Deceptive advertising | I can see why Lumen Tracker is so popular with the people who use it.  It is a simple tool with an easy-to-grasp organizational structure, yet features that enable powerful capabilities for tracking and analyzing information.  The app is immediately useful without learning anything about the features, though. | Great app for everything. I keep track of my jobs time and material. I use it for camping checklists 
You can use it for almost everything. | In app purchase is only if you want to use the app. [eye-roll emoji]
Listing implies everything but one feature (something about trails) is free, but in reality you have to sign up for annual $40 fee to use it at all. Sorry, that’s deceptive, expensive, and you wasted my time. | I first got these apps about 5 years ago. I really like the flexibility of the tool. I ended up just using one for everything because it was easier to manage. Then they released this all in one, and I was excited. So glad I kept my old apps!!! You can’t even try the new one without starting a 30 day trial that ends in a yearly charge of $40!  It’s not even close to that good. Not. Even. Close. I can’t see any value in subscribing at all. I would pay $12 for each significant new release. That’s it. | Needs Larger Bold Font.Everything else is great. | As a user of their old app, the developers decided to redirect all their old apps to this app but not before forcing you to pay for access to your old notes even though it was free before.

All my notes are locked behind a paywall after updating the old app! Literally turned the app to ransomware. AVOID! Shall complain to Apple. | This is the most useful app you can buy!
I have been using this app since it was first available. At the beginning it was a free app, like most were, but it is now a subscription. Which is ok, after all business need to make a profit.

This is still the most useful app you can buy!  I have none better than this one. You can track anything you can think of.

GREAT APP!

George | Guys I love this app, I’ve used it for years to track sooo many things, organize to do lists, it’s amazing! And I love MOST of the most recent update. But please give us back the option to keep a bubble “clear” — color coding is an important way I organize within the app and I don’t want color in every single thing — also, it would be amazing if we had even a few options about text within notes — like bold/italic/underline — thanks! | I’ve appreciated this app for a very long time, and I gather I’m not alone in that. The developers have been careful to remain faithful to the unique design, and they have tweaked the app periodically to incorporate improvements made possible by new versions of iOS. Many thanks to the developers. | Bring back the time/date slider. The current change means I have to enter the time blind — I can’t see the time dialogue, just the keypad. Very bad design! | I resent that the app is not straight forward. I downloaded it and then it pops up demanding payment to continue. Be honest and list the price, don’t waste my time downloading, pretending it’s free. | This app has grand ability to assist in clarifying what is actually happening in someone’s life. By simplifying the process of recording events big or small, at the user’s discretion, it gets employed more often by this user than anything similar in the universe of apps. Would love to see a Mac app that would allow for the entry of data and syncing across Mac, iPhone and iPad.October 20, 2020 after many years of using to my benefit daily tracker I would love to see the additional capacity to be able to send documents to the daily journal from other applications kind of likeEvernote allows me to forwardEmail messages to my notebook.

789934914,"com.Badger.badger","Badger Maps: #1 Route Planner","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/badger-maps-1-route-planner/id789934914?uo=4","Badger Maps is an all-in-one field sales app that helps outside sales professionals increase revenue and save time by automating busywork. 

Founded in 2012, Badger solves a longstanding field sales problem: juggling a map, a calendar, a schedule, and client data — all while dealing with traffic and spending hours behind the wheel, struggling to arrive to appointments on time. 

Badger is designed with all the needs of field salespeople in mind. It takes care of all of their challenges with multiple features: route optimization (with 100+ stops), lead generation, interactive client data visualization (import your spreadsheet or sync Badger with your CRM), meeting notes logging, field activity reports, and more! 

With Badger, a field sales rep has 10 more meetings a week, saves 3 hours behind the wheel, and cuts time spent on frustrating admin work by half. 

Additionally, field sales managers can get insights on their reps’ performance in the field, manage territories more easily, boost CRM adoption, plan their reps’ accounts and routes, and tackle any problems in the team before they even arise.  

Here’s the monthly ROI you can get with Badger:

• 22% more sales
• 20% fewer miles 
• 32 hours less planning and scheduling
• And 40 extra meetings 

One of our customers, NCR Aloha, a POS software provider, grew sales by 20% monthly and reduced drive and planning time by 25% daily and 50% weekly, respectively. 

Cutter & Buck, a sportswear company, obtained 8 extra meetings weekly per rep and grew annual revenue by 22%. 

Here’s what our customers are saying: 

“Our efficiency has easily increased over 100% since we’ve implemented Badger Maps. Each rep is seeing at least 2 more accounts and finding 2 more prospecting opportunities per day.”

— Ken Buck, Regional Sales Manager, Danaher

“With Badger, I averaged 25% more in sales in the last year. I also cut my driving by a huge amount, no more zig-zagging all over town.”

— Lara Thomas, Sales Rep, DermaTran

“Badger contributed heavily to our bottom line. Reps consistently met our goal of 10 meetings a day, 50 per week. That wouldn’t have been possible without Badger.”

— Rich Becker, Grad Solutions, Arizona Director of Business Development

Below is an overview of the features we offer (feel free to visit our website for more details).

I can plan routes, check in and schedule follow ups. I highly recommend. | And that is good thing!

This app saved me time, made me money and provided an ideal way to keep track of my store visits and pictures. 

 I started with the free trial, and leaned on their support team to get started. Its pretty intuitive and easy to work with, especially with their 24/7 superior ongoing support (phone, chat or email).  I now have the paid single user license (month to month and very reasonably priced) as that’s all I need for now. They also have team and enterprise packages as well if you have more users. 

They also respond quickly on all support platforms, including email (same day, and many times, same hour!). 

If you need to do any route sales, service or other account check-ins on a regular basis, or manage a team that does, give the Badger team a try. You’ll see just how “Bad@$$” you can truly be in your job! | Your can’t set follow up appointments thru the app | I have been using this app for a little over a year and love what this app brings to the table.  Definitely assists me in be most efficient in travel time to different customers.  It also helps me to stay organized with all the note keeping that I do for all visits and discussion topics while at visit!  After using this app I feel that it has a tremendous impact on my already tights schedule.  If your not using it you definitely should! | Unfortunately, once you set up an account, it’s a nightmare to cancel your monthly subscription. I was charged for 2 month after cancellation through the App Store. The excuse I got was they use their own billing. Check your cc statement after you cancel and get a confirmation email your account is canceled. | Couldn’t imagine leading a team of Outside Sales Representatives without Badger. Easy planning, all account info at your fingertips, and  can be incorporated into your CRM so no double notes. | Started w/ 1 user, up to additional 7 members of my team on Badger. My CSA - Zach Jennings - is a rockstar!! 🤩 APPRECIATE YOU Z 👊🔥 | It has wonderful features, but doesn’t always work the way you want it to. Their team is helpful and responsive should you need the help. I wish I had a way to view multiple routes at one time to compare. Overall, decent application on phone and desktop. | Never use this company. 

We have a dealership for solar, we were exploring companies /tech to use for our field reps. I personally decided to download badger, try their system out and realized quickly it wasn’t something we would use and canceled the free trial. 

30 days later I’m charged $60 for their subscription. Apple won’t refund me after two attempts and badger has zero support. 

Stay away | I entered a list of accounts sequentially by number. The app cut the list in half, reversed the order, then labled all the locations on the map in the reversed order. When I tried to follow a route it was a mess. There was no reference association between the numbers which the app labeled my locations and what I had named them. So I see on the map that I need to go to location #38 but when I get there it is actually about #20 in the way I entered it. Then when I wanted to see who this appointment was the app did not write the label they made beside the account I entered so I had no idea who this account was. Very frustrating. This is glitchy to the point of  costing me more time than if I had sat at a desk in my office and just manually mapped my own routes. I am sorry to have to report this. I left a message with customer service. My need for a mapping app is great. This one is not there yet. I hope they upgrade this soon so I can write a praiseworthy review. | I’ve been using Badger Maps for over 8 years and it’s an essential tool for making the rounds and ensuring that I have not left out any customers or notes for future visits. The reports are provided by email weekly and monthly for review as well. Great addition to my toolbox and don’t know what I would do without it. | Found and got started inputting data last night. Had trouble getting todays route uploaded. Emailed support figured they would get to it today sometime. Joanna emailed right back and got started and was ready this morning when I got up to start my day. Made my day. Then found this App to boot. Solid! | Had my username and password saved in Apple key chain and one day went to log in and was locked out. Did a password change and still couldn’t get into the app. Checked my credit card to make sure I was still being billed and of course I was… I contacted customer service through email because they don’t have a number listed so you can call of course. They claimed I was on a free trial??? Nope I was just billed so I went into Apple Subscriptions and cancelled. Problem solved even though I was still payed up for the rest of the month. Never again | I have been using Badger maps for the last 5 months. However, I have several observations that may make Badger even more useful for field personnel. 
I would like to be able to create follow up calls and meetings from the phone. Right now, it is a cumbersome way to get it into your schedule 
Badger should have connectivity with Outlook, so as to have yet another reminder to complete more tasks. 
I like the visualization feature but it needs refinement. Another words, make it so that when you have checked in it then creates an immediate follow up date inherently. Also there needs to be a way to just visualize customers that have not been or need to be visited once again. Otherwise, I think Badger is a great app, easy to manipulate and it helps with remembering items for immediate attention. | Love the app, makes me more productive, more effective & efficient! I am able to track all attempts I ever make with the lead. Great customer service too if I ever have a question or need help with something. Been using 7+ years! | This app makes my sales job so much easier and more efficient, great system for routing and even better way to enter my calls | This app is a God send. I have had it a few years. It crash this last couple weekends. But the company has people to talk to. And they got it fixed. I guess nothing is perfect. 

I had suggested they notify their users if they know the app has crashed. So we can plan accordingly. And let us know when it’s working again. Would sure save us a lot of headaches. 

Thanks for providing this app. | I’ve been using badger for 4+ months now, and the tools it provides are great and can help keep me organized, but I have a hard time rationalizing the 60$ a month for the product. There are a handful of issues, like the app offers customization options for the filters but as soon as you do adjust it a lot of the accounts drop off the map. They have good support and try their best, but it still can cause a headache sometimes. | I downloaded the app then found out there is a charge for their services it didn’t say anything about a charge in the description very deceiving. I only use apps that don’t offer a charge so I deleted the app. | Gotta learn all special options. Can be time consuming. | I never rate apps but I feel like everyone should know that you CANNOT USE IT unless you sign up for their 3 day free trial. First, they make you create an account. Then, they give you the option to either sign up for the trial or SIGN OUT. And of course signing out brings you back where you began 🙃 Stupid and misleading— just make people pay to download it, because this is literally a waste of space. | The app itself is great but once you have any issues with billing, forget it. Not worth the hassle. | I love this app to help visualize my routes, especially since I just started a new job. Also, the customer support team is super great- they respond super quick and are always super helpful. Great app and I highly recommend it | I use Badger EVERY DAY for logging my sales territory activity. Extremely easy to use and route my customers I need to see everyday.
All the different teams that need access to my accounts, like Customer Service or Engineering are all able to leave issue updates within the account so every stays informed for the customer’s benefit.

Badger Support is extremely responsive! | Makes life easier. I can create routes in my territory or for calling on The phone. You can get notified by prospect categories so you don’t miss a prospect! Love the calendar in the app. | The app works very well. It is very versatile and a must when you have multiple sites to service.
Only thing I would like to see improved is the flow through the menus. More UI things then anything. That is just me being picky. | I have been loving this app. I am in my third outside sales job. And this is my first time using Badger. And I LOVE it! There are some very slight UI things that could be improved, but overall the app is very user friendly, works very well with navigation apps, and pairs well with the desktop version. Also the support team is very easy to contact and always helpful. Would recommend! | What I like about this app is that it is easy to use. If I want to see certain accounts all over my territory it lets me pick those and optimize my route on the fly….if I remove an appt I can then re-optimize my route. Great for when you are busy and in a hurry.  Also lets you add quick stop to the list if you need to do a side appt like pick up food or supplies etc. | I couldn’t ask for more.  Great customer service, great app, GREAT JOB! | I can easily and quickly create routes to determine  timeline feasibility.  The software also increases productivity over manual attempts at doing the same travel planning. This helps assure maximum productivity with less time determining the best route.  This product will pay for itself within a one day business trip. | Very easy to use on desk top and mobile.  Also has great check in information | I have to say that this App saved me such a remarkable amount of time I cannot believe how much it changed my life, if you need to map one location to another this is the app to get I had stops and five different towns and all that I had to do was enter the addresses in (Which if you have Exell you don’t even have to do that )And it organized all of my stops in a perfect correct order and saved me hours just one days worth of saving paid for the app.But it’s not only about the money it’s about helping keep your life stress free by not having to optimize your own stops
I cannot say enough good things about this Tech Support was bar none the best I’ve ever had. Don’t take my word for it try their free trial and you’ll find out yourself that is worth every penny | Truly a game changer for me. I have 312 stores as customers. I used to keep notes in a composition notebook. 
Now!!! …… A lot different. This is an awesome app. | Anybody who does not give it 5 starts does not know what they are talking about. I started a new company division with nothing but Badger and some elbow grease! 2 years later, I was generating $30 million in Revenue. | This app is great until its not!  Why won’t it update my route when I make changes. It’s just buffering. I can’t leave one location because it won’t stop buffering and update, then pull up my next trip. | At $60/mo this app is a let down. I’ve used other apps that track routes for $10/mo (ex: route warrior) that have the ability to color code and scan addresses. For someone who works off direct mail leads the address scan feature is huge and I’m surprised that Badger doesn’t have this considering it costs 6x as much. Also no ability to color code or filter by type is frustrating. | I’ve been using Badger maps for about a year and a half now, their support is not good. It is very subpar. If you need some thing you call them or you can email them, and it’s usually at least days before you hear back. There has been many issues with their app from the routing not loading and causing the  to crash, to updates to the app with no allowance of taking pictures at a stop.There are many other good platforms a use for sales besides Badger. | Pretty happy with badger, the fact that I don’t have to wake up and even think about where I’m going for the day is a relief. | Sure it’ll help you map your route but it’s so much more it will help you find customers that you didn’t even know were there it helps to generate call reports to keep your boss happy And  more important it helps you stay organized so that you know what’s been done with every sales call every email every phone call that you make and every time you go back and follow up on the customer you click a button and review it and you get on with the task at hand. | This is a fantastic app.  I’ve been using it for a shot time but it’s great app.  Saves time and money.  Easy to use a fantastic customer service. Doug on of the account mangers is patient and has a ton of knowledge about the app.  Give Badger Maps a test drive and you will never use any other app or program!! | I was looking for an app to help route a new territory I am working. After just a couple days the app is paying for itself.  Setup was, I simply emailed the list and it was loaded and I was planning.  Have not used all the features yet but look forward to doing so in the weeks and months going forward. | Outside reps great tool | App keeps freezing and getting server busy error. Cancelled during trial. | Great total package for getting your game on! | Before I understand how to use Badger I would create my own routes  mapping, etc. Worked well but typing each address in gps after every stop got tiring. I then decided to use Badger as my managers recommended, and once I got an understanding of how to use Badger it got a lot easier.  There  are also filter options I didn’t understand for some time, all I did was send an email to Badger support and boom! That was fix. Even when I didn’t follow-up with Badger support immediately after they got back in touch I received another email from Badger to help me. So I then decided to give Badger a good review. I Highly recommend Badger based on my own experience. 

Evan, ADT rep @ Prime Protection 813 953 72ninenine | It’s an unbelievable value for any modern sales person. | Badger Maps has made all the difference! I was using MapView and wowwww, the developers just stopped caring about the app and customers. The app hadn't had any major updates in 2 years and it was impossible to get assistance quickly. I made the switch recently and I couldn't be happier! Not only is the app and support better, but I find myself no longer being late to meetings, and I love that it syncs with my Google and Apple Calendar and address book. I also enjoy helpful features like the check-ins and notes so I can add things like pictures or important client information all in their contact info. | I’ve used Badger for over 2 years now but the inconsistencies between the app and online are getting worse. I’ve found things I can only do on one or the other like reverse route is only available online. The biggest problem I have is something new, I can no longer delete stops off of my routes on the app, only add or move them. I’m not sure why they made that change but it’s got me thinking about looking for a different program. | I would like to try the app before adding my payment information. You didn't even allow to understand what this app can do, but already asked my credit card 🤷‍♀️ nope. | Crashes daily. takes a long time to load and refresh while trying to quickly enter data and get back on the road.

Was nervous about being a solo traveler but shouldn’t have. Fellow travelers were welcoming. A little snafu by Exoticca on arrival but it was sorted in a few hours and the rest of the trip was exciting, informative about the history and a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ experience! | From picking up in the airport all way home fantastic experience our guide Mohamed very knowledgeable friendly polite and funny very helpful in our needs
Same for the drivers will recommend excoticca travel did a great job | I had to cancel our trip to S America due to cancer treatments and they canceled the wrong trip they canceled a trip I had booked to Greece in September. They would not change my reservation plus they would not refund my deposits on either trip. 
If almost impossible to reach a real person on the phone you have to wait for days for someone to email you back regarding issues. 
I will never use this company again. I love to travel and usually book 2-3 overseas trips per year and have never had issues with other companies 
Customer be aware! | I love exoticca with very reasonable price with good package.. I will use exoticca again definitely.. our tour guide hahmad was wonderful with lots lot’s knowledge of history.. thank you again 👏 | Over all trip was very well organized all hotels were nice except Ramsey Hilton Hotel was good but rooms were outdated I mean really out dated faucet handles falling a part they had moved us second day to newly renovated room because our room had lizard and new room was very nice but my friend had same old room but the hotel was very nice location was perfect other hotels were amazing and their affiliates planet travel was amazing service was outstanding overall I would go with exoticaa again | Overall it was a great experience, but there is definitely room for improvement.  I wish we could have visited more hotels especially in Santorini especially being a popular tourist destination. The Apollo hotel definitely needs to be removed from the itinerary , water needs to be provided to the travel agents and more spare time to do things as we know our clients better than anyone else. Also, the time to do this Fam needs to be changed from April to May right before the high season. | I booked the 9 day tour to Egypt March 2024 and it was fantastic.  I especially loved the 3 day Nile River Cruise. Our tour director was Michael Saad and I have to say he was spectacular!!!  You must ask for him when booking an Egypt tour. So knowledgeable and funny!! Hot air balloon ride is a must also. Book now!! I’m planning my next tour now to Peru!! I can hardly wait!! 
❤️❤️🎶🎶🎉 | I haven’t gone on my trip yet so that (I hope) should be great. However, this app really doesn’t work very well. Too many dead ends that won’t allow you to go back to the main page. There is no way to edit previously entered information. It’s really too frustrating to use. | It’s nice to have this ap , knowing what you’re doing from day today and your flight schedules it’s so useful! | Good company | We recently retired and have a bucket list of adventures to check off. We looked at Perú, for Machu Picchu, through Exoticca and Ecuador for the Galápagos came up also. Since we were flying all that way for one why not do both. The trip was amazing and flawless on Exottica’s part. Excellent guides, who were passionate about their country, in every area that we visited. Met other travelers who were on the same tour, who had booked previous trips with Exoticca, that gave us information on other places to visit. We would defined book through Exoticca again!

Thank You Exoticca
Dennis and Margaret | We just finished a tour of Brazil, Argentina and Chile.  Enjoyed the stunning beauty of south America including Iguazú fall and Patagonia National Parks.  We enjoyed the flexibility of time of transportation and flexible in site seeing arrangement.  Our flight in to Rio was late and had to stay in Bogota for a day, the airline arranged hotel and ride back to airport with meals covered.  As we have a flexible day im Rio so we were rearranged the city tour for the next day.  We enjoyed the trip very much! | Very nice locations, great food and Rita Chaves was an excellent guide! Very knowledgeable and always went above and beyond. | Overall a great experience!  However a few things I would have changed.  On St Patrick’s Day, a viewing of a parade would have been perfect.  We saw the Cliffs that morning and were supposed to go to into limerick.  We skipped all together.  So disappointed that we missed festivities on one of Irelands most popular days.  Second, In cork I would like the option to go to Blarney for an up charge.  We stayed in Corks city centre for 3 hours and nothing to do.  Those 3 hours could have been viewing Blarney Castle.
Other than that the tour was great!  Tour guide Stephen was personable and our bus driver Jerry was amazing also! | Excellent vacation. Jam packed! But the tour guide John was the best!! Can’t wait to find my next adventure! | They have kept my trip money!!! | We just completed a 10 day trip to Ethiopia, 
It was amazing.   We were a little worried  about safety but it was needless.  The trip was well planned and  great.  Ethiopia touched our hearts and stirred our souls.  The stone churches in Lalibela were awe inspiring and a must see in your life.  The castles in Gondar and the tribes in Omo valley were 
fascinating.  Be prepare for heat in the south. Our tour guide, Chris, was the best guide we have had. His passion and understanding for the country was  great. He made the trip wonderful.  Everything went smoothly and everyone was friendly and accommodating.  We didn’t want to leave!  We did take an extra day and did a city tour of Addis Ababa.  It was also great. Don’t miss this cosmopolitan and interesting city.  Make sure to visit the museum.   Lucy is there!  It was a absolutely fantastic tour and time.  Go to Ethiopia, you won’t regret it! | It was purely amazing and our tour guide Maria was so knowledgeable and flexible. Our driver Pedro was also very incredible. I would certainly use exotica again! | I just completed the 9-10 day Ancient Eternal Cities tour and it was magnificent!
As well as getting to know a wonderful small group of new people who where phenomenal, our tour would not have been as amazing, if it were not for our tour guide - Tabata. 

Tabata managed a large group of 30 different personalities with ease. She makes it look easy but I know it is not. The city of Rome, the Vatican and the Basilica were just stunning!

It was a lifetime experience I will never forget!!
Thank you Tabata!! You are the best!! | I will spend the rest of my life riding bad reviews for this company. They did not warn me that not having a visa to enter Vietnam, was tantamount to canceling the trip. I flew my own way to Chicago only to be nine entry into Vietnam and I had to fly back home. I wasted $5000 of my hard earn money for nothing. I will never forgive them for this as they say it was my fault. I’m sorry I have watched other comments and I’ve seen it. Lots of people have had the same problem, I saw one gentleman that his middle name was spelled wrong, and he was not allowed entry. There was no credit offered no way to get my money back. It was just too bad. This is a terrible company. Do not book a trip with them. | I had to cancel my trip due to a broken hip. When my trip was booked last year I was assured that I would either receive a 100% refund or the amount paid would be held for another planned trip. To my surprise, that is not what is going to happen and Exoticca gets to keep my money. Sorry doesn’t cut it when you work hard to save money to spend in your retirement. I will NEVER book with this company again. It only took over 1 1/2 hours on hold before I could finally speak to someone. Think really hard before you book with this company. Apparently you cannot trust the agents that book your trip because I always pay extra for insurance that didn’t appear on my reservation. My mistake for not double checking. I gave the agent the benefit of the doubt that he was competent. | Estamos encantados con todo , los hoteles, los sitios que visitamos , los guías y la transportación. Exoticca cumplió con todo lo ofrecido, GRACIAS! Volveremos muy pronto a España, nos encanta! | First time using a travel agency type, so did not know what to expect, my coworker who travels a lot was skeptical, but it all worked out, a few things I would have changed, the tour guides were  good but one was not, speaking English, trying to communicate what we were seeing etc…, there was another couple that had a private guide and he spoke English and was very well versed in the culture, we had time by ourselves and with others in the group.We really enjoyed the trip and would use exotica again | Had a wonderful experienced with this company. Everything was well planned, information and direction was super helpful. Tour guide was good but some may need a little more training. Our tour guide was sweet but they tend to rush us. Great experienced overall. Would definitely book again. Until again…kanpai! | We recently did Portugal trip with Exottica, we started our trip with open mind not really knowing what to expect. Exottica team did such an organized trip that they set themselves a class apart from day one. From organized pick up from airport to hotel and the pick ups everyday was outstanding, our tour guide was so well informed- Eduardo santo- he kept the entire trip lively giving us valuable information about the place and engaging us in meaningful conversation and making us feel comfortable the entire trip . Every location we stopped was well thought of and planned. We also had ample time to explore the place on our own. Overall an excellent experience and I would recommend !! | We loved the country, but feel the experience would have better having a tour coordinator with our group of 5. Many things may have been out of control due the busy season , like being able to have someone meet us daily to go over for example the length of the transportation, what to expect and assistance with restaurant choices. Even though we did not speak Spanish, most of the time we did well, but made sure our small group was together | It was our 1st experience through exoticca and this was beyond our expectations. Tour guide Mr. Kadir was excellent. Awesome!!! | I would not recommend this agency to any body.  I used them for Peru trip and it was awful.   Unfortunately I made another trip with them and I can not cancel with them.   I would not recommend any body use them.   Their customer service and the tour was awful. | Vivian Nguyen was tremendous. She was a great communicator. Her contacts for transportation, guides and hotels were second to none.  
She was easy to communicate with. Always patient and caring. 
We look forward to another trip that she would be the travel agent. | This is the worst trip I have ever had!!!! Over 75 bug bites, 90 hours on a bus, 21 hours of actual tour, no air conditioning in hotels, over heating on a tour, incomplete and false descriptions in your brochure and having to pee in bushes!!!!!!  Horrendous road conditions and a bus with a loud buzzing to torture you the hole ride.  I am leaving here totally distraught.  I will be contacting you when I return. | This trip is one of the most memorable. We were the only couple that booked the date Jan 28 2024 for a 10 day trip thru travelzoo.  The hotels exoticca booked for us from Rome, Florence and Venice were comfortable and clean. The drivers assigned to pick us up to our destinations are all professionals and friendly.  Our tour leader Manny was very knowledgeable and attentive to all our needs. We have learned a lot from her.  The tour guides assigned from the colosseum, the Vatican, Florence and Venice are all exceptional. It was such a wonderful and memorable experience we will treasure for life.  For being so happy with the service I already convinced my sister and her husband from Seattle to book the same trip for November. They already confirmed their booking. We have another trip booked with you for Portugal this November as well. We are so excited and we are looking forward  to travel with your agency. Thank you so much for making our travel very memorable and exciting. | Basic city tours provided by Exotica were good overall. However, the guides were not fluent in the English language. Another fact to note was that individuals had to book many extra excursions to fill their day to enjoy each country. The additional excursions were much more expensive bought from Exotic then if you buy them through the tour guide directly. A big drawback for Exotica was that we were on our own the entire time. Their was No welcome meeting, gathering or dinner to introduce us to our guide or give us an introduction to the country. We met other Exotic travelers on different tours and some were in our hotel and others were at different hotels. It would be nice if we traveled as a group and stayed at the same hotel(s) since we did travel on most of the tours together. We spent at least one hour before each tour picking up passengers from other hotels  and in Argentina the bus driver/ guide( Exotica)  would not drop us off back at the hotel where we were picked up but had 3 dedicated drop off stops where people would have to take a taxi back to their hotel. | The trip was wonderful.Exotica your is great ! | Needs more details like flight numbers, detailed hotel information, visa costs etc | Our 10-day tour throughout Morocco was a truly magical adventure.  Our primary guide was like one of the family and other guides in 3 different cities provided great insight into culture and local manufacturing crafts.  The night in tents at edge of the Sahara was an event to climax majesty of the tour. | We had an amazing honeymoon to Peru through Exoticca! Our tour guides, drivers, hotels, etc were amazing and all very helpful.  We would 100 percent book through Exoticca for our next trip! | This is the 1st time I went to a guided tour trip. My experience was mixed.
It all depends on your luck, who is your coordinator, who is the tour guide.
The tour coordinator is very young. I think he is trying to do his best, however his best is far from adequate. We landed at Cario before 5pm, but did not get a room until 9pm. We arrived the hotel after 7pm, may be 7:30pm? We were asked to wait at the lobby. After long wait, I went to take a look. I found the coordinator was talking on the phone with 3 passports in hand. I asked him please work on getting us a room. We had been on the road for more than 30 hours at this point. There were total 3 people in this group, 2 were over 70. I followed the coordinator to go the counter. I would not leave him until I have the room key. The hotel staff started to take information, then he left. I thought he was going to take our key. No, he disappeared for some 20 minutes before returning. So we waited more than a hour to get a room. 
Next morning, we were in a 3 people group to see the pyramids. We did not take the optional tour in the afternoon. The next day the 3 people group went to Alexandria. At this time, the tour guide has developed a good relationship with the one who went to optional tour with him the previous day. They were in deep conversation constantly. I was not sure if the discussion was related to the tour or something else. I did not hear much from the guide, besides the places listed in the itinerary, we did not pass anywhere. I felt I did not see Alexandria besides a few places which are not that interesting comparing to other places I visited later. At this moment, I seriously doubt about the value of such tours.
The following day the 3 people group joined a large group of 21 people. This was the best thing happened to me for this trip. The tour guide Emil was fantastic. He was able to take care all 24 people. He was so knowledgeable. He taught us a lot of more than the description one can find online. As I was a late addition, often I did not know when he said as I told you at Cario. Emil was willing to repeat some to me in details. Emil added a 30 minutes discussion about culture of the Egypt on his own time. He was so passionate about letting us to know Egypt. One solo guest suffered injury during the trip, Emil attended him. I purchased optional tour. He arranged credit card payment. 
I wanted to take part the optional tour with him at Cario. But it was impossible with my coordinator. With my coordinator, everything has to be cash. I had WhatUp text messages with him to ensure I can pay credit card. At Cario, he brought me to a ATM. It was impossible to communicate with him in a normal manner.
For Emil, I gave 6 stars. For the portion with my coordinator, 2 stars, thanks for putting me in that unforgettable 4-day  cruise with Emil, otherwise it would be 1 star. So it averaged to 4 stars. 
At Cario, I walked into the same place where Emil was leading the other group. I could not pull myself back not to get near to listen his talk. I was asked to stay with my guide. I understand. Seeing my new friends in the other group absorbed in Emil’ talk, I knew how much I missed. They had a 20 minutes long talk with Emil. My guide led us walking through the place. 
So, it depends on your luck. | This was my first trip to Egypt with Exotica 12/06-12/14. The guides who picked us up at the airport did not offer to discuss what we saw as we drove to our first Hotel. We had to initiate an open end question in order for them to interact. Reason for 4 stars. Nevertheless, our tour guide Elia was very educated, professional and patient and we enjoyed all his tours. | We were in the dark about most information during our trip- and had to rely on others to be in the right spot at the right time.    We stayed in some crappy hotels.   Will never use your company again. | I just got back from Italy. We went to Rome, Florence and Venice. The hotel in Rome was kind of far from everything and was a three star hotel. The hotel in Florence was also three stars. The hotel in Venice was a four star hotel. It was across from the train station to Venice. They all provided breakfast in the mornings, which was very nice. The trip was organized and we had lots to do. We had different guides who knew much about what they were showing us and it was enjoyable. in Rome we had to take a taxi a lot. It would’ve been nicer if there was a shuttle or a bus to take us places. Altogether, we had so much fun and I would take another trip with the company again. The price was reasonable too. | Great communication throughout the journey. Enjoyed very much. Looking to takeoff to more destinations. | This entire packaged vacation was AMAZING! Maria our tour guide was simply the best! I am more than happy that we chose Exoticca to travel with, they went above our expectations. We will definitely be booking again! | Our guided trip through Portugal was better than we expected. Our guide Eduardo was exceptional, with knowledge beyond our expectations. It was a wonderful experience. Great accommodations, comfortable bus tour, lots to see and do. I highly recommend this trip. Eduardo, thank you for a wonderful guided tour. Excellent. | Fabulous itinerary, country , guide and group! 
I can’t say enough good things about my first Exoticca trip! AO | It’s my first time traveling with exotica ..seriously  you can trust this company ,was amazing trip!thanks exotica | We just returned from the trip from Madrid to Barcelona. Our accommodations and tours were very good. Our guides were knowledgeable and friendly. Octavio was our guide for 4 days, and we enjoyed our time with him. 
My feelings of the trip are mixed. We saw many things we likely would not have found on our own. However, I feel we were over scheduled with not enough time to see things or shop along the way. We were hurried along to stay on time. For example, when we were in Valencia at the biggest market in all of Europe, we were given 20 minutes to shop. There were many more hours spent on the bus than I expected, and meals at truck stop sort of places along the way. Also, considering the many hours on the bus, there was no bathroom facility on the bus. 
While the brochure mentioned we would arrive at a town with time to shop or check out restaurants, it was too late when we got there to see or do anything. 
The value of the trip was very good and well worth what we paid. More free time or opportunities to take a break during a tour would have made the trip more enjoyable. | We had a wonderful time, hotels were good, staff was great, the guides - Andre, was excellent, he joined on 11/9 due to personal reasons but Exxotica arranged two different guides , 11/7 was Matthew and 11/8 we had a Nunu both were great people, knowledgeable, friendly people! 
We learned the Portuguese culture, life style!
Only problem we had with the Portugal airline, they were very strict with their luggage policy, this is a international travel, at least one bag they should give free for check in , if not free then should charge minimum of $50. Their charge was 117 one way, this was ridiculous and taking advantage of the travelers! 
We would recommend others certainly also we would consider Exoticca for ourselves in future | My first time booking with Exotica and I can not wait to book with them again. Our tour guide, Tiago was amazing to say the least. 
Hotels were nice and clean. THANK YOU!!!!! | Our first time booking with Exoticca & it did not disappoint. It was super well organized we got to experience the best of Italy & we will forever be thankful for such a wonderful experience our guide was also so wonderful on recommending local spots to enjoy delicious food.

I’ve had the app for about a year now; planned several day trips and international jaunts with it by my side. Of course, always check the area a new place is in, do your due diligence, but this app saves countless hours and because it is curated I have had maybe only one failed rec. It is still a little glitchy at times, but like wine, that will get better with age.  No matter if you are travelling near or far, trust, you need AmiGo in your life. | Thought I’d try it out but really unusable. It’s slow and not well made as many things don’t even work, I’m on an iPhone 15 pro. Deleted. | 10/10 | Such an easy and effective app! I love it! I use it when I’m at home or when I travel. It’s so helpful to find the best places to stay, eat, see and shop! So thoughtful and intuitive! Love the ratings and comments! This is a must application for anyone who loves to travel and explore the world with honest genuine advice from friends and family and influencers | Love this for showing me recs I actually trust to be similar to my own taste and rendered nicely visually vs Yelp. Would dock a star since the UX/UI is challenging sometimes and things are slow to load which is a nuisance, but won’t because am too loyal to the app and think it’s just an early set of bugs they’ll fix. | I love this App. It’s a Godsend in travel planning!  So easy to use and such a breath of information on restaurants hotels and area attractions!  A must download for any traveler! | An absolute must-have ! AmiGo is such an amazing app for trusted recs all over the world, and I love how I can keep track of all the places I've been and find inspiration for future trips - even for local spots near me! | The best travel app!! | This app is incredibly helpful. It helps you plan any trip in advance but the excellent map feature enables you to also make plans on the go. I have used in several countries and the recommendations have been consistently excellent. Very reliable. Download this app now!!! | I absolutely love using Amigo when I travel. It has the best recommendations and is super easy to use. I love having my recommended restaurants, shops, museums, etc all in one place. I plan to use this app for all of my future trips!!!! | Such a great app. I use it to plan all my trips now. So many great recommendations | I love using this app to save and plan all my travel!! Highly recommend! | This app is a must-have for anyone who loves travel, food & exploring - my trusted source for on-the-go | I don’t know if it’s my phone or the app but I’ve had this app for eight hours and it’s been very frustrating, not very user friendly and lacking a lot of basic destinations or venues. I’ve even found some pretty lame spelling mistakes. I guess because it was invite only I thought it would be top tier. It has not been this far and my time is too precious to waste on slow, less than optimal apps. Disappointed. | Good concept but the app itself is pretty bad to the point that it’s unusable at this stage. It’s very slow and the filters don’t work at all. The locations are sometimes inaccurate. I was going to use it for a recent trip but I eventually gave up on it due it’s usability issues. | Amigo is so useful! Love how easy it is to share and receive recommendations. 

I’ve found some really cool, under the radar places because of it. | I love this app so far! It’s really fun to use and to add your own recommendations of your favorite spots. I like using it to make wish lists for my future travels too. This app feels that it is just people who love to travel, leaving honest reviews and recommendations. It’s like asking your friends for their travel recs, but everything (and everywhere) is all in one spot. | Love it. Just wish it ran faster as the load time on browse and photo upload is a bit pesky. | Intuitive and easy to use! Im loving iit 😍 | I love that the recs come from my network or from people that know about the place I’m traveling to. | Coool App!! Useful💪💪 | Great app to share great locations around the world!! | F | Exciting to have a great app with  wonderful suggestions and various  places to experience. 
Congratulations! | I use a lot of apps and do heavy research and planning before traveling, and this app saves me soooo much time and saves me from reading through random reviews from people I don’t know that have different tastes and lifestyles than I do. Finally the app i’ve been waiting for! | I have been waiiiiting for an app like this!  I always forget the great places I go when I travel and this makes it SO easy to log and share it!

All the chargers were broken, and thanks to this app I was able to find a ton of chargers around me that I didn’t even know existed. Chargeway literally saved me in a moment when I didn’t even know what to do. Thanks chargeway! | Hands down the best charging app available right now. The user interface is easy to navigate, they’re always keeping charging station locations/data updated, and do a much better job at explaining charging levels than the other apps. This is truly the new standard in charging apps. | Love the new design of the Chargeway app - Selecting my car with a beautiful image and all the site location photos are helpful. 

I don’t think the route planning works very well, however. It takes forever to load and several times, I’ve mapped a route with 1 charging stop when I really needed 2 or more. Drivers rarely go at a consistent speed, and I’m not sure if this app accounts for elevation change or other variables yet that impact driving range. 

I love the attempt at a numbering system, but it kinda feels like a new language instead of communicating in miles per kWh or miles per hour. Also, I see many drivers look for the highest number charger when their EVs can’t accept more than 50 kW! A faster charge isn’t always better. It needs to fit the car and intended visit time. | A very simple number system and my go to app to find charging stations. | I had used most of the EV charging apps and just tried Chargeway.  Chargeway is the best EV charging app that I have used and the user interface is excellent. It’s much easier to quickly find EV charging stations with specific capabilities. | I find the trip planning in this app to be easier to use than others I have tried | Better trip planner than most other apps. Very similar to what you find in the Tesla main display and mobile app.  Tells you the stops and about how long you will be stationary charging.  You can enter starting battery charge, AVG driving speed and temp to try and get a more accurate estimate.  Will start using this instead of PlugShare for planning purposes. | Best of all apps I went through all very easy in app navigate... This a Google search of chargers | I used to be able to flip the trip to see my soc when after arriving to my destination to see what my soc is before heading back. Bring this feature back. Why did you take it away? Dumb. | After I told the app I drove a Tesla model Y it would not show me any of the other charging stations, only Tesla. However, I have a J1772 adapter and it will not give me the option to use those plugs or stations. | So I’m shockingly surprised just how accurate this app is. I took a 853 miles road trip using this app. It showed all the stop points to charge and the time it would take to charge. A simple click on your next charge point show you your arrival SOC and how long to charge. To my surprise it was extremely accurate for my 2020 Kia Niro EV. Routing to the next charge point you could choose Apple, Google or Waze map. I simple love this app. Tesla, Ford and Rivian has great trip planners in their vehicle. If your vehicle don’t have one you can definitely use Chargeway as your next trip planner.  It’s simply layed and very easy to use. I highly recommend this app. It’s also great to use around town as well. You can’t go wrong with this. If you don’t have ABRP premium this is the app to use. Bravo team Chargeway. Very well done. Very well done!!!! | I have 9 EV charging apps on my phone because each app is excellent at one or more aspects of the experience but no one app is good at all aspects. In my opinion, an excellent app has to:
1) show me the eligible chargers at my current location and display how long/fast the charging will be at each unit. Also display which units are being currently used. 2) plan several routes of a trip, show the best charging options along each route and again delineate how long/fast I’ll be charging at each station then let me choose which route works best for me. 2a) understand that the best EV route is not always the google maps route. 3) Show amenities, food, activities, shopping around the EV charger where time can be occupied while charging. 4) offer user reviews of the charging station. This app comes close but doesn’t perform 2 very well. On a trip a recently took, one of the stops it recommended for all three routes recommended I charge for 4.5 hours. I don’t do these trips often but no way am I turning an 8 hour trip to one of 12+. So I use another app to plan my route and this one for other things. | There were 4 stations at 51st Ave & Bell. Two had power lights on and two did not. None of the chargers worked. We spent 30 min trying to get them to turn on using the app :/ | Whenever I need to plan a road trip or I’m in a new city, this is hands down the easiest and simplest app to use for charging. | Much easier to quickly see what stations are faster than others. App just needs more users so that there are more reviews of the stations within it. | I was disappointed when I downloaded the app only to discover that unless your electric vehicle is in their preexisting list, the trip planner doesn’t work. | Every time a plan a trip the app keeps pulling in charge stations I don’t want to use.  This needs fixing.  If I choose EA network only as an example, a trip should only show EA!   But every time I do this other stations pop in to my trip which are right next to the one I want.  Very frustrating.  Other things work really well but needs help. Also would love to be able to adjust the % of battery at end of a trip to higher % making you change longer at last station as many destinations in small towns have no chargers and only a level 1 plug at most.  A few tweaks this app could be perfectly! | Best EV charger finder out there. | To add a vehicle you need to register. Why do you need my phone number to do so? And when I only put my name and zip code I get the “random” error message “Error - CustomMethodExpection”??? | Easy and robust. The trip planning feature is excellent in identifying charging stations with your car’s compatible chargers. And clicking on the station lets you know speed and number of chargers, as well as amenities in the area. The app also provides the soc on arrival and departure from the station. Their customer support is second to none. I recently contacted them via their app, and rec’d a response the same day. I was contacted by a rep who gave me one-on-one tutoring on using the app. As someone who is not very techy, this was extremely helpful. I am taking my first long road trip with my EV in a few weeks, and will do so with much more confidence. The Chargeway Team is committed to standing out as the gold standard EV app. | As always developers have good ideas but they failed executing them or maybe not putting much work after they release their app.
In this case the app has multiple inaccuracies like charging station max speed. Dispenser rated 350kwh when in fact they are 150… Finally on my phone iPhone 14 pro, the trip planner is stuck in a loop. There are so many EV app available out there. If you go the extra mile to create one. Please make sure it add value or at least it works. Otherwise you are not helpful to the EV community. | After playing with several this is by far the most useful charging app I have used.  Better coverage than others and let’s you take into account your make, model, speed, and temp. Results for road trips so far have been accurate. | Looks good on my iPhone, although I haven’t had time yet to really test it. But since it opens with a blank screen on my Bolt EUV, it’s not very useful for a travel app.

Update after the developer response. Changed from 2 stars to 4. Apparently, they didn’t read what I wrote. I said it was blank in Car Play. Not just no chargers. No map, no nothing.

Anyway, I tried again a few days later and it seemed to work OK as far as displaying information. I haven’t had a chance to try it yet on a trip. | The 1-6 charging system is confusing. Chargers are already identified as L1-L3 and have a kwh rating. Using Chargeways own proprietary system to label charging speeds pointlessly obscures the information and terminology that would be used anywhere else. | This app/company captures *way* too much private information - read their privacy policy (which strangely has not been updated since 2018).    

They don’t need 95% of the info they capture to provide what this app provides - so what are they planning to do with all that private info? 

There are several alternative products which provide the same info and services without requiring this much private info.

 “ We collect personal information that you provide to us such as name, address, vehicle information, VIN and contact information.”

  “ The personal information we collect can include the following: Name and Contact Data.  We collect your first and last name, email address, postal zip code, phone number and other similar data.”

If you wish to chage our access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings. Mobile Device Data.We may automatically collect device information, operating system, version information and IP address.”

 “ We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, as well as from other third parties.  Examples of the information we receive from other sources include: social media profile information, marketing leads and search results and links, including paid listings.”

  “We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this privacy policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.” | Downloaded and tried to open the app but can’t get past the animated start screen. Deleted app/reinstalled but get same results. | Looks useful but missing CCS1 adapter chargers. | If traveling for extended distances across state lines, this app is perfect for planning your trip to ensure you know when and where to stop to charge your vehicle.  This app gives you the peace of mind required to ensure your EV vehicle is left stranded with a charge.  

I have used others and found Chargeway to be the most reliable. | I recently purchased a used LEAF that I absolutely love. As a shorter range EV it is great for traveling around my metro area. Although I don’t often use public charging stations when I do Chargeway is the first app I open to see all my available options for electric fuel. | I created an account, saved my car, but the app can’t seem to remember it every time I open it. I have to re-program it constantly. | Their goal is to make charging easier - by obscuring the underlying details and incorrectly classifying what your vehicle can and cannot use. For example, it might say you are a “4” max despite being able to get the best charge at a “5.” That will cost you time and money. Worse yet - YOU CAN CHANGE WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN. From a simplified universal system to completely meaningless in 3 seconds. Beyond the basic premise, it’s not a good app. Crashes a lot, mediocre design, super basic features, no real integration with the vehicle itself, no understanding of actual charging curves. It pretends to know your vehicle, but really doesn’t. | I really like the design philosophy and trip planning capabilities - far superior to the many other apps I have used for this purpose including ABRP, charger network specific and network aggregation apps, and the in-built apps on our Mach-e, Kia Niro EV and previous Chevy Bolts.

Would be great to see the following features for the smartphone app (I'm using the iOS version):

Support for multiple vehicles for a single user account (an everyday need for multiple EV households where drivers can switch between vehicles).

Saving planned routes on the app - they disappear if the app is closed.

Add additional waypoints for route planning - only a few are currently enabled and for our planned full r/t tour of the west coast for example, it's not enough for optimal route planning. 

Customization of vehicle charger default configurations. Sure we're J1772/CCS in both of our vehicles but also carry a TeslaTap for charging at Tesla destination chargers too (thanks Elon!). It would be ideal if non-supercharger Tesla AC chargers could be considered as compatible with our J1772 cars and appear coded in green like the J1772/CCS stations do.

Getting the charger status information to work on the apo - that's important for basic functionality.

And then the moonshot involving some API heavy lifting on the backend - I actually really like the Mach-e in-built nav system interface and display (aside from its dreadful route planning and inaccurate charger location information) and prefer it to Google Maps, Waze etc running through CarPlay. In general I'm seeing a big improvement in the quality of in-built Nav in general across several car companies. So would it be too much to ask to be able to upload the route plan to the in-built nav system? I know that's a lot to ask but...

Thanks! | Smooth and filters information to help plan routes. Used to drive from FL to NYC and perfected this to several other route planners | I can’t get past the start screen… keeps crashing when I try to enter my phone number. Also, why do you need our phone number?! I get enough spam texts/calls already. | Requires an account with your Phone number to use any of its features, even just to look at the map to see local chargers. No thanks, I’ll stay with PlugShare. | when you open the app it shows 0 charging stations even though i live in a city and they’re everywhere. i have connection and tried refreshing the app, nothing. i don’t understand the point or how they have so many good reviews. | Sorry guys, got to give you a poor rating because you don’t seem to offer a way to create an account without handing over my phone number. Give me an alternative and I’ll try this app again. | After downloading every single EV charging app in the store I came across this. This one includes all the networks, and makes it clear and easy to see what level chargers are where and doesn’t only show certain networks. | Maybe this app works, maybe it doesn’t. I downloaded it to enter the information for my car to see how it worked, yet I am unable to do anything specific to my vehicle without providing my name, phone number, and zip code. I understand how this information could legitimately be helpful to the app if I decided to keep it and wanted to save my information, but I can’t get to the point where I would be comfortable providing it with my phone number if I can’t try the app. 

This app looks promising, but spam calls are far too irritating to risk giving my number to an app that I am not yet familiar with. I may give it a try again someday if this requirement is changed. | This app wants all of your information before it will do anything for you. Plug share let’s you get on with no hassle. A better route planner is the way to go if you want to plot a trip. | Doesn’t let you see details about the stations.  Pick what type of adapters you have.   

Lets not hide the details of the type of plugs. 

I was recommended this app for finding hotels that have charging.   Just adding my cars to it and it’s making me feel like the developers think we are too stupid to understand the inputs our cars can accept.   

Sure add a filter for people that don’t want details, but don’t treat us all like morons. | I enjoy the app so far. My favorite feature is the estimated time at an EV station. But there are still some things I’d like to see tweaked before it becomes my main charging app. First, where you can move the circle to divie up between miles needed vs. miles remaining, I'd like to be able to tap on the ""322 mi"" the middle of the circle to switch from miles to energy/percentage. Second, the filter still doesn't fully work. In the filter section, If I only enable the ChargePoint Network and the DC adapter (Blue 3 and up), the map results still show stations that are only AC (Green 1/2)

 And to add another for finer points to my filter critique, I've realized that the filter is only adhered to when the ""My current vehicle"" filter is on. For ex.: If you just have AC (Green) adapters enabled, it still displays all level (Green/Blue/Red) charging stations. But if I filter with AC & My current vehicle, then it correctly just shows the Green & Red. Same scenario goes with Blue vs. Blue&Red. And noticed that any of the filter line colors and numbers become highlighted ONLY when My current vehicle is chosen as a filter. Please fix this!

Edit: Thanks to Matt for giving me a ring, personally, and further explaining how to JUST get AC adapter map results or JUST DC adapter map results. I also appreciate you taking down some of my small app feedback. I'll be using the app more often and I'm looking forward to having the ability to see either Miles or Energy in the Timer Section! | Great app, I would give it 5 stars but it only lets you navigate to 4 stops including your starting location and destination which means you can really only choose two charging locations. Sad. | I am new to the EV world. And I did not know how much goes into planning a trip with an EV. I downloaded Chargeway to play and plan random trips. The color codes (red for Tesla) made it super easy to find charging stations along the route, and green for other chargers with the adapter (something that the Tesla does not find). So far I planned trips to Lake Tahoe, the Grand Canyon and an excursion through the State of Oregon. I would recommend Chargeway to anyone that is new to the EV community or thinking about joining. Great App! | Just downloaded from the App Store but I can’t register. | No thanks. App is useless unless you give them your phone number. | Really nice app for locating chargers. I can't wait to see the ability to submit reviews in the app for sites and it would be neat if the app sees I am by “Charger XYZ” and that there are two cars plugged in there and those owners use the app too if I could message asking how long they might be or if I see they are full to let them know I was unplugging them. Just a way to communicate that wouldn’t share phone or email and just would let you “see” vehicles at the same charge site as you. I love the way it labels chargers simply with a colour and number. Some non-network stations are not yet in here but if people submit missing ones this app can be very complete. | So, let’s be real. This app is fantastic. With that being said. They need to get accurate pricing on this app related to each charging station.

The scanning will take ages if you have lots of pictures in your camera roll. I actually could never get it to entirely load even on fast WiFi and letting it sit for 30+ min. Why can’t it just not scan the photos and allow us to select what we want? Or have that as an option? I already knew what photos I wanted to use for each location I don’t want help selecting them! Plus my location is not on for all of my photos so then it wasn’t detecting the places I’ve actually been. There’s no good way to do that just let us do it our selves! I was disappointed as I liked the general idea but the execution was not good. | Will you be adding the Caribbean islands? | 🥺🥺 | Love the concept but can’t get my photos to save | Would give  5 stars but Aruba is missing. Please add | Wish it worked across devices but this is the only app that visually does what I want | Need to add Singapore | I was looking for an app to mark where I've been and thought, "" wouldn't it be cool if there was one where I could use my own pictures?""  Not only does this app do that, it does it so well!

It's easy to use and I like it so much I upgraded. | Even though the Location data is correct on the photos, it does not see it in the list to pick a photo . Also when I choose a photo from my library, it will not save on the map.   Great concept though. | I love the idea of this app but I wish there were more countries such as smaller caribbean countries etc. | I wasn’t sure if you’d see it, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw your response. Thank you very much! :) | I love to travel and be able to keep up with where I have been and where I haven’t!

However when in a country or state it won’t scroll up to list the rest of the places or if I’m trying to select a picture it won’t let me scroll up either. I deleted the app and the downloaded again but it didn’t help | For some reason it will show up on the map like when I put the photo in and click the checkmark it doesn’t show up on the map itself so it’s good but just doesn’t work. | Easy to use;  well designed. | It basically only scans your “Recents” folder. I have 70,000 photos synced from my computer and this didn’t include any of them. So it shows I’ve only been to 2 states when in fact I’ve been to 30+ and several countries. | I love this app but I am a bit confused because an entire piece of Africa is missing half of Somalia is just not on the map the area called Somaliland | I can’t even upload a freaking picture app is stupid | It would be cool if the user could rename the maps titles and add multiple maps for group travel vs personal tracking | Wouldn’t place any of my 460 pictures?? | We really like this app for sharing where we’ve been because it includes photos and makes cool maps!! | This is an excellent app, which provides a great way to visualize your travels.  It's fun to see how many counties within a state we've been to.  The app does a good job of letting you quickly and easily pick a representative photo for each country/state/county region you've been to.  

Highly recommended! | I like it but could let you make the pictures better for it | The app is great except there’s no way to back up or sync maps. I’d love an iCloud sync option so I don’t need to simply save the partial maps I have with meticulously cropped/rotated photos into each border shape! | Fun idea and works relatively well. However, it does not sort all photos correctly. If the location is relatively close to a different state (even a few miles within the state), it often sorts them into wrong ones. Manual selection does not work in those cases either! You can select a photo, but it doesn’t show up in the map on my iPad Pro 12.9 M1 ( It works on my M1 MacBook Air though) | It keeps glitching and going to the beginning. | Best app ever | Beautifully designed and built app. No useless features, just a really easy, fun way to track travel. | This app was exactly what I was looking for. Perfectly perfect!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! | I downloaded this on the way home from a road trip- wow!  What a fantastic app.  I had a lot of fun tracking our trips and adding pictures.  Will continue to use this app for years to come! | I love this app! It is very easy to change the photo selected by the program or to adjust the picture that was selected. I second the idea of using photo dates to re-create a trip itinerary. We do many road trips and it would be awesome to see each journey outlined are highlighted in someway. Thank you. You have done an excellent job with this app and I’m excited to see your future improvements. | I upload 9pics for 9differents states because thats all i have. but i dodnt know how to check out or proceed the process looks like no option. Please can somebody help me. Thanks! 
im new to this.. | I downloaded it and bought the pack on my iPad, but I can’t upload or save any photos to the maps. Waste of money if you want to uae it on the iPad. | Favorite app of all time!! I bought the explorer pack I absolutely love. However, why is there no sections split up for Switzerland? I’ve been to many different parts and it would be cool to see. Nothing big though for issues love the app!!! | This is a really cool app! The United States map is incredible… I love being able to track all the states that I have been to over the years. I'd love to see features such as cropping the photo and moving it to fit the state. Without this feature it makes it hard to pick a photo. I hope to see a upgrade to printing or ordering the photo for those with a photo map. 
(Not sure if this is an upgrade with in the app) 
I'm not sure if this is the same thing, but the online version is a little bit better as i can crop and move and order with company! I also discovered this neat idea through tiktok. | Nice but We should be able to resize photo in state and also have multiple pics in a state | I have a feature request: since the photos contain dates, you could recreate an approximate itinerary for every trip. To know what is considered a trip, the user would have to set its home country. Then a trip is effectively the places visited while outside of the home country. Moreover, min and max dates while outside the home country would be the trip duration. Given a new view for Trips then the user could quickly find fotos of every trip. It could be ordered chronologically. 

Keep up the great work! | I. Cant add anymore photos | It’s an awesome app, I love it. I just wish I could create multiple maps for all of my travels with different people. Other than that I really enjoy the app🙂 | Keeping the iOS eco-system clean, neat and tidy. Came across this creatively simple app after months! Nicely made.

Edit:
Updated to 3 stars from 5 after the in-app purchase that unlocks other countries. Other countries only show states while missing the cities left alone counties. | When you try to select a photo after granting access to your photo library, the scrolling does not work properly. When you scroll towards the bottom to see more pictures instead it just resets back to the top. This is happening on an iPhone 12 Pro.

Update: Still broken on iPhone 13 Pro | One of my favorite apps. Explorer’s Pack is worth every penny. | Definitely worth the download! Can’t wait to add more places I’ve been. Would be cool to pair to my Facebook. | What I haven’t have some pictures in some counties so I putted colors and you won’t access me so when I mark it visited it won’t let me and sometimes it crashes I deleted this app 1 time | I downloaded this app on my iPad and it will not upload any photos at all to the maps. Please fix this. | fix your app please | I love this app so much but two problems
problem 1. there is a bug when you try to store a photo on Figi,when you select it it goes back to “World Countries”.
problem 2. I want you to make a National photo for maps of countries or continents. | Bc | Love the concept of the app but I can’t upload multiple photos.

Lovely that the developer is responding to reviews - please for the love of New Yorkers, change this back. | The old app was relatively easy to use and the information could be found without a million taps. This one is so clunky and even for someone very familiar with NYC transit is almost unusable.  We just want to be able to see the train/bus schedules and updated real-time arrival information without having to go through a ton of hoops. | Bring back the older version.
So much more work to get the schedule.
Confusing and opposite of helpful | The new app doesn’t load and when it does it’s slow. The direction is confusing when looking at a subway station, as is the bus direction. | The last three or four updates have been completely worthless… They launch and then disappear from the screen. When you swipe up and over to quit the various apps suddenly there is the MTA app…! Tapping on it repeats the cycle of crashing… What did you break? | Absolutely, horrible service ! It’s appropriate name should be stress A Ride ! I’m a disabled woman and the service between the MTA and the phone operators lets not even talk about the drivers OMG Just absolutely Horrible service! By rare occasions, you come across a great driver professional helpful kind , but majority of the time your not so lucky sad to say !

They need to make improvements badly across the board in every department! ASAP | This app is garbage.

Uses strange terms like “explore” and “status”. How about bring the old app back, which was direct, like NYers! NYers want to know where their train is. That is it. What a waste of time and money. | I hate the updated app. They took a great app and made it mediocre. The old one was so much more user-friendly. Please, just give us the old app back! | The app doesn’t show the time the train will arrive. It shows how many minutes for the train to arrive so you have to add the minutes shown to the current time to get the actual time the train will arrive. Very disappointing. I want to see the time the train will arrive instead of having to click to see it. | This new update is worse than the one it replaced.  I check it for my bus’ location and it frequently shows no activity, only for the bus to arrive a few mins later.  The MTA is inept at everything it does.  They certainly deserve no more money until they fix their quality and safety woes.  Add this app to the pile. | Let me start out with: I really want this app to work. The subway is such an amazing way to get around New York, and this app has the opportunity to make it even easier for everyone. But it's falling short. A few of the issues that have yet to be resolved:
-Somehow, the arrival times are less accurate than they were in the old app. Also, there's no ETA, only a countdown clock, which makes it harder to plan when to get to the station and transfers. 
-It takes many more clicks to get to useful information in the app. The subway lines used to be grouped by ""good service"" and ""delayed"" so you knew at a glance which way to head if you had multiple options. Now that information is spread out and buried, meaning it takes longer to make a decision about which line to take.
-When you open a station detail window, there's so much wasted space that only the first 1.5 trains are visible. More taps/scrolling to get to the information you need quickly. 
-Also in the station detail window, it defaults to mixing uptown and downtown trains in the countdown list. What is the point of this? I don't care about trains going in ANY direction, I care about the trains going ONE direction or the other. Why would this be the default?
-In the map view, downtown stations inexplicably default to the top of the list for every train line, which breaks the brain of anyone familiar with NYC geography. If you change the order from the default, it infuriatingly switches back the next time you open the app. 
-The app STILL doesn't include live train locations, even though this has been available on the MTA website for years now. 

I was really hoping that the MTA would improve on what was at least a useable app, but this new app is just a disappointment. Please, please listen to the regular users and make this better! | The app was great before. Occasional glitches and errors, sure, but 95% of the time it was accurate and up to date. Now it’s wrong as often as it’s right and it’s super tedious to navigate. They changed the defaults but there’s no way to customize the settings to view subway routes, so you have to reset the direction every time, they made it way easier to mistake whether you’re looking at an uptown or downtown train, they took away the arrival times and now it just says how long until the next train (and it’s often wrong). It’s such a huge clusterf*** that I’m back to the days of showing up to the station and hoping there’s a train sometime soon. Please bring back the old app!!! | Please return to the old app where you could tap a line and tap a station. 

I don’t need to search for an address (and by the way why can you search for addresses outside of the MTA coverage area anyway) also why is the subway stop I’m trying to search for not the first result every time after just a few letters? If anything the UI of this app should just be a subway map or a list of subway lines followed by a list of stops on that line.

BRING BACK THE OLD APP. | This new update is beyond terrible. Requires user to click so many times before arriving to the information that was easily accesible in the last version. It’s not clean or easily manageable for someone that rides the subway everyday. I hope the developers take this feedback and revert back to the old one or create a more user friendly app. | App requires iOS 12.4 or higher but immediately crashes on my iPhone 6 running 12.5.7 (I can’t upgrade further until I get a new phone). | Who comes up with this hot mess?😡 | Not intuitive. Things are all over the place. Layout is confusing. Old app allowed me to see train times much quicker at a glance. Things were separated nicely. | I can’t stand this new version.  The previous version was so easy to navigate.  This new app I can appreciate the upgrade but this was a totally, completely, and new make-over and not easy to navigate.  I saw a senior at the bus stop yelling at their phone wondering what happened to their app.  I explained that the app went through a change.  That poor senior eventually asked the bus driver about the app and the driver couldn’t help much and directed them to call 511.  Put the old app back! | I am experiencing all the same issues echoed throughout the reviews. Where I was once able to click twice and find what I needed, I am totally baffled by the new app. I figured I needed to give it time and I’d acclimate, but I only use it when I need it (which, for me, is not daily) so I’ve forgotten how to use it subsequent times. When you have less than a minute to make transit decisions, the old app was a great tool. Now, for me, not so much. Also… it’s bonkers that I can use my phone browser to find more accurate information on BusTime.MTA.info than the app. My browser gives real time info while the official app gives me scheduled times (which are, at best, 30% correct?). I’ve missed or waited on buses that weren’t even coming due to this. As a designer I have empathy for the UX/UI side of this… it has to be hard to hear folks saying they keep trying to understand the app when it should be the most intuitive thing to use. | I don’t know what happened with the redesign. Made it harder to use and understand, especially the bus routes. | How does this keep getting worse every time they overhaul it? There should be minimal taps to get to the subway arrival times. And with each update they bury them further. Also for some reason the subway lines are laid out south to north by default which is the opposite of what it used to be and opposite what’s on the website. I’ve made mta.info a shortcut on my phone and just use that instead.  This app is a joke. | The live tracker is back but the old tracker before the update was easier to use.

The new live tracker seems slower to update, the bus is always between two stops it doesn’t tell you if the bus is at the bus stops

The old tracker will tell you when a bus is less then one stop away, approaching, and then at stop. The new tracker can only position itself between two different stops so it’s never tell you that it’s at stops, the icon  just jump from being between the pervious stops about to reach your stops and then it’ll jump to between the next stops. We seems to have lost the more precise tracking.
the next one is minor but prefer if the bus icon was a different color from the line it’s currently traveling down 
I’ll probably keep using the bus status website rather then the app | To revise an imperfect but usable app to something cumbersome and lacking value is an absolutely on brand move by the MTA.

One no longer opens the app and is greeting with the page you normally use. You have to do a bit of clicking to get to where you want to be.

Correct me if I’m wrong but it seems that there is no longer any real time information. One of given just a schedule of when trains might arrive. This defeats the entire reason for the app to exist. The schedule seems to be an abstract concept in general and certainly isn’t really helpful when you are deciding your route.

Dear MTA programmers, do better. | My app updated automatically and I wished it never did. The app used to show me bus and train times. Simple as that, that’s all I need. The new update looks nice, but is so confusing and makes no sense. I’m doing so much work finding my way around this app, still can’t find a simple answer to when my bus will arrive. | This new app doesn’t even have the same information as the old one. There’s no way to see planned service changes. The new status page layout makes it hard to see all the lines that have delays. It made way more sense grouped by status than by line. There are so many bad UX choices I’m seriously in shock. This app is so bad and it’s worse than what existed before. Bring back the old app, this one is a total joke. | The new version looks prettier but it is SO difficult to use. To find the time my train will arrive at a station I need to: click on my favorites, click on the train, click on the route, scroll through the WHOLE ROUTE including ANY stop that train CAN make stops at even when it usually doesn't, find my stop, and THEN I can see the time it's coming. This is an incredibly annoying and inefficient app. Please take the new design choices and apply them to the former layout!! | This app update is far worse than the old one. It is no longer possible to quickly jump to a subway line and station to see the train times and plan when to leave to grab a train. This now requires navigating twice  screens and scrolling. Th print is very fine and  screen very busy, further slowing things. Terrible UI. Please roll back to something cleaner, including the old one. Bus navigation sort of ok. | I can’t stand the new version of this app, not user friendly at all, so many unnecessary steps added. Bring back the old app for the love of god | Doesn’t even let you search the station. I get every other search but the station. Utterly terrible | Give us back the old version!! Like many other user have said it, the old version of the app had it simpler than current version!! | This app was fine, now it’s an absolute mess. Terrible. | I guess you need some “getting used to “ time. It still has occasional issue with accuracy in geolocation but overall, I’d say the app has improved. Still cautiously optimistic. | The new update makes it harder to find the information you need. Many more clicks and back and forth to find the bus times as compared with the previous version. If you haven’t updated yet I recommend you don’t | New update app is Garbage. Never right. 
Schedule never right. | It’s as of the Uk/ix designers had no experience at all.  This app is so much less usable than the last version.  MTA take note! | What a shifty update. Dont be proud, MTA and contractor, this new app is less usable. | Now that real time bus locations are back, the apps functionality is back to being what commuters need. I don’t agree with every visual change, but as always there is no way you could ever get everyone using an app like this with millions of customers on the same page.

I think some of the changes are for the better, I would personally prefer the old split for specific stops, where the top of the app was one direction and the bottom was the other, but I think that’s something that maybe confused people. I think overall the app is in a great place now. | When this App was initially updated , March 27, 2024. I gave it a 1 Star Review without giving it an opportunity to actually impress me with its changes. Now, a month later, I have gotten used to it, and it is EXTREMELY more helpful than before. This is a 5 Star App that has become more helpful than its original release. Great job. | Used to look worse but work better… Now it looks better but is so convoluted as to be a waste of time to even open. Horrible functionality. One wonders whether they had a single test user because nobody in the right mind would think this new layout was better or even close in functionality. | I like the old Mta app better than the new one this one is a mess to use | Bring back the old version!! We need an app that will easy information at the nick of time, too many steps to get to the information. Plus no service in the subway so it doesn’t load. | Way too many selection screens to get to the train/bus needed. By the time you do you’ve missed the oncoming train/bus. The app no longer finds your stop automatically through location which adds extra time to the search. It auto selects to the uptown direction which can be confusing. The countdown time and the time stamp often don’t match up which can be frustrating. Essentially it’s just become too  complicated for people living in a city that moves so fast. I appreciated that previously it would only take a few seconds to find a route... something I could do while multitasking. I feel like now I’m planning a road trip with multiple stops and I need to sit down and really pay attention to make sure I don’t get lost. | For me, this app went from daily use to never use in such a rapid period of time. The newly designed app is an unmitigated disaster. But what else would you expect from the MTA? | Times for arriving trains are often incorrect, changing often once the page is refreshed. The interface is confusing, with a lot of extra steps needed to find a station or train. | I reported that the app crashes upon launching and the following  reply was sent to me:

Thank you for your comment and we apologize for any inconvenience with the new update. You can report specific issues of this kind right in the app. In the ""More"" tab, tap the ""App Feedback"" button and follow the prompts.""

The. App. Crashes.  It does not open. | MTA got this right. The offline maps are greatly appreciated; i was having to make searches on the web/use bookmarks for them. And the new layout allows you to see all options at your current location at a glance. Favorites are still there, though oddly located under the “i” icon, and through that you can use “show route” to  see the lineup of stops as before. Trip Planner, given a street address, can suggest alternate routes you might not have thought of. Thanks, MTA! | Go back to the basics!! | Mostly the times being immaculate compared to other apps is my issue. Otherwise the app looks good not too hard to figure out as well. | The only useful feature on the entire app was the live train/bus feature.  No bus or train is ever on time. The schedule is a joke. Removing this feature makes the app garbage. Please put the feature back. | This app is so frustrating since the update. Traveling by bus, it’s so much more complicated to see where the bus is and sometimes it simply doesn’t show any buses even though they are coming.",1.7571,634,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f4/00/fa/f400fae6-b4c1-221f-e15e-8c67e39e8364/daa20293-dffb-42cd-a8e6-e93eb30cb4cc_Screen01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/db/df/42/dbdf42d7-f9a1-d21c-c682-0c632237f768/fb054c30-9835-4adb-95f2-ba07a2a2e422_Screen02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/14/df/47/14df47af-5f39-c6f3-b00f-a60c801c8a2a/a173c562-140a-41c2-ac6b-6312055d15a3_Screen03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/09/50/f7/0950f7bd-7f4b-841e-275f-834870ec2d3c/8fabd2d4-1879-49af-9133-23faf785c5dc_Screen04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3c/51/e2/3c51e251-af39-8816-1e05-1062d855cbf5/d84420b2-0451-4c5a-8f75-dd2d54d8ff79_Screen05.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/70/e0/5e/70e05ea1-8d27-67a7-5bfa-901c3f41b28a/a4554f0c-e4ae-4e0a-91a1-e729f159eec2_Screen06.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"
388686726,"com.mdv.MVVCompanion","MVV-App","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mvv-app/id388686726?uo=4","The MVV-App is a journey planning application created by the Munich transport association (Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund, MVV). It is both free of charge and without advertising. 

It provides travel information for the entire public transport network in the city of Munich and the surrounding regions (districts of Bad-Tölz Wolfratshausen, Dachau, Ebersberg, Erding, Freising, Fürstenfeldbruck, Miesbach, München, Rosenheim, Starnberg and the city of Rosenheim) – no matter whether you go by train, (sub)urban railways, underground, tram or bus. In many cases with real-time information. With the MVV-App you can also purchase selected MVV tickets with your smartphone or tablet on the go. Register once and you have the option to either buy the single trip tickets or you can choose to buy one of our day tickets for your stay in Munich. Besides, the MVV-App provides additional information on public transport in the entire Greater Munich Area, such as public transport and tariff maps as well as any changes in the timetables.

Features:
========

• Departures: The departure monitor indicates the next departures and/or arrivals from a stop or the stops in the neighborhood of your current location in real-time (where available). 

• Trips: The journey planner will help you to find the quickest route from A to B – in many cases with real-time information. Just enter the name of a stop, a point of interest or any desired address in Munich or the surrounding districts as your starting point or destination. With GPS you can also use your current location. The results include all footpath directions. The MVV-App also helps you buy the correct ticket for the selected journey. With just a few clicks you can purchase mobile tickets directly from the journey planner.

• Disruptions: At a glance, you can see disruptions that might affect your daily commute ordered by lines and their operation names. As yet, the descriptions of timetable changes are only available in German.   

• Tickets: With menu item “Tickets” you can purchase selected MVV tickets as mobile ticket. Register once within one of the listed shops (identical range of tickets) and choose your ticket before starting your journey. You can pay for your tickets by using Google Pay, a credit card or direct debit. As electronic tickets are personalized, you have to bring your official photo ID.

• Network plans: In addition, the MVV-App provides you with various public transport network plans and tariff maps. Although most of the plans are in German language, you can find several plans in English, too. For example: the general plan of the regional train, suburban train and underground in the entire MVV area.

• Interactive map: The interactive map does not just help you to come along in the MVV area.  You get access to further information such as nearby departures by using your GPS signal for example.

• Settings: If you choose the appropriate settings, you can for example avoid stairs during your trip or prefer less walking time over the quickest connection. In case you take a bike with you, the journey planner is able to take this into account too. You can also exclude connections not being integrated within the MVV tariff.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f7/a3/84/f7a38409-0dfd-15ad-a54a-35a5599cd7a5/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","139682816","14.5","2011-04-05T11:52:26Z","2023-12-20T08:13:51Z","Thanks a lot for your feedback.

Do Germans just like to suffer? | While getting controlled for my Ticket the app crashes. The controller then gave me a fine of 60€. Even if I’m able to show that I had the ticket it STILL COSTS money. This app needs to be pulled. | Since I updated the app, I can’t buy tickets and can’t use my existing stripe tickets. | Utterly complicated. Flow to buy and validate ticket hard to figure out. Remaining credits impossible to determine for multi stripe. I burned several credits by accident. Failed error messages happens and have to retry. However you can eventually get a ticket. Good app if you want to scream at your phone. | Layout looks great! Just can’t buy ticket or use it! Please fix! | Often won’t display tickets to buy.  Need to delete app and download and register again... and again… and again… Shame. | Unable to buy tickets after last update.  It says “no products please pull down…” regardless of which option you select. The app worked fine before this last update. | Credits can’t be used - uninstall and reinstall - logging in again - nothing makes the problems go away. This app is really bad. The old one should have been kept. It wasn’t pretty but at least it worked. Not enough bad things to say about the new app. | You could think the designers of this App make it on purpose so frustrating to use so that you go back to using your car. | I have not been able to buy tickets on this app for months. I would love to use it but it serves no purpose if I can’t buy tickets. | Wie soll denn jemand wissen welche Zonen man beim Ticketkauf kaufen muss???? Also wie leben doch hier nicht hinterm Mond - Benutzerfreundlichkeit = Zero! Völlig unverständlich | About two days ago, the app stopped offering Apple Pay as a payment option, leading me to being late as I had to find a Kartenautomat instead. This also means that I now need to store my card info MVV on the web app, which is extremely slow and un-user-friendly. I'll update the review once, and if, Apple Pay returns. 

Otherwise, the app works as advertised. | Not worth trying to install. Fails to load. Attempted 3 installs without success.

IOS 14.6. | The new app looks great, but on the eve of Wiesn, the English translations in the ticketshop have been removed. Not cool for people that were planning to use this app to get around Munich during Wiesn. | The other review is clearly from an American who doesn't understand public transport. Learn how things work before you start ignorantly judging them. The app works great and I have no problems with it. | After the last update I lost what ever credit I still have in the MVG shop. iPad version can’t be started. The management of this should be fired, together with the product management, test and verification team. Another worst I have ever seen. Where are the CEO and board who allow this to happened.

But it will happily trick you into thinking you have, at least until an inspector asks you to produce it. Then you find the truth: you can do a search for connections 10 months into the future, day, time and everything. But when you click ""buy"", the ticket they sell you is valid starting now--and expires in three hours.

This is incompetence verging on dishonesty. I'd think it was intentional, but everything else about the UI is so poorly thought out and executed, I guess the designers have just never met a human before.

Radar is dramatic snow and rain forecast with no precipitation in the forecast  in the timeline. | Waste of space and time. You can do your preferred weather app for better results. This doesn’t update as you travel. It showed partly sunny with chance for rain through Kentucky and Tennessee. It’s poured the whole time. We travel frequently from NW Ohio to NW Florida using I-65. No sun at all, just rain. If it refreshed better with traveling but it doesn’t. So use your map and compare with weather app for more accurate reading. I’m done using this app | I have used this app to plan road trips and have found it very useful. It will update the forecasts as you go. The forecasts are fairly accurate and the app is not cluttered with unnecessary information. Well done! | The UI can be clunky and it doesn't update perfectly as you drive. The location detection in real time needs some improvement, but it works and for now it's the only while-you-drive weather app! | This is a very important tool for me that my job so much easier by avoiding bad weather causing costly delays in my logistics business | The radar is accurate on the current day, but if you pick a future date, the radar doesn’t update/change.  Crap | I used this to help my daughter plan a lengthy trip and to keep tabs on her weather predictions as she drove. It is easy to use and was pretty accurate on the forecasts for driving 10 hours in one day. | I’ve use this app now for about six months, and it comes in really handy for anticipating weather on road trips. I really like the feature. Where you rest now, as it makes it much more usable for an entire trip. | This is very helpful and easy to use. Thank you! | Recently on an RV trip form CO to GA during the recent ice storm that hit from TX through AR. Using the app we stayed ahead of the storm so we missed driving on the treacherous roads. Very friendly app to watch the weather as we traveled. | For the last 14-years we have traveled from the West Coast to the Mid-South multiple times a year in two days. Initially we planned our trips using The Weather Channel. When they discontinued weather conditions for the US Interstates, planning a trip became more challenging. 

Sites like Road Now require too much interaction for each state and exit to determine weather conditions. So, when I located your website and mapped out our route along I-40, I was pleanstly surprised with the various filters one may use to receive the information needed. 

Based on the information provided, we planned our trip for yesterday and today. We are approximately 2-hours from our destination and this has not been a pleasant experience. 

The weather conditions we encountered were not predicted. In addition, I downloaded the App, thinking that we could monitor conditions easier on the road - Icould not have been more wrong!

For over 200-miles, the app and website did not register our location or, if it did, the forecast information was not available. Even as we were deak]ling with the challenging weather, the App and website did not indicate what we were experiencing. 

Needless to say, the App and Website Bookmark will be deleted after completing this review. This appeared to have so much potential but from someone who has extensive experience with this route, this was an epic failure. | Lately app crashes or freezes often. Useful app but design is very entry level. | this new update is stupid and the app is now useless | Useless. | Convenient when I travel back home to Iowa from Ohio, I always use this app to check the weather! | Before any major road trip we use this app for the weather on the roads we will be on.  Once it helped us to change our route before we left to avoid tornadoes. | I get a lot of good information on this app | I’ve used this for a couple of years going back and forth from Wi and Fl. Has always been accurate on best time to travel in order to hit the best weather available. | This app was Great at helping me miss traveling in storms!! I use it all the time!! I’m not sure if it tell us about fog but I hope so!!! | I have use this app for 3 East Coast to the West Coast and back again trips on motorcycle. This app provided important information to provide the best time to make my rides and keep me from bad weather, how fast to ride and when to ride to keep me out of dangerous thunderstorms that were traveling east to west. | I just paid to upgrade the app, which I’ve had had for many years. After using if for one hour the screen went white on me. I turned my phone off and back on.  Rebooted.  It will not work.  All I get is a white screen.  My other apps are working. | Planning for a 5 - 6 hour, multiple state motorcycle ride had me trying all the best reviewed apps in this category. I can’t say enough about how much better Highway Weather is in my opinion. 

Not only was I able to effectively choose a great route with better weather (someone in my party chose the “fast route” using another app and regretted it), but I experienced a subscription related issue and the response I received was so much faster than I expected and a fantastic interaction. 

If I could rate higher than 5 stars, I would! | I purchased this app because we’re moving cross country. It works ok. Not great. I had to purchase extra options. But that never works. Every time I close the app I have to refresh my purchase.  And I mean EVERY TIME! So very frustrating when you’re only checking the drive. | Hands down a killer app for planning road-trips. The UI is a bit wonky since there are so many variables at play (steps in your drive, time options for leaving)…but play around with it a bit. Living in NC and driving back to Ohio means I have to drive through WV mountains. This app helps me determine the best times to leave based on the weather | This app simply doesn’t work. No apparent way to move from choosing locations to actually seeing the weather. Touch anywhere and you get a link to another app, NOAH radar. Ads on the screen cover Next buttons. Totally frustrating waste of time. | We’re new to the RV world with our first Class B camper (Airstream Interstate) and commute 1,300 miles between homes.
Wind and winter weather are easy to avoid with this app.  You can plan ahead a week in advance to see hour by hour road conditions.  Requires a subscription but it’s money well spent! | It’s easy set speed count 11 hours then set start time 10 hours ahead for next days or days. Only thing is it locks up when I was paying for it. Kept wanting me to repurchase all the time | This is one of my favorite travel apps. I’m a solo RVer, and this app helps me know weather conditions, the best time to leave, and what the wind and precipitation will look like along each step of my journey. I’ve actually changed my route or left early because I know what the weather will be like along my way. Thanks for creating such a travel friendly app! | The plan ahead and drive now buttons don’t appear sometimes on the page . But other than that it’s the best drive app out there . I own a trucking company and we have used Highway weather consistently for years . I find it to be extremely accurate. Thanks | App does not work when using multiple destinations for a route. Just upgraded to premium and Drive Now and Plan Ahead buttons do not show after search. Latest version.

UPDATE:   Developer was very responsive and fixed the bug quickly.    The application now works as designed. | This app is great for plan your trip, I’m truck driver, this app help me a lot. Thanks developers!! | Have been using app for 6 months, flawless best indicator of future road conditions, its shows best time to leave and you can adjust departure times a1 app | I does what it says, and pretty darn accurate.. With this app, you should be surprised by weather along the way.. | I was testing the functions on this app. When I pressed an x in the lower left hand corner, the screen went black. I can not recover the app, delete it and reinstall it, nothing. Please review. | Wow, what did they do? Clicking Drive Now does nothing. | I did not purchase the app - only using the free version - but if I choose to travel now it shows me a screen that lets me purchase it. If I decline, the app does nothing | I really appreciate this app as a frequent roadtripper and regular all-weather truck camper. Helps me navigate and choose routes wisely across time and space, when to go, when to stay, and easily allows smart decision-making with detailed info along routes. Thanks! | Must have especially when traveling long distances during possible bad weather months.  Traveled from Michigan to Florida and back during the winter months.  With this app I was able to determine the best times to travel and avoid bad weather and roads.  Great app!! | I am very disappointed in the mis app doesn’t give the information I expect and the travel time isn’t accurate | This app is great for long trips in the winter. | Doesn’t work when you use zip codes ... | The app advertises it has travel routes with current road conditions and that is false! Even using the paid version, it does not work! If I could give lesser than 1-star, I would. | Needs a lot more work | When traveling, especially when pulling a travel trailer.  We need to be able to see if there are high winds and what those wind gusts will be.  We have often changed our leave time based on weather along the route.  This is a great app. | This is a must-have app for anybody who travels on the road.  Whenever I go on roadtrips, I use this app to make sure I will safely get there and conveniently have the weather I want on my journey.  
The app looks a little beta, but I think it’s really all you need. So much potential in this app. But no other app is like this app. | Love this app for planning long rides it’s pretty accurate with what I can expect traveling  and gives a snapshot of the weather in cities along the way. | No good...doesn’t follow your location. Also, I tried the free trial and kept asking for subscription each time.  No good | I used this app to plan our departure date when we decided to drive cross country instead of fly during the pandemic. Probably the best free app I have ever used. It helps to really think about your trip and add way points with realistic pause times. I adjusted my route along the way and the weather was always spot-on. | We have been a motorcyclist for 35+ years and travel about 18K per year on two wheels. I have said to friends I have been waiting for this app my whole riding career. Nothing in weather prediction is perfect but this app gives excellent predictions and makes my road travel easier and SAFER! I highly recommend the product! | Horrible app. Can’t o diddly squat without paying and can’t see enough of tyke functions to know whether it’s worth buying.

During an era of distractions and buried commitments, Foresyte is on a mission to enable friends everywhere to stay connected when planning the moments that matter together.

Discover. Plan. Do.


TESTIMONIALS
My friends and I do a lot of traveling for powwow season and, being like a giant family reunion already, it can be CRAZY trying to coordinate everyone with places, times, and pooled funds. We used to “volunteer” someone to play point person for the group and be in charge of making sure everyone was on the same page and all registration fees have been covered…but this app has made EVERYTHING so much easier, even when we’re all in different parts of the country trying to meet up at an event. Easy to use and fun, it’s like it’s own festival on my phone. And we’ve found the coolest places we would’ve never checked out if Foresyte hadn’t recommended - highly recommend.
- Michelle Collins

I downloaded Foresyte a couple months ago and this app is solid. Me and my friends just used it to plan our trip through Europe earlier this month and it worked great. Group chat inside of the trip itinerary is such a great concept
- steve s

Foresyte seems like the type of app that could become an everyday essential. Very clean interface and rich set of features.
- KevinKeef

My bro asked me to plan his bachelor party and his friends are kinda flaky. This definitely helped me pull everyone together for the travel weekend.
- Ruby4401

I travel frequently between work and personal trips. Foresyte is a great way to manage my travel calendar apart from the 1000 other meetings listed on my work calendar
- ChrisW

As someone who travels a lot I've always wanted a better way to visualize my schedule. This app solves the problem of needing to check various sources to pull together upcoming group trip plans on our bucket list.
- MiniMom

I have been needing some way to plan for all my trips coming up and I’m so excited to have found this app. I can fully enjoy the moment because I'm financially ready for it. Love the new updates too! Makes it so easy to use now. The perfect trip planner

Me and my friends just traveled through Europe and this made it way easier to map out the plans together. Also the group chat connected to your itinerary is dope. Check it out | Your app is big fat fake and liars | I’ve deleted and redownloaded, tried multiple times over a few months, it allows me to log in but when it asks for my number on the next page there’s no way to advance, no enter button (newest iOS 14 pro max phone) | I’ve designed some of the biggest apps in the world and can confidently say you badly need to hire a designer. It’s terribly designed - onboarding needs to be split up. Drop the weird shadows, gradients, etc. Opening directly to a form is horrible for onboard - and then the form fields don’t have autocomplete enabled. Really really needs a designer 😅😅

The performance of the app is also unbearable. Everything lags. My hunch is that you used a subpar, cheap/outsourced engineer who used something like Flutter. It was an unfortunate choice 😭😭 | This app made little sense to me. I decided that see what it was about and see what recommendations it would offer. I didn’t dive TOO much into it as I couldn’t mentally get past the fact whenever you wanted to see what a location had to offer, it forwarded you to a trip advisor website on your internet browser. That just didn’t make sense. It seemed to be marketed as an app where you can host a group chat and plan a vacation to a location with and collaborate ideas with one another, and maybe you can, I just didn’t get to it because having to go to trip advisor was a mental pain for me. | I’ve been using Foresyte for a few months now, and it just keeps getting better and better. I absolutely love the little pop up’s that guide you through adding a new adventure. The organizational aspects of the app are great - I’m usually the coordinator of my group, and being able to share everything, get feedback and plan activities together makes things so much easier. It truly is an all-in-one for group trips and adventures. | ‼️really fácil app to navigate and get to what you need whether that be flights , stays , itinerary, in app group chats doesn’t matter | I feel overwhelmed with the thought of organizing the details for travel. This platform helps you see more options in an organized way. I recommend. | I'm the planner of my group and nothing stresses me out more than having to remind everyone about the same thing 20 times over again. Group chat inside of the trip itinerary is SO smart. I'm excited to see where this app goes next. | Love the budget part of this app!! Really puts things down on paper getting everyone’s input planning a multi family vacation for next summer so glad to have found this app!! | My girlfriend and I have a busy season of weddings and golf tournaments coming. We starting using foresyte recently and it’s really taken stress out of knowing what plans we have and missing out on events on the itinerary. Please download this if you’re like me and need direction when planning travel or even simply your week! | It has good recommendations of places to be at wherever you are. You can plan trips with family and friends and also budget right away. Gives you great deals and suggestions for places to stay as well that will be suitable for your budget. And if your an influencer, it has referral link that you can use and earn will you enjoy the app as well. 
And you can also suggest hidden gems(places) , that you like with the app and other users as well 👍🔥 worth downloading 🤩 | is app has AMAZING features, they are a great company very helpful and responds very quick . i’m loving foresyte ! | This app is great for planning trips with friends of family. I also love the ability to budget within the app among people coming on the trip. I think it is also great that the app gives suggestions on things to do in your desired travel location. Lastly, the app is super easy to navigate and use which is a plus!!! | Terrible interface, glitchy, purposeless, awful. It’s hard to describe how impossible this app is the use. I don’t know anyone who would use this app more than once. I’m my opinion it does nothing, and it crashes within 30 seconds and freezes on whatever screen you’re on. Don’t download! You’ll never use it! | My friends and I do a lot of traveling for powwow season and, being like a giant family reunion already, it can be CRAZY trying to coordinate everyone with places, times, and pooled funds.  We used to “volunteer” someone to play point person for the group and be in charge of making sure everyone was on the same page and all registration fees have been covered…but this app has made EVERYTHING so much easier, even when we’re all in different parts of the country trying to meet up at an event.  Easy to use and fun, it’s like it’s own festival on my phone.  And we’ve found the coolest places we would’ve never checked out if Foresyte hadn’t recommended - highly recommend. 🙌🙌 | UPDATE:

They added a bunch if fake recent reviews. The UX needs a TON of work. All the “good” reviews are clearly fake. The design is poorly made and it’s extremely confusing and cumbersome to use. This app serves no purpose. | My partner and I downloaded Foresyte and have been using it to plan our upcoming honeymoon to Bali. It’s helped us be able to collab on our itinerary and plan our budget. That trip pricing information is super convenient btw! | As someone who plans a lot events with friends, I use this app all the time for organization. The updated travel planner is very useful, I love exploring possibility of new cities and prices! | This app has lots of great features and can be use for just about all parts of every day life. Its great for planning trips and managing my finances over time. I was pleasantly surprised! | This app is dope | UPDATE to my update: Turns out that the developer is blanket commenting on all low reviews that a former employee no longer works there and if this changes our feedback. Firstly, READ THE FEEDBACK - most reviews you replied to with that generic message didn’t even mention him! They mentioned actual problems with the app. We didn’t give you a bad review because of KW, he overhyped a basic and underdeveloped app and we all downloaded it and realized it sucked - people even let you know what they felt was missing. The issues with app go way beyond that former employee.

UPDATE: I got a message from the developer insinuating that my negative review was based in the community backlash against a former employee. This is not the case - the app looks cheap and none of the free features were enough to keep me around. The graphics are subpar and over all the app looks like something out of the early 200s MySpace era. Was expecting so much more 

ORIGINAL: This app is TERRIBLE. The formatting, the user interface, everything seems incomplete and outdated. Also, most of the features that are being hyped up on other platforms are PAID features. With how annoying it was to navigate the free NO WAY was I going to pay for anything | You can do nothing on this app because it is extremely sensitive and won’t let me finish writing down anything and constantly bumps me out of a page I am looking at. I just want to delete my account and I am not sure how to because it allows bumps me. Please fix this problem because it extremely irritating and annoying. | App is pointless. All it is is a glorified calendar. Not worth the money because you need a subscription | Terrible app | I like the idea of having a group calendar/itinerary with the in-app Venmo(that feature is actually cool) but it ends up being  another calendar I have to manage. 

No integration with third-party calendars is kind of lame. With other calendars I can message others and edit without leaving the app. With this I can’t send messages when I make changes.  

Note for dev: Add a way to integrate third party calendars like google calendar, slack, teams, etc. for premium users. You’ll see usage skyrocket. Trust me bro. | Didn’t find it useful. | Rushed app! Not worth it | You should be told that this app requires a lot of personal information. | The app is objectively and figuratively bad. It’s very buggy- there’s a 90% chance it’ll crash immediately after you open the app. I became increasingly confused the more I explored the app and it’s features. You are better off sticking to the travel planning and financial planning services you already use and are familiar with than going through the mental gymnastics of trying to navigate this god forsaken app. Anything this app claims to do could be done a lot easier and for free by using google drive, Microsoft share point, Venmo, etc. | App is rough. Freezes at every turn and is pointless. Who thought of this app? I think they need to go back to high school. | Very simple but very broken. It feels like an app made for a middle school project. The ui looks like it is from 2009. Some features are behind a paywall or just plain broken. Honestly, just stay away from this dumpster fire. | Not user friendly and consufing to use. | Very clunky feeling app but it’s being shared everywhere on TikTok. I can easily just do this via text or another platform that doesn’t collect data. | This is one of the most confusing and non-intuitive travel apps I’ve ever attempted to use. And even though it’s founders like to advertise it being free, you basically can’t do anything without purchasing additional features. | I was disappointed because the app feels very basic and most of the advertised features are not included in the free version. If I wanted to look for hotels I had to buy the subscription. I would not recommend this app, there are plenty of free versions you can use instead. | Please do not use this app without reading through the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When a company is collecting this much data on its users I expect more than a “trust me bro” privacy policy. “We don’t sell your data - we only share it with our business investors” Then disclose what is shared, who it is shared with and any terms of use. | This app was rushed. Messy interface. A ton of issues with it. | App has nothing to offer. $3 monthly subscription and the app collects wayyyyy too much data. Stay away | Great concept ! And solid UX | I’m using this app to support Ken, because I appreciate those who help others! Good luck and I will be planning future events and trips using this app | Makes planning less stressful and happy with the ease. | Great way to share an itinerary with friends! | App is confusing. Got stuck in a screen, not intuitive | Remarkably easy to use. Helped me budget and plan my excurision to London | As someone that travels a lot I’ve always wanted a better way to visualize my schedule. This app solves the problem of needing to check various sources for all my upcoming plans! Super convenient! | Time to start planning. | I really like how the app can track trips but being able to add certain expenses to certain days each month is crucial. Each week expenses are different so the month clump expenses doesn’t really work for an overall budget app. If they would add this ability, this app would be amazing.",4.20767,313,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/61/08/65/61086511-ad33-3c26-1df4-f57b1c4ee50f/1ae77ab1-f48d-4944-9ce2-189538d325d6_Frame_1__U002819_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/d2/e2/ab/d2e2ab7a-8192-4174-371b-b22429be7beb/9ee20c51-2e1d-44ca-a518-bab26f79b403_Frame_2__U002823_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/a8/4f/a3/a84fa3ec-a527-eb6f-c2bd-0f2338a118ab/ee8f1ba4-22af-443b-a30c-6e1163eabaa8_Frame_3__U002829_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/76/4a/08/764a08f3-07b9-b805-4a11-83e697a57dab/9237137c-5dab-4ceb-a942-615979e51708_Frame_4__U002816_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/b0/7c/c4/b07cc4e6-2df9-3cc5-3ec0-4311387609bc/2303d07a-1a97-4950-a6c8-ea41baa3dd7e_Frame_5__U00288_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/b4/33/fd/b433fd24-3d22-ace7-7421-40994d6304a7/f5d7f5d9-90d7-4db9-8b2e-3cd385fa4c7e_Frame_6__U002826_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/3c/73/59/3c7359ad-114e-27fe-38c3-452e1acdd73b/77c82c9e-fe2b-42d8-ab77-30719ef26203_Frame_7__U00289_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/8c/52/94/8c5294fe-3135-20d3-b12b-9fdf28eb40d9/cf91362e-e8de-432c-a9e7-3466c4b7a370_Frame_8__U002816_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/10/23/ee/1023ee7c-87f1-f47b-38ee-7988b813d106/5f017a45-8cbe-4e01-b1c7-c8cd8909f45d_Frame_8__U00281242X2208_U0029__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/f8/f6/b8/f8f6b8ad-964d-d862-a66d-57e85753176e/934c7bde-90e2-4d7c-bf18-0c14860258b2_Frame_10__U00281242X2208_U0029__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

No intention to share more private information, by registering another address. Scam!!! | Navigation in this magical city made easy with this app. | So nice to have an offline map and info for places where data use is pricey. My only complaint is the difficulty of navigating through the app. Wish there was a ‘back’ button on each page. | Offline features are great when we don’t have internet overseas! | We’re going to Venice this summer and I’m hoping the offline map will help.  My understanding is that everyone gets lost in Venice!  Wish me luck!  If I can remember I’ll write another review when I return. | Using for planning trip thanks so much | Very helpful !! | I like that I can save places I want to visit-share it with everyone. Love it | Thanks | The app worked great points of intest,churches all found easy | Got all info abt European cities and east to travel without any hiccups | I used this app consistently for a month while staying in Venice and it did a great job of helping me to orient myself and navigate a complex city. It’s not perfect (hence the 4 stars), but it is better than any other offline map that I tried for comparison and it is far better than trying to get around Venice with an unwieldy foldout paper map that cannot tell you where you actually are. | So very extremely useful app, was invaluable on our trip. Highly recommended. | PLEASE DO NOT TRAVEL VENICE WITHOUT THIS APP. I cannot thank this app enough to make my Venice trip so smooth . It is your walking GPS for Venice , it took away the tension of getting lost in Venice lanes. Must download the maps on your iPhone. | I anticipated being able to connect to wifi more often than I actually did, and many times the wifi that was available was extremely slow! Having this map saved me over and over again when I was lost in the streets of Venice- which even locals admit to! Cell service is not cheap anymore, costing $10/day per phone (with AT&T) so it was great to be able to save points of interest before my trip then have the ability to find it with the offline map! | The best application to use in Venezia | Utile complète | We took a family vacation with ages of kids ranging from 3-22 and this application helped us get around and schedule across our broad interests. | This app is very easy to use, and the list feature helps build and organize trips.  We lost one day in Venice, but I was able to use my list and the map to adjust ur trip and get the most out of the day we had.  The Wikipedia functions are ok, but I got great value by combining with my Fodor's guide. | Venice is a walking city. Google maps does not support those on foot and lacks detail. This was a great app to get us around the city. | I love this app and we haven't traveled yet. I am able to see all the places we want to go. It will help plan what to do at sites that are together. I even found some new sites based on the articles!!

I wasn't thrilled with the upgrade. Maps looked different so I downloaded the app for the individual cities. Rome, Venice and Paris. | By any standard, Venice is a difficult city to navigate, but is a great city to get lost in. This app WAS the difference between being ""hopelessly lost"" and ""pleasantly lost"". Highly recommend for first time visitors to Venice. | This is a Godsend app for me as a tour guide. | I mainly loved this app because it can be used offline, and gps will position you on the map. | Venice is maze like no other city in the world. This app gets you through it. I love this app. It works great when the phone was off line so it didn't use any of my limited cellular data budget.  Accurate and user friendly. Used Ulmon maps in three cities with equally good results in each | There are a few things missing for the map for example my hotel but great for finding all the sites | Get this if traveling to Venice, great map where no internet is required. | Spent a week in Venice staying in an apartment.  Needed a good offline map and information about sights, and the Ulmon Venice information was spot on, used it more than any other Venice app on the trip. | Could not have made it around Venice without this app!! | Get it, don't hesitate another second! It was a life saver on our trip and helped us enjoy our vacation without getting frustrated with Venice's labyrinth.  All the streets there look so beautiful and so alike that I think Venice is nearly impossible to navigate with a paper map - it's extremely confusing.  This app can save your vacation! | The fact that I could download the map to my phone ahead of time was perfect as I did not have international service. I could still use my Venice Ulmon whenever I wanted and not need wifi or to carry a paper map. The direction of travel arrow is also very helpful. | This was one of the best and most useful apps I have ever used.
I did not want to carry one of those huge bulky maps in Venice so decided to use the offline map for my trip. This thing was my bible, it shows direction of traffic so you know if your going the right way, has great suggestions for places to see and eat, and has a map of the metro. The offline function still is able to triangulate your location and direction you are facing and walking so it is impossible to get lost with this app. Best part about it is if you set a marker on the map, even without gps you can easily see how you are walking to the set marker. I can only imagine that this app would be even more amazing if I decided to use it online.
Really can't imagine it getting better then this app, not one thing I would change about it. | Usually don't rate apps but after a trip to Europe using this offline maps, I can asure you, this app will make your trip easier and you won't miss any important spot in the city. I used London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Rome, Florence, Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon! In Budapest I felt lost because they don't have a map for this city but Google also doesn't have a map for Budapest offline. 
I'll put 6 stars but I can't so 5 it's the closest. One more thing, all this is for FREE! And this is not all, also you can download the information about the historic places in the city and then you can get the info offline. 
You have to try it!! | Excellent offline app with accurate GPS to tour Venice - we never got lost!  Great recommendation for restaurants and attractions! Have been downloading this app for every destination that we have traveled to! | Full of ads.  Always trying to link you to another site.  Just trying to get you to buy! buy! buy!.  Not worth it. | Used this for two days navigating the streets of Venice. Invaluable. | Great app! A must for navigating Venice. Worked great! | I down loaded this befor my trip, and was lucky I had. Was off line most of the time while walking around the city. If it wasn't for this app I would still be walking the streets trying to find my way. The city has very poor signs and this was a wonder aid for me to use OFF LINE. Thanks. | I downloaded the Ulmon app for each city I visited in Italy. It was indispensable!! All information was available offline & I could never be truly lost because of the location feature. The Rome app included transit maps; I wish the Florence & Venice apps included the same. Other than that oversight, they were perfect! | Very useful for our recent trip to Venice ! | Will be able to add more after our vacation later this year.    So far have located the places we want to visit while on tour. | My map is full of pins!  It is more than likely the only map I'll need in Italy. Fingers crossed!  ;) | Excellent maps and item identification. Highly recommend! | Like the fact that this map has better street detail than most offline options. It even beats the Trip Advisor in this regard. | I wrote a ""disappointing "" review quite awhile ago. I've changed my mind completely!!  I used it to research for a recent trip to Venice. I found places I wanted to see outside the typical tourist areas, and I used it as reference on my phone for directions, etc (one important thing - directions to our hotel!!!). | Helpful and easy to use! | so far so good | Looks like it can help me a lot on my trip. | Helped us to walk in Venice in off-line mode.",4.73529,68,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/41/84/54/418454bb-167f-3ee5-678b-1baa01d0ae7c/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/cb/fa/28/cbfa2868-dfca-35e2-0386-f91668379053/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/0f/c6/5f/0fc65f4b-3bbc-7aa9-3c43-26d3463231e1/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/d3/df/9b/d3df9be1-3179-84ef-eb38-208599f3a8cd/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/af/f1/96/aff196fa-a2be-457c-f5c7-72a80873a35b/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/77/da/69/77da69a8-ffac-7aed-5d18-714cf1d3634d/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/64/bd/1f/64bd1f6a-43ad-3621-ae0d-d0e248ff94ea/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/b2/c7/67/b2c767b3-0f11-440e-730a-05986233c93a/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/6e/9d/b8/6e9db84c-c1c9-3f21-e0cc-41454ccc4553/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/2d/a7/29/2da729f5-c80d-285a-4f8e-68020ac87287/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Schengen Simple answers the key question that other apps don’t:
What is the maximum I can travel for, on any date, whilst ensuring I can still go on ALL my planned trips, never breaking the 90/180 rule?

To illustrate what makes Schengen Simple unique: say you have a trip next week and another in 2 months, and you want to add another trip in between. With Schengen Simple, you’ll know exactly how long that trip in the middle could be without causing an overstay. No other calculator can do this.

Other calculators can only tell you if a trip fits in with the trips that came BEFORE it. They are just counting the trips in the past 180 days. Schengen Simple’s algorithm is smarter, always looking forwards and backwards, ensuring ALL your plans are compatible.

Most other apps' calculations are misleading. Even apps which claim to account for future trips don’t really, which is why they overestimate your allowance.

>Trust your calculator

Here’s a simple test you can do to choose the right app for you.

Enter a 90-day trip in the calculator you’re testing. Now check the allowance for the days leading up to this trip; most will say you have an allowance of 90 because they’re only looking backwards. This is wrong, as we know you are already committed to the 90-day trip you just entered. The correct allowance should be zero for the 90 days preceding this trip. Other apps will incorrectly display that you have a 90-day allowance, and then when you try to enter a trip, will complain you’re causing an overstay - which we find frustrating.

The above example is simple as there is only one trip. As you enter more trips of varying lengths, we need to account for many interacting 180-day windows.

This is what makes Schengen Simple unique - it handles this instantly and accurately.

You’ll always know how long you can travel whilst ensuring you can still take every trip in your calendar.

>Features

• No need to nominate a date of entry, Schengen Simple analyses all your past and future trips, instantly updating your allowance for your entire calendar. Making it fast, easy and accurate to plan your travels.

• Never worry about having enough allowance to take your future trips. Always know how long you can travel, on any date, whilst ensuring you can still take your planned trips.

• Passport Control mode displays exactly how long you’ve been in the Schengen Area in a given 180-day period.

• Seeing your allowance under each date in your calendar gives full visibility of when your allowance changes so you can make smarter decisions about when to travel. Often if you wait a few days, you’ll get an increase in your allowance. Only Schengen Simple lets you see this at a glance.

• Allowance Analysis - easily probe why your allowance is what is for a given date, so you know which trips you could edit to stay longer.

• The Schengen Simple algorithm has been tested rigorously, so you can fully trust its calculations. This includes rigorous testing against the official EU calculator.

• Clear, simple and easy to use - even calculators deserve beautiful design.

>Pricing

Get started with a 1week free trial, after which an annual subscription gives you full access to all features - prices vary by country.

As a frequent traveler to the EU, this has been a godsend! | As a citizen of the US who travels many times a year to the EU, often for unpredictable and long stretches of time, this app is essential for my planning and essential for my sanity. In a nutshell, it works perfectly, and erases the stress and uncertainty of doing the 90/180 calculations manually. However, I must also say a word about the design and UI: This app is so elegant, so polished, so aesthetically gorgeous in its simplicity that I show it to all my designer friends and colleagues. The user interface is intuitive to the point where I was using it fluently within seconds. Likewise, the homepage shows you all the information you need to know immediately in a simple and attractive layout. Frankly, it’s as if they hired Massimo Vignelli as their creative director. Everything you need, nothing you don’t. *This* is how you design an app. | As Americans cruising long term in Europe on our sailboat, we tried setting up our own excel tracker/planner.  The 90-day limit in a rolling 180-day timeframe seems simple enough, and I’m pretty good at excel.  Simplicity goes away as soon as you start adding future stops, in and out of Schengen countries — too many levels of nested date-range and if-then-else functions to bother with, when one is on a travel adventure!  
This app has made planning so much easier! | I am a US citizens that purchased my retirement home in France and have been going back and forth to do renovations. I was not sure what the 90/180 rule restrictios were.  It can be all very confusing as well as the serious consequences if you ""overstay""
I initially thought is was per calendar year...and thanks to this App...I could have violated my chances of re-entering!
I wrote to this App for help since It was a little confusing when initially starting the process of entering the information when I was not sure of my travel date allowance and whether I did everything correctly.  I received a personal  reply immediately with help and instructions.  In addition George personally helped me re-work the dates and saved me by making me realize I would have overstayed my days for my next upcoming trip.  It will definely be a handy App for future qualifying  ""safe travel dates"".  Thank you George! | This App is a terrific find. It simplifies the very complex 90/180 debacle and makes it easy to determine remaining days and it pinpoints when the new 90 is available. It is well organized and proffessional. It also has a lot of other useful information about the Shengen area. It is worth having. | We retired and travel to Europe 2-3 times per year.  This app is critical to timing our trips and remain “Schengen legal”.  It retains our historical travel so we don’t have to enter it every time we use a Schengen calculator.  It also shows the number of days we have left at different times which is critical to planning trips.  It’s simple to use and it works. | I’m planning a multiple months, possibly couple years trip to Europe, and the app is very helpful for me to figure out when I need to be leaving the Schengen area and when I can return again. | We’re spending a lot of time in the EU these days & this app has been very helpful to determine how many days we have left in the Schengen or will have left with potential trips. It’s user-friendly and customer service was prompt and polite. | Really love this app as someone who travels to and from Europe all the time. The key functionality that sets this tool apart is the iCloud sync, and the predictive ability to let you know how days you can stay in a future trip and if you will be overstaying.

Lastly, the developers are incredibly helpful - George Cremer was able to pinpoint a bug in the app and release a fix in less than 24hrs. | As a US citizen with a home in the States and one in Europe, planning trips to Europe without overstaying the 90 Day Visa rule got a lot simpler with the Shengen Simple app.

As well as being eaiser to plan, the app helps to visualize and summarize time spent at the second home.  

It is great that past, present and future trips are retained in the app for easy reference and doing ""what if"" scenarios when a supper good airfare across the pond becomes available. | Best app I have found. I would like to see the ability for multiple accounts - e.g. for my wife and I - which I understood is on the features roadmap. I’d also like greater data security with a logon of some kind. | Great app that does the calculation in a very clean and visually easy way.  Love the passport control quick view.  Made it easy to see everything in one place if you ever get questioned!

This math is not easy to simulate in spreadsheets, don’t waste your time like I did. Then almost get caught starting over the 90/180 period.  Get this app!  They developer is very responsive to explain if you don’t understand the outcome.  This saved me!

iPhone app is great and development is ongoing vs many other apps I found stagnant. | I hate these apps! Maybe it is me, but “in app purchase”, used to mean extras or premium versions. Here it means the app itself. Nothing works until you buy the app, and then you get a 7 day trial. I don’t know how hard it would be to get refunded, because I went to different apps. | I like the easy calendar functionality and ability to predict future days/limits. Very useful. | This app is super helpful to me when I plan my travels to Europe! | I’ve been traveling in and out the Schengen area in the last 3 years and also visiting all those countries who follow the “90/180” rule. few times I’ve encountered border agents who don’t understand how the EU rule works. when you have several entries is a bit difficult to understand and the rule can be interpreted in different ways. I’ve tested this app in several scenarios and the results are perfect and accurate. awesome tool. great team and support. highly recommend. | I've tested it, and it's extremely useful and you can fully trust the results. It really helped me solve a significant problem understanding and planing my trips. I highly recommend it to all travelers, many other countries also are using the 90/180 EU rule. The support of the team is amazing. Thank you! | This app helps me plan and record my trips to Europe when I usually stay for 2 to 3 months per visit. | I was initially confused since the results didn’t seem to match those in the EU Calculator. The difference and saving grace of this app is that future trips are included in the app's calculations (unlike the EU calculator). This ensures that you can’t overstay and can’t jeopardise your future plans. The Schengen Rule is not so simple, but the app’s ability to enable future planning and give early warning of impending overstays makes it much simpler. The team there was really helpful in answering my questions. | This app is brilliant, it helped me understand the 90/180 rule and the complicated reset date, so I do not overstay. I am a frequent traveler to Europe and even understanding who is in Schengen and who is not has helped me figure out how to stay out of trouble. | We are American and going back and forth planning a move to Portugal. This app has been such an important part of our life the past year. Very well made and easy to use. | We looked at a few tools for planning time at our holiday home in Mallorca and found Schengen Simple to be the best on the market. Key for us is the ease with which we can accurately forward plan multiple trips and know we are staying within the limits. It’s easy to use, shows everything clearly and for us is good value for money! | The team is extremely helpful of you have questions and it’s pretty easy to navigate once you get started. | This app saves me a lot of calculations every time I hop the pond | I’ve tried them all and this Schengen calculator is the best! It is intuitive and the way it visually displays the days you have remaining is fantastic. | This is the best Schengen tool available. Do yourself a favor and start using this now. | I appreciate being able to glance at the calendar and being able to see how many days I have left in my Schengen allowance and on what date I roll back to 90 days.
