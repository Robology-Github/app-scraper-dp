You see the total price with no surprises about cost when you get to your hotel. It even lists options the hotels have in LasVegas if you want to pay extra for services so read those carefully BEFORE you book. And remember the hotel almost always puts a extra deposit on your card when you check in so call the hotel and ask if you are on a tight budget. I have traveled from LA to NY using this app and have even checked pricing when sitting in a hotels parking lot so it‚Äôs a great tool when traveling or just looking for a local hotel. | Booking.com is a great place to book your stays. They are 100% above board! | Muy limpio excelente camas el desayuno bueno el personal muy agradable . | Lost our booking and we kept calling and they would hang up on us.  Had to go to bank and report fraud because we weren‚Äôt able to get into our room!! We tried to cancel our booking and we put in the confirmation number they emailed us after we payed and it said ‚Äúthis confirmation number doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù Got scammed almost $700!! | Cute little duplex! Great space, appreciate the laundry pods,dryer sheets,coffee,creamer,sugar,comfortable beds, quick response,less than 10
Minutes to stores. Will definitely be rebooking this place! | Wonderful get away for Spring Break! Beautiful ranch ‚Ä¶ just what we needed to relax ,rewind and reflect! Shirt drive to Fredericksburg shopping and restaurants. Our girls loved watching out for the deer. Definitely will stay again. The casita accommodated our family of 4. Thank you Amy for being a wonderful host! | We were ahead of schedule and were able to check in early with zero hassles.  The manager was a one woman reservation clerk and housekeeper and we appreciated her knowledge of the area and hospitality.  After checking out she allowed us to leave our vehicle parked at the motel while we explored the area and base with our son (a Marine stationed here and the reason for our visit). The rooms were cozy, tidy, and clean with all the amenities we needed for a short visit to the area.  We will stay here again the next time we're in town! | Awesome!!!!!üëçüèø | Terrible terrible and more terrible will not stay there again. No towels no wash rags no good channels on tv. No good breakfast like they advertise. Bugs on Cellian not enough toilet paper. Bathroom sink nasty. Would not recommend staying here mold on cellian as well. | Room was very exceptional and clean with a very nice view. Thank you | üëç | This app has disappointed me for the last time. Every time we book somewhere and we have problems with the hotel, booking.com has not been helpful at all! I paid 190 dollars for a room where the staff was rude and my daughter was going to have to sleep on the floor and neither the property nor booking.com care enough to apologize or give me a refund. They offered $27 back out of $190, which is absolutely absurd! Then they tell me to look myself for a surrounding hotel to stay, which I already know are all booked up, instead of just giving me a full refund on somewhere I‚Äôm not even going to stay the night at! | I have to I have found the Hidden Gem of Collage Station. As soon as you open the doors it‚Äôs like you stepped into a dream. From outside you would never guess what awaits you on the inside. Customer service was the best I have ever gotten at any hotel. Ever kind and caring souls will great you here. And the had so much character to it. Beautiful wooden trunks for extra storage. The room was very clean and smelled amazing. And the court yard is to die for. I will never stay at another hotel ever when in College station. | C‚Äôest mon accompagnateur du voyage partout dans le monde entier..et toujours √† la hauteur merci √† toute l‚Äô√©quipe de bookingü•∞ | It has worked well for me for many years. | Returning from a cruise and was allowed to check into our room very early!..front desk greeted us with a warm smile and warm cookies‚Ä¶used the shuttle service going to the airport!‚Ä¶ what a nightmare‚Ä¶driver didn‚Äôt speak and drove very aggressively, told him we were traveling by Jet Blue was let out at Miami airport..and had to walk with our luggage, literally all the way to the other end of the airport, should have used Uber..and gotten better treatment‚Ä¶‚Äùdon‚Äôt use the shuttle services will frustrate your travels way too early in the morning | Great place to stay relax and enjoy nature with peace and tranquility! Really loved the place and surroundings.
Thank you for making this a pleasant stay! Would be ideal for a group of friends to spend the weekend! | Good luck | ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ | This was our first time in Paris. The staff was wonderful. They were very accommodating and helped us find wonderful places to eat. We have close access to the Metro. When we stayed there was a garbage strike, but our hotel was still able to take care that our garage did not pile up. | I have been using Booking.com App in almost all of my travel abroad, and honest it makes things easier for me. | The place we visited was ideal. They went above and beyond to fulfill our requirements and shared additional details that truly touched us. I enthusiastically recommend this destination to anyone planning to explore Valle de Guadalupe. | Compr√© un vuelo con ellos, quiero cambiar la fecha del vuelo y me quieren cobrar EL MISMO PRECIO QUE SALE UN PASAJE COMO SI LO ESTUVIERA SACANDO HOY MISMO. 
Compr√© un pasaje de usd 365 y me quieren cobrar usd 444,67 para cambiarlo. 

Con usd 444,67 puedo comprar un pasaje nuevo hoy mismo. NO TIENE SENTIDO
NO ME BRINDARON OTRA SOLUCI√ìN 

I bought a flight with them, I want to change the date of the flight and they want to charge me THE SAME PRICE AS A TICKET AS IF I WERE BOOKING IT TODAY.

With USD 444.67 I can buy a new ticket. HAS NO SENSE
THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ME ANOTHER SOLUTION | This hotel is the best customer service hotel in the 
Monterey Peninsula I recommend you book gateway because their the best out This way | I love the ease of this app. | Ê£í | I was using booking platform for years. Until this happened‚Ä¶
I booked my stay 9 months in advance. When I arrived the owner stated he was booked and I should contact booking.com. Which I did. It took 1 hour to first refund the payment. Then 2 hours on the phone with no help at al from ‚ÄúViP‚Äù customer service. 3 hours later no room no help. They force you to find a new stay yourself.
Worst of all I had to overspend and pay triple of the original hotel price !!! Why you ask booking messed me u and until this day doesn‚Äôt take responsibility for their actions!!! Or lack of action 
User Beware!!!! | Bentley Rise exceeded our expectations for our stay in Lyme Regis. Although we rented a car, the various walks into town each evening were truly a delight as we passed cobbled streets, beautiful gardens, ancient statues and lovely cottages. We had all we needed (and the heated towel racks were an extra delight!) and our hostess Sam checked with us to make certain that nothing was lacking. We looked out onto a beautiful English garden, and unfortunately it was a bit too cool to take advantage of the table and chairs outside just for us--it would have been a perfect breakfast spot! All in all, we couldn't have asked for a better accommodation or hostess--both made this trip a trip of a lifetime. Thank you, Sam! | After being eaten alive by bugs, we were refused a different accommodation or any refund whatsoever. There is no customer service available if you have any problems. Just book directly with whoever you want to stay with. We lost $5500 due to their poor customer care. AVOID! | Very satisfying | Always use booking.com for when I travel ! Love the app | It‚Äôs a great hotel love staying here | Just had to say I booked a trip and my wife booked a trip at the same time didn‚Äôt realize it so I had to cancel one of the trips and it was really easy on Booking.com by the next day the transaction was canceled and I had my money back into my account the following day and my wife has our trip booked and we looking forward to it, Booking.com has been a great experience and look forward to our trip in Park city Utah in the future! | Eu e minha fam√≠lia gostamos da estadia,referente ao atendimento ,localidade,primeira impress√£o das ‚Äúcasinhas‚Äù do lado de fora bonito e acolhedor,o parque aqu√°tico bem legal tbm,tem tudo pra adquirirem mais uma estrelinha se focarem na limpeza .O ambiente √© bom ,apesar de organizado faltou limpar melhor o ch√£o na parte do carpete,por ser antigo vale a pena usar um bom produto de cheirinho(cheiro bom de limpo ja causa uma boa impress√£o ),pertences pessoais de antigos hospedes em baixo das camas(meias),o carpete de fato n√£o estava bem limpo,e a mesa e cadeiras da varanda n√£o teve como usar pois estavam muito sujas.A limpeza e higiene √© primordial ent√£o se melhorarem isso tem tudo pra s√≥ receberem elogios pois realmente √© um bom hotel üòä | Ok | 10/10 reccomend!! | I love BOOKING App. It‚Äôs so easy to use and better pricing compared to other apps. I have travels alot always book through this app. | Our time here has been amazing! Place was clean and staff was on point for any needs! Very convenient to places to tour around in akihabara! Recommend and will stay again when the time comes! | I‚Äôve used the app for years now without issues but when it comes to the customer service, it is absolutely frustrating and infuriating. 

I had missed my flight due to an American Airlines employee directing me to the wrong terminal and needed a rebooking ASAP. I ended up stuck in JFK New York for 2 days waiting on a response and rebooking. They initially agreed and told me to wait on the confirmation so I waited the first day, calling back multiple times to check. Each time a different operator telling me to wait a few hours, 24 hours and then 24-48 hours. I finally get a call back the next day saying I needed to call the airline to rebook (which I tried but couldn‚Äôt reach them because the line was always busy). 

I call up customer service again asking if they could rebook anything at all and their initial response was to wait another day basically while they figure something out. I had already waited a day and couldn‚Äôt wait another so I ended up having to buy a one way ticket out of New York for the next day. I lost two days waiting on customer service and going through multiple different operators telling me different things. Now I DID buy travel insurance with my ticket and it baffles me that they couldn‚Äôt just rebook the next day flight, because while talking to the customer service operators I found next day flights that were available! 

(Travel insurance is a scam) | Always a pleasant experience with booking.com never disappoints! | Don‚Äôt use booking.com unless you want DAILY telemarketers from a foreign call center calling ‚Äúnot selling anything‚Äù for booking.com. They get loud if you tell them to take your number off their calling list. I will never use booking.com again. | I booked a hotel, and it was the wrong one!
Exactly 1 minute after I canceled the room, only got $10 back from my $149 ! I Called them and they were very rude about it, telling me I should have called them to discuss if before canceling ? But it was literally 1 minute!!! Definitely don‚Äôt recommend booking from them at all, I‚Äôll keep my business with expedia ! | We had a blast at this property! Very comfortable and close to shops and downtown where all the restaurants are. Will be back for sure! | Have used this app while traveling throughout the United States and when traveling in Europe.  Very satisfied.  Highly recommend. | Do not use booking.com. First they offer you ‚Äúlevels‚Äù but you can‚Äôt even do anything with it. It‚Äôs cheaper to book through the actual properties than through the app like it makes you think. And GOOD LUCK trying to get a refund if you don‚Äôt stay at a property because booking takes money from you but pays the properties with their ‚Äúown card‚Äù and it‚Äôs an act of congress to get that money back !!!! You have to stay on them ! The property issued a refund to them on a Monday I can to call them Friday to get them to send it back to me ! | This is great | The first and only booking I have ever made, turned out to be fraudulent in the photos they posted, and was infested with cockroaches. there was no way for me to report it back to Booking.com for them to investigate or even remove the listing so I will never use this company again because I don‚Äôt trust it. Clearly, anyone can put up any type of rental and they are not vetted for safety or cleanliness. where are you considered booking?

 Make sure you check reviews outside of the Booking.com site because they seem to remove all the negative reviews for any properties so you‚Äôre not getting anything real in those reviews. I saw actual pictures of cockroach infested rooms when I looked on other sites like google maps for the same properties. | Has everything you could need!

I got a much cheaper car, and I wanted to be credited the difference. Hopper support was absolutely no help, gave me no credit, and I got the same message multiple times from ‚Äòsupport‚Äô. Do not use this app, go with Expedia or Orbitz. | Luv this app | Very handy I‚Äôm a travel agent and I use this app to help assist dates | I have used them several times. I have earned free stays. Every time I go to a hotel I have to call hopper because they have not paid for my reservation. | Love that this app lets me monitor my flights prices and gives me suggestions on when to buy. | We got a lot of good legitimate information about our flights on hopper and saved a lot of money | This is the best travel app | Very helpful and easy to book with. I use hopper every time I plan to travel. | Great | Hopper sends notifications of trips that are available and special rates.
I am so glad I have this app | Great third party booking app | Enjoy using app. It has everything in it that you could need for travel. | I am absolute happy | best app no Lie | wwwwwo Awww e w I think it‚Äôs time wepoop pop ups in rowy | The apps works properly but the people at the front desk at the Avianca are very deceptive and scary to work with. They only care to make their profit and get the most money out of the customers no matter you already pay for it. | I normally love hopper.  This last time I was triple charged to freeze a flight when the sight said ‚Äúnot responding‚Äù. The extra charges was irritating but I still booked through hopper.  Hopefully I won‚Äôt get triple charged for the flight. | Great deals | Deals always great | Todo es excelente | This is a great app. I always use it to book my flights anywhere! | This app is amazing I love the homes part! Hotels and all so easy to just click and take off! | Love how they tell me when flights are their cheapest | This app gives amazing savings. | Favorite app for everything that has to deal with traveling. | Hopper is a great app to have! | I‚Äôve used this so for my last few flights and it never disappoints. Thank you! | Amazing prices Zondo18 | Great prices & rate tracker. | Good prices | Apply referral code imanig40dm | I 100% recommend the Hooper app to anyone and everyone! It‚Äôs always been a very sufficient app and I never have to worry about having any type of difficulty‚Äôs while using it! I will for sure recommend to anyone in my amediste family and friends for that matter!! | The Hopper App is the most reliable app I have came across yet! Always has had the most amazing deals! I recommend it to anyone, rather is be my family, friends, and strangers for that matter! 10/10 recommend using this app with everyone! | This app is a scam I payed a hotel for more than $600 by the time I got to the hotel my room was under my name by hopper but hopper dint pay my funds I payed out of picked another 600 + called for customer service they were terrible they hanged up on me several times swears they was gonna call the hotel and they dint I asked for a refund and they dint want to give the refunds will never be using this app again they don‚Äôt even deserve one star the deserve 0 | I‚Äôm very excited | It‚Äôs super easy to use and best of all low prices! | Fast, convenient and best rate we found for our rental car. Thanks hopper! | This app is the best | Hopper üêá is a wow factor app that is amazing with great opportunities to travel with reason for those who want to see the world at an affordable value that you can‚Äôt deny. | I love this app it gives you the best prices around | I struggle to under stand how to get this to notify me when prices are good. I live 45 minutes from the beach but never get notification when hotel prices are lower. Hunting myself has worked better . | Always book with Hopper. It‚Äôs easy, gives best options , and costumer service is good and fast !! | Easy to book! | Take it to the next level | Love searching for good deals | I‚Äôve been using Air Hopper for 5 years now and it never disappointed! | I have been using Hopper for my flights. Absolutely love everything. Its super easy to use and easy to see on the calendar what days are cheaper or pricier, the predictions for prices lets you know if you should buy now or wait for the prices to drop. The price watch feature that keeps an eye on your flight and lets you know when the price drops so you dont miss it. The Price Freeze feature is awesome! I froze the price for 3 days on a super cheap flight i was not sure about, for about $12, then the price went super high and they honored the original cheap price and paid the difference. I saved like $200 on each ticket.
They also offer lots of insurance and extras for your trips.
Have not yet used it to book a hotel or rent a car, but will update when I do. | Affordable and easy to use | Finding good deals and prices.

SEE IT ON A MAP

Every time you add a place to visit, it‚Äôs immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you‚Äôre visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.

STORE PLANS OFFLINE

All your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.

GET ON THE ROAD

Looking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you‚Äôre not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.

COLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS

For group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.

STAY ORGANIZED

Access flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‚ÄòThings to do‚Äô and ‚ÄòRestaurants‚Äô you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.

GET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION

For each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.

CONTROL YOUR SPENDING

Set a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates.";"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/11/83/e0/1183e0e6-5bea-5cdc-deff-34590414e3fd/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg";"[""Travel"",""Navigation""]";"[""6003"",""6010""]";"Travel";6003;"4+";"[""EN""]";"103520256";"13.0";"2019-08-22T07:00:00Z";"2024-03-18T22:59:51Z";"Wanderlog is more reliable: we fixed various small issues, and also launched the Dream Trip Contest for a chance to win a $1,000 trip to anywhere in the world!";"2.120";0;"USD";true;1727799497;"Travel and Vacation Planner App LLC";"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/travel-and-vacation-planner-app-llc/id1727799497?uo=4";;4.90813;"Extremely slow and unresponsive | Just downloaded this today and wish I had found this sooner! Well done devs! I agree with others that the UI is a little bit cluttered and the pop-up tool tips are very annoying, however overall it‚Äôs a GREAT app for those who want to be organized and collaborate with others on a trip! I love seeing all the places we want to check out on the map so we can make efficient plans for each day of our trip. I did take one star away from my rating because this app eats up an INSANE amount of battery, even on WiFi. I also found that the response time of the app started to really slow as I added more places to my lists. I would have to click things 2-3 times before the behavior registered. Not sure why that would be and I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just a temporary glitch. If that does not improve I will likely remove the app. :( | I used the app for my trip to Spain and it was exactly what I wanted/needed!! Super user friendly. All I had to do to upload hotel/train/airline information was email my ticket confirmations. I was able to map out my whole trip itinerary and have everything I need for my trip all in one place. I‚Äôve been telling all my planner friends about it. | I love the way I can put all thing in one place for a trip‚Ä¶places to stay, eat, stores, museums, everything! | They put everything I‚Äôd want in a travel planner and made it better and more efficient. And most importantly, USABLE! | It has all the things I require for my travel. From syncing my reservations to putting them on map. Suggesting things to do in neat format to having a to pack list that I can customize. 

Truly amazing app. | I have used this app for every trip we make - super super helpful. | I‚Äôve been cobbling together travel planning solutions for years, with varying degrees of success and always a bunch of clunkiness and frustration. But Wanderlog not only has everything one needs to plan, it‚Äôs very well packaged, looks good, is fun to use, and is rock solid! Plus the cost of a pro account was very reasonable given the work and consideration the team has put into the app; upgrading was a no-brainer for me. Thanks! | I‚Äôve tried a lot of trip planner apps on desktop and iPhone and none have come close to the functionality and simplicity of this app. | You can create the itinerary and track expenses at the same time! | Free version provide enough information and nicely saves travel ideas in one place. I use it also for local eatery and sightseeing.  Love map feature | This app is truly life changing. I wish I would have known about it when it first came out. 

It lets me plan my entire vacation so easily. From spending days on planning down to just a couple house. It has every single thing I need out want when it comes to travel planning. Thank you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | I hate that bait and switch. Don‚Äôt ask for my email for a free app and then try to charge me. Garbage. | While there are many options and resources on this app it isn't intuitive for suggesting places and then suggesting which day they should be scheduled when on a multi day trip. Tips kept popping up while trying to explore. I really got tired of being asked, ""do you want to book a hote?"" I really didn't want to book one until I understood where and when I would be going. The AI feature was nice but there again only some what helpful if you didn't want one of the options. I kept having to return to the beginning to get back to the suggested itinerary. I really am better off just using a map app to plan a route and google each location for info. When planning a trip you don't always have the time to take a class/hrs if you tube, to learn to navigate this app. | I was using an excel spreadsheet and manually looking up the distance between places to plan our trip to Iceland which involves a lot of stops around the ring road. WOW has this made life easier since discovering it. I am a big fan and can‚Äôt stop telling people how easy it is to use and how happy I am about it! | I love Wanderlog!! This app is so useful for planning trips. I am amazed at the depth of features. I love the ability to track expenses, super useful to stay on budget and also to share expenses when traveling with others. The ability to send emails with my flight and lodging info, the AI chatbot, recommendations of things in the area, ability to add to the itinerary and rearrange is all incredible. A delightful user experience üòç This is my new favorite app! | I‚Äôm loving the functionality of this app and how seamlessly it interacts with other maps and email. Update: I had an issue with printing an itinerary, but Wanderlog replied and issue now solved. Thumbs up for customer care! | The app itself is alright, but it doesn‚Äôt let you listen to music or audio in the background, which the app itself has no noise. Might seem small but I find it annoying to the point I use a different app, hopefully they fix soon. | My girlfriend and I used this app to plan our Europe trip and for referencing information/tickets/etc. throughout the trip and it was super helpful! We got the premium version for the trip. | Peter was quick to respond to a request for help navigating the email portion of the site so we could plan our triptogether. Thank you. | It helped us not only plan our trip but also keep track of all the details of vacation.   I was able to set up an itinerary that helped keep all of our plans on track without missing anything.  It was easy to move plans around to different times and days depending on our mood and timing. | I love this app because it‚Äôs such a great way to plan a trip, you‚Äôre able to place all the things you want to do on a list in whatever sections you‚Äôd like, create an itinerary, collaborate with your friends to make sure you‚Äôre all getting in on the plans, and even see all the places you want to go in perspective on a map!!! It takes away the need to do your own research on where things are located by each other and saves you so much time. Love this app so much and won‚Äôt plan a trip without it!!! | It makes planning for trips so much easier, especially with the map feature. I love that I can use the map to avoid spending more time running around than actually doing things. I may use other websites and apps to get ideas for things to do but this is the one that helps finalize my daily itineraries. Highly recommend it! | Searched for ‚Äúvacation planner‚Äù in the App Store and found this absolute GEM. I suffer from a lot of analysis paralysis and get overwhelmed when there are lots of options, especially if I don‚Äôt even know where to start/how to organize. Planning a vacation seems like a burden to me (the exact opposite of what a vacation should be!). I have yet to start planning my own vacations, but vividly remember my mom with printouts of directions, maps, and handwritten novels of advice and travel tips, attractions, restaurants, etc when planning our excursions. This app will definitely help me overcome my fears and help me plan the incredible vacations my mom used to plan!! | I have enjoyed using the app for a group trip. Features I appreciate:
1) a place to put hotel information where everyone can see so that they aren‚Äôt asking you questions about the stay you booked
2) a budget sharing feature. Everyone can see the cost of an activity. 
3) A place to put things you would like to see AND a daily itinerary. I like that I can put everything I‚Äôd like to see and I can put must see activities on the daily itinerary.
4) adding notes! Wow this is so helpful. Many things are closed on Mondays at our destination. I would have put things on our itinerary that wouldn‚Äôt have been available.
Also others can add to the notes too. Keeping everyone communicating well.
5) I like that I can just add others to my list via their email! | Enjoying the comprehensive list of recommendations for my destinations. Very fancy and practical at the same time! | Why can‚Äôt we see transportation info from airports to our destinations. The only workaround is to physically add the airport as an itinerary destination. Which defeats the purpose of adding the flight in the first place 

 EDIT: The developer responded to me. I‚Äôm glad they took the chance to read the reviews and I understand that feature requests like this don‚Äôt always fit into the app‚Äôs data model and may require a significant rework. At the same time, I hope that the owners can recognize that it was an oversite in the apps architecture to not designate airports as an ‚Äúitinerary item‚Äù | ‚ÄúDark mode is here‚Äù blocks app. I pay for apps that don‚Äôt spam me. | Had it 5 min and deleted it . Only good thing was it was a free trial.  Glorified notebook doesnt help plan at all | This app is amazing! So easy to map out activities and plan your itinerary. Easy to look back at stops you wanted to make, restaurants you wanted to go to, etc. if you find some extra time. Love writing notes about each stop and setting my own pictures for more specific memories. Do yourself a favor and download this now! | OMG. Made it maybe 3 minutes into using the app before I had to delete it. After passing the useless (but mandatory) gauntlet of ‚Äúwhat kind of traveler are you?‚Äù questions, I was then under a constant assault of ‚Äútip‚Äù popups, continually in my way. And even when i mercifully found a moment of peace from the popups, i find there‚Äôs more real estate on the each screen devoted to telling what the app does than there is actual space to do things. 

I can‚Äôt help but think the absurd overuse of obligatory training suggests that the app‚Äôs owners either have zero confidence in their interface or zero confidence in their users. Not sure which is worse. | Used this app to plan my trip to Hawaii with my Wife. Used the free version and it was extremely easy and helpful. Would highly recommend! | I love this app! Some features are still in a development stage, like the AI, but this is a great all-in-one travel app. 
I was about to attempt to put together a single information sheet for my family trip. 
This is so much easier and better than anything I could have come up with in my spare time. 
I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it continue to develop! Worth the money for the annual subscription! | Unfortunately, I lasted less than a day with this one. After getting bombarded with ‚Äútips‚Äù on how to use the app I found the interface to be super cluttered and distracting. To pay $50 a year for an app, I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm being upsold on lodging, attractions and transportation at every opportunity. Let me decide if I want to explore those. Also, you have a big red ‚Äú+‚Äù at the bottom to add a new trip, you don‚Äôt need to devote 3/4 of the Home Screen to Plan Your Next trip. Devote that area to the current trip I‚Äôm planning. For now, subscription canceled. | It says is free but is not free, I am not paying $49 a year for an app to make an itinerary the pricing is absurd, I deleted right away I rather build a spreadsheet myself. | Love the app, just need to be able to rearrange places right on the map. | This app was a lifesaver for us on our trip to Europe. My husband and I both had access to anything we needed. We had so many details to keep track of and this app really saved us!! The email import feature was excellent. | This app is not worth it at all, after canceling my subscription days before the renewal date they still charged me $53 and they will not respond to any emails I send. I‚Äôm done with this app please don‚Äôt download this app!!!!! | I love using it to track my itinerary, keep lists of places we want to go or other options and consolidating my reservations confirmations into a single place. Easy to use. Best travel app I‚Äôve used! | I‚Äôm planning a three week driving tour across the US and it would not have been possible without Wanderlog! Well, it would have been possible, but not nearly as all inclusive and fun.  Wanderlog captures your itinerary, your lodging, your exploration ideas and puts them all in one place at your fingertips.  The added benefit is that once taken, your trip is saved and you can reference it for memories or for recommendations to make to friends | The only travel app you need for information on a lot of destinations! I love this! | This is very easy to use and a nicer way to stay organized than trying to organize everything in an email inbox or spreadsheet. | I bring up this app all of the time. Exactly what I dreamed it would be. Intuitive, good capability and currently using the free version. | This is probably the most user friendly travel planning app! Love the maps and layout. | Hands down the best app if you like to plan your own trips. There‚Äôs nothing like it! | Just downloaded this app, excited to have one place to plan out upcoming road trip but going to keep looking before paying for this app. | This app is truly amazing. I am fairly new to traveling and I have a hard time having fun and finding fun activities to do when I travel. However, this app helped me to keep track of my flights, it helped me to remember what hotel I was staying in, and it helped to find fun excursions near me. This app is the reason why I enjoyed my last three vacations and I am thankful. They need to update their cruise tracking information but other than that it‚Äôs a great app. | The only planning tool that you need is wanderlog. | I stumbled upon this app and what a gem! I love the interface and the ease in which you are able to plan trips including adding your flight and hotel info along with inviting friends and divvying expenses in the same app. I am planning a trip using this app and can‚Äôt wait to utilize it. My favorite part is that it‚Äôs free and you can upgrade to pro if you‚Äôd like. | Amazing user friendly app that helps me stay organized on trips- helps me get a real life idea of how it would be on the actual trip.";4.90813;14509;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/cd/9c/52/cd9c528e-a703-0b0a-4cba-f5e516562435/7c11f2f0-0b41-4921-ad99-c58ff1368813_iPhone_5.5_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/2f/6d/dc/2f6ddc71-7c0d-7d10-e74a-4b76bf06ff65/3926c542-004f-46c1-bd4b-541c5650f12b_iPhone_5.5_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/25/39/30/253930c3-1a7b-6933-fdbc-387196b5e9b1/86825c86-6085-4e5d-ab01-402f97df41b7_iPhone_5.5_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/f0/6c/cd/f06ccd67-6605-6dde-137a-32c622dcf2a2/c549a73f-721d-4b3e-9a67-77e344a91a9b_iPhone_5.5_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6f/79/47/6f794777-0bad-ff83-8b1a-42c89c0793d5/e6e09e56-ac47-4f66-8e7c-61196925caa4_iPhone_5.5_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/19/0b/35/190b35ae-c856-06f9-8c1f-503a9e020287/e8fd5f56-38da-43f5-b543-bd0a7a27308f_iPhone_5.5_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7c/97/91/7c979172-add0-b56b-7c1e-5a1bd03c7cee/785f2313-ef55-48d9-a549-9d46e129598a_iPhone_5.5_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/20/12/0d/20120d72-cc87-1e00-6729-d1b9fbc0caa4/8124413c-3bd2-4022-877a-7d5c7d9983aa_iPhone_5.5_10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/72/48/11/72481124-0597-3364-3593-8276b79937ec/d34ee418-5bed-40e8-b629-333ccbb5e06a_iPhone_5.5_11.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/da/bd/3d/dabd3d3d-5f17-0355-4363-d61bc2d2c739/619c8f56-3919-4820-b0a0-ba8f06b4147a_iPhone_5.5_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ad/34/74/ad3474bf-e4a2-516a-21bd-ecf4b8f47628/414f37c6-80f8-4056-9921-8441e60d6a55_iPad_alt_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/73/40/80/73408081-b2d0-4862-193e-0672e62dd8a0/35e12460-c10a-4126-bbdc-1122ac9fdc12_iPad_alt_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/61/97/63/619763eb-c2f6-e083-8a02-7e91d731dc17/36e9287f-56d7-4276-b052-ecb41a18915f_iPad_7.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/2f/52/ca/2f52ca6b-d8fd-2830-5e42-ef0385730dcf/bf65d65b-b080-42de-836c-bf11a60ac005_iPad_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/60/64/b2/6064b2d9-bb6c-7934-160e-cedf1286f107/8fa9155a-8926-459e-9e08-46866a954ce7_iPad_4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9d/1e/de/9d1ede80-cedc-1315-9fb1-c49f03baece5/2c291994-4048-415b-a0af-d96b373160ef_iPad_11.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ce/2d/41/ce2d41c6-8785-29e6-7eed-7437e352b874/7be8f4bc-f6a1-4405-b55e-11506f4d84b7_iPad_6.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/29/b6/d2/29b6d27b-e10b-da75-040b-3d56c6754e54/c03329cb-5a4d-4a85-a8c8-7e77b26cd2e4_iPad_5.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdG

After our 19 hour flight we wanted a comfortable hotel to just relax‚Ä¶. This was the best place. From the super comfy bed, the gorgeous roof deck pool with jacuzzis, gym that overlooks the city, the most reasonably priced delicious buffet you will ever experience and the friendliest staff- you must stay here! It‚Äôs an absolute dream for the price. You may not be right in the downtown area but we took a tuk tuk ride thru the city center and we were VERY happy with our choice in hotel. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. 5 stars. Do it! | Good review sit but a little complicated. | The amount of design that went into this hotel is amazing, tons of nest tables and unique lounge areas, everything is storybook magical and photo worthy.  It captures the essence of Tulum vibe.  The location is central and perfect, the vibes are great. The staff is helpful and super friendly.  Primo was an amazing guide and very helpful with everything.  The wait staff was always on time and friendly, Julian was awesome and always on his job.

This is perfectly Tul√∫m.  I will be back.  The only drawback to this hotel is that it is in between nightclubs, so the bass is pounding all night until 2am. | Everything is excellent about this hotel , I need people from all over the world, and make so many friends, the service is amazing. Plus Cleaning is super super amazing. 
Mostly a cleaner that‚Äôs called Domenica. She is very amazing. She take care for my  room to look perfect and clean like first day i get inside!! 
I never saw this service in any other hotel! 
I really appreciate you guys! | Every year we come here for my husband‚Äôs birthday dinner. It was excellent as usual. The staff treats you with special care! Miguel and Bertha were very attentive. We were greeted warmly by the owner. Our favorite!! | OMG! We had such a blast at this charming little bar!!!  The music, dance, and camaraderie just kept taunting the joy out of us! Love you all! | It is always great to be able to TripAdvisor for recommendations when we travel. Love the feedback!!! | If you just want to see a bunch of ads for yours then check this app out. No real indormation anymore. Just went on a trip and no vendor cared about TripAdvisor reviews anymore‚Ä¶just Apple and Google maps. | Warren was the ValetMgr who offered us great service a couple of weeks ago. Above and beyond! | You cannot edit your business in the app. It tries to load some terrible web-version but even that is awful. | We had a delightful tour guide. She was very knowledgeable of the area. She shared so much information with us. Her enthusiasm has made me curious to find out more information about the island. There was a small  group of us that day so we had her undivided attention. We felt free to ask questions. A Great time was had by all. Thanks Molly‚Äôs Tours‚Ä¶. | I sent emails but there comes no solution or explanation | We enjoyed the view and the food.   The service was wonderful and very friendly staff. | Lugar excelente, familiar, caf√© da manh√£ maravilhoso. Funcion√°rios educad√≠ssimos, o Sr Bruce √© muito simp√°tico com as pessoas, deixa o ambiente mais alegre üëèüëè | Bohdi Terrace was an amazing dinner experience. We showed up from our flights and retired and sat down and were greeted with smiles and a good attitude from the staff. I would like to particularly mention, our waitress Kanun, who was so helpful and helping us learn about Thai cuisine, and all that we were eating. My brother and I truly enjoyed her company and service. She made our first day in check my memorable. Thank you, Kanun and Bohdi Terrace staff. | Friday night at 8:00 with our party of 12 we were met at the door by Mike the owner. What a charming host he was. We were introduced to Stacey the manager and she led us to a very busy, friendly bar while she put together our table. We had drinks and settled in to peruse their menu. After a bit we placed our orders among the excellent menu items. It was a very nice evening with great food and service. Priced reasonably matching the tasty entres‚Äô. Thank you Mike and crew. We will be back! | Jamaal made our stay at The Westin so special. He helped us find the best places to eat in StLouis. He not only made great drinks , he spent time helping us with directions to a from our hotel and made suggestions on restaurants. We would never have known about the Blues Museum. 
A nice, caring human being, that makes travel a pleasure. 
The other staff here at the Westin are top of the line. 
We | What a blast with Kapalua Zipline! Our guides Ryan and Dylan were phenomenal! Stellar knowledge of the landscape, island‚Ä¶ and of course the zips. They had a great way of ensuring you not only felt welcome and had fun ‚Äî but felt safe! Great assets to the organization. The entire team was top notch. We brought our go pros but their photos were incredible! Don‚Äôt miss it! Would 100% do it again. Family of three! | Our driver, Montiel was excellent. Very friendly and safe. Plus right on time. | We always have a wonderful experience here.  We are especially fond of the waitstaff.  Our hats off to Francisco, Gustavo & Rafael.  My birthday celebration was most festive‚ù§Ô∏è | I'm having an issue that needs to be fixed and I have been trying to get ahold of support but it's been months and they just won't respond which has been so incredibly frustrating. | This used to be a good app but but now its garbage. The filters are completely worthless. If you try to put in a particular hotel so you dont want to see the map flooded with numerous other hotels it doesnt work AT ALL!! It will show all all the other hotels and you wont be able to find the particular hotel your looking for!! 
I travel numerous times a year because I transport Akita dogs for a Rescue I work with and have been doing this for 10 years. I read reviews to help me decide on where I will stay. I wrote a bad review on a motel that didn‚Äôt allow big dogs because it was never indicated in the description of the motel. I wrote a bad review but I was courteous about it and did not use any foul or abusive language but trip advisor didn‚Äôt like it and removed it. How many other numerous times do they remove bad reviews?????? 
It was an ok app in 2014 but now its just horrible | Traveling solo female and TripAdvisor is my go to source! | Great vibe on rooftop.   Beautiful sunset and tightrope performance!   Very attentive wait staff.   All our drink and food selections were thoroughly enjoyed!    Very memorable evening! | Now I can only add one photo at a time to my review. If I have three photos: Upload 1 photo, tap add photo, Upload 2 photos, tap add photo, Upload 3 photos, and submit. I would prefer to select all photos and then submit, like it used to work. | Thttt | People change, do TripAdvisor. Interest of people visiting places is different than few years ago. Quality is not paramount, it is cost, and people is looking for a fix instead of good food and lodging. Good luck! | My husband and I just returned from a wonderful week in beautiful Sri Lanka.  We traveled around the country, seeing different areas and experiences.  Reshini planned the perfect itinerary which included all the important sites and gorgeous hotels.  Shan was our chauffeur/ guide, and was extremely knowledgeable about the history and facts about everything we saw, and his English was perfect!  We enjoyed every experience- 2 safari‚Äôs, a train ride, boat ride, cooking classes, a cultural show, and even riding in an oxcart.  We strongly recommend Blue Lanka tours, Reshani, and Shan!! Couldn‚Äôt be any better!! | Use your website to generate commends card from my island tours.

Very helpful | The cooking class started with a visit to a nearby market.  It was very colorful and displayed the fresh local ingredients.  
Our instructor was Ilia was very knowledgeable and kept us all engaged in learning and preparing the meal with local fresh ingredients. | An absolute useless app! | This is a experience you should not miss. This is eating like the locals do and having the expertise of our guide to choose the best stops. Really enjoyable. | Beautiful, luxurious hotel with impeccable service by Julian, Nina and Gilles, manager.  Real treat was breakfast in the room.  Room 14 was so spacious with great views of Royal Chateau and river. Lovely town and such helpful staff.  Would definitely stay here again.  Few minutes walk from Paul, great bakery. | This site is always first on my list to read honest reviews. Great job | Just updated to the newest version and still cannot save anything to the itinerary | I have found this app very helpful. 
The only thing I caution people is be open minded. Not all reviews should be believed. I have taken some chances and was beyond pleased. 
Overall the app and the content are accurate. | The app only wants to show you things in the TripAdvisor ecosystem. By this I mean want to find a restaurant nearby? You can‚Äôt search by traveler ranking, it‚Äôs sorted by availability - meaning only those restaurants that have online reservation systems that talk to TripAdvisor. This is not user friendly at all. | We met our tour guide, Martin, at the opera house. At exactly 10:30 Martin gave us an introduction. Martin was using a small speaker that could be heard by our very large group, over 40 people. During the introduction Martin stated that he would explore the recent political history as well as the history of the city from the 1500s. Before we began walking, Martin informed us that we were considered live targets for the vehicles in Buenos Aires and therefore we had to keep our heads on a swivel. 

During the tour, Martin would express factual elements of the political system, as well as the financial issues within the country. When he was speaking about the history of Buenos Aires and the indigenous people, he spoke factually. I appreciate the fact that he was speaking to us with fax, not opinions, but he would express other peoples opinions, both right, and left as written in newspapers. It was very eye-opening for us. The tour was a total of 35 blocks long or 3.5 km or little over 2 miles long. It was a very enjoyable three hour tour. When we stopped for discussions. Martin would always find a shady spot for us. We did have a break during the walk.

Overall, I would give this tour a 5 star rating and highly recommend Martin for this tour. | We have taken this tour twice and enjoyed each time. It‚Äôs fun to actually see the shipping port and the cruise ships, cargo ships & tanker ships. It was fun to see the houses of several rich & famous people along with their yachts. And it was fun to see parts of Ft. Lauderdale. | Very nice place I‚Äôll definitely come again 
Very friendly staff 
Outstanding service | Located in south Miami Beach right on the ocean. Adult only pool with delicious tropical drinks and lunch menu. The staff is extra attentive - especially Lois and Anthony who help to get you arranged in your poolside seats and make sure your content for the day. Eric is one of the waiters who quenches your thirst and serves you with his cheerful personality. Relaxing vacation in style. | For those who are seeking a local experience, this is the place.  Limited seating and quality food makes for high demand amongst locals and travelers.  Try to avoid the lunch hour. | Fell into this place while visiting  Getsamini in Cartagena.  Oh Lord! This place has fantastic food, an incredible vibe, looks beautiful and the service is above and beyond. Work a little hard to find it and you won‚Äôt be disappointed! Oh, and it isn‚Äôt expensive! | Thank you V for booking my spa day with a smile! And looking forward to my spa day with the ultimate massage therapist Vey! | Buggy beyond belief. Just updated. 21 Feb 2024. Filter stuck on availability. Tried to swap for traveler ranking and no matter how many reboots, 6 attempts at chging to TR, nothing worked. Just getting a simple: rank restaurants in order is impossible, at least for app on ipad.
Pure junk | Kiki was the best! She introduced us to a wonderful taste of Argentina as well as a fun tour of the Palermo neighborhood. So glad we booked the tour üòä | The app is a great resource for information and gathering opinions and experiences from other people. The thing that I don‚Äôt like is anytime I look something up I get flooded with emails wanting me to book my trip or review someplace I haven‚Äôt even been to yet. | I love Marco! He is a sexy man who brings a lot to the table. He is there to help the table! Great place to eat! | Quaint, picturesque, and comfortable! Thurston House is a beautiful 1885 Victorian home and a happy surprise just minutes outside Winter Park, Florida. Beverly is a gracious hostess and a wonderful cook. Her homemade pumpkin roll is amazing and her eggs and sweet potato hash with turkey sausage and fruit and coffee are wonderful too. Yummy! Everyone staying at Thurston house was delightful to have a conversation with at breakfast. My daughter and I were very comfortable in our incredibly clean and welcoming room. We stayed in the Cubbage room and it was lovely. Thank you, Beverly! We will definitely be back!‚ù§Ô∏èWhat a treasure! Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the serene setting on the wrap around porch. Will make sure to stay longer next time. | Love to use TripAdvisor while vacationing.

Muy confiable, la recomiendo a ojo cerrado. | i'm very impressed with the website. I haven't been on here in about two years and to whom it may concern. There has been a lot of upgrades and it's a lot easier to use. I've only been out here a few times and I'm extremely impressed. Thank you very much. | The people at the front desk weren‚Äôt nice. The floors in the room were really dirty and there was leftover food from a prior guest in the refrigerator. | Expedia lets me check an itinerary paid for by someone else but doesn‚Äôt give me the confirmation number so I can check in. Awful app, definitely avoiding using expedia in the future to avoid the awful user experience they prefer. | I have a confirmation number and itinerary number and email all confirming my reservation through Expedia for my rental car in a foreign country‚Ä¶ Iceland. 
When I arrived after being awake for two days of travel, the company states they don‚Äôt have a reservation yet. I can see it on their actual website.
Expedia great advice to help me solve. The problem was just go to another rental car place and book another car. | No reception available | Booked a car with Expedia, they have not issued refund in 6 weeks. I spoke with their managers 3 times and they still have failed to issue a refund for a car that I was unable to pick up do to the car being unavailable by Sixt. I‚Äôve spent 11 hours on the phone with them and in chat. They promised a refund within 14 days then within 72 hours, still no refund. I ended up booking a car the same day with Alamo from the Expedia app, so they verified I picked that Alamo car up the same day and was unable to pick up the car from Sixt. Fellow consumers, beware with prepaying anything to Expedia, you may be left in the same position as me. | This hotel was so clean, smelled so good too!! The staff are super nice. We‚Äôll be staying here whenever we travel this way. Great Job, Fairfield by Marriott!!! | Fantastic local bar - Resturant..  Great food! | Expedia is my go-to to find places to stay wherever we travel-closer to home when family and friends visit, and anywhere I‚Äôve gone. | Me encantar√≠a que permitiera varias formas de pago para una transacci√≥n √≥sea hacer pago con 1 , 2 o mas tarjetas a la vez | Extremely disappointed  as their app failed, and charged us for three rooms which they won‚Äôt refund. Caution againdt using them. I‚Äôve been a loyal customer for decades and this new integration with VRBO has caused numerous hassles. | This is our second time to stay here.

Staff very friendly and accommodating. Rooms very comfortable. Location is amazing and the views are incredible! | Expedia doesn‚Äôt really give you the ability to filter anything see after search through all the parameters. I don‚Äôt know how IT people can make such a unuseful app. | Makes a lot of errors, double check everything especially your dates. | This is the second time and there wont be another.   So I booked a flight to Dallas so i could then go to Waco to watch my daughter‚Äôs Acrobatics & Tumbling team face Baylor.   Just prior to the trip my daughter sustained an injury that would require surgery the Tuesday before we were to fly out.   I contacted Expedia who would do nothing to help!  They said I would have to contact American Airlines because that is where my ticket were though.  I have contacted both companies telling about my situation and neither are willing to help.  Neither company would even offer a voucher to fly somewhere else at a later time.   So much fine print. I will never use Expedia or American Airlines again.  They just like to keep the money from the hard working people even at the time of a medical emergency. Ridiculous!!!! | Couldn‚Äôt find a number to call | Expedia sold me a room that didn‚Äôt exist charged me over $1200 and even though I showed them proof over and over again they refuse to give me a refund. Finally after three months of nonstop, trying and literally dozens of times of providing an absolute proof, they agreed to refund said it would happen within 7 to 10 days put it in writing, and yet still three weeks later still have not refunded, although my credit card company is trying to back charge them. They are the worst group to deal with the worst customer service. You can‚Äôt get a hold of anybody on an executive level when they‚Äôve done something wrong I‚Äôll never use them again. | As is well-known, Expedia offers a 24-hour free cancellation policy. Today, when I accidentally booked the wrong round-trip flights, I promptly attempted to cancel. The first leg was with Alaska Airlines, which I successfully canceled. However, when trying to cancel the second leg with Spirit Airlines, it consistently displayed a message stating the ticket was still processing and to wait up to 2 hours. Despite waiting until late in the day, the status remained unchanged. Upon contacting Expedia customer service, I was informed that they only guarantee free cancellation for the main airline, which in this case was Alaska. They advised me to contact Spirit directly. I'm puzzled as to why Expedia prominently advertises the 24-hour free cancellation policy without clarifying exceptions, such as for non-main airlines. Additionally, I'm unsure how they define the main airline. Their insistence on showing the ticket as processing until I reached out to them only added to the frustration. As a loyal customer of ten years, I'm deeply disappointed with Expedia's recent service. | Waited one hour for car then cancelled my reservation
SteveW | Watch for the fine print when you pay for an upgrade and it isn‚Äôt delivered. Expedia will take no accountability. | 20 years ago, Expedia used to really be something. You could actually get a customer service agent on the phone. Now it seems to be just virtual and it‚Äôs horrible horrible horrible. I still prefer to go back to the old way of just contacting airlines in the hotels directly | Hard to reach.  ‚Ä¶no one ever responded to my message reg requesting confirming e mail for recent rental car reservation with Advantage.. plus, I had to cancel original reservation to be able to change pick up time. So I‚Äôm asking for confirmation reg my second reservation!!! Please comply:(:):(:) | When you book a car rental on Expedia, they have no guarantee that you will get what you booked. In fact, I just experienced the biggest nightmare ever in travel. When I booked a Cooper EV through Expedia it did not say that the car could only go max 100 miles without having to have the battery recharged. It would take the battery about 3 1/2 hours to only get 15 miles. On top of it you had to find a battery that was plugged in not a Tesla type of station. This cost me double the amount of money at the car rental agency called NU
The car agency totally ripped me off because they knew that they could. They said they had no inventory when they did. They forced me into running a car at almost twice the price. I will never use Expedia or the car rental agency NU
Also, Expedia is taking no responsibility. They said they don't guarantee what you purchased. | There‚Äôs no customer service phone number readily available to call. | I have spent the last three hours trying to get a hold of Expedia to be able to use a credit. I have on there that expires soon. But it seems to be impossible to contact anyone to help you as the app has zero ability to help you correct the problem! | I have been trying to get in touch with someone to cancel a booking that I made several months ago. It is impossible to get this done. I have been working on it for 45 minutes and still at no avail. | Very easy to find hotel for me and my family | Every now and then login info got deleted with new update and very annoying having to go through set up. I still can‚Äôt log in my account this morning after the update and i have travelling in a few hours | How can I chat if my typing is disabled? I was in line, waited over 15 minutes. Got disconnected and couldn‚Äôt continue with my problem | So frustrated trying to use this app to show my existing flight itinerary. Booked my flights via Expedia.com but cannot see them with this app no matter what I try to do. Customer support told me, I have the ‚Äúwrong point of sale‚Äù and need to change it. What the heck? Rather than a customer issue, that sounds like an app design issue to me. | Expedia is not forthcoming in their prices. You advertise a price which INCLUDES airfare but then at the end I am being charged extra for the airfare. I‚Äôve called several times and it seems no one can answer that question. Just frustrating. | I tried for a week to buy a ticket but i continuously got an error message saying try again later. I even called customer service. She tried to help me buy the ticket but she got the same message. She told me it would be fixed in a week. I tracked the ticket as it went down and then shot up. 5 days later still couldn‚Äôt buy it. But its ok. I gave up on Expedia/ Travelocity and I got a great price directly from Qatar airlines! | I need a refund | I don‚Äôt understand why after Covid, hotels still think it‚Äôs ok to not do housekeeping    Also, the entire lobby was under construction with little to no room to walk.  Three elevators and only one worked for the entire hotel (12 floors).   No mention of the construction in the write-up, we would have gone elsewhere.   Hilton needs to up its game. | When any problem happens you could not get help. | While it‚Äôs a small hotel with doors opening to the outside, the interior is very, very clean and nice. King bed was very comfortable. | Where are they. | I tried several times to cancel my reservation and couldn‚Äôt get through to the automated system. When I finally got through it was past the time of the cancellation deadline & now I‚Äôm going to be charged for the room. I couldn‚Äôt find another number to call for help. This is not acceptable when you‚Äôre trying to make a cancellation in a timely manner! | Very cumbersome to log on. Code sent to email, not message via phone. By time I get the email on my iPhone 13, time has lapsed. 
Then the password is required. 
Why not allow my iPhone facial recognition. It‚Äôs a pretty common method for other apps. | Worst customer service in the APP | Received multiple confirmations from Expedia that my flight booking had been confirmed. When I tried to check in for my flight with the airline, saw that my booking had been cancelled because my travel agent (Expedia) failed to confirm the booking. American Airlines said Expedia actually send duplicate bookings to them which caused the issue. This trip was for my nephews wedding. Expedia ruined my 5 years olds experience of meeting her extended family for the first time as most were flying in from abroad for the wedding. Thinking about the whole experience still leaves a sour taste. Throughout this debacle the Expedia app was still asking me to check in and providing updates to me that the flight was cancelled while their agent was claiming that the flight was cancelled and my refund had already been processed. I am just waiting to get my money back so I can delete the Expedia app and move on with my life. Do not use Expedia their standards have dropped significantly. Book directly with the airline or find a better travel agent. | Some properties listed as hotel don‚Äôt even have shower and lack fitness to be listed as hotel property. | Great place to stay. Clean. | Tried several times to change my email and nothing works. Can‚Äôt even get support by phone or online. | Booked a trip. I need to change the date to the app won‚Äôt let me. There‚Äôs no one to call. This is absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôm not using Expedia in the future. | Me en canta es la aerol√≠nea m√°s mejor y trata a sus gente bien la amo | I find flights then when I book prices change | I love traveling 100 | I love how they truly put the user first by giving us the best deals on the market. I‚Äôve downloaded every traveling app and the only one that comes remotely close is Priceline. However, Priceline is only cheaper on hotels (and this is not very often). 

I tell all my family, coworkers, and people I go to church with to use this app to travel.

They‚Äôve always been very good to me. I haven‚Äôt had a lot of mishaps with them. | It‚Äôs a very nice hotel with a nice and friendly staff. I loved the price of the room and the features inside. 5 stars from me | Roaches in room. | It was too difficult for the app to bundle my flight hotel and car.  Had to book them separately.  Big bummer .  Otherwise prices are great and free cancelations and pay later are useful features. | I made a mistake and booked the room for the wrong day. I reached out to Priceline and they went out and contacted the Hotel and got it canceled. That‚Äôs above and beyond great customer service. | Didn‚Äôt pay the hotel for my reservation ‚ÄºÔ∏è | I have been doing business with Priceline for four years and have never come across this problem before my son is a United States, Marine, stationed and sit in camp Pendleton in California, so I always get the dates when he can come home. I booked it almost 2 months in advanceand his time is to come home and last minute they changed his deployment date so he couldn‚Äôt come home the full amount of time so I explained the situation to them and they said to me I had to pay $360 more to change his flight to back home a few days early I told him I‚Äôd never use Priceline again that they did not respect our military men and women. I am so disgusted I even was told in the beginning it would cost $99. OK I can deal with that but then come back and tell me 360 after we‚Äôre doing the booking is just wrong. This is out of our control, so why should we be punished for it? I‚Äôm done. | Absolutely will NEVER use Priceline again. Hotel I booked was completely misrepresented as a nice clean hotel. It was anything but that. Rubber gloves on door knobs and green stuff growing on walls. It was DISGUSTING AND UNSAFE! Priceline REFUSED to do anything to make it right. So basically we were forced to pay for the nasty hotel(which we refused to stay at) and the nice clean hotel we found on our own! Will not ever use Priceline again! | I have been a Priceline customer for 10 plus years.   They are simply the best for personal or business travel!  They have the best prices, make all the trip arrangements and provide superb service. | We stayed one night. The hotel is going through major remodeling renovations. Our room had been remodeled and was lovely. The King  bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. The Keurig coffee maker was easy to use, and had the cake cups ready. The bathroom was remodeled and very nice. The furniture closet desk in the room was updated and very nice. The front desk woman was extremely friendly and professional, and a big help, there is a red lobster nearby and brick house tap that was delicious! | Best prices.  Easy to use | TITLE SAYS IT ALL | I booked a room for $61.00 Alexis Park All Suites Resort. 
Specifically chose a Pet Friendly room for my 8lbs chihuahua. 
Drove all day from Idah, on my way to my daughters funeral. 
I get here and this place charged an additional 113.00 non refundable fee for my pet. Plus taxes and fees that were higher then Priceline charged me for the price of the room. 
I was told by the manager at the desk, I can feel free to find another hotel. 
Which Priceline terms specifically say this reservation is non refundable. 
I cannot drive at night due to my vision and have my younger daughter traveling with me. 
I was horrified at the lack of empathy the employees showed. 
When asked why I would have paid more for a Pet Friendly room if I did not have a pet. Why was the the reservation with all taxes and fees include not show this blind random charge?
She made me feel like she was going to refuse service and kick us out if I did not immediately give her $113.00 no refundable pet cleaning fee and another 30.00 tax and room fees and a 75.00 hold on top of the money I paid for this reservation to Priceline app. 
I just had a daughter die in an automobile accident and have no choice but to pay the money or risk driving to find another place to stay in Las Vegas. 
I was here on Christmas 2023 and paid a total of $64.00 for the MGM Grand beautiful | Price Watch does not work at all. I can turn it on, and it will turn off. | Easiest way to book a hotel. | I booked a flight JFK to Tacoma Seattle for $154 the day before the flight. Non stop, convenient time. Before I was with Orbutz. They have bargain flights too, however they don't show the time range, how Priceline. It is more convenient on this platform. And again, compared the prices from Expedia, Orbitz, and Priceline - Priceline has the lowest prices. My husband was on a trip some days after, and he needed hotel in Wisconsin, there was even one offer for $27!!! Keep in mind that many offers are non-refundable, though, because I booked a hotel room for him once, and after about twenty minutes, he called me saying that he needs to drive further, asking to cancel it. I couldn't, but I had been warned that it was non-refundable, so it was fair. | I recently booked a hotel stay with Priceline for 14 days. I prepaid with my credit card but reasons out of my control I had to leave stay a week early. I was told by hotel staff to resolve the 7 unused days with Priceline since they were who I booked with. To my surprise, Priceline told me that I had to get an approval for a refund from the hotel before refunding for the unused days. As you may have figured Priceline the blame on the hotel for not approving refund. There is still no resolution and I‚Äôm out over $600 dollars. Customer Relations was a waste of time. I‚Äôm never using Priceline again! | Been a Priceline customer for a long time but might be finished. There was a problem with my reservation and they were unable to change it only cancel. I was hesitant to cancel unless I knew I could get the right reservation. Ended up making my new reservation with the hotel directly at a cost of $30.00 more per night, then I cancelled the first reservation. | I had been searching for the best hotel deal for a stay to visit my kids.  After watching and searching several days, an express deal showed up for hotels in my desired area at $89 per night.  The best rate for what I was looking for.  Immediately after booking, the exact same hotel and room was presented to me at VIP price of $81 per night.  The following day, exact same hotel, same room, same days, $74 a night.  Best price guarantee doesn‚Äôt apply in this situation apparently.  Definitely will make me think more than twice about using Priceline again!! I feel taken advantage of. | I picked price break looked all 3 they seemed nice when I booked put me in a ronchey hotel very disappointed | Great app and deals. Unable to view my upcoming trips. Luckily an email was sent but it would be nice to view in the app. | This App is amazingly easy to use to book trips! Its design is flawless! I highly recommend installing and using this awesome travel / booking app! | It‚Äôs very annoying that you have to pick number of occupants to do a search.  It should be remembered by default.  The AI made the mistake about the number of nights. | They never help you. I‚Äôve been charged for a hotel stay and upon arrival I find out that the hotel is overbooked. I neither got a room, nor my money back. The customer service is terrible. | I‚Äôve got to explore areas over several states, for many years with this app. All while getting to stay in adequate to above average accommodations. | Booking was very easy and simple hotel location was very convenient and close to the rodeo. Me and my friends really enjoyed ourselves. It was very nice and clean and the workers was very nice. | Priceline is a good App. However when Priceline awards coupons to their repeat customers they out rank the other online App competitors. | Great deals and even better prices when becoming a VIP memeber!! Thank you | Both times I have reserved with Priceline, I have been horribly disappointed! They call a bed bug infested room with holes in the wall a 3 star rated room!!! It stinks it‚Äôs hot. It‚Äôs disgusting! And they don‚Äôt try to fix it. I will NEVER trust Priceline again, viscount suits in Tucson is so disgusting! | This app is efficient, quick, and reliable. People are ALWAYS willing to help with any problem and willing to take the burden of talking to the hotel‚Äôs themselves. | Planning my first trip out of the country was very easy and convenient using Priceline! I booked my flight, hotel, and activities, all using the Priceline app. Plus, I saved lots of money!! | Good Evening, the thing I hate with these booking sites is that if you have to cancel your reservation wether or not it was just book or previous, you can‚Äôt cancel through the app or manage your reservation you have to wait on the phone then they have to send a email or you have to hold on the line hoping they _The Hotel will cancel without penalty! Its very frustrating at times. Yeah but they did fix it how when you have an express deal you can NOW choose what room size you need. That‚Äôs a blessing before they would never honour any of your rewards. They fixed that maybe they can fix this one too, because this is very annoying ! | The app advertises great prices, then you get hit with almost $40 in fees and taxes for your booking. They advertise ‚Äúpet friendly‚Äù but then you get to the hotel and owe even more money for your pet that was advertised. This app is a money pit. | I am appreciative of the perks of being a Priceline Gold member. Thank you | They will not return your refund if cancelled 30min prior. | It‚Äôs very convenient and have many discounts and options. We highly recommend using Priceline for all your traveling needs. Great prices and  cancellation are available what more can you ask for. | Great stuff | Priceline is nothing more than a middle man who profits from each transaction and uses that same excuse to avoid accepting any responsibility for anything that goes wrong. 
They will ALWAYS tell you to deal with the place you made purchase from. And DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ASSIST. They have NO CLEAR ENGLISH SPEAKING AMERICANS so any type of communication is limited at best and nothing is ever done to assist the customer once they receive your money. | Bad customer service | We book a lot of hotel deals through Priceline. We have looked around a lot but always feel like we get the best deal through them! | Flight was canceled so need to book a hotel near by. Booked on your app. Called hotel and they don‚Äôt have my reservation. Can‚Äôt contact Priceline except through some computer text. Get a response that I have to call booking.com. Call booking and after a 30 minute wait, finally get to talk with a human. Get put on hold, then the human comes back and says that hotel doesn‚Äôt have my reservation and that it is sold out now. Your app failed me tonight and I will definitely look at other means of booking travel. Just ending a week long trip that I booked on your app. Good night, it‚Äôs late and the wife and I need to find a place to stay. | The place was great in cleanliness but twice they tried taking money from my card the second time saying an employee initiated a refund and I couldn‚Äôt check out until I paid. I informed them that I never seen a refund in my card and that I would not pay extra until my bank transaction showed different | By far the best deals on airfare!! The app is so easy to use!! I also love the way they keep me updated through text messages! | I was booking hotel rooms for different family members and accidentally booked two families at the wrong hotel. The mistake was made known immediately and the cancellation was very easy. Now we are rebooked at the right hotel. Thank you! | Very impressive | This is the best app for trips, hands down. I have been a loyal user for 15 years now and find its prices better than anywhere else. Its options are great and once you use it enough, you can do anything you want. Love Priceline!
Ps downside to app, bundles only show on web vs app | Very clean the staff was very respectful. I originally booked a king size. They informed me that they had no one there over the weekend to clean so they offered me a different room which was totally fine. The room was nice and clean. Nobody bothered us will be back again. | 2 funerals in a months time!
PL got me there!! ü´∂üèΩüëçü´∂üèΩ | I didn‚Äôt even know that I was charged for the room that I didn‚Äôt reserved. I checked in at OYO hotel and casino. My account was declined because of the unknown charges made by Priceline and this was the second time that Priceline had done this. Why would I do business with them again when I was charged the first time. This is not a good business. I‚Äôm not stupid to do business with a company that has changed me before.

I can always sort to
My preferences and feel like I get a great rate. | We booked a room on the Kayak app through Super.com and it was a nightmare!  No room when we showed up at the hotel. That was the fault of the hotel.  But dealing with Super.com for a refund has been an utter joke. We had never had an issue with Kayak before this transaction. Very disappointing. | Please add filters to remove boeing airplanes from flights. | I love this way of buying my flights, it is very helpful to find a cheap flight along with my budget. Thankyou so much. | Very good app for flight ticket booking, I had very good experience with the application | Kayak sent an alert of $616  EWR to CDG R/T but when I click, I get everything BUT NOT the ability to book! | Super convenient, affordable, and easy to plan trips around your budget. | I‚Äôve used this app many, many times to get great deals on flights. The explore feature is rad. Very flexible app that if you dig into can really get you a good deal. No joke. | Do not use Kayak. They automate travel sites that also includes scams and upcharges. Use Travelocity. They qualify their partners from my experience. Was charged over $1,000 in travel insurance that was hidden: had to cancel my cc. | How do you have eDream here???? | Me encanta | Confianza y son unicos | Kayak used to be an excellent aggregator if information and direct connection to companies (hotels, airlines). Now they often simply direct you to third party sketchy companies. Not good at all. | Does not allow me to book a rental car through the app. | This app is full of legal scams so do not even trust its partner sights. Book directly with the airline | Great information & excellent cost savings üëç | Sick and tired of Kayak ads. The more i see them, the more i want to delete the app from my phone. | I love how consistently accurate this app is! | Fantastic price. Always recommend friends and families. Always have better deals | When I want to know the arrival and departures of any flight I used Kayak. It‚Äôs always up to date with flight information | I‚Äôm noticing a glitch I‚Äôve seen for recent years now in that my nearest airport is drastically higher priced than the other airport nearby PSC. I cross reference with Alaska Airlines website our only rural airline and I discover it hundreds of dollars cheaper sometimes. Please correct! | PLEASE üôè THANK YOU üôè | 10/10 definitely recommend !! | This is amazing because I can‚Äôt find these low prices on the actual website for the airline ‚úàÔ∏èüòÉ | What a great site. Gives the whole picture and has many filters allowing to get only and exactly what you‚Äôre looking for!!! Been saving $100‚Äôs and still only flying my fave airlines!!! Thank you, Kayak!!! | Kayak is fine but it shows ads, most from UNVERIFIED travel sites some of which are complete SCAMS - Like PriceTravel.
Be careful - if a deal is too good to be true on a sponsored link, it‚Äôs most likely a scam. | The price rises crazily as the number of clicks increases | üëç | I always rely on Kayak for the best user experience to find the best flight deals. I‚Äôve tried other apps out of curiosity, and in my humble opinion, nothing comes close to Kayak. Extra kudos to the UX team for aligning the valuable functionality closely with the user needs and doing it in a polished and fun to use UI. Keep up the phenomenal work! Thank you for doing what you do üòÄ | I‚Äôm insulted with your commercials. They seem to be geared for stupid people so I‚Äôll let them use it. Good bye | Good app | So easy to find out | I always love KAYAK for all travel hotel, flight, and car rental options great prices on everything Thank you for over 40 years of travel experience with Kayak | Kayak works for me: easy/intuitive app, efficient booking process, all relevant info very accesible. 

10 out if 10 Kayak! | Prices are high | I have always used Kayak and it has been great until the last trip I booked. It sent me to eDreams Prime to book and I had to sign up for a ‚Äúfree‚Äù membership. It wasn‚Äôt until after I booked that eDreams informed me that I would be charged $59 a year if I didn‚Äôt cancel my membership. I had to call to cancel (couldn‚Äôt do it on the app) then I had to listen to 10 minutes of them trying to sell me a membership until they finally cancelled it. | Price quoted was raised by almost $2,000 when transferred to booking site. | !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | The best app for finding tickets , hotels and rental cars | The website can search 6 airports, 3 departure & 3 destination. The app is outdated if it can‚Äôt duplicate or surpass the website (DAL has this issue too) | Buenos precios y informaci√≥n de gran ayuda | Of course I can‚Äôt paste the screenshot of the deal KAYAK loaded for me that doesn‚Äôt load when I click the deal button. It just literally doesn‚Äôt exist. Joke. | Worst app for booking flights, and also customer service is terrible | Reserva | Found a nice hotel. Price per night doubled once redirected to Priceline.

I coud not find a setting to increase the font not dies the app utilize the accesibilty setting for font size in the operating system.  In this case, an iphone. As a result I have to pass on using Sky Scanner. | Prices üëçüèª | I find the app most accurate airfare comparison and it shows most of available airlines options | Flight, hotel, car. Dare you to compare with google travel ! | I have tried them all and have settled on Skyscanner as my app of choice. I ALWAYS find the best prices and the best routes . | App redirects to shoddy airfare sellers instead of actual airlines.  This is disappointing as the Star Alliance website uses Skyscanner‚Äôs interface for actual airline prices in the alliance.  Best to book via airlines directly and check via other means than using this app. | Setting price alerts is one of the main features on this app but when I set a price alert in the mobile app they do not appear in the ‚Äúmy trips‚Äù section to be able to go back and view them. Defeats the whole point of the app as it was one of the main reasons I used it. Still works for the most part to find cheapest flights but no good for monitoring the price fluctuations.

Update: There is no option for ‚Äúhelp support‚Äù in the app. There is a ‚Äúsupport‚Äù button and within that a ‚Äúfind help‚Äù button that takes me to a webpage where I can search the apps website for answers to FAQs | One stop shopping for travel needs! Great price alerts for more savings! | I can‚Äôt see the calendar dates with cost of  fare one way. 
Please help | I love this app. It‚Äôs my goto whenever looking for flights. I always find the best rates on here. I‚Äôm always recommending it to my friends and family. I book all my moms travel on here. I like that it redirects you to the airlines website. | By mistake, I put wrong email, and I don't have any record for the reservation. | I would like this app to give me the option to filter-out flights on certain airplanes. I do not have confidence in Boeing, so it is important to me to be able to easily filter-out Boeing flights. | Love Skyscanner. But filtering out planes is crucial nowadays. Will change to 5 stars once aircraft model filters are implemented. Reason: I truly do NOT want to fly in 737 MAX planes, and I can‚Äôt easily filter them out. | Super app to see all travel options and prices! | Why can't I book tickets on this software? Showing my identity doesn't buy it. Only students can buy it. Why is it so difficult that this software is only sold to students? | All of the marketing emails come to me in Pounds Sterling. I can‚Äôt fix it in the app. I‚Äôve tried. Hence, my confidence in this app is low. | Extremely efficient app. | Hate the recent update that removed domestic US flights. Skyscanner was my used travel app and this almost completely ruins the point for me. It was already lacking in filters and the latest update  just made it even worse and ruined the user experience for me | I like it when it shows the price of each day of the months | only reason i used the app | You used to be able to click the explore everywhere tab & it would show you the cheapest flights from your nearest airport. Now it just shows you countries, 0 flights in America. The entire reason I used this app is now gone | Automatic 1 star and deletion of the app | Great deals on airfare directly to the airlines | Why the mention price has been Chang after submitting | Skyscanner is the best app for my travels. They seem to give you honest prices instead of inflated numbers to get extra money from you. I highly recommend. | Not the first time | Links to fraudulent Indian websites | Easy way to compare prices | I don‚Äôt fly basic economy. I wish the app has an option to filter out basic economy fares. I have to leave the app to find the regular economy fare on the airline site. The app should let me remove basic economy fares from the results. | Love this app! | Helped me find flights in a crunch when other sites could not deliver | It would be a better app if the prices WERE ACTUALLY the real prices. Most of the time they give a low price but once you click on it, it doesn‚Äôt exist. For example: I saw a roundtrip for $81 from New York to Colombia I click it and the price doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs so annoying | ŸÖŸÜ ÿ¢ŸÅÿ∂ŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿßŸÇÿπ ŸÑŸÑÿ≠ÿ¨Ÿàÿ≤ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ∑Ÿäÿ±ÿßŸÜ Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÜÿßÿØŸÇ Ÿà ÿ∞ŸÑŸÉ ÿπŸÜ ÿ™ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ®ÿ© | ŸàŸÜÿ™ŸÖÿß ŸÑŸÉŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≤ŸäÿØ ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸÖ ŸàÿßŸÑÿßÿ≤ÿØŸáÿßÿ± | It would be even better if I could save certain settings for the initial search. Specifically, there are certain airlines that I refuse to fly. Of course, whenever I see a great deal, it is usually for one of those airlines (cough, spirit, cough). Any chance there could be an update to the app that would allow for that? A way to save favorite airlines? That way I don‚Äôt get my hopes up when I see a super cheap flight that will just add on the fees AND give terrible service. | Awesome | I have used Skyscanner when I start planning for a trip. Every time I have found Skyscanner very efficient, easy to use, and the price indicator extremely helpful. I will never undertake a trip without using Skyscanner.
Wilson | I went through the entire process of booking a great priced flight only to have it REJECTED!  Wouldn‚Äôt take my three digit CVV code!  Scammers. I‚Äôll never use or recommend your sight again. | Waste of time, price change just before pay. 
Not just a coincidence with this kind of searchers. And do not tell me ‚Äúhigh demand‚Äù | Thanks for such a useful app!
I | Great app. I love how you can search anywhere to find the cheapest flights from your airport | I love it and I like this website | They removed the core functionality that made SkyScanner great several years ago. There was a map and you could search across geographic locations. It‚Äôs now the exact same functionality as every other app, so this is nothing special, outside of a memory of a better, more interesting tool. | When I was attempting to book a room, I got to a screen informing me I could not do so without giving up my mobile number. In doing that I was told I was consenting to receiving automated marketing messages. No thanks. | ‰∏∫Âï•‰π∞‰∏ç‰∫ÜÂéª‰øÑÁΩóÊñØÁöÑËà™Áè≠ÊàëÂ∞±ÊÉ≥ÈóÆÈóÆ | please take back old design it was much better and easier to search for flights!! please! | They hide fees & not show price with bags. 
Don‚Äôt use it save your money. | it doesn‚Äôt work. | Freezing on last confirmation point after accepting my account information. After 30 minutes I had to restart my phone in order to unfreeze the page. I  did that 3 times before giving up and paying $100 more for my room directly from the hotel.

I am very disappointed I thought this app was great hearing these review on here but I change my mind. | At lease at a hotel you can hold someone accountable and/or get a refund if the host doesn‚Äôt hold up their end of the deal. AirBnB does not have any interest in your complaints or concerns. The rental could be completely wrong, full of bugs, mold, and you will be stuck for the duration. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, just research AIRBNB nightmares and you‚Äôll find that this organization is completely corrupt and the hosts are more often than not dishonest in their listings and Airbnb does not verify that listings are as advertised. A scheme all the way to the top. I lost months of funds while traveling due to booking extended stays at a string of listings that fell very short of expectation, including the bugs and mold. It was too late once I realized that no matter what listing I ended up at, none of them were as advertised and the company told me too bad. Video evidence, pictures. Didn‚Äôt matter. They just assumed it was in bad faith. They tell you to settle it on site with the host. They‚Äôll tell you the host has THE ENTIRE DURATION of your stay to resolve the issue. Even if they make no effort to resolve the complaint, it still counts. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE. | Why do you hide addresses? I‚Äôm trying to book a place and I want to look up on a map how close it is to trails. Your built in map doesn‚Äôt show the trails so I need the address to look on a trail map. In the end I didn‚Äôt book through this app. Hiding the address is shady! Hotels don‚Äôt hide their address. I booked a hotel instead! Completely stupid business model! | The idea that Airbnb allows their host to charge crazy high cleaning fees is ridiculous. You should not be allowed to charge a daily cleaning unless you are cleaning daily!!!

Airbnb needs to get rid of the cleaning fees and let the hosts build that price into their rental rates - just like a hotel. | Why is it that I can‚Äôt use the app I have. If I can‚Äôt download new one it seems wrong to force me to upgrade to a new phone. | Air bnb used to be a good option, but now since all air bnb‚Äôs charge $200 plus cleaning fees on top of all the other fees, and built in rules‚Ä¶. Requiring you to clean‚Ä¶. It lost its luster. At least at hotels you don‚Äôt have to clean and you also get free breakfast. | Airbnb used to be so much better - now the customer service is non existent, with any problems you will be speaking to a robot, and my last 3 cases I spent useless hours and nothing was ever resolved! Pull it together Airbnb! No more robots for customer service - give us Real and logical humans! | Limited trust and safety. Multiple scams ongoing related to insufficient host/ fraud checks. Constantly see reviews purporting scams and false placements. | Their host are always so awful. they all just wanna steal your money. horrible app do not recommend. They will try to charge you on top of the total price. overall a horrible app. | Worst experience staying somewhere of my life. $20/night apt and the hosts never settled on how to pay for it. Then pressed charges when stuff was missing from her apartment after I left it in perfect condition minus a used towel. | After arriving at Arthur's condo in Phoenix we requested to cancel because it was the most unsafe area we had ever tried to stay while using Airbnb. I consistently use this service while traveling for work. After the poor and lack of communication from air bnb I will most likely not use this service anymore. 
To give an example the parking lot of the condo and surrounding area was littered with drug addicts dealers and what seemed to be a tent city across the street. I highly recommend not staying here. I'm from the South Side of Chicago and didn't want to get out of the car if you know what I mean. 
There has been no support from air bnb and we will be contacting our credit card company for a refund. | I came to the Airbnb service so that I would not have to worry about finding a place to live. I found 2 ads and both turned out to be fraudulent. How do you keep the service clean? I don't want to look anywhere for housing, I'm ready to pay extra for airbnb service. They are trying to deceive me, at first they tried to take me to their third-party site, then they say that the ad I chose is unavailable, the room is occupied, they offered another one for $ 300 more expensive. Well, I agreed, now they ask to be contacted by phone before confirming the reservation. I am dissatisfied with the Airbnb service, I will never use it again and I will not recommend it to anyone. | I‚Äôve had continual issues with Airbnb over the last year, I can never reserve anything with a vague ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù error. Tried on multiple browsers and multiple devices until I inevitably get a ‚Äútoo many attempts message‚Äù. | Too much expensive . Booking hotel seems to be better than Airbnb | I went to Spokane from Ohio for my sons, chemotherapy treatments me and my wife and my son, when we first got there, we booked under my wife‚Äôs account and ended up having to leave the first Airbnb. We were at because of family emergencies and they needed their home and so we booked a different day well the night after we got there I got a notification from our Host stating that Airbnb canceled our reservation and we needed to leave immediately. I didn‚Äôt understand why so my wife went into her account to check to see what happened and they completely removed her account and said that we were partying even though they had no proof or evidence because we weren‚Äôt. Well, we asked for a refund for the rest of the nights because we spent $900 and they kept saying they would escalate our case escalate. Our case never contacted us back never put the account back up and never gave us a refund for our money. Well, we went and booked an Airbnb under my name on my account and ended up getting robbed. All of our belongings got stolen and Airbnb helped us with rebooking we rebooked the Airbnb. We had the hot tub didn‚Äôt work so we wanted to go somewhere else. They issued us a coupon and the second they issued all those coupons to my account, they sent me an email stating they were removing my account from the platform for party risk of partying, again with no evidence and no warning at all and now they are refusing to talk to us at all and I just lost over $900 again which is totaling out to about $1900 that we‚Äôve lost within the last week and now they refuse to give us our accounts back or even a gift voucher with the amount on it so we could get somewhere else to stay. Do not book with Airbnb. They will scam you. | Mario is been the best host you can ever find, this is the second time using his house and his responses are fast and efficient, thank you Mario | I have been utilizing Air bnb since its inception and I will tell you that it is the hosts that define the quality of this product and not the app.  That being said, the Airbnb app is now the most convenient tool  to find alternatives to hotels in the travel biz.  I do find google search to run a close second to this app and find google infinitely easier to use- such that I find many Airbnb on google then get the details on Airbnb app.  

I still find Airbnb format, codes and operation extraordinarily ineffective in getting the whole picture.  Even many reviews reveal hidden codes as ‚Äúcozy bed‚Äù meaning its rented for 2 people but its not even a queen bed -or- ‚Äúrustic‚Äù surroundings meaning a junkyard is on the same block as where you are staying. 

Also, app navigation has never been that intuitive. I still find myself vetting stuck in places and starti g the app over. It is as if they never really knew what a ‚Äúback button‚Äù was. 

In the end, I have had many good experiences and one or two exceptional ones, all being because the host made it so. 

March 2020 entry

The app has definitely gotten better with a few issues remaining. Receipts can be viewed but not printed, emailed, or otherwise utilized in any way!?? House rules seem to be more dodgy than ever. Sometimes they are easily found, sometimes theyare emailed after a reservation and almost all are rants of disorganized personalities ü§™ . Airbnb survives because of really cool people hosting the coolest and most diverse amenities ever offered. Airbnb serves this market with an average score of 3 stars. App now cuts off text messages and inhibits return messages even inside the app. Het twice the messages tou cannot respond to. Cool! Just keeps getting worse! This app is different but not better Has the search by map been removed or moved where I can't find it?? Why is taking longer to find more unavailable properties? Just updated again to try features and tools. App freezes... App is still clunky but better than it was but I just got recommended stays a surprising distance from my intended destination..... The app is worse than ever and the whole AIRBNB system is getting to be a frustrating mess. I have attempted to book 5 locations in the last 6 months with one success. After a major frustration I was offered over $100 instant credits and still chose not to book with AIR BNB...... This is getting unfriendlier and more ""corporate"" by the day. Earlier version .... Whoever released this needs to roll it back up! I have attempted to book stays with complete frustration and mix ups. The app has reversed it performance of user ease. Avoid this new version.... | It said to update so I did and now it‚Äôs just a black screen | $300 a night? lol, don‚Äôt forget $160 Airbnb fees, $150 taxes, and of course the $250 cleaning fee. Airbnb rates are a joke and so many renters know it and offer their properties on other sites or on personal pages for much less. I doubt you‚Äôll ever find your best deal here. | Airbnb refused to give my handicap mother a refund, even though the property we tried to rent from Stuart Morley was not handicap accessible! There wasn't even room for my mom's wheelchair anywhere and we only stayed a few days out of the 25 that we reserved. Airbnb has this individual to steal from us with no ability to recover the money and the trip interruption insurance they offer is worthless too, and didn't cover anything! Don't ever use this service or you'll lose your money and never be able to get it back. They purposely allow people that they are being prejudiced towards handicap people to continue to be on there and make money from their service. Airbnb is a bunch of thieves. | Since New update, the app will not open on my phone. Just rotates the app symbol. | Most of my personal travel is with my four-legged friend. It is so much easier and less expensive to use AirBNB instead of hotel chains.  Occasionally I use it for business travel when I am looking for a specific area and can‚Äôt find a hotel. | I had always heard from friends how Airbnb scams its customers and it happened to me too. I was held responsible for existing damages in a cabinet and was charged $150 for the chipped corner paint. I have many other friends telling me how the hosts show repair documentation and they go and proceed to over charge for existing damages in a property and they try to hold you responsible for it. | THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY, AS LONG AS THEY MAKE MONEY OFF OF YOU. NARROWLY ESCAPED A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I recently experienced a concerning situation during a reservation with Airbnb, prompting me to share a cautionary tale with fellow users. Regrettably, my experience has led me to conclude that Airbnb‚Äôs commitment to customer safety may not align with their public image. Despite raising genuine safety concerns during my stay and providing detailed information, the response from Airbnb‚Äôs support team exhibited a lack of thorough consideration and logical coherence. The decision-making process appeared flawed, with the introduction of logical fallacies and an apparent disregard for the gravity of the issues raised. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with Airbnb‚Äôs customer service, as it seems the platform prioritizes financial transactions over the safety and well-being of its users. Consequently, I have chosen to discontinue using Airbnb for future accommodations. I urge potential users to exercise caution when considering Airbnb for their lodging needs. While the platform may offer a wide array of options, my unfortunate commitment to addressing safety concerns promptly and responsibly. It is essential for users to be aware that Airbnb‚Äôs customer support may fall short of expectations when faced with issues that require careful consideration and thorough investigation. The logical fallacies evident in their response, including appeals to ignorance, non sequiturs, and hasty generalizations, highlight a concerning lack of rigor in their decision-making process. Such lapses in reasoning raise questions about the reliability of Airbnb‚Äôs customer support and their ability to handle situations that involve safety and security. In light of these experiences, I strongly caution potential users against relying solely on Airbnb for their lodging needs. Exploring alternative accommodation options with a reputation for prioritizing customer safety and providing robust support mechanisms might be a more prudent choice. While Airbnb has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we travel and seek accommodations, my recent encounter has revealed a disconcerting aspect of their customer service that cannot be overlooked. As consumers, our safety and well-being should remain paramount, and I believe it is crucial to consider these factors when choosing a platform for lodging arrangements. In conclusion, my recommendation is to approach Airbnb with caution and to carefully evaluate their commitment to safety and customer support. It is my hope that this review serves as a reminder for users to prioritize platforms that consistently uphold the highest standards of service and safety. | App is very easy to use | It is nice to book and enjoy experiences but let‚Äôs hope nothing detrimental occurs because they have no resolution or policies for refunds | I used to love using Airbnb, now there is a ridiculous amount of fees added at the end and the total ends up being 3 or 4 times the advertised price. This kind of false advertising is very disappointing as Airbnb used to be much more transparent. There is a button you can select that gives you a closer number to what you will ultimately pay.  But I don‚Äôt like being tricked into a false sense of security by these fake prices. | To be clear, LOVE the service. This review is of the app's usability as a visually impaired person.

Text (as in 'how to get in' messages) cannot be zoomed in on. Nor can it be copied by a long press. This forces you into all sorts of cludgy work-arounds.

As noted, love the service but make the app more user friendly. | I‚Äôm a host with three years‚Äô experience on Airbnb. In general, it was OK, but when I got a scammer guest who reserved in the wrong place and then lied and said my place was dirty, in order to cancel the reservation and get her money back, the support from Airbnb customer service was terrible. Though I was a ‚ÄúSuperHost‚Äù with all five-star ratings, they believed the guest and gave her all her money back.
I recently tried returning to Airbnb but found the customer service is still inadequate. They give you the runaround endlessly, seemingly trying to wear you out, rather than help you. I am done with hosting on Airbnb. I recommend using FurnishedFinder.Com. They don‚Äôt take a percentage of your rent, but rather a yearly fee of about $150. | If you get a bad air bnb rental don‚Äôt expect any help from air bnb. Scammers! | AirBnB is one of those services that when it works well and everyone involved is being honest is wonder but the moment you have a disreputable host you can lose a massive amount of money. I had a host mislead me on a listing and when I found out less than 48 hours later and attempted to cancel I was met with a 900 dollar cancelation fee, when I tried to contact AirBnB I was met with a we will reach out to the host and the host refused to give me my money back. Airbnb told me that it was up to the host who had mislead me in the listing to begin with. The real shame is that there are good and honest hosts but the fact that predatory ones are allowed to continue doing business makes it impossible for me to even consider continuing business with them. | The house owner used old item blame us for damage and charge me for damage which we never use and that item not even in my room. The review are fake. You can see one person put multiple 5 stars review make it looks like perfect place. 
Double charge for cleaning fee. Why we are still using Airbnb? | ÁÇπËøõË°åÁ®ãÂçïÔºåÊèêÁ§∫ Êú™ËÉΩËØªÂèñÊï∞ÊçÆÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫ÂÆÉÁöÑÊ†ºÂºè‰∏çÊ≠£Á°Æ | When you have to book a reservation, it‚Äôs very easy, one click , submit , it‚Äôs all over. 
Now, when you wanna cancel a reservation it‚Äôs endless loop of questions that don‚Äôt make any sense , on and on and on. This is not a problem only with Airbnb only but it‚Äôs a problem with wast majority of apps out there. It‚Äôs pathetic and it‚Äôs straight up insulting. Never again. | it is THE WORST customer service experience of any app. they use a call center in India, that is probably a room of 500 people, all talking at the same time, so you can not hear your representative. the representatives barely speak any English, so you can not understand anything they say. imagine, you are calling probably one of the worst places in the world for customer service.
try it for yourself. | I‚Äôve used this app to host and stay. Their customer service is extremely useless in helping hosts and guests with stays. There‚Äôs no accountability from AIRBnB and they are quick to give you a run around. They don‚Äôt count a ton of small black hairs on a bed as UNSANITARY! Disgusting. Save yourself the nightmare and don‚Äôt use AIRbnb. | My sisters and I used is app to book a home for our vacation. The listing was not at all as described, advertised as a whole home and it was an old messy upstairs unit of a multifamily complex. Our review and the people who booked below us were both negative and AirBnB removed all negative reviews. Shady customer service and shady hosts ruin this platform. | My most recent stay in Kissimmee Florida had roaches an Airbnb did nothing about it. I submitted photos of the roaches an they told me verbatim we are sorry but we can only give you a 10% refund for the first night. Which is $13. Pathetic | I had an issue with one of the Airbnb I booked and didn‚Äôt get no help at all they were keep hanging up my call or transferring it to each other and asking me the same questions. The customer service is run in a third party so good luck getting any help. Really bad experience. | If you want to go for cheap renovations, old funky furniture, sketchy entrances and no assistance come here!
Aibnb offers no customer support. If you have terrible host or a terrible experience Airbnb will offer you no help, they will stand for the host, and if the host do no want to cancel or refund you will have to take the financial damage or ruin your trip.
Save yourself stress and disappointment, book a hotel, they have someone at the door 24h, professional service, and customer service.

I am someone who travels very often, I am NEVER using Airbnb again. | !!! Airbnb takes days and opens and closes support cases within hours without solving anything! They also commit to calling you back but never do! It just continues and continues in a loop! There is no protection for airbnb hosts whatsoever when an Airbnb guest starts acting abusive! 

Non! 

Airbnb has acted in a way that leaves me no doubt that they wanted the situation to escalate to a point where they expect the hosts to refund everything to solve the issue‚Ä¶ 

Instead of Airbnb solving the issue!! 

So they pressure you by letting the conflict fester and escalate - hoping you will just refund the guest!

Instead of airbnb relocating the guest and covering the cost!!!!! 

Airbnb will do everything to save money!!

Their customer service is NON-Existent! 

Don‚Äôt use this platform anymore | I had called in a safety concern with a host trying to use a 3rd party app to communicate then put me in a group chat with other people and sent my entry information with strangers. Called Airbnb they said that is a safety concern and we should give you a refund but the case keep getting shifted to other case managers. A case manager named Sue sent a message and said she was on it but just waited till her shift was over to pass it to the next person. At 4 am the next shift manager called and when I didn't answer they closed the case. Watch out because the company is very shady in their actions. | If you ever plan on booking any type of reservations with this company, DONT! For quite some time my gf and I had planned to book an air bnb with one of the clients online. When it came time to actually make the reservations, the amount of HOOPS we had to jump through, ONLY to waste money AND STILL not get the reservation. Situation got ‚Äúescalated‚Äù but NEVER resolved. Company wont even TRY to reimburse you for money spent or close account as customer requested! HORRIBLE SERVICE!  WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK! Not another reservation for days we dont have planned for.  IM WARNING YOU ALL DONT USE IT! | Hands down the worst customer service I have ever received. | I‚Äôve been using Airbnb for the past 8 years and although I‚Äôve had some questionable airbnbs here and there, I generally liked it. However recently, I‚Äôve had the most difficult time with Airbnb due to sudden reservation cancelations from Airbnb, and then getting banned for the vague reason of ‚Äúsomeone associated with my account cannot use Airbnb‚Äù. After contacting them multiple times, I still get no clear answer as to why the ban occurred and they have yet to compensate me for the reservation they cancelled 3 days before the reservation date! I would expect customer service to get better over the years, not worse! Better take your business elsewhere since you‚Äôll never know when you‚Äôll get banned out of nowhere. It happens to hosts as well. | This site is ran by computers not people. I have perfect history and several rental‚Äôs over several years all excellent reviews. Recently when trying to make a reservation I was flagged as party risk . They deleted my account causing me to lose the reservation I had just made and a reservation I had for months for my daughters prom . I emailed them and they immediately reinstated account but property for prom was gone . Next I rebooked the house the caused the original issue . They then closed my account again and now say they will not reinstate. Please boycott this site my daughter is devestated along with all her friends | This platform has gone down the drain.  We used to love using it but the last four listings we have tried to book have turned out to be scam listings that did not actually exist!

We have move on to VRBO and will never be back! | I had booked my bachelorette trip in Nashville several months in advanced to when I was going. When we did we book it we payed an extra to make sure we would be able to cancel if needed because this was going to be a lot of money. Fast forward to our plans changing in a big way and now we won‚Äôt be able to make this trip happen. It‚Äôs still three months before the trip was scheduled and we have paid half(2780$) and we were told we weren‚Äôt eligible for the refund. Super frustrating because we were even led to believe that we would be able to get that refund and it was 3 months ahead of time. | What they‚Äôre doing to the hosting side is despicable. It is getting harder to host with the new interface, please fix. | The host didn't tell me that I needed to sign a short term lease agreement so I declined to sign it and according to the policy if I host does not tell you that you have to sign a short term lease agreement before booking, the host has to refound all money without penalties so these scam company didn't make the host to return my money. I lost a total of $2000 beware and protect your money book at the hotel.";4.77888;630729;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/dd/18/5b/dd185ba4-eaf9-4723-8f1e-ef81256b6702/affe9d16-12fb-4e90-bd72-2aef6db64875_A-iPhone-55-1_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/37/c7/65/37c76512-ed84-9f33-9abd-c2ff89cd82d4/aa7d1730-888d-4d4c-8740-072743767f11_A-iPhone-55-2_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/be/10/87/be1087a7-7ddc-643e-0eb2-248031384145/c4c9b288-b49a-463d-a76f-65b74ddf2689_A-iPhone-55-3_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f8/b6/b9/f8b6b9e2-195b-f4ef-cc7e-97438c2d53de/75604421-7b0a-43d5-bcd7-b3ca0ad853cd_A-iPhone-55-4_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/16/ae/a4/16aea4b8-8aff-de00-5938-b27c4985aae7/621b1af3-ef01-48c2-b187-fc48c27fd6af_A-iPhone-55-5_en-US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/21/ae/6b/21ae6b47-4614-3551-aafb-e56015930660/92b9924c-eb2c-44bf-b6d3-dc9b319a013f_A-iPhone-55-6_en-US.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/99/d8/f0/99d8f0ad-31f8-6485-5651-e9b2dbfed177/2dd66dcd-28d7-4f52-a6c0-042cdb24fbc1_iPad-1_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/63/2a/03/632a03a3-7657-a304-89b1-2676ff054eee/172d6926-d10f-4027-972f-e5e2c9175158_iPad-2_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7d/f6/5a/7df65a00-67f3-15bc-c7bb-1f3d3bdbb745/755327b4-e398-42dd-9b06-46a1067e23a1_iPad-3_en-US.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f5/b9/55/f5b9555f-033b-c4a5-f54d-ab347b4411cf/7ea8755e-16f5-42b5-b865-e019cb12fc58_iPad-4_en-US.png/552x414bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I‚Äôm totally impressed. | I have almost 4 million seat miles on AA.  I use this for every trip business and personal.  Saves a ton of time and it organizes everything involved in travel.  It‚Äôs awesome. | This travel app is absolutely amazing!
Create a trip and send confirmation emails to input!  Helps you catch errors, make sure you have no gaps, etc. includes all transportations, reservations, lodging etc with all the info you need in it. | Was seriously loving this app to plan a big trip with the family. Lots of planes, trains, hotels to keep track of. Once I realized the max PDF files was 3 with the free version I immediately upgraded to Pro to then only find out that they once again maxed out at 25 uploads. Geez‚Ä¶. It was my main reason for paying! | This is the best app ever I shared it with two friends that are not Internet savvy, and they are very excited to use this for their upcoming European trip.  My friend and I are able to share our updates and I love the expansions on each location that provides more detail that we don‚Äôt have to look up. I do wish they could add some sort of budget where you could see the total of your budget at the top or something but other than that it‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs a great app they can be used with, anything you‚Äôre doing on your trip and I love the chronological order | I‚Äôve been using KAYAK for a while to plan and share trip information, but it isn‚Äôt a perfect tool, so I thought I‚Äôd try TripIt for a while. 

It is easy to add your plans to TripIt, just forward it reservation emails; Kayak does this too. You can also enter or change details manually. Tripit is somewhat better than kayak for this. 

With TripIt, it is easy to share a trip with participants who can update the trip with you (e.g. one person works on transportation, another on lodging, etc). The whole trip collaboration thing is easier with TripIt than KAYAK. 

The subscribed calendar support in KAYAK is much better than TripIt. With KAYAK you can see all your trips, including flights and lodging, on your device calendar. I can easily see how my trips fit into all my other plans. Other people can see my trips on their calendars too. I just share a calendar link with friends and family so they can see where I am and how to reach me on their own device calendars without using the kayak app at all; they like that. 

Tripit also supports subscribed calendars, but doesn‚Äôt include the detailed plans. This is a showstopper for me; it should be straightforward for TripIt to improve their support, but until they do, I‚Äôll stick with KAYAK. | My account has an odd email added to it, and with every click I get an error. It‚Äôs been less then 10 min since downloading it and I want out | I‚Äôve used this app for years and never cease to be impressed by how easy it makes keeping track of travel plans.  Especially because I travel a lot. | This app makes organizing travel simple. I email my confirmations to the app and it organizes my itineraries. I‚Äôve planned complicated itineraries for a few weeks in Europe with tour guides, show tickets, hotels, drivers, trains and planes.  The app keeps it all organized and recommends options near where I‚Äôll be. It‚Äôs really awesome. | I love this app. | I love having all of my trip information in one place. I also appreciate the refund feature for flights if the price goes down. I will upgrade my stars when the app knows when I send a cancellation email that the trip information is to be upgraded accordingly. Also, the connection time is deceiving because it doesn‚Äôt take into account when a flight boards, only when it departs. | Been a subscribed user for as long as I could remember. This app is my trusted and favorite travel companion. Highly Recommended. | How can anyone travel without this app? All you do is email your itinerary with whatever on It (airplane, hotel, rental car, tours...) it automatically separates everything and puts it all order Gives you updates on your flight and when it's time to check in. Also gives you option to locate airport lounges or even alternate flights if your plans change. Fantastic app. | I like much of what Tripit does. My big problem is that it does not capture all of my trips. Which makes it useless some of the time. Perhaps I‚Äôm doing something wrong but not sure how to fix it. | Love the app.  Makes it so easy to keep all the details of a trip organized. 
A suggestion would be to allow me add my wife as a second traveler on a trip. | Have been using TripIt for business and personal travel for years. So convenient. Flights, cruises, car rentals, lodging, and restaurant reservations all in one place for easy one stop access. One tap and I can review all my future travel plans. Sometimes I get flight updates before the airline app notifications. I forward info to others as needed and can still put it all in my calendar. But having it all in one place is great. | I was expecting a lot more beyond pulling reservation information from my emails the app doesn‚Äôt offer much in addition. I expected it would provide directions from one hotel to the next without having to retype the addresses of each. | TripIt is my favorite travel app. I don‚Äôt know how they do what they do, but they always beat the airlines when it comes to providing flight delays, cancellations, and gate change notifications. if you travel a lot, TripIt Pro definitely is worth it. | TripIt pushes status notices and delay information to me so I don‚Äôt have to go to the Airline site | I really want to use this app, but I can‚Äôt even create an account.  It asks for me to put in my Home City, but when I enter it I keep getting an error.  The type goes red and it doesn‚Äôt accept my entry. | I Love Tripit ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

I love how it puts everything of my trip in order and according to the correct time, plus much more. My flights, car rentals, hotels, even extra events which don‚Äôt have email confirmations, e.g. ‚ÄúDinner with Mary at 6pm‚Äù.  Tripit has simplified my life and lowered my stress level. ü§ó

Thank you Tripit. | Really good way to keep details of a trip organized. | Fantastic app keeps all my information in order. Lodging information, tours, rental cars all with phone numbers, prices, confirmation numbers all in one place. The mapping function was invaluable. | This app is great. My only complaint is the max # of attachments. It allows only 20 pics and/or docs attached to any one itinerary in the PRO version. I easily max this out on a trip with more than 8 days. And then I have to use other ways to track down my excursion tickets and reservations, etc. 
Make PRO unlimited please. | I used the free version and decided to upgrade to pro when it went on sale. I use this for my trip from California to Vietnam, this is an amazing app that I would highly recommend to everyone traveling! | All you need is this super user friendly app to put together all you trips and activities. Love how easy it is to use the app and how up to date with airlines they are. I also love their response rate on tech support. Best money spent on any app. | This was one of the top rated trip organizers, but downloading the app, I couldn‚Äôt create a new account. Going to the website, couldn‚Äôt create new account. In both instances, it tried  to match the details I entered to an existing account‚Ä¶ which doesn‚Äôt exist yet!  Then it wanted me to log in using Google, only for the exact same thing to happen. I don‚Äôt have time for this sort of nonsense and I no longer trust this is a safe or secure website or app. | I have been using this for years & don‚Äôt know what I would do without it. It makes traveling so easy with all the information at your fingertips. It‚Äôs so easy to forward itineraries & it imports them perfectly. Best ever! | I‚Äôve been using this app for several years. I have been a general user and a Pro user at different times. I don‚Äôt see much benefit in being a Pro user. Airport maps can be googled, and I‚Äôm not sure what the other ‚ÄúPro‚Äù benefits are, but it‚Äôs not much different from using the app without that.

It is nice to have all my travel stuff in one place, but I used the Notes app to keep track before I had TripIt; TripIt does save a little time, when it works. Unfortunately it‚Äôs ‚Äúimport plans‚Äù feature doesn‚Äôt work a lot of the time, even when you would think it would, like when you make a reservation to park at LAX like thousands of people do every week. (I reported this over a month ago and it still has not been fixed)

Anyway, in my opinion the app is worth using, but the Pro benefits are not worth paying for. | When I traveled to Europe on a two month trip last fall, TripIt kept me organized and sane. I moved around to many locations and my itinerary was constantly changing. I don‚Äôt know how I possibly could have kept all the details straight without TripIt‚Äôs help, For me, it‚Äôs an essential in my toolbox. | Works well, it helps me keep all of trip details in one location. Very effective for my 10 day multi-city vacation and works well with other apps. Easy to send my itinerary to the app. | Love Tripit!!!! | My husband and I travel a ton. I travel a lot for work, and then we travel with our two young children multiple times a year. I used to maintain Google docs and manually update all the details to make sure we had a stress free trip. This replaces all that manual work, and it‚Äôs SO CONVENIENT to see everything in one place, in chronological order. Sometimes it even gives more information than you get from the airline apps. I can‚Äôt tell you the number of times my husband and I talk about how great this app is. It‚Äôs literally every trip. Our last trip my husband said he‚Äôd delete the mail app on his phone before he‚Äôd delete trip it. Just download it. There is nothing better out there. | Love this app. Keeps all my trip info in one place, easy to use as well. | I subscribed to the pro version now and this has been a great help over the years. Let‚Äôs you keep your trip very organized and an unexpected benefit has been able to go back and look up a trip in the past and sometimes has reminded me of things I had forgotten, I‚Äôve never had a ride to customer service yet which is a great thing in and of itself and there seems to be constant improvements. | This is great! | I have been using TripIt as an important part of my travel planning & execution since 2010. The free version offers a lot of value and I held off on paid subscription for a long time but started paying last year and enjoying the benefits inc. Inner Circle feature so I don‚Äôt have to manually share every trip with my family every time. Big supporter of TripIt over the past 14 years. | The continuous log in cycle never ends so what‚Äôs the point of the app if I‚Äôm never able to actually log in to use it? | We‚Äôre full time travelers and use TRIP IT to remind us of upcoming trips, hotel stays, auto rental locations etc. It‚Äôs super friendly, easy to use and allows us to communicate our plans to family keeping them informed of changes. Highly recommend. A PLUS, it keeps track of changes on flight schedules and let‚Äôs us know when we can upgrade seats. | This app is impossible to set up, clunky to try and use, and gets everything wrong. I have no idea why anyone would want to use it. Just worthless. | We usually have multiple trips in a year and it helps us to keep everything organized for each trip. We‚Äôve also enjoyed the upgraded version with real time flight info and airport information! | I‚Äôve used TripIt for years and really don‚Äôt know how people with packed travel plans do without it. Last year it kept our 12 Country itinerary with flights, nights and car and tours organized‚Ä¶at our fingertips 24 hours a day. Previous I carried all that info of hand written or printed stuff in a old fashioned fanny pack so I wouldn‚Äôt loose it. Just try TripIt and you will never travel the same again! | Worthless if you want share with family or travelers. They admit it doesn‚Äôt work; false advertising! | Based on my experience with the free version I'm going to get a pro subscription. If you travel a few times a year try the free and you'll see how great it is | Love the app, still learning how to use it. But it is crashing frequently and I have to exit the app and restart it. | TripIt has been fantastic to use. Organizing all aspects of a trip in one place is a tremendous time saver, instead of searching for a reservation time or place. I also use it to record events during a trip to answer future questions like: what was that great restaurant in Louisville that had the great steaks? | Over the past few weeks I have uninstalled and re-installed this app countless times, closed out the app, signed out of the app. All the while using the internet on my phone for countless other tasks.  Everytime I open this app it tells me I have no internet connection.  When I am able to get into my trips, I have multiple duplicate entries created by some bug within the program.  I have contacted customer service and have been told to sign out, close, or re-install the app, with no other help or options as to how to fix the issue.  I would stay away from this app.  It will most certainly make trip planning more difficult, as well as cause unnecessary confusion. | TripIt alerted me to a lower airfare. I saved $240 it paid for TripIt pro and money left over I love this app. üòé | Having all my travel parts united in one interface, with links to addresses, confirmation codes, dates, alerts, etc is so nice, how did I travel before TripIt?? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòé | I love TripIt! I use it for all my travel and I travel a lot! It‚Äôs so convenient to be able to forward an email and information gets automatically put on itinerary. Everything from flight, hotel, car rental, restaurant reservations, tours, or cruise information can easily be entered. If there‚Äôs anything to improve, sometimes information gets sent to wrong itinerary so I usually have to double check and move information to correct itinerary. It wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if just planning one trip but I‚Äôm usually planning multiple trips at a time. I also like that I can share itinerary w others. I think it would be nice that if anyone I sent it to made changes it would only change on their end and not mine. I usually have flight information for whole family so it would be nice if same flight information can have multiple confirmation numbers with a spot for their name and seats. Sometimes itineraries I try to share through app do not always get sent so I find it easier to log in on website and share link so that they receive it. I love that with flight numbers the flight information gets put in automatically too.Overall, still my favorite travel app. With a few improvements it can be more amazing.";4.83057;252796;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/44/84/dd/4484dd9e-b4f0-5cbc-7984-29404cc25859/d7a9199f-e496-4b7c-85f9-b8673b8533f6_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_02_3Dview.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/38/ae/b4/38aeb472-f3a1-0cd5-49d2-1c181335c3cb/d76414fa-ee05-4892-b568-a8e1a85a1c82_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_01_3Dview.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3e/bc/87/3ebc87c7-f40e-449b-63f2-d07101252a99/ca4783cf-14ec-4d9c-8e38-2a364be5b97c_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_03_trips.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ea/66/9b/ea669b55-3105-1b9a-b65b-eea45fa858e7/00348545-1f82-4d86-9a6e-c111bf6afda0_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_04_richNotification.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ea/75/e2/ea75e2a8-68c7-d5d9-d656-909e2aba9e9b/de4c4663-a7c3-4461-8419-ad1c761b908b_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_05_documents.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/45/82/e3/4582e362-0dd8-6652-384a-fc3c1ec27f32/5a8fc574-44ba-49a9-9e7b-4892ef67c4ec_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_06_covidGuidance.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/24/23/0d/24230d91-a849-b769-fc9a-6a1035df5d09/c43fa9d8-6811-47ea-82f6-687481d7b00f_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_07_nearbyCafe.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ae/f4/1d/aef41d67-fa33-a28f-f0dd-f4475e5d1453/00510263-d923-4089-b067-dd7e4b738336_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_08_goNow.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/74/3b/20/743b20e0-22b5-8cc8-93e2-455fd971edcf/95fc5405-2810-4956-b256-fc08f1a08361_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_09_carbonEmissions.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/eb/e1/91/ebe19193-fd51-1935-40d2-b745d1c51c66/60861d2f-7c24-40a8-8d39-c1f0bd3b74fd_en-US_iPhone_8_Plus_10_travelStats.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/3e/08/0d/3e080d09-7551-699b-eec4-9f7a266bbe1b/691f71b2-567d-4cce-bf00-5c81bbb80675_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_01_3Dview.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/95/9d/31/959d3146-6272-4989-aa32-404f1807fe11/a924415f-7729-4e6f-a453-c49924c3cb34_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_02_3Dview.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/12/9f/ab/129fab5a-eba4-3a8f-0e53-f7dcc73f2a58/36a720c5-fb0a-43d2-b91c-b098f320a6e4_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_03_trips.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/02/89/16/028916f4-9967-7cf5-9043-88068a485713/beac644f-cd5c-44c9-a3bb-abafcbe886d2_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_04_richNotification.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/39/af/f9/39aff9a5-a14a-fcda-7bd0-c5a3b89a5507/972a7571-7404-4751-a2c7-16927fdb2dd8_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_05_documents.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/69/24/63/6924631d-6560-0923-8a95-eecf4b1f38a9/86a5787c-f67f-4c5e-9025-e70ecf34fac3_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_06_covidGuidance.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ce/b5/8d/ceb58dec-bd36-f4f3-9571-a6b4232b50d1/d80954bd-e4b8-4474-9d6e-77c223f8acac_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_07_nearbyCafe.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/a9/38/49/a938498a-6d0f-63c9-ca88-d76d4cbaa9df/88f2b997-77c7-42d4-beb7-fed7442512d9_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_08_goNow.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/63/84/ee/6384ee54-775a-9547-9b94-0ac7dd0551e3/d61a59bd-4b9e-4247-8c8f-5dd865ce7aa3_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_09_carbonEmissions.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/4a/ac/41/4aac41c2-7909-d3d4-1881-0c6559ad9d6d/741ba7fb-0fc4-4e8c-acd8-87dcde53b4bb_en-US_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_10_travelStats.png/552x414bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iP

Zooming close enough to clearly see borders is frustrating on very small island countries. | If I purchase Visited Pro version, is it gonna be a monthly or yearly subscription? What additional features will be available? | STAY AWAY!! This app supports consumption of endangered species and exploitation of native cultures.  Travel apps are fun, and there are many many others that don‚Äôt do this. Choose a different one. | Can you please make the country flag size bigger. | I have never wrote a review EVER‚Ä¶ but this may be the WORST app I have ever gotten in my life. Very frustrating to work. I LITERALLY had to type where I lived over 5 times. I could not get passed it no matter what. I just want a simple app that tracks the places I‚Äôve been. Do NOT DOWNLOAD. | Nothing saves when I put it into the app. I emailed them months ago no response. Waste of money and I would like it back | Just keeps asking me what country I live in and what city. When hit next, it asks the same question. It‚Äôs an endless loop. | You have to pay the monthly subscription fee to even add the places you‚Äôve been. | This app is great for travel and aspirational travel planning. Lots of cool features, I ended up paying for the full package. Tech support was fast and helpful when I had an issue. | Love this app! I just wish it had some better options and visuals for sharing maps and progress with friends and on social media. | The best thing about this App is that the owner actually responds to multiple request to add cities!  Easy and fun way to track my visits to 54 countries to date‚Ä¶. Including many non-tourist destinations. | It used to be you zoom in and see the subdivisions of the country. They got rid of that and now you have to click the country, then click a few other things. Nowhere near as seamless. Please bring the old functionality back! | The site keeps asking me to update where I live and won‚Äôt do anything else. | I have fun marking off places I have visited and being able to see my progress.  Also, the developers are great, as I have provided feedback and content and the team updates the app as needed.  Great job! | How is possible that you has to agree to receive thousands of emails that you don‚Äôt want to use the app? Plus has to pay extra for add remove but no email scam chain? Blame on you. | Sorry, if I can‚Äôt even try the app without signing up for an email list, it is a non-starter. I should not be required to sign up for marketing junk mail before I even know if I like the app. If this gets fixed/changed then maybe I could give a better rating. | I have been traveling a lot in recent years & decided I wanted to start logging locations. This was the 2nd app I decided to try, but I couldn‚Äôt even get past the set up because it required me to choose my home city off a list that didn‚Äôt contain my home city. It did not offer any way to manually enter my home city, and no way to bypass that selection. So, needless to say, I deleted the app. | Recommend multiple family profiles so kids are encouraged to discover as much/more as their parents | The app doesn‚Äôt load | This app looks so cool, but when I try to sign up, there is an error that pops up on the screen. I used different emails too. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong!

EDIT: The app is super helpful. The customer support was amazing. Thank you! | Well I‚Äôd like to review this app for its features or literally anything but I can‚Äôt even use it. I try to make an account and it won‚Äôt get off the loading screen. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times. | Loved this app. But won‚Äôt load since the update yesterday! | I had been using this app and enjoyed it, but logged in today to a screen asking me to agree to a privacy policy. There was an additional checkbox asking permission for the app to send me promotional mail. I left it unchecked and submitted and was greeted with ‚ÄúWhoops! You must accept everything or delete your account. The two buttons to proceed were literally ‚Äúok‚Äù and ‚Äúdelete account‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt say ok. How insulting | Buggy. I downloaded this app and after 15 minutes of trying to see the scratched countries, I gave up. All I could see was a yellow dot where I live. I changed the water color and the whole map changed to that color except for the yellow dot. Waste of time. | Got this app to log the places I‚Äôve traveled to and even bought the almost $10 packet which includes no ads, unlocks cities, regions etc., of where you‚Äôve traveled. However, every time I wanted to save a city for example in Mexico, I wanted to log Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Tulum.. it would not save no matter how many times I pressed the BEEN button. Even restarted my phone to make sure the issue was not on my end.

Please fix this! | I liked the app but even after you pay to get rid of the ads they force you to subscribe to advertising email list.  It‚Äôs either subscribe or delete your account, the only options, I deleted my account t.  I got fooled. | Seriously? 8.99 for this? You can not even exporta decent picture of where you have been in the map. | Useless if you‚Äôve only traveled domestically. | I‚Äôve tried multiple times, and even deleted the app, reinstalled it, and still no luck. | Get ready to be spammed. They sell your email and all sorts of weird malicious spam starts reaching out to you | This is a good way to keep track of world travels. It works great. | Just trying to record countries visited not give you all my info. Ugh. | So it good with the countries. I was trying to update cities I been and lived and it would let me add. It only updates countries. It also isn‚Äôt user friendly. I have to re-teach myself how to reset the city I currently live (still not accurate on my app). Also, something I can get over if the city updates work, is it has plenty of Territories as separate counties which love, but it picks and chooses which ones (such as Canadian territories not being separated from the country) and it also doesn‚Äôt acknowledge all disputed territory very well. For example Morocco on it‚Äôs map has territory that isn‚Äôt part of it, it is UN accurate, but if your going UN accurate, then a territories shouldn‚Äôt be separate. So Puerto Rico is part of the United States and not independent. I do prefer that it separates it. But I am annoyed that it picks and chooses for you who owns what land. To be honest I wouldn‚Äôt have even cared about most of this if the upgrades I paid for actually worked. | Have to enter cities and countries twice. For example; entering city as Barcelona in Spain won‚Äôt show Spain as a country visited. You must enter the country as a different entry. Not worth $8 or anything. A waste. | The app itself is fine. But to use it you must accept terms that you accept unlimited spam from them and their partners. There are other apps that don‚Äôt do that. There are plenty of websites that do not for free. | This app REQUIRES you to sign up and forces subscription (says you can op-out at anytime).

You can NOT op-out.  Apple should remove this app as a scam to customers. | I downloaded the app because it also has the list of places, food, capitals, parks, etc.  Unfortunately, the app is missing the option to filter searches. When searching for cities in the US, it shows a list of all the cities in alphabetical order and not by state - it would‚Äôve been convenient to filter the cities by state in addition to having a search. Also, when selecting the destinations visited under the list tab, it does not filter lista by ‚Äúbeen‚Äù or ‚Äúwant to visit‚Äù. | This is a good app and I even paid to remove ads and to unlock all the features. HOWEVER, it needs to give more control to the user. They collect so much of your personal information. It‚Äôs like either use it and let us collect these information, or leave it. Also, I was forced to sign up to their newsletter. It said I can withdraw from their newsletter at anytime but there is no option for that in the map. I paid for the premium features but you know what? Don‚Äôt. None of the premium features were worth it. Let me start off by cities. You can type and choose the cities that you‚Äôve been to and cities that you want to visit. But that is it. You can‚Äôt even see a list of those cities that you want to visit, let alone a map of it. Looks like they made it easy for them to collect our information. Inspiration doesn‚Äôt have anything. It said it would show travel photos. The only photo it shows is the thumbnail when you select from want/been. If you do download this app, please do go to privacy section and read the ‚ÄúWhat personal information do we collect?‚Äù Section. So far, what a waste of money it has been. If it gets improved, I will update my review. | After you setup your account, the app requires you to both (1) accept their privacy policy and (2) agree to receive marketing emails from them. If you do not do both, it offers a ‚ÄúDelete Account‚Äù option. If you choose that, it then tries to charge you $2.99, rather than simply deleting your data. | Absolutely cool, only one issue though; There should be an option for the places you have lived and where you are currently living to be different. | Be prepared to pay $8.99 the ONLY feature you get for free is to select your countries visited. All other content is to be paid for. There are tons of apps out there for free that will give you that. Save your money. | Can I change the email address associated with my account? | I love this app bec it lets me track the places I have been and gives me stats on the travel I have done ! | Love the app except for 1 part. It doesn‚Äôt show the different countries for the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are all separate countries and should be counted as such. | App is trash and waste of time | The app seemed interesting. I downloaded it, installed it launched it. First thing that comes up it  asks for your email. App immediately uninstalled. When will developers learn that people don‚Äôt want to be violated to use their app? | X
  You job is uddvthyqhayhjia  ( f | Enjoying the new update with all of the new lists, but was hoping to have the National Parks list ONLY contain the 63 national parks and not all of the other preserves, lakeshores, etc. Would also be nice to have a total count number with the overall percentage that‚Äôs being listed. | I lost my previous traveling data once I had select the option for cities. I preferred states, not cities. I will not resubscribe. | Paid for the upgrade to realize that there are missing and incorrect cities. What‚Äôs the point of having an app that helps you track your travels when not all options available. My countries and cities list is completely off in comparison to another app I have.

Will probably be booking directly with individual hotel rewards programs in the future.  Disappointing, as I like the benefit of finding numerous hotels of the right price range through Hotels.com | Does not let me change my email address. I tried 5 times. So it continues to spam my email inbox | On the app icon on my phone, the notification numbers won‚Äôt go away no matter what I do. For this OCD person, it‚Äôs annoying and I am about to delete the app. | Since last Friday, my booked hotel didn‚Äôt show up, it disappeared! I tried reinstalled the app but still didn‚Äôt work, and the website too, it says ‚Äú something wrong went with our end!‚Äù I can‚Äôt change the days or cancel any trips or even check the details of the hotel I booked! Terrible ! | $98 a night, actually $330 after fees LOL | I‚Äôve used this app for several years. It no longer functions-I haven‚Äôt been able to login. | Heater did not work properly and it was cold in the room.

OK‚Ä¶but the MBR isn‚Äôt. The Queen bed mattress needs to be replaced. There are a plant stand and rickety bookshelf for bedside tables and no dresser. The desk has no chair and the glider chair that is in there is from the ‚Äò60‚Äôs at best. We also need instructions for the TV. We could only get ABC, and that was after multiple tries. 
Please accept this as it is meant - suggestions for improvement. | Lately this app won‚Äôt show me anything. I have to go online to see things | App keeps freezing when i search for a hotel or stay and then i can‚Äôt go back i have to completely exit the app. | It‚Äôs very difficult to do simple things with this app. I can‚Äôt change my email because the app keeps saying ‚Äúsomething went wrong on our end‚Äù - this happens whether I attempt through the website on my laptop, iPad, or iPhone. It took me nearly 2 hours to cancel a reservation. The link in the email/itinerary did not work and connected to a non-functioning page. When I tried to cancel through the app and clicked on the reservation, it took me to another sign-in page/create account page for a hotel in Indianapolis (which is where I was staying), and then generated an additional error message when I tried to create an additional count through that site just so I could manage/cancel the trip. I then called the hotel personally, only to be connected to someone who barely spoke English and could not understand me well, either. (I realize hotels.com has no control over this, but it still adds to the ordeal). After several minutes of repeated questions, he finally tells me the reservation is cancelled and not to worry, then hangs up before giving me any sort of reference number. I kept checking the app, but it does not show the reservation cancelled. I finally tried the virtual agent and this person was able to cancel the trip. However, the agent promised to send an email with details of the cancellation, and the email never arrived. At the very least the trip shows that its cancelled in the app, but I still want an email as proof in case my credit card is mistakenly charged. | Between these book online sites and global hotel chains it has become very difficult for a independent hotel chain to make it. Expedia charges the hotels huge fees and picks the winners. Why can we no longer see hotels on google maps and other organic searches? This is the real question. | I was just advised that Hotels.com has not even initiated the refund process.  I can only talk to a bot.  Unacceptable | This and Expedia keeps freezing on me. | Can‚Äôt use hotel.com gift cards on hardly any of the hotels they list. We got a gift card for our wedding and I spent FOREVER looking and finally just settled on one that finally took it. Can‚Äôt use one-key cash earned if you‚Äôre using a gift card. Lastly, I can‚Äôt even open my reservation to look at it since I booked 4 days ago-a message that says ‚Äúoops, something went wrong‚Äù immediately pops up. It‚Äôs an easy tool to research hotels in the area you want to stay but I wouldn‚Äôt book using their app again. And I certainly wouldn‚Äôt add hotel.com gift cards to any registry in the future. | After the update I have two notifications in the messages part of the app that I cannot clear. These say they are new but they are old reservations from last year.   Because of this I had to delete the app | They have been horrible.. not what is advertised.. last reservation suite was not under construction. | I stopped using this as my go to when they greatly lowered the rewards program, which plunged by about 80%. | Terrible app for Hotels.com. It will not let me log on to my account. There is no knowledge assistance available to resolve this issue on Hotels.com. Get your act together! | They will rob you‚Ä¶ paid 200$ for a 87$ hotel and all they said was prices change every 5 mins lol | Web Sayfanƒ±zda, kullanƒ±m kolaylƒ±ƒüƒ± olmayan bir d√ºzen var.

So easy to use, and manage and great rewards! | Unable to change my email, I unable to use my old email, it keep sending the code in the old email, can it be sent on my phone | They have completely devalued their rewards program and it‚Äôs no longer worth using this site, sorry to say goodbye after so many years.

Who all are you using now that they have gone in the toilet? | Ever since ownership of Hotels changed, I lost the free rooms I had acquired. Not likely to use this site anymore and I use to use it exclusively when I traveled including when traveling to Europe. | This is a rip off app. Have been using it for years and just realized when you choose to pay at the hotel the price you pay at the hotel is way more than the price you agreed when you purchased it on the app. 

I reported this to Hotels.com and was told I would receive a response within 72 hours and never received anything. So when you were buying online through this app, you are not getting the price they are advertising. It is false advertising. It needs to be reported to the attorney general and Better Business Bureau do not buy from this app anymore. | I have used Hotels.com for over ten years thanks to their stay ten nights get one free. They‚Äôve switched to One Key Cash and it‚Äôs like throwing penny‚Äôs at me for using your company to book hotels. I will be using hotel points from now on. One Key Cash does not make it worth it to stay loyal. | Have a pet friendly symbol on the hotels opening page . It is often difficult to find out if they are or aren‚Äôt | Pre-visit communication was terrible.  Couldn‚Äôt get any info or even the address until the day of the stay

Very difficult to book and upload drivers license and related docs 

Couldn‚Äôt get anyone to return phone calls

Accommodations were fine but the booking was not great or definitely not user friendly | Buenas noches reservamos en el hotel Catalonya y que groser√≠a de hotel, la comida p√©sima, el ambiente de entretenimiento a los adultos una verg√ºenza nunca volver√© a utilizar este medio como agente de turismo | When their app screws up they do nothing to help their customer - they book you at hotels that have no room. You arrive and the hotel says sorry they do this all the time. Then you talk to India for three hours trying to get. A refund. You put in filters that have criteria, they book you. You show up and the hotel tells you sorry - they still refuse to make things right. This is the absolute worst company - all Expedia companies are terrible don‚Äôt use them | I read a hotel room there that was supposed to be there at 1:30 in the morning. I show up at 1:30 in the morning after driving eight hours hoping to get some sleep because I had to be up at 10 I get there no one answers for an hour and a half I call Hotels.com. They‚Äôre pretty much show me there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it so after crying, and affected by my PTSD because of this, I ended up going to bed at 7 o‚Äôclock in the morning after driving an hour and they still wanted me to pay $50 towards the hotel after everything that I went through these are people that are hearing my story. I‚Äôm crying I‚Äôm telling them that I can‚Äôt drive the hour. I can‚Äôt even I could barely drive the 130 to get there, and they really didn‚Äôt care they were upset because I even had to get the hotel after calling back to hopefully get my money back, which is the least they could do Their staff was uncompassionate. They didn‚Äôt care and told me well you stayed in a hotel after all please I am please do not use this service. And I must add there‚Äôs so much more to this story, but this has happened one time before but do you know where I slept that day in my car and after that I lost $100 and they still didn‚Äôt want to do anything about it? These people are awful. | Lame company, One Key does not make it easy | App works perfect - kudos to the engineers. The marketing and loyalty team should be disbanded. The new program is atrocious and has me running to big corp groups like Marriott & Hyatt. It takes forever to earn a dollar in this new system.

I paid $140 in baggage fees and only received 2 bags. Scammers . | I liked! | I feel like this is a scam site. Over this last year that I‚Äôve had the app, I‚Äôve attempted to purchase tickets at the cheap price displayed. And every time I have clicked to make payment, the very next window shows an increased price. 

This is not because the prices go up immediately‚Ä¶ because I had my wife then use her computer to go to the site/app and she would still see the lower price, therefore it‚Äôs not increased. It only increases once they know you‚Äôre interested in the flight and click to pay. As an example, a flight that was approximately $200 each. Once we put in our payment info and tried to pay, the total was just under $700‚Ä¶ the flights that I‚Äôve attempted to book all jumped in total price by 300% to 400%. 

Again, this site / app feels like a scam and I‚Äôm concerned with how they get your payment info and only then they give this highly inflated total. 

I have this app in my phone under the label of Scam.  I won‚Äôt trust them and I‚Äôve told others to stay away from it.

I even typed ‚Äústore‚Äù into the search bar, but it just said ‚Äúno results‚Äù.  Went with another app called TripIt.  Much better. | This app seems abandoned. Last update was a year ago. Most contents in the app just wouldn‚Äôt load. Nearly unusable. | Planning a trip to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown Ky and the Creation Museum in Petersburg Ky.  Neither available. 

So not very helpful for us trying to plan a vacation. Will try again someday. | I used this app in Paris, great. However, when I tried to use it in Portland ME, I could not find Portland Head Light, one of the oldest lighthouses in America, commissioned in 1791 by George Washington. There is no way to add manually. We can only add what‚Äôs already there. Need to update please. | Very short overview.   Limited content. | If you‚Äôre into 70%+ of their posts being TikTok videos that they share, along with nondescript titles or descriptions, cool I guess. But that‚Äôs literally all it is, along with the thumbnails/ previews all being broken. 
Trash. | It won‚Äôt let me change ‚Äúsearching in xx‚Äù if I try to switch the card pulls up from bottom of screen then immediately goes back down. Unable to swap and use a big portion of the app‚Äôs functionality. | It has a really nice interface, easy information at a glance! It‚Äôs really helpful and I can see myself using it in the future. It doesn‚Äôt have Istanbul, which is my upcoming trip, though. Would be nice! Thanks, lots of potential! | It seemed easy at first. I want to have hotels, museums and restaurants in my itinerary. The app couldn‚Äôt locate one restaurant. Also, I set up an itinerary and the app lost all the information so I would have to start over. | Like the idea. Unfortunately it is Very buggy. I can‚Äôt search what I want. And the design is not very intuitive | Don‚Äôt bother, this app is designed to serve ads and collect personal info in exchange for doing basic google searches. | Great idea and app, has great potential if the searches were more up to date | Literally just an app for bookmarking travel spots.  Obvious features that would make it far more useful such as notes, personal ratings, and being able to jointly share itineraries are missing. | I cannot recommend this app. The last update wiped my itinerary! Now I‚Äôm hoping support fixes it before I need to rebuild it all. 

I feel dumb for not taking screenshots of each day. But I liked the flexibility of changing my plans in here. | No se c√≥mo manejar bien el app, para mi falta informaci√≥n de su manejo. | This app has no original content.   It just refers you to other articles and links filled with advertisements.   Stick with apple guides if you‚Äôre looking for crisp, well curated guides | Nothing original about this and they post terrible content all on Instagram. They just use other people‚Äôs work! | This app has a lot of good content, but the amount of notifications this app spams you with is absolutely insane. I heard a lot of good things about this app, so I just downloaded it the other day and I‚Äôve been immediately bombarded with 30+ notifications per day. I just looked to see if there was a way to personalize what kind/how many notifications you get and there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any options for it. It‚Äôs either you get spammed with notifications all day, or you don‚Äôt get any at all. Or you just deselect a bunch of things that you‚Äôre interested in, but that totally defeats the purpose of the app. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever left a negative review on here before, but I expected much better from such a highly regarded app. | best travel Apps EVER!!! | I couldn‚Äôt find anything, and it was much easier to just google locations. The app was much too complicated for my liking. | All this App does is refer you to TicToc or Instagram which I have no interest in adding to my phone. Very little original content. | Almost no useful info for places | Gracias | Kind of pointless. Miss Google Trips. | Too many error messages. Can‚Äôt even make a profile to start. App is updated. Just a lousy app | we can for our next one in Fall? | I love love love this app. I even use it when not traveling just to daydream and plan for the future. Love it! | Love it. Best place to get travel inspiration ideas. | Easy to use for travel plans and has lots of good information! | The perfect pocket guidebook for all of my travel needs! Helps feed my wanderlust, plan my upcoming trips and guides me while I‚Äôm in my destinations traveling! The content seems to be endless and always updating with the most recent things I should know about where I‚Äôm going! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è | Planning a trip to Iceland and it was so helpful.  All the great places to stay and so informative to plan just about everything.    Such a genius idea creating this app.     Thanks Trip Scout | Very helpful | Literally opened the app to use it for the first time and nearly panicked thinking I got my own dates wrong. Calendar isn‚Äôt synced, sept is really October‚Äôs calendar for example. Event locations not updated to show new location addresses‚Ä¶ not really impressed. 

I‚Äôll stick with my old school way of planning. | These are tons of experienced travelers. They don‚Äôt take you to the top rated five star restaurant everyone is talking about... they take you to the hole in the wall, home cooked meal that seats a total of 7 people. And the meal is better than you‚Äôve ever tasted. I have used this app from Cairo to Croatia to Iceland and it has saved me so much time on trying to find the interesting, desolate places! | Although Covid has put a damper on our travel this past year, we are ready to get back on the horse and continue seeing the wonders of the world.  We used TripScout exclusively to plan our last trip to Europe and it made our planning and executing seamless and informative.  Their network of travel experts, and travelers input makes it an extremely useful tool both for the novice traveler and nomads like my wife and I‚Ä¶.on the road again yada,yada,yada | Amazing app. Need an android version for my friends. | I love how tailored everything on Trip Scout is for my travel plans! I have all the best recommendations and tips for a great vacation right in this app! | By far the most diverse yet organized platform out there for anyone planning to travel, or who travels frequently!! A must have app! | Love this app. Easy to use. Great for trip planning and inspiration. | Huge fan of this app and loving the upgrades!  I recommend this app to all of my traveler friends - backpackers, luxury vacation, solo travelers, family travel, etc - because it is so easy to navigate and sort through based on your own specific travel profile and what fits you as you plan your trip.  When I‚Äôm not able to get away, I love reading articles on TripScout‚Äôs app and dreaming about future travel! | Incredibly easy to use and packed full of worthy trip planning information. Tripscout offers multiple perspectives on travel and helps plan my dining, lodging and short term excursions given the content is so up to date. It‚Äôs also an enjoyable escape where I can take a few minutes and feel inspired about my next trip. | It‚Äôs amazing so helpful and perfect ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è | Absolutely love using this app. Travel is much easier and far more interesting when using Tripscout to plan and execute trips. As added bonuses the Tripscout Instagram account has incredible photos and the new Facebook group is really helpful when considering travel | [Updated to reflect app updates] I‚Äôve been using TripScout now since the early years, and I can‚Äôt be happier. The updates are amazing, the new design is sleek and beautiful, and it makes me want to get back out there, whenever that will be possible ü§ûüèªü§ûüèª

It is my go to site when looking for travel and accommodations | Wonderful customer service | We have been through this for 15 years, ups and downs, screams, threats, resolve, and happy moments. I am still EXCLUSIVELY using this website because it‚Äôs like my family. I am very happy in the end. | So easy and so reasonably priced | We love using your services. Thank you so much. | Online faster | Don‚Äôt call Orbitz customer support number 855-828-3959 it‚Äôs some type of solicitation sales agency to people 50 & older (ridiculous). 
My Recent hotel booking I Reserved none smoking but orbitz got me smoking room and hotel charged extra fee for none smoking rm ??. First time ever to pay extra for smoking or none LOL.
It‚Äôs not how much I paid extra got me angry but how orbitz messed up my reservation & No way of resolving through orbitz !!!
After many years using orbitz, today is my last day‚Ä¶ goodbye orbitz | They show one price but by the time you are ready to buy, the price has increased dramatically.    A bait and switch? | I always come back to it.  Easy, and fast.  Also surprisingly gracious when I once made a hotel reservation that was a mistake, and it offered a refund. | Had better information before I downloaded the app!! | So far, so good | Very clean, great lobby | Very Easy to navigate | I can‚Äôt find my upcoming trips. LOL. | Works fast and well. | It‚Äôs a beautiful resort with great service. Its ‚Äúall-inclusive‚Äù designation wasn‚Äôt what one would expect, as you were limited to certain restaurants, were required to carry papers around for access, and had to report your room number about 100x a day. That was a bit off-putting to us. | I‚Äôve been using Orbitz for a many years long before an app existed. While the app is fantastic, their customer service is outstanding. | Was on the phone with them for a long period of time and kept being out on hold only for them to say they couldn‚Äôt honor my credit‚Äôs. 
Don‚Äôt use as they have bottom of the barrel policies, they do not accommodate you also language barrier with customer service as well | Avoid | The place is clearly rundown and in need of repairs. Door knobs are loose, walls are scuffed up, ceilings are painted with different color paints etc. More unbearable though was how poorly the rooms were cleaned. The bathroom was dirty with hair all over the bathtub and the toilet was also clearly not cleaned near the floor. Gross. | Esta aplicaci√≥n para mi es la m√°s segura y las mejores ofertas | I been using orbitz for long time ,, and i will  keep this .. trusted . ‚≠êÔ∏è | This B&B was exceptional and the Host (John) and his wife were pleasant to talk with. We enjoyed a much needed weekend escape and found this gem in Havre De Grace. We will be back! Comfy beds, cute room and plenty of outside patios with gas fire pits to take the chill off. Made to order breakfast to cap off the weekend stay. | Muy buena p√°gina para comprar ticket a todo el mundo . | I‚Äôve used this app for several years without any issues. I use it primarily to book airline flights, hotel rooms and rental cars. | I used Orbitz for a very long time and they‚Äôve been convenient until having an issue. I was overbilled on sight by a car rental company. After a few support calls an Orbitz agent assured funds would be returned to my card. Weeks later after no refund I was told to go to the car rental company. The run around and lack of support left a bad taste. | Needed to purchase airfare tonight for the SuperBowl so I downloaded the app and proceeded.
It took awhile to go through each phase step by step but was successful.  I‚Äôm liking the app most definitely. Wondering why I didn‚Äôt start using this app a heckuva lot sooner.
But Thank you for providing it!
Go 49ers! | the price shown will be double upon check out.
and theres a note from $1506 when up $3100  because price varies all the time.
fooling people! | Had a very efficient and pleasant representative.
Thank you so much. | Have not received any of my reward points in the last 6 months | Pretty easy to book, decent pricing. God help you if you have an itinerary charge or need a detailed receipt for something like a business expense, insurance coverage, or just want to look at the details of the cost breakdown. Have had a couple of trip delays cause overnight changes, and Orbitz people are the opposite of helpful,m. I had an agent try and rebook me on a different flight, and spent an hour telling them over and over again that they kept rebooking me on the same (massively delayed) trip I was already on, and then couldn‚Äôt cancel a hotel stay hours before the deadline to stay, or reschedule a rental car to a different airport because the airline rebooked my connecting flight to a different nearby airport. | Great app! Use it so much and save so much | About 3 weeks ahead of a trip I made a
Couple of car reservations. Then had to change and hopefully get the charges reversed. Had to call Orbitz and I was treated as a VALUED customer. A great customer relations person, handled everything just as I had hoped. | Been getting monthly emails about my orbit rewards but every time i go to the app to use them, the app is not letting me until they eventually expired.

App shows a message that they‚Äôve extended my rewards but with zero rewards!!! 

Stay away! Better do business with other platforms. | Try to cancel and put in itinerary number they provided and it doesn‚Äôt recognize it. | It takes me two minutes to buy a ticket 
It takes me 1 hour to cancel or change a booking
Recently I booked two cars in 5 minutes 
But to cancel 1 hour on the phone and 7 days  for the money back 
That‚Äôs not right 
Need to change that
I want to book and cancel online both things in 2 minutes !!! | Can‚Äôt stand the virtual help. She kept going in circles. And I still can‚Äôt get to a real person to help me | App not working | I could not correct a mistake on my email address under my profile. After googling to find their hidden customer service number I finally got through to a rep.  They could not correct my email address in my account. I used @gmail instead @aol)  So my only remaining choice is make the trip I booked  and then I can then I delete my account.  
That also deletes the credit I have but since I cannot correct the error it is worthless anyway. | Keeps crashing | More then 2000$ direct losses on booking and don‚Äôt have refunds.
5 hours waiting support and then, nobody fix problems! 
But also lost money ( around 36000$ ) because don‚Äôt be on time on events with clients. 

Nobody even send me email about all 3 stores with their app 

Newer download !!! | Not like the fancy hotels (Atlantis or the Baha Mar next door) but clean. Food is good and the buffet has a few new items each night that is good if you like that food. There are regular items if you don‚Äôt like the new ones. Also three specialty restaurants that are ok. I was expecting more out of them but the main entree in each specialty that I got was very good. There best feature is an excellent beach. About 250 yds of beach frontage equal to the best hotels on the island. If you don‚Äôt need fancy and can accept a dated property I would go. We were there for their New Years Eve party which was well done and fun | I recently took a trip and booked via orbitz. I got no rewards. | Easy to use.

Easy to peruse.

Easy to carouse. | I‚Äôve never had an issue booking flights, or renting cars from Orbitz. It‚Äôs always been simple and easy and straight forward. I booked a car to rent months prior in Cabo at their airport. I looked at the prices and it was 163.00 for the entire week and it did disclose you have to purchase mandatory car insurance. I did my due diligence and contacted Fox car rentals corporate office to find out how much the car insurance would be. The agent disclosed 16.99 per day. I was fine with that. 
Once we landed in Cabo and were conveniently shuttled to the car rental office we went inside and saw 3 agent podiums which two were in occupied while the third had two agents and an American citizen being swindled into some kind of transaction where they were pushing her to keep signing while we could hear her constantly ask them what she was signing. Big red flag. After 10 minutes the middle agent finally called us up and seemed annoyed that we were there. He pulled up my reservation and immediately started talking about insurance that it would be 1200.00 for the insurance since it was the holidays. I told them I talked to corporate and they disclosed the 16.99 per day mandatory insurance and that was it. They continued to argue and said it‚Äôs never that low and we must pay. The manager came over and backed up what he was saying. We were not going to pay that so we walked away. We realized there were several Americans standing outside that also walked away from their reservations because they didn‚Äôt want to get scammed either. It was annoying to try to get a ride and we tried to get an Uber but it‚Äôs illegal for Uber to operate at their airport.
We finally gave in and got into a taxi van and paid 90 bucks to get to our villa. We then uber around town and it costs us 5-6 bucks to get back to where we were staying. So it definitely worked out. But omg that experience at Fox car rental still has me feeling dirty and you should remove them from your site. Looking at all the reviews a lot of people are experiencing the same situation ! How about save your consumers the horrible experience and just don‚Äôt use them in Cabo! | Three months ago, it started crashing while I read reviews.

Today, it won‚Äôt even let me log in.

Had been happily using it for 20 years, almost every day over the last three. 

Is Expedia trying to lick us off the app? | Love being able to make great flights | I‚Äôve used Orbitz for decades now and it‚Äôs fantastic - especially if you are careful (they usually aren‚Äôt refundable so either get insurance or make sure it‚Äôs flights you won‚Äôt need to change). Great service! | Melia Caribe Beach Resort was incredible. The staff was amazing, including our personal concierge, Chay, who scheduled all of our dinners and made sure we were always taken care of. The resort grounds are gorgeous with peacocks walking everywhere. Loved the nature feel. The evening entertainment was lively with terrific music. A must stay! We‚Äôll be back. | App gives higher prices than the website. It crashes when searching and prevents from writing reviews.

But I did not find this app user friendly. Maybe it just didn‚Äôt suit my needs but I‚Äôm not impressed. | It has lists that auto populate based on the length of your stay, weather, etc but I really want to just attach my own things in addition, reservations, activities, restaurants. Maybe I just don‚Äôt understand this app. And it has nothing to explain it | Not $3, but $3 a month. Super annoying setup where you can just start making a list, you have to put in dates, destinations, and type of trip. I‚Äôm looking for a packing list app that lets me input my own lists. Keep it simple. | I‚Äôve been using this app for many years and I‚Äôve been very happy. I only use it once or twice a year and it was free before. I don‚Äôt mind paying to keep the app but now it‚Äôs wanting me to pay $20 a year. I would be happy to pay $20 just to have the app forever but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to pay that every year.I‚Äôm very disappointed because I really liked this app | This app told me to bring a scarf to Disneyland this weekend. It‚Äôs not going to be cold enough. You need to change your app and only tell people to bring a scarf when it‚Äôs below freezing. | Very basic packing list. It is good to include power adapters, health insurance card, but neglects things like an umbrella, hat and jacket and small scissors. Also ‚Ä¶for a long trip it suggested 15 shirts ‚Ä¶which is ridiculous. I take no more than 5 shirts even if going for months. Clothes can be washed. 
I don‚Äôt see any reason to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ok I suppose if you don‚Äôt already have a packing list of your own. There are many better packing lists for free on websites. | The way the ads appear and they way the interact (close ads overlap, etc), the app is unusable. | Used to be great. Now it‚Äôs just ads. How can an app about packing have so many ads? It‚Äôs insane. They also deleted all my old packing lists, so I can‚Äôt even reference those. Time to find another app. | I downloaded it and immediately opening the app my phone was overloaded with ads inside the app. Absolutely do not like this app at all | I recommend this app to everyone. I particularly hate packing because it‚Äôs so stressful, but the customized activity lists make packing a breeze. | Don‚Äôt like being forced to watch an ad to use the app | If dobt get premium sibscriptions doesnt seem like you can do much | Update: After using this for a weekend trip, this may not be the app for me. It is extremely frustrating that every time I open the app, it prompts me for an update. However, the App Store does not have an update.

But then all my lists keep getting put out of alphabetical order. This is annoying to find to check out and try to pack. Then items will be added to a person when creating a trip and it is not on the list that I have so where did it come from?

I will be looking for about her app.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I am searching for a good packing list. While this one is okay, it is frustrating. I have spent all day trying to load it up with our trips and it is just not user friendly. It is constantly putting my lists out of alphabetical order. So for me to sort it manually within each list and trip is just annoying. I also wish that I could easily remove a person from a trip and changing from multi-trip to single when duplicating a trip. | Updating my review because now there‚Äôs offline mode. Great app! | This app makes it so easy to put together a list for packing. As someone who struggles to stay organized, this app helps so much with providing suggested items per planned activity. SO much better than trying to make sure I think of everything on my own. I undoubtedly will either forget something or overpack planning it on my own. | This app is extremely helpful. It customizes your packing lists for the weather at your destination (and can update this). It also customizes it for your planned activities and duration of stay. It is a great way to make sure that you have what you need and don‚Äôt forget anything. it is by far the best list of this sort that I have encountered. The only small improvement I might suggest is for long trips on which you will be washing every few days, it would be helpful if you could specify the number of days between each washing so that the app knew what to recommend for packing. Nevertheless, it does a great job. | I‚Äôve never used another tool, but this one has everything I need ‚Äî pre-built lists, weather forecast and the ability to customize. Love it! | I have used Packr on iPhone and iPad for years. I did not realize there was a Mac app until recently so I downloaded it.

I have tried different packing list apps and packing list methods over the years including a spreadsheet, Notes, a Word document, and other packing list apps. I even tried Macsparky's Reminders packing list idea. I always come back to Packr. Why have I tried other apps if I like Packr? Because I like to try new apps! But I will not stray again. Packr just works for me. I ike that I can make different lists for different needs for different trips and reuse them over and over. 

Thank you for a great app! | I created my trip, selected the categories and when I submitted to continue, it gave me the option to either pay $3/mo or $20/yr for premium or watch an ad. I opted for the ad, because I hadn‚Äôt gotten far enough into the app to know if I like it. The full screen, 10-second ad counted down but then it was done, the ad wouldn‚Äôt close! The little ‚Äúx‚Äù was there in the top right corner but it didn‚Äôt work. I closed and relaunched the app twice, re-created the trip (because it wasn‚Äôt saved), and the same thing happened. I could have written out my entire packing list on paper in the time I wasted trying to make this app work. So disappointed. | This app is great, and it just keeps getting better. It works wonderful for multi city vacations or just quick getaways. One of my favorite features is saving customizable list. This allows me to have specialists for each of my trip needs, from camping in the mountains to water sports at the lake. Plus I can add my personalized photo to the top of the trip. | Used to be able to create a new default list with icons to choose.  Not saving new lists or adding an icon.  I thought you could add more than one trip photo. Can't find information on a huge venue tourist site in a city. | I like the concept of Packr but one major flaw. I want it to automatically sync between my iPad and my iPhone. All my other apps automatically sync (icloud) but it appears this has to be manually synced every time you make a change. Very inefficient. | I wanted to try out the app to see how it worked. No matter what activity I chose it pushed the buy-pro. I deleted the app. If you can‚Äôt give it a test run to see how you like it, I‚Äôll try another app | My devices have separate apps and don‚Äôt load the same trips. It would be nice if they would sync and have the same trips. Is there a profile? Not even seeing a way to log in. | Been a premium user for a while. Really wanted to love it because I travel for work a ton and need customized packing lists. This app has so many bugs and I am tired of items not showing up in lists I create, or reverting back to old lists after being updated. The idea is great but the execution is just not there. | Use basically every trip | Very basic app for the price | After creating your trip, you‚Äôre met with a full screen advertisement that can‚Äôt be closed even after the allotted time. The X button is unresponsive. | I purchased Packr Premium several years ago and absolutely love it. I had a problem when I deleted this app off of my iPad and thought I had lost all my lists, but the developer fixed it within a day. I use this app for all of my trips because I love the weather forecasts which help me know how to pack. I also have saved customized packing list for different activities like backpacking or international travel. I have recommended this app to several travel buddies who were green with envy when they saw all it could do. If you travel, it‚Äôs worth every penny. | I was packing for Coachella and this made my life so much easier because I was dealing with a health problem that made me very uncomfortable and not feel like myself. A month or so in advance, I was brainstorming things I wanted to pack and had come up with a preliminary list. Then as I was packing for the few days before leaving for the trip, I was adding as I went. Finally I finished everything on my list and I didn‚Äôt know what else to bring. I had to sleep and then leave in 6 hours lol. It was great!! I didn‚Äôt forget anything. 

I really like the layout of this app. Sometimes it can get confusing with lists and removing stuff in lists it asks you if you want it removed forever, i just ignore them and it seems to work out fine since i dont really need to pack for trips that frequently. It works well for when you want an app that‚Äôs not your Notes or Reminders app | This app is my CONSTANT GO TO to help me with my business and pleasure travels!
THANK YOU for being such an AWESOME APP!!!!!!!! | I‚Äôve several other packing list apps and have settled on Packr. It just does packing lists and does it really well. I highly recommend it. Also their tech support is awesome. | Can‚Äôt get passed the first add. The X is so far off the edge you can‚Äôt close the add. 
USELESS GARBAGE. | You can‚Äôt get to the packing list.  Watch an ad that allows you to advance but the button to advance to the list page doesn‚Äôt work.  Honestly, it‚Äôs an app that tells you how many pairs of socks you should bring on a 3 day trip, why the ads?  Delete immediately. | it crashes on my macbook. too bad. I had used in the past | I am a very heavy packer. Though I‚Äôm still this way, this app has helped me improve greatly. It‚Äôs very cool how it tells you the number of things to bring like socks, and shirts, gives you the ability to add things and tailors needs to the weather forecast‚Ä¶which it also has. It‚Äôs been 5-Starts since I bought it and has continued to be with updated and new features added | Do not download. Interface commonly crashes and though it is ad centric, the ads are coded in such a way as not to allow access through once viewed. Lists aren‚Äôt generated. | Do not have what I need | It might just be me. I love the app, but I‚Äôm not sure how I see the other family members I added. How do I see the list for my son? | This app thinks of everything. You tell it where you‚Äôre going and for how long and it gives you the most thoughtful packing list ever. It thinks of every single thing you may need for your trip! I highly recommend it!! | The new version makes you pay to even make a list anymore. The old didn‚Äôt. BAD. Try Packing List: Trip Planner instead. | Greatest app of all humanity for packing! | I can‚Äôt print my list.  The option is there, but it closes the app and doesn‚Äôt bring up a list. This doesn‚Äôt help me. If you want to carry your phone while you pack, this may be fine. | App crashed and I lost my $4.99 for the upgrade to premium. | I use this app for every trip I take!   Perfectly organized and easy to use!   The only reason I gave four stars is because the local  attractions are not so local!   A trip to the Bahamas brings me activities to do near Greece! | Premium in app purchase doesn‚Äôt share with family, I bought it and thought my wife could share it with 1 purchase. Not fair and the sharing feature isn‚Äôt explained well. | I love this app for packing lists. I have used TripIt for a couple years for keeping track of travel info. This works well with that to help me prep and pack for those trips. I‚Äôm he suggested lists consider weather and what I will be doing (after I make selections) to make the list very practical. I can also add my own notes and modify the list as I see fit. I also love the ability to share a list. I‚Äôm his has been helpful for my husband and me as we can just check that app and make updates (instead of assuming the other grabbed it or grabbing double.) 

The only addition that would have been helpful for this trip is a section for pets. I could be similar to the section for babies, but including things like food, leash, crate, meds, etc. would be super helpful for those of us who have pets but don‚Äôt always travel with them. | I want the travel butler back!!! | Every time I add a new item I have to close the app for it to appear on my list so I can add something else. Also, when I close the drop down and try to reopen, it doesn‚Äôt work. Just got this app and wish I didn‚Äôt pay for it. | Basically this is just an ad sever masquerading as a useful app.

Better off using a piece of paper or use notes.";4.61714;5976;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/5a/47/d3/5a47d3a3-b129-2949-ae98-0b5808b830e2/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/20/db/a2/20dba266-ba4a-1495-34ca-5835c161ac1f/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/1b/7c/78/1b7c78ab-a107-f5db-48ba-6f3b3ac46300/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/d6/02/46/d6024607-cb09-95bb-d0fa-4a215477bfbb/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/46/92/f3/4692f3bb-a142-449b-23b6-df29022df792/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/ab/64/4d/ab644d37-a1bb-93d6-b0d9-5256dc2fa9c2/f7009e51-8ea4-4437-848d-d61fa2542f93_EN_ipadPro129_1_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/71/4c/88/714c88ca-3f83-6194-0c3d-273436619c62/8cc8d6b5-ef74-48ef-95dc-c17f85df32b5_EN_ipadPro129_2_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/f5/ae/dd/f5aedd11-fe30-441c-79e9-7eb6395df7e9/8eba6cb9-4852-48ec-86f0-24b542ebb11d_EN_ipadPro129_3_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Ended up canceling my flight and have to pay $600 to get a new flight | When booking a flight it‚Äôs better to make sure ABSOLUTELY nothing will happen to prevent you from going. Not only do they charge the airline cancellation fee (normal and understandable) but they charge another $177 for their own cancellation fee which is absolutely ridiculous. I will advise everyone at all costs do not use this service. | I love using cheap o air | I added a checked luggage from Atlanta to Cleveland and from Cleveland to Atlanta. Instead of this they had it placed as a carry on and checked back to Cleveland. So to my surprise I had to pay $60.00 for a checked bag on my return trip. I will never use this service again! | Easy and convenient to use. Love the app and the website too | I love cheap o air | I will never use this app or company again. I will tell everyone what horrible service I have received | Very good app online | Very organized | It All Made Sense and it‚Äôs been great üëç | I use this app a lot unfortunately you can‚Äôt beat their prices. The real cost is if there is an error. They take no responsibility for errors on their part or the software malfunction. They will only care if you buy their over priced travel insurance policies. And those policies never seem to help if there is an error in your flight. 

I booked a flight for overseas. There was an error in their system so a last name was incorrect. When I called them, they said call the airline and they would fix it. The airline told me that Cheap O Air needed to change it. So I called them back and they said no and that if I just went to the airport the ticket agent could change it. So, I show up and they said no the vendor who sold the ticket needed to correct the last name. 

Very long story short, I missed my flight had to rebook and loose $1000 and change my flights causing delays and a worst flight intenirary that does not allow my wife and I and my infant son to sit together with some extra space. Our totally travel time is 24 hours with an infant. So our entire trip was changed and we have a terrible challanges to over come to keep us seated together so we can control our son so other passengers are not disturbed.

I have had similar issues with COA, but this was absolutely terrible. Besides the people who answer the phones have heavy Indian accents and they are difficult to understand in the middle of a crowded airport. 

Their prices are amazing and the customer service is terrible. As long as you have no issues with your booking, wrong spellings or incorrect last names, you will be fine. But if you need assistance to make your travel friendly, you will be met with a company that does not care if you make your travel plans as long as you buy more tickets from them. 

Good luck! It‚Äôs a gamble booking with Cheap O Air. But you might save money if you don‚Äôt have to rebook. | Cumple bien y en ella saco mis vuelos para ir a ver mi familia | I will introduce many customers to come here to experience .
Love guys | I was hours on hold to verify my payment information, so hard to get in touch with anyone they keep putting me with recordings my flight is the same day and I can‚Äôt get a confirmation so annoying and disappointing | Me gusta como puedo administrar mi cuenta | Excellent and accurate pricing | Tienen los mejores precios y el soporte es de buena calidad muy amable los de asistencia telef√≥nica | Great organization & Thankful for the service | It won‚Äôt show up a ticket to review before submit the order. It is no way can change anything after the purchase. | I don't recommend | I have used this service two times in the last year. My daughter booked my first flight, and me my second. And I have to say that they have had amazing customer service at every turn. Thank you Freid for your help and patience. Keep up the good work guys. Thank you for your help so I can see my other daughter and grandson for my 55th birthday! | Your app is not easy . | Removing the option to redeem points into gift cards is disappointing and a deal breaker | After I purchased ticket . A lot of fone call and he keep talking talking didn't care I understand or not . Then my credit card keep charge extra . Then I chatted with customers service . She said I purchased non refundable package. I have to cancel from my credit card . Crazy | Easy and exactly what I needed. | I was allowed to get tickets for international trip! Even though I was refused entry at the international airport‚Ä¶due to visa!
This company charges people their hard earned money! Then throws their hands up..in moments of need!
They will basically blame you for not doing the things‚Ä¶.you paid for! | Absolutely the worst website to book a flight.
So many charges so many fees and you cannot . if you have to cancel Second later if you make a mistake, they will charge you for that..
My rating for you guys would be 0. | Nice and affordable to go on trips with family or friendsüòéü§™ü§© | I started getting points , yeaaahh | First, they couldn‚Äôt change my flight from TPE to TAC. Also, when I was on the phone with the rep the prices kept increasing from MNL to TAC Philippines as we were speaking. Plus, I was charged extra for the for one check-in luggage one way. You got me good!!! However, you lost me as a customer for life. In the future I will book my own flights directly with the airlines. I don‚Äôt TRUST CheapOair. | Buenos precios. | I‚Äôm very happy with this app. I‚Äôm has been book with this app since sept 2022 for traveling to Vietnam. And from to USA . It‚Äôs very easy to use and searching for cheaper options. I‚Äôm recommended for all of my friends. Thanks CheapOair. | Me encanta son muy buenosüëçüèª | They sell tickets where they are not responsible for any problem, and they easily and simply only rely on the fact that they cannot refund your money. | I bought the tickets for my brother family, from Pakistan to Manchester that was Etihad airways tickets for the whole family, and connected flight through Paris, whenever I bout the tickets they never told be connected flights through Paris you need transit visa, although they are just connecting through France airport not going outside of the airport, they just sold me tickets, when my brother family were on airport , there they said you need transit visa for going through France, when I talk with cheap o air, they said we will not refund you any single penny, even I called before the 4 hours departure, and they are giving me again 2nd day flight with almost 6000$ extra and the same problem you need transit visa, how the dump agent, if he is giving me next flight with same airline how we can get transit visa with the same time, he just try to sell his tickets with extra 6000$ , more, beware when you buy tickets from cheap O air, there agents and app did not give you proper guidance, worst experience with this company , I will not do any more business with this company, | O love the prices | Just use their app to compare fares, but NEVER AND EVER BOOK AND/OR PURCHASE A TICKET WITH THEM!!!!
A word to wise is enough!!!!!! | It‚Äôs a user friendly app | This app made my traveling easier my my financial situation easier and it has truly served me well. | Great app i booked all my flights in here. Its the best, it gives you different airlines and prices | I am pinching myself getting round trip, nonstop, to Puerto Rico for under 300 bucks.  Wow!!!!  Telling everyone about this site.

Tom Von Fange | Great app. I was shopping around for a flight and saved the most through this app | Though the telephone customer service is great, this app is horrible. I book round-trip international flight for my family and I. I have been trying to get my trip to show up on this app for almost 2 months. I have called customer support two or three times on this issue they told me to uninstall and reinstall the app that would fix it. I‚Äôve done this three times. It still doesn‚Äôt work. | I have been using this service for over 15 years. I have bought every ticket I have ever purchased through them. I have never been disappointed or found lower prices then with them | Search for a flight from houston to phoenix, the price is $100 more compare to google flights or just booking directly with United, this app is not worth my time.

One star just because they‚Äôve failed to fix that one feature that is incredibly easy to fix. | After paying for the service and signing up, I couldn‚Äôt actually verify any of my physical documents in the app. This led to issues at the gate, and the personnel could not sufficiently assist in this regard. Very disappointing experience! | I am not sure why they have an app.. It does not tell you to update your profile‚Ä¶ You have to do that at the Airport and if you do not update your profile at that time.. you can not use the Clear service you paid for and ask to get out of the line and go to regular TSA.  So even if you paid for this service do not count on that you will be able to use it‚Ä¶ If you ask to call customer support you can not as the number they lost always says they are closed and the online Chat (Kayle) has no way to help you use something you paid for while you are at the airport | This used to be great but now it takes longer than regular security. The NextGen+ upgrade doesn‚Äôt work and their staff are incredibly rude. Save your money, and if you are in a hurry just get TSA pre-check. | Agent at LAX airport never explained or introduced himself. Just said he will help me get to the front of the line and took me to the Clear machine. Said he will get it for free then started asking to input info. By this point, too late for me to back out because I initially thought he would get me to the front of the line out of good grace. Ended up spending longer signing up than waiting at security itself. He should have explained everything before hand instead of using pressure in the scheme of ‚Äúhelping cut line‚Äù . Had to get the app and cancel membership because it isn‚Äôt free. | Lady at the airport said we can cancel after a week of trial . It was supposed to be a free week but we got charged $288 dollars . And now I had to cancel my credit card and get a new one . IF YOU Don‚Äôt TRAVEL A-LOT DO NOT GET THIS ! | This will trick you in enrolling for free and notoriously will lead you to think that once you cancel your membership, thats it! Wrong! They will auto renew your membership and charge you card! | Helped us greatly! Last week we were running late for our plane to LA. We would not have made it if we had to stand in that long security line! I asked about the TSA PRE CHECK, the agent helped us sign up and be on our way around the line, straight to the front! Definitely felt like VIP, I recommend to anyone that travels a lot! | This useless app just can‚Äôt verify my selfie for LinkedIn verification. | International airports still don‚Äôt work even after they said they were added (and should have been years ago). Try SYD and others. Nothing.

Updated: works now after comment from dev they were rolling it out. Advise don‚Äôt put it in release notes if it‚Äôs not available. | The vast majority of reviewers left a one star rating; how does that add up to 4.7?? | Clear lines longer than TSA Pre.  Check in process waste even more time. | Nowhere does it say in the same up you can‚Äôt use this if you‚Äôre not a US citizen. Instead they wait till you queue up in the airport, give them your fingerprints and then they tell. Resulting in having to queue again. 
Cancelling is also extremely difficult as they keep telling my password is wrong and it‚Äôs not. 
Worst service and app!! | Only works if you travel within the United States, I have a flight to ST. Croix United States Virgin Islands it should work but doesn‚Äôt. Time to delete this app. | The service is awful‚Ä¶.you need to wait eternity to get some response‚Ä¶it seams like they watching interesting movie while chatting with you‚Ä¶and they don‚Äôt care what problem you was faced‚Ä¶ enough of this nonsense from me. Deleting. | It used to be a ‚Äúskip the line‚Äù service but it‚Äôs not any more.  Every time I try to use it, it‚Äôs broken.  The agents tell me how it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsoftware update‚Äù and you have to reregister. Every single time I have used clear on the last 3 years, clear SLOWED me down at the airport. Awful awful awful.  Save your money and do not get clear. | Tried it about five times in the last 2 months and I think I think it would have been faster off going through the regular PreTSA at DCA. Also, they always seem to have technical issues. Will definitely not renew. | Why would I pay more to get screwed at the airport and have regular security passengers get checked in way before I did. This is a rip off - clear is essentially regular security at this point and is false advertising. I would give this app 0 stars if I could. Absolutely useless and a waste of time that will actually cost you more time than saving time. | After having problems with my ID scaling into the app, I contacted customer service via chat (as instructed). The wait time was negligible but when the chat started it took them 20 minutes to look at my account before I could even tell them my problem. I‚Äôve had the account for a week there‚Äôs not that much to review. I was instructed to cancel my membership and start again. I inquired about my 3 months of clear plus that I was supposed to receive free and was instructed to use the promo code again. I pointed out that it wouldn‚Äôt work because I had already used it. After 15 minutes I was told to cancel my membership, pay for it and then he would give me 3 months free. I am not paying for it before I  try it and determine it it‚Äôs worth the $200.  After waiting for 10 minutes for a response I simply clicked out thinking I would let the person at the airport assist me. When I open the app today, I was surprised to see my account canceled. I can‚Äôt reuse the promo code either. What a waste of my time and energy. | There‚Äôs no reconciliation system or viable customer support for data errors. They collect the data and that‚Äôs it! No service provided. Simply horrible. | It is very strange for my that this service doesn‚Äôt work with prepaid phone plans I cannot varify my identity on LinkedIn because I have mint mobile prepaid plan. Their support advice me to change my phone number or carrier. It is very strange. So each client with prepaid plan cannot use their service It is ridiculous | This app really doesn‚Äôt do much and doesn‚Äôt really even need to be used to get on a flight so why do they need to update it literally twice a week?  Once a month is even more than enough. Huge battery life drain downloading and installing this with auto update every few days. | I have attempted over 50 times to take a picture of my ID and passport and it keeps saying it won‚Äôt read. I have followed all of the instructions and it keeps saying it won‚Äôt read. | Poor customer service. App not fully functioning. | More than half of the airports I try to use Clear on don‚Äôt even have Clear so why are you selling it like every airport does this is kind of been a waste of my money. Where do I find the airports that actually use clear? | The experience was weird and complicated and difficult, I repeated the registration process again at the airport, I can't believe that a company and app made the experience of using technology so complicated, it was really awful, I canceled the membership, it was very expensive. | The app is good to contain all my travel ID information and to keep my membership information someplace.  The other features like flight tracking is extremely buggy and doesn‚Äôt work correctly.  When I tried to get support, either it was an AI just as buggy or an illiterate person.  Either way, I question if my information is safe or could it be compromised. | In the last year of 40 flights clear has failed to once be easier or faster than precheck, save your money | I landed in Detroit airport and the Clear line was longer (a lot longer) then the regular TSA Pre-Check line.  This has happened quite a bit lately, so just keep that in mind when go to the airport and in your justification for purchasing clear. | Like the title says, the app seems to work okay, but for no reason should anyone waste money on a Clear membership, as you end up paying more just to wait longer.  The concept is great, but Clear has failed to implement the process properly and provide any real value.  End result: DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON CLEAR. | Flying with Clear helps my trips to be easier and less stress!  Scanning my eyes or fingers are easy and reduces my wait time in in the Security Lines! Clear Team are always upbeat and personable as well as courteous!

Money well spent! | Can‚Äôt scan my id, image is out of focus. I‚Äôd imagine this is a problem with the macro lens and the app not supporting the camera api. Will revise review when it works. | App does not work, I can‚Äôt log in | I went to website to set up my account but the app won‚Äôt allow me to enter any of my information. | Subpar dev and qa efforts go to this app. They cant even get the basics right | Had a temporary license and tried to use my military ID for registration which they don‚Äôt take?! Wasted 30min before my flight just to get in the back of the line. I don‚Äôt understand why people pay for this service. | When you need a helpful app and they say I have one for you. This app is not it. Waste of time and money on development‚Ä¶ please start over,  from scratch‚Ä¶ | Continued to fail to identify me and support told me that you cannot verify your identity unless your name is on your phone company‚Ä¶ so a wife cannot verify her identity if her phone plan is under her husbands name‚Ä¶ | I was trying to use this to quickly go through the TSA line.  It took me the entire time of waiting in line for TSA for it to finally accept my passport, don‚Äôt waste your time. | All I get are error messages and there is no reason for it- all my docs are up to date and legit. I tried to reach out for help but was #30 in line. | Love being able to cut to the front. Also it‚Äôs hit or miss. After paying a premium for the clear+, going through Denver has left me wanting. Watching tsa recheck move faster than clear may have tipped the scales. Good app. Good idea. Starting to get behind imo.

Edit: scratch that. The gentleman trying to help me was incompetent. Then to top things off he tries holding my ID cause he wants to walk me through. Oh and passport isn‚Äôt good enough get verified?!? Canceled. Not worth it. | The age of getting value out of Clear has long passed. I fly out of DEN every few days, and you can always expect the Clear line being the *longest* line at the airport, every time. Thankfully with Precheck I can hop over and actually breeze through security, while the Clear line wraps around down the halls and around escalators. I‚Äôve been a member for 6 years or more, but it‚Äôs coming to and end now. Paying this company for the privilege of waiting LONGER at security is wild. They exist for one purpose and can‚Äôt meet that basic expectation. Great product that was severely tanked. Good riddance, Clear. | The Clear Rep told me, if you‚Äôre in a hurry use regular TSA Pre Check. Why am I paying $250 per year then? | This app is horrible!

I can not take a clear photo of my drivers license with the app‚Äôs built in camera setup. I have an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and have no issues using other apps to take a photo of my different forms of ID. 

The app‚Äôs built in camera setup keeps making the photos come out blurry. The phone is perfectly stable and it doesn‚Äôt matter if I get closer or farther away from my ID, the photos just come out blurry. My ID is on a solid black background with no light glare, great natural lighting and it still can‚Äôt take a non-blurry photo. 

There is no way to use my Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max macro mode for better photo enhancements like I can for any other photo I take using phone which makes no sense. 

Also, the app does not allow you to upload a photo of your ID that‚Äôs already on your phone. I have perfectly clear, close-up, front and back photos of all my ID cards and passport in my phone‚Äôs photo library. Why you have to take a photo and can not upload them makes no sense. 

This app description acts like it‚Äôs so high tech and professional but these are basic features for any app in 2023. I don‚Äôt understand how an app with these issues could have made it to release. This tells me the developers have not and do not test their apps prior to release. 

There are multiple other reviewers with the same issue but clearly nothing has been done. If the developers of this app read my entire review‚Ä¶ PLEASE correct these simples issues asap. | signing up for this will steal hundreds of dollars from you monthly, they wont let me cancel my subscription no matter how much i contact them, i‚Äôm considering to sue them | App is buggy, can‚Äôt take a picture of an id from iPhone 15 pro without being blurry. Atrocious support that close conversation because they won‚Äôt bother responding to me. Useless company ! | In-app camera produces blurry images with iPhone 15 Pro when trying to scan state ID, resulting in a rejected image and an inability to upload my ID. | Haven‚Äôt even used the Clear lanes yet and I am already frustrated of how bad the scan id screen is on the app. There is no way to get the id from not blurring it out. I have an iPhone 15 pro max and no issue with any other app using the camera. | Would be nice if the iPad version recognized the orientation of the device and changed to landscape mode when the device

Keep asking me the same question like it does identify me every time I try to check in. It only remembers my credit card number to make purchases. Very frustrating process. | Your intuition is amazing. How did you know when I clicked the button labeled ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù what I really wanted to do was go through another 8 screens of questions and acknowledgements.

As a user what I want is:

1. If I open the app and have a flight in the next 24 hours, show me the status automatically.
2. Give me a button that checks me in in 1/10 the clicks you currently do. One click would be ideal. Two clicks would be acceptable.
3. If I have bags in transit make the bag status available as soon as I open the app. | Very slow even when I am on WiFi.  I just want to get my boarding pass after checked in, it is very slow and lots of clicks and I can only get an email with links, which lead me back to the app, it is going in circles. | I‚Äôve had issues as a silver member assigning myself Econ plus seat at check in time. In the past it‚Äôs never been an issue but the last 5 times I‚Äôve flown I‚Äôve had to call in to get a seat assigned in Econ plus section. | Following a recent update, the ‚Äòadd to calendar‚Äô function when viewing details of a trip no longer works. | I cannot believe in this day and age that the united app still makes me manually enter my contact info (phone and email) every time I fly. Rather than cache it from last last time and ask if I would like to keep or change this info. 

Ridiculous | Been trying to get my boarding pass for five minutes and still don‚Äôt have. Would recommend a better experience. Less clicks to dive into my experience.

Some buttons dont work either. | United‚Äôs flight schedules to smaller destinations like Savannah align better with what is convenient for me. Staff and flight attendants are consistently friendly and helpful. | Newest update is smoother BUT adding boarding passes to Apple Wallet is WAY TO PAINFUL. 

Don‚Äôt burry the feature put it back up front as it has been since launch. | I keep changing my credit card and adding my TSA pre-check number, but they never save it and every time I travel on United I have to re-enter the numbers | When I check in with the app, it doesn‚Äôt auto fill my upcoming flight. Obviously, they should have that information so it should auto fill rather than having me dig back an emails to look for that. | Cannot k in | Nothing loads in this app, clicking anything makes you get this death spiral ‚Äúplease wait..‚Äù | This app is the worst.  45 minutes of attempting to check in. Had I booked this flight I would have chosen American Airlines.  Their app is easy.  United‚Äôs app is just awful. | United App is a very cumbersome app. Takes a long time to do a simple job like making reservation, online checkin, bag check and so on.

I suggest you have your tech staff see Delta airlines App and improve your app.
Thanks | I can‚Äôt believe united airlines is not able to make a good app. Southwest Airlines app is the best. | It says you get a $5 discount to prepay for checked bags if paid 24 hours or more before the trip.  i spent at least an hour truing to find where to do that bit never did find it.  It seems I could only do that once I could check on, which was 24 hours before the flight.  I never could get the discount.  I had to call and talk to an agent.  Its ridiculous. | Cannot add trip yi my calendar, difficult to access viewing changing seats, and check in box is barely visible | Latest update CRASHES app while trying to open it | Worst flight delayed and then cancelled | Information is enter , but not saved. | I keep on losing my recent searches, and that didn‚Äôt happen before. Please help! | As a longtime Delta flier, I was pleasantly surprised to see there are ways to make an airline app nicer and easier to use. Bravo, United. | hire some youngsters and make your app easy
it‚Äôs too analytical
make it like SWA app simple fun like ppl think | How come I can‚Äôt erase my non-existent home phone? I only have one phone now and it‚Äôs my mobile phone. | If I wanted to travel spirit airlines I would have gotten a much cheaper flight and then all these add on fees and restrictions. Telling me that I can‚Äôt check in online if I don‚Äôt check a bag is ridiculous. Not giving me a seat assignment when I check in is absurd. I never plan on flying United again. | Compared to other major airlines, the United app is trash. Unintuitive interface, poor usability and limited capabilities are the trifecta of terrible. | I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I saved my passport and my families passport to this website and I spend about a half hour resubmitting them every time we travel abroad | The widget design is no working properly. Black background. | In this day and age it‚Äôs unbelievable that my seats were changed so that I‚Äôm not seated with my son and I can‚Äôt change the seats. Same on Delta overseas last year. | DO NOT BUY TICKETS ON APP.
I just looked online and my tickets were over 50$ cheaper on the computer than on the app signed it. Such a joke and a scam! | Would be nice if the app made it possible to add a carry on bag.  Spent so much time trying to find a way to do that‚Ä¶ | I would like to thank Mariana and the gentleman that helped me in checking in for their upmost  personal care of my entry status. 
Love flying with United and wish for your flight destination sfo to tlv to be re activated. | Even though I am a premier member, I keep being asked to pay for my luggage on app. | Always, it is too difficult to ever find my boarding pass online. I have to go to the counter and actually get a paper pass with other airlines. I am lead on my phone to where I can get the boarding pass to come up. | This is errant and/or against the United policy. | Simple to use, very clear and, most important, effective. | No online check in => app is useless | When using the United App, the app randomly closes.  Has occurred When checking in, making reservations, during entertainment‚Ä¶. | I flew United on my journey to and from Maui for my world famous light worker healing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π retreat and I had the best experience I‚Äôve ever had!! Thank you üôè United looking üëÄ forward to more flights! Hopefully first class very very  üîú | United is the absolute worst airline I have ever flown. I have had to stay overnight in the airport with no accommodations whatsoever due to fault of United screwing up and delaying there flight missing my connection. This is the worst airline I will make sure to never fly United ever again | This airline has been incredible shout out to 
Mr Arnold | I‚Äôm not lying when I tell you this is the worst app experience I have had in my life.  It was terrible and by a factor of 10 worse than anything I have ever endured.  I am at a complete loss of words beyond what I have said to tell you how bad this was.  Horrible. | Pretty happy with the app, but the upcoming flight widget is showing as top battery consumption on my phone since the last update. 77% vs 5% next highest app | It should only take, at most, a few clicks to share my trip itinerary. The process to do so, currently, is convoluted and in the end it didn‚Äôt even work. I received an error message that the phone number is incorrect. It‚Äôs not. Your app is incorrect. | I used the app to check-in and when I checked a bag I was charged $40.  As a card holder I thought I got the first bag checked for free?  I could find no information on your site anywhere to correct this, very frustrating. | That‚Äôs it. The app does not function. The end. | My | Site was user-friendly, and quick to navigate. | I recently had a very bad experiencing using the United app to check in for a paid trip.  The first problem is that the app would not let me check in for a booked trip event 24 hours prior though the app indicated I was checked in the evening prior to my flight. When I arrived at the airport to board my flight, I hand to recheck all over again.  The second problem is that it would not accept my credit card and billing address change for when I tried to check a bag.  The third item was that it would not process my TSA PreCheck even though I used it for a previous flight a year prior and there was no change in my PreCheck number on my profile. The fourth and final issue is that when I tried to use the chat feature, the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù tech informed me that I could not resolve the credit card billing and address issue until I arrive at the the airport to work with a live agent.  The United app is totally useless to use.";4.76954;6045518;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d0/f3/70/d0f370ca-3dfd-14d7-864b-e69c2cebf353/eea244cc-f95c-4efa-850b-62574c5d59db_1242x2208bb-6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/23/92/1a/23921a49-59c1-f843-b260-78dad5eb0698/c04d52fa-9b3b-42a1-add7-2df45dd68755_1242x2208bb-7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6d/9a/9c/6d9a9cd6-fb04-25d5-1fbe-a51d4080fc2a/77bb9ef3-ce16-49d4-93cf-a1f177002801_1242x2208bb-8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/cb/59/9f/cb599f11-4dd9-dc96-7097-f0ed6add1bfc/a10d52aa-1108-4cf5-8a8b-270d1fb1fd9f_1242x2208bb-9.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/78/b8/24/78b82444-4199-30ca-64af-bbc430265add/1541d19f-3789-4d88-8746-cd53be638471_1242x2208bb-10.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/76/0d/2e/760d2ed6-9b69-bba7-7584-ffc0a9a5bd9a/c8dc81f1-7abf-4754-a09c-886c0288e43e_2048x2732bb-12.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/97/e6/78/97e67872-a7bb-9452-6e97-adfb7f9b014d/c39444b4-08eb-4d70-adf0-180174ae85de_2048x2732bb-13.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6a/c0/f5/6ac0f58d-237c-f8cc-919d-75e73a2d9001/5437548a-4f37-4bf1-9df5-e635a9c319fe_2048x2732bb-14.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/82/0c/8d/820c8d85-3cfe-03ca-5c04-2806b89b909d/3763fde0-d874-4425-9478-27cf2849d3c4_2048x2732bb-15.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d3/33/c9/d333c918-bedd-075a-877b-9051f7e51b9b/57300edc-011a-49c4-b8b4-49bab923e73a_2048x2732bb-16.png/576x768bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I tried contacting ahead of my scheduled tour and received no response.  Once tour started and I contacted customer care they were no help and told me one thing while the actual vendor told me something different.  Then when I confronted the vendor the man called me a liar and stated that customer care did not say what I was informing them and do to it being through chat and conversation was over I could not prove my side and was denied my tour which I paid $182.00 for. | The app is well designed and easy to use.  I‚Äôve booked two tours in Spain and they both turned out very well.   I would use the app again in the future. | Photographer was 2 hours late, wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to shoot. Then he says 2-3 days to get photos back but it took a week. Wasn‚Äôt  professional at all. But photos did turn out nice ‚Ä¶. | See above | Obviously waist of time and money 
Flooded with advertising online and misleading customers! | The trip was really good, wish we had more time to shop and explore a little more but understand that it‚Äôs already a long tour considering how much time we are on the Bus.. Khan the guide was very helpful and knowledgeable made the trip way better..Remember to sit on the right side of the bus Passenger side! For the best views.. | We took a trip to SE Asia with many side trips. We booked those trips with Get Your Guide. We found that the providers of their services were were great. They communicated before the trip and were reliable. The trips were just as advertised and the guides were great. Our friends on the trip booked with another popular site and were very disappointed with the communication and reliability. We will definitely book through Get Your Guide. | I made a mistake when booking which was very easy to cancel and rebooked | I tried for too long. Deleted and reloaded the app. I cannot save any favorites using this app, so I have to start all over looking every time I use it. Upsetting. | Lousy experience 
If you want to speak to someone to cancel 
Well forget that this is a shifty operation | Typed in Bermuda got day trips in Barbados | I bought a Vatican tour with this app. The service provider postponed it last minute. When I showed up for the appointment they said o should come back in 2 hours. Went back 2 hours later , they said there was a miscommunication with Get My guide. I didn‚Äôt receive the service, nor I received any refund as both parties blame each other. My day was ruined as I spent many hours at the meeting point waiting for them to sort this out. I can‚Äôt believe this app has 4.9 stars average when all the recent reviews are 1 or 2 stars. Stay away! | Guillermo, Ruben, Lisa made our ATV experience the best it could be. From pick-up to drop-off was seamless.  Safari outfits you with windproof clothes and gloves, and a helmet. The experience was the only way to experience Iceland. | Easy, convenient and right at my finger tips to pick what event I want to participate in. | I would not use this company ever again. I had an issue with my tour that costedÔøº me Ôøº hundreds of dollars and when trying to resolve with the company, it‚Äôs been more than a month of them telling me to wait while they‚Äôre processing my request and when I call nobody can help me. Ridiculous. Ôøº not to mention their initial response was to offer me a $40 refund when it costed me over $800. The tours themselves were great but I would just go directly through the tour Ôøºcompany they contract with versus having GetYourGuide be the middleman if they‚Äôre not going to appropriately handle problems. | I can‚Äôt image a better way to spend in Scotland. Stephen was our guide and he was spectacular! Our daughter is 11 and she thought he was so funny and he has the best history stories. You must book this trip. You won‚Äôt regret it. | So exciting to look forward to new experiences I haven‚Äôt try myself and at a reasonable price!! Thank you, thank you! | This provider just gets you to buy tickets through them at the same price as at the venue but then forces you to download their app to download it. It‚Äôs pretty terrible all around. I lost my place in line as I had to find WiFi to download the app and then get a QR code. I could have just got my tickets at the venue without hassle. This is just another provider trying to get marketing info. | Sometimes the app is glitchy, but mostly works well, and always the staff is there to help. Considering they are a worldwide company it‚Äôs quite remarkable how well things go. I found it very helpful and locating and registering for specific tours. | They don‚Äôt require descriptions that help you if you have a problem such as if you‚Äôre late how you can catch up with the tour. My first time booking & I will not be back. | I was hesitant with downloading once again another app, but the experience with the GetYourGuide app has proved very useful and easy to use with all of the ticket vouchers and details included in each of the bookings. Highly recommend!! | I have used this app in Ireland and Japan as a US traveler and it has been very easy and reliable to use. All the information is available in the app once booked and the vendors reach out personally to your email as well with details.  I will continue to use this platform for future travel. | Very informative and user friendly.  Easiest way to plan excursions | Highly useful and I like that it allowed me to transfer plans to app | The titles and descriptions are deceiving. 
We bought tickets that were titled ‚Äúdesert safari/camel caravan/sand boarding/atv and desert bbq‚Äù this was at a place called 
Al Faqqa
 It was a complete joke!! It was filthy to start. Second they said the ATV was extra and not included. Third the camel caravan was only sitting on a camel and walking to a photo opt. 
The dune bashing was only through the sand to the camp and the sand surfing was not worth it. Instead of a half hour for each activity they expected you to just walk around the desert or buy things from them. This is not what we came for! 
This was our last excursion and the one we were looking the most forward to in the UAE and it totally ruined it for us. What began as a trip of beauty and high respect for the people ended with us realizing there are scammers everywhere - do not fall for this one!!! 
Al Faqqa is terrible and should be shut down. 
Get Your Guide should be ashamed of themselves for the description and stop all tours to this place. | Unable to update email or country and currency.  Making to have create a new profile every time there is a need.
Change emails with assistance if decide to keep present profile
You should be able to update!! | Remove Old Wish List - site needs improvement, updating required to be user friendly. | New to Get your Guide and I am having fun booking tours for my upcoming trip to Europe! Thanks for this easy to use and understand app! | This was one of the best tour I have ever been on!! Made my whole day happy . Highly recommend. | Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable, informative and helpful. She was able very patient and passionate about the history of Lisboa. If the opportunity arose to visit Lisboa again. I would definitely seek her for another tour. | A fantastic and unforgettable trip! Highly recommend Konrad, his professionalism, enthusiasm and detail oriented, along with the royal treatment to us has made our tour very enjoyable and unforgettable, thank you so much Konrad! | I payed got the codes but couldn‚Äôt get the voucher | Booked with ease-what a great app. Thank you developers üòä | Very unfriendly. Needs to be easier to use. I am tired of having to enter my email address multiple times. The software constantly takes me to places I did not ask for. All I wanted to do was print my ticket, but this is beyond the capability of the software. | Excellent experience,  I would do it all over again. Our guide Nadine is amazing. | All the sites were very good. I learned a few things I didn‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm glad my wife and I visited Panama. I hope to return. | Very organized and easy to book.  All in one place.  Great app! | Fraud.  Don‚Äôt spend money | Super bien el gu√≠a y el transporte seguro solo que fue un d√≠a muy caluroso, restaurante y lugares super bien explicados ,nos encant√≥ !! | Five Star Tour!! Dipendra was the absolute best guide!! He was a wealth of knowledge and made our tour exceed expectations!! The process was seamless and we will definitely use this company again as well as recommend to all of our family & friends...
Also,  we recommend requesting Dipendra as your guide on future tours and excursions in and around Kathmandu Nepal. | very helpful | II don‚Äôt recommend them to anyone and will give them a horrible review. They kept $130 of my money and is unacceptable. They are crooks. | The tour I paid for was very hard to find the starting point in Dubai. It should have marked better. I have a challenging disability which made it more difficult and I got lost. I asked Get Your Guide to refund my money. They wouldn‚Äôt do it. Please keep this information in mind before you book with them. | The app is easy to use and provides a good description of the activities. If your cruising most provide pickup and drop off at the terminal. Nice people to work with. | I tried searching food options in Banff Canada and the app doesn‚Äôt let you look anywhere except for their top 4 destinations. | These are 2 absolutely must-see sites in Florence! Having a guided tour was extremely helpful in truly appreciating the magnificence of this art!  Our tour guide, Anna, was knowledgeable and fun and helped provide great historical context as we viewed such significant pieces of art! | Holy miss advertising 

Be very very careful and read the small print.  This is my 3rd time using.  2/3 where disappointing and misleading.  Love to hate this company. | Couldn't have done Paris without this app! We booked 5 tours with Get Your Guide. Not only were the tours amazing, the tour guides were fantastic. All so knowledgeable and helpful. GYG made our trip so much easier. I would highly recommend using them. | We used to us Trip Advisor and Viator exclusively but after finding excursions to be slightly cheaper, this is our goto app.";4.87657;81933;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3a/d5/6e/3ad56e74-2b4f-782a-63e7-2d1e36291833/21f9d27b-ff88-4e23-878b-f5eb418ba074_01_iOS_5.5_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/c4/84/e7/c484e74d-dd1f-39d8-d88a-e7237161072c/c945da87-eb78-42f1-acf1-e17b7ef655f6_02a_iOS_5.5_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/e4/f0/e2/e4f0e21d-55c1-8268-71f0-71afccfcfe1b/e01f5b71-a029-4932-825c-1eaf91b0968e_03_iOS_5.5_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9f/d7/46/9fd74639-7fa3-463a-ed85-a896e39e2ea3/5c5edc2f-a008-485d-b1de-6c504ae5fcf3_04_iOS_5.5_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/cd/2c/41/cd2c41f6-ec53-6838-f9aa-2874ea927f3a/12933506-182f-44e6-bf79-1875937bca52_05_iOS_5.5_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/df/3f/34/df3f34ba-3279-f60f-5344-f048dd98ac7f/6bf0ca53-8b7d-4344-b228-bcdec1f69e5a_06_iOS_5.5_EN.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Hire me to fix your app i am begging you | Love this site!! I use it everywhere I travel and enjoy seeing and experiencing more things than the average tourist. I am always amazed at the awesome Sites and little known destinations that they have compiled. I even used it near my house in upstate New York and despite living in the area for 44 years, still found cool places I‚Äôd never heard of or been to. I tell everyone that is going anywhere to use Atlas Obscura | Atlas Obscura is not just an app; it‚Äôs a magic carpet ride to the most extraordinary corners of our planet. Its user-generated content brings to light the less trodden paths and uncovers sights and landmarks that traditional guides often overlook. This app is the epitome of adventure and discovery, perfect for those yearning to explore beyond the ordinary.

The interface of Atlas Obscura is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through its vast network of wonders. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned traveler or a curious explorer in your backyard, the app tailors its discoveries to suit your location and interests. It‚Äôs like having a knowledgeable friend in your pocket, always ready to show you something fascinating.

One of the most striking features of Atlas Obscura is the diversity of its content. From awe-inspiring natural formations to quirky roadside attractions, the app covers an eclectic mix of places that are both informative and entertaining. Each location is accompanied by detailed descriptions, user reviews, and often, mesmerizing photographs that stir the wanderlust in you.

Moreover, the app fosters a sense of community among users. You can contribute by adding new locations, sharing your experiences, or offering tips, which makes Atlas Obscura a living, evolving atlas of the world‚Äôs wonders. This communal aspect adds depth to the app, making it more than just a guide‚Äîit‚Äôs a platform for sharing and discovery.

However, it‚Äôs important to note that while Atlas Obscura opens the door to hidden gems, some locations might require careful planning to visit. The app does a great job in providing essential information, but it‚Äôs always wise to do additional research, especially for remote or less accessible places.

In conclusion, Atlas Obscura is a treasure trove for adventurers and curious souls. It‚Äôs an invitation to step off the beaten path and plunge into a world of fascinating discoveries. For anyone looking to spice up their travels with unique, offbeat destinations, this app is a must-have. It‚Äôs not just about places; it‚Äôs about experiencing the myriad stories and wonders that our world has to offer. | I absolutely swear by using this app when I travel to find amazing sightseeing and experiences and real world ""Easter eggs""... but it isn't without its frustrastions:

- Currently, newly marked places I've visited no longer give me a grey flag. This makes it confusing to see where I should go next. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling even, to no avail.
- After awhile with the app in use, you'll get an error message ""something went wrong"" and can't mark anything, and you'll need to restart the app and refind the location to mark. I've had this problem since I started using this a whole year ago and it is still not resolved!!

Also, as a suggestion, I like that places that are permanently closed are still featured, but could be helpful to give them a distinguished color marker, like red or something (but still allow gray flag for those who visited before shutdown). 

Also, when clicking ""Directions"", it uses my Google Maps, but would be nice if it have me the option to use Apple Maps instead (like Happy Cow app lets me do). 

I want to give it 5 stars, but these bugs sometimes break my flow while I'm exploring. | Good content for atlas obscura but really the app needs some work. Jerky, hangs, not usable at times. | Never fails to enlighten and inform with fascinating articles. | I‚Äôve only been working with the app for a couple of hours but I‚Äôm finding it very difficult to navigate.  It‚Äôs not intuitive, its slow and clunky. I‚Äôm finding basic tasks,  like adding the countries I‚Äôve been to,  really hard to complete.  Maybe it‚Äôs me, and I just need more time with it but I still feel like it shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to work with. | I love Atlas Obscura, and this app is overall wonderful but I sure wish links would open in the app rather than my browser | Only got this yesterday - it‚Äôs great. Helps with vacation planning in a big way. | I love the website and the content, but the app is janky. One major issue is it hangs when trying to filter results. | This app works well and the information is great! I have so many places I want to see and so many I‚Äôve seen and I can put both in separate lists. | Awesome app for the travel who likes off the beaten path. Only downside is the actual map, hard to use on a iPhone. | I travel a lot for work and my photography hobby, and I *love* going to the places I see on this app. Doing so helps me learn about the history, architecture, ecosystems, and sometimes reveals photo opportunities I wouldn‚Äôt have found on my own. It also keeps growing as people add sites so if I go to the same city multiple times there are sometimes new suggestions to check out. I love it! | My family and I love this app. They were many times that we went on vacation and ran out of things to do so we open the app and search for surroundings. | I love atlas Obscura, but the app is glitchy. When you are trying to view places, it won‚Äôt let you click the lists and clicking a hashtag doesn‚Äôt work very well either. | Earth‚Äôs most exciting travel app. You‚Äôre shortcut to what is interesting and off the beaten path. | We just had a wonderful lunch there. The wait went by quickly the food was delicious. Best of all our server, Claudia was delightful. Highly recommend First Watch. | Great app, fun when you travel to a new place! 
Cleveland Rocks! | One of the top 10 apps on the App Store. The store would not be complete without it. | A must-have for any avid traveller. Full of surprising finds and always interesting to explore! üåè üåé üåç | My scoring of 0 was completely wrong. 
5 Baby! | Love road trips and unusual attractions. This is a perfect road trip companion! | Hard to figure out and save routes and attractions | After starting a list, the newly created one doesn‚Äôt appear in selection to add other locations. Also no way to delete lists. | Any time I go anywhere, I check with Atlas Obscura to see what else I could see there | Would like to see an iPad version of the app.  The content is great and a more advanced search would be fantastic! | I‚Äôve used this app and their website to find the lesser known attractions. I love the history and stories. You will too! I tell all my friends and family about this whenever they say they are traveling . | Glad this is finally in app form, but sad the add location feature is broken since I know some wonderful nooks and crannies | The app is really hard to navigate and is missing features from the website. It‚Äôs a completely different experience, so if you like the site you probably won‚Äôt like the app and vice versa | I love the obscurity | I would love to hear a podcast or read about the Tarahumara abilities to run and how they live | Trying to add places I‚Äôve been to the map, not working. | The world has nothing but bad news, or so it seems.  This is a reason to turn on the iPad. | Right out of the gate it‚Äôs my first time using the app and it will not simply load when I try to pick an interest to search ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Closed the app and tried again and it still just sits on the loading categories screen and never loads anything. WTH? | AO is an amazing resource | This app is my favorite now! I love seeing new interesting places to check out of just admirer. Make a Bucket list! Lol very well made and beautiful pictures to boot! | Traveling in London and Paris, and this app has amazing info for finding the most interesting and unusual sites. But if you want to use the app features (been there, want to go, new place, etc) it often doesn‚Äôt work. It just says to try again, and again and again. | Look I love atlas obscura and I use this app literally all the time. It has serious bugs- when you press the options to note if you‚Äôve been to a place or would like to go to it, the app freezes for a time until it‚Äôs ok to use again. Very slow. Also, the loading takes a really long time with the ad at the start, like 1-2 minutes. It crashes often, or forgets my login info and I have to restart the app. In general, it‚Äôs not very good. I turn to using just the regular atlas obscura page in my browser often when out and about to compensate, but I want to use this app with amazing potential! It just needs a thorough debugging and someone with good coding skills to go through, put some money on this atlas obscura, it could be so so great.

But if type it it does translate it correctly | This app is very helpful and overall a gift. However, there are many text-to-speak options missing for formerly colonised African languages. 

For example they have Igbo, one of many languages spoken in Nigeria, but they do not have text-to-speak options. 

Naturally someone will say that since there are so many languages, Google cannot get the text-to-speech feature for all of them. 

They will also say they hope to get around to it like they have for other African languages, but sadly the countries which once tried to erase the existence of these languages have long since been fully featured on the app.

There seems to be a prioritising of languages which allows some to be fully featured, while others waste away in waiting with hopes of being recognised by the world, though many taste the use of them on their tongues. 

I hope to one day have text-to-speech for Igbo and many other African languages, but I am tempted to think it would be unwise to wait with bated breath. That being said, I still appreciate this remarkable resource. | So I can no longer use Google Translate with my iPhone 7 because of this change.

When I search and mess us and search agin they jack the price. Won‚Äôt use them ever again | The app 1st takes me to a place to book a new flight which makes me panic you lost my booking. Please 1st take me to my current flight based on my phone number. | Thanks | Had to do everything twice and now with the portals you sent I cantfind my trip information or seat confirmation very very frustrating | Son lo mejor | Everything was excellent. The food was awesome and the servers and wait staff were all wonderful  especially the older host in the restaurant inside the hotel they made me feel so special for my birthday. | Muy buenos presios | Like title says enjoy !! ‚ô•Ô∏è | Too many changes, I like the old app better. Harder to use now. | I used your web site for renting a car and when I went to pick it up at ACE the price had tripled‚Ä¶.what a deal .
Thanks but no thanks. I will never use your site again. I wanted to give a zero star but that choice is not available. | AI | I needed to purchase a round trip ticket for my friend coming NASCAR weekend at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Oct 13-16,2023.
Quickly, I was able to find a round trip, with carry on & insurance for $286. We think it was a good deal. It was easy to navigate there website. | I tried to book tickets on this app and was charged over $400 with no tickets confirmed. I got an email stating I was charged $0.00 for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FLIGHT than what I was trying to book for. Like the airline was wrong, the to and from state was wrong, this is INSANE. And now I can‚Äôt get ahold of anyone with their customer service. What a terrible app!! Please do not use this app. | Prices are great! | Stuck in New Jersey for 3days..,due to flight cancellations of flights.. need some reimbursement | Rally easy to use | Not good spp | I love using CheapTickets their site is easy to navigate user-friendly. As well as their customer service when calling is very professional, and very courteous. | my experience has been very good thus far .  how ever √¨ would prefer to wait until the end of the flight to make a specific assessment of th√© service and airline, I am ·∫£ Disabled passenger and even though I heard Spirit airlines is difficult i have reason for accommodations.  So, please relay a message on my behalf. | Very difficult to print details of flights, assign seats, etc. | great quick service | Very easy to maneuver through the website very clear with explanations and detailed information. Thanks | The cheapest and fastest | Prices are ridiculous and flight availability are too. CT advertise Best rates but not so. Find a flight half the price and don‚Äôt ever want layovers for 13 hours, completely ridiculous. | We would stay here again.  Staff was very welcoming and friendly even though they were multitasking and busy.  Room was clean; bedding and towels were clean and although that may be a ‚Äúduh‚Äù statement, we have stayed at another brand hotel where the drapes and blankets and bed spreads were full of cigarette burn holes and the towels had hair in them.  Furniture was dusty.  I wanted to sleep standing up!  We don‚Äôt need fancy but certainly need clean and this motel 8 provided that.  Location was great.  Bravo motel 8 in Florida city. | I had booked a car and when I got there it wasn‚Äôt what I booked. They gave me an EV. I would never book that vehicle since it‚Äôs time consuming and I‚Äôm on vacation. I also waited over an hour for it. 
There was a flood in Fort Lauderdale the day before and people were rerouted to fort Myers and I saw a bunch come in to get cars to drive there, which makes me think they have my original vehicle away. Very unacceptable and I will not be using your app again. I‚Äôm very disappointed with the service. | Excellent app. | I LOVE CheapTickets because you can Book Hotels, Vacation Rentals, Cruises, and Flights at a low Fare! | International search couldn‚Äôt be done and  completed. I was searching for Mali, Bamako. 
Could not find it anywhere. | MOST OF THE STUFF ON THIS APP YOU CAN BOOK YOURSELF. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS RUDE AND NASTY. THEY WILL LEAVE YOU STRANDED. AND THE CHEAP CASH IS A GIMMICK TO ATRACT YOU. IVE USED THE APP A FEW TIMES AND WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY CHEAP CASH‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

YOU SAVE MORE MONEY BOOKING YOURSELF. CHEAP TICKETS DOESNT HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY AFTER THEY BOOK YOU. THEY GET THEIR CUT OF THE PROFIT AND RELINQUISHED ALL RESPONSIBILITY‚Ä¶.. | Me encanta porque tengo mas app y esta es donde mas baratos tienen los tickets | This is my go-to hotel reservation app. The prices are generally lower than other apps AND often better than the hotel‚Äôs own site. I‚Äôve never once had a problem.
However, more recently, the coupons aren‚Äôt the best and the deals are not as good as they once were. But still have never had an issue at the hotels themselves. | Hate it | I‚Äôve been traveling all over the United States with cheap tickets.  I haven‚Äôt found prices any cheaper than on this app.  I also want to make it clear how easy it is on the app and at the airport and hotels.  Customer service is the best; they are quick and problem solvers.  Repeat customer here just leaving a great review! | Always  treat me with the most respect and good service along with best prices. | Super user friendly and informational. Has everything you need all in one spot Absolutely love it and use it every time. | Every time I search a place I want to visit; it never loads. The app freezes and I have to close out the app and restart it. And it always happens. Got tired of it and just deleted the app altogether. Very inconvenient for the user. | .good | Well done! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èyou exceeded my expectations:)!üíú‚úåÔ∏èmuch ‚ù§Ô∏è love! | Love the app , just I never get any promos/coupons | They didn‚Äôt put lettuce in any of my items and I added. Also my side sauce was totally missing. This is not acceptable. | Room was old but clean when we got there. We stayed 4 nights while we visited NYC. 1st night we got back late room had been cleaned and everything was fine. The next 3 days room was a mess. No service in room No garbage, No towels, No Cups, No beds made. We complained and had to go get our own towels to shower.  Electrical plugs don‚Äôt work in half of room.  Smelled bad in Halls. We were not happy at all. Ask the day we were checking out for some kind of payment back to card. Nothing! Breakfast was ok it the same everyday never changes. Lobby was pretty decorated for Christmas. The Shuttle drivers were very nice they took us to NJ Transit. Just remember they Don‚Äôt pick up after 11:00pm. Your on your own then.  If I were you I would look for a better hotel I know I‚Äôll never go back there. | After praying about the trip, we booked tickets from Chicago to Bangkok for nearly half of what others paid going on the same trip. | Emma | O had to cancel and get another hotel because it was no water at that hotel.
I try to cancel and change hotel but there was no option. I had to pay again for the one next to comfort inn
And get Hampton inn | At the last moment price change. | Thank you! | Great prices | I‚Äôve been sitting in the waiting room for over an hour. This place has NO business being a car rental company. They have 20 Customers fuming with how slow they are‚Ä¶ ridiculous! | Terrible site.

Tried help but no links to customer service. üòµ‚Äçüí´ | This app once installed spy‚Äôs on your phone and monitors your web searches. | helped me book a fun affordable excursion for my trip ! | It will not work if you try to only allow access to add to calendar. It wants full access to your calendar. This is too invasive. Tours are easy to book and manage though, other than that | If your experience goes well then the app is great. I called support for help with a booking for them only to screw it up and cause additional problems. 

I was charged a different amount then the confirmation email and spoken with multiple people to try to resolve. I have received plenty of emails asking for reviews, which I have left. 
Activity: good
Viator support experience: terrible

I even asked for someone to contact me and have not been contacted. I spoke with someone today who was able to refund the difference of the cost to the correct amount on my confirmation email. 

If your still reading my advice: avoid 3rd party apps like this and book directly from the source | I used the website and app twice in Hawaii and in DC. The recommendations and descriptions have worked out each time. Enjoyed each tour and trip without a mishap. I always recommend it since. | We have always recommended and used Viator. | If you don‚Äôt know , this island can be expensive ,  but with this app I found all the amusement i was interested in for a very low exciting price so thank you so much for being so convenient towards my fun factor and my wallet. Also I  earned some dollar rewards towards my next purchases. That‚Äôs Awesome  , I‚Äôm enjoying this app and taking full advantage for my future adventures. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç | I booked a hot air balloon ride in Mexico City to see the pyramids in November. The tour company called me the night before to inform me I needed to reschedule. I could not as I was on travel and I requested a refund immediately. 

They didn‚Äôt answer for about a month so I disputed the claim on my card. Viator proceeded to fight (and won) my dispute and I‚Äôm now stuck with just under $500 in charges for services I didn‚Äôt receive. I‚Äôm never using this service again. | Major Bug

*** trying to add a password to account freezes the browser window. | Unable to move tickets from my email into this app to save my life, have sent email links into and out of 3 different mobile browsers, only to end up back at the same ‚Äúcheck email‚Äù screen.

Making it extremely difficult to prepare effectively for my upcoming trip | I wanted to book a tour, but they require a date of birth.  How absurd.  Why would they need that.  They lost business of that. | As a solo traveler, it‚Äôs nice to have an easy way to book and check excursions. I have booked two excursions for my first trip to Puerto Rico and it is nice that they you give you the option to reserve your spot and pay later. App is very user friendly. | Tours and events are canceled frequently due to ‚Äúsmall group size‚Äù | This app good | I can no longer access any of my booked tours, even to check times and locations,  without allowing for for push notifications. | Someone on a different device sharing the same WiFi network was automatically logged into my Viator account without me having used their device. Lawsuit waiting to happen. Hope their dev team is able to rectify this immediately. | I booked an experience that was a scam. The people told us we could get a refund but Viator did not give it to us, they protected the scammers, be very careful booking experiences through this app. | Have spent 40mins trying to login. Directs me to a one time email which then directs me to safari to sign in. All good. Then I try to access tickets and open up the app to it asking me to do a one time email login, and the entire cycle repeats. Seems like a great directory for services but doesn‚Äôt matter if I can‚Äôt access my tickets | I have used Viator for many travels and in different countries. I have never had any issues. Very accommodating site. | Not able to login through app. The email only redirects to the browser | There is strongest storm hitting bay on Feb-4/Feb-5, for international traveler that arrived and want to cancel result in no refund and pay 100% due to weather. Not recommended! | Viator is great but the app isn‚Äôt.

You would think when you buy something it is downloaded to the app, so you have it even if their is no internet. But no.

When I try to open it to get my tickets, I have to give my email address. It then offers to send a one time link to my email that opens to the same Home Screen that asks me for my email address. 
Viator customer service was great and sent me copies of the tickets. But don‚Äôt count on getting in with the app. | Easy to use and communicate with local providers. | The only thing the app does is give you a message that it can‚Äôt connect. It reminds me of the ‚Äútechnical difficulties‚Äù placard on 1978 television. | The app needs to show the full itineraries for the things we have booked. Not just the start times and meeting points. I‚Äôd like to see the full itinerary. I hope that‚Äôs something the app can change. | I hope this message helps other people when booking for what is believed a reputable company.

I purchase an all inclusive pass for activities in Berlin for 48 hours, back in September. I communicated with Viator right away and as I was waiting in line; Viator failed to provide us with proper QR codes, refused a refund and lost about $203.00 and the time to fully enjoy Germany. So, I Lost money, time and will take no responsibility to help, please read the BBB and you been warned | Can‚Äôt wait ! | Very efficient and convenient to find tours, etc. | Wow!  Just wow... I've seen bad interfaces but this takes the cake as far as Viator's actual app is concerned.  Just use the web site, don't waste your time w/their app! | When I looked for tours of Ann Frank house there was only one called the Ann Frank tour but apparently it did not include the house. I found that very misleading and annoying. | We recently booked a tour in Paris, we missed the our due to flight was delayed overnight, I called Viator to reschedule but there is no availability so a $550 wasted. Viator said their local tour operator refused to refund which I can understand, but Viator should at least have a solution for this type of situation, such as give us credits for future tour. | I have tried accessing my tickets 8 times both online via mobile device and the viator app but the two just keep asking me to confirm by logging into the other one. I even recently installed, uninstalled, and installed the app again. | Gone are the days of exceptional customer service‚Ä¶.except when it comes to Viator! I am quite impressed with now three times in dealing with their customer service. They are on it! They hire well. | Yes the Mt Cook/Lake Tekapo day trip from Christchurch is stunning and not to be missed. However, I do have to give a big two thumbs up to Viator. I booked this trip at the last minute during high peak season. They were able to squeeze my son and I in. They were in constant communication and very responsive to emails in arranging a pickup point as we were not staying at a hotel. On a 13.5 hour bus trip you need a great tour guide and Anuj was more than that. He kept a great schedule to ensure everyone had sufficient time at all the rest stops/scenic spots. He even dropped some of the passengers to late eateries when most places were closed when we returned to Christchurch. | I couldn‚Äôt get my tickets downloaded from my email. It told me to download the app, so I did. Every time I would try to get my tickets in the app it would tell me to click on the link from the email. So I would, and it would send me right to the app telling me to open the email link. It was seriously so annoying. | The problem with Viator comes when something from your tour or travel goes wrong. I had the necessary proof that a tour company did not try to help us when they lost us in a tour and Viator sited with them and did not refund. After all the proof and went after every detail that happen they said they‚Äôre unable to grant me a refund because the company denied any wrong doing. Go to another app for booking because Viator will never have your back even after proof. Just look at the other comments. | App is easy to use and book expeditions!!! | I arch what you pay for I had an island hoping package in boracay and after waiting for 2 hours and getting my calls declined from your guises I asked for my money back and Viator Al said it won‚Äôt refund money even though I am at pickup spot and had called a day b4 I would not recommend it almost ruined my proposal moment super upset | Viator is fantastic! I have used it in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. and it‚Äôs awesome every single time! I don‚Äôt want to use anything else for fun traveling tours! | We booked an English tour and not a soul spoke English so we had no information which defeated the point of booking. Viator was rude and did not help us at all and kept our money. Use a different app | Son s√∫per buenos en lo q hacen | Horrible app. They allow scams and tour operators to steal your money. They use fake bots to leave good reviews | The app UI and overall experience was designed by a team that really doesn‚Äôt get it. They don‚Äôt understand how people travel and I don‚Äôt think they themselves travel. That‚Äôs the only way I can make sense of it. It‚Äôs like if some people decided on a Zoom meeting that ‚Äúwe think hypothetical people travel like this‚Äù.

Notes and itinerary are hidden once you purchase the ticket. Why?

Annoying, cluttered, and useless screens and information that adds little value.

Difficult to search inside a location. Trying to find something you saw earlier inside a particular city? Good luck.

Difficult to figure out how to contact tour operator. 

No obvious notifications in-app when tour operator contacts.

I could keep going. I‚Äôve had great experiences with Viator but the app was clearly designed by a committee. | I cannot sign into the app with an email address. Each time, the app directs me to the website and bypasses the app. Definitely needs to be fixed. | Worst customer service ever. Use GetYourGuide | The email link didn‚Äôt work.  I had to sign out and resign in. | Why I wasn‚Äôt able to use the promo code
EXTRA15 | We only had a few hours on our cruise ship stop in Ephesus and we wanted to see as much as we can. Lutfi, our host made sure we saw what we wanted without feeling rushed. We went to Mary‚Äôs house, a full tour of Ephesus and St John‚Äôs Basilica. 

Everything was taken care of, extremely informative and we loved the history lesson we had from such a knowledgeable guide. 

We highly recommend using this tour guide any occasion whether you have just a short time or days to explore. | I have been trying to login since last 10 mins‚Ä¶it is keep on shuffling me between my

Used to use it all the time. Now will go elsewhere | No matter what region you select, it only returns one result for a paid tour in Japan. No other information, guides, or content present. | This app will help me dream bigger‚Ä¶ | Just signed up with culture tour ap.  It has a lot of information and good travel deals. | Half the content or more doesn‚Äôt open. 
Yes I‚Äôve tried to reset phone and update app and all other apps are working and wifi is fine | Usually really useful, the app does not seem to work properly. When I go check out the Guides, it just closes down the app | All of my saved trips are gone. 
All of my bookmarks are gone. 
The guides aren‚Äôt really there anymore, it‚Äôs just paid tours offerings that you can sign up for. 
I will be undownloading and not recommending to friends anymore until the app is better‚Ä¶ | From 1 to 4 years ago I used this app frequently to reference the guides when planning trips.  But sometime within the past year the guide function returns zero results for most of the world.  Many countries and cities that previously had many links through the app now have nothing. | I used to love this app and recommended it to everyone. It is so disappointing that I can‚Äôt search for anything, nor even access my saved trips. Please bring back the other features. | I used to peruse the app to find articles of places to try and now it doesn‚Äôt work at all.  Seems like they are pivoting to selling tours. ü§¢ Shame. | I used to love the content on this app but the app doesn‚Äôt work anymore. | This app has so much potential‚Ä¶if only it worked. Some of the options to select aren‚Äôt being selected when I try to click on them. I also charged the currency to $USD and prices are still showing up in ¬£. I can‚Äôt access ‚ÄúMy Plans‚Äù even though I saved a couple things there. To top it off, the app keeps crashing. Not a really good experience. | Was a decent app a few years ago in terms of articles, insights, and travel recommendations, but now is nothing more than a sales site aimed at selling trips/experiences. Collected a data base of potential customers over the years and then transitions to a sales site. Classic. | Don‚Äôt bother downloading the app. 

Not sure what changed in their business model but this app is really just for booking group trips now. I used to use it as a way to find cool local things to do in cities I used to travel to. Great way to plan a trip with blogs about tourist destinations, cafes, restaurants. | Can‚Äôt even search for a city. Used this for years and now it‚Äôs unusable. | Look I get it that businesses pivot. But you used to be my trusted travel blog that I would come to for every trip for cool recommendations. Now I cannot even find the guides because they‚Äôre so hidden behind your big push toward your new shiny object, the tours. 

Some of us veterans aren‚Äôt interested in tours. We came to your blog for self guided guides! I really wish that you‚Äôd make the guides findable for us in the native apps and web apps. | Sadly this app no longer works. I‚Äôm not sure why, but nothing will load. And it is extremely glitchy! | Hard to tell what the purpose of the app really is because it won't load anything, and yes, I'm connected to the internet. | This was once a fantastic app for things to do and see in places around the world.  All of that useful content is gone. Now it is just a booking app for group trips. | I‚Äôve been trying for weeks to get it to work and it does not load. Based on other reviews this is not an isolated issue. | This was one of the best sources of information especially for out of the way locales - the local guides on galleries, fashion, etc was superb. Please bring back the guides and local stories. The app is now glitchy and no longer links well to ‚Äúthings to do‚Äù or ‚Äúfood and drink‚Äù which made this an invaluable resource. | It‚Äôs a frustrating app which is sad because I love the offline articles and content. If I can get the app wouldn‚Äôt glitch so much. A simple search won‚Äôt upload the content | It crashes every few minutes!!! My saved pages went blank. Do I need to say anymore?  Very sad‚Ä¶ | Really sad to see the latest performance. I guess that‚Äôs there now Hass to be 3 inches of advertising on every page, however, you could just get the pages to load and I‚Äôd It be much happier. As I travel 100#, it‚Äôs sad to see this occur. | There used to be a method for searching for many interesting articles on various culture areas. That‚Äôs been removed and you only get opportunities to buy travel packages. 

Bummer. Delete. | Love the articles, hate the app itself. I‚Äôve used it for years but no long can stand it. Doesn‚Äôt save my favorites, can‚Äôt even search easy travel spots that I know there are articles for. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app and downloading a newer version. It‚Äôs useless. | I like the content but half the time there‚Äôs a white screen or an infinite loading state. | I‚Äôm able to register, search (slowly), but nothing shows up. Would love to use but the app needs to kinda work first. | It was a great app until the only thing you can access is now the paid trips that you can buy. I had articles saves for a trip I was planning (37 to be exact), and when I went to access my saved trip the articles no longer were there. Try to search for new articles? They appear on the front page of the app, unless you care to actually read them. When you click on the article nothing pulls up. Useless. | Location services seem to be down. Just downloaded the app, so I have no way to know if that‚Äôs an ongoing issue. ‚Äî There‚Äôs also no way to look up a smaller city and populate places in terms of distance. That would be really helpful. ‚Äî A map option to manually set my location would be a way around both of these issues and doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to populate a list on the map. | I booked a trip with culture trip and I am trying to edit the ‚Äútravel plans‚Äú and I am not able to do anything nor I see instructions on how to. | I miss the feature that showed you popular attractions and restaurants based on your current location | I have used this ap for several years now and my application for the vast information about even the remote corners of the world continues to grow.

Every travel lover needs this ap for their travel planning. | The app has not worked properly for me the last few months. It doesn‚Äôt let me search places, won‚Äôt display my plans, and it doesn‚Äôt save articles to my plans. I have updated it and nothing has changed. | I have imagine such a travel guide app for years. | I love the idea but plans and saved places get lost. My app says I have 6  plans, the webpage says 8, and neither show the 25 places added to my plan, 
Repeat issue | Very useful app for travelers. | A lot of the places have closed or moved since Covid. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be many additions since 2020. There is a lack of inclusion of black, Hispanic and lgbtq places. 

I think the app is a great idea and off to a good start but needs some work | There ‚Äòsave‚Äô feature is a mess and dies nit work. A waste of time. | This used to be a really cool app where you‚Äôd find great articles/suggestions for destinations. Guess it got bought out or something. Seems like it‚Äôs more of a booking platform now. Too bad. | Anytime the app actually loads I feel very lucky. Usually I open it and am just made angry as it loads for eternity. Seem every couple of week the app become unusable. The content is good which i would think is the hard part. The app is abysmal. Get it together guys. | I loved this app. I even gave it 5 stars. I now am unable to even enter the app. It freezes on start! I deleted it and reinstalled it several times to no avail.

Update: 28 May 2022 - the latest update has fixed the issues from before. Thank you!! | Help | I used to use this app all the time to help with trip planning. Recently it has totally stopped working; I cannot save any posts and cannot even log on the app. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it to see if it would fix the problem but it has not. I can‚Äôt access any plans I made previously either. The problem started around the time they took away the section about hotels/hotel booking. That was always a useful way to find out key details about amenities, neighborhoods, etc. Even without hotel information, the app would still be useful to plan dining and activities for travel. Unfortunately, due to its lack of functionality, the app is close to useless now. This has been weeks or months now. | Sign up sign in just don‚Äôt work for me | Looks like a good app but I can‚Äôt get in | Installed and used for a while, then upgraded an iPhone, all my saved data is gone, can‚Äôt log in, can‚Äôt use the app, gets stuck after the initial splash screen, can‚Äôt create a new account either. | Planning a summer getaway to Los Angeles, it was easy to navigate through this app with articles like ‚Äò19 Best Things To Do‚Äô and ‚Äò10 Best Hidden Gem Hotels‚Äô containing descriptive information, plenty of photos, and then use discount booking codes for great room deals. | I love their content but the app is not working well for me, doesn‚Äôt let me log in or explore the platform as a

It is easy to use, and works as advertised. Fun! | I've been looking for a substitute for TripAdvisor's Travel Map for some time.  This is it. These guys have a simple, clean, and robust platform. Unlike trip advisor they are extremely helpful and the data is yours...not trapped behind some protected server.  I'm moving all my pins over now and they even have offered to help make the switch!  

Thanks guys. Great App. | Excellent, but how would you even be able to obtain the North Korea flag(unless you‚Äôre an important person)? | It‚Äôs very hard to use. I keep changing the color of the pins‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.they are still red. | If you have been to more than 50 places you have to pay! No thanks! Removing app from my device! | The title of my review says it all. You cannot do anything without joining so it was wasted time to download. | This is by far the best travel journal I have!
I tried mutiple ones and this is the only one
 I ended up keeping and loving! Sure you have to pay for a lifetime premium but it's like buying yourself a travel diary and it will store all your memories forever! Every feature that I wanted on a travel diary is on this app! Add as many photos to every country you went too, pin places you've been to in that country and you can even specify which city you went to and also add photos and pins to that specific city!

The developers are very responsive and has good communication when I had problems. They never leave it unresolved!

This app has gotten better with the updates since I started using it back and 2021! Love love love this app! I can't wait to see what it has to offer this year! 
Loving the new Valentines heart pin, btw ü©∑ | This is a great way to document your travels. I have been using this app for almost a year and it is my go to travel app. I document all my trips on the app, add tons of pictures and now it even has a route map which is very cool. The two developers are always working on new ideas and are very receptive to suggestions. You can even go back in and put in past trips and countries you have visited. Can‚Äôt say enough for this app!! | This program supercharges the old concept of putting pins in a map. The zoom in zoom out feature on the world maps gives a fantastic ability to see an overview or detail of places visited. The number of countries visited or the percentage of countries in the world visited allows a clear picture of how far your travels have taken you. Truly outstanding for a visualization of your travel history. | I have wanted and easy way to keep track of all the places I have been and this is sooooo it! I searched through so many apps like it but they were all way too complicated and not as easy to use as pin traveler! Totally recommend for any traveler. The only thing that I don‚Äôt like is that premium is expensive. I would totally get it because I love the app but I‚Äôm a broke student traveler who is spending all my money on new trips soooo I can‚Äôt spend the money but maybe one day! Love this app though! Totally recommend! | Best travel destination tracking app ever. | Premium kinda dumb, too expensive but nothing is that much better, it is worth it for the memories | The first explore I got for a place had as #1 a restaurant across a river from the neighborhood I chose. It also listed a place that has been closed for three years. | Une superbe application pour suivre nos voyages et se rappeler des chemins parcourus ! | Such a user friendly way to keep all your travel locations (and possibly memories) in one place. Every time I open the app I get a big picture of where I want to go next. | You will be limited to 50 pins if you don‚Äôt pay for some version. | Was so great until they put all of the features that used to be free behind a pay wall. You barely get any access without paying $25/year. Don‚Äôt download it. | Gives you a max of 50 pins then wants money. Really? $2.99 a week??  Other options and all over priced. Deleting after posting review | I am a frequent International traveler. Pin traveler has been a joy to use to keep track of countries and cities I have visited. 

I recently had to resolve a question about my subscription and the guys at Pin Traveler were a pleasure to deal with, very quick responses, and everything was straightened out immediately. 

Great app with excellent customer service. I highly recommend it to anyone who travels and would like to easily keep a log of their journeys. | I like it, it works as advertised
I really use it just for the pin feature to see almost the exact places I‚Äôve been but it‚Äôs pretty cool üëç | I‚Äôm addicted to this app. It‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for to document my travels! This app would be perfect if you could list the places costed such as restaurants etc like you can fit the cities costed instead of having to tap into a city pin. | By far the best ""places traveled"" app. I use it very simply (just pin places I've been and then wishlist places I want to go to) but it's perfect and elegant and doesn't pressure you too spend money. And the nifty extra features are very cool. Thank you for making this!!! | 50 free pins, then $40 to continue. Would have been nice to know in the beginning. Delete. | Finally after years of looking for a travel diary, and over 10 travel diary apps downloaded and removed, I finally found what I‚Äôm looking for. This has everything I have searched for, all the features I looked for, finally found in this one app. This app should be renamed ‚ÄúPin Travel Journal Diary. For years I would search apps with search keywords ‚Äútravel diary‚Äù or ‚Äútravel Journal‚Äù in the apple App Store and unfortunately this app never popped up. I believe its due to the keyword ‚Äúpin‚Äù. This app is amazing! It has the capability of so much! These features include, jotting down your travel experiences like you would in a travel journey, you adding photos, Pinning locations on world map, display country flags that you visited, notates the number of places visited, provides a wishlist of places you want to visit, there is so much more! The one thing that I believe this app should try to include in the future is the ability to create a photo book. This would be another benefit or option to be available for users. I love this app. Thank you developers! | Only allows 50 destinations for free version.. pretend users to pay iver $20/year for full service | I found this app a couple of years ago and I love it! It is such a great way to keep track of all our travels around the world. | Can‚Äôt type in national parks or smaller towns. Only allows pins of major cities. Rather useless. | I use this to document each new city that I send an order to with my business. I love keeping track on how far my designs have reached around the world. Thank you!! üß° | Limiting free users to only 50 destinations is a waste of my time. | They want annual subscription for you to map more than 50 pins.   Very disappointed. | Don‚Äôt appreciate being told about about costs associated with this app after you register into an account | This app is good but they can improve you should be able to type In a address.and you should be able to put pictures on the address 
For free. | I have a job role that allows me to travel, plus I have always liked to get out and see the world. Using Pin Traveler is a great way to keep track, I would recommend it to anyone. | I like the app and especially the potential of the app as they make improvements. Using this as our trip journal. Can just click on a stay and see note Anne‚Äôs photos related specifically to that stay. You can also just see your total status across many trips. Very responsive to my email. | Been looking for an app like this for years. Really happy to have found it. Great place to memorialize trips and to add places to visit in the future.  Support was really helpful too. Love this app!!! | This is such a great app but it‚Äôs very confusing to use in order to get stats on your various trips. | Limits you to 50 places then tries to rip you off for their subscription nonsense what a scam | While I‚Äôll go for in app purchases but when the download immediately demands purchase without providing any service I call it a scam. | I‚Äôm rating it low because I paid for the premium and no matter how many times I‚Äôve emailed I‚Äôm still asked to sign up for it. It keeps giving me the free version. | Just started using it but I love it! Will recommend it to others! | The free version limits you to 50 pins. I‚Äôve been to more than 50 places in the past three years. Too expensive to log all my places. I‚Äôm out. | Very nice app for travelers | I like the idea but‚Ä¶You only get 50 pins for free before you have to pay a premium price for more pins. I bet I can use 50 pins before I even reach 100 miles of my home town. I don‚Äôt want or even need all the extra features. I just want to be able to record a new city I visit so I can look back on my travels. Silly that they think I will pay that much for pins. Why not have unlimited pins and pay for the extra features.

I will be deleting right after this review is posted. 

Only way for me to return is free unlimited pins. | I used this app during my trip to Toronto. It was super useful to pin restaurant and cafes I'd been to and wishlist places I want to go. I even got places recommended for me using their new AI features. Seeing all of the countries I've been to is also great and makes me want to travel more!! Premium is definitely worth it for people who travel frequently. | This app is very close to what I consider ideal. The only feature, and possibly I‚Äôm missing it, is to be able to drop a pin exactly where I was. In my case, the Arctic and Antarctica, the app just drops a pin in the middle of each, no where near where I was at. May be minor for most but this would make it perfect for me | This is so much better than scrolling through Apple photos endlessly to look over my travels. Organising with pins on a map is so much better!

It not only allows me to add everything to a quick view schedule, but also allows me to add documents that I normally had to rewrite not notes on other apps. Ir can find your flights, carrier, hotel and resort! All in a nicely laid out interface.  I use it on an iPad Mini and it looks awesome. | I love I can organize stuff for myself and collaborate on trips with my wife, and it supports everything. Tours, cruises, restaurants, adding files and photos, everything. And lots of clever features sprinkled throughout. Fantastic app. | I've been using TripIt (Pro) for years, but I've always found its interface cumbersome and confusing. While TripIt's new interface is better, I much prefer Tripsy for all my travel planning and tracking.  

Tripsy's clean visual design is beautiful and efficient. The main screen displays the most essential information for my trip or, when traveling, for the current leg of my journey. Details for any portion of the trip are usually just a click away. Tripsy has all the main features that you'd expect from a travel app, such as multiple ways to gather travel documents into a trip (search email, forward an email, Mac/iOS sharing, etc), integration with device calendars, support for multiple travelers and non-traveling planners, document upload, etc. TripIt still has an edge in integrations with other travel apps or services. I suspect Tripsy will add more partnerships as they grow and develop. If there is something you want or need to do in TripIt, Tripsy has the option to sync from  TripIt automatically. I used this option when I started using Tripsy, which made that initial transition (or even a trial) so much easier because I didn't need to reimport my documents for planned trips. 

Tripsy lost a few points in this review because of a few areas where it took effort to accomplish some tasks. There are some quirks in importing the cruise portion of a trip. Most cruise data was imported without a hitch; however, it didn't grab the departure time for days in port. I tried manually adding the departure times for a day in port, but it was annoyingly complex. I'd open the detail for a particular day, but I needed help figuring out how to add the departure time, or when I did, I could only choose from predetermined times. Eventually, I found that I had to select a predetermined time, save the changes, open the details again, scroll down to the proper date of my trip and then I could finally set the appropriate time. This problem doesn't happen often, but it is currently a pain. 

Overall, though, I love using Tripsy!! It is now my go-to travel app. | It really helps plan trips and only one person needs a subscription for everyone to collaborate in the app for a trip. | overall great program.  needs a slight interface overhaul (each day should be very subtle different color than others to easily differentiate them).  And I would highly recommend a calendar view. | If you have an itinerary already defined, this app may help document it.  But if you're actually planning and exploring options, it will get slow you down and make a mess in your calendar database.  Also, I got billed for a month even though I cancelled quickly. | Here are my issues so far-- 1) Multiple times, the entries I have put in and saved change on their own. Train times, for instance, will modify themselves to whatever they want (right now I have a train entry that leaves at 8:42PM and arrives at 8:42PM, despite putting in the accurate times). It is not a time change issue, either, they're just random times and AM/PM. This is very annoying and I'm about to give up on this tool. 2) We're flying halfway across the world and you have to scroll to see the map entirely, no way to zoom out and show the whole trip on the screen. You can zoom in...but you can't zoom out to show Florida and Australia on the same map screen. 3) I subscribed to a monthly plan and was surprised to have recently been charged for a year's access. It just seems like ""Save"" doesn't mean what you think it does in this app. I was really excited to get organized, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere, like TripIt. | Unable to even put in dated. Date Screen does not scroll to find the correct month. Figures a work around but once I put in the ending date, the program changes the start date so the trip is ony 1 day....unless I set the trip up without dates but it is difficult to add places for the new days. | Â¶ÇÊûúÂä†‰∏äÊØèÊÆµË°åÁ®ãËä±Ë¥πÂ§öÂ∞ëÈí±Ëøô‰∏™ÂäüËÉΩÂ∞±Êõ¥Â•Ω‰∫Ü | Tried to change to this because I was over trip it. Not pulling in the text from the email and when I search for what I need it keeps showing something in the wrong country. No thanks. Making my life harder | This product can do more to help plan for your vacation than the free platforms. Both this company and apple customer service are unwilling to listen and help resolve my issue with this platform. | This is a great travel planner APP. It works very well and is reliable. Their customer service is excellent as well. If you are looking for a travel planner APP with a lifetime purchase, just try this one! | I am offering 4-stars in this review solely based on the apps' potential and the current user interface design friendliness. The apps' current state and functionality is actually about a 2-star. I hope to update this review shortly to full 5-star based on some things getting taken care of.
Easier itinerary control - went to manually add (I didn't have easy access to the email), a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport for an early flight, and I couldn't do that because the app had already defined the trip as Thursday to Tuesday based on the flight, with me trying to add a Wednesday ""activity"". I had to go into the settings for the itinerary and change the beginning date. (A further annoyance, rather than just changing one date, once I set the new start, it also required the ending, rather than keeping it on the same by default. There should be a way when adding an activity to go ‚Äúoutside the dat boundary‚Äù and have the app automatically update the overall itinerary timeframe.
Side-note to above‚Ä¶ The share-to-Tripsy function in the Hilton app only brought hotel name and phone number, not the booked dates, res# or other actual booking details - another potential fix? I don‚Äôt know if that is Tripsy not importing correctly, or Hilton not exporting & sharing properly.
Better functionality required for the planning part of a trip. Right now, this app just kind of ‚Äúcatches‚Äù all the emails you forward it (or painfully add in manually). When you think of booking a trip, say a vacation getaway, there are many pieces to it (the very reason for this app). Resort, flights, transport from airport to resort, excursions while there, maybe a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport with park-and-fly arrangements. Not all that stuff is booked at once. So being able to easily add in each aspect that needs to be booked, and then have each of those activity icons color-coded on the itinerary page (ie. Red for needs booking, yellow for booked, green for booked and pre-paid) really is necessary. Being able to manually change the color of each activity icon would be a simple step. More complex would be adding in 2 checkboxes in the activity (or right-click / hold-click pop up menu) to indicate when it is booked and when it is paid. Next level of complexity would be for the app to automatically color code based on the details provided in the activity (company and res # fields filled out automatically determines ‚Äúbooked‚Äù status, I‚Äôm not sure how it would determine paid).
 
Again, overall I like the direction this app is going, but it really needs these updates to become the true ‚ÄúGo-To Travel Planner‚Äù. Currently, it is leagues beyond it‚Äôs main competitor. Enough that I subscribed to Pro for a year. But without these necessary changes, that subscription will not get extended. Yes, those changes are that necessary, and without them I will go back to Excel and OneNote to manage all my travel, as the app would be missing the ‚Äúease‚Äù functionality that it should have vs. a more manual process.
Hopefully the devs read this and put these ideas in place very soon. I am sure they have a ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù, but for true traveler functionality, these need to be inserted in the immediate stages of that roadmap.
Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!!! | Several of my trips that are complete on one device are showing up as one-day trips on days where I don‚Äôt have travel planned. For example, if I have a trip planned from 11-17 March, the trip shows up as 25-25 March on other devices and shared links. None of the activities are syncing across devices. Reached out to support several weeks ago but haven‚Äôt heard back and the issue still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. Just know that paying for the premium features is worth it when it works, but if it stops working you‚Äôll be dealing with awful customer support.

A suggestion - would you please consider adding a feature that allows me to set to-do reminders for my trip? It would would be so helpful to be able to set a reminder then later received a push notification. Thank you!! | I was a long time TripIt user and Tripsy is better in every way imaginable | I had been searching for a good itinerary app ever since Google Trips shut down years ago. Tripsy is the best one I've used since then. The auto-import by email (for flights, hotels, cars etc) works great and has only gotten more reliable over the year I've been using it. The iOS and Mac apps are both super easy to use and visually appealing. | have you considered adding a ""packing list"" feature for our trips? | This is a great app. I have used it on multiple trips and I can‚Äôt live without it now. The only thing missing is that I would like a way to keep a packing list with a quantity field. So I can always make sure I have everything ready prior to a trip and before a return. | Sadly, was hoping this would be app that might work to share itinerary with other humans traveling with me without them having to buy. Nope. Also, had to manually enter 4 of 6 flts and 1 hotel. Even when trying to share from hotel app to create event had to manually enter data. All of this would be fine but when share itinerary with others it does not provide any details (times of flights, flt #, resv etc | Just got it and it provides no guidance as to how to use the app, how to upload reservations; adding guests seems impossible.... | This app is pretty good and very helpful. However I wish the native Mac app felt more Mac-like. As it is, it feels very much like a big iPhone app. I was hoping that planning my trip and making adjustments would have been much easier on my Mac, but I feel the UI and workflow is very limited since it feels like it is a scaled up iPhone app that does not adequately take advantage of the Mac. It is very good, but I wish it could better take advantage of what the Mac can allow for productivity! | Good app and looking forward to using it for future trips.  Would greatly appreciate a field for cost/expense.  We like to work withina budget and this would greatly help. | Searching and adding a flight is too clunky, taking too many steps. The whole UI feels huge like the buttons are massive, but it doesn't make it more usable. You can have different dates than your flights and it doesn't auto update the actual trip dates. You can accidentally add the same flight twice. Buttons aren't labeled, making the intended flow unclear. Basically feels like a more manual version of Kayak, since I'm not paying for the pro version so I can't do email sync. | I download Mac App and iPhone app. At first I ran into problem where the trip from Mac app does not sync. I email support and the Co-Founder responded to me and help diagnose the issue really fast. In face I never had this fast response from app developer before. And the step to diagnose and communication this is straightforward and sincere.

Apart from that, the app has intuitive user interface and easy to understand and can sync with multiple devices and with friends whom I shared the trip with. This eliminated the need to manually create initerary, which reduce times and free us to explore the activities instead. | Wowww. What a good travel app. Very easy going and with all the information and set up for the best experience travel management | I decided to try the app out because I'm looking for an app that can handle travel planning and has a nice UI, which this one does. 

However I noticed while creating an account that the form fields aren't labeled correctly so you can't auto-generate a password from Keychain.This is coming from a developer so I know how easy it is to integrate those small security features in form fields. This was the first red flag. 

So I made a temporary password and I thought I'd change it afterwards to a more secure password, but there's no option to change my password in the app? I read the other reviews about the support being non-existent, along with the developer not responding to feedback in the app store reviews makes me not trust the construction of this app, or being able to get basic support if something goes wrong (keep in mind this app has paid features). I just deleted the app after deleting my account. | The interface is beautiful but the actual implementaion is terrible. Tried several times to add an event and itinerary and it never showed up. I might have even duplicated the subscription in trying to fix the issue. My reccomendation is to go with TripIt. Not as pretty but it works. | Pro user here for a few years now. I absolutely love the planning aspect but the number of unresolved bugs is incredibly frustrating. Support is nonexistent, you won‚Äôt get an answer for weeks. There are issues with timezones, findings things, flight schedules, sync and many others. Each update breaks something. I am really unhappy at this point and will not renew our subscription next year. | A really solid travel organization app. All the nice features you want. If you travel it‚Äôs easily worth the subscription price. | I love this app and use it constantly. It has been a game changer for me. Very much appreciate the regular improvements. | I would have probably signed up for the paid service and enjoyed the app. However, I found a charge on my card via my apple account before ever using the app. Canceled subscription. | I have used this app twice this year - a two week trip to Spain, and a five week road trip of the east coast of the united states.  In both cases, I found myself a slave to the app. The cost of setting up parts of a trip, in terms of effort, was much greater than the benefit I got from it. I put this app in a drawer and only pulled it out occasionally. I am happy to let this infernal subscription expire until I MAYBE want to use it again in two years.

I like the app, kinda. It looked good at first. It is good at organizing itineraries, as long as those itinerary are AirBnB and organized tours and have a rigid order that will NEVER change. Other parts of my travel plan, like mapping, seem forced and clunky. I had to find ways to do these outside this app.

After a while I started treating this app as a wallet that held a collection of ideas. Adding and removing things from the itinerary took WAY too much effort. Items simply didn't like to move.

I guess I am not their target market. It is too much of a marginal benefit for me keep paying for. It would be worth a fixed charge with paid upgrades, but this is in no way such a life-changing app that I want to keep paying and paying for it. A folder with a collection of links and copies of my reservations works just as well.

Subscription cancelled. | It does not sync with phone and laptop and my phone is missing trips that i put on my laptop!
PLEASE FIX BECAUSE I LOVE THIS APP IF IT WOULD SIMPLY JUST DO THAT | I've been looking for something like Tripsy for a long time.  the closest thing has been tripit but Tripsy seems setup to add the functionality to be the travel suite everyone will use.  It does a pretty good job parsing emails but my AirBB reserveration didnt work. There doesnt seem to be an option for it monitor emails automatically.   It would be nice to be able to drag items from one day/time to another.   The search functionality for new evetns works well.   I love the map feature.  The whole app is worth it for this feature.    Support has been super responsive.  I'm looking forward to growing with them.  Finally theyre doing what no one else could. | I only see, weekly, monthly and yearly as option but not lifetime | Such a great app - but I wish it had 2 small things:

1. The ability to hide flight paths on the map view. I dont want the map to always default to a zoomed out view that doesn‚Äôt show many much relevant detail of the stuff I have planned in my actual destination 

2. The ability to add a location to the itinerary on a certain day, without having to assign it a specific time. I.e. ‚ÄúI want to go here on the second day of my trip, but I don‚Äôt care specifically when‚Äù | love all of the features, email forwarding, gate upates and overall viewpoints. great updates. | I love this app.  It has transformed how I travel!!  I tried out several different apps before finding Tripsy, but Tripsy has the best user interface.  The ability to view everything on the map has been so helpful when deciding what activity to do next based on proximity.  My only suggestion for improvement would be being able to create custom categories or activities.  Sometimes I‚Äôd like to be more specific than just something like ‚Äúfitness,‚Äù especially if we are doing lots fitness type activities in a single trip (golfing, hiking, etc). | I think I tried almost every group travel planning app in the store and on the web, and Tripsy is by far the best for group leisure travel planning. It handles all the fundamentals of planning a trip gracefully and intuitively, without the clutter and noise so prevalent in this category. 

I can think of a few nonessential features that Tripsy lacks, like expense tracking, shared check-lists, and ability to add notes to a date.

But Tripsy delivers on the fundamentals of travel planning ‚Äì which all work seamlessly and intuitively to provide a great user experience ‚Äì in a way that no other app currently does. Highly recommend! | Would not use anyone else! | Setting up two activities in a single day seems to be impossible | Definitely will continue to use this app. I love the in app map feature, makes it so easy to get to places. | I love the app, I used it for my trips with my friends. | I think the developer poured a lot of thought and effort into the app and I do believe that for other travelers it is a worthwhile investment if you need all your travel info in one place and shareable. That said you need not look further because this app has it all. Flights, hotels, and general itinerary management is great! I used the email function and the hit rate was pretty good. A couple hotel bookings didn‚Äôt go through but they were formatted oddly even for human reading so that is certainly not the fault of the ingest system. For standard booking (major airlines and chain hotels) flights and hotels it worked flawlessly. I really appreciated the sharing feature, I had the other family on the trip download the app and they were able to see and add to the itinerary, which was excellent. Overall a well executed app and it is probably well fitting if you need all your travel info in one app that you can share with others.

Post trip update: I want to continue using the app, but after having it for a trip we just didn‚Äôt need to use the functionality - I think I‚Äôm more organized already and it was a chore to move everything to the app rather than just use our existing calendar and weather apps. Also, I think based on the fact I already use Flighty for real-time flight notifications that extra feature wasn‚Äôt needed for me so  I turned off the flight info for the trip. For me it‚Äôs just not something I can see using, THAT SAID, the execution is great and it deserves 5 stars even if it doesn‚Äôt fit my use case. Excellent work, a pleasure to use. | What an app. Blows TripIt out of the water. Always updating and adding new features. Thanks! | When entering a hotel the dates are not visible. Also when changing the dates on an item it reverts back to the old date. These bugs are fixed then appear again. | Every single flight, hotel reservation, excursion conveniently located in one place chronologically. This app is a dream for anyone that wants to be organized or has a busy trip scheduled. Fabulous app, I just can‚Äôt say enough about it! I would recommend to all! | I've planned both a month-long trip in '22, as well as a 10 day trip this year using Tripsy as my digital travel organizer. I absolutely could not be happier with this app and the ability to add even the smallest details and plans. I have the app on three devices and it's flawless. So far there hasn't been a glitch of any kind. I will continue using this app for all of our future travels as long as it's available.";4.69578;2449;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/de/66/36/de663688-50da-18eb-7677-e1757c2bc564/b0c64060-a08f-4bdb-befe-6ae55a286ef2_Intro.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ce/4e/c1/ce4ec1e6-a492-0640-03fa-7cbe1d70de48/207fd846-6a09-47bd-83f0-aabf78dcd12c_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5a/af/b5/5aafb59a-5d6d-61c5-5461-bd421c7556d3/3177ddd7-5fcc-4b30-9c78-f84e8607d000_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/25/1c/39/251c3975-fe25-3d67-54ff-1f382fe07b89/e473061d-29cc-4c2f-8e0b-2d5fbda5a1d8_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8f/26/7f/8f267fa1-5949-5453-85fa-3abad08a7dfb/a1bd7e9f-4eb1-4b59-b153-0caea448b4ea_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d3/9a/49/d39a49aa-fa53-705e-b753-dad78596af57/0ca3eaf4-636a-4588-b444-50d8aa2757b9_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/70/36/6f/70366f2d-b6c8-0bda-d6cf-35170ea52bb0/46188ed7-9da8-4b34-a972-d54f6fd713f4_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e7/84/ee/e784ee37-e856-ff7e-965c-3d7087e03177/614e4fd7-7be1-4fde-b4ad-1d2b6fd2e518_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/83/ee/5c/83ee5ce9-6a8f-117d-a178-6c10eacbaed0/20212e44-be53-45b8-83c5-80f1cb2f1f6a_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/37/04/27/370427e4-2f79-9776-b9f2-4111bbe25c5d/2742267b-eb37-4994-9d89-1da274b3ec0b_9.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4b/8f/01/4b8f01a6-e6e3-48eb-aceb-646e8e5dd424/06fe8bf6-b49a-41e0-b0e3-a2ec692fe4cf_1@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/47/43/21/474321b2-754b-1651-eae2-931c3f6887f6/955359a3-58d3-466b-901b-101615151c74_2@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9f/24/af/9f24af1d-5542-9f10-47a0-f1ed471933ae/13842535-6533-4792-808c-eb6f0aca2891_3@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/37/fa/21/37fa215c-aadf-b625-a4f8-7ba0b7a3dcca/d007491b-4ef7-4a2a-a568-4b784d1f1e59_4@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0e/1a/1c/0e1a1c6e-bfa8-42e0-023a-8a22603add84/9a11790d-5779-4bbd-a463-6dc068e50d67_5@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6f/cc/ba/6fccba70-6e17-7d9b-1fc2-48a3c13b8752/b2856dab-11f0-4895-bb05-43c383649946_6@2x.png/552x414bb.png""]";"[]";"[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"

This company needs to go under, they have no way of cancelling a flight within 24 hours of booking. Instead it‚Äôs only an ‚Äúapplication‚Äù for cancellation and even then it‚Äôs not a full refund.

We literally got notified hours before the first leg of our flight was cancelled and our full trip was unrefundable despite not being able to make our connection.. we got scripted responses from customer support telling us to reach out to the airlines ourselves and now we‚Äôre out hundreds of dollars‚Ä¶ absolute nightmare | Just keep in mind if you ever would need to a change in passenger name or whatever they will charge you for additional service, will keep telling automated replies‚Äùthank you for your patience‚Äù but won‚Äôt be able to solve your issue, because they have lots of greyish ticketing offices in the world whose are actually responsible for your booking, but don‚Äôt now their location and phone numbers. Also they will offer you 0 refund.  Terrible attitude and service! | Selected hotel on google maps, then selected and downloaded trip.com ‚Äî automatically placed most expensive hotels in front of my face and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù hotel I was trying to book. Bozos | It was so easy to book my stay at this historic hotel through Trip.com. The price offered was reasonable. I got a rate with breakfast included! Enjoyed the hotel stay and thanks to this platform! | ÊòØÊàëÊóÖË°åÁöÑÂ•ΩÂπ´Êâã | Garbage app. They screwed up my dates and then wouldn‚Äôt refund my money and blamed the hotel. Called the hotel and they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything because it was through a third party. Don‚Äôt use this, go literally anywhere else | Your first choice to travel all of the world | For hotels they charge you a deposit and tell you what you should pay at the hotel. The price you pay at the hotel is no where near close to what they tell you the price it‚Äôs. They do not disclose any fees the hotels may have and they do not advertise them until after you check out and then you can cancel even tho they changed the price. | Very bad app | Is very good and very easy üòò | Need use it i Thailand for cheap price | Hello, I signed up for a flight with my previously filled in credentials, and for some reason trip did not transfer my middle name when they bought the tickets. Because of this I allost missed my flight, as it didn‚Äôt match my passport information and China requires a middle name. The agent I talked to refused to change it, and they also refused to talk to the airline receptionist, to come to a reasonable and timely solution. Instead, they told me to cancel my flight- mid transfer, pay a fee of 90$, and then rebook a more expensive and later flight. I was waiting to board my flight, and I had already paid and everything told me not to do this, because it was unreasonable. The app wouldn‚Äôt let me manually change the information, even after 4 requests, it rejected them saying the airline disallowed it, even though the receptionist had given me specific directions of contacting trip to change it, so I knew the airline was actually fine with this. This was absurd, to be left without a flight despite the ‚Äòcancellation insurance‚Äô and really hurt the app for future flight purposes for me. | We booked a flight that required a connection. The airline changed one segment to a day later, but not the other segment because Trip.com booked the segments separately. It took us 30 hours to complete a 4-hour flight, and we lost a day of the tour we had paid for, and we had to book a hotel for a night at the layover. Now, the App doesn‚Äôt even find our flights. | I wouldn't recommend this app. Bought a plane ticket through here and the airline didn't provide the services as stated and when I made a claim through the app, they backed the airline. Tired of being used and abused by companies doing whatever they want to the consumer. It's extra bad when it comes to airplane travel. | We booked for 3 nights, offered to pay for the first night, even though the hotel had no aircon, tv, working shower. It literally didn‚Äôt even have a reception area. Had to ask other guests to find the manager. It took like 2 days to get refunded for the last 2 nights. Agoda or Booking is much better. This company should be banned from the internet. | ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | App a bit difficult to manuever but customer service, even if AI is excellent. My trip went smoothly because Wheelchair service was set up for me. I was so grateful and so much stress was lifted from my mind.

Otherwise I cannot select seats for flight and order special meals. I am vegetarian and I was not offered the option, through this site or Thai airways site, to get my meal preference. 

This is not good service, not even cheaper than booking directly. 

Disappointed and you will lose customers. | Â§ßÊï∞ÊçÆÊùÄÁÜüÔºå‰π∞ÂÆåÊú∫Á•®Á¨¨‰∫åÂ§©Êü•ËØ¢Â∞±Èôç‰ª∑ÔºåÊâìÁÆóÂà†Èô§app | Customer service is nothing will not assist when unreasonable involuntary changes are made to your booking .

Other than that everything was easy to use on this app, its fun when u can do some challenges and get rewards for it too‚Ä¶ i mostly use this app for all my booking from now on‚Ä¶ | This app is great because it‚Äôs a one stop shop for all things travel related. The layout and design is also user friendly. Will definitely recommend. | Avoid this app. They cancel your trip one day before and do not help in anything | I recently made multiple bookings on Trip.com.  They sent me emails for each of the bookings.  However, these same bookings do NOT a show up on my trips bookings.  There is no option to type in the booking number to view my hotel.  They require a PIN number which was not included in the email.  When I went through an agent, they said they would update my bookings. They never did. 
Now I am unable to retrieve my bookings.  
Would not recommend this site. | Must have app for travel to Asia; better hotel selection and better prices than other top travel apps. | This app stinks!  They issue tickets in the wrong name of the passenger.  Then not available to fix it! | ÈùûÂ∏∏Êñπ‰æøÁöÑËªü‰ª∂ÔºåÊñπ‰æøÂÆ¢Êà∂‰ΩøÁî®ÔºåÊàëÊúÉÊé®Ëñ¶ÂÆ∂‰∫∫ÊúãÂèã‰ΩøÁî® | I checked several flights and car rentals, but came up with no good deals for both domestic & international destinations.  I won‚Äôt waste anymore time on this site. | 3 weeks ago I bought 3 return tickets with this application with the insurance of flexible date changing for the flight, and i paid 35$ for each insurance and at the time of selling the insurance for me, they were saying that all costs of the flight date changing will be only 135$ at anytime before departure. Since last 3 days i have been talked plenty of time with the customer service and they wasted too much time and at the end they ask me 940$ for the flight date changing even though they sold me the flexible flight date insurance. And their excuse is that insurance was not covering the fare and taxes, so what does an insurance means then? They scammed me so badly and they are just wasting the time. Please never ever trust on this app. Is not trustworthy specially for people in the USA. I have proofs and screenshots how they are scamming. I am super disappointed and sad. | Great app overall. | Professional, easy to use. Booking, trips under one tab. Easy navigation. | This app shows on price, but when you click on it, the price increases‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve done this on several different hotels and the price always increases.. don‚Äôt waste your time with this mess. | Your payment platform is the absolute worst I have ever encountered.  Doesn‚Äôt work half the time and gives a payment failed message the other half‚Ä¶no options to fix it!!! | Good luck if you have changing the plan and you need to change the flight they need six hours notice to change it
Try to claim a full ticket were not used
It cost me 1900 they offered $100 . | L·ª´a ƒë·∫£o chi·∫øm ƒëo·∫°t t√†i s·∫£n | Excellent app for travelers. | Ë≥áÊñôÊ∏ÖÊ•öÔºå‰ΩøÁî®Êñπ‰æø | They let hotels sort reviews such an order that they all decieve the clients. For instance i have stayed in mgm grand. The hotel had terrible guest service, lots of hidden cost, no working wireless etc. Me and other 2 guys have written very bad reviews. But guess what when i checked hotel reviews , the good old reviews were at the top but our newest reviews are listed below. I have asked them why they told me hotels are arranging that.

Hopefully it works well later. Thanks. A+ for one time user. | Good | My favorite service house! ********* | Last update broke searching. Sort by stars, scroll, everything resets and sort is broken. | Booked a hotel at ok rate.  Got an email the next day that there was an error w my credit card. No one reached out it was just cancelled and the room/rate is no longer available.  Contacted customer service which was slow and did nothing to help.  Use Expedia | That‚Äôs the long and short of it. I never have to worry about the price changing at checkout like AirBnB and VRBO. Depending on what state, city, or country you are looking in will greatly affect how many properties actually pop up when compared to some of the other apps. | This is a great app and great deals, much better than Booking.com.. | I don‚Äôt see my first time ten percent discount on my bill. Possibly just baiting. Decent price though. | I will never again use this app again, which is also tied to booking.com. Beware of false advertising of free hotel cancellation, which when you get confirmation in email show $47% -97% cancellation fee. Customer Service is poor and they can not even access the agoda app to help you. | User friendly great deals always! | Es excelente | Very nice to deal with this company and I like it they give you a rebate when you travel with them so I recommend this company to anybody that wants to travel a lot We have been many places and I think this is a good good good app. | Told me that I can book now and pay at
Hotel but charged my card. | If you need an immediate confirmation for flights, it takes 24 hours. They do not tell you this until after you pay. There is no refunds and no one to help you with customer service. They only contact you when you leave a bad review. I would recommend using another service as they will not be there in case you get into trouble. | Don‚Äôt get app it‚Äôs a scam | I‚Äôve had a ludicrous amount of trouble applying the credit Agoda gave me for defrauding me on an earlier cancelled booking. I really can‚Äôt recommend this app, as it took me 3 phone calls to resolve anyway. | The bests prices ever! ü§©ü§©ü§© | Bought a airline ticket and needed confirmation then and did not get it for 24 hours. In the mean time needed to show I had the ticket and so I had to use another site. Would not recommend. This app cost me a lot of money. No refunds and terrible customer service. They respond to negative feedback on reviews but have zero customer support. | Happens regularly | I am located in China and my app randomly switched to Chinese. Just because I am in this location doesn‚Äôt mean I want to use it in local language, its really annoying | Agoda is a scammer. We made 2 bookings through their app. One was made for a wrong date. So they needed to refund us for that night. Which is so difficult to do it with them for some reason. Also we got charge 3d time, which is a total for those 2 nights. Ao basically we got charged for 4 nights, instead of one. Qe have contacted the hotel where we stayed, the manager was a very nice lady, she said she will refund us if agoda calls her to confirm. Guess what, agoda says they contacted the property and they are not refunding us. Which is a lie. Avoid these scammers. Because I still can‚Äôt get my money back for weeks . P.S even with their reply on my review, the still lie and go around with no solution. Avoid this platform, I have never experienced such difficulty to get a refund for a service I didn‚Äôt use. | Grateful that I was a member of this company AGODA ,they helps my travels very easy to find new comfortable and cheap safe places to stay ,All the information in their site are useful, thank you so much, I'm happy booking with you! GOD BLESS | Sign in doesn‚Äôt work. Hasn‚Äôt worked for a year now. Get it together. | Booked a reservation for my siblings and went through smoothly!  Nice! | They only care about the hotel not the guest 
Even I sent them pictures the room was dirty with cockroaches and they didn't even solve the issue the funny they offered $5 when I paid more than $50. Even the $5 didn't pay me 
Non trust app | There‚Äôs no discount | Thank you for a lower price than others and for it being easy to book | Good | I mostly use this app to book hotels for option to save money. I tried booking flights for the first time through their app and transactions went smoothly. must have for travelers! | When searching for a Miami Airport hotel for an overnight layover , I listed ‚Äúairport shuttle‚Äù as one of my requirements.

Extended Suites America- Blue Lagoon was one of the resulting hotels.  The price was reasonable.  The Blue Lagoon was a nice area.  I chose it.

You cannot imagine my surprise when I arrived in the Hotel Shuttle pick-up area at the Miami airport, and called the hotel to let them know to contact the shuttle driver with my location - only to be told ‚ÄúThis property doesn‚Äôt have a shuttle.‚Äù
I had to take a taxi at a charge of $23.  I will have to do the same to get back to the airport tomorrow.

If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the property HAS NO ELEVATOR.  I had to walk up two flights of stairs carrying a heavy suitcase- twice!  There‚Äôs was no one to help!

Agoda clearly has not vetted this property properly and my level of disappointment in the company is indescribable.   Had I known that I was going to have to pay an additional $46 just to get to/from the property- or that it had no elevator- I would never have considered the place!

Shame on you, Agoda! | The worst booking experience ever. The service allowed me to book a hotel which didn‚Äôt have any rooms available to book. The reservation was pending and never confirmed which forced me to find another place to stay.

DON‚ÄôT TRUST THIS SCAM COMPANY! | Agoda is the best.

He stated he had another job  and could not complete the ride.  Driver left us off at a random gas station for us to find another solution to his mistake.

We were late arriving at a destination. This is totally unacceptable. How can this situation be rectified ? Please credit my account.

H | The driver was friendly and played great music. It was a nice ride. Thank you! | My driver- Steven- played awesome rocking music on our way to the airport giving me a nice boost to my day. Thanks Steven! | They lie about how long it will take for the driver to come so that you pick it over Lyft. If the driver is ‚Äú7 minutes away‚Äù and they come at 12 minutes. That‚Äôs over 50% off that‚Äôs intentionally misleading especially when it‚Äôs that off regularly. | Vance was fun to talk with on the way to our first stop. I wish we could‚Äôve hired him for the day. | Great experience using the App from USA & driver was a true professional. Thanks! | He is very knowledgeable and has a calm and kind manner. I highly recommend him. Is there a way to recommend him to others?
We had a lovely conversation on our drive. 
Wonderful man. | This morning we were delivered to the airport at 4 am by Dan. He was courteous, friendly and exactly on time. His car was very nice and immaculate. I would give him six stars if I could! | I‚Äôm tired of the wait time being short and then I get stuck waiting 20-25 mins. then when u get a driver they are far away like, how do u expect others to spend money when u can‚Äôt even get them to their destination. So their others being stuck at the airport or me being stuck at my job/ stranded . There have been plenty of times where I‚Äôve had to be constantly late to work because you guys have said one time and then I‚Äôm stuck waiting longer or a driver will wait till they get to the destination and then cancel and try to take money away like at this point they just want money. Also, if you‚Äôre planning to even drive someone , you might as well drive everybody. | Onan was an excellent driver | Kind, courteous and fast to respond. | Great car great gentleman excellent service | Prompt, helpful, friendly. Clean vehicle. | Michelle was very friendly and honest. I left my purse in the car and she accommodated us to get back my personal item back quickly. I highly recommend this Uber driver! | Abe was a great driver. He was very friendly and helpful and safe. | Jasmine is the best Uber driver I‚Äôve ever road with very cautious and careful driving and get you there on time I would recommend her to anyone thank you Uber for safe drivers!!! | Fabulous ride!  Thank you! | Dayvon is awesome.  Great service w a personal touch.  5 stars | Randy was a delight. | Amazing | Excellent driver ! Great conversationalist, car was clean and smelt really good !!! Highly recommended | Great guy and was very generous | Awesome driver and waited to make sure I was at the right place. | Such a polite driver. | Jose was pleasant with a nice smile. The car was clean. | Driver was friendly and helpful thx again üòâ | Larry was very prompt on his arrival. He was also very knowledgeable of the area. Very friendly. Thanks Larry | Need a refund | Marino was a great human being! And a safe driver! | Driver very courteous and was ahead of time. Thank you. | Thank you so much. We enjoyed the wonderful trip home from the airport. Thank you Galyna for a safe trip. God bless you. | Thanks for the great trip Cindy! | Great conversation and a very clean car! I felt safe and he was an excellent driver | Muy eficiente much√≠simas Gracias | The new rate your driver screen attempts to trick you into tipping more. After the controversies around safety, they approve this change. The used car salesperson of technology. Did you get bought by Oracle? With all your problems with various municipalities, why erode good will from your customers? Just unreal. | Chatty (in a good way)!  Good conversation, also stopped for a squirrel otw!  Thank you! | Good show up time. Good travel time A1. | The driver was on time and very nice. I would highly recommend him and use him every time I come to Vegas!! | Keep on rising prices even though there stock it‚Äôs at all time high. Greedy as people. | Why am I being charged booking fee? | Onur was an excellent driver‚Äîarrived within minutes, was friendly and welcoming, and got us home without any problems.  We certainly appreciate his service and tipped him with cash. We were impressed with Uber and will recommend the service to our friends.
Thank you! | The app said one price but now Uber is trying to charge me an additional $40 for the trip. Not sure what‚Äôs that about but it‚Äôs a scam, all fees should be established when it states the cost. | I paid for Uber one and when it came to booking a ride the fare said 0.00 dollars but now I‚Äôm being charged I noticed that there are glitches and two y‚Äôall be hiking the prices up like crazy in the mornings I‚Äôm paying a monthly fee and still be paying an crazy amount of money I stopped using Lyft cause I thought you guys were more fair when it came to pricing y‚Äôall services | Had a very nice early morning trip to the airport with Barbara, she is very sweet! Highly recommend her! | Great service very fast at last minute notice. Thanks, for all of your help. | It‚Äôs 7:00am, I tried to get a driver to drive me for a 10 minute drive. Uber estimated the cost would be around $15. I was waiting for the app to find me a driver but I waited about 20 minutes and the app still hadn‚Äôt found a driver. Because of this I cancelled the request and it notified me that I might not want to do that because if I try again the wait may take just as long. I still decided to hit cancel because I figured I could get someone I know to pick me up. After cancelling the same rides that would have costed $15 showed to be $30 now that I had cancelled waiting. I just think this is very shady of the company to punish their customer for their long wait time. They also didn‚Äôt even give a warning that this would happen from cancelling the Uber search. I should not have to pay DOUBLE for an Uber if your app is being slow. Ridiculous. | Great driver, on time very respectful . | This gentleman Juan was very efficient and an excellent driver, courteous and the car comfortable and clean. | Paris is such a joy , he came early morning with a kind smile and disposition. A great way to start the day, thank you Paris for being so kindhearted.

I usually keep my phone very dim and the Delta app never fails to blind me. Maybe one of your iOS developers can fix that? 

Also, don‚Äôt default to checking people in. Maybe ask if people want to check in if they‚Äôre within 24 hours of their flight. | If possible I only fly delta | App is great and easy to use. | Using the App is really easy | Poor customer service after being a diamond for five years. I‚Äôll be traveling with another airline from now on. Thank you for the wonderful service up until now.  I‚Äôve noticed the decline in the quality of service, so why pay more for less. | Siempre viajo en ella | Very easy to check in | When I purchased the ticket, it clearly stated that the fare includes one checked bag, one carry-on bag, and one personal item. When I attempted to check in online, it asked for a number of checked bags and is trying to charge me $30. Bait-and-switch or outright lying are never cool. | One of the most commendable aspects of the Delta app is its real-time notifications. These updates keep me informed about any changes to my flight status, gate information, and even baggage claim details. This level of communication is invaluable, especially in an environment as dynamic as an airport. | I fly regularly/exclusively with delta and love this app. It works for almost everything I need but I have to switch to website version delta.com for a couple of things. 1) adding return flight automatically to my calendar (first flight works great) 2) flexible days for flight searching 3) mobile view of Medallion status. You can‚Äôt expand the ‚Ä¶ so I have no idea what my future status is or what‚Äôs required to reach it. | Wouldn‚Äôt let me use my miles to pay for my bags‚Ä¶ looks like a glitch in the programming | Delta canceled my minor son‚Äôs ticket and forced me to buy his seat again so he could travel home with me. Totally unacceptable. | You are almost as bad as spirit. | It changed my date of birth with every scan. | Although the user interface on the app is tremendous and you can do legit anything you need to do on the app, it‚Äôs fatal flaw is that you get stuck with a loading progress bar that never seems to load on several pages. Often it seems to be at critical moments in the airport like when you need to pull up your ticket QR code to board the plane. | I spent much do my IT career in B to B and B to C eCommerce, and the Delta online experience is pathetic. | While checking in we realized a passport had expired. The message advised we could delete and update via the app. 

So we delete the old passport information and everything is wiped. Irritating to say the least but okay, renter the demographic data (name, DOB, sex, etc) it isn‚Äôt like that changes very often so just move it forward in edit mode with the passport number and expiration date to be filled in. 

Not the reason for knocking two stars off. Entering a date REQUIRES the use of the date picker. Okay, I am used to date pickers so no problem.  The date picker for birthday is a month by month swipe! So for every year of age you have to swipe 12 times. And, maybe if you hold down the right arrow it would start to scroll - nope, you have to hit it once per month.  That is hundreds of clicks! Do the math Delta and send the app to your UX team. | I need to go to delta.com to open the app | I just updated the app and it no longer lets me use Face ID to log in‚Ä¶ | I have never been charged for the 1st checked bag.  Now this Denver trip Delta wants to charge me for a 1st checked bag.  I‚Äôve been a member of skymiles since before Delta when it was Northwest, why charge now??? | All crew were very kind and helpful‚Ä¶ definitely will continue flying Delta! | This stinks. Won‚Äôt let me check in 2 nd passenger. Keeps coming back to myself. | You‚Äôve set the app up so that it‚Äôs constantly trying to upsell your customers but it‚Äôs next to impossible to pay for a checked bag. | This is a good airline to fly with, easy to book, hassle free, unlike the other competitors that are confusing and difficult to book with. | Mikelle turned an anxiety-ridden issue and, even though over text message, made me feel comfortable as the work was being performed,

Mannerly, kind and efficient.  Mikelle should be applauded for such heroic efforts! | ‚Ä¶a great user experience!  The app‚Äôs functionality keeps getting better and I find it to be one of the best apps that I use regularly! | Enough with the re loading itinerary. Slows app and freezes up. Make it where the user can choose to refresh by pull down. Not automatically do it! | No Apple Pay options for checked bags. No credit for Delta Amex usage for checked bags. | Rediculas | I‚Äôve been flying with Delta for a couple of years now. And I recommend this airline over most. | The app is continuously updating the itinerary even when no new information has been provided. It is very inconvenient. Other than that, I enjoy the app. But every time I open the app, it takes 2-3 minutes before I can see the ticket on the screen because of the updates. | I have yet to see an airline app that works well and has a good UI, and Delta is no exception. Horrid | A lot of issues these days. | This is the worst airline app. it constantly refreshes while I‚Äôm waiting for my boarding pass. I have to shut the app down and reopen it several times. It‚Äôs very unreliable. | Good Job thanks | Crappy | They are the best of all airlines, and I‚Äôve flown them all, at quality, making you feel safe in flight, the pilots, the flight attendants, everything about the Delta organization is truly high-level. There‚Äôs no doubt about them, being the best airline going!

And yes, I do enjoy the amazing Delta sky clubs on layovers! Mitch | Performance of the app has taken a sudden, unpleasant turn for the worse.  Updates, reloads, seat changes, etc. now stall the app or may throw errors during timeouts.  Something has gone badly wrong somewhere that needs to be fixed ! | I check my pet in in advance via the delta chat and then the app ceases to let me see my checkin details even after I check in at the gate

‚ÄúWe are unable to process your request. Please check in with an agent at the airport‚Äù

I‚Äôm forced to use a paper ticket every time. Ive missed that I‚Äôve been upgraded and had other boarding and security issues due to the app not working after checking in with my pet. 

This may be an ADA issue for people with service animals. | After being delayed in NYC, we finally landed at Orlando International Airport. Waiting at the carousel for our luggage, mine came out but my daughters which had most of our belongings, had been loaded on another plane at JFK. With everything left in NYC, we had to purchase items to get us through the night. $150 later, we called the airport the next day to get an update. We received an update at 10:50 am that the luggage had finally arrived and was waiting at the carousel to be picked up by the delivery service to bring to us. We were told that we should have it about 12 noon. By 8pm the luggage status page still indicated that my daughter‚Äôs luggage was STILL at the carousel. We decided to go and get the luggage ourselves. As we entered the terminal there the suitcase sat still waiting to be delivered. This was to be my daughter‚Äôs 21st birthday celebration. $110 in uber cost, $150 for necessities to get us through the 1st 2 days of our 5 day trip, and $50 apple air tag purchase!! What a waste! I won‚Äôt say that I would never fly Delta again but this lost baggage policy needs to be reviewed, and streamline to a better process! | Processes redundant you keep entering information over and over in a loop | Charged to pick a seat $$, charged 70‚Ç¨ per bag on international flight from Europe to U.S.  Will never fly Delta again! | I‚Äôve refreshed and reinstalled and logged out. Still glitches often.

Update: still glitches and takes dial up speed time to refresh. | The app is great and has great features but still has a few bugs to work out.  It hangs up while it‚Äôs updating, sometimes while you wait for luggage your reservation isn‚Äôt on Today any longer and when you need to search for a lost bag it is an ordeal at that point.  The slow refreshing itinerary is annoying as it freezes up constantly. | Knock on wood perhaps‚Ä¶all of the war stories from travelers about bumping and cancellations and lost luggage ‚Ä¶.not ever my experience with Delta. And any issues there have been have been quickly resolved.

Wish we were a hub but I have learned to co sider ATL and Detroit as my ‚Äúextended base‚Äù for all flights | I‚Äôve had low memory errors on and off for many years. The app works fine when it does work though. | The app is constantly in an unusable state blocked by a full screen modal with ‚ÄúUpdating itinerary‚Ä¶‚Äù even if I am not looking at a trip. Its super frustrating to see this pop up for 30-60 seconds upon every app open (and multiple times after) especially when I‚Äôm trying to actively scan a boarding ticket or voucher.

Update: since writing this review this has seemingly gotten worse. I can leave the app open forever and my boarding pass is just covered by the ‚ÄúRefreshing itinerary‚Ä¶‚Äù modal. The app is quite literally unusable for me for looking at or managing my trip. Closing and reopening the app does nothing the modal is still permanently there. | App is hard to navigate   United‚Äôs is much better. | Delta is definitely second to none!!!
I have never traveled with other carrier that 
Gives the service that Delta offers. | The app no longer allows write-only calendar integration on iOS, despite the presence of the option in settings.

Fortunately there is only a 40 minute wait via their customer service line | Thank you to the crew - Susan, Renee, Ann, JC, Walter, Stacy and the rest of the crew. They were professional, helpful, kind and caring.  Excellent flight.  Thank you. | What an embarrassment for a mature airline to perform in amateur status.
From gate and terminal changes to delays in maintenance and then catering from one plane to the next has been over 1:39 hrs without a response according to the captain.
The frustration on the captains voice and the embarrassing details he has had to relay over intercom are of an incompetent airlines team members.
No response?????
They can‚Äôt get any answers 
I now have missed a flight connecting international on a trip scheduled where I‚Äôm losing money on hotel, car service, activities that were already reserve.

I need some kind of compensation for my time and days wasted because of AA. | So happy i joined the AA advantage looking forward to my next trip | Safe and comfortable flight with friendly attendants. | I used to love this app. For many months now, every time I try to book a reward flight, I receive a message that says an error occurred and to try later. Many, many times I have reached out to American Airlines and been told nothing is wrong with the app. I have deleted the app and reinstalled it multiple times. Nothing works. I now can‚Äôt book any award flights through this app. and they refuse to do anything about it. | Thanks for swapping my seat since you can‚Äôt manage flights. Also why does your employee think I can‚Äôt take my bag after showing it‚Äôs mine | Smooth flight arrived early and got my luggage. Everything went perfectly! | Wonky...have to check in for both legs of the flight (vs one time for just the flight).  Boarding passes in apple wallet don't auto update when you change/upgrade your flight.  They need to study the Delta app which is much better. | But then I‚Äôm usually flying Alaska Air and American‚Äôs app is nowhere near as well thought out as Alaska‚Äôs. Also my American digital boarding passes do NOT have the date on their face! It‚Äôs hidden under the info button. Very odd. And TSA has made me print paper boarding passes twice now. Dumb! Fix it American, please. | Just another screwup courtesy of AA | They are the worst airline out there. It‚Äôs countless delays. They had us board a 8:35 pm plane then told us after we boarded that the plane was just towed over here for a maintenance issue. Turns out a hydraulic needed replacement and it would take an hour. This was at 9pm. So we‚Äôve been delayed a hour and a half sitting in a plane like a sardine in a can with no airflow and stinky people.  

They don‚Äôt care. & have no accommodation for there passengers. They will never receive my money again.! | Flew first class as a treat for my birthday. Everything nice until I could not find my bag at baggage claim. Checked at Service Department and told it was on a different plane that would not arrive for an hour. I am writing this review as I wait. Not happy American. | It gives the directions inside of the airport as well as bag tracking and flight status easily retrieve mobile boarding passes very convenient!! | Delayed repeatedly then cancelled flight. Then after rebooking didn‚Äôt move my bags and tgey are days late and now will not deliver to my home. | American is a good priced airline that takes good care of you when things do not go perfect everywhere, but DFW. They are the worst at DFW. | This app does not allow you to do anything. | This app was working flawlessly until today. I went in the App Store and saw that it needed an update so I updated the app and it is still frozen when I click on my flight. I tried restarting my and phone and still nothing changed. Please update the app again to fix this issue. Once app is fixed I will give it a 5star review | Since you know everything else about me, why don‚Äôt you link the bags to my account when I check them in and then maybe tell them we‚Äôre gonna unload them and then when I get to DFW? | They are never on time and they are a horrible choice. | Great app. I use it with ease and to great effect. However, there is this notion that it can be used for the inflight entertainment. On my iPhone the APP simply displays a message to change settings and then it‚Äôs the browser, which is kind of klunky. It does not work ‚Äúthrough the app‚Äù. | Why is it so hard to get miles credited to my account? | Worst customer service. Took 3 days to get home after a cancelled flight and was repeatedly lied and mistreated by ground staff. Will do everything in my power to never fly American Airlines again. | Why is it so hard to buy baggage online? They don‚Äôt make it clear how to when checking in. You also can‚Äôt select it anywhere on the app or website after checking in???? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. | Very hard to do anything in this app

Even getting a receipt is hard. You can‚Äôt print or export to PDF or anything from the app

Awful. And a reason I use AA less than I could otherwise | Any time they have issues with delays there app slows down even more and makes it so hard to manage your flights. | The app doesn‚Äôt let me standby for an earlier flight if my trip has stops, even if I am an AAdvantage member. It only allows me to do it if it‚Äôs a nonstop flight | This app is so glitchy, whether I‚Äôm trying to check in, or just trying to look at my boarding pass, it glitches so much! I | Had no issues prior, and paid a bit extra for this flight, but it would not allow me to check in on the mobile app or the website. What an absolute waste of time. | I am exec platinum pro and for the first time ever decided to check a bag to Burbank. One hour flight. My bag didn‚Äôt make it even though I was 1.5 hours early checking in. My husband‚Äôs did. This is unacceptable. Why should I show loyalty to you when you can‚Äôt get my bag here? I‚Äôm leaving for a cruise out of Long Beach tomorrow and don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôll have my bag. I‚Äôm so disappointed. | Can‚Äôt this app find my flight reservation??  Logging in to aa.com finds it immediately but this stupid app can‚Äôt find it!! | For an upcoming flight, AA refuses to let me check in online unless I use some third-party app called Verifly. Naively, I downloaded this app and provided copious personal information, including a photo and other identifying info.

Verifly then asked me to locate my flight manually and then asked me to simply check a box verifying that I had filled out necessary travel documents. What a joke! The kicker is that every single person in the party has to do this before AA will let you check in online.

This shows a flagrant disregard for the personal privacy of travelers, forcing us to send our personal data to a third party just to use a basic app function. No other airline app has ever asked for this, even for international flights to countries with entry requirements.

I would not be surprised if this was simply a scam to harvest user data and sell it for profit. As someone who cares about my online privacy I am floored by AA‚Äôs blatantly scummy practices. I‚Äôd rather fly United Economy 100 times than deal with this. | Always cancels my flight | I sat at the Charlotte airport trying to get assistance for over 2 hours trying to get on a waitlist for an earlier flight. I spoke with 3 different people at the airport that stated any waitlist has to be done on the app. I repeatedly attempted to do this on the app with no assistance from either of the people I asked. I even called the 800 number and they told me they couldn‚Äôt help me. There was 2 other people trying to do the same thing and the app would not allow them to get on the waitlist as well. This was the worst customer service experience I have ever had. Janelle was the persons name at Airline Assist & Dana was who I spoke with on the 800 number. I would never recommend American Airlines. Worst customer service experience ever! | So easy to use when I‚Äôm traveling. So glad it keeps me notified | I fly American every week. Flight attendants make up their own ‚ÄúAmerican Air‚Äù policies based upon their own biases. Some crews are reasonable, while others impose their own rules based upon their own random bad attitudes. | I have been asking to speak to a supervisor on the phone, not via email, for over a month! My grandfather passed so we had to change our flight tickets. We are AAadvantage members. I was able to get flight credits to reschedule my flight to go to my grandfathers funeral. When we attempted to do the same for my husbands flight we kept having issues with the website and we didn‚Äôt want to mess up anything so we called AA for support. An AA employee cancels his flight and said the flight credits will be in his AA account with in the hour so if any other issues occur , call back. We rescheduled his flight using the flight credits but when we attempted to check out it said ‚Äúthese flight credits are unavailable to use online ‚Äú ??? Called AA again. Spoke to a very rude woman who said I needed to email a supervisor because ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt take phone calls‚Äù. After asking her multiple times to look at the credits / our AA advantage membership accounts she stated she doesn‚Äôt have authorization to do so. Now the credits are mysteriously gone. 

Due to multiple employee errors & false policy reassurance, we were unable to get flight credits to change my husbands flight. So we had to spend an additional $900 to buy him another flight to make it to my grandfathers funeral.
I have spoke with / emailed multiple AA employees who always transfer me off to someone else or say there is nothing they can do. I finally emailed someone who said I would be refunded the flight back to my credit card and just needed to fill out the form through AA refund support. AA refund support denied it!! 

I have asked for AA to pull all my recorded phone conversation, emails,  my AAadvantage account information and my husbands in order to prove this was an employee error and that this needs to be fixed! 

I have spoke with an attorney regarding this. 

Still waiting for a phone call from an AA supervisor !!!!!

Writing to customer relations does nothing!!! | Upon completion of a trip using the app, the trip disappears from the app. I have to request mileage credit via the main website. What‚Äôs the point of the app?!? | I love the notion of an app that keeps me informed about my AA flights, but this app is apparently not updated to match the airline‚Äôs frequent flight changes‚Äîso it is not only useless, but it can potentially cause missed flights when flight times are changed, but passengers are not informed. | I'm someone who flies American Airlines all the time for work. I've got the timing from the parking garage, security checkpoints, or Admirals Lounge at most major American hubs down to a science. While this app is good and gives you most of what you need out of an airline app, it would be a game changer if someone just added the ability to show when your plane is boarding - either in the screen that shows you the details of your flight and whether it is ""On time"" or ""Delayed"" and/or with a pop-up notification on your phone (instead of having to ask an agent or look at one of the airport screens), especially when there are the usual delays and I could continue to work out of the lounge a bit longer. | Knowing that our flight kept getting delayed Vegas to Chicago, I called American to see what could be done with bags if we missed connecting flight(last flight for the night) 
I explained that we rented a car and could we get our bags in Chicago?  Of course nothing they could do and to check with gate agent when we get in. American knew that 6 people from our flight needed to get to a quick connection in Chicago. 
There was no one at arrival gate, no cart to get us to the next flight. After running, we missed the flight by three minutes! 
So plan B to the rental car but first we needed our bags. At baggage claim we were told it would be an hour. Even though bags from our flight showed up in 15 minutes. All but bags tagged for a connection. After one hour two of three bags arrived. Now I‚Äôm angry because we have to drive two hours.
What makes me the most angry is the completely blank faces of the office personnel who just said wait. No assistance and no responsibility. Getting to the time that rental car office would close and still no bag, no help, no apology and certainly no advice. 
After devolving into pure internal rage I asked them to find my bag and put it on the first flight in the morning.
I‚Äôm a credit card holder and frequent flyer. I will do anything in the future to find a different air carrier. Guess what I have also discontinued use of my AA credit card. I will file for refund on flight that was missed, curious how long and how much red tape this will take.
Hey American, I wouldn‚Äôt be so irritated if just one of your employees apologized or offered to help. | Flight was on time both ways. The service was fantastic. The plane was clean, so was the bathrooms my wife and I enjoyed the trip very much. | I retired as an American Captain and Check Pilot last May. My wife and I travel often. Most of the time we buy tickets because it is so difficult to Non Rev. We were coming home today from Boise to Phoenix after attending a friend‚Äôs Military Sons funeral on a full fare ticket with a Business Upgrade. We arrived early in Phoenix and tried to get on an earlier flight 3980 to Tucson. We went to the gate and the Agent never greeted us but said‚Äùwe don‚Äôt have any seats ‚Äú. Very unprofessional. I would say as a whole since I retired, the gate agents are very unfriendly at American Airlines. I realize that they have a difficult job but being friendly doesn‚Äôt cost anything! | Let‚Äôs just ignore the group 9 boarding.. I don‚Äôt understand how you think it‚Äôs normal to board people who are seated literally in the middle of the plane, dead last. But whatever‚Ä¶ and I paid EXTRA for those seats. 

The worst part was the woman sitting next to me who not only lacked hygiene, but also personal space. She smelled like stale alcohol, urine and terrible body odor AND was also spread out like a star fish for the majority of the flight. I will never fly American again. | I pay a lot of money for status, had a 3 hour layover in Charlotte and have priority. Why is my bag not on the plane with me.  This is unacceptable and I feel as though I am being ripped off. Absolutely ridiculous. | Flights were fine but only 1 of my 2 baggage arrived. Very inconvenient and disappointing! | Not sure easy to use or understand. Asks for too much information just to look at your flight. | 2nd time they have lost my luggage | Love the app in general, but I‚Äôm just wondering what happened to the flight tracker capability? I used to use that option ALL the time to watch loved ones flight status and see where they were while en route, and now I can‚Äôt find that function and I really miss it.

It‚Äôs conflicting with my internet security software (Norton) and won‚Äôt work. Only app that has a problem, terrible design. | Despite the numerous reviews about this issue, the Bonvoy App still does not work with VPN. Hello, if you‚Äôre traveling, you may be using VPN.  Why doesn‚Äôt Marriott get this?  It‚Äôs the only App I have that doesn‚Äôt work with VPN, which is a huge disincentive to using the App. | About 6 years ago I joined the Marriott bonvoy program while taking our basketball teams to tournament in Southern California. I saw the brochure on the table to signed up. Since then we‚Äôve been able to earn hundred of thousands of points and a lifetime of memories traveling around the world including our wedding in Iceland. We‚Äôve booked every trip with our app and it‚Äôs been so easy to use. | Love the App but wish it would quit logging me out..then I have to search for my bonvoy # and passwords! I screenshot my bonvoy # because it happens so often üò° | Anamica and Melody services were excellent during my stays.
Services were good
Room services were good
Front desk representative were very cooperative.
Overall services - Excellent | It took me over a decade to hit their platinum elite for life‚Ä¶but what‚Äôs the point? I‚Äôm consistently feel like it was an immense waste of time and money.  Now I‚Äôm either stuck with poor hotel,  
Or just start all over at the bottom with a new hotel chain.  I recommend that you seek a different hotel brand.  Marriott is not worth it. | As an app developer this app is perfect. It‚Äôs responsive, easy to use, feature rich. I also travel for an aviation company and I prefer Marriott over all other hotels. 10/10 would recommend. | The hotel isn‚Äôt bad and it‚Äôs on the river.  A great spot, but there is no food served during a busy night.  We wish we would have known in advance, we would have stayed elsewhere.  She told us we could walk to get food, but it‚Äôs packed downtown.  We love Marriott properties, but will go back to Tampa Water Street. | So easy to use.  Book trips with ease.  Easy to cancel if you have to as well. | The beds are not comfortable at all. | Always asking to turn on notifications which is super annoying. It asks literally everytime I open the app. | My wife and I love staying at the Fairfield in Marathon! Walking distance from Island Fish Company and Sparky‚Äôs, there‚Äôs a marina onsite, trailer parking for your boat, awesome views and very friendly staff. Highly recommend! | Marriott really pushes the use of their app. I‚Äôm not a frequent customer, but on my last 2 stays I used it to manage my reservation and it didn‚Äôt do much. I ‚Äòchecked in‚Äô remotely when prompted, but it made no difference on arrival. I still had to go to the desk, show my ID, swipe my credit card (which is stored in the app) and pick up a plastic key (even though I signed up for the electronic key on my phone). I don‚Äôt understand what purpose the app check-in serves. For making a reservation maybe it saves a step or two from going to the website but not convinced. And the e-key feature using your phone has never worked for me, even after checking in at the desk. So eh, don‚Äôt really find it very helpful. | Anove | This app does everything seamlessly.  I can shop for rooms, read reviews, select hotels, request special needs, check in and check out.  AND it can serve as my room key.  This app is close to perfect. | A hotel in Europe was booked on line at a very good rate for a layover from the airport , and somehow it got booked as a very expensive Marriott member non-refundable rate . Our emails were not working at the time so I was not able to see the confirmation. I would not see that charged on my Marriott card because it was to be paid at check-in. We are traveling with friends and had committed to the price for a cheaper hotel . This one would have been twice the cost . Fortunately, I was able to call the hotel and they were willing to cancel this reservation since we are platinum elite members since 2008. We are so very appreciative that they were willing to cancel at no additional cost . Thank you Marriott . 
PRabideau | Love this app | Even when you check the box to disable the latest news and updates, IT STILL POPS UP when you open the app each time!! These companies need to stop spamming their users on a constant basis! | The web site does a very good job of making it difficult to call customer service | next time | Please remove the annoying Get Notified pop up that continues to pop up after being dismissed. Used to be able to filter reviews by elite status which gave a more useful/relevant review than the non members. | I use Bonvoy (Marriott) App frequently to book for my business trip. It always find me a hotel and room that I can rest in and enjoy. I find it very intuitive and functional and I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially those with status. | I love how easy it is I can book within three or four taps | Easy to use!!! | Easy to use and the mobile key is so convenient | First of all checking in was fun since the app didn‚Äôt work. When I asked how to use the mobile key I was told I don‚Äôt know I just work here. There was absolutely no water pressure, the shower was disgusting with mold in the corners, all ice machines were down, we had no phone in our room and then we were woke up at 6 am to landscapers working with blowers and weed eaters right outside our 1st story window. When I went to the desk to ask about this I was laughed at by the woman at the front desk. Her name was Ingrid and she has the worst customer service attitude ever. I asked who I could complain to since she didn‚Äôt want to here it and she said no one and then as I turned around she starts singing the song playing in the lobby at the top of her lungs and laughing again. This has been an awful experience and I will never stay here again. And Ingrid needs to find a job where she doesn‚Äôt deal with the public | I just requested the last night a lunch box to go but it wasn‚Äôt ready !!!! The rest is a good hotel | Web proxy error and the app no longer works. | I am lifetime titanium platinum. The app is always down when I need it. You can‚Äôt add people to the reservation. I have found better posted rates.

The app seriously makes me consider a move to Hilton or Hyatt. I would consider this especially if I was starting out my career. | You should be able to clear search history. Chat service is there for cosmetic reasons. Staff never responds! Developers responded to search history inquiry and said delete app and reinstall. Lame excuse for half baked app.  Mobile key is a gimmick.   Never works | Love the discounts | The Bonvoy App used to be the best hotel app.  It‚Äôs Explore feature allowed an easy and elegant map-based exploring service.  The new system is horrible.  Allow me to suggest that a new update allow users to choose the old elegant Explore system or the new less-friendly and more restrictive system. | Every time I try to open the app it says I have an internet security issue and closes. Does it on my iPhone and iPad, connecting to wireless or cellular. | This app made me turn on notifications every time I log on, it‚Äôs extremely frustrating and stupid. I‚Äôm a Titanium/Platinum member as I travel a lot (fun and work) and considering to leave because of this annoyance | This app works great on my iPhone. However it is useless on my Apple Watch. I try to use the mobile key on Apple Watch and the Apple Watch keeps opening my main credit card and tries to open my room door with that instead of the key. Maybe it‚Äôs an Apple Watch thing, maybe it‚Äôs a Bonvoy thing; doesn‚Äôt matter‚Ä¶it simply doesn‚Äôt work.

Make Apple Watch use the mobile key when I select it and maybe I‚Äôll download it again. For now, deleted. | I love my Marriott app and use it almost daily for business and personal bookings. My favorite feature was the flexible date calendar feature, allowing you to input suggested dates and shop around the entire month of pricing for a specific hotel. This helped me plan many trips over the years. Seemingly overnight, that feature now does not work (and has not been restored in 3+ updates since). I can still use it if I put in for AAA/Special pricing but not for standard pricing, it just shows an - through the price. Seems to be an easy bug to fix? Yet it hasn‚Äôt been. I saw a few other recent reviews addressing this. 

Arguably better to use than their website though! | Every single time the app opens it not only takes FOREVER to open and then every single time it prompts for notifications.
It‚Äôs so slow that I‚Äôve started only using physical cards. | We love using the Marriott Bonvoy App. The perks are way better then having ownership with Marriott. We are timeshare owners and we receive more perks on this app when booking rooms then as timeshare owners! As timeshare owners there is never availability when we want to book on our resort site. We always have to book on the Marriott Bonvoy App as a back up plan! I will always recommend anyone making a Marriott Bonvoy account and earn points on the app. Weather it‚Äôs booking, joining sweepstakes or promotions etc anything to receive points, The perks are always better and a room is always available on the Marriott Bonvoy app. | I closed all my CC‚Äôs , except this card! It is the best! I love travel, so this is the perfect card for me! | On my most recent staycation I chose to inquire a room at the Marriott and I‚Äôd have to say the quaint, yet elegant atmosphere from the lobby to the room made me feel calm and serene even in a busy hotel such as this establishment. I was greeted with friendly faces and catered to beyond my belief. I regret not becoming a member of the Marriott sooner ! | Will you all be fixing the issue of the app
Not working on iPhone? üòü it used to and I love it! | Playa Conchal, Pura Vita!
Lovely staff and amazing property. Looking forward to next visit!
Thank you | Every single time you open the app ‚Äî even five minutes apart ‚Äî you are inundated with pop ups asking you to turn notifications on. There is no way to get rid of these pop ups. Possibly the worst corporate app on the App Store. | This app has not worked on my iPhone or iPad for months. I have tried the various recommendations from Marriott‚Äôs support site and still no success. Frustrating as it is a great app when it works. | The Bonvoy App has been inoperative for the past several months due to ‚Äúweb proxy‚Äù error. I‚Äôve spent hours on hold with tech support. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on it.‚Äù I had hoped to get Platinum status this year, but I first need a functioning Bonvoy app. PS: I‚Äôm having no issues at all with Hilton and Hyatt apps. Your call, Marriott‚Ä¶ | After a long day on the road with difficult weather conditions, we checked into the Marriott, Courtyard Cranberry South Brunswick. There was an administrative issue at check-in, but because Beverly was kind, helpful and very knowledgeable, the issue was cleared immediately.  She is a great representative of a Marriott employee.  I was very grateful for her assistance. | Marriott Tacoma Downtown was Blissful. Service was amazing. Atmosphere was very chill and Serene. The bed was like sleeping on clouds and the staff was very friendly. If I could give 6 starts I would! | Mobile key is not working. | Fire the team that made the most recent version of this app. I‚Äôm very seriously considering moving to Hyatt because it‚Äôs so terrible. 
Asks for notifications every time 
Impossible to cancel reservations

They will list one price but once you click on it - the price doubles (at least). I‚Äôve spent HOURS looking and every single offer does this. The real kicker is there is no way to cancel the free trial, so I paid $40 to view click-bait. | Travelzoo is an awesome site to get bargains for travel it never disappoints | This app and it‚Äôs notifications have saved me time and money.   People are still clueless and afraid of using TravalZoo.  Don‚Äôt be.  The deals are real folks.  Don‚Äôt wait. | My favorite travel site, I see no reason to look anywhere else. | It show 400$ when you click on it, price jump to 1200$!! | We have used TravelZoo multiple times to go on different Vacations. Very happy with our Trips. There‚Äôs no telling how much we saved. This is a great way to see the world! | Love the app | When starting to brainstorm travel, just remember it‚Äôs now ok that it‚Äôs a ZOO at Airports. It‚Äôs simply Travel Zoo!! Knowledge is potential power. Saving thousands on a trip is true power, ACTION!! Thanks Zoo!!!!! | I‚Äôve been on many Travelzoo trips. They are always high quality, low, cost, and safe. I wait every Wednesday for my next update on the deals. Thanks for being such a great resource. DLW. | There‚Äôs never anything that lives out from my airport, so it‚Äôs pointless for me | Without landscape support, this app is useless to me. That‚Äôs sad, because I love Travelzoo! | The deals on this site and the customer service is great. Never less than par. | love the things to do and activities in my state of california | Booked several vacations thru Travelzoo.com and have never been disappointed! | I love receiving my weekly notification about travel deals. I enjoy traveling & getting good deals. Travelzoo provides me with what I need on a variety of travel destinations! | Always on top of the best deals offered.  Thanks | Been using the site a while Did Phl Argentina $600 plus tax 6 nites thru marnella

Plenty offers at everyone‚Äôs price | Very few offers with longer stays | Best prices you can find and simple to navigate through app | Won‚Äôt let me book. Keyboard gets stuck. | My wife got a great deal on a hotel in Asheville with all her tippler fruends. | Did a ski trip through Travelzoo and the place was great
Place awesome
Looking forward to more trips | Prefer the website. The App is too crowded and stuff not accurate. Kimpton deal in LA continues to cram back in the amenities fees that supposed to be waived. Tapping another path took me to Google and other suggested logins. Then it cannot because Google doesn‚Äôt it considered secure. App and paths would benefit from much better testing. No clean way get in app help or questions things. Just a slightly over engineered app that needs some additional testing. Back to web. | I have used Travelzoo for over ten years and it is always my first app to search for travel deals. Ten years ago my husband and I celebrated our 25th anniversary and had blocked out 3 weeks in May for the trip. I scoured Travelzoo for months and was able to grab an incredible trip to Australia with flights included from U.S. and 2 flights in country plus 12 nights of great hotels the first week of May. My husband was nervous about not booking earlier but I knew that Travelzoo would come through! Have booked many great spa days in Chicago and excellent dinners on the App. Never been disappointed by the quality of the experience or the value that Travelzoo offered. Planning a 35th anniversary trip this May and know that Travelzoo will come up with an amazing trip deal for us. | Love Travel Zoo!! Never have been let down!! | I have been using travel zoo for years! I tell everyone about it!! We have traveled to places like London, a 3 week tour in Vietnam, hotels & spa packages in Vail, Colorado and a Caribbean cruise to name a few. All our trips were Amazing and great deals! 
I look forward to the top 20 deals coming out every Wednesday!! | What a dump. Shame on you Travelzoo for promoting this dump. Shower did not have hot water, nor did it drain properly, room heater was loose and never heated the room warm enough even though thermostat was on hottest setting- 85 degrees. Bathroom sink was hot and cold were reversed. Bathroom was incredibly cramped. For Travelzoo to promote this, I now don‚Äôt trust your website. | Highly recommend it app if traveling at a discount is your goal. | I‚Äôm a long time user of Travelzoo. I enjoy the easy to navigate app. Chootie88 | I‚Äôve been checking TravelZoo for several years for travel bargains. Many, many people I know ask where I get my info and good travel deals. 
I always say Sign up for TravelZoo. It‚Äôs the best resource for reasonable and good travel locations. | Travelzoo has allowed my husband and my self to travel 2 times a year due to lower prices üòÅ.

We have been using travelzoo for over 15 years, at least twice a year! I can hardly wait till the new trips come out on Wednesdays! Great way to travel the world for very reasonable prices! | Great app | It's very helpful to find a dream vacation . | I have been using Travel Zoo for a few. Years now. The deals that they offer are fabulous. I have told so many people to check out this wonderful site. We are now retired, but for many years we were a family of five. Sometimes living from paycheck to paycheck. We definitely took advantage of some very affordable vacations. I also just love looking on the site to get ideas, or to just dream! | Cellular data is turned off for Travelzoo | Travel zoo was once a decent app. Now it‚Äôs a lot of third-party shenanigans. Not sold on it. I‚Äôll do my own research thanks! | I love travelzoo they always have the best deals at the cheapest prices, no scams no telemarketers just good honest deals for people who love to travel | Because of Travel Zoo I have traveled to places I never thought were possible. | Travelzoo has the best deals the best aventures and the best dreams! | My name Is Jose Rivera from Puerto Rico, Thanks to your reliable and excellent offers I have known many places in the world since I discovered them 4 years ago.!! Thank you travelzoo | Most people love packages that include air. People worry they won‚Äôt find a good air rate.  Please show more air-inclusive packages and tours, as you used to do. | I‚Äôm happy to be able to access this application to find great deals for travel. We are always satisfied! | I love Travelzoo! So many wonderful travel and food options. Can‚Äôt wait to go on my next trip to Costa Rica. | Selected the wrong language and don‚Äôt know how to change to English | Since my wife and I found travelzoo we have taken advantage of several trips. We have experience places we never dreamed of at great rates. I look at the top twenty almost every week just to see what might pop up. Never had a bad experience with their deals. Love it. | Thank you Travelzoo, I have received several great deals using your service over the years, from airfares and hotels, car rentals, restaurants, and various places of interest. The information you provide has been invaluable, and I thank you! | Looking for any travel needs- Travelzoo is the place to find it !! We love it!! | Great deals.

It doesn‚Äôt save me. | Went to book a room and afterwards was told it was a smoking room. No refund even though I purchased their worthless insurance. Stuck | I hate your app | You try to make your password when you try to get in it tells you you cannot get in until after 15 minutes that‚Äôs really awful. | Love the app for the most part with regard to ease of use, finding flights, etc. ~ big frustration is finding the perfect flights and price, then they increase significantly at check out. My only complaint, but its a huge problem. Would love to be able to trust the process. Thanks ~ | I booked a room for a over seas trip and needed to add another person to the reservation. After several attempts through the app I was unable to update my booking. A full 56 days before the trip I contacted an agent online only to be told that the couldn‚Äôt get ahold of the hotel, that the only way to upgrade my reservation was to cancel it and rebook or find another place. So I cancelled, the reservation clearly stated that I could cancel the reservation up to a week before with no problem. I then received an email saying that I would have to pay a cancellation fee because the reservation was cancelled to late for a full refund. I purchased trip insurance and then found out that it wasn‚Äôt refunded and was cancelled so no refund at all! I will not use this app again. | My flight and hotel was booked through Travelocity and my flight was cancelled and I tried calling to get refunded my money from the hotel. I spoke to 2 different people and they both hung up on my face with no help at all my fianc√©e had just lost his son and they didn‚Äôt even take that into consideration at all. The customer service from both the representatives from Travelocity were very unprofessional and rude by continuously hanging up in my face. I will never book with this hotel nor Travelocity again!!!!üò° Spirit gave me my money back but the hotel would not refund my money‚Ä¶.!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!! | I made through Travelocity.. landed.. waited for Thrifty transport van to pick me up. Showed the van  driver my reservation on  my phone. 
He says.. we  don‚Äôt have  your reservation AND.. we have 0 cars.
.. so.. here I‚Äôm standing in a foreign country without a car. The nice man monitoring the parking at the airport hooked me up with a local company.  
Just think .. if they had no cars!! I had 80 minute drive to my destination. I‚Äôll Never hook again on your website. I travel  frequently.. so this was the first experience of no reservation when I could prove I had  one.
Get your act together‚Ä¶ I hear this is not uncommon of your website. 
Might want to fix it b4 you lose more users.. | I made this reservation in January when I first knew of the wedding this weekend.  From the pictures, your place seemed perfect for my husband and me!!! However, when my husband came check in, he found that we were to be on  the  3rd floor! He has had 2 recent knee replacements and is having heart surgery soon!! There is NO WAY that he could have navigated that during our weekend in Charleston!!! Please refund the $715 to me asap. | I worked with an agent named Rome today with an issue and she was so helpful I wanted to make sure she got the praise she deserved. This is not the first time I‚Äôve received help from Travelocity - wonderful customer service üëçüòÄ | Dates do not correspond to actual calendar! | The website doesn‚Äôt recognize me as a person. I ca t figure out your puzzle, the arrow does nothing. I have an existing itinerary that I can‚Äôt access | Granted, I just installed the app on my iPad, a little bit difficult to navigate, I can‚Äôt find the most important thing which is the itinerary, which I just booked 10 minutes ago. I‚Äôll close this and go back in and why do I see Expedia at the bottom of a page when this is Travelocity.? thanks I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get it. It‚Äôs just you should see a link to my itinerary right on the homepage of Travelocity when you login. Thanks. | I have used Travelocity for years and have been extremely pleased with the help and services they provide. I give them a five star rating. | I have spent over an hour attempting to report a fraudulent charge made on my credit card by another one of your customers.  It was impossible to get onto contact with any human being to discuss this allegation.  The email I sent to the one provided to me by the help desk was kicked back to me as ‚Äúundeliverable‚Äù.  I refuse to do any future business with your agency going forward.  I do not associate with companies who fail to practice solid/transparent business practices. | See above! üòÉ | I only speak & read in English! The app downloaded was in Spanish | I have version 2024.7 on my ipad. It only allows flight sorting by number of stops.  My iPhone has an earlier version and allows sort by duration. Why would they disable this feature?  Bad!! | If you can‚Äôt login, you can‚Äôt use it. Keeps telling me to double check, which I meticulously have. But no dice. | Luggage seat choice not included you don‚Äôt care about my comfort | Check in and the Hotel were very good. The staff was promo and helpful. Travelocity on the other hand gets less than One Star. They were awful   I paid for my room through Travelocity , however Hyatt place had no record of that so I had to pay again. I‚Äôll NEVER use Travelocity again. They‚Äôre awful and heaven forbid you have to talk to a human. Even that is difficult | Loved it! | I love staying at the Lord Nelson! So much history and great location. The rooms are cute! | I clearly checked the box for English language | T  TV c saw | You keep sending me information about bookings in Nairobi! I mean LOTS of them ! Daily. And I never searched Nairobi, nor do I have any desire to go there! Please STOP!üõë | Dollar Rental didn't have a car for me that I rented through Travelocity. Dollar couldn't cancel and no easy way to cancel through Travelocity | Very clean, made you feel like you were checking into your home! Have stayed here before and will stay here again!! | I booked a flight to Puerto Rico a few months ago on Jet Blue. Thought I got a good deal when I went to get my ticket the kiosk computer requested $80 extra dollars for the cheapest seat. When I purchased my ticket I thought it was for a seat on the plain. Scam. | It shows I have one flight but got 17 charges on my card. Very confusing. Flight price changed while I was paying. Not very smooth. Easier to work with airlines direct. | Attempted on various days to cancel reservation through a virtual agent prior to booking date. 
Travelocity/Expedia proved to be unreliable and unable to retrieve information for cancellation. It claimed there were no itinerary on file. I have been charged a fee for a night of ‚ÄúNo-Show‚Äù policy through the hotel. Recommend booking to the hotel directly. | This app is very confusing, and the service is trash. I accidentally cancelled my cancellation insurance which I didn‚Äôt even know you could do. I couldn‚Äôt get anyone on the phone and the virtual assistance is confusing and unhelpful. It transferred between a few people, and nobody seems to know what‚Äôs going on. Save yourself the trouble and find a real travel agent instead of throwing your money away. | Everything is in Spanish. When I tried to change to English, this app wouldn‚Äôt let me save the change. | I am very disappointed in the decline of Travelocity. I would no longer use or recommend. | I had instructions on my email about the check in and code for the gate but code didn‚Äôt work. I had to call the authority and stay on line 30 minutes and then go through identification process and put all the information again including credit card numbers, photos of my ID and then my picture to register again to get a new code for the gate. Then room door code wasn‚Äôt working and had to wait to reset the code. I booked a hotel room with 2 full beds but room has only one king bed.
No extra linen and blankets which suppose to be behind the sofa in a bag. | Most of the app is in Spanish. I don‚Äôt speak Spanish. Language I selected is English. Didn‚Äôt do well in high school Spanish so app is useless. | I‚Äôm trying to book a flight back it says it‚Äôs available when I check through a different airlines but when I choose the departing flight for some reason it‚Äôs not available. Both flights were available last week. I find this to be a very frustrating & price gouging Situation. I have always used Travelocity when booking my flights.

Harmony Jobe | I like these app it‚Äôs reliability and friendly. | I downloaded the app and created an account; when I signed in via the app, everything is in SPANISH but I don‚Äôt understand, read or speak Spanish! I checked my profile and the language states English, but everything in the app is still in Spanish. When I log on via the website, my account is in English. I have deleted the app and then Re-downloaded it and IT‚ÄôS STILL IN SPANISH! I don‚Äôt have time to learn Spanish in order to use the app. Please Help!!! | Doesn‚Äôt allow variety of hotels or to choose city to stay in. Knocks out of site & won‚Äôt allow to sign back in for 15+ minutes! Stooooopid! | Keeps telling me to sign up even though I have 2x | I don‚Äôt remember when I downloaded the Travelocity app but I ran across it in my apps a couple of days ago. My mom died unexpectedly and she will have services in a community that‚Äôs just outside of New Orleans proper, in Violet, LA. My searches online (Google) as well as within my 3 membership apps (Bonvoy, Hilton and IHG) gave me few options and most of them were not within a close range of the services. The Travelocity app however had hotels and Airbnb‚Äôs that ranged from $99 and above and the locations were within 6 miles of my sister‚Äôs church. This is phenomenal news and it‚Äôs going to make a difficult time for my family (most of whom are coming in from other states) a lot easier! Thank goodness for the Travelocity App! | Travelocity, which I have used for about 20 years, suddenly seems to have installed options for nonrefundable vs refundable hotel rooms.  And it defaults to nonrefundable.  So if you are not super careful and you expect the hotel reservations industry to work as it has your whole adult life, you will reserve a room as ‚Äúnonrefundable,‚Äù and when your plans change you try to cancel and then get told your cancellation costs a fee equal to the room charge already imposed.  And if you call the hotel the hotel will tell you it is out of their hands because Travelocity does not pay them until the day of stay.  So I conclude that Travelocity keeps the money.  What a scam!  They should at least default to refundable, and you must consciously click to nonrefundable.  I will be arranging my Travel elsewhere than here or Expedia, its parent company, because they essentially tricked me and took my money for nothing. | Trying to get me to login, I don‚Äôt want to, not sure if app is limited because I don‚Äôt want to share my private information 

Listed things to do in Dayton, showed one bar and a tug-of-war event.  No mention of the best air history museum in the country.

Seems like it used to be easier to use in more helpful | Does not recognize the itinerary number. Does not show the trips I‚Äôve booked. Worthless. | I book a trip to an all inclusive resort January 2024. Our flight was delayed due to mechanical issue and could not get to the resort on the day I was booked. I called Travelocity out of courtesy to ask them to contact the resort to inform them I would be a day late. They insisted in order to do this the resort was charging me an additional $274.00 for the delay. With all the confusion that was going on at the airport with the flight delays I paid the fee because I wanted to be on my vacation. Upon arrival to the resort the following day at check in which I thought would be quick because I already have a room that was paid for so I should get right up to my room. That did not happen and also had to wait 3 hours to check in. Not only did I not have a room that paid for when I got there, the resort had no info that I was even booked for the day before. When I called Travelocity to ask for a refund for the $274.00 the man I spoke to said that what‚Äôs done is done and there was nothing I could do about it. He also said it was a fee the resort charges and when I asked the resort they said they never charged the fee. I will never use Travelocity again and will never say anything nice about this company ever. They rip people off and they will be reported to the BBB. | They take your money and when you are due a refund for reservations you never see it!!!

Had to make a change on the last leg of my travels. Worked out great! Thanks | I live 5 to 7 mins and Lyft sometimes charge 10 to 12 dollars and that‚Äôs definitely over pricing | Great driver great experience | CAR SMELLED AWFUL LIKE HE LIVED IN IT AND HAD ROACHES CRAWLING IN IT TOOK PICTURES AND SENT IT TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ALL THEY SAID WAS THEY DONT GIVE REFUNDS! THEY DONT SCREEN THE DRIVES GHETTO COMPANY DONT USE!! | This is the best Lyft ride we have ever had ride with smooth. The driver was courteous more drivers need to be like him. Driver was very safe. | I love to use again | I love how you guys will say the driver will be here in 7 minutes then 9 minutes later they‚Äôll be here in 5 minutes and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I‚Äôm getting real tired of these apps doing whatever they want and just screwing everyone else. | I was please by the atmosphere when I got in the car. Very Pleasant gentleman who offered some good advice. I was headed to Chop to care for my granddaughter & he made a great suggestion to go to PM pediatrics urgent care. Where he takes his children. I was truly blessed by this lift ride today and such a great conversation and music while I rode. Thank You Joseph | Rock star driver, I lost my phone and he called first thing next morning and met me to return it. Awesome guy, thanks a ton | Do your Best to avoid using This app! | Very personable very nice guy !! | I like Lyft | Thank you to Daniel for going above and beyond to find my friend who I ordered a Lyft for who was stranded at 2am and didn‚Äôt know where she was. Together we tracked her down before something bad happened to her. Thank you so much!!!! | I like the feature of being able to rearrange my airport ride with Lyft. Uber does not offer that feature where I live. The one thing I don't like is that Lyft does not let you contact the driver immediately after they accept the ride. I wanted to know whether my golf clubs would fit in the car. You have to wait until right before the pick up to actually contact them. | S√∫per | Best Lyft ever | Easy to use have not had any issues. | I have noticed that my prices are getting ridiculously high and would appreciate it if you could help me out with this. I have been using Lyft for over three years now and I always make sure I have money on my account but I can‚Äôt afford to keep using you at these prices | Lyft has been a life savor for me at times with better pricing then the rest! | Thx for helping me get homeüôÇ | Great experience:(( | ü¶æü¶æü¶æü¶æ | My title says everything. Genuine good human. | Great hospitality thank u so much! | ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è | I have always had the best of the nicest drivers give  me a ‚ÄúLift‚Äù ! | I‚Äôd love an iPad optimized version of the app. | The leaders of this company are bunch of whiney children when they can‚Äôt rape their drivers in Minneapolis anymore. Here‚Äôs hoping the leaders end up living in a dumpster where garbage belongs | Saeed was a perfect driver and so kind man and perfect personality ü•∞ü§©üòé | My driver could not communicate with me and drove off with my things.  Lyft customer service is incompetent and rude, asking me to pay for his mistake.  I decided not to retrieve my belongings since I reported the driver and who knows but he may retaliate. I‚Äôve never had issues with Curb, Arro, Waave, or Uber.  (I feel best patronizing Curb because the drivers do not own their cars and might need the money a bit more.)  This is my first bad review for anything.  I‚Äôd rather walk around Manhattan in the rain without shoes than ever use this app again. | Don‚Äôt know what car until confirm reservation. Had ski bag and had to cancel 2 rides.üò¢üôÅ | The same rides I have taken daily for years went up from $7-$15 depending on the time of day and driver availability now cost me $70 everyday all day. No matter what. I reach out to contact Lyft to make sure it‚Äôs not a glitch as my Uber rides still reflect the same price range. Customer service was rude enough to be condescending to me being such a perfect person who makes no mistakes since I am a 5 star rider for over 3 years and poke fun. So I‚Äôm definitely dropping this app. | Bonne application! Je vous recommande vivement. | In terms of technical issues, I have no complaints - the app works fine.  However, in terms of commercial issues, transparency, and reliability of information given - it gets 0 out of 5 stars.  
- Once a ride is confirmed, the arrival time DOUBLES if not triples without fail.  Every time.  No contingency for traffic at all.  
- When this happens, there is no recourse.  Cancelling your ride will result in a large fine that must be paid immediately.  
- Vehicle descriptions are misleading at best.  If it says the vehicle seats 5, then you‚Äôll probably get a subcompact car where the trunk is included in the seating estimate. | Vanessa was so friendly and gave us tips on places to go and restaurants to visit. üíó | We are so thankful she came to the rescue !!!! 1,00000 stars , we love it  !!!! | Benson was very nice and friendly! So helpful!! | Roan was very professional and kind.  Safe driver ü§ò | Will use again in the morning for ride back to airport! | I‚Äôve been a Lyft over Uber customer from the very beginning.  Not any more. I got the most ‚Äúpoor us‚Äù nonsense email, blaming Lyft‚Äôs decision to pull out of Minneapolis, MN on the city council‚Äôs ruling regarding driver rights. If your business model doesn‚Äôt support compensating your workers fairly, you shouldn‚Äôt be in business. | Cheaper would be nice | Took my normal route to work that I do every morning from Mon to fri.. but the last ride I took I was charged 4x the normal amount because the driver never ended the ride. There‚Äôs no way to contact Lyft and the only way I can try to report was through the help section on the app. I was refunded some of the money but still ended up paying double the amount for the ride. | So bad they can never tell where I am!!! So bad I hate it! The gps is always wrong! I don‚Äôt like it. They always tell me trip cannot be completed and I always constantly have to put in my pickup location and it still glitches! So much more expensive than Uber! Always! I really don‚Äôt like or recommend lyft | Took me to wrong address than what I requested very disappointing, had to do a second lift to get to destination | We exited the airport and there was our Lyft driver. It was more like having a private car service than hailing a cab. Straight home we went. I really enjoyed our first Lyft experience. | Thank you so much!

Thanks for making this part of being a Hilton Honors Member very easy and smooth! | I love Hilton Honors, easy to navigate when booking room and making r reservation‚Ä¶ | In September 2023 we decided to become a Hilton Grand Vacation member, we got the Hilton American Express card and started using the Hilton Honors program. It has been great. It has caused us to want to travel more and we always look for Hilton properties to stay in. The quality of the properties are really a step above. We have earned a lot of free vacations through the Honors program. You can‚Äôt go wrong with Hilton Honors. | I was treated  very poorly and rude from one of the representatives | Although these past years has been a hard knock! I love Hilton! I love everything about them‚Ä¶their customer service, their brand and all the beautiful resorts! I look forward to staying at as many as I can in this life God has blessed me to be in ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèæüòò | I realize it was past the cancellation time but I really wanted to change hotels so that I could have a higher floor. Didn‚Äôt know the one I reserved would only be on 2nd floor. | I am usually greeted as a member. However, I was not at my stay at the Home2 suites in DeSoto. | Love I can check in from my phone | Hot breakfast! Many fruits!Morden room! Friendly staff! Comfortable bed ! Clean room every days! This is very good! Close to the seaport harbor ! | The check in was easy | I‚Äôve been Hilton for 2 decades, it has been worth the loyalty.  The app is fantastic and allows you to easily use points. | Was going through a third party booking app this is way better | Your app is easy to understand and use! I like that I can link my Ada needs with certain hotels and previous stays, very helpful.  Your app makes registering and traveling with a service dog easier and allows me to list specific disability service needs for check in.  This  is one of the main reasons I prefer you over Marriott of Hyatt. | The Hilton app is streamlined and easy to use. Early check-in and digital keys are great too! | After I hit the button nothing worked- no check in- no key- no room with view? | Using the app is very easy | Seriously! I always stay at a Hilton property! Friendly staff always willing to help and with Hilton Honors I get the best customer service. Remote check in and keyless room key a must. Love it! Keep up the good work and I will continue seeking out Hilton properties only. | This digital keys never work | Have to go to desk for digital key | Very user friendly, simple but has everything I need . Most things can be done on finger clicks. Love the real-time chat with staffs from the hotel I booked. | The Hilton App and hotels have been very good to me. Last year I booked over 60 nights.  That is a good sampling, right? | This app is so convenient and easy to use. | Called ahead for a free upgrade and was denied. | Best prices and customer service! | Need to remember member number for login every time to register for offers. Very hard to navigate | Maha alnaimi | Very difficult to find out how to use points | I always enjoy staying at Hilton Hotels. There exceptional service and overall appearance and cleanliness is fantastic. | Valet parking was included with my room but it was not an option on the app. It was grayed in | The digital key is a fantastic innovation! I often arrive to the hotels late at night and the digital key really saves time! | This hotel has been great and easy to work with. Our trip has not gone as planned and thankfully this hotel has been terrific. It‚Äôs nice, clean and super friendly.  We are enjoying our time here. Thank you guys!! | BEWARE, just updated the app to the newest version and it will no longer allow me to check in or utilize any of my app features | Makes it hard to book | I will need to make more updates‚Ä¶
But experience with this hotel thus far has been superb!!
Highly recommend this hotel.
Top notch!! | We stayed Friday night, March 8 as part of a team booking.     I booked our room through a link that was sent by our team manager. I paid for the room with points ‚Äî and when we went to get what was supposed to be included breakfast on Saturday morning, I was told that we did not get the included breakfast because we had paid with points.     So, essentially you‚Äôre punished (for lack of a better word) for paying with points?     I called the hotel manager and she agreed that this policy is correct.  What am I missing here?? | Literally reading my Hilton Honors status to somebody and a pop up changed my screen to ‚ÄúSign up for the Hilton credit card blah blah‚Äù

Why are there pop ups? Did you hire the web developers from Yahoo in 2003 for your app design?

I have that credit card already and it still doesn‚Äôt make me immune to their pop ups.

Terrible decision to have this in the app | When it worked, the key was fine if difficult to navigate to (on a shared key)

The shared key worked for a while and then stopped

Digital checkin required us to still go to the desk | On the search page, when trying to scroll down, the screen starts shaking. | We have a Hilton Hotel AMEX & we have always had a good experience. The bad experiences we had were privately owned but Hilton still made it right. We only stay at Hiltons! | Hilton I really do not think it necessary to ram down our throats your company diversity policy with introductory pictures such as your app shows.    I am finished with Hilton properties. | Any Hilton hotel that I‚Äôve had the pleasure of staying in has ALWAYS been the best every | Excellent app, easy and intuitive to use. Easy to book. I like the contactless check in/check out with digital key feature. Was very helpful during the pandemic | Not easy to cancel a reservation. Bonvoy is super user friendly but not Hilton | Good interface and easy to navigate. Only quarrel is that the hotel icons on map view are enormous and hard to select. | I love it here so beautiful | For a major hotel brand the app should not have these many issues. It doesn‚Äôt keep up to date information. All of my history and points disappear. You can‚Äôt even book through the app. I have to sign in on the website. | Beautiful room, beautiful views, fantastic service!  I‚Äôve been won over! | App sent me a message that room was ready for checkin. I use the app to unlock the door and find out the room isn‚Äôt ready. Then, front desk moves me to another room that isn‚Äôt ready. After 20 mins, a third room is assigned that was clean. The front desk doesn‚Äôt take accountability of wasting my time, asking me to come back to the front desk twice while my sick wife waits in the corridor with all our bags. I never want to stay in this hotel again, but I don‚Äôt know if the app caused the problem or the local management. | App works flawless you get points earn discounts. Would highly recommend! | Easy to navigate and choices were easy to

It would direct people around traffic via back roads, finding better routes for all. But now so many go down back roads that it just clogs everything up, and Waze doesn‚Äôt recognize how bad they are. Waze sent  us to backroads for a merge, insisting it would get us there quicker, just a few minutes of traffic this way.

We‚Äôve been sitting in this traffic an hour, barely moving, debating a much longer route but no, Waze insisted we press on, that it was about to get better. It has not. Waze‚Äôs predictions are useless. | Sound no longer working, did all basic troubleshooting, reinstalled the app and updated to iOS 16.7 with no luck. | I used to love this app.  Best gps out there, for a little while.  Seems to me anymore that people just place hazards for the fun of it.  I‚Äôve seen countless times where I would say something was no longer there, and the pin remains.  Especially when it‚Äôs police.  And how in the world do you get rid of the stupid elf voice??? Even when I check all notifications and setting, somehow that dude still speaks to me.  It‚Äôs like nails on a chalkboard. | Waze now cannot even navigate to contacts in the phone, making it a pain to use if intending to use it as a GPS (the very thing it‚Äôs meant for).
Routing no longer allows simple reporting of street closures, so instead circles you back to try to force impossible turns.

It even tries to route you to things on the other side of a bay (Seattle area) rather than ones nearly to include ones along the current route. This is made worse since technically something being 16 miles away (but across the bay, so requiring about an hour to get to), shouldn‚Äôt be shown in lue of locations about 3 miles away.

It still has the benefit of fun voice options, and viewing other users on the map.p | Such a cute app it helps me get places quickly and gives me the best routes tells me if there‚Äôs an accident or any slow traffic. The kiddos entertain on car rides just watching little Waze characters. and have some low battery draining, but just keep it plugged in and you‚Äôll be good. This is a very good family map app and I definitely recommend it to every person young or old. | Waze used to be very accurate for commute times. Now it seems to consistently give optimistic estimations. I‚Äôd vastly prefer a realistic take than something that tends to get me there in 20-50% more time than it said it would. | I love this app it‚Äôs got good stuff but I wood suggest to put wiring Like there is cameras on the lights so that the person that is behind would respect if not then they should be a police man giving tickets | Constantly puts be in the wrong lane trying to avoid traffic in the dmv are. Ends up making me later than if I had just gone through traffic. | Waze, I like your map. I use all the time. I noticed that the speed limit is not showing while using Apple car play. Can you please correct this issue? I would be awe so grateful. Thank youüòÅ | Love this app! Would love to see a school icon because think of how many people use this app driving their kids to school. Thanks! | I got Waze a little over 4 years ago and have been using it ever since. I personally find this app easier to use and read than other GPS apps. I love this app for many reasons but let‚Äôs be real, the real reason is having Master Chief as my GPS voice. I hope they never stop having Master Chief as a voice option, it‚Äôs just too perfect! | Works incredibly well in open spaces, but where I live in Boston, it is remarkably frustrating because under the tunnels, it will lose reception. Also, when looking for larger areas, it will use the map directions, but it won‚Äôt use the directions as to where a person can actually drive into the complex or area.it has lost me multiple times with regards to larger parks or golf courses where it will bring me to the course, but not to the actual entrance of the course so I am driving around aimlessly looking for where I can enter. | It has a lot to improve its keep giving long ways and most stupid routes even tho i do not accept change in the route it keeps taking me the way it wants | Why does my Waze suddenly start speaking to me in another language? I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs Greek or Spanish.  
I do love the colors of the map on the new update however. | Has been the best, most useful, and easiest to use navigation app available. Lately, however, it has become very buggy. It seems to have started when they were bought out by Google. Perhaps they are just getting rid of the competition by abandoning it, because it has problems running on Apple Car Play. 1/2 of the time the map shows, but won‚Äôt show a route, you can‚Äôt interact with it on the car‚Äôs touch screen display, and it won‚Äôt go into dark mode. Sometimes it‚Äôs just a blank screen until you shut the car off and restart it. I don‚Äôt want to use Google Maps or even Apple Maps, but often, I don‚Äôt have a choice because Waze won‚Äôt work. Update: Just as soon as it started working again, they updated and totally ruined the app. Don't know why developers destroy apps with updates that completely change it. With this update, they have pretty much eliminated users reporting incidents, police, objects on road, etc. Because now, instead of two screen taps to report, it now takes at least three and sometimes four. which is not safe to do while driving. I'm not reporting anymore because they have made it more time consuming and cumbersome. I know many users will also stop because of this, which eliminates the feature that set Waze apart from Google or Apple maps.
They also got rid of the on screen speed limit signs, which is another negative change making the app not worth using anymore. | Has not been working since updating to ios17 | Mostly useful for looking at real time traffic conditions and routes  around them well. 

Comes up short on logical routes in denser areas, routing into heavy traffic vs around it. 

Use as a reference but also review routes and make own judgement calls. | The new update makes it extremely difficult to find saved destinations.  It also don‚Äôt show my calendar appointments and desertions anymore. The app version is the current update located on Apple Store and my iPhone is running iOS version 17.4. 

The new App update also won‚Äôt give in-app access to Amazon Music anymore. It only allows Apple Music. Before update I was able to chose Amazon Music as my Waze in-app Music. The update removed it and now I can‚Äôt choose. | Since update I cannot get Waze into dark mode during the day like I used to be able to do. Yes my cell is selected dark mode on the cell. Connect to the car screen goes in light mode. Thermos NO selections in setup on the car navigation screen or anywhere else in car setup to go to dark screen. This only happened after update. I uninstalled Waze re download Waze fresh reinstall. Connected and same results. What is weird is on my my wife‚Äôs car screen she also couldn‚Äôt go into dark mode. Was like this for several days or weeks then all of a sudden while she was driving in the day time Waze switched to dark mode. We both have the same make of vehicles hers 23 camera, me Tacoma 22. I don‚Äôt understand how hers finally all by it self went into dark mode as she and I both prefer. I‚Äôm giving it a few more days and if Waze doesn‚Äôt change will be deleted. | Not by tap shows alternative route as used to be 
Once click that  only one route ! Pleaee fix this 
Used to show local and fast   So pleaee fix this thanks | I gave this app one star and here‚Äôs why. I‚Äôve used Waze for years and for a long time it was invaluable to me. I drive a lot and I mean a lot for work in city traffic and up until recently Waze had an option where you could see alternative routes while you were already navigating. This was what made Waze really work for me. Driving in a city there are multiple ways you can go. Waze will always send you the shortest time route. But sometimes that route makes you cross over four lanes of traffic without a stoplight and other things like that. So when I can search other ways to go, sometimes it is worth one extra minute for my safety or less stress, but I can no longer do that because Waze took away that ability. Until they put it back as someone who drives all the time it doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore. I am very disappointed. For the record, Waze still gives you alternative routes but only when you first put in your location so if I wanted to see an alternative route, I would have to completely close out the app and reopen it and put in the address again which is just not safe or possible when you‚Äôre driving | Love the app. The newest update, however, has the navigation not giving all information. It will say ‚Äúin 1 mile.‚Äù But never say what to do anymore. | I personally love this app I use it every day when driving has saved me countless times from getting a ticket I know that it has a high battery drain but that‚Äôs why you keep your phone plugged into your port in your car to avoid all that glad to see the report police on the other side icon has come back. Happy about that overall this app like I said has saved my butt many times over have been using this app since it first came out and will be using it until something better or this app is replaced. Either way it goes I‚Äôm a loyal Waze user. | I wish like Google you can drive while having it in satellite view. It‚Äôs good for DoorDash because you can see exactly the house you need to go to and it be outlined by the address. | Recientemente quitaron la visualizaci√≥n de rutas alternas mientras conducimos, lo cual nos ayudaba much√≠simo para evadir tr√°nsito denso. Necesitamos lo vuelvan a poner, ya que en su lugar pusieron compartir trayecto, que no todos  necesitamos este dato, pero si las rutas alternas | Your bug reporting is not intuitive. With Apple CarPlay, Waze often has to be opened on the phone and then swiped closed / force closed and restarted in order for the mph and speed limit to reappear on the map. Please fix and thank you. | Be aware of the routes it‚Äôs taking you. It used to avoid tolls if you had the option activated to avoid them. Now, even with every single toll related thing set to avoid, it still chooses expressways/toll roads. | Great app, but recently the speedometer in Apple Car Play only shows up after I force quit the app from my phone. I have it set to always show in the settings yet it doesn‚Äôt show up. It started happening after a recent update so I‚Äôm not sure why it happens. | The last 2 months or so Waze is never accurate on ETAs anymore. Very frustrating. Deleting the app today and going to google. | I‚Äôm so disappointed this feature is no longer available | For the past year it would shut down and not work. It also would not calculate the routes I need and say I was offline even though it was connected to the WiFi. | Very big buttons with street names! It is so terrible, i can‚Äôt see any turns in city. Support says - it is not problem with map. | I find it aggravating that Waze opens every single time I plug it into Apple CarPlay. If you don‚Äôt remember this happens, then you can easily drain your battery by having Waze running in the background when your drive is done. The only way to avoid this is to disallow Waze from CarPlay.
I also find it aggravating that I can‚Äôt open Waze on my second phone at the same time. There are many times I want to test a different destinations, or a different route and compare arrival times without losing current navigation.
Google maps does things right, Waze does other things right, and I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt combine them in a more useful manner | This is the least easy app to navigate (pun intended) that I have ever used when it comes to checking a trip duration from a place you are not currently at. Keep setting up a departure point and it will revert to my current location. Frustrating. | After its recent upgrade, Waze apps does not alert you for any speed cameras, red light cameras, police and etc. Please fix the bug! Thank you | I have always really liked Waze. It is the best GPS there is. But the last update changed how I can choose the best route to take. It used to give me three options, the name of the street, the distance, and showed a map. Now it only shows me a map and the distance. Which I do NOT have time to look at the map while I‚Äôm driving it‚Äôs very dangerous. I wish they would put it back the way it. By giving the name of the streets that you could choose. | Love this app, have been using it since 2012-ish. We weren‚Äôt able to click on traffic reports of any kind for a while there & it was driving me nuts. Want to check a hazard & see how long ago it was reported? When a police was reported? When construction was reported? Yes, it‚Äôs important stuff! Thank you for bringing this feature back! 

Please keep it forever! 

*side note on new UI - searching for what you‚Äôre trying to report now takes much longer. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get used to it eventually.. | If you‚Äôre looking for an app to trick your friends, look no further. It looks like a real gps and almost functions like one, but when you‚Äôre on a long road trip will take to you to endless dead ends and completely blank areas of the map causing you to almost wreck to try and find a working gps, then download Waze! | I must have typed in an incorrect day of the month for my birthday. When you go to correct it in app it and change the day of the month and hit save it just defaults back to the incorrect date. Please fix. Thanks. Other than that a fun app to use. | I'm a waze lover but I've noticed with this map app and any other I tend to drive more impatiently if the time of arrival is shown and live updating... it would be nice to have an option to just have how many minutes are left to where I'm going since seeing the arrival time bump up a minute is painful to me even if I am not in a rush a all | This has been my absolute favorite navigation app for a very long time. I keep it up on my apple carplay every time I‚Äôm in the car. It doesn‚Äôt just give you directions and show the map. It will let you know where the cops are, wrecks, traffic, construction, and more. 
However, since the last update, my map now only shows the main roads, highways and interstates. Even when driving on a road it want show the road, it is just blank. Also, the speed, both my speed and the speed limit, will randomly disappear.   Once these things are fixed I will change my rating to 5 stars. 
Thank you | I have a problem after this update 
when navigating to a place from the saved one the go now button is disabled for me 
it gives a screen of the whole route 
it takes time to start navigating
before this update it used to start navigating instantly 
this is so annoying because if I‚Äôm at intersection I don‚Äôt know which way to go right or left 
and the wait time is so long to the point that I can miss a green light and all the cars behind me start honking 
please fix this | The digital speed records 3mph faster than my Lexus. This is misleading. | This app steals user data up to but not limited to user financial information. DO NOT CONSENT. PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA | Been a Waze user since close to the beginning and have loved it. But this last update has really screwed the navigation routing up. Randomly sending me of on dead end roads or giving my crazy time estimates on routes it recently ran without any issues. 
FIX IT PLEASE! | I have used Waze for years. I‚Äôve tried every known free app.
Those using electronics know glitches are common in about any device! 
But, over all the best in navigation in my opinion. Wazers keep well informed on road hazards and even law enforcement location. Arrival estimates are pretty good. 
Not so good out in the less populated areas. But, Waze is the best of choices! | Only way to get around ATL.  I use this daily for commuting.  Has the best information for traffic and the newest roads.  Way better at daily commuting then Google maps. | Perfet | Does a great job! No issues.

I called to costumer service to ask for a refund, Dominic help me out and he told me ‚Äúsometime we made some kinds of exception for cases like yours‚Äù, after 1hr waiting on hold, he told me that unfortunately they can‚Äôt do anything so my reservation still on. I asked to speak to a manager and they hung me up. 1st experience has been REALLY BAD!!!!!!!!!! | Awesome deals on a wide variety of hotels. Get the best deals on the hotels you would usually stay at! Highly recommended, use this every time we plan a trip out of town!! | Worked fine for 3 hotels on my travel and then wouldn‚Äôt accept my payments and wouldn‚Äôt sent a recovery email. I do NOT recommend this at all. It will be a complete let down. | The booking when smooth as always, but my hotel room 879 was lousy, the service room for cleaning wasn‚Äôt good at all, no garbages bags, the jets on the jacuzzi weren‚Äôt working , we wanted a king size bed  and we got a double bed room and the worst air conditioner was not working to top it off! | We have booked in the past with Hotel Tonight, and never had any problems.  However, this booking did not seem to transfer to Comfort Inn correctly.  They had our reservation, but said they did not get paid from Hotel Tonight?  We had to wait over 1/2 hour while they contacted Hotel Tonight/Expedia.  They were nice enough to give us a room, but didn‚Äôt get it settled with Hotel Tonight until morning. | DO NOT RECOMMEND! 

Arrived at the hotel after getting confirmation from Hotel Tonight. Front desk showed me a message they sent 5 days before they were fully booked. 

The worst problem is that I called Hotel Tonight and no one answered.  Straight to message that told me to email them. I will never use again. | Stayed there one night and it was lovely.
Just saw the opportunity to stay there again and jumped on it. | Great selections - across the board for every budget | I have used Hotel Tonight many times. They do a great job of finding good hotels at a great value.  Even the desk clerks will say ‚Äúwow great rate‚Äù.   In the past perfect for last minute selection and short term planing. But now you can book several months in advance so it‚Äôs even better for longer term trips. | Legit the best way to live on the road üôå | I been using this app for a few years now and it works perfectly, and the discountsüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ | Saved me $ | Service is great. Location is not ideal but on a metro line. Room is clean. Only negative, The pool is not heated and the size of a triangle hot tub. | This such a great app | I booked the room for February 23-24. I‚Äôm getting to the hotel and they see that they booked me for next week. I called them and I told him about it. They didn‚Äôt want to  cancel it or change the date. They are scammers and i had to book again. But I promise I will never use you again. | It is very difficult to verify room type and or search for rooms based on occupancy | Would not allow me to cancel when the hotel I supposedly booked has not answered my 6 phone calls in the past 2 days to address my concerns.  I don‚Äôt feel comfortable driving 2 1/2 hrs to a destination where I can‚Äôt even speak to someone first. | I booked a hotel by mistake and I request a refund afterwards. Hotel tonight worked hard on that and they considered my fault and refunded me in the same day. This is a such trustworthy company and website. Thank you so much‚Ä¶

I would like to give a big thanks for Snibika, Sam and Kieth for all the support and refund | Scours the internet for great hotel deals. Love the daily drop feature and overal ease of use. Never had a bad stay using. | It never works! Why is this app still broken? | Positive: clean, updated carpet, tile, wallpaper. Fwy very close. Negative: very thin walls-could hear next door conversations through the wall, shower next door just like it was in your room, middle of winter and 1 thin summer weight comforter. Had to call for a blanket. Also, laundry room backed up to our room on opposite wall, operating past 9PM. | I never book a room anywhere without first checking HT. They‚Äôre always cheaper than any other option. | For the second time, the rate charged at the hotel was much less than what I paid through Hotel Tonight. The lady at the front desk laughed when she found out what I paid. I hate playing the fool. | I like the convenience. I do feel pricing could be better vs Priceline or other but all good. The platform works. | This hotel lacked cleanliness. Every threshold in the hotel is filthy. Not sure if they bleach the towels. They were very dingy. | I use this app so much, for last minute stays and planning future stays. The deals are amazing! And, the loyalty program gets better the more you use it‚Ä¶deeper discounts, rewards, referral bonuses. Great product all around! | Its very simple to use, with some really great deals! Especially during the week. If you book a Friday or Saturday just a couple days in advance you‚Äôll find some really great deals too. If its a last minute thing, you‚Äôll still be surprised how affordable these hotels can be. During the week ive gotten rooms for less than $90 bucks. Just be sure to call the hotel before you arrive and ask if they charge you a refundable deposit. (Most are a $50 refundable deposit). But this app has been delivered on everything it promised. | This third party sets you up to think your getting a good deal, but you are getting screwed. The charge on this app is not the final charge. You get charged at the hotel for way more than the discount you pay this third party app.  NO REFUNDS OR OPTIONS FROM HOTEL WITH THIS THIRD PARTY APP.  
BUYER BE WARE OF THE TRAP!  You will be very very disappointed. | This app is excellent for finding great hotels with reviews at great prices. This hotel app is awesome and so easy to use and book hotels. | This app is great for a last-minute booking for hotels | I love this app. It‚Äôs so great and helpful. | I want to give the staff customer service 5 stars for accommodations. I had issues with extending the stay and each rep was extremely helpful. | Horrible room.  Beds were unfit for sleeping and need to be replaced.  Free breakfast not worth stopping for.  Do not stay at this hotel.  If this is a standard for La Quinta; they can say goodbye to my business. | I‚Äôm currently sitting in a hotel lobby waiting for a call back from Hotel Tonight. The hotel I booked does not have my reservation, so I‚Äôm waiting for them to sort it out. I will only book directly going forward. These intermediaries are unreliable. | I‚Äôve been using the Hotel Tonight app for years. In fact, I‚Äôve used it about 47 times and I have only experienced excellent customer service from them. I highly recommend using this app. | Great service when it come to booking

We used to be able to see the devastation of the fire.

Why is Google continuing to use old and inaccurate information? | Late to the game and so sad I updated. The ‚ÄúYour Projects‚Äù when collapsed is way too big a white blank blocking a significant portion of the Earth.  Can‚Äôt zoom in on photos. Terrible update. The previous interface was far superior. | Every time I make a placeholder the app starts glitching 
>:( | cool | Why update something only to make it worse?  It worked fine before, now it‚Äôs filled with bugs. You can‚Äôt zoom in on pics. And every time I click on a location to view pics the whole screen flickers and then freezes. Go back to the last version. This is not an improvement. | I love the new Projects tab - it's made keeping track of things I'm researching much easier now that I don't have to keep the material database and the name/info databases in separate apps. I'd give this feature 4/5 stars if I could, simply because the UI could be a tad better.

The issue is that I can't use this feature because of numerous bugs that occur every time I have tried to open/work on a project since last week. I don't know if this issue is unique to me or my phone, but often the menu I'm in will stay on screen but my inputs will log on the map behind it. Other times, when I try to edit something, the menu will begin violently flashing on and off the screen or moving around. The only way to stop this is to restart the app, just for it or another bug to start again.

Overall, the app is great and the new features are convenient and ambitious. However, they don't work at all. Please, I'm begging you, fix this. | I‚Äôve been using this app for over 3 years now, and today my screen constantly flickers. I tried updating the app, restarting the app, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cleared the cache, cleared saved places, cleared the history, restarted my phone, refreshed the networks, nothing works. With the entertaining explorer taken out, it‚Äôs been going downhill ever since. | I can‚Äôt see anything other than blurry green and yellow colors‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt get back in time and see what earth looks like years back. | Why is every image blurry now? Never used to be this way | The Google Earth App worked wonderfully for me over the years. Now it will not work and has some kind of virus and keeps jumping around the screen and not functioning at all. I've tried to adjust the app settings and deleted and reinstalled the app several times but to no avail. 
There is nowhere you can ask for or get help from Google. | Why is Timelapse blurry on mobile? | This app used to be so handy and easy to use. I was able to look up locations and use the satellite view. I even used the projects. Now, everything I search is blurry, whereas before it was clear. Looking at big blobs of green, brown, and blue serve me no purpose. If the hidden box at the bottom of the screen is my menu, it is ineffective as well offering little customization. | I can spend HOURS upon HOURS on G Earth looking at all the amazing places that I will most likely NEVER get the chance to see (which is SAD but besides the point). 

The thing that IRRITATES me the most after many ‚ÄúUpdates‚Äù ago is in viewing Pics on G Earth. 
For instance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you have Street View on and want to look at the Pics but you do not have the capability to ZOOM IN on these Pics. WHY??

We used to be able expand these Pics to get a better look but now we don‚Äôt!! I just don‚Äôt get it?? 

Unless there is some type of way to expand the Pics and I just don‚Äôt know how?    I doubt that very much for I am not a beginner using Google Earth! | Hooray! Amazing! Whoopie! | This app has not been updated in like 4years | You Google mad I mean Google Earth you have been a mess. You clearly have not upgraded your thing in four years so I need you to upgrade it or else I will sue and guess what I will sue you if you do not change it because it‚Äôs been like four years, so change it up upgrade it take pictures around here and so I want you I want youto upgrade it so I can have pictures of my houses that were not four years ago so I have an apartment my old apartment I go on go out I look at it like that‚Äôs like four years ago because | Apparently, this update is not compatible with my iPhone 7 Plus. The touch screen does not work, the application freezes and crashed | I used to love this app on my phone but now I can‚Äôt even search for a place without the search wheel going round and round with zero results! 

Very disappointing  boo hiss | How come every update is one step forward and two steps backwards | Constantly crashes, freezes up, and becomes unusable. This app has gotten worse and worse over the last year, and I‚Äôm about to just be done with it. Absolute shame. | Please more streets | Why hasn‚Äôt it been updated in years? The town I live in was added on to in 2019 it doesn‚Äôt exist on here | What has happened to this app?   There use to be a drop down menu in the upper left where one could take a postcard pic.  Don‚Äôt know what has been done, but it stinks.  No longer user-friendly.  And, that project in the lower left‚Ä¶what in the world is that? | Can not use map freezes and the map flickers useless | The earth is not a perfect sphere. This app shows earth as a perfect sphere when everyone knows its pear shaped. | please release Google Earth Pro for ipad Pro with apple silicon (M1 and other) ‚Ä¶. We need !!! | I‚Äôd like to start by saying I haven‚Äôt used Google Earth in my classroom for awhile. But now I need it and I‚Äôm having to relearn where everything is hidden/renamed. This app used to be so easy to navigate and I could easily direct my kids to the places I wanted them to explore. Now, I‚Äôve amassed a sheet of web links offering help - quite the waste of time when it could/should be in one place. (What happened to the downloadable pdf Guide? If it‚Äôs out there, I haven‚Äôt found it yet.)

Near as I can tell, Random Search has become I‚Äôm Feeling Lucky. Really? Why is that necessary? Cutesy titles are not helpful, especially when teaching 2nd-language learners. I‚Äôm guessing that Editor‚Äôs Picks is now Voyager. The transition between computer (Toolbar at the top) and tablet (iPad, in my case - finding Toolbar equivalent is not an easy task) should be uniform in appearance and function. Aside from using grid lines and reading latitude/longitude locations from there, what happened to the gps locations that used to be at the bottom of the page? They‚Äôre still there on the home location. And on the tablet, how do you relaunch Earth short of closing it down and starting over? And if you‚Äôre logged in, it opens to the screen you left. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | I love Google Earth. Mostly I used it on computer and iPad. I see a lot of changes in my area and surroundings however, the maps were not updated. Please UPDATE the map accordingly. | This new update I‚Äôll say has been frustrating. This app is temweaking whenever I try to find a new location in the map. I have to close the app to set a new destination | Google earth is awesome it lets me have a different perspective of 
 The world | I mean it was good but i could not find my location in my local island 
But its is go for finding restaurants to eat or airports and other important stuff | Get it together idiots | I used this daily for a decade, til the last year, and now it doesn't load at all. Tried every method, (cleared cache, changed user, reset, reinstall  updates, etc.), nothing works. It's to the point, Apple may need to think about removing this app, if they can't get it functional, in my opinion. | I like this app so much because you can visit any place from it | Street names, landmarks, and geographical names are not shown nearly enough on the map, especially when you zoom in. Makes it nearly impossible to figure out where you are on the map. | Latest update adds ‚ÄúYour Projects‚Äù which many users don't want or need on an iPad and there's no option for removing this screen space stealing undesirable feature. Google needs to add an option for getting rid of unwanted options like Your Projects. In addition, GE needs to seriously update the images for the iPad as they are years out of date in most cases. The images in Google Maps, Satellite view, are reasonably up to date. If Google is the provider of both apps, one would expect both apps to have the most up to date images. Definitely not the case. So much for a ‚Äústate of the art advanced technology‚Äù company. When reads the ‚ÄúVersion History‚Äù time line, every update purports to ‚Äúfixing bugs‚Äù yet the biggest bug always remains - out of date images.üò† | ËØ≠Ë®ÄÊòæÁ§∫‰∏≠ÊñáÔºåÂÆûÈôÖÂè™ÊúâËã±Êñá | The latest update in 2024 is less usable and more annoying to use than what I have been using for several years. I want the older version back. | Why remove the coordinates? | I am from China | Consistently crashes and freezes on Apple‚Äôs most powerful iPad 2024. Pathetic. | This is Google, who have the ability of allowing the creation of routes from one place to another on this app. Something that I argue we would expect from such an app. But they have not. I could go on about the lackluster UI and great sense of missing features, but I won‚Äôt.

 It‚Äôs still fun to flip through cities and navigate to planet with a pinch and a swipe, but they certainly pulled their punches on this one. Kind of sad seeing a company with their resources doing so little with them. | Me and some friends used this to find my science teachers house and dead husbands grave in 6th grade lol. It was  fun, also me and my friends made a game where we each Choose a country and we would take over free land and stuff and there were wars and things like that. Over all its fun (Also we did find where she lives) | Please make the Google earth measurement tool easier to use, and the only bottoms available now are the undo arrow and clear? What happen to close image to get SQFt? This is a valuable tool and I think it was fantastic but looks like it changed and is more in the background.. can you make this tool more user friendly with the option of doing SQFt and distance thanks | No longer able to see numerous details.
So sad. | Dear creators of google earth, on your website for Google Earth Chonos archipelago is misplaced. Chonos Archipelago is located in the country of Chile but if you search in Chonos Archipelago it brings you to 0 degrees north, 0 degrees south. I am raising this issue because it acted as a nuisance when I was completing my geography homework. Other than the issue of Chonos Archipelago, Chile I love Google Earth and have used it for several years.

Sincierely, an anonymous reviewer | Êâì‰∏çÂºÄ | I‚Äôve been waiting for the last couple years for google to update the map so I can see what my property looks like. Well they finally updated it and now my property is covered by a cloud. I can see nothing. Why would you put clouds on your map?!? | I was a consistent user of Google earth and loved it! 
I have no need to create a Project, but this is intrusive and blocks too much of the view. So I looked for an option to turn project off, discovering there is no MENU available in GE for iPad to see. I tried HELP on Google search and each one referenced a MENU and options. I deleted the app and downloaded again to see if that fixed it. The first time I opened (after the new download) I found the MENU to the right of search box behind my first initial encircled in green. But this MENU disappeared on subsequent openings of the app. 
I looked for a ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù option or any mechanism to report this MENU issue, but nothing.

App seems to glitch back to main home. Not going to book. I even tried to cLl, hold time exceeded 8mon. I hung up! | Why do I have to type in the destination every time I change screens. Just remember my last entry. | Why you promote to download the app if then you get it and the prices are more expensive everywhere. Same dates, same guests, same destination. | I downloaded this, haven‚Äôt gotten very far in it bc this just happened but I went in as a guest and clicked on the first advertised trip & the app crashed lol sooo I went back to this page that was still open & here we are | If you want to change your dates, you have to call them just for a quote and when they send you a quote you have to again call them to confirm and again pay $50 extra for luxury escape + change fees and again call them to confirm it üòÇ

Please save yourself the headache and book it from google flights or Expedia. Had the worst experience ever! | No place in app to enter promo code. | Bali 8 days, Phuket 4 days, Phi Phi 3 days.no point system? Be nice if so, will review once d in November. Over all great app, few glitches but overall very friendly. | PLSSSSSS add a sort by time zone or time zone range. As a remote worker this would be extremely helpful | Travelocity has much better prices including the flights I recently did Honolulu 7 days & 6 nights including flight a little over $1,600.00‚Ä¶..
The only reason you got a 2 was because you do have some beautiful location. | It‚Äôs so frustrating! Why is the map view gone?  Why can‚Äôt I just see all the packages you are offering instead of doing a search??? | Its not even working. Fix the app make its better and easy to use. | Muy bueno la informaci√≥n | - slow response time
- screen freeze, can‚Äôt scroll
 Luxury escapes is a great service but my god‚Ä¶ this is one of the most frustrating apps. The response time on the app has caused endless double taps on items. Randomly, scrolling will freeze. | I was just lookin for new places to go but if I wanted to go to A certain place this app would be useless. It‚Äôs not that many places listed. | This app/ site does not really find things you look for. If you type ‚ÄúU.S. Virgin Islands‚Äù, you get results for British Virgin Islands. Things like that make the search useless and annoying. It‚Äôs on par with Groupon, it has some specific deals it wants to sell you, it doesn‚Äôt have very many locations or specific things you may be looking for. | The app is useless! You can‚Äôt search anything! Don‚Äôt recommend | Every time I open the app there are new properties I‚Äôve never heard of. Love the Mexico and US Hotels! Very cool. | Since January you can‚Äôt login to Hitlist or create an account. Seems like Luxury Escapes follows their trail. Homepage doesn‚Äôt load | Is poop | I have used luxury escapes several times. Quite simply it‚Äôs just a good deal. | App is broken. | I have updated, then delate the App and download again, and the App keeps telling me to update! | I used to dislike the old interface - the video autostarts were annoying to say the least but it was easier to navigate. Now the left hand NAV is so annoying. If I am just looking for a particular type of holiday be it by location or by price or by length of stay it is hard to find.

The new trips feature is cool for planning trips or sharing trip itineraries with friends. | Hello. There is a bug with the current (11.2.1) version of the Stellar app for iOS. The app provides an option to use a Twitter/X login to create an account.

If the user backs out (cancels out) of the Twitter authorization login, the user will is sent back to an unresponsive Stellar app. The app freezes until it is manually restarted or deleted and then re-downloaded. This is very odd, as I have never seem this happen with any other iOS app. Canceling out of the Twitter authorization prompt is usually the first thing I do. I have never seen an iOS freeze the way the Steller app does.

My Twitter account of @RandomiOSBugs tagged the @StellerStories account online. Please investigate this issue, thanks.

P.S. the Steller app‚Äôs Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions links are not working on the Twitter authorization page either. | I used to love this app, I still do ‚Ä¶.

Except for the inability to create stories, with more than one page.

The format was far better when first created .
It was much easier to use. 
Maybe it‚Äôs just me , but the changes make it harder to compose stories that allow for multiple pages as it used to.

Also . I was locked out of my original story page ,  for which support was never able to help , making it u organized and harder  
to create. | After falling out of love with so many social platforms, Steller give the experience feel without the pretentious vibes of some *cough* other platforms | This app was so easy to join and will definitely inspire you | Great for finding beautiful places to travel! | I'm
So disappointed that this app was so much better and easy to share to download plus easy to make stories before.  Now I'm confused again it's like the 3rd time changing your app. I can't share it on my social media etc. I'm very disappointed and sad about it. | Love the app. You see travelers‚Äô perspectives organized around locations that are hard to get elsewhere. Like the simple nav too! | One of the better apps for creatives, it incorporates text, photo & video to allow anyone with a creative eye to present their work and/or their life in the most beautiful way possible as ‚ÄúStories‚Äù or ‚ÄúMoments.‚Äù | I‚Äôve been on this app for many moons.  I‚Äôve seen all the changes.  Some I love, some irk me to no end!

The best thing about this app is that you can explore the world from your phone.  You can plan vacations, workaround and add to your bucket list without the hassle of talking to a travel agent or scrolling for hours on other social media networks.  

O probably should also mention that  it‚Äôs simple to use and easy to share content to other platforms.

Download it today! | So cool to see how this app has changed over the years. I remember this before search was even added. Keep up the great work :-) | I just started using the Stellar app this week and cannot put it down! I love adding stories and seeing the cool new places I want to visit. And soooo easy to use. I‚Äôve been looking for an authentic travel app and THIS.IS.IT! | I‚Äôve had major issues with this app from trying to create an account to trying to post my first post. It seems either something is wrong with their servers or with the app. The only way I have been able to get in was by using a VPN. Even then the functionality still isn‚Äôt there. Considering who built this app I find that very odd. | Screw the algorithms, ads, and noise of your other social apps. Steller is a simple and beautiful way to discover and create stories. Turn the camera roll on your phone into beautiful stories to share with families and friends. I use this for trip recaps, building my travel hit list, and discovering hidden gems and adventure ideas. I can‚Äôt recommend this app enough. It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use. | I love Steller for finding travel recommendations and keeping up with friends travels. The new feature, Moments, makes it even easier to share things on the go! Great way to connect with fellow creators üòç | This app was so great but I still can‚Äôt figure out why they had to make every page auto advancing. I‚Äôm having to pause every page and it makes the entire experience feel rushed. There are other apps for that. This should be for well told stories that deserve more than 2 seconds per page. | I started using Steller recently and I love it! It‚Äôs such a great way to share travel stories and it is also perfect for sourcing inspo and tips for upcoming trips. It works well, has all of the necessary features, and the user base is full of like minded individuals who love to travel, get outside, and explore. | Been on the App for les than thirty minutes and my mind is blown. Incredible content from real travelers. Bravo Steller. | I used to love this app when it launched but this has become hard to use and needlessly complicated to create. | App is wonderful but I really need to be able to turn the sound off. I have the sound turned off on my phone most of the time so I‚Äôm not disturbing anyone else nearby. But the music plays on every story with no way to turn it off. Have to turn the volume all the way down, then hope I remember to turn it back up later. Really a miss in an otherwise great app and platform. | I cant reset my password knowing my username. I haven't logged in for about a year and yet my account is viewable. 

None of possible emails (of 3) received any reset email. | This app is honestly amazing, all I want to figure out is how to move the frame around so the photo i want to post i can center the subject in the frame but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs coming. Love this app so far! | I have been searching for an app that I could switch to from IG, since IG has so many ads these days. Steller is stunning! It‚Äôs not as active as Instagram, but I love that there are no ads and I can choose who to follow without algorithm suggestions. | I love this app, but is there anyway to pay for the service so there will no longer be a watermark on the page if I repost to other social media accounts? It ruins the clean layout of the page, and that is why I use this app in the first place. | When I first stumbled on this app, I was a love! A beautiful story book play this year short simple stories through photos and an economy of words would be ideal for sharing. Unfortunately, it has a ludicrous Instacrap format to it that you cannot control the speed in which to consume it. If I wanted IG, I would‚Äôve just gone with the real thing, but since I am not 14, there‚Äôs no reason to go with it. Bring back the old storybook format! | I love Steller because I can tell stories and write through a social media app. I‚Äôve only done one post but I already love the app! So much fun, and very simple. It isn‚Äôt confusing at all. (That sounded sarcastic but it wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm serious) 100000% recommend. | I really wanted to use and love this app.... I created a story but was unable to upload it I reached out to stellar via Twitter. Someone reached out to me and tried to help but then dropped off the face of the earth it‚Äôs been over a month and I‚Äôve yet to hear from anyone. I‚Äôm close to deleting it at this point there‚Äôs just no point in having an app I can‚Äôt use. What‚Äôs worse your story doesn‚Äôt save on their sever so if I delete and reinstall the app I‚Äôll loose my story ..... so wish I could have enjoyed it but oh well it is what it is | This is all that you need. One app for all your Instagram stories need! | Para mi es la mejor aplicaci√≥n que he encontrado para escribir mis historias con fotograf√≠as. Las herramientas son f√°cil de utilizar y quedan muy bonitas una vez finalizado el trabajo. Saludos desde Costa Rica | Update: Since recent updates to app,
Some of the best previous features are gone. It is not as easy to format and select styles, captions, and even to import photos. 
A wonderful medium for sharing stories - art, photography, recipes - easy to use. Highly recommend for creatives and appreciation. | Love how Steller has some beautiful and simple templates to help share photos of my travels and add tips and notes about the destinations. The new map feature is helpful for finding unique spots to explore. I also love that the stories can be downloaded and shared easily to IG, making story creation useful for multiple platforms. | Minimalist visual storytelling. It's perfect, easy, and across multiple channels. Done. | I love this app... it‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs classy very easy to maneuver. We all have A story to tell. Make it Stellar. | I just started doing this and I just read a review and I feel like the person had some very good points; it would be great to do little family skits and save them together and eventually combine all these skits to become a movie night actual mo a movie type bigger one you can include‚Äù just to have them in one place and all of the projects saved. I love checking out the stye 
This is not an option yet.  I also would like to change the theme for new videos etc.  Nonetheless, I will be using this one specifically probably more than a few Thera I‚Äôm will to train myself to use. Thanks overall. Looking forward to many acquaintances I love and we support each other. If you would like to pitch in too, show posts to others and get help when stumped, it‚Äôs all good. You‚Äôll belong. Children are encouraged to have interest in family stories. Not like is new grannies, and considered more than me and my family adventures aka best comedy to pee your pants from low bladder function.  Overall:    Thanks for all this! My new scrapbook project/ video family scrapbooking new is waiting to start. Too happy to form memories in an updated. | User experience is great with this app. Everything is where I expect I'm going to find it when navigating through it. I find that really important because apps that are easy to use keep me coming back. I'm really loving it! | It‚Äôs pretty cool! Lol helped me step my story and post game up a bit lol | Title ^

Otherwise great app, simple and not bloated. Minimalistic yet functional.
Love it. | One app I‚Äôve kept around on my iPhone but the iPad version is less than desired! Like half the apps available it does this weird non-full screen thing that has a black border that takes up 1‚Äù of of the screen on both sides! Until that‚Äôs fixed I‚Äôm iPhone only :( | Nice clean design layouts, and it‚Äôs perfect for me to get my artwork out there! Easy user interface. | This app is simple and straight to the point more articles should be like this versus beating around the bush | I‚Äôd been working on a post for stellar for quite some time, putting in hours of effort. 
Months later I went back to add other thoughts and pictures to this draft and it‚Äôs gone... 

I‚Äôm sooo upset. So much work done that I will never get back. 

Hoping Stellar will reach out with a solution. Hopefully they can recover it. | Love this app so much!!! | I can see how this could be a great way to share photos in a story format. I might be overlooking it but I feel there needs to be an option to change the background color. Not just by purchasing blush, but custom color, or even a photo from album. Also I think the option to rearrange the photo spots to where I want would be fantastic. Other than that simple to use and nice designs. | Just downloaded and it‚Äôs great so far | I hate this app. Bought several fonts and now they‚Äôre all gone. And it doesn‚Äôt do a square format for Instagram. Also, the choices in the purchased fonts are really lame. Meh!!!! | Occasionally I wish I could better place my picture in the frame, though.  But still, I have been having a blast using this app and have told everybody I know who takes pics about it! | I am completely in love with this app. You can explore truly beautiful photography and true stories. The app is not full of people that are just posting random stuff. I am truly hoping that it stays as amazing as this. | It‚Äôs dreamy! | I‚Äôm definitely feeling this App! The layouts are BEAUTIFUL, the font choices, the colors and the option to do multiple videos on one slide is amazing! And on top of that it‚Äôs so easy to share with other social media platforms! A must have in my book! Great for us globe trotters who want to share our experiences with a high end, user/reader friendly feel! | Steller used to be a fun, easy app to use.

- We analyze air tickets - we compare prices and layover options, finding the cheapest air tickets and the most convenient flight options (direct or with a comfortable layover).
- Searching for air tickets doesn't take much time - we filter and sort all the options for you. And you can buy cheap air tickets. How do you like the idea?
- You can subscribe to notifications about the cheapest air ticket, the most convenient one or the most direct flight (yes, this is possible as well). This way you can keep track of changes in the cost of plane tickets. As soon as the price changes, we will send you a notification.
- But these are not all of the subscriptions! You can also subscribe to the search for air tickets from your city and catch cheap tickets for a plane that flies in the most unexpected direction. What a surprise!
- We also have a ""Price Schedule"" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.
- And the ""Price Map"" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.
- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.
- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.
- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).
- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.
- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.

By the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:

- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.
- Guided and self-guided tours.
- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go

Plus they didn‚Äôt get there refund back yet | Great app but would be nice to search more flights with short or no layovers. | Dont do it! I booked a flight and they didn‚Äôt even send me a confirmation number no ticket just reservation information. I called customer service once i got to the airport becuase they said they couldn‚Äôt find my ticket and the lady didnt help she just told me that i would have to wait for a refund for 3-5 business days when I didn‚Äôt have any money to wait that long she didn‚Äôt care they messed up my flight plans and would rather have you wait outside3-5 days for a refund instead of sending your confirmation ticket through. | Did a quick comparison for flights to Spain. WayAway was $460; kayak was $315. | I booked a ticket for a promotion price. Then that media company told me I couldn‚Äôt take any luggage to flight and asked me to pay extra money, but I didn‚Äôt choose to pay. After that, they called me back and told me the price is gone, and gave me 2 options that pay extra money to get the ticket or cancel it with a cancellation fee. It‚Äôs my first time to use this app and it will be the last time! Be careful when you book ticket! Please call them before you place the order! I just want to share my experience! | Good | I just can‚Äôt. For the last 24 hours, I have been getting the run around from their customer service. False claims of reaching out their OTA agents, that are purposely posting inaccurate pricing. After numerous emails and screenshots, WayAway continues to
Promote the inaccurate pricing and thinks it‚Äôs okay for their customer to pay over 400+ dollars on airfare. 

Just use skyscanner in my opinion and stay away from bookmyairtravel that this app stands by and promotes.

Plus all these reviews are paid. | Muy innovadora y precisa .. felicitaciones | No recommended!!!

Please fix this. | I booked using this app and a few hours later I received a phone call and email to say that I needed to call as my booking was on hold. When I called they said that the airline didn‚Äôt approve the ticket so I didn‚Äôt have my booking at all!! Even though I thought it went through. They called me back and said the airfare was not a available from the airline and quoted me a new airfare which was $300 more!!!! No thank you!! | Ignore the positive reviews, they‚Äôre fake. It‚Äôs astroturfing. 

The developer Aviasales does not accept responsibility for the unethical business practices of their partners, claiming to only be a search engine. However, despite this they still act in bad faith as they continue to allow their users to be taken by bait and switch practices. 

What everyone else has already stated is absolutely true, they get you with a low price, and then when you ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù said ticket it‚Äôs not actually a ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù at all, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúreservation‚Äù in which they will tell you that the ticket prices have suddenly jumped $100+. 

I will be filing a complaint with Visa and JP Morgan Chase against both this developer and the service I got my tickets from. And will see how that goes before I escalate my grievance further. | By far the best app to find airplane tickets ever | Just booked using this app yesterday. Today l got contacted via the representative asking my tickets is getting canceled or I pay more. The fare master. | This app redirects you to a site called thefaremasters.com. They will monitor your data (including your credit card information) as you type. Even without booking they will call you and claim that you booked a flight and need to pay more. They are clearly are it based in the United States. They are trying to scam you. This is the first time I write a review but felt compelled to let people know. | I found this app while looking for a different flight finding app, I went ahead and downloaded it and it quickly became a favorite. I have found countless flights on it and even my family members ask me to find them flights for them using this app. I have probably booked around 10 flights on it within the past year. Just make sure to check everything about the flight before you book it, there can sometimes be weird rules and whatnot. You definitely won't find first class flights on here, but if that isn't your concern, then this app is the way to go. | I want to know how you know you buy a flight if they don‚Äôt send no email confirmation??? | I REPEAT DO NOT USE. THE PRICE IS LISTED IS NOT THE PRICE YOU‚ÄôLL END UP PAYING! | Unreliable. Book our tickets and got cancelled. Booked again and got canceled again. Same thing happen to my brother in law. Don‚Äôt brother. Don‚Äôt download this app. I will be deleting mines. | It should of kept the name jetradar name.It was a great app to find cheap fares. I like the old way because it allows me to book multiple destinations and the layout is easy to read. Now it‚Äôs not so great after the changed. | Very easy to use. There were only three tickets left so we tried to hurry. There was a slight price increase hit customers service was quick to let us know and make a decision on the increase. Thanks | Ok I‚Äôve been using this app for 3 years now. If you need an app that gathers info from multiple airlines so you can get the best price, period, this is the one. No issues or whatsoever. Very straightforward and neat UI. 10/10 would recommend. | I loved jetradar and recommended it to so many people but they need to try and work with these flight sites better. Recently my mom and brother has booked through them only to get their flight canceled and then rebooked and then canceled again and forced to pay another price. I realize this is jetradars fault but they need to not include these companies and update the Info correctly. These sites were myholidays and flight mojo. | I bought a plane ticket using this app, and was charged but was never sent a confirmation email or ticket number. Did I get scammed? I‚Äôm not seeing any way to contact Aviasales. | This app is full of bad news. It directed me to a scam sit called MyHoliday. Just another site that lets you book flights. Turns out it‚Äôs all a scam. You pay for it and they‚Äôll say they‚Äôre sending the tickets to you but later will call and tell you that there‚Äôs something wrong and have to pay more. After that, they block your number. I feel dumb for falling for this. It‚Äôs ridiculous that this app still stands. As said again. Please avoid this app at all costs. | Advertise and check out with one price, call to tell you they cannot honor advertised price and need more money. 

Checked that app and while the price had gone up, it was still showing lower than what was requested on the phone. 

Only time I‚Äôve ever felt the need to leave a review, would not recommend.

Edit: shortly after posting the review supervisor called and said there was an error, and I received the call by mistake and my price would be honored. You decide for yourself. Review changed from 1 to 3 stars to reflect that. | 0 star.
 Apple store should take off this app.

I booked a flight as $188, and I got email from this company saying my flight with American Airlines is successful and paid. 
But I couldn‚Äôt found my reservation at American Airlines at all. 
These guys - cheap fair may - are scammers! | Don‚Äôt book here I was scammed earlier out of 114$ this is a shame I had to go to Priceline to get a ticket | DON‚ÄôT USE THESE SUCKERS 
THEYRE SCAMMERS | I booked a flight through this app and they scammed me and took my money, then told me my flight increased by $80 when I went online and booked with another company for a cheaper price. I requested to get a refund and the company instead told me to pay extra and just buy the ticket which I didn‚Äôt, they completely ignored my request for a refund and I‚Äôm extremely disappointed I didn‚Äôt think this app would allow scamming businesses to work through it. I‚Äôm deleting this app completely. Do not download!! I‚Äôm also reporting this app to Apple | Me parece q la app anteriormente estaba perfecta esta actualizaci√≥n q le hicieron es un asco y ese nombre tambi√©n nuevo por Dios echaron a perder la app jetradar ü•∫ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Cancel my trip without letting me know,
Horrible customer service 
Ruined my vacation | Love love love Jetradar ~ don‚Äôt know that I like new name but the format is the most efficient bottom line value resource I‚Äôve saved plenty as a result of their good work 
    Thx | When it was jet radar I got great deals but ever since Aviasales took over I keep getting referred to websites that the price doesn‚Äôt stand. I tried three times today and every site has contacted me back saying the price has changed, so they may not be a scam but they definitely don‚Äôt check their sources anymore | So y all  take my money and cancel it tell me this is a joke by taking people‚Äôs money like that y all better send my money now or tell me y all going to fixed this 

Please note that your booking is cancelled. | The app sends you to Cheapflightsfreaks. I had the worst experience with this company and don‚Äôt recommend anyone to use this company unless you are 110% sure you are traveling. This 110% also includes if the world üåé is going to end because they will not refund your money and if they do they will keep a large amount of it. I bought a round trip flight ‚úàÔ∏è while the pandemic üò∑ was low. Once the cases started going up all around the world the airlines made changes to the schedule flights and according to the airlines rules the changes were considered major changes and gives me the option to cancel with a full refund. so I decided to cancel the flight and obtain a full refund because of the major changes and since I was traveling with my family and the Covid were going up worldwide. I contacted this company since I bought the tickets with them and explained the situation. After a long time on the phone and many calls I finally got a partial refund. They kept over $700 dollars for no reason even though the airlines issue a full refund since they made the changes. They make you agree to their terms if you want the partial refund. Worst customer service and company I dealt with. Is better to go with the airlines. Stay away üëé | This is definitely the best way to find flights on mobile. Google flights doesn‚Äôt have an app and AviaSales (formerly JetRadar) is awesome. I would rank the apps like this:

1. Google Flights/ITA Matrix
2. AviaSales
3. Skyscanner
4. Momondo
5. Kayak

Sincerely, The App in the Air Crew";"8.7.8";0;"USD";true;527299556;"AITA LIMITED";"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/aita-limited/id527299556?uo=4";"https://www.appintheair.com";4.63401;"Premium options are way to expensive to even remotely consider it. The ads creeping in for travel insurance, eSIMs, etc. are also making this app les useful and easy to use. I do enjoy using this to keep track of my flights past, present, and future but I think it‚Äôs starting to miss the mark for me. | This is the only travel app that has difficulty synchronizing all of my flights. This is also the only one out of the four paid travel apps that continually displays ads. I have asked them to disable them, unless I explicitly consent. I promise to do that. They lied. | Best thing about app in the air is being able to look down on my phone and see a push alert locked on my phone telling me how much time is left on my flight ! | Been using the app for a couple years and bought the lifetime subscription so I‚Äôm stuck with it.
Good features are that that it imports from TripIt. It can split flights between your own and other people. It updated to include live activities feature. Now for the bad - some flights are inaccurate or delayed. The app itself is confusing and has too much unnecessary information such as ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù countdown, ‚Äúboarding‚Äù countdown. The checkin is not even accurate per airline as southwest allows checkin 10 mins before departure but appintheair chooses an arbitrary time. Also lots of advertising to book hotels and other nonsense. If I was starting again I may go for their other competitor flighty | It is all good with the app except the past flights information can‚Äôt be found in all 2023 (including the flight number, departure and arrival). Hope you can fix this. | Best app available for your trip is very Accurate. You can see if there‚Äôs a Delay, if there‚Äôs a delayed of your flight is very accurate the information. | I absolutely love this app and use it to log and track all of my flights, but some features just need a little bit of work. 

Generally a trip with a layover has a single Booking Ref Number and ticket number, so if there's a way to input that without doing it for every single flight, that would speed things up a lot | This app used to be AWESOME, always keeping up with the latest information. But the last few years it‚Äôs not giving accurate or up to date info. Wrong gates, wrong boarding times‚Ä¶ imagine the impact of that on your travel day. I PAY for this app. A subscription. And now I don‚Äôt trust it. So today I am cancelling and this is why. At first I thought it was an anomaly but today I‚Äôm realizing they never got themselves together & inaccurate info is the norm for this app. It‚Äôs too bad.

UPDATE TO RESPONSE: I sent you all of that months ago. I‚Äôm not spending any more time on it. | Been using the app for a few years now and I just love all the new features and improvements to it. 

I don‚Äôt even need to upload anything anymore, it‚Äôs smart enough to pull everything from my Airline Loyalty Apps

Keep up the good work and looking forward to more new features you have in the pipeline | I‚Äôm not sure why I have to watch ads for travel insurance and a summary of my last year‚Äôs travel. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to get that off the opening screen and I‚Äôm a paid user. 

When I‚Äôm traveling I don‚Äôt want to wade through this clutter on my screen | Incredibly useful while flying an traveling. The support team is AMAZING in helping with any issues there may be. Great job guys! | this used to be my favorite travel app- tracking the arriving plane, up to date info before the carriers apps updated but over the last week (right after purchasing a year subscription!) it was useless tracking the flight, the plane that wasn‚Äôt even there and while i was sitting at the airport waiting hours for my delayed plane the app showed me to be in mid flight! i also bought for the apple watch face which i thought was a great idea but it doesn‚Äôt sync at all. next step is to cancel subscription and try to get my $ back since it failed so massively the time i needed it most! | I‚Äôm a flight attendant and I LOVED this all simply for the interface I could put on my watch! Though it stopped working a few weeks ago! I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling and updating my software and it‚Äôs still not working. Please, for flight crew everywhere, fix this! | I‚Äôve used this app a lot and am actually glad I have it. It keeps me updated on changes or delays, etc. makes traveling a lot easier when you have the right info. | This app used to work spotless but now when it says that the plane landed ,it is still in the air approaching the airport. Lifetime subscription and whenever deleting the last manually added travel information it says it is synching , you need to quit the app so it stops synching. 1-Your 2023 review does not get deleted and stuck there forever and 2-Do you need help also is stuck on screen. 3-Also found out that it tries to get my other iCloud account email account (although now that it is blocked) . I think when I got this app was to follow planes and not to book hotels and other stuff. Over the years a simple working app is bloated by information we don‚Äôt need.
The Apple Watch app does not work !!! | –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ –æ–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ —á–∞—Å–∞—Ö –ø–æ—è–≤–∏–ª—Å—è –±–∞–≥ | If you fly american whom i only fly this app doesnt work. Love that i bought a lifetime sub. Now i need a new app and cant even transfer all my stuff over. 

Heres to starting over! | They decided to use a pill-shaped progress bar for tracking flights, and even worse it uses green as the progress indicator.

As a result it looks like a battery indicator and it actually hides your real battery indicator. 

This needs to be seriously reworked. | I‚Äôve loved and used this app for many years as you can see from my review below. However, I am unable to recommend this app until an ongoing bug gets resolved. You can not add people (subscribe) them to receive updates regarding your travel plans. This is a huge feature of the program and I‚Äôve been told it will be fixed  soon. It‚Äôs been at least 18 months. As a Lifetime user, I‚Äôm about ready to cut my losses and try another program if AITA can‚Äôt get this fixed soon. Very disappointing.

I‚Äôve been using AITA for years and was so impressed that I became a Lifetime paid user. I had a UI suggestion and within 12 hours, I was contacted and problem fixed. I have never had such great customer service from any company. I‚Äôm not a big power user, but I sure appreciate the service I was provided as an occasional flyer.

Very cool flex to show off all your trips if you are a frequent flyer. | I want to like this app but it doesn‚Äôt always find my flight number correctly so i just have to add manually. I‚Äôve tried sharing my information to social media and it comes up blank. Flighty seems to be better | I've been genuinely impressed with this app's overall efficiency and user-friendly interface, making it a go-to for my needs. However, I encountered a hiccup when trying to import my flights from the calendar a feature that just doesn't seem to work. Despite reaching out to the support team for assistance, I was disappointed by the lack of help provided. This issue aside, I still highly rate the app for its performance in other areas. | It‚Äôs a must app for all travelers, especially those using IOS, flawless integration between all devices.  Knows about gate changes before the airline employee.  And all for free?  Forget about it | Constant notifications with an insurance sales pitch: please add on option for disabling it, it is super frustrating. 

Also Air France-Flying Blue sync/login doesn‚Äôt work. App has been quite buggy lately. It used to be better in the past. | Good app to keep and track your travel plans and history. 
Excellent Customer Support. An issue with adding the flights to the calendar but corrected with a new update in a timely manner while communicating with the support staff. | Used to be a great APP but recently it‚Äôs getting weird! I‚Äôve been to Japan for more than 10 times, however in my record it shows only 5 visits (the routes on the map are correct though). It says I‚Äôve been to 69 countries in the record but only 64 countries for the stickers‚Ä¶ I chosen the English language, however every time when I tried to export my record as an image, it‚Äôs in different language‚Ä¶ please fix the above issues please, thank you so much. | Tried booking a flight from Chicago to Harrisburg, and the prices I was seeing in app were always 5-10% more than the ones I saw in google flights. Maybe they are pocketing the difference or their data is wrong. Either way, it does not give me confidence to book with them. Also choosing which class I want is not straightforward, with the info not matching the airline website, so it‚Äôs not clear what upgrades I‚Äôm paying for (like is seat selection included? Is ‚Äúpremium‚Äù seat selection included? Etc). | The app idea is great. But the options don‚Äôt work as well. You can‚Äôt link a reward account. It doesn‚Äôt accept any of the codes you‚Äôre given. And a lot of features were available without subscription and now all you can do is see you flight info which you get through any other app anyways. A bit disappointed. | There‚Äôs a few things I really like about app in the air - consistency of information makes traveling a lot easier, a single place with my travel history - and it‚Äôs pretty easy to use.

Once they started making subscriptions a priority - the app‚Äôs now riddled with useless info, for subs and free users alike. Maybe worth it if you travel a lot and are looking for company üëÄ | I‚Äôve been using this app for several years now. Their support team is great and has helped me resolve issues I‚Äôve had. Recently however the app has continued to make more and more features premium only, even though they used to be free. It‚Äôs a shame to the app become less useful with these changes. | I can‚Äôt enter my data for United and it won‚Äôt tell me why not.   I paid for this? | Been using the free version since 2019 and worked well in the beginning.  Once you have used it for awhile and start logging a lot of trips the program gets buggy.  Definitely wouldn‚Äôt buy the program now since the basic free program doesn‚Äôt work. | This app tracks you across other apps and websites using your identifier, asks for your passwords to sensitive websites, and sells all your info to the highest bidder. Or at minimum are storing it ready to sell, as per their privacy policy, to anyone who buys them out. 

For an app that costs so much, it disgusting how much data collection they have. 

Go with Flighty! Less data collection and a much more polished app. | I like the basics of the app. But there are glitches when adding anything to the wallet. | I watching on Flightradar24 the flight JSA232 (6-Oct-2023) circling near to the airport. Yet app in the air announces that the flight has landed. It is not the first time such glitch happened. Quite often the app informs that a flight has departed, yet you can see the airplane is sitting next to a gate | Been forwarding email to just@add.flights many times in the past few days to add my flight to the account. The function doesn‚Äôt work! Reached out to support who promised an agent will reach out to me in 12 hours but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone reaching out.

Overall, this app feels like a beta. Flighty maybe more expensive but it does the job well in terms off flight management.

Cons:
- it doesn‚Äôt  tell you when your gate changes 
- weird language display: when you flight in enroute, it will tell you your flight is landing in approximately how many hours instead
- flight itinerary forwarding via email doesn‚Äôt work ( I tested with Southwest Airlines)
-  Auto check-in mostly doesn‚Äôt work. Mostly because when I set auto check in to my flight it doesn‚Äôt do anything instead it keeps notifying me about check-in. There‚Äôs no way to mark if I‚Äôve checked in for a flight.

Keep raising your price without making your app better is definitely a straight ticket to heaven. | Love it | Not working after update | While the latest update may have fixed 30+ bugs, it also caused a new one. When trying to view an existing trip, the app crashes. | Used to be a great app, now it‚Äôs extremely bloated with half of the stuff not working properly and the other half just being too cumbersome to use. 

On top of that the app has changed its focus to try and get you to book things through the app (probably for commissions), constantly nagging you to book a hotel or this and that with no way to disable it. 

Such a shame. 

Nowadays I‚Äôd recommend Flighty over App in the Air in a heartbeat, Flighty is more focused and streamlined if you fly regularly and aren‚Äôt in need of all the noise about hotels, rental cars, sight seeing, passport, boarding pass, etc. etc. | Very usefull. | I‚Äôve been using this app for a few years now, and it is by far the most useful flight tracking app I have ever used, and I use pretty much all the big ones that are out there. The tech-support is also incredibly responsive and address issues within a day. I‚Äôd highly recommend this app to any frequent business travelers out there, along with a lifetime subscription that is well worth it for the additional features it provides. | I am frequently flyer for my business. I gave this app a try for my last few flights. It was consistently wrong in its timings for boarding, flight tracking, and landing. Even when I reported delays directly in the app, it would show the flight as boarding about to end when we hadn‚Äôt even started yet due to the delay. Shows the flight landing when we‚Äôre still in the air. Come on this is basic stuff that you can pull from any number of sources. 

The UI is clunky, cluttered, and confusing. There‚Äôs too much going on. They need to focus on getting the basics straight and not trying to do everything all at once. | I‚Äôve been using App in The Air for many years and it has been a trusty travel companion. Unfortunately, over the past couple years, the developers have pivoted their business to flight and hotel bookings.

Each time I open the app I am accosted by up-sells and customer-hostile designs to lure me into booking another flight or hotel. But, that‚Äôs not why I originally fell in love with this app ‚Äî it was because it helped me track and plan flights! The developers seem to have lost sight of this, and have all but abandoned making any improvements or design refreshes to the original flight tracking and planning features. It seems, somehow, that those core features have actually gotten worse (and harder to access). In fact, compared to some of the competing flight tracking apps, App in The Air now feels clunky, corporate, and out-of-touch.

PREVIOUS REVIEW (5 stars):
Love having flight paths and information along with boarding times on my watch and my phone. Slightly inconvenient that there's no pull to refresh feature on the iPhone - which means I have to force quit the app and open it again to see changes after adding flights. | I‚Äôve not been traveling enough lately to justify the paid version yet, but it‚Äôs been great to keep documents in one place. I like the maps and stickers and trip data aspect of it. I‚Äôd like to see it take the profile stuff a little further and add a trip log for writing about the trip, and have the option to keep it private or post it to share with other travelers. Over all, it‚Äôs pretty much unrivaled in what all it can do.

Update: I have the pro version now and it‚Äôs pretty comprehensive. Being able to add documents to all the trips and append hotel and car rental information in addition to notes on each trip pretty much hits everything I need. Looking forward to playing around more with it. | Easy and convenient app to make traveling a little more stressful. Good app | In the last year or so, this app has gone from decent to horrible. Their flight database is not regularly updated. When scanning boarding passes or manually entering flight detail, the information added is incorrect. I personally I am on multiple flights each week and the information they have in their database on major carrier‚Äôs flight numbers and routes is incorrect. having provided them with multiple examples of this, the response received is always ‚ÄúThe carrier it failed to update our database for us.‚Äú honestly, what major air carrier, or any carrier for that matter, is going to update a third-party apps database on flight detail? | It‚Äôs a generally well-ish designed app, especially for the user interface, however, there are still many kinks to be smoothed out. It frequently and senselessly groups my random hotels and flights together with no way to splitting them up. For example, why would a hotel in Japan for august be in the same trip as a flight from Chicago to San Francisco in a different month? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Another big issue is that, it reads flights booked but not cancelled, that‚Äôs still fine but often it can‚Äôt even add flights with a clear confirmation from the same airline. Same airline, same email format, but some flights get recorded and some not. I just don‚Äôt get it. 
So yeah, decent app, but much improvement needed. 
Thanks dev team. | I‚Äôve used this app for a long time but now it‚Äôs fallen behind . It doesn‚Äôt give you information on some airlines. For example, Zipair it doesn‚Äôt give you the gate or terminal.

This app works on deception to the end user at all levels who do not understand how to legitimately book travel.  Avoid at all costs and book direct instead. | Best website/app to search for your flights | install this cheap free app now!!! literally it made traveling 100x easier!!! | Best deals of tickets | I have like this app for several years, ever since I heard about it, I‚Äôve been able to search numerous fly to numerous states in numerous countries, always leave me in the right direction | I absolutely love the Momondo app! It's a fantastic tool for organizing trips and finding cheap flights. The user-friendly interface makes it a breeze to search for and compare flight options. The app's ability to provide a wide range of flight choices, along with helpful filters, ensures that I always get the best deals. Plus, the price alert feature is a game-changer, helping me snag those unbeatable fares. Momondo has become my go-to travel companion, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone looking to plan their next adventure! | I love this app. It gives good results for every search I conduct. The fact that I can track flights makes this app even super. Will recommend it to all interested in traveling. | Ok ch·∫•t l∆∞·ª£ng | Algo bueno siempre tiene margen de mejora. | Very good | Perfect ü§© | Very good | Searching all those sites at once is really powerful and helpful! | This search engine has great options and comprehensive listing of fares and itineraries. Excellent filters too. Very good if you need to search for for mildly complicated transoceanic routes. | As someone who has been a pro at shopping best deals for flights for years, momondo is hands down the best app for the job. | With iPhone 13 app doesn‚Äôt work | I‚Äôve loved the speed and ease of this app, but recently realized I need to be more vigilant about where it is sending you for the deals. 

Searched for flights, and upon selecting one we liked, was redirected to a different site, ‚ÄúFlights Mojo.‚Äù If this happens to you, DO NOT purchase a flight from Flights Mojo, they are absolutely a scam company. After completing our reservation, we received an email that it was not complete until we called them. The number took us to a call center abroad where we are  informed that the flights we reserved are not available, and then the operator tried to extract more money for completely different flights through completely different cities. It was *extremely* difficult to leave the call with any assurances that we weren‚Äôt being charged, and we are still really worried about having given them credit card info. Other reviews of Flights Mojo online have nightmare stories about reservations cancelled and no refunds issued, demands for more and more fees as well as photos of identification and credit cards to be sent. Lots of people left high and dry when they try to use tickets. 
I have no idea if Momondo does any vetting for where it sends you with searches, but please be aware that in this instance they‚Äôre allowing a very sketchy company to solicit your financial information. | I have been looking at multiple airlines who fly to me requested destination and This app is only showing one option. Totally not correct | Tried to book flights three times and they changed the fees every time baiting me for more lonely- total SCAM | Unfortunately, momondo has no protection for its users from booking tickets with scam like travel agencies like edreams, etc. If this platform kept allowing these companies to lure customers into their scam like businesses operation, it‚Äôs basically a culprit. 

##For other users, please be careful for the third party booking websites momondo is directing you to, some may never refund your money even when promised. Read online for honest customer reviews before paying or book directly with the airline. | Really good in searching for cheap prices and it‚Äôs my go-to app for almost all my travel expenses | Wether it‚Äôs a room or a flight you‚Äôre looking for, I‚Äôve found, by far, the cheapest and yet high quality places and airlines through this app. | Excellent | I‚Äôve bought 2 plane tickets now using momondo and compared to the experience using other services e.g. KAYAK, momondo seems to have all the upsides and none of the downsides. The search API is responsive, searches don‚Äôt take terribly long (~1min), prices are legit and low, and the purchase pipeline is simple and streamlined. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the purple background lol. All this, for free, is indicative of serious focus on quality. Nice job on this app guys | This by far the best app to me and this is just my own opinion someone else might have a different opinion but to me I like the way it‚Äôs set up in terms of breaking down time schedules and prices when you looking for hotels or flights no matter your destination been using for yrs it works for me | The best I have been able to find. Better than kayak, Google flights or skiplagged | Love this app | This use to be a great app until they started to send me massive spam about tickets prices I've been searching for (without asking me). Also, I've started to receive spam from some airlines from which I've blocked tickets trough Momondo app and I think they sell our email address. I'm moving to another app. | Monjurul Islam | The app provides convenience to track flight prices but even after setting up the price alerts , it never notify me if the prices have increased or decreased. | Brings the best prices as always. You just have to be careful with the websites that you completeyour booking from. | I love using momondo to book my trips however I don‚Äôt appreciate multiple sites asking for my personal information like my passport number & Identification card info ; I have book with airlines and they never asked me for these personal information; now I‚Äôm thinking twice to use momondo to book any trip kiwi was one of the sites who asked for my info when I called them they said it‚Äôs the airline so I called the airline and they said that it‚Äôs not them it‚Äôs the site kiwi policy ‚Ä¶ thanks momondo | Listen!! I love to travel and this is my favorite app to check flight prices! Amass The cheapest and updated you on flights if goes lower | I‚Äôve been using momondo since 2016 that‚Äôs 5 year so ago and from the beginning I‚Äôve had a love affair with it. User friendly and updates keep getting better. And couple of years I told my brother about it as the only choice for flight or Internatinal flights etc. Yesterday I referred my cousin to it. And I referred many others to the best online flight and hotel search engine Momondo has been my travel companion. ‚ù§Ô∏è | I totally understand but this is so stupid for the application to delete all flights to Russia or from it!!!! | Very good Ap for a long time until now. I was Directed to purchase tickets at Fare Bubble and thought I booked a flight but it was a scam website. Had to cancel my credit card that I used.  This is unacceptable and disappointing that Momondo allows this type of partner on the Ap. Buyer beware. | I have been using the app for years and have booked all my vacation during that duration using this app! The prices are not too good to be true they are legit! | Just like the title i bought insurance the rental company did not recognize and i had to buy a completely different insurance. Don't get car insurance until you pick up the car. Otherwise momondo can be good at saving about ten$ per flight reservation. | This side is like the magic genie you wish you always had to tell you all the different flights and times and you can sort by anything and you do NOT NOT have to go through any shenanigans. It takes you directly to the airlines booking site. No shenanigans. | I bought tickets yesterday, I did the payment and received the confirmation from Oojo, today they called me and saying that I have to pay $1K more. No body is here to solve the problem. Just Scam | Very effective website to get some very good flights. Pay attention to the total time involved. | I‚Äôve been waiting for 2 weeks to get my eticket still haven‚Äôt got it have to go to Florida in a week they say they misspelled my name and you can hardly understand the operators there very dissatisfied and hoping I can get my tickets since I took off work | YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME, THANK YOU ! | I love this app but recently stopped using because when I try clicking on Anywhere it does not do anything. Usually it pre-populated the ‚Äúto‚Äù field but it‚Äôs not doing that. | I need contact info. No numbers for them or the third party agent. I need to change my flight and I‚Äôm within the 24 hours. The third party is Travelgenio and I am seeing they have one star on Yelp. Why would you use them momondo?  Horrible. | The website allowed ‚Äúfare bubble‚Äù to post flight search results. The company is an absolute scam. They don‚Äôt answer their phone, email is bounce back, and IM has nobody on the other end.

This app makes booking a quality trip so much easier ‚ô•Ô∏è | You make life so much easier to travel  grateful for this app | This app has opened me up to traveling to places I never thought of heading to before. | Las ofertas de viajes son f√°ciles de encontrar, es una app muy intuitiva ü©µ | Just downloaded it and it just shows a beach photo but doesn‚Äôt do anything else. | I used to love this app as well but not anymore they used to send me deal from New York City to Europe before they change I got a lot of deal send  by what‚Äôs app they stop doing that they came back sending deal by what‚Äôs app but is not from my departure city and all deal is not usa dollars. | Can we get one of the filters to be a home airport. Also can we get the filter to only allow so many miles from destination entered. | Ever since the last update I have been receiving two notifications for the same thing at the same time | Searching for flight NYC to DPS and cannot find anything close to the prices advertised.  Flights are $800+ not $585!  What gives? | App crashes when i try to scroll down to see other deals. I am on iOS 14. On IOS 13 it used to work fine.
I really like your app and check it out regularly for deals. Let me know when you fix the issue and i‚Äôll update the review to 5 stars. | This site has many limitations and unless they have a deal that may or may not apply to one‚Äôs situation, the rest of the selected deal are not any better, if not much worse, than other sites with one exception, the site is not user friendly at all. | Not working | Redirects you to a safari etc page to book whichever flight. Might as well save ur memory space and just use the mobile site. | Best B place to find remarkable deals on travel | Nice and smooth | I have yet to experience a deal that benefits me in TravelPirates. I will keep looking for that vacation that wows me as a deal breaker. | The best for vacation to use | It would be great to have additional Sf/Oak departures! | Great App, great deals! Easy to use.. | Travel pirates used to give the cheaper flight by the green dots on the calendar. Now when you try to choose dates the green dots aren‚Äôt there and makes harder to find ‚Äúcheap dates‚Äù to travel | Once you choose a destination you‚Äôd like to explore it is difficult to scroll. No matter where I put my finger it takes me to another page instead of scrolling. Quite irritating. | Amazing deals and so easy to use! Love it!!! | I love TravelPirates, this travel website have great sales to many places . I always helps me a lot when I‚Äôm planing vacations. | This application provides great information about traveling and great prices. | Only downside for me is there are hardly any deals out of Atlanta which is the busiest & largest airport, so I don‚Äôt really understand that. My niece was lucky enough to book a trip to Paris from Atlanta for dirt cheap.  Please find more deals from Atlanta | Been to Belgium, and Italy, and headed to Nee Zealand next month.  I‚Äôve had the best experiences finding reasonably priced trips that fit my schedule! | While the app works well, once you click on the deal and attempt to scroll through the dates/locations and prices it becomes overly sensitive that it opens the browser link before you can begin scrolling. The moment I touch the screen to try and scroll after getting off safari from it being automatically opened to go back to TravelPirate, it thinks I select whatever date and opens the browser again. Highly annoying and upsetting. | Not user friendliness. 
Hard to navigate. 
Have yet to find useful. | I like the website and the concept of this app but some things are just not intuitive like why can‚Äôt I just create an alert with the given departure airport only. I just want to get all alerts if a deal is available from ATL. | They used to do it from other major cities like Miami and Fort Lauderdale etc. Hopefully that comes back. | This is used to be my favorite app but now any flight deals shown are from NY or LA, I scroll and scroll and scroll and don‚Äôt find any deals from any other major cities . Very disappointed. | No deals out of San Francisco area. | Please show deals from more cities than NY. You Never show deals flying out of Philadelphia. | I suggests tailoring deals to your user‚Äôs location otherwise this app only serves those who live in NY. 
I would give 5 stars if I could see the deals in my area. | You can‚Äôt leave the app to go check a note or a website because it makes you start over. Who are the developers? Who is in charge. Amateurs. | Great application with great offers! | My suggestion to improve this app is to make a tool where people can sort the deals from their departure city.
Many times when I will check the deals, the price is complete different from where I live.
I believe many people has the same issue.

Thank you, 

Michelle | This use to be one of my favorite apps where I could always plan a quick trip. However, lately they only show deals departing from NYC. Since I haven‚Äôt seen a change I‚Äôm deleting the app, no longer beneficial to me. | Haven‚Äôt used it yet but I hope these are the right prices | This used to be my favorite app for the last few years. I would find myself checking it several times a day, and I have scored some pretty great deals.
Unfortunately, few months ago they shifted their focus mainly on departures out of NYC. They also don‚Äôt seem to be bothered with people‚Äôs feedback asking them to go back to including other, major cities like they used to. 
Will be looking for a new app, unless they go back to the old structure in the immediate future. | Most deals are for New York or California. Doesn‚Äôt really help me find deals | This used to be the best app for finding travel deals, with flights originating from multiple major cities. Now it only shows deals from New York City.  So 5 stars if you fly out of NY, everyone else,  look for a better app. | It‚Äôs really the only way to see the world. Went on a once in a life time vacation to Mauritius, last spring using travel pirates.it was amazing, I‚Äôm currently using it now to book my next vacation!ü§ôüèΩ | I've flown all around the world with travel pirates. I'm so grateful for this app and it's 100 percent legit. | Would probably be excellent app if it had flights flying out of all cities instead of just New York. | They falsely advertise prices and when you try to book it the prices are not what they are promoting the ‚Äúerror fare‚Äù is a lie they cancel your flight after you book it. Don‚Äôt waste your time on this app üëé | I used to enjoy this app but at some point in the last 6 months or so it started to only show vacations and flights from New York.

How ‚Äòbout letting the road names get better as you zoom in so we can actually READ THE WORDS?

How ‚Äòbout Create a custom route and a save custom route upgrade? G-Maps doesn‚Äôt always find the ‚Äúbest‚Äù route around traffic, accidents and construction or toll roads.

How ‚Äòbout letting users (who‚Äôve already given you all their personal identifying information for you to sell for your profits) view business posted images without having to create a Yelp account (so they can sell our information for their profits). | WAY TOO INACCURATE.
This app is terrible since yesterdays update. They have taken away all the good parts of this app and replaced them with TERRIBLE UNUSABLE GARBAGE. Terrible | It is a super good maps app | Unlike Apple Maps or Waze, Google Maps neglects to show the proper state highway signs.  For example, the State route shield in California is the shape of a green miners spade (in honor of the Calif gold rush) with white numbering.   On Google maps, you‚Äôll just a generic white oval with black numbering. | I hate the app sometime gave u a longer route, and keep asking u to sign in, pls change that | I love using google maps to help me git home. | Having to update this app EVERY SINGLE TIME I put it to use is becoming annoying. | Mr. Sal Zambri is an exceptional lawyer. I consider him the GOAT of injury lawyers. It took 6 years to get Justice for our son. And he was with us the entire way with patience kindness and understanding. He is extremely professional and knowledgeable about injury law and great at explaining complicated legal stuff to laymen and laywomen like us. We could not have gotten through this agonizing ordeal without him. I would give him 6 stars if I could. May God bless him and his law firm.

Especially the interactive GPS and directions. It‚Äôs too bad Google removed the GPS-based directions and street view navigation on the website. | In 2024 you still open the map to Tulsa, OK every single time. Even if you live in Japan. What a worthless garbage. | Tried to copy an address from my clipboard into the search bar using the Apple keyboard auto-fill, it only copied the city for some reason. Ended up about 15 minutes away from my testing center and barely made it because I was steered the wrong way. The auto-fill feature needs to be fixed. | It noted closed roads on the map for St Patrick parade (and this is not the first year for the parade), but still planned route through closure streets, and keep on being me back to the closed area. Saw all cars crowded in the same closed areas. | Latest update has app clunky and difficult to find info. Should‚Äôve left well enough alone. Onto Apple Maps until this mess is fixed | ÿ≥Ÿäÿ¶ ŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿßŸäŸá | The on screen explorer tab takes up valuable landscape and can not be disabled. | Can barely use because I have to update almost everytime I try to open the app. | Constant updates are making this app no longer user friendly. It is becoming slower to react and does not even display the correct road names sometimes.  Stop adding new features Google, you are making me not want to use your products anymore. | Search for something specific, like a locations of a certain store, and the map zooms out to 50 miles and shows everything Google wants you to see, not what you search for.  Even if it shows locations, the maps are so full of adds that you have to read through everything to find what you want. | i don‚Äôt need to see where i am currently standing, i want to know how to get to where i want to go from where i‚Äôm standing, without using my exact location‚Ä¶ like i was doing for the last 10 years. i don‚Äôt know what use the maps app is now, that it doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äústarting point‚Äù ‚Äú destination‚Äù portion to create a travel route, only showing me where i am as if that‚Äôs going to help anyone get un-lost. revert the app to two days ago, because you have made it useless. | This needs a lot of work good work five star | I definitely would recommend this company!!

He was attentive, patient kind and friendly. Thank you so much for delivering food for our family! | Last update is terrible. Changed everything about my maps!!!

Very well decorated and maintained.  Had issues with a few roaches and running out of hot water daily.  Fix the few issues mentioned and this is a great place to stay. | Such a cute house, and located near everything we needed. We really enjoyed it! | The owners were easy to contact and they made our stay for a 2 day fishing tournament event extremely pleasant! Would recommend for a nice place for a family getaway. | Can‚Äôt even get to it before this review screen pops up | that is uniquely desirable with privacy protection included . | Was easy and they covered all of my questions without me having to call. | We had a fabulous stay at The Palms in Playa Flamingo. It was so peaceful and beautiful. We hope to return! | The Whitney Cottage was amazing. From the decor to the snacks and drinks the cottage and host are great. The location is perfect. Sitting outside in the evening was so relaxing. If you have the chance, this is the place to stay. | Booked and paid for the rental Nov 23, had confirmation email and the homeowner never responded with entry code or key.
When I called him he stated that he took it off the VRBO site! Apparently no one knew!!!!!
NEVER AGAIN with this site!!!!! | We had a very nice stay, thanks | I booked a family trip some time ago. We were in a 7 family house with an upstairs and we stayed for 1 week. The whole trip with insurance and maintenance fees was under $1500. The home was clean with amenities accessible to us. We had plans to sight see and that didn‚Äôt happen because we were so at peace in that home. We made unforgettable memories and I am forever grateful. | I‚Äôve been around for a long time, and I‚Äôve made many trips around the world and used to work in the hospitality/hotel business. This is the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had by far in dealing with a reservation that took me more than three hours and three days to confirm. | Do I have the reservation? Who knows? I don‚Äôt. I appeared to have  been charged some arbitrary amount. Guess we‚Äôll find out. | Love that my Expedia account and VRBO are now linked and can make easy reservations quickly. | The house was beautiful, clean and well appointed. Christy, our host,  was great to work with and took care of all our questions. A wonderful vacation destination. | Colleen was wonderful. She was helpful if any issue arose. The place was clean and had new appliances. The location was pleasant and convenient. | Loved the older session of this app, now I find it hard to navigate | Had a great time at My Happy Place and Seagrove Beach.  The house had everything that we needed and was very comfy for everyone.  The walk to the beach was short and we enjoyed the pool and pickle ball courts.  Close to restaurants.  Katherine was great to check on us to make sure all was good with the house.  Definitely would recommend. | So, booked and paid, two places got canceled on me now I‚Äôm about a week out and had to find another place. Not particularly convenient for my first time using this service. N | Needed to have curtains on the back windows and doors. Need to have more outdoor lights especially in the back yard. | Filters are too vague. If I enter a location I want to stay in such as Round Rock, TX, don‚Äôt give me Wimberly, Fredericksburg and many other locations that are miles away. Or at least give me the option to say only this location. Very frustrating. Also if I want to stay alongside a river don‚Äôt show me ponds or lakes. | There is no way to see the ratings I get from hosts. | Mr John
your home is beautiful and the neighborhood is fantastic. we enjoyed our stay very much.
My daughter let you know my husband passed after we got home but we thoroughly enjoyed our self‚Äôs. | We stayed at the property for four weeks. The house was small but well equipped and we had everything we needed. Plenty of room for the 2 of us and for other family who joined us at various times. Our contact, Cezar, was wonderful! We needed additional beach/pool towels and mentioned it to him. The next day the towels arrived via Amazon.  The beach chairs had seen better days; 2 days later, brand new beach chairs arrived at the front door. Cezar told us in advance when the pool was being maintained, the pruning done and when the exterminator was scheduled. No surprises! The best feature of this property, however, is the back yard. It is completely private and it‚Äôs obvious someone put a lot of effort into the plantings. The pool is much larger than it appears in the photos and was enjoyed to the max. | Place was very nice, fantastic layout and tastefully decorated - but the most impressive part of the stay were the hosts- great communication and above and beyond!!!!! | Easy for approval. Very budget friendly | Nice, clean place. Had great stay. | Very difficult site- hard to navigate | We gave this a 10 * out of 10* rating!!!! Super clean and roomy is an understatement.  Parking is secure and spacious. Well done for the property owners. And I live in Dana Point, Ca so my expectations were already up there!! | The app has a major bug - you literally cannot type in your destination in the ‚ÄúGoing to‚Äù field because no keyboard is shown. | I know where I want to stay. It is not in this list at all. I don‚Äôt see where I could enter specific info.  This is very very hard for me | The main reason that I do not use VRBO, is because of all the extra fees and other fees that they charge. Over $325 in cleaning fees, VRBO‚Äôs fee $550 to $600. That‚Äôs ridiculous, especially the cleaning fees. We own a cleaning service and foe 3000 square foot home, we charge $150. These are the two main reasons for not using this service. | I‚Äôve tried booking 2 reservations.   Nothing but trouble.   Guess I‚Äôll stay in hotel.   Much easier to book. | There is confusing accounting/ pricing in the ap.   Everything  else about the ap was easy to use and helpful including communicating with the owner, searches, records and payments. 

The pricing the customer sees and the owner/ manager of the property see are not necessarily the same and it caused confusion.  I think it was because of the one key discount , but still not exactly sure.  Discount is nice but almost lost perfect property due to misunderstanding.  Was not clarified for either party even after calling customer assistance.  Both customer assistance and property owner were really nice and helpful. | App freezes every time I go to search for a place. I‚Äôve restarted my phone. Uninstalled and reinstalled app. Changed my sign in method. Very frustrating. Not worth anymore of my time. | don‚Äôt force people to set a new password to use across all your travel websites Some of us will NEVER use Expedia or Hotels.com I just want to use VRBO!! But I will stop if I‚Äôm made to use what I don‚Äôt need to use | Upon arrival, None of the door codes worked. Nor can We open the lock box.  When we finally do there is no key in the lock box. They sent someone to help but it took 20 more minute. That is after already trying for 30 minutes. | There are not a lot of options for finding places like these to rent. Why can‚Äôt they list the nightly fee with all the additional fees included. I chose a cottage that was $300 a night. Then there are taxes, ok. Then there are cleaning fees, ok. But the worst there is a host fee, which is all over the place. I saw $100 and up. The place I chose was $488. Ridiculous! | Our stay was very enjoyable. The house was clean comfortable and efficient as well as being in a good location. Being a wood connoisseur, I was blown away with the black walnut kitchen table and chairs. Well done!! | Wonderful stay
Beautiful ocean view 
Clean and nice accommodations
Looking forward to staying again! | Very good website for navigating your way to the ideal place to stay wherever you‚Äôre going. I highly recommend. | Great experience every time we use them | Very easy to use‚Ä¶.. reservations | Often, when I select pet friendly, I read the full description and it states ‚ÄúNo pets allowed‚Äù.
Or, if I select pet friendly, and it actually is, I have to contact the owner to make sure they add the pet fee. | VRBO has quickly become my go-to app for booking accommodations. As a new customer, I've already enjoyed a few stays booked through VRBO, and I'm thoroughly impressed. The app's user-friendly interface makes browsing and booking a breeze. The variety of properties available ensures there's something for every taste and budget. For real! VRBO can make anyone feel like a millionaire. Looking forward to many more memorable stays with VRBO! | The fees and deposit amounts requested make the rental 3X the original rental cost. This business model can‚Äôt possibly last long. | They double booked our Airbnb and didn‚Äôt tell us until we drove 5 hours away and didn‚Äôt help find us no where to stay | My trip doesn‚Äôt always come up and not sure why. Hoping the week end of my trip it will work | The unit is plenty big for the two of us. Super well stocked for everything we needed and really clean.

The app does not give me the option to send the trip info to 2 emails. Since I am paying and she is traveling, it seems reasonable we would both need the details conveniently send to both cell phones/emails | Every city I put in come up no available train! No way to get from NY city to Portland Oregon by train? Gives no suggestions; nothing! I remember taking the train from NC to Seattle WA and enjoying it so thought I would take the train from PA to Portland Oregon but not possible according to the app. It will be just as nice of a drive. | I installed this app on my iOS17.4 about 1.5 hours ago. Every time I continue to the payment page, ‚Äúlogin expired‚Äù and I have to login again. Not only do I have to see that message every time (five times already) but I have to select OK three times to get out of the message! I‚Äôm not sure how confident I should be to board this train for a random or spontaneous tripü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | doesn‚Äôt work | The system will not allow me to log  on keeps asking me to change my password and when I change it, it does not accept it. I am frustrated cause I‚Äôm trying to prepare a trip. | We‚Äôre on the eastbound Zephyr right now, trying to see if we‚Äôll get to Chicago in time to get to O‚ÄôHare in time to catch a flight. The app is either lying to us or has no clue. It says that the train left Emeryville at 7:47 two days ago. It really left after noon! FWIW, we did get good info yesterday. Today, fantasy. We‚Äôre using railrat today. | The title says it all!! Easy to use and accepts Apple Pay. Didn‚Äôt have to create a login to get a ticket. Amazing experience, thank you | The Amtrak app pauses my audio every single time I open the app. It‚Äôs not an audio app‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no reason for this to happen. It‚Äôs a broken experience. | 1. After logging into the app (or website), I should be able to access my reservations without having to know the reservation #. That‚Äôs the point of logging in! So the user can find their reservation number and details. 

2. It‚Äôs not possible to print an eTicket from the app or website. Even Customer Service could not email an updated eTicket to me after they changed one segment of my trip. They said I‚Äôd have to ‚Äúask at the station.‚Äù (With fingers crossed, I guess!)

3. On the app, ticket information doesn‚Äôt show Arrival Dates ‚Äî just the time. 
Example: I‚Äôm traveling from Chicago to LA, and it shows ‚ÄúApril 9 Departure 2:50p‚Äù ‚ÄúArrival 8:00a.‚Äù 
When? The next day? Two or three days? How helpful is that? 

It would also be nice to be able to see the break down of stops on the way.

The main page of the app is cluttered with marketing stuff about ‚ÄúPutting Customers First,‚Äù which is exactly what the app does not do. If a customer has reached the point in Amtrak‚Äôs marketing ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù that they are using the app, it means they have or want to book travel and need to use the app to access their eticket and trip details‚Äî like which day they might be arriving at their destination. | I value the app in itself. I take advantage of tracking trains, and it seems to be accurate. However, the biggest issue is that I am not able to purchase tickets more than a few days in advance in the app. I went to the web browser to see if I could purchase tickets for a couple weeks in advance and it worked! So, developers, please fix this bug in the app! | Can‚Äôt find my trio | Just booked a trip thru the app.  Went back to retrieve info.  No upcoming trip.  I need the reservation number to locate‚Ä¶
Which I assumed would be in my upcoming trips.  App is not worth the time of creating an account | I usually have a good experience on Amtrak‚Ä¶ today was an exception. I have crutches and a boot. Didn‚Äôt ask specifically for disability seats and was given an assigned seat‚Ä¶ I asked the attendant if this was aisle or window. She barked Idk‚Ä¶ were full. Not true because coming from Philly to Wilson the disability seats were available just as on this return trip. She had to help with bags and didn‚Äôt seem to happy. I know the job is tough sometimes dealing with the public but a little courtesy and compassion goes a long way‚Ä¶during the trip I could have been more comfortable but wasn‚Äôt given that chance. I could have asked for better accommodation but decided I could make it. Thankfully, my seat-mate got off a few stops later and I was able to get the entire seat to elevate my foot. 
Sadly, she later got into a confrontational situation with another passenger whom needed to use the restroom during a layover. You don‚Äôt have to be nasty to inform customers if a service is not available. 
Hope the next experience will be better. 
Signed, Limpy Traveler | The app won‚Äôt let me purchase a train ticket. Fix it please | Worst app I‚Äôve ever used.  Tried multiple devices and website. Had to call an agent to buy a ticket. A complete waste of time. | This app has nothing going for it.  Everything is completely lacking in a step by step process of purchasing a ticket.  No steps seem to be recorded.  If you need to go back a step, relevant information is lost.  I spent more than an hour trying to book a two stage trip for two people and it‚Äôs nothing but problems. | Since the update today I have been having issues with the app opening and buttons not working. | App and content constantly disappears from my phone. Completely useless app. Unbelievable that they can‚Äôt hire a competent developer (like every other transportation company in the world has figured out how to do). | I am disappointed to find I did not have the comfort of a business lounge after purchasing a business class ticket for my trip to and from Chicago. I was told I had to pay an additional $35.00 to sit in the Lincoln Room which is their business class lounge. I had a 5 hour wait before my departure and should not had to sit with several screaming babies, homeless people, and in over crowded noisy conditions.  My business class ticket meant nothing.  What a letdown.  The passengers deserve better for the extra money. | Prior receipts should be available through the app. Very inconvenient to have to submit a request and wait. | If anyone losses an iPhone with the eTicket on it, there is no way you can print it for backup. If there is a way, let us know. Amtrak‚Äôs iPhone app is worthless if you can‚Äôt print the eTicket. | Easy to use app! | The app is constantly having issues and not loading my train info no matter if I restart my phone or reinstall the app. It just shows an error message over and over | Booked roomettes across from each other but when we boarded one was given away.  Why bother booking together if it‚Äôs just a free for all.  Not the first time. | I‚Äôm NOT a computer person at all, but there App is pretty easy to schedule trips or cancel trips. Love Amtrak. | This use to be a great app then all a sudden you can‚Äôt book anything on here since early Feb 2024 the website doesn‚Äôt work anymore either please fix the problem it‚Äôs been weeks | What a horrible app. The train arrives an hr late but the status on the app does not even reflect that. | This app is useless when trying to book within 30 minutes of departure while standing on the platform looking at the train. | Thanks for improving seat orientation preferences, I guess? But I‚Äôd honestly prefer it if my trips would stop disappearing abruptly from the app‚Ä¶ | App crashes every time on iPhone. Have to restart phone to make it work | The app freezes allot when at time buying tickets or trying to show your ticket in the train. You have to turn your phone off and turn it back on with hopes of it working. | We are temporarily unable to process your request message every time I try to search for BOS to PHL March 15-17 round trip 1 adult. | This is probably the worst app I have ever used. There are so many questions I could not find answers for that it‚Äôs totally unhelpful.  Need‚Äôs redesigned | Good app for booking train travel. Not very easy to see routes in order to see station alternatives to leave from. Pretty much can only enter a starting and final destination and select the train you want. Can‚Äôt use the app in landscape mode on iPad even when using an attached keyboard. | I‚Äôm in a foreign country trying to get my Amtrak boarding pass, unfortunately I don‚Äôt seem to find United States or Estados Unidos among the rest of the world, therefore I can‚Äôt get my boarding pass. | Amtrak is amazing. Spoke with Shy who helped adjust ticket time and with ease it was done without dealing with automated lines. | Don‚Äôt get travel insurance. It‚Äôs 3rd party and means nothing. I got to my gate door at the time at 9:59am. Literally running out my Uber for the 10am train that was still boarding below. They changed tracks and my Uber was 10 mins away when I was on time. So I was charged an extra $86 for the next train. That is now 30 mins+ late. We were just told it could be up to an hour or so now. So Amtrak can be late. But I can‚Äôt have grace. Or even just an exchanged ticket. | This app used to be useful before updating, I love Amtrak. It's less expensive than flying, generally on time, lots of leg room even in coach and is just generally a good experience. I HATE the Amtrak app. No matter what I do, every time I open the app or navigate to purchase a ticket in the app, I always get a generic ""error"" alert many times in one session. Ie: Let's Try Again
We are temporarily unable to process your request. Please try again. 
I've tried logging out, deleting and reinstalling the app and it never goes away. Every time I try to purchase a trip, l get the error alert when I hit ‚Äúpurchase"" and then I have to do my purchase in the web browser (which is also not an ideal experience). The app never remembers my credit card info or my address even when I've updated it several times. | 1. User data may be used for tracking by other companies. 2. Adding trips to calendar requires giving the app full calendar access. I don‚Äôt know if this is due to laziness, incompetence, or straight up bad practices, but absolutely not. Fix your stuff, Amtrak! | App freezes or says ‚Äúunable to reach Amtrak‚Äù. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen an app function so poorly. Useless | Not sure if it‚Äôs the web service or the app itself but I get too many errors | Nothing is working | Great ridership | La app no funciona, imposible planificar un viaje desde casa con amigos o familiares, imposible hacer seguimiento de los boletos adquiridos. No funciona, es una p√©rdida de tiempo. Es una app in√∫til | Great station.  Too bad it‚Äôs under utilized. Please start commuter trains from Temple(Waco) to Austin, and San Antonio.  It‚Äôs a shame to not offer commuter options during early am rush hour and pm rush hours. | Lunch was not good.  Lukewarm pizza and a salad with only a balsamic vinegar dressing.  It is the worst lunch I have ever had on an Amtrak. | The information including departure times on the site is often incorrect and they make it very difficult to rectify their own mistakes | the app is horrendous. it‚Äôs so slow and needs much more improvement. first, why not tell us the track the train is coming on? the MTA app is a perfect example of a clean and accessible app. second, FIX THE BUGS!! i had attempted to buy a ticket and it glitched out on me. i then saw that money was taken out my card when i never received a confirmation. i proceeded to call customer relations THREE TIMES and i explained the situation. they said ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible that your money was taken out and no ticket was received.‚Äù well it did happen, but how is that my fault? i am extremely disgusted with the service because they refused to give me a refund. i am a frequent customer. third of all, why are tickets so expensive when buying last minute? you don‚Äôt see that on the MTA. this is not the way to do business. | The first leg of a trip that if scheduled for my mother was canceled.  We tried to make alternative arrangements with Amtrack and the agent simply said there are no options.  So I tried to change the dates and was tools I need to wait until regular business hours to change the trip dates.

Do not rely on | The only reason you would download this app probably is to check security checkpoint wait times. And that‚Äôs where this falls the most short. 

It only gives an average wait time across the entire airport. At the minimum it should give times  per terminal. In  places like DFW where each Terminal has multiple security checkpoints, even more specific information is needed.

The funny thing is, some airport websites are able to give this information, so the data is available. Just not in this app. | I just downloaded this app but on searching for the airports I will be using no results come back. Location services are set to always | It does not update at all. | App won‚Äôt even load the list of airports, useless | This app does not recognize the names of any airports so you can‚Äôt use it. | Tried put 20 or more US international airports the app doesn‚Äôt recognize any | The app will
Not allow nor recognize any airports that I put in-
Philadelphia. Tampa, etc‚Ä¶
Very confusing- | This review has nothing to do with the app. It Hass to do with a total disregard for my belongings. My bag was searched, therefore lost in Philadelphia, and when I got it back, my bag was broken in five places, and all my belongings in my bag were thrown in like it was garbage, they even broke a very special oil that I have for my skin. I agree and understand that the bags have to be searched randomly, and I want that to be the case but to totally disrespect my personal items and throw my clothes and other items in like they had been tossed in the garbage can is unacceptable. | This app is ‚Äústuck‚Äù on download and I can‚Äôt stop it and it won‚Äôt restart | Over all, I would recommend the app. Currently there are some bugs that do need addressed. 
Example: if you go to the tab for ask TSA on the iPad, if you click on the tsa website. The app crashes. On a cellphone it goes to the website.
That is just one example. 
To me not being able to access what you need could be a problem. That is why I give 3 stars. | was flying out of atlanta and the wait times are not accurate. I would not rely on this app for wait times! from my experience it seems that the individual airport website may have more real time information. i almost missed my flight, since the wait was around an hour, and showed 15-30 min on the app! | I was hoping this app would tell me what time TSA precheck closes, but no such luck | Apparently this doesn‚Äôt locate airports in other countries. Couldn‚Äôt find Pearson located in Canada. | The app told me 0-15 minutes when I entered TSA. When I exited 45 minutes later the app still said 0-15 minutes. It is safe to assume that the same mouth breathers that work the checkpoints also do a terrible job maintaining their app. | App says Checkpoints 1 and 4 are open for TSA PreCheck, but both are closed and Checkpoint 1 doesn‚Äôt open until 4am according to an airport worker. | Shows generic wait times for security check (I.e. 5 minutes for TSA-pre and 25 minutes for regular)‚Ä¶ got to my flight at EWR and found TSA-pre CLOSED, and a 55 minute wait time for regular. Numerous people freaking out about possibly missing their flight. Better to delete the app and just arrive 2 hours early like 2019. | I downloaded this to see the wait time for security lines. It said 0-15 minutes. We waited at least 45. 
Instantly deleted the app. | Won‚Äôt let you post times! | Told me 0-15 minute wait. Took over 3 hours and missed my flight | There is nothing accurate about this app. | Great app very helpful | Why does TSA think that having the security wait times for the entire airport makes sense when it varies terminal by terminal? You're better going to the websites that have figured all this out way better and way more effectively than this app. The first time I used it, the prediction was so off I deleted it right off my phone. | App said 0-15 minute wait‚Ä¶ in reality, line was over an hour. Not sure what technology they use to update wait times, but it‚Äôs awful! Deleted the app. | Wait times seem to be completely made up. Showed under 15 minutes at McCarran, actual wait time was 45+ minutes | Beware!! It showed DIA wait times as being ‚Äú15-30 mins‚Äù two different times several weeks apart. In reality, the wait was about an hour each time. I don‚Äôt trust this app at all. Shame on you, TSA, for providing wildly inaccurate info. | I try to choose Favorite Airports. Then suddenly the app flips from the list of airports to a specific airport. After that it‚Äôs over. I cant choose any more airports. So i can only choose 2 or 3 airports? | Does not accurately reflect times TSA actually open. Does not reflect real time wait times. | I use Atlanta all the time and it still shows busy times being under 15 minutes. 8:20 on a Friday it took almost 40 minutes to get through standard lines. If you know Atlanta, they had us lined up down the hallways between the elevators! I‚Äôve seen no way to leave notice on the app it‚Äôs self. It would be nice if the app was in real time. This isn‚Äôt the pandemic anymore, people are flying. Let‚Äôs get accurate times on the app | Doesn‚Äôt work. I tap on the items I‚Äôm searching and nothing happens. Disappointing, considering that‚Äôs why I got the app in the first place. | Used to work fine. Now states no network connection. I have a network connection because all other apps work fine. Have deleted and reloaded to no avail. Beats me | APP makes it hard to search for an airport to check security wait times.  The Search icon is buried.  

More troubling however is SIGNIFICANT errors in the airport look up.  Looking for the Pasco, Washington airport (PSC) and the APP offers only Endicott, NY which also is nick-named the Tri-Cities airport

Pasco is a much larger airport, the location where United Airlines started and perhaps the owner of the PSC designation much longer than the Endicott airport has existed.

App also fails to find the name‚ÄùPasco‚Äù

How many other basic search errors exist in the APP???? | Finally! More apps and websites need to do this. It really helps your company out-an attractive design can do nothing but draw in more users. | myTSA will be great for travelers if we get notification if someone got positive! This will be a great traveling tool! The new design is sick! Kudos to that! | I love the new design! The airports map is really helpful! I wish you have implemented this feature before. However, the feature that I was waiting for is still missing. Actual wait times live!! Hoping to see this on your next update! | Helo Woled Thana You For a supportive App | Very informative | Thanks for creating this. It makes traveling so much better!!! | Saves me so much time !!!!! Love it | During this time of COVID air travel, many of the TSA Pre lines are shut down due to lack of volume. The my TSA app, however, consistently shows these lanes open even though week after week they are closed and have been for months now. The app is worthless for actually showing your true status. | Lo | Was helpful but I wish they could give more info, I would recommend downloading your airlines app, I love using the delta app! I do like that you can see what you can and can‚Äôt bring. | Great professional crew   Thanks for being there. | Very long lines and wait times.  Need to be updated. | Kellee Edwards did a great job promoting this app. I will definitely use it when I start traveling more. | Great information. | the best thing ever it‚Äôs a great thing | App is showing wait time at SJU of
15-30 minutes it‚Äôs closer to 60 minutes. | The TSA app is amazing especially when you‚Äôre running late, it tells you if you‚Äôre going to be delayed and possibly miss your flight. Tell the TSA officers your timing can get you up front and you won‚Äôt miss that flight. üòÄüòÄüòÄ | No Pre-check after 21:00?

Going to delete it from my device! | Paid for a year because it looked like a cool app to help plan trips. I‚Äôve wasted so much time trying to learn it and never managed to get a trip planned. Most reviews on destinations are over 5-10 years old. Regretting paying for this!! Back to square one! | Whatever | The app as soon as you creat a account, you can‚Äôt do anything with a ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù I‚Äôd rather use Apple Maps. If I could give it a lower rating I would. | They bought some really good products and managed to screw them up . Overnight camping worked great now its almost worthless and some how most of the sights have disappeared overnight, pun intended | It appears that the subscription plans have changed, but I was still billed automatically for a tier that no longer provides access to my trips. I was auto billed $35.99 to renew my subscription, but now I can only view 2 of my trips. When I click on a lock icon covering all of my other trips, it prompts me to upgrade for an additional $50. I‚Äôve used this app for years, but no longer feel I can trust it. I‚Äôm out. | Best App ever for road trips | Please resurrect the standalone Campendium app. I don‚Äôt want or like RoadTrippers and fine the interface and review layout bloated and unhelpful. Campendium was clean and straightforward, achieving the goal of allowing me to easily find, judge, and choose campgrounds. Please admit your error and resurrect Campendium! | Very limited (Google map provides more for free) unless you pay their annual charge. | Are not visible once a trip is mapped. Can only see the type of highway‚Ä¶ interstate etc | This app has gone from 4 star to one star for me.  I am planning a trip now (February) for later this year and I cannot plan my route due to seasonal road closures.  The roads I need to take will be open during spring and summer months but I cannot plan my route now.   On top of this now the price goes up to $35 year.   I like this app but it is now not useful for me.   Especially now that the price is going up and I cannot plan my road trip.  I will be stopping my payment renewal. | Got road trippers so I could find camp grounds to stay over nightFirst time I go to use it I find out you have to have premium to find camp grounds | What happened???! Now you want to charge me even more for more trips and more stops? This makes me very upset - I went from unlimited access and now all my past trips are locked up and my current planning cannot add more stops because I‚Äôve reached 20 stops??!   WHAT??!! I LOVED Roadtrippers before this, but you‚Äôve lost a customer. I‚Äôve canceled my subscription. | Please fix the issue with the road numbers being hidden under the route lines on planned trips! | If you‚Äôre planning a road trip in Ireland, don‚Äôt bother with this application. | Love the app and how easy it is to add stops and find places to see. However, the exit and road numbers need to show on TOP of the blue route line. Cannot see the exit and road numbers and end up opening a different map app to see them. | I saved my own trip map long time ago, now I wanted to check it and I can‚Äôt, because I have to pay for membership to get my own information. I‚Äôd prefer delete the app with unexpected surprises. | We‚Äôve used Roadtrippers for a number of years & adventures with more on the way! Excellent for planning driving time/distance, discovering fun detours and exploring new places. We love the easy toggles for a quick change to turn off a waypoint and the ability to add dates to the route. All of our trips are saved with the year and name making it fabulously simple to look back with fond memories! YAY! | the options and features are promising but no matter how strong the WiFi and which browser i try everything loads like a black tank clogged with poop mountain | I used to love this app and used it a ton of times to plan our long road trips, but now it‚Äôs all glitchy and I keep getting error messages every time I try to add or remove a new waypoint. Very disappointing especially since I paid for the membership. | You can only add one stop and then you have to start paying for it. | Cannot get a live person to talk too. Roadtrippers did something to my account and can‚Äôt log on. And yes it‚Äôs good till December of 24. Had it for about 3 years and loved it till now. I guess time to find another vacation travel site. By contract, I have to keep Roadtrppers till December but I‚Äôm done | My dad showed me this app and now I‚Äôm hooked to plan out trips. Setting up is so easy to do and all the tools after playing around it‚Äôs really fun and easy to use | After Campendium was merged into this app i expected to see rich campground data like i did with Campendium premium. I won‚Äôt be renewing. | I have used Road Trippers for a few years. This renewal not only did the price increase, they made ‚Äútiers‚Äù! So while I paid $$ ($40 or so) it still has my trips I have spent months working on, locked for not paying for the ‚Äúpremium one‚Äù. Either I have to re start my road trips on a new app or pay road trippers even more money than I already paid for them to quit holding my trips hostage. 

I will never renew this subscription again due to this shady practice of theirs. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous and definitely not a way to keep people subscribing to your app. | This is my third and last year subscribing to this app.  When I went to renew this year, the price had almost doubled and instead of being allowed to plan 300 trips, I am only allowed to plan five.  So for $50 a year I can only keep 5 trips at a time, I didn‚Äôt understand that or I wouldn‚Äôt have renewed at all.  I used to put locations I would hear about in general trip for an area so that way I wouldn‚Äôt forget about the location when and if I was visiting the area but that‚Äôs no longer possible.  It‚Äôs a shame they had to get so greedy, this is no longer a good value for the money. | BEWARE:Roadtripper will lock you out of your trip, once you are part ways on your trip to force you to upgrade to their premium plan!  Not worth planning a trip with this app if it leaves you stranded.  I have a year subscription left, but will lose that money, since they locked me out half way through my trip. They are dirty bandits!!! | No customer service phone numbers only email which is frustrating when they have your account wrong yet they can‚Äôt figure it out. | Roadtrippers has ruined Campendium and I‚Äôm pretty bummed they will sunset that app for this crappy expensive one. I don‚Äôt care about road trip planning. I only care about finding campgrounds and Campendium did that in a straightforward way. I open the app, and there is a map using icons that make sense and are very legible. Could you at least steal the same interface from Campendium? And while I happily paid them $23.99/yr for that I won‚Äôt be paying a penny for Roadtripper when it renews in Sep ‚Äò24. And they want $60???!!!!! Also the emails have no instruction how to merge accounts. This is a horrible app merger functionally and financially. | To have used this app since around 2018/2019 and I have loved it, advocated for it and encouraged friends and family to upgrade for $30 per year. It was well worth it. I loved planning our trips, seeing fun things along the route and mapping out time. 

This year they doubled the price, I can no longer access all of those amazing trips I painstakingly spent hours creating. If you are going to increase the price you should at least be able to access the ones you previously planned without editing capabilities. I will no longer support or advocate for this app. What a disappointment. | If traveling in a country ar okay, but not if you have an Rv. | I plan an entire 14 trip into Canada and then log on and I have to pay a yearly payment to see the trip? What a waist of time, needless to say the features of app are lacking in general, POI‚Äôs aren‚Äôt even in the correct spot. What a stupid marketing plan to let people create a trip and then block them from seeing it unless they pay $49.99? Devs are clearly inexperienced and lacking basic app development skills. I‚Äôd suggest hiring a project manager with some experience in app rehabilitation. Good day, I‚Äôm gonna go find a better app. | I‚Äôm enjoying planning road trips on this. | Immediately starts pressing for upgrade and hinders the attempts to Delete the account | It has been now two years that I have made such amazing trips.
I have also recommend it to those who ask how I am making my vacation. Every year I make round trips . The best was Route 66. OMG what a trip that was. All because of being a member with Roadtrip.
From hotel reservations to visiting all the wonderful sights on the way.
Just write where, when and how many days you need.
If you want to make  the best vacation join RoadTripper. 
I‚Äôm 74 years old and it‚Äôs going to be my third year. If I can do it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Trust me you will have such a wonderful time designing your own trip. | It‚Äôs easy to navigate and has so many helpful tips! I love this site SO much! My family LOVES roadtrips and the first thing I do is come here to see what‚Äôs in that area we‚Äôll be in. I also appreciate that when I find something inaccurate and contact them it gets updated accordingly. Looking forward to using it more and more! üòäüíúüëç | This makes exploring before a trip fun and easy. In the last couple of years or so my wife and I have traveled 8,800 miles using it and have another 2,600 planned for this summer. Now that we are retired I have a circumnavigation of the US I am planning, with 84 destinations and covering 20,000 miles we will take next year.

Their support is great, and I find the cost a bargain even though I have yet to take advantage of all the features the product offers. | I love this app but I am considering something new after the cost of the membership that I had went up $25. | I wanted to be able to put in my destination select a few filters and then have a route along with the best stops. | Initially got this app in 2021 for a road trip. It was okay and buggy.  For $59/year (2024) up from $20/year (2021) is too much of a leap for questionable value improvements. Also the confusing Roadpass vs Roadtripper accounts supporting the app are unnecessary and consumer unfriendly. There are other means to accomplish road trips at little or no cost. | I rarely feel compelled to rate an app, but this one irks me. I used this app once. Overall had a good day experience with that. We aren‚Äôt regular travelers and I forgot about it. I don‚Äôt know anyone that signs up for a trial and forgets to cancel, at some point. It has happened to me a couple times. The apps have always been so accommodating and refunding. NOT THIS ONE! No leniency. Just an email that says their terms and conditions say no refund. Definitely not the way to win good reviews or returning customers, or someone who might recommend it. It‚Äôs also not just a couple bucks. It was just charged and is good for a year. A full year where I don‚Äôt intend to travel using it! Warning to make sure you cancel, or no way you‚Äôll get a refund. No recommendations from me! | Sadly, you need to subscribe to plan any trips now.  The free app was good while it lasted. | Whether creating a quick rough estimate of miles and fuel costs, or researching and adding detailed stay over stops with nearby things to see and do, this tool makes it simple. 

Once the trip is defined, it‚Äôs easy to share the route with your favorite navigation app/device. 

Print the entire trip and itinerary for those cases where internet access is spotty or non existent. 

As trips go, I don‚Äôt leave home with out it ! | This app use to be so good and helpful. Now the devs are greedy charging for plans when everything was free in the past and was a great app to use. I don‚Äôt mind paying but $60 for 150 stops is ridiculous when you are trying to plan a 2 week roadtrip. Looks like after 5+ years of using this app I will be moving on due to them being greedy. | I live everything about this app , BUT the fact I gotta pay for the whole year is absurd ! Why is monthly not an option? I only need it for one road trip why are you limiting your

Everything is so cool! | Great app for planning the trip without missing the most important sights and ajustable to your travel length | I love this app.  It truly makes planning a visit to a city EASY!!!  I love how it builds the itinerary based on your timeframe.  Some things i wills look to see as enhancements:
1.  Allow download of plans to be used offline
2.  Allow user to default start times for specific itinerary items
3.  Allow users to select method of going from one point to another (eg. allow me to self walk if i won‚Äôt want public transportation)

App is a must have!!!! | I like my privacy thru require you to be tracked through Facebook google and others not just use while using the app  I unstalled fast! | Needs a blurb about each city before the onslaught of tours. I need some insider information - the essentials - about the city, history, weather, geography, best time to go, events, landmarks. I want to read some information before diving into tours. I know they need to monetize the app, but it feels like advertising. | This app can‚Äôt seems to find almost any hotels, either by name or by address. | Wish you could add ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù in the app like you can on the website also Need to be able to add different hotels on the same itinerary other than that- Make‚Äôs planning multi day trips so easy when you have a lot you need to get in and can‚Äôt waste time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank you. | It‚Äôs a good apps for the trips. I suggest to add direct links to the monuments | We have used this app on several trips in the past couple years.  It is wonderful!!  With the maps, day by day itineraries, and suggestions, we‚Äôve been able to navigate our way through London, Athens, Paris, and now we‚Äôre using it to help plan our trip to Rome!  It‚Äôs a lifesaver!! | Spinning wheel forever. Worst app in the age of chatgpt | I‚Äôve been using the app for 10 years, I travel A LOT, I adjust times, dates and activities and attractions w easy. Usually I am the lead in my groups and people are always so impressed and satisfied. I set activities that are near eachother for same day, usually hitting one region or area per day. Very seldeom I use public transport, usually all by foot and the map option allows me to plan accordingly. | I have used it all over the world, very good and helpful | The program works well, but I was unable to figure out how to list more than one hotel and use the app to plot which sites to see from each hotel site. Also 10 days is maximum. Limited in allowing you to travel between different cities on the same trip. Nice listings of attractions close to each other and offers a variety of itineraries to adapt to your plans. | Very versatile, flexible, you just choose a city and you have many options to plan accordingly. | Joan did a spectacular tour. His knowledge and perspective of both the city‚Äôs history and local color made Barcelona come alive. I definitely recommend this tour and Joan. 25 stars! | That‚Äôs the review.. just got a blanked out screen on iPhone. Tried on android the same.. bummer | This app constantly forces you back to the beginning. You‚Äôre on day one, every time you go into it you going to go through plan your trip, your plans and then sometimes it‚Äôs not your plans but the generic guide they give you constantly reloading.  In your travels this can get really expensive. Also there used to be an offline downloadable map which was amazing. | This app is amazing and it‚Äôs a staple for all of my trips. One problem is adding a stop the app doesn‚Äôt recognize. I wish we could add an address if the app doesn‚Äôt recognize it as a destination. | Freezes constantly. Every few seconds! | I consistently recommend this app to anyone I meet that tells me they are traveling to a new city! It‚Äôs incredibly easy to use and flexible. You are sure to optimize your time using it to see top attractions anywhere in the world! | I was thrilled to find this helpful site and even happier with the intuitive way it works.  I have reworked our week in London a couple times and it was easy peesy!  üòä | After long hours of working on my itinerary, I then tried to download and print.   Though it said it had emailed the itinerary to my email address, it never did.   There is no print option, when you select print it just says it emailed it.    Not what I had hoped for. | I‚Äôve used this all over the world, whether on vacation or a short business trip. Best way to be efficient and knowledgeable! | What a great place to start your planning for any trip. Offers such a variety of options and how to pace yourself. | I like the concept, but to get started it‚Äôs not user friendly. One I remember how to input everything it‚Äôs smoother | One of my favorite travel apps! | The best app ever.  It help me travelled around the world.  Everyone should have it | Truly a phenomenal idea and an amazing app. Thanks to the team. Great job. | I rate this the BEST guide to plan for visits to  any city ! It is very time- saving to visitors! | This | Friendly use | I used it in Italy, New Orleans, San Francisco and more.  It‚Äôs awesome.  Saw so much more than I would have been able to with out its direction.  Signed up for tours I never would have known about.  Fabulous! | I have used this program several son the last couple of years.  I love its ability suggest itineraries to Mach the available to see the sites | Fantastic app and I‚Äôve used it to organize and maximize many trips regardless of how long my visit will be! | Nice concept but you need to do a lot of work on this app or website. Can not edit your travel itinerary or move your plans from one day to another.
Can not add ‚Äúthings to do‚Äù from the tab into the itinerary, sends you to another site. | this app is so useful and helps so much when seeing a new place especially when it gives you a map overview of all the attractions | Love this app for city planning. | I have been looking for an app to track my trips and add places that I would like to go. This app gives me ideas by setting up itineraries for me and allows me to adjust them to fit my needs. One thing that I would like to see is the ability to change the actual times. We made reservations for dinner and I may I am not able to change the time for that particular item without adjusting the length of the time I‚Äôm at other places. | I‚Äôm just gonna say it‚Äîthe interface is kind of trash! There‚Äôs a lot of functions that would be nice, convenient, and rational to have that aren‚Äôt there, and if they ARE there, they‚Äôre not intuitive to find at all. It also gives me clunky mapquest vibes. 
But‚Äîif you like trip planning, it definitely gives you that satisfied feeling once you have your itinerary all filled out. Also, after seeing the website, the app looks a lot better. Happy traveling! | This app has been a godsend for our large family, as we have been traveling in Europe! It is a first rate idea generator, even suggesting a sensible itinerary. Not only that, but when we had difficulty with tickets from a vendor the app listed, the Cisit a City customer service stepped up to get us a refund. Exceeded my expectations! | I love looking at Visit-a-City to identify the sites in a particular location. And I have been able to find some great tours and activities to book. | We use visitacity to map out our trips.  It p provides  an easy to follow itinerary.  If you are a planner, this is the App for you. You will not be disappointed. | I love this app!I have used it for international multi country trips as well as trips within the USA. You put in the where and when and your planning is almost done for you!  I would highly recommend this app for anyone traveling whether you have kids, want to relax or go and see everything! | I admit I found it much easier to use website to plan the trip then the app.  I tried tons of travel planners and this is the best site.  Once you have the plan done, you can share it or for me being old school, I printed it for a hard copy.  There are areas it can improve on, but compared to other apps, this easy.

I had to email them with a technical support and they were awesome.  Download it and give it a try, but remember the website is easier to do the initial plan.  5 stars me is odd, but this app deserves it. | This app is awesome! I am a international flight attendant and i use it everywhere I go! | I‚Äôve used this app in several cities and have found the itineraries excellent for planning. I would recommend it to anyone | If you want a decent travel itinerary this is THE APP, an excellent app. I did the 13 days in Italy just as planned, one of the best trip ever. Thank you Visit a City !!! | This is the only app review I‚Äôve ever written, and this app has earned it.  Thank you, developers, for making this!  You‚Äôve saved me a ton of times and opened up my favorite cities in ways I didn‚Äôt expect | I love this app! Have used it for 2 trips now. I love that it gives a description of most places that are available to visit and the opening/closing times are very helpful to plan an itinerary. It‚Äôs great. | I was so in love with the Google Trips app and then they discontinued it. This has everything the Google Trips app had and SO MUCH MORE! It‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs exactly what I would build if I made a travel app. Recommendations but also the flexibility to easily add your own options. Integrated map with your locations. Day schedules. Walking time between attractions. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs free. I love it so much!";4.83524;12212;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/92/46/60/9246600a-4b7e-e027-1d01-171b02e2858a/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/00/68/d5/0068d5e5-a33c-8f47-2915-06a8fc359ead/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/45/54/6d/45546d76-18d6-04a6-4db2-a0883ecbd0f0/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8f/0e/98/8f0e986b-914b-9033-df61-30f2e675025b/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/59/69/fe/5969fe14-4ba0-f6fd-79e8-f7a723c35227/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/52/55/98/52559869-004f-781d-91a8-3146ae61c1bb/35d69598-c4b9-45e5-a688-715ddba9d84e_01.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a2/e9/65/a2e96501-041f-7bcf-2357-7d321ac28f47/dad1e9ec-073c-4719-aa75-9bd31a5915e6_02.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/19/d6/1c/19d61c84-360f-20a7-7b0e-c35aa3d3dfab/9a333c80-48a2-40e4-9616-30c4bff16f9d_03.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/da/00/5e/da005e87-e856-6518-5658-b1fdbe747ef7/ed646e62-51c0-4a95-b1c1-457728de0bc3_04.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/77/3a/04/773a043b-c234-3502-908f-d86941694dc2/6ca9456e-2c4c-4b0c-98de-f067c05b3a16_05.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Nancy Probizanski | Best place to find the best food around !!! | The man who was working there was beyond helpful. Excellent customer service with a smile. I hope you give him a shoutout. | Yelp would be better if fake reviews were litigated and people who post fake review get banned. | Truly one of my favorite apps, however, every single time I click out of the app to either send it to someone if I‚Äôm getting an incoming call if I‚Äôm getting an incoming text message and decide to respond to it, it takes me back to the loading page and it‚Äôs so incredibly infuriating. Please fix it to where every time I click out of the app. I don‚Äôt have to go back and start from Ground Zero. | I was far less then impressed walking through a curtains entering the restaurant 
The staff wasn‚Äôt very cordial receiving us to sit us 
I think they think they are much more than they are 
The food was ok
The quantity of the Gnocchi was a joke
I thought if you have to sell your bread to your customers maybe you should open a bakery | Great location, great service, easy parking.
Food was good but not great for the price.
Pizza was excellent, the leek and pea soup was ok, lacked flavor, at least you would expect some bacon flavor in this soup but none to be found and the portion size was unexceptional.
Portion sizes on our orders was so small that we were still hungry when we left so we made some spaghetti when we got home. We are not gluttons, but the serving sizes were minuscule. This food reminds me of a French restaurant where they make the food look pretty but don‚Äôt give you much for quite a bit of money. | I couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw it on the menu! Moved here from Charlotte in October 2023 and just discovered that Greensboro has the steak bagel, bisquit or McMuffin just the way I like tender hot and fresh! | Yelp makes it impossible to view waitlists on the mobile web browser. Forcing you to download their app. | Quick and very attentive service! The portion sizes are great and the fish is very fresh, my favorite sushi spot. | Already Know | Apparently can‚Äôt do 0 Stars
Don‚Äôt use either.  Just reordered probably for 5th or 6th a Taco Salad from Door Dash App from Mexican Post. Order arrived without protein on other orders and Mexican Post blamed me for not selecting protein even though every other reorder included it without issue even though App didn‚Äôt ask for it. Reorder generally means order same thing where I come from. Young lady very polite.  come and get ground beef or take it up with Door Dash.  Apparently it is customer responsibility to make things right. | 1. Asked for water,  didn‚Äôt received, 
2 . Received orders with missing food, 
3. Asked waitress, was told only kitchen brings out and orders up to kitchen staff to get it right,  
4. Notified Management and still orders not corrected. 
Warning stay away,  Service terrible but food was good | SideBar accepted Doordash order. Dasher arrived to find out SideBar was having a party and would not fulfill order. Dasher called very apologetic. I called SideBar and spoke to the manager and asked why the order was accepted. The manager was extremely unhelpful and could of cared less about the situation. I will not order again. Too bad because the food is very good. | Muy rica la comida y el personal super | Decent app lets u look up the spots while traveling, that are 5 stars or not, for food, parks or hotels | Restaurant in Barrado Lima Peru. Outstanding food in a small shopping area. Fresh ceviche, chicha and friendly service. Prices are great. Most tender mahi mahi.  Grilled oyster to die for | I just left a training and wanted a pizza.   Because I didn‚Äôt want to drive pass my house I googled pizza in Annandale, Va.  I saw Casa D‚ÄôMama Pizzeria and thought, this might be good.  When I walked in because of the atmosphere I felt like I was in a Latino restaurant instead of a pizzeria.  I was still hopeful that it would be tasty.  When I got home I reheated the pizza a little bit, just to warm it.   This was the worse excuse for a pizza I have ever had.  It had no flavor and very little sauce. This was more like cheese bread.   Definitely was not worth the $16 I paid for it.  I will not eat here again and will not recommend it for a pizza. | The closest thing to a day care center I have ever dined at! #daycarecenter | The cashier forgot to give me the toy I bought. My daughter was so excited about it and I didn‚Äôt realize until I got home that it wasn‚Äôt in the bag. I called over and over and over again and no one answered the phone so I ended up driving by at 730 because their hours said they closed at 8. Well it was already closed when I drove by. So the next morning I called and called again and no one answered so I decided to stop by again because at this point, I was mad. I get there and the employees were nice but once the manager came out she said sorry there‚Äôs nothing we can do because they couldn‚Äôt find the toy but the manager said she had seen it that morning. I knew someone had probably bought it. It wasn‚Äôt u til I had to get a little tough when she said ‚Äúwell I can make an exception this one time‚Äù and I got to pick another toy but it wasn‚Äôt the same thing. My daughter loved that toy.  I‚Äôm still so mad that they could be that irresponsible! | Yelp you always help me find food like jinya. | I‚Äôve been in this bakery for a few times and I enjoy with the fresh sandwich, croissant, and a lot good variety. I am recommended to buy here. | The reviews are weird and often irrelevant. Good luck trying to access it through their website all you get is a bunch of redirects to the App Store trying to get you to download the app without telling you that‚Äôs what they want you to do. Considering the weird and useless reviews you get on the app and website it seems to me this company is in its death throes. Don‚Äôt waste your valuable time. It ain‚Äôt worth it. | Jackie is an awesome hairdresser .... men's haircut and a great hair washer... | Once I have booked a trip whether business or pleasure one of the next things I do is head straight to Yelp.  I find the best spots and and the awesome  thing is I have yet to be disappointed. I respect that people help me make my best memories by steering me to the highly rated places. I save a lot of time looking for things once I arrive and have more time  enjoying the scenery instead of searching for what to do.  I highly recommend you use Yelp to assist in planning a dinner night or entire vacation. | I love Yelp as it‚Äôs my go to when I‚Äôm looking for new spots to check out. ALWAYS! I rely on my fellow Yelpers or business pages to guide me. Love seeing new spots and bookmarking accordingly. 

Being an Elite has been so rewarding. This is a whole community of like-minded people aka Phone Eats First and no judgment zone. Ahhhhh, it‚Äôs quite amazing. Love all the friends I‚Äôve met through Yelp, whether it‚Äôs online or in person, it really is a community.

We are lucky to have such a wonderful and committed Community Manager in Mia R. for the Fort Lauderdale community. We have been lucky enough to do so many cool events throughout the years!

Regarding the Yelp mobile app and desktop version, there are definitely some inconsistencies that don‚Äôt always make it easy to Yelp. I noticed there are several things you can do on the mobile app but not on a desktop. For instance, you can see tips at businesses on the phone but not on desktop.

Noticed more recently in the past few weeks, Yelp removed compliments and firsts which were always my go to sections. Firsts are just gone, kaput. That was fun to contribute to because I love sharing new businesses or tips when I can. Tips are what I look at for quick references. And photos. If I‚Äôm serious about a spot then I‚Äôll scope the reviews. I also noticed you can see the compliments on a desktop but your phone is most convenient when you‚Äôre on the go all the time. Please, for the love of Yelp‚Ä¶bring back the compliments and firsts! Many of my friends thrived on sharing compliments with fellow Yelpers.

When you write a review and upload photos, it only limits you to 10 photos total. Why?!? But if you upload photos first and it allows you to upload 10 at a time, then it eventually adds all of those photos to an associated review. You can add up to 10 at a time, that‚Äôs just annoying. Google Reviews allow you to add as many photos as possible and it uploads super fast. That‚Äôs another thing, uploading photos to Yelp whenever it be check-ins, tips or reviews‚Ä¶it takes FOREVERRRRRR!!! It would be nice to upload as many photos as possible all at once. Time saver!

One last thing and then I‚Äôm out, sometimes when I compliment friends on their activity or photos, there is a glitch and the compliment doesn‚Äôt always attach to the photo so then the person doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs happens to me as well when others compliment my photos and I can‚Äôt tell what they are referencing to. Then we have no idea what they are talking about. Ha.

Thank you Yelp for existing and helping us find new local businesses to support. | Went there for a singles activity. Waited for over an hour after orders were placed. One of our group was told that being a bigger group, they were prioritizing the smaller groups.  Food was a 4. Service was a -. It took 25 min to get a water refill after I asked for a refill. Then, they tried to charge an automatic 18% gratuity since we were ‚Äúsitting together‚Äù without telling us. Some of them had left tips on the table. I am generally a 20%+ tipper when the service is good. After speaking to the manager, my tip was returned.  I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll ever go back‚Ä¶, but definitely not with a group. | I can no longer see the Review Of The Day in my nearby feed. Is there a way to click on a button for the ROTD and past Rotd? I only knew I got one when I recieved compliments but I also would like to be able to compliment others. I have an iPhone iOS version 17.3.1 | Food was amazing really gave off the Hawaiian vibe. Great customer service. I definitely recommend it one of the greatest fast food experiences I‚Äôve ever had | While on vacation in Tucson, Arizona we ate at Alejandro.  The food and service were both excellent!  Best burritos that I have ever had!  Also half price house margarita was very good too. | Loved it here - comfy local feel with delicious food.  You wouldn‚Äôt know it from the road but go have some lunch or dinner! | Wow!!!  What a gr8 place to have physical therapy AND occupational therapy!!!

I want to thank Curtis, Steve, Geoff and Zach!  You all are very knowledgeable, helpful, caring and aware about me working on having better physical health!!!  I‚Äôm independent now and am blessed to be able to continue my workouts, circuits and PT through a company that ACTUALLY CARES about ME!!!  I have been continuing my workouts for months now and once I got to know everyone, you are like family!  We laugh, tell our testimonies and have lunch and class on Fridays still!

What a GREAT institution of knowledge in a workplace of professionals‚Ä¶THANK YOU!!! | As a child, I was taught that if you can‚Äôt say something nice, then don‚Äôt say anything at all. Yelp has helped me with my choices. I generally trust the reviewers on Yelp; yes, every now and then we all have bad experiences. But by and large, most decent food places won‚Äôt stay in business with bad food, poor service, and an unpleasant atmosphere. Reviewers generally get it right, which is why I trust Yelp. | Worst Chinese food I have ever ordered and tried to eat. Egg rolls soo dry. Rice tasteless. | Horrible delivery service.People on phone are impossible. Will never order them again. Took food to neighbors. Not worked it out. | Me encanto comer all√° s√∫per servicio y ambiente y la atenci√≥n y el servicio  Estrella | I love Yelp because I‚Äôm able to share my dining experiences and much more! I can find a plumber , a painter , great food and deserts! This app has allowed me to be a tiny voice in a large community! I love being a YELPER!! | My boyfriend uses Yelp religiously and now I turn to the app, too, for places to eat. | I am a builder. I went to Lamps Plus in West Hollywood to purchase one item. The sales Lady ended up selling me 8 items. (Armin√©) good for her. üòÇ

I wish they had more modern and sleek looking choices. Someone should send them a Memo that we are in 2024. 

Having said that, they are extremely helpful and efficient. | I have always relied on the excellent services at Oak Haven Massage since I began long  ago.  I was so impressed with the standard of skill Dr Shuel required from his therapist, plus on going training provided and encouraged by connecting levels of training with compensation .  
I also am in awe of the staff at Oak Haven.  They truly are the absolutely best trained and best customer service people any where!üòç 

I‚Äôve often thought businesses should look at this staff for any prospective recruiting for their own business.  

The One and only Problem I have encountered after years as a customer is this:

I automatically pay monthly for a membership.   Since my travel causes me to not always be able to use the monthly massage I appreciate credits accruing for later use.

HOWEVER, today I‚Äôm tried to allow my two daughters to use.1 crept each for a massage I was then told this is a ONCE A YEAR ONLY courtesy  so it will be the last time I can offer this to my daughters this year. ( they are flight attendants and can really use these )

I CANNOT USE MY CREDITS ( $$ of mine that Oak Haven has had in their banks ( interest and reported profit) for months since my payments accumulate in their bank before I can often use it.) 
 There is a definite an advantage for Oak Haven in using monthly memberships for their financial gain by not only accumulation of $$ in accounts BUT IN PUSHING FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS ?Who MIGHT HAVE RECEIVE A KID GIFT) TO BUY THEIr OWN MASSAGES RATHER THAN RECEIVE A KIND GIFT FROM THE MEMBER 
( And I might add: This world can use all the kindness it can get) THEREFORE GAINING MORE  PAID CUSTOMERS OR POSSIBLE RECRUITED MEMBERSHIPS THAN A KIND GIFT BY A MEMBER.

A MISS OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC RELATIONS!!

I‚Äôm not against marketing for any company!!  After all  they r there to make money BUT Not AT THE COST OF LOYAL CUSTOMERS WHO ARE WILLING TO COMMIT  A MONTHLY PAYMENT REGARDLESS WHETHER THEY IT IS REDEEMED THAT MONTH OR NOT.

If this kind of ‚ÄúUSUAL business greed‚Äùcontinues I will be withdrawing my membership.   I really considered this company better than that.  Please reconsider your unkind money in your ‚ÄúMEMBERSHIP‚Äù. | Use the app often especially when traveling. I would love to see a map for each of my collections. Then I can judge how far my saved locations are from my hotel. 

Thanks. | My business Climate Creations had a bipolar person leave a review of my company without researching any facts
I sent inspection report issued by local authorities to dispute claim made by this psychotic individual and they would not remove review after many attempts to have it removed 
I have found a lawyer to sue Robert J Buechler for defamation and once found guilty I‚Äôm hoping yelp will remove the lies concerning my business 
It is remarkable how many lies will be allowed | I had the best experience, the best cleaning and the best hygienist I have ever had   Thank you | So almost didn‚Äôt try this place based off a couple bad reviews. Someone complained that they received poor service because of the language barrier and said they got taken advantage of. My experience was quite different, I was looking at the menu and got overwhelmed-nothing looked familiar so I almost left. The order taker must have noticed and came over to where I was sitting and went thru every page on the menu and explained all the food dishes. I ordered a couple to go meals and he personally packed my bag and put in some extra sauces that he said I need to try. I thanked him and he wish me well and shook my hand. I got home to find out that the food was just as good as the service. Both mine and my wife‚Äôs meals were delicious and the sauce that he put in we could have drank that stuff. Will be back for sure! | Thank you Naomi for the great customer service. We will definitely be back to visit you again. Thank you from the sweeper crew . City of San Antonio | Deleted. Back to browser jail you go. So sleazy. | Every single time I open a link in an article it opens just fine in the browser but when I am forced to the app it ALWAYS takes me to the download and then NEVER links to the list or place I am trying to get more information on. Then I go to contact support and that is just a list of issues they already fixed. So sad to see this once decent app go downhill. | I have never been to the Broadway Market! Either has my kids and they are in their 20‚Äôs.  I hear a lot about it! Good and bad! I look at the good and I can take the bad!! My son is visiting and I think it would be a great time! Positive is what I am! I will write my review after we have gone. I am looking forward to it! We both are! ü§ó | Heaviest garlic ever ‚Äî and i have had a pizza 10 times before.  The printed menu is different than the online menu.  They are amateur pizza makers that have abandoned their award-winning roots.   Rookies.  Next they even served an IPA instead of the Triple Belgium Macadamia nut they advertise. (Assumed the customer would not notice) Maybe they are resting on their laurels from their award winning start.    It is a slippery slope of decline they are on.   They started out quality but have abandoned their heritage.  What happened to the delicious balanced pizza they used to serve. | There is a short bartender that thinks he is all that. But little does he know he is a rude jerk. I asked him if I could it a tshirt and he told me he was to busy to bother with me. I would fire this man if it was up to me. I am on vacation and my experience with OTT was not very pleasant.

Highly recommend people use their service especially traveling Asia | KLOOK is the way to go if you want to organize your trip in advance.

Thanks , KLOOK! | Site is user friendly for an old dog like me üê∂ | I find the app extremely easy to use | Great service. | Although this app has a lot of good deals they also allow shady businesses apart of their app. We booked a hotel room stay for one night and on my statement it said I check in March 3rd and check out March 4th. We get to the hotel and the front desk tells us we only have the room for 2 hours and wants to upcharge us but on my statement it clearly says that I am booked for march 3rd check in and check out March 4th. The receptionist leaves to the back and never comes back out so we can‚Äôt even talk to anyone. We wait over 2 hours to speak to someone while also trying to get ahold of Klook only for them to tell us they can‚Äôt refund us because it‚Äôs the day of and my mistake.. What do you mean ??? We wasted 2 hours waiting to speak to the receptionist at the hotel and used ZERO of their services and they continue to allow business like this on their app. Be CAREFUL. | Lies and false information from Klook and then no refund. | As expected I sent them the whole story of what‚Äôs happened in the link they pretended to provide (like they care). Nope! over a week after, nothing happens, not even an acknowledge or pretend like they are working on the case. Truly, a sad customer support! Previous: This was my first time using Klook, as they seem popular in Asia. I booked a car rental, but in the confirmation email, it stated that refunds were not available on the day of the rental. I attempted to cancel my reservation one day prior, but Klook refused to issue a refund and instead suggested to a full charge. Unfortunately, there was no clear explanation about refund policies or fees prior to the rental date. Despite multiple attempts to contact their call center, I was never given a satisfactory answer about the language used in the confirmation email or why a refund was not possible, the reps were just simply ‚Äúno refund, bye‚Äù and didn‚Äôt bother to read my further questions. | I just used klook to schedule airport pickup in Hanoi, VN.  The site asked me for my flight info but didn‚Äôt realize it set the date for Feb 27 default (that‚Äôs tomorrow).  I needed the pickup for March 9th.  I realized the mistake and engaged them immediately.  They said there‚Äôs nothing they can do to cancel.  There is a 24 hour before pickup free cancellation but due to Vietnam being 12 hours ahead of the US, I was already within that 24 hour before I ever booked because of the auto date they set.  

This is a terrible way to do business. And I will not be using them again. | Very easy to navigate and all the tours we had are perfect. | Very easy to navigate thru the app. A one stop for all your train rides and experiences to purchase tickets and have all your information in one place. | I couldn‚Äôt find the booking confirmation on my email. I asked for help from Klook live chat. Muhammad A found my booking information and resent it to me. I still couldn‚Äôt locate it on the inbox. He sent me a pdf attachment with the live chat so that I could download it. He is one of the best costumer specialist I have luckily had!

We booked a car rental, but in the confirmation email, it stated that refunds were not available on the day of the rental. We attempted to cancel my reservation one day prior, but Klook refused to issue a refund and instead suggested to a full charge. Unfortunately, there was no clear explanation about refund policies or fees prior to the rental date. Despite multiple attempts to contact their call center, we were never given a satisfactory answer about the language used in the confirmation email or why a refund was not possible, the reps were just simply ‚Äúno refund, bye‚Äù and didn‚Äôt bother to read our further questions. | I had booked tickets for gardens by the bay in Singapore. My husbands flight was delayed by 14 hours and I had reached out to the customer support to provide refund/credits so that we can see in the 5 days of trip planned. They had promised to provide refund and needed the details of the flight delay etc. when I reached out and provided, it was routed to more ‚Äúsenior specialists‚Äù and they kept chatting and asking for same proofs and that they will get back to me. While I waited, I also rebooked and saw the gardens by the bay because the agent had said if they can‚Äôt provide refund, they will give us credits if we rebook. I had faith on them. However, in the end, they still route me to different specialists and still are ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù and now say that it‚Äôs an ‚Äúopen ticket‚Äù and I can use it for 3 months. It‚Äôs useless solution for me as it was provided after I left Singapore. Extremely unprofessional and will never use Klook again. Please avoid and do not use if you ever think you might have changes to your original booking and might need help. They clearly will not help. | The Klook app is extremely user unfriendly and exceedingly difficult to use. I booked a tour trip in SE Asia for 5 people costing over $750 USD. No communication, no confirmation of pick up time or place, no way to contact the tour operator or Klook. I am extremely unhappy and very frustrated. Will never use Klook again. The user experience with Trip Advisor is so much smoother and straightforward. I have never had this type of issue with them. | App is easy to use and order restaur tickets | Good rates | I got scammed by app! No one respond from team and no one help. Was book for 17 dec but app itself confirmed 15 Dec instead 17! No one refound money or apologize. Also, I was try to book for 2 people but app give me options for 3 only‚Ä¶..after many attempt I got registered 2 people ‚Ä¶.. So, be careful, the app is not working correct and team are not supportive.So bad experience unfortunately:( | First time booked thru Klook.  Very easy, simple, fast, transparent and no hidden fees when paid with Apple Pay.  Will definitely use this app again.  I highly recommend this app to those who are visiting Thailand. | Klook purported to buy a ticket for me on the high speed train from Kyoto to Tokyo. But when I arrived in Kyoto, there was no ticket for me to pick up. Klook then refused to refund my purchase, even though they did not contest the mistake was on their end. They are thieves and scammers. Avoid. | Soo Very much helpful app ever!! | Booked several train tickets for Japan. Payment went through and booking was confirmed. 3 hours later got a notice that my booking had been canceled. No explanation. And I have to wait for the refund. Absolutely rubbish. | È¢ÑÂÆöÂíåÈÄÄÊ¨æÈÉΩÂæàÂÆπÊòìÔºåÈùûÂ∏∏Êé®Ëçêüëçüëç | Very fast, convenient tip top üëçüèª | My girlfriend and I bought tickets to Fuji-Q for a day they were supposed to be opened but they weren't. We asked for a refund they asked for proof but when we showed proof they still didn't refund us the money and told us the ticket is good for 90 days meanwhile by the time they got back to us we're already back home from Japan. We can't do anything with this ticket and they won't honor the proof we sent them. Hate customer service like this | They always have amazing deals and let you know what kinda cool and fun stuff there is to do in the areas you are looking for! | Love how details the instructions are when booking something. The instructions include step by step details with photos for each step.
We have booked tours, train tickets on Klook for Taiwan and Japan. It‚Äôs been great! | This application has changed the way I travel! Its so much easier to find activities and book them before going to the destination. I absolutely love klook and recommend it to anyone who is traveling abroad! | Absolutely no confirmation on bookings, in their apps it states confirmation will be sent within 48 hrs for Disney. Will not be using them for any future bookings on any trips. | Needed this app to purchase Disney Tokyo tickets- hopefully no issues when we travel there next week! The process buying felt secure and easy. | Always travel with Klook! Every single one is so easy and so cheap! Makes traveling so so easy | Very disappointed, I was trying to applied my first time user discount and I couldn‚Äôt. | √Åp r·∫•t ti·ªán l·ª£i, v√† c√≥ nhi·ªÅu ch∆∞∆°ng tr√¨nh gi·∫£m gi√° | Easy navigating, reasonable price and excellent customer service.

I too highly recommend this app. I have had an overall wonderful experience with the app. Not only was I able to find hostels in *most* all the areas I wanted, I was also able to find things to do in the surrounding areas, at great prices might I add too. The only downside to the app on my end is I keep running into latency issues and app crashes. I have tried restarting the app and changing VPN settings and even turning my VPN off, ensuring the app is up to date, etc etc. the app still tends to lag a bit at random when my connect is fine otherwise on every other app in my phone. Then every now and then the app will crash. I still highly recommend this app, however, looking forward to figuring out this latency and crashing issue at some point. | Absolutely nuts trying to get any help with their product. I only use as a last resort. For the love of god, do not change your email address with them. They make it so hard. | Es un buen aplicativo seguro confiable que te brinda muchas opciones. | Nonstop popup notifications from chat rooms inside the app! | If a very poorly rated hostel gets a single 10 star review in a 6month period than that hostel will show up as 10 stars. You need to be very aware of what you are booking and read the reviews because it could appear as a 10 star hostel when in actuality they are as low as a 5 or 6 star (these are always dirty and disgusting even though hostelworld describes a hostel with a ‚Äúfailing‚Äù rating as ‚Äúgood‚Äù). So this makes the booking process more complicated instead of easier and puts you at great risk | I‚Äôve been with HW since its early days and have always supported the ease of booking through them. Lately their customer service seems to be going downhill and their turning into a megacorp. It is sad to see but seems true after my recent interactions with them. They make it more difficult to contact them and try to give you boilerplate responses‚Ä¶ book directly with properties when you can. | I have been trying to get a hold of hostel world staff about a reservation. There‚Äôs no number to call and they are quick to end the conversation over email. I will not be booking with this app again, I will be booking directly with the hostel. I am outraged with how poorly the communication works through this app. | I haven‚Äôt stayed yet | Makes life easier, more efficient and trusted for hostels.. the best | Started a dispute for a $400 charge to my account, they literally left me hanging with my request, and the hostel didnt even bother to reach out | I tried to change the dates of my trip (reduce the days) and hostelworld does not give me the option to change the dates, only cancel outright. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm about to be out hundreds of dollars.. | A website pops up after pressing the login button and there‚Äôs nowhere to put your username and password. Really embarassing | Easy to book great hostels. | So far easy to use and well organized | The cellular app doesn‚Äôt let me select Lets Go after I add how many guests | Don‚Äôt bother - booked wrong room and denied it even tho the room they said I booked had a different price and didn‚Äôt agree with what hostel said I booked. Also found same room for less with flexible terms and breakfast for less on booking They literally don‚Äôt care | Great app! Works all over the place! | Very user friendly and very descriptive. Reviews are key and even has a chat for travelers. | Cheap prices but they do not care about their customers! If you get unlucky and something happens, don‚Äôt count on them, even if you‚Äôre a loyal customer. Twice they let me down. The first: a hostel asked me to email them my card info before arrival despite making a deposit through Hostelworld. I‚Äôve stayed at dozens of hostels and was never asked for my card info prior to arrival. It seemed suspicious, so I asked them to have HostelWorld notify me directly if an action is needed. Instead, they canceled my reservation a few days before I arrived and HostelWorld wouldn‚Äôt refund my deposit. I had to book another place for 2x the price due to short notice. Second: Myself and two others were robbed within 1 week in the same hostel. I was robbed twice. The reception could have been more helpful by looking at hallway footage but said it would take too long! I left a factual & honest review for the hostel, warning others of the theft in respectful language, and HostelWorld deleted my review. | Hostel Makes a small globe comfortable and affordable. What more could one ask for? Happy New Year! | When I try to login via the app it redirects me to page to download app‚Ä¶then nothing happens | My reservations on Hostelworld app don‚Äôt show up later on the app.
I do receive an email from H confirming the reservation and another email from the hostel confirming the reservation. | I‚Äôve had the time of my life every time I‚Äôve traveled to Europe and Israel thanks to the easy and clean way to find accommodations! Thank again for all the help! | Every time I open the app it opens the browser and redirects me to the App Store. It‚Äôs annoying. | I have used this app in the early days and I still found it easy to use it‚Äôs platform! Over the years it has helped me so much to meet new people and see what‚Äôs around the area. Super helpful for solo Travelers and group travelers. A good heads up is that when you book anything here, it‚Äôs only reserving the space note that you will have to pay the rest when you check in. | why is the chat feature not working? nothing is loading | I keep getting redirected to redownload the app on the sign up page and when i click the link to ‚Äúopen app‚Äù it takes me to the app store. when i click the ‚Äúopen‚Äù option in the app store it takes me back to the same to options to ‚Äúdownload app from app store‚Äù or ‚Äúopen app‚Äù. it‚Äôs very frustrating since i‚Äôm trying to book something soon. | Great except for the utter lack of customer support these days. They seem to have axed the entire department and rely almost solely on automated emails pre-written responses in their help section. Good luck if you have any real issues. Booking 3rd party means any and all issues have to go through their customer support rather than the hostel‚Äôs. So youre boned if you need help | Pois eles indicam gosteis p√©ssimos na foto √© uma coisa mas a realidade outra | Thank you so much for making it easy to find last minute accommodation | Unfair booking policy‚Äôs with a hard to navigate app. Basically selected the correct dates however the app for some reason booked for the wrong month. Canceled minutes later however the fee was non refundable. I would recommend using hostel world to look at hostel reviews then googling the hostel and booking directly to save on the fee that Hostelworld charges. | Having the worst time of my life getting ahold of customer service to cancel my reservation and it won‚Äôt pop up in the app‚Ä¶ sooo??? | If in Denver, do it! Comfy beds, great staff, super clean and everything you need | The app is very slow and glitchy. Other than that the app is great | I have never been let down/disappointed by Hostelworld. From Israel to Thailand to Rome, I‚Äôve had consistently good experiences booking with ease through Hostelworld. Other travelers leave useful reviews and pictures are consistent with the actual hostels. I highly recommend this app, even for people who usually stay in hotels as sometimes private rooms in hostels are just as nice! | Why? | Won‚Äôt let me sign in, any attempt to create an account is not working either. | ‰∏≠‰ªãÂÖ¨Âè∏Ôºå‰∏çËÉΩÂèñÊ∂à‰∏çËÉΩÊîπÈ¢ÑÂÆö„ÄÇÁúüÁâõ | I have been using this for years but my last reservation was unpleasant. Both the hostel (Podshare Los Angeles) and the booking details in the Hostelworld app stated that CHARGES DUE UPON ARRIVAL (except for the Hostelworld fee which is billed as a deposit up front in order to secure reservation). I was charged in full by the hostel the same day. I have screenshots. Hostelworld customer service was useless and so was Podshare. | Ive tried logging in a million times, this app is a nightmare!!! It just keeps taking me back to the app store to download the app which i was already on in the first place!!!!!!!!!!! I even updated my phone thinking that could be the problem but no this app is just ridiculous | The app is extremely slow and buggy. It takes a few seconds to load anything in the app which can be extremely annoying when just checking things quickly. Lots of performance issues. When you open up a page of who is staying at your hostel, it must try and load every single person in the list at once rather than lazy loading. So, when I try to view a list of the 80 people staying at my hostel, the app freezes for a good 30 seconds before even showing the list. The messaging functionality is also extremely buggy and every chat is filled with ‚ÄúIs anyone else solo traveling?‚Äù, followed by a message like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to send that‚Äù because everyone accidentally hits the quick chat things. | Messaging functionality is extremely buggy. Jittery scrolling, slow loading of messages. It‚Äôs almost unusable. Otherwise a great app | Wish I could use the app but it won‚Äôt allow me to sign in, even after deleting and reinstalling. I contacted customer service but they said they don‚Äôt know what the problem is. | I‚Äôm new to international travel, and to hostels as well. This app takes the hassle out of finding a suitable place to stay, regardless of what you‚Äôre looking for. Hostelworld‚Äôs straightforward user interface and built-in social network make it fun to use as well. I can easily connect with other travelers with similar interests wherever I go. This app willinstantly add value to your travel experience! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Best value | This is a great resource to start off your search for hostels in wherever part of the world you‚Äôll be traveling in. But after that, just book at the actual hostel‚Äôs website. It‚Äôs a few more clicks (and i believe the shrugging you might have) but you‚Äôll save yourself a few bucks. Who knows, that what my takeaway would be üò≠ | When first opening app, it ask questions/permissions that I am not yet comfortable in giving. I want to browse the app first, to see if I should trust it at all. It won't let me see anything after selecting $ for currency, without me logging in to give it more info?

Once we finally got to Schipol in Amsterdam. My husband helped a lady with 3 small children get off the train. The Eurostar staff sat and watched while my husband used the weight of his body to stop the train doors from closing while this poor mom tried to get her family off the train. Why on earth would you have staff who sits there and laughs. Absolutely mortified as this transpired. No one was willing to help. My husband is now bruised and I‚Äôm thoroughly disgusted in Eurostars willingness not to help. Shame on all of you
Train #9937 coach #32 | The app wont let you rebook our train so we are stuck in Calais after 10 hours of nightmare travel. 0 communication from the company and wont offer any form of payment for accommodation we had to get. One of the most frustrating and disappointing companies I have ever booked with. Will not be using this terrible app or company again. | This app is really annoying. It doesn‚Äôt allow to select Paris as a departure city. Not in Search, nor shows in recent (although I have already made bookings previously) nor in popular, or alphabetical... 
The work around is to select Brussels, after select Paris as your destination and reverse the travel traject. 
Why is it not possible to make such a simple action as selecting whatever available city, possible?  Annoying! | I am locked out of my account when I tried to verify through my email and still not get in. I need to buy my tickets so this is a big let down | Just lost all my booking history on the app ‚Ä¶ This app is so bad !!! | When selecting departure time of your ticket it doesn‚Äôt tell you how early you need to arrive. Only after purchasing it says 90 minutes and so on. I‚Äôm a first time traveler on this train and I had no idea. And I cannot make it there before 90 minutes.. a warning before ticket purchase would have prompted me to book a later train. Please improve it | And terrible signage | Doesn‚Äôt let me book a trip at the original price I wanted due to ‚Äútechnical error, try again later‚Äù. I submit a complaint form online and never get a confirmation that it was created. Contact customer service and they say they can‚Äôt do anything despite me having a screenshot of the error. Fix your app and people wouldn‚Äôt be calling or complaining as much. Part 2: just tried booking another train ticket through the app, had a ticket in my cart and then the app glitched out and when I went to go purchase again the prince went up !! And it would give me an error to make the booking even when my details were right. HORRIBLE APP | Why not??!! | Email with tickets contains ticket number.
App requests booking reference!
Not user friendly not having info presented in
one place! | We are a family of 5 and our train from
Amsterdam to London was cancelled due to weather. We have been trying for several days to get assistance and request a refund. We had to rent a car and drive to Brussels to make our next destination a day late. The app itself is circular with information and no solutions or formal communication about how to reconcile this issue. Very frustrating! | Why? | Can‚Äôt access tickets thru app.  Can‚Äôt save tickets to Apple wallet. | The app just closes.. does nothing‚Ä¶ tried to delete it and re download.. still does not work .. 
was working fine until a day ago | See above | Eurostar is in the business of ripping off unsuspecting tourists. It‚Äôs a business designed to extort as much money from you as they can. You‚Äôre better off flying. There‚Äôs very little upside.  The food is disgusting and the servers seem hostile towards the passengers. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this SCAM organization. We didn‚Äôt not have a set cut-off time on our tickets, got to the station with 30+ minutes before the train was to depart‚Äîbut they said we‚Äôd only be allowed on the train if we paid them $750. So, if we paid more money, we hadn‚Äôt missed the train, but $300 tickets‚Äîand we ‚Äúmissed‚Äù the train?!?!? Airlines do not do this!! I still had to pay another $350 to leave 3 hours later. I‚Äôm disgusted with Eurostar and will NEVER consider booking anything with them again. | Couldn‚Äôt book travel initially.  Then can‚Äôt choose seats.  Not impressed. | Using same login has to enter booking code to synch. Should have been automatic. | is a dream take this for travel France-London | I made a mistake and bought 2 tickets for me and my wife, but both in my name. Our last name is the same. I need to change the first name on my wife‚Äôs ticket. I can not find how to correct the mistake. | Very difficult to navigate | I‚Äôve used this app for years without any problems. This morning, 13th Feb 2023, it updated itself, and now with the new version it is unusable: opens for a split second then crashes and quits. I‚Äôve restarted my phone, but still doesn‚Äôt work. | Kept changing Birthday. Ugg | Super easy to use!! | I used this app a lot when I was in Europe in 2022. It works very well and has a good UI. It‚Äôs also very handy when using multiple rail companies. Just a word of caution: Always check to see if you can book directly with the railway or other companies. For example, I travel in France a lot. If I use this app for my wife and I to take the train from London to Paris it‚Äôs $50 more than booking with the SNCF app (same day, time, seats, class, etc). Also, it‚Äôs non-refundable using this app. Just an FYI. | Purchasing tickets as an American who hasn‚Äôt been to Europe in many years. Very easy app to use | The website, app, and customer service is an embarrassment.  Our train was cancelled.  NOT at all easy to reschedule without losing more time off your trip and/or paying fees.  The US number is disconnected, and nobody ever responded to five emails sent six weeks ago.  The trip has come and gone without any acknowledgement of our issues.  Total disappointment! | My trip was cancelled- accepted the new itinerary with a pre selected seat availability- seating in a set of 4 is very uncomfortable - specially if you are tall- 
Food is 2 pieces of bread -butter - oj- yogurt-
If you take the early schedule know that most people are business people and they could be on a phone call and clicking on a key board the entire 3.5 hour trip- trip is advertised as 2.5 hour from London to Paris - we left at 8:00 and arrived in Paris at 11:30. | I must have tried to book my tickets 15 times with my US card, failure each time. I have had to borrow money from a friend‚Äôs card to pay for these stupid tickets. Simply terrible. And bad customer service too, slow to reply pond and useless when they do. | The best and fastest way to go Paris ! | We received great service in London and Paris well beyond everything we expected | While the app works great for bookings and selection of seats during  booking, if they change your seats because of an equipment change the app shows your original seat selection 

This was a problem because during check in at the station, the new receipt only printed on half the paper    This meant you couldn‚Äôt read the new car or seat number.  The station equipment issue isn‚Äôt a problem the app can fix but the app should have reflected the new car/seat assignments 
Had to track down a station attendant for assistance 

Fix this issue and 5 stars | I just traveled with my 6 year old to Rotterdam, although the train was late outbound it was still a smooth trip. The train team were really friendly and helpful changing our seats as my son gets travel sick going backwards.it‚Äôs such an east way to travel to so many destinations. Thanks Eurostar. | Not sure if this works as seee no text. Crazy bad site app. Worst in world.  Can‚Äôt reset password or register. Uselesss | Finding help on this app is a nightmare! I‚Äôm trying to cancel a trip I‚Äôve rolled forward already due to COVID travel restrictions that existed in France and I‚Äôm getting a message to contact my travel agent (I bought direct from Eurostar) and I can‚Äôt find a number to call for help! | The boy to answer questions on Eurostar webpage or app does not work, very frustrating.

Train travel and service are otherwise excellent, but good luck on getting answers to your questions. | I had changed my destination location and the agent from Eurostar stated they would email a voucher for this trip. They did not do this and I have tried emailing Eurostar multiple times and they never respond. They encourage you to do everything on the internet but their website does not make it possible. Very poor customer service. | Delays one way, more delays coming back and the app doesn‚Äôt keep up real time. Surely, ‚Äúincidents‚Äù on the track can be related in a more timely manner. Regardless, it seems the journeys‚Äô timing are increasingly unreliable. | App does not seem to work, the destinations don‚Äôt load on the bookings page | I tried to book online and I pressed the buy now button and nothing registered. I uploaded the app to my phone and the tickets came through to my email perfectly. I highly recommend the app. | Just tried to book tickets for my family. When entering dates of birth the app actually changes them. For example when I enter 22 into the ‚Äúday‚Äù field it changes it to 21 right after I go to another field.
Reading in the app reviews and on Google, maybe this is an issue with USA bookings. | Could not get the app to book my tickets | Email received shows the wrong travel dates, booking app shows correct dates.  Tried the chat feature on your app and the algorithm of it doesn‚Äôt help in these circumstances. | First, I‚Äôve traveled by train for work and pleasure and have had to use this app to book or manage my travel. Its constantly not working, freezing, payment page won‚Äôt load, several error messages, etc. this is not worth the struggle or hassle and will totally turn you off for trains | No way to reach customer service.! They canceled my train and I can‚Äôt rebook and get a refund! | Show the booking in some foreign language | The app does almost everything‚Ä¶ except let me login to my account. App quits back to the Home Screen. I‚Äôm sure they will fix it in the next update. Looking forward to my first trip next summer!

Login bug fixed! Changed to 5 stars. See. I knew they would fix it. | I wanted to pay homage to the hard working people of the Eurostar family and enjoy traveling at the same time.

Tried booking my flight there and it kept throwing an error when the prices were low. Tried again the next day and the same error. Now the prices are double and customer service is not answering. Terrible app and company. | check in process does not offer possibility to chosd seat, in spite of expectation to be able too
very disappointing and not conform to promise | Every time I attempt to login through the app, I‚Äôm given an error message saying an unexpected error has occurred and to contact support. I can login on the website fine, so I know it‚Äôs not my username or password. | Download twice today launch it and it hangs on the opening graphic
No amount of touching will make it go beyond this screen 
Wife on Android works fine
So much for the hyped Apple ecosystem | Super cumbersome platform  to use - it is hard to find where to type a confirmation number 
The upcoming flights are not showing automatically | It switches you from business class to economy class so be careful | Will not work on my phone, just crashes | They don‚Äôt support Apple Wallet, and you must use this app to get your pass instead, except that when scanning the QR code of my ticket I‚Äôm just taken to the app but nothing happens. It‚Äôd be simpler if they just used Apple Wallet, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel (and the wheel doesn‚Äôt even work). | Whoa this app is bad. Learn from other airline apps like Delta and do better. | app has a lot of errors when going backwards to previous pages or also when checking in | The app is useless as I keep getting refresh message instead of my dashboard | I have been trying to add the flexing blue card to the Apple wallet but it doesn‚Äôt work. Either from the website or from the mobile app. I hope you will fix this soon | Prices are different when looking on computer browser vs. phone vs. tablet.  Also, app *conveniently* throws an error when trying to book the cheapest ticket.  It is deceptive and most likely illegal to show differing prices across different platforms.  Classic bait and switch as others have mentioned.  I have screenshots to prove this. | While visually pleasing, practically it‚Äôs difficult up for basic things like seat assignments and checkin. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to select separate seats when traveling with someone forcing you to sit side by side. 

Why are seat maps pulled several days before departure where no assignment is possible? Where do they go? It‚Äôs inconsistent and often unable to do seats on partner Delta in the same record. | Outstanding service to ALL | I‚Äôve gotten the ‚ÄúSorry, something went wrong‚Ä¶please try again‚Äù error more times than I can count.  I‚Äôm trying to plan a trip and rarely get all the way to the final price screen.  There are no software updates and I‚Äôve removed/reinstalled the app, powered/repowered my phone but nothing helps.  I can book the tickets online but will need the app on travel day and fear it won‚Äôt work. | I've gotten the worst treatment and run around from any single air line company in my life. My flight was cancelled workout notification. So confusing | I reloaded the app a million times and it‚Äôs still vertical.  Screen lock is NOT on.  I give up. It‚Äôs super annoying | I use my Airfrance app a lot to book flights to France, but now I‚Äôm having g a problem with Airfrance app! The app keeps crashing for 2 months now, I cannot use it for anything. What is the problem with the app?!!? Can someone please fix this issue? | I downloaded the Air France app in the Stuttgart, Germany to check in and manage my return flights to the United States the the prior to my departure. At first, everything worked well. Then, on the day of travel, the app ceased functioning at, of all places, 
Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in the Air France Lounge. Its symptoms were simply the app would begin to open then stopped and closed. Repeated attempts to use it resulted in the same failures. I tried deleting it from my iPhone and reloading it, but it still failed to open. Fortunately I had a hard copy of my boarding passes and had saved soft copies on my iPhone. I have no suggestions for the app‚Äôs failure as it worked on my iPhone the day before my flight, only to crash and burn the day I actually needed its services. | There is a lot to desire. First when asked for either loyalty number or email, the app doesn‚Äôt allow for the loyalty number. Then you are asked for captcha for every transaction. And then authentication method is so warped that I have given up.  If I had a known this before, I might have chosen a different airline as the airline apps are more and more important. | The app works well and customer support is great if you have an issue. | Their website booked me the ticket without asking for my confirmation or payment. Took me an hour to cancel. | Great job! | After picking flight with price and inputting name and other information, the next screen tells you ‚Äúsince you selected the flight the price has increased by ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù. This is something close to bait and switch scams but after booking 3 flights with the same price increase after selecting the flight it is clear Air France and KLM are just scamming customers with misleading prices on flights. These airline companies would be better not doing business at all. If we didn‚Äôt need to use them there is no way we would chose these two disreputable companies. | Cancelled flights, no communication, dysfunctional customer service, relationship with Delta totally broken. 
Dreadful. | ËÆæÁΩÆÂêàÁêÜÔºåÊìç‰ΩúÊñπ‰æøÔºåÂæàË¥¥ÂøÉ„ÄÇ | Trying to log in to get my mobile boarding pass for my flight and not only did the app take forever to download on WiFi (I‚Äôll chalk it up to slow WiFi) but every time I try to open the app it crashes. Every. Single. Time. I just want my boarding pass for my flight, and even the Air France is unresponsive. My mom was able to get her boarding pass after a while but my app still crashes. Both of us are using the latest app version on an iPhone 15/15 Pro. Just let Delta handle our check in and boarding passes instead of sending us through Air France and their crummy app | I had to change my password and had to open a new account since I was not working for the same company. All of my miles were lost from the other account , I was a silver member in my old account and now I am just a beginner, funny though my account number never changed???When I called flying blue to try to get my miles linked to my new account they literally said I had to find all of the old flights!!!! I am talking about at least more than 10 years of flying with Air France‚Ä¶ my compliments‚Ä¶ nice way to treat a long time member. | Help | Useless | The Air France app is the best! | I‚Äôve never worked with a travel app that didn‚Äôt have an option to just bring up your boarding pass in a quick  and reasonable way. Why download this app?!?!? | I couldn‚Äôt enter my travel partner‚Äôs date of birth because the application kept reverting to the same date however many ways I tried to make it work | Le site ne permet pas de s√©lectionner le si√®ge‚Ä¶ un message dit que la s√©lection est possible apr√®s le check in‚Ä¶ Ce qui est malheureusement impossible‚Ä¶ m√™me en voulant payer‚Ä¶
De plus Impossible d‚Äôentrer mon num√©ro Flying Blue‚Ä¶
C‚Äôest surprenant que ces demandes basiques ne puissent pas √™tre satisfaites sur l‚Äôapplication‚Ä¶ | I was on a premium flight, you cancelled me from the flight but kept my other family members on the flight.

I had planned to switch to a cheaper option, but forgot! I email the company and Kerry replied. He was very kind, understood my situation, and helped guide me through cancelling my payment. I plan to keep a less costly subscription for this app, just because the Creator was so kind!
As for the usability of the app, I found it very helpful with planning hikes and for navigation. I can tell the Creator put a lot of thought into creating this app. 5 stars!!! | The free NPS app has very similar content on a much easier to use platform‚Ä¶ and did I mention free? 

The adds for this app were deceiving to make it seem like these guides were free, or at least affordable. But $19.99 per month to access park travel guides, which is what is advertised, is very overpriced. Based on other subscribers‚Äô reviews of the paid content, I‚Äôll pass. Without the $19.99/month subscription, the app offers little to no functionality and is not worth the used space on your phone! Do yourselves a favor and download the NPS app. 

I‚Äôll also add that the developers‚Äô response to some of these reviews and the active deception and hiding of their fees makes me question the morality of the developer‚Ä¶ yet another reason why I‚Äôm not willing to risk $19.99 to give the paid version a shot. I hope you will also think twice before paying the developer! | Paid for the subscription. Verified that I‚Äôm subscribed but it freezes every time that I try to download the map for offline usage and then prompts me to ‚Äústart 3 day trial‚Äù and then just repeats that I‚Äôm already subscribed. Shame. | I got excited after reading Nikon‚Äôs photography challenge. However, when I downloaded the app, they wanted $19.99/month! I do not go to enough parks for that kind of money. It was a little less for 3 months, but still an expensive regular fee. I‚Äôm not asking for anything for free, but this was too much for my budget. Best of luck to them. It looks like it would be a cool way to track park experiences. | The free NPS app has the same content, including links to nearby parks/monuments/trails without adding extra unnecessary information. You can also save the NPS parks for offline use. I mean, if you‚Äôd like to waste at least $19.99 per month, this is an option, I guess. EDIT: The developer responded, saying I‚Äôm putting out misinformation‚Ä¶that the PARK TRAVEL GUIDE app only costs money if you want to access PARK TRAVEL GUIDES. So, thank you Chimani for verifying what I wrote. You DO charge a minimum of $19.99/mo to use the primary functions of your app. LOL EDIT 2: Chimani removed their comment about ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù and changed their claims YET AGAIN. I don‚Äôt trust a developer who keeps moving the goalposts and using doublespeak to hide their fees. | Very useful,with interesting content | The ‚Äúupdated‚Äù version completely changed all the features that made this a fantastic app and now it‚Äôs almost useless.  The previous map was great: you could sort by type of national park property (or just view them all) and easily see visited vs. unvisited sites. Yes, I‚Äôve had communications as to how I‚Äôm supposed to still be able to do something similar, but let‚Äôs be honest, it doesn‚Äôt come even close to the functionality of the previous version. Oh so sad. I seldom use the app anymore. | Was using this app for nearly 4 years and visited majority of the US while traveling for work. Perfect features for visiting monuments, preserves to National Parks. Absolutely loved this app. 

Once the new upgrade happened, it‚Äôs simple features became a hinderance. Factoring in the pay feature, they had a great system going till they messed it up. 

Hard to imagine messing up a mayonnaise sandwich but I guess anything is possible. | The information provided by this app is generic and not very helpful for selecting somewhere to visit and figuring out what to do there. I think you are better off visiting nps.gov and the many excellent travel blogs for actual useful information. There are more specialized apps that are much more useful for hiking. There is something cheap and tawdry about the app‚Äôs gamification of visiting national parks, as well as the ads appearing on most screens.

UPDATE: I did look at the guides and they are hard to use. Typically, you have a map with many points but few labels, so it‚Äôs hard to know or remember what you are looking at. You can also see lists of hikes, waterfalls, et cetera, but there‚Äôs no way to put together a coherent picture or plan. Information can be out of date, e.g., the Grove of the Patriarchs at Mt. Ranier is closed with no re-opening date. | If I want to record a past visit you can‚Äôt record multiple days at once with drag and drop‚Ä¶would be much easier if you could. | Why did you screw up the map?  I liked to be able to easily see which parks I had been to in an area.  Bring that back!!! | Just like ALL the recent reviews I‚Äôm so upset they ruined one of the Best apps for national Parks.  This app helped us visit 46 national Parks and now it‚Äôs trash. It completely wiped all the tracking we had in place. The map to find parks near you is gone and now they show way to much on the maps so you can‚Äôt actually find the 63 NPs.  

I can‚Äôt understand why they would take something so good and put out this crap.  Look at your user reviews since the update they are all 1 star. 

Bring back the original app!!! | This was the absolute best app for tracking National Parks / Monuments etc. Then the changed the mapping data and its a giant steaming pile of hot garbage now. Sad, I really loved this app. | I am not happy at all with the new version, I will never use guides , you took away the map of the US showing each park and the ones I have already visited a different color. You would simply click on the park and would get a description and another click would take you directly to the National Park page, I wished you would change this app back , I cannot see using this app anymore | Every time I click on Utah it goes to West Virginia. I kinda have an idea of what‚Äôs in the state, but I would also like to see what‚Äôs there and see the info of what‚Äôs in the state for any park weather it state  or National. | For years this has been my go-to national park app. I even bought the lifetime subscription. Ever since the last update to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù their app it‚Äôs straight garbage. Please roll back to the old version until you find developers that can actually build a good UI. The current version isn‚Äôt even a beta version. Please fix this or honestly I‚Äôd like a refund on my subscription. Back to the NPS app for me. | I signed up for the app to get the discounts but there is no information on the app about how to use them. I think the discounts are on the web interface but sometimes they say to use a ‚Äúpromo code‚Äù to get them and then other times mention a ‚ÄúChimani perks card‚Äù which I never received. Anyone know this? | I have been using this app since it was started and now ‚Ä¶ ugh. What happened to the maps? I used to be able to hike in a park, open the map and see where I was. I have told so many lost hikers about this app, but now I can‚Äôt even find the map. What happened?? | Really dissatisfied with the recent update. Previously it was great to be able to see what Parks you‚Äôd visited by type on one of the many map layers that you could select from. | This app makes it impossible to unsubscribe. | No idea how to reach you; tried app support with no luck.   I have been an extremely heavy user of chimani for several years‚Ä¶and loved it.   Now, I neeed to go through multiple steps to load the map‚Ä¶and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to display all the park sites without you grouping them‚Ä¶again, anotherstep I have to go through.  Please, can I have my old simple app back? | Why would you take what was a good app, and turn it into this?!?!  The new map is horrible and the app is much worse now in general | My favorite part of the original app was the way I could sort categories on a map.  I could see what is in the area while I was traveling.  It would also change the graphic colors on parks I have visited on the maps.  This version requires me to know the name of a park before I look up the information.  I hate this new version.  I have been to 50 national Parks & they only appear on a list.  Even worse the update no longer recognizes I paid for the guides. | Every time I switch to my Google Notes app to look up the date I visited a park, this app forces me to log back in and go through the process of finding the park that I was updating. So frustrating! | I‚Äôve been using this app since it started and love it! I track all of my trips and have recorded my past trips, and the guides are helpful. | And the stamp locations? | I tried to find out terms of use for renewals, etc, but the app makes this simple function impossible. Still trying to find this basic user info page after 20 mins. I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúauto-renew‚Äù as I only plan to use this app for a certain trip in 2021. So... this app lost cred with me right away. | I‚Äôve had Chimani for years and bought a lifetime membership in 2018. Their customer service is outstanding!  Kerry has helped me with a complicated subscription issue and worked everything out for me. I now have one account with all my info. Can‚Äôt wait to use it on our big upcoming trip! | I recently started using the Chimani National Park app and I love it! Very helpful information and a great tool for planning trips to parks we want to visit. Wish I had known about this app years ago. Can‚Äôt wait for more state parks to be added. | I paid 29.99 and didn‚Äôt get anything???? What a waste of money, I want Apple to refund my $$ for this app purchase!! | It‚Äôs a sad  you are forcing people to a subscription model. I Bought the Smoky mountain app and now it will not be supported anymore. | Trails are only visible when zoomed in so far one cannot get the big picture. 
Also it would be nice to be able to highlight individual trails since otherwise it is hard to see which trail is which when there are many intersections | Why doesn‚Äôt the app show the gateway arch or Indiana Dunes as national parks yet? | I use tons of apps, but rarely do reviews, but, with such exemplary support, I have to do this review. 
There was a small problem with my account, caused by me, and they happily rectified it lightning quick. 
I love supporting worthy developers. Thanks! | It might be a good app if you spend the $30 a year subscription, but the free app is worthless.

I wish that in the description the App developer was clear about the subscription costs.  Many apps have a free version that has some things, but this free version is useless

The information you get is absolutely not worth the price of this subscription. All of it you could easily get online or from the literature at the entrance gate of national parks. | Wouldn't store park info before. Now they charge a ridiculous fee for info that can be had for free from other sources. I have deleted this app. | There is absolutely no redeeming feature of this app. The parks themselves provide better and more insight than this ripoff. They stole $30 from me, DO NOT let this happen to you! A complete waste of storage space. | Not free at all.  Will not let you try it out unless you have either sufficient funds on apple store for full year or credit card  on file with apple | I‚Äôve been using this app for many years and find it incredibly useful!  There are a few little things that have been identified in other reviews, so I‚Äôm not going to repeat them.  This app is well worth having and using if you frequent the National Parks - especially if you hike into the parks, beyond the parking lots and congestion.  I spend a lot of time on remote trails, and some not so remote.  There have been several times this app helped me find my way back after a long day on a confusing trail system. I always carry a paper map (as a backup), but there‚Äôs nothing like being able to view your location on a downloaded map of the trail system!  Btw, I even carry a small solar panel to charge my phone.
As with most apps, you MUST use it and familiarize yourself with it to fully benefit from its many features. | This app is great for planning national park trips! I‚Äôve used it on my last five and it always gives great tips and ideas. Download it! | I would pay a small fee but I don‚Äôt want the hassle of. Setting up a subscription and canceling etc. just make it an in app purchase and be done with it | best app for traveling to canyons. | The app work fine on my android phone, but I am unable to download Park guides on the iPad app. | This used to be a free 5 star app. Then they changed their model to a rather expensive pay-for basis. In the meantime I have loaded years of info covering some 37 National Parks and I am now locked out of that data because they now insist I pay a fee to look at MY DATA!

I‚Äôm pretty angry. Not because they need to charge money for what is a pretty good app but they didn't give me chance to get my data or give me free access to the parks I‚Äôd already been to (and provided them info on). My data made this app better but I‚Äôm locked out of it. So when did I go to the Talus Cave at Pinnacles NP, or hike Wheeler Peak at Great Basin? | This app is not user friendly. I paid for the year and I can‚Äôt figure out the trip planning. I downloaded the minimal map and the other one that was supposed to be more detailed, they were the same. This app is a waste of money. | Why on earth would I pay a subscription for what is essentially a database of National Park brochures. I can download these for free on the internet. | Because I had used the free version of the app to plan our park visits, it was easy to decide to pay for the lifetime membership.  The features I like most are the descriptions with photos and maps for hiking.  The app also allows you to easily keep track of parks you have visited - nice if all of the National Parks are on a bucket list.  Customer support is very responsive. | The app was a tremendous assistance while we toured Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.  Real time downloaded info and location identification made our park visits more enjoyable and less work than would have been possible with hard copy maps.  Great purchase.  Bought the lifetime membership to help with future park visits. | We have used the Chimani App over the past couple of years at various National Parks with great results. We purchase a lifetime subscription and are definitely getting out monies worth. | It‚Äôs not my repertoire to give thanks and praise for good service that I expect and deserve. But in the case of Chimani I will make an exception; their service and communication is without fault, almost instantaneous; the information provided in accurate and up to date, the app the most useful of all, nothing comes even close. The yearly membership was given too me as a gift, a gift that keeps giving and giving.

Waste of time and efforts and money for workers. | I have several friends who use this app, and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but it will not let me create a profile or create an account. I don‚Äôt know if this is a glitch in the app or if there‚Äôs a completely different way to sign up that is just not known. | I‚Äôve been looking for opportunities farther than a month out and everything‚Äôs full. Hosts who have profiles saying they have availability all text back saying they‚Äôre full. The ID verification system wouldn‚Äôt accept my passport nor my license. It is frustrating and feels futile. I wish I hadn‚Äôt paid the $60 for us to use this app. It‚Äôs a nice idea though. | The fact that hosts register for free and backpackers have to ‚Äúpay‚Äù to sign up for this platform to work for hosts for free is already a goddamn unfairness. Useless platform, full of entitled and racist hosts. Honestly, I shouldn‚Äôt have even signed up, one of my biggest regrets. Such a waste of money. | I have found amazing volunteer opportunities with free accommodation, which have been great learning experiences. Very grateful for Workaway and would recommend it to any budget traveler or a person looking to gain more hands-on experience in a field they‚Äôre interested in! | Great App but instead of connecting you to the website when clicking on menus, build it into the app so it doesnt always refer you to another webpage to the certain menu. | I love using Workaway to find places to travel, but the app is really bad. It‚Äôs super frustrating to use. It has a ton of glitches, bad filters for looking for places and overall hard to use. | Unfortunately this app could be a great travel-networking app, but it ends up being just an exploitative experience. 
Working five hours a day, five days a week, often leaves the traveler without much time to do anything that is fun. The exception is when you get a host particularly good at taking their workawayers for local hikes, events and to nearby attractions as part of the schedule. But most f the time its just a person or business who wants to get free labor and push you along out the door as soon as they aren't. 

You have to really get a good host invested in making it a balanced experience, which in seven months of being a member and actively using the app, I've found 1 out of every 7 hosts actually are going to make it a good experience. 

So be careful, rate often, and choose wisely. | Work away blocked my account because they said I sent to many messages that was spam , Work Away  is a rip off and will not be good ‚Ä¶ until their app Works | The app needs a lot of work | Won‚Äôt let me log in. I log in just fine on my browser. Useless | Easy to use and a great way to make connections !   ‚ù§Ô∏è | It keep asking me to log in when I haven‚Äôt even made a account. It won‚Äôt show a make a account option either | I‚Äôm a verified member. I use the website with no problems all the time. But every time I try to login on the App, I fail to login. This has been going for months now. 

FIX IT for God‚Äôs sake. | Great ! | Very easy to use! | They have fake offers and inactive hosts to catch people to pay their membresy. They ask a very expensive fee to apply, I paid for it because they had 4 great opportunities. Just one of the hosts responded to say they were not hiring people because of covid. I asked my money back and they say it‚Äôs not possible. | How can I create a profile ? , is only asking me to log in into a already existing account | Having a great time using the WorkAway app- very easy to use, simplifies a lot of things. Love the ‚Äúmap‚Äù feature while searching for my next destination | Hoooyeah!! | Thank u so much for giving us this amazing app !! | Filter button not working, please fix. | App is easy and a lot of choices! Only downside is sometimes the app will glitch and wont let me click on certain tabs. | A traves de workaway podes alojarte en muchas partes del mundo mediante intercambio de trabajo, lo que es una excelente idea y maravillosa herramienta. 

Igualmente, creo que podrian exigir mas especificidad sobre el tipo y las horas de trabajo que pide cada anfitrion, asi como lo que ofrece respecto de comida, alojamiento y tiempo libre. Muchos anfitriones se vuelven muy exigentes y se olvidan de que estan alojando unx voluntarix, no unx empleadx con goce de sueldo.

Tambien con respecto a algo mas urgente, cuando se le envia un mensaje a unx anfitrionx, desde el mismo mensaje deberia ser posible redirigirse a la solicitud, asi podemos recordar con quien estamos hablando. Cuando alguien que viaja se quiere poner en contacto don dos o tres personas que son anfitrionas en el lugar de destino, se olvida de quien representa qu√© lugar, y se genera mucha confusion.  

Gracias. | It‚Äôs a perfect way to connect with people so far!!! | I‚Äôve both hosted and been hosted through Workaway and have had lots of great experiences through it all.  Thank you | It‚Äôs an awesome application that connects people with the same interest ! 
I just love it and loved everyone I met through it! | Workaway is the best program in the world! Easy to use and I love the profiles | TrustedHouseSitters is so much better.  Was hoping to switch gears for a stay in CA and volunteer.  Slim pickings.  The app is not good.  A huge waste of money. | Every is like the website which is one of the best ‚ÄúWorkaway‚Äù websites I've seen, but needs to be able to go landscape/portrait mode | I definitely met best people here but customers service. I‚Äôm transgender guy  and I prefer to make more ladies friend as my travel buddy, so mostly I talk with ladies and I got warning saying that..avoid taking with only female member this is not dating site, when I explained about my situation they terminated.. | I have this app downloaded on my iPhone as well as my iPad Pro. My only critical feedback is that the App does not rotate from Portrait to Landscape with the rotation of the device. I am a vision impaired person and the ability to better see, type on my iPad is compromised by the lack of this particular feature. 
Is this capability something that can be added? I would rate this at 5 stars if it was.
Thanks! | Needs improvement. Trying to select hosts, links not working. Should be able to find someone in your area as a traveling buddy. Otherwise what‚Äôs the point? | I was so excited to find the app, but it gives me a blank screen 60% of the time when I click on a host. Guess I‚Äôll stick to my PC. | Yup | I faced few times errors when I wanted to log in to my account while using the App. | From what I can tell, there‚Äôs no way to search without choosing a location. A significant bummer because I find my next destination by discovering great opportunities that match my interests. I‚Äôve found myself in some pretty unexpected places this way, and been the better for it. I wish you could do a worldwide search based on skills, language, setting, etc. As it is, this app is pretty useless for me. | WorkAway has become my key to traveling the world at a fraction of the cost that it would for most people. The site has been great to use, but the app is even cleaner and makes searching for hosts and navigating all the functions even smoother.

You can‚Äôt reach anybody on Groupon only through a text it took me an hour back-and-forth to get the right confirmation code and then we made reservations for Statue of Liberty and only a couple reservations went through. It has been nothing but a headache. I suggest go straight through Go City, and I actually talk to a human that will help you guide you all this hassle. Just save a couple dollars is not worth it. | The older version can add attraction to a specific date with Morning, Afternoon and evening option. Now, all selected events are unscheduled and cannot do anything else. Need to fix this! | one day only 2 attractions, almost same price for two regular price, but on your own pace and condition, | They have a ‚Äúsavings guarantee‚Äù but it‚Äôs only if you book 3x a day which is virtually impossible. I used it for 3 days to get premium offers. One of them cancelled on me due to weather. I did the math and I would have saved money if I would have booked everything individually 2 events a day. | Lousy info and customer service | Information on their website is outdated and the customer service is lousy | Don‚Äôt even think about using this service. They are overpricing. I bought the tickets for Rome for 3 activities worth $100 and the total entry fee for the very same tickets if bought individually were less than $50. They claim they give you up to 35% which is a flat out lie. | ‚ÄúIf it is too good to be true, it probably is‚Äù. At first look you would feel they provide better value for money. However, most attractions will treat you like a freeloader. I took a two say pass for miami. And the pass stated ‚Äújust show up and show the pass‚Äù. But Most of the good attractions mentioned they only allow limited people from gocity pass. That means each day, if you go early, you can get one to one good attraction and by the time you finish it all the other ones are sold out. Their customer service is horrible and do not honor the misleading claims stated in the pass. They offered us a partial refund provided we go to multiple attractions and prove that none of them is accepting go city pass. That makes no sense given our valuable time of lost in the process. That said, it is still worth it if you plan to go to multiple attractions. I got a 50% discount on the pass. So covering 4 attractions from the list of 40+ attractions (some are far away from miami and some are not worth your time) will make up for the cost. So plan to book and pay directly for the main attractions like speedboat and if you did end up taking a pass, use it for the less popular attractions. Always call ahead and try to book it as much as possible. | Don‚Äôt buy the pass the day you arrive thinking you can use it. It apparently has to go through security checks which takes about 6 hours so now we are here waiting with nothing to do since this was our plan today. I called and they ‚Äúflagged our order‚Äù to be processed sooner but still will take hours. Absolutely ridiculous!!! They don‚Äôt advertise this and I‚Äôve been to many other cities using go passes and never had to wait to receive it! | Made accessing attractions quick and easy | The app is glitchy. On initial load- the app looks like it‚Äôs struggling to refresh and it‚Äôs stuck on a loop doing so. | Everything tells you to make a reservation right? You can only do it same day. Customer service is non existent, I‚Äôve seen 5 year olds with better manners and customer service skills.
Was told no problem as soon as we get confirmation you didn‚Äôt go we will redo the tickets. No call, no email. I called back to be told they can not help me. HORRIBLE DO NOT USE! | When you open the map it opens the wrong address. Made us miss a cruise. | We just got 4 go city passes for 3 things to do and in an hour and a half they now say expired and we haven‚Äôt even used them once | Title says it all, planned a vacation around a cruise but they had no indication that it was close for the entire weekend we went. Probably won‚Äôt use it again. | I saw the promises this app made and was skeptical; it just sounded too good to be true. This app is 100% worth getting. We were able to save $50 with this (we did the 2 day all inclusive). Absolutely get this app if you can | I and my family used the All Inclusive pass and had a blast in Boston!!! We went through sooooooooo many places and there was no hassle of waiting in line or worry about ticket.
The best thing about this was after the whole trip, I calculated the saving of about $1200.
Yeah, next trip to Hawaii!!!!!!!üòÜüòÜ | Lowered the review because it asks to rate all the time | I have had nothing but problems using this app! | Tried to purchase from their website, won‚Äôt accept payment.  Called the help line, they said use the ap they apparently no longer accept web payments.   Used the ap, get ‚Äúunknown failure‚Äù message with 2 different credit cards.   Guess my money is not worthy of their product. | Could have bought tickets cheaper on my own! | Can‚Äôt sync my passes to my email or app. | This pass is useless in Amsterdam. The pass doesn't book tickets so you have to make reservation online with the sites, but you can't pay for the reservations with the pass. Either you chance it and hope that when you arrive you can get in with your pass, or you pay separately and the pass is worthless. DO NOT go without reservations because you will not get in. The sites cost less than the pass in total. And the ferry to the castle was closed entirely so we got stuck 10 miles from the castle without a way back. The Uber cost $70 round trip. Absolutely a waste of money. | A huge portion of the activities were unavailable in general but you don‚Äôt find this out till after you purchase and try to make reservations.   Then overnight 1/4 of the remaining options disappeared.  Our premium activity was cancelled by the vendor 10 minutes prior to our reservation and they won‚Äôt reschedule or refund, of course on GoCity it shows up as utilized. | Bought this pass as it said I could choose from the San Diego Zoo or Adventure Park (not both). Fine with me as we were only planning to go to the zoo. Once paid for, neither was an option. What a rip off! | The app is easy to use and pretty simple | This has the option to add activities to an itinerary, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to view that itinerary after adding activities to it. I eventually figured out that if I add activities to my ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù instead, I was able to see a list of favorites.

The favorites button is a white button which is displayed on top of an image of the activity. Unfortunately one of the activities I wanted to add to my favorites had an image that was white too in the area where the favorite button was (white on white) so I had no idea whether I was successfully tapping the favorites button. I eventually figured out that I could tap where I thought the favorites button probably was and then go to my favorites list and check if the activity was listed in my favorites‚Ä¶nope, not there. So I tried again‚Ä¶That time it worked.

So after some trial and error I got this to work acceptably to be able to see a list of the activities I plan to do and tap on them to get directions to them. It would be helpful to have these things improved though. | We had a two day pass. We saved $147 each above what we paid for the pass. We used the app and just presented our passes on my phone and in we went. No problems. Probably got to do and see more because we didn‚Äôt worry about needing to spend all day at the aquarium to ‚Äúget our money‚Äôs worth‚Äù, for example. | Best bang for your buck when it comes to bundling deals AND saves you money in the end. The Inclusive pass is where it‚Äôs at. | These passes are great. Saves time having to order at every individual attraction & money‚Ä¶ one set price for all depending on the number of attractions. The difference between all inclusive & explorer is‚Ä¶ inclusive pass gives you 35 attractions for a set amount of days while explorer pass allows you to experience the number of attractions over several days/weeks. I chose explorer. üòç | Es mejor comprar por separado tus sitios de inter√©s, no es m√°s econ√≥mico comprarlo con esta aplicaci√≥n. Compre 10 atracciones y solo pude disfrutar de 6. Luego no hay forma de tener atenci√≥n al cliente, no hay quien resuelva tus inconvenientes. | Firstly I like the idea of this app. Rather than scrambling through bunch of different websites to get tickets. You just use this app.

Secondly, I was skeptical about it at first. We went to the edge in Hudson yards. I thought I would have to go back to the ticket counter & get tickets. But it went smoothly. As soon as we went in, the staff was happy to see the QR code and let us in without any questions. I have only used it once. I am actually looking forward to reuse this app. | I bought go-city passes for Barcelona, Paris, and Rome.  In Rome, NONE of the places listed as included (except Big Bus) took our tickets.  In Paris, we got the Museum Pass in addition to Big Buss, but nothing else worked.  We never got the chance to try them in Barcelona, but if you are thinking of traveling outside the US, AVOID THIS COMPANY! | Since you buy passes first, then reserve, you cannot get a pass for what you want to do because everything is already booked. | Processed three different orders and each was cancelled, effectively maxing out my card (at least for 1-2 billing cycles) without a deliverable. WTH. | Seems to difficult to figure it out! | Be aware that this pass is not all inclusive as they say. If you see tours from the same company in this pass, even though it says all inclusive they only let you do one of the tours, not multiple. | It‚Äôs a bit confusing on how to add the passes. | The effort to connect the pass to the reservations is unnecessarily complicated and not user friendly. It asks for the code for the passes when you follow the links to make the reservation. It doesn‚Äôt tell you you will need the code nor does it automatically provide the code. It should be pretty simple to make this on a secure link. | Very convenient | A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE! Trying to sync tickets purchased at Tickets At Work is taking over a hour. I purchased 2 different kinds of tickets and Go City doesn‚Äôt recognize all of the tickets. The rep otp was very pleasant and a little hard to understand. Horrible experience. | Frequency of Hop on Bus can be better | When I bought the pass it was supposed to include a lot of things. When I got to Paris none of the things that were supposed to be included were part of my pass. Almost everything said I had to pay more. I would not buy a pass again from this company since they changed what was included right as I got to the city and started going places. | We purchased the family a 3-day pass in Stockholm after having an extremely positive experience with the Copenhagen Card. Unfortunately this pass and the app are NOT as user-friendly as that one. We couldn‚Äôt get on any of the boat tours we wanted because you can‚Äôt sign up in advance without being at their kiosk which doesn‚Äôt help on a short trip. The hop on/off buses were very confusing as there are two different companies that run practically identical looking buses but this one only ran 3 to cover their whole city route on a busy holiday weekend. When asked about it, the customer service was very defensive (to the point of being borderline rude) with little to offer as a solution. They also dropped a few of the attractions between the time I initially looked at it and booked the passes. Given our experience I would have rather booked tickets directly with Stromma and paid for the various museums than deal with the hassle that has been navigating the pass/app. | The lines to use this pass are extremely long.   Hour + long wait‚Ä¶don‚Äôt purchase. | Great app & it‚Äôs super easy to use. Plenty of choices to pick from to see various sites within a city. Highly recommend. | I purchased 3 adult and 1 child pass, and the child pass did not appear in my passes - and it is very difficult to find out how to contact anyone to fix this. | You still have to make your way to an office for a Paper ticket to ride the bus. What‚Äôs the point of the app??? | Used the 2-Day unlimited pass for Barcelona. I did end up saving some money with this, but only because I felt compelled to go to more destinations that were covered by the pass than I would have otherwise if I hadn‚Äôt ponied up. Tours booked up fast and for the Picasso museum in particular you are not allowed to visit if you don‚Äôt go with the tour, which was disappointing as we then had to pay for that out of pocket. Not a disaster, but I can‚Äôt recommend this pass. | The GoCity pass has no disclaimer or forewarning on being able to reserve a 10pin Chicago Bowling after 6pm. We were denied access because it was 8pm. Also you cannot reserve times for the 360 Chicago either, had to go their website to find out the hard way.
Other than that, GoCity Pass was amazing and worked on all the attractions, but just failed to leave some important details for first time consumers such as myself.";4.69718;16290;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/25/62/39/25623964-62b5-2562-e6a5-ec5f730b4dd7/bf05794e-8568-404e-a187-8e3719354968_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/33/aa/57/33aa57cb-8505-193b-5721-8306803c013d/662805ea-6c0a-463c-8574-fd40c78d259c_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/47/09/5c/47095c75-3228-93c9-19fd-31acd6890bdc/3eb58c33-f653-4145-bf2d-1b333832b61a_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/c8/d1/a5/c8d1a572-f32e-b7dc-6fb3-8d2b0fb95d2c/a263ef16-6bca-4834-b71a-92cfe6412625_4.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/a5/56/6e/a5566ef4-f2a5-e580-c163-25d6d522afb0/21747f9a-6e66-49e7-85f4-4080dd0b4799_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2024-03-13_at_09.58.27.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/24/b6/07/24b6073d-2113-c8a9-4b93-8904026c9ce4/2146b8c6-d526-4dad-b144-c393c98fb715_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2024-03-13_at_09.59.29.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/d6/c5/e1/d6c5e1d6-8963-fbc6-56f0-79c0a8178a72/c2bef4e6-bd81-486a-a0da-4ba71f91b600_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2024-03-13_at_09.58.46.png/576x768bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"
1520656722;"gov.dhs.cbp.pspd.mpc";"Mobile Passport Control";"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobile-passport-control/id1520656722?uo=4";"Mobile Passport Control (MPC) is an official application created by U.S. Customs and Border Protection that streamlines your CBP processing experience at select U.S. entry locations. Simply fill out your traveler profile, answer CBP inspection-related questions, and proceed straight to the ‚ÄúMobile Passport Control‚Äù lane at the airport or seaport. 

MPC is a voluntary program which can be used by U.S. Citizens, Canadian Citizen Visitors, Lawful Permanent Residents, and Visa Waiver Program Visitors at any of the supported airport and seaport locations found on our website: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/mobile-passport-control 

MPC provides a more efficient, secure in-person inspection process for the CBP Officer and the traveler, and shortens overall entry wait times. 


MPC can be used in 6 simple steps:

1. Create a traveler profile using biographic information from your passport; You can create a profile for all eligible members in a family group. Your profiles will be securely stored on your device completely free to be used for future travel.

2. Select your method of travel, select your port of entry and terminal (if applicable), answer CBP inspection-related questions, certify the truthfulness and accuracy of your answers, and, upon arriving at your selected port of entry, tap the ‚ÄúSubmit Now‚Äù button.

3. Capture a clear and unobstructed photo of each traveler (including yourself) that you added to your submission.

4. Once your submission is processed, CBP will send a virtual receipt back to your device.

5. Proceed to the MPC designated lane upon arrival and be prepared to present your passport and other relevant travel documents. Please note: MPC does not replace your passport; your passport will need to be presented to the CBP Officer.

6. The CBP Officer will complete the inspection. If further information is required, the CBP Officer will let you know.";"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/a9/95/89/a9958932-7ebc-c1bf-9858-f2a7bc804761/AppIcon-0-1x_U007ephone-0-0-0-0-sRGB-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg";"[""Travel""]";"[""6003""]";"Travel";6003;"4+";"[""EN"",""FR"",""ES""]";"49446912";"15.0";"2021-05-11T07:00:00Z";"2024-02-27T17:04:45Z";"Additions

The regular Passport line was 20 min faster!!! | I had a separate line to go through because I had used this app. Much faster than the other lines at the Seattle airport. | Amazing tools to provide fast access and easy thanks | I think they nailed it.  Simple and user friendly process.   Enough said. | All ready to ‚Äúspeed through‚Äù customs. We were told as soon as hit the concourse that it isn‚Äôt used here anymore. | No CBP/MPC lane in LAX terminal 7 although the app has one listed. Disappointed. | Works great | Very good makes life easier | Easy process to sign up. | Terminal 8 AA is horrible. If you are flying in MPC is not accepted | Absolutely awesome app. Kudos to CBP | Aside from having difficulty due to server issue, after several attempts, submission was successful | This app is simple, intuitive and a big time saver. | We tried this app on Monday when we arrived to Miami. It was the slowest line of all, the green card holders and tourists‚Äô lines were a lot faster. And they ask the same questions again. I will not use it again. There was a lady in front of me and she was saying the same, it was worse. Very bad experience. There was just 1 person for all of the ones that used the MPC app. | Delete | Didn‚Äôt work. No explanation why. Useless app.  Exactly what I‚Äôd expect from a government app | I entered Minnesota but there was no place to use the app, long line such a waste of time!!! | I set up this entry for my family and when we got to LAX, the line only had 15 people in it.  Huge win right?   Wrong.  Each person took at LEAST 5 minutes to get through the immigration officer, and the like took longer than friends who went through the normal line that had 300 people in front of them.  Was beyond annoyed after a 12 hour flight, thinking this would be faster, and it was a disaster.   No idea why, but on this trip, using the mobile passport app was a disaster.   Instead I‚Äôve applied for global entry. | Security would not allow me to pull the app up on my phone or stand in the MPC line, then while standing in the customs line, their ‚Äúfree airport Wi-Fi ‚Äú and the ‚Äúfree accessible border security Wi-Fi‚Äù would not connect without an I.D. and password, no instructions were provided for either, so an absolutely useless and frustrating experience. Do not waste your time. If airports aren‚Äôt going to ensure and allow access to the app and use of Wi-Fi, just stop advertising this app and go back to paper. | Everytime I get in the MPC line it takes longer than the normal line. Typically only one agent at the MPC booth | So easy to set up and use. Fly through customs. | The flight staff pushed us into a line then refused to let us use the express lanes because we didn‚Äôt show them the app before we got in line | Came into Newark recently, made my submissions with all the families pics and passports and then the agent said he didn‚Äôt see any of it loaded into the system. What‚Äôs the point? | I took my first international trip in 10 years and someone recommended this app and I‚Äôm glad I listened.  I had a 1 hr 20 minute layover in Atlanta and would have not made my connection had I not had this app.  I went to the head of the line at immigration and it took me all of 20 seconds to be on my way. | Love this step before arrival, very easy to use application. | This app is literally TERRIBLE  The people who work at the airport HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO HELP WITH EVER!!!!! Waste of time EVERY SINGLE TIME | Superb | It doesn‚Äôt help when airport has MPC lines closed. Just standing in line like everyone else | Had to use two different phones in order to submit CBP form. Kept getting error with the first phone. Tried with the 2nd phone and it submitted. | Needed to update the app | Great interface and super convenient ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Quick. Easy. Efficient. Helpful staff. | It works! So simple and saves a ton of time | Maybe just a Texas airport phenomenon, but the MPC lanes are never staffed, the line is always crazy long and my having completed the MPC app is always a waste of time. What good is this app if CBP doesn‚Äôt use it??  And if this is the solution to ridiculous lines, why not have more than 2 officers working at a time and, just maybe, use the MPC app you created for this purpose‚Ä¶? | This app is not in use at the Denver International Airport. I asked a CBP agent, who chuckled and said that they were set up to use it once, but they no longer have any scanners or other equipment. 

This matches the experience of other reviewers, where there are signs at the airport and expectations set by the app that it will save you time, but there is not an actual use case here.

The app itself however was easy to use. | Lane was closed.  Dumb | Doesn‚Äôt save time all passengers go to the same line. Don‚Äôt waste the memory. | Made my trip routine so easy! I‚Äôm in Love !! | Why state that you offer a service if you don‚Äôt offer the service. There‚Äôs a reason why people join a service like MPC and there‚Äôs others who will pay for Global Entry and there‚Äôs those that won‚Äôt sign up for either. But you don‚Äôt stick those that sign up for MPC in the same lines as those that don‚Äôt sign up for anything. If I miss my connection flight to Ohare out of Dallas this is your fault and I expect to be comped for the hassle. This is uncalled for and ridiculous. | Works great! | Incredible. Cheat code! | Worked seamlessly for my entry from Jamaica via Miami International Airport. The officer did retake my picture, which I figured might happen after reading another review ‚Äì the one I took with the app kept snapping the picture waaay too close. 
Anyway, I'll continue to use this app and dodge the long line every time! I was literally first walking in. | Intuitive app very user-friendly - we used it traveling from Mexico back to the USA. So far so good. Will update when we get thru US Customs‚Ä¶ | I love this | Excellent, convenient and efficient | Filling the form inside the plane is kind stressful when you have no pen to use and less light for

Insane profit-seeking price, and especially since the app doesn‚Äôt even work that well. | Why cant I send a message to people that have volunteered at some place and left a review? | This app is very easy to use and helps the aspiring world traveler to feel comfortable with applying for jobs and new experiences in new places :) | I‚Äôve heard so many great things about Worldpackers and I‚Äôve been trying to apply but their app has been glitching and I‚Äôve been fighting with it for an hour trying to be able to sign up and it just won‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed because this is something that I wanted to do for a while. | I love everything about the app and opportunities it brings and the plans are so worth it. The only issue/bug I wish they‚Äôd fix in the app is I have favorited hosts that closed their position and I have no way to unfavorite it and it just takes up room. | If it was life time payment would be better like cough-surfing but still looks interesting to me like a traveler! Thanks | We foreigners spend thousands of dollars to go and meet people, but in return we get treated like cattle, for example putting 7 people in small 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment. And if you say something you are wrong, yeah right paying to be wrong and to get treated like cattle. | Pay for the subscription and made my profile and literally nothing works. My profile never updates. it‚Äôs not even allowing me to apply to any places. ‚òπÔ∏è | Just updated, still NO tabs work, this is 0 functions app and should get a 0 star review. Very disappointed:( | This app/company is amazing! They do an incredible job of connecting willing and eager travelers with certified organizations and hostels to provide housing and other amenities in exchange for some form of agreed upon work. It is a great way to travel if you‚Äôre not afraid of doing things on the cheaper side along with being in a constant state of meeting and interacting with new and interesting people! | I love to backpack and this app helped me make a bunch of dreams come true and is continuing to do so, if you are a traveler this can be one of the best apps you can ever download | This app is everything that I was looking for and more, my dreams are becoming true thanks to this app. | Something is wrong with this app, it‚Äôs not working, anything I try to do it gives me a ops error message. | The app is very easy to use. Some of the features are a little confusing, but after I contacted with some questions I understand completely why they‚Äôre like that now. Great app and communication with the team.

Something went wrong :( Please try again later. | Um aplicativo completo cheio de conte√∫dos e com total seguran√ßa | The app itself is fine but I cannot get notifications to quit, despite them being turned off inside the app as well as in phone settings. And not just actual notifications but also push-ad type stuff for memberships. It‚Äôs frustrating but hopefully just a bug that can get corrected in an update. | I have been volunteering almost an year with you.It is been fantastic and helpful.

I would just be recommending to add one more answer to public comment,from the volunteers,not just one :) 
(I‚Äôve got a untruthful comment from 
A stressed host and could not replay in order to don‚Äôt affect my profile ..) | Worldpackers is unlike any other travel app on the market. The promise is engaging and straightforward‚Äî lend your talents and skills in exchange for an experience in a new community. 

For $49 you get full access to certification courses that can help you learn more about the roles and opportunities you can request in and bolster your profile for maximum engagement with your future host. The user interface is responsive and easy to navigate for first time guests and those with low computer literacy. 

The chat feature is effective and allows you to directly engage with the host of your choice in a safe and secure way. There are many ways you can stand out and showcase your skills and talents, which helps you better align with meaningful opportunities. 

If you are a creative, conscientious and curious traveler I highly recommend this app. | So I‚Äôm planning an upcoming trip to Latin America. Very excited to try out Worldpackers for the first time and psyched by all the things I‚Äôve read about it.

The review is purely for the app itself. When I go to the Academy section, nothing I click on works, even the Continue Watching intro series on ‚ÄúHow to be an outstanding worldpacker‚Äù. I basically have to go to the mobile site to watch.

Everything else works fine but when a whole tab malfunctions it‚Äôs kind of a bummer. I downloaded it yesterday too so I know I have the latest version. | Muito bom | WorldPackers really changed my life. I had the best experiences through them. There‚Äôs a lot of amazing hosts and thanks to the reviews, I know what I‚Äôm getting myself into. I haven‚Äôt had a bad experience and will continue to keep using the service. The App is just great to have instead of constantly logging back in through the browser and it‚Äôs easy to navigate. | The app itself holds all the information but it‚Äôs not very device friendly on my opinion.  It‚Äôs hard to narrow down opinions and then has gotten buggy as well, but other that that it‚Äôs good for the little that it offers and keeping in touch with the other members.

Not good for searching opportunities at all in my opinion | I was really excited to find this program, and so I went ahead and paid the membership fee. After using it for a few hours I noticed a few issues that could be fixed for UI. For example, when you open a position and you read under activities, it gets cut off in the bottom. I also noticed when I was inputting my background info the text would run off to the side and get cut off as well. I may consider just using the website instead but so far it‚Äôs been fine. | Worldpackers collects $50 from travelers by selling a false expectation that people can get free stays in exchange of volunteer ‚Äúwork‚Äù which they pitch in a way that doesn‚Äôt sound like work. We were a host on the platform and the first 5 travelers who came really had no interest whatsoever in working at all. The first traveler wanted to tour the island the second day of work, the second traveler never showed up, the third one ended up upgrading to a paid room once they understood there was volunteer work involved otherwise and the fourth went on vacation after two days of volunteering. Don‚Äôt waste your $50 for the false hope they sell you. If you‚Äôre truly interested in volunteer work, all the NGOs including our our NGO have websites that advertise for volunteer positions. You can Google and you will find them at no cost to you. | I went to browse, it‚Äôs been a over a year since I logged in, and my entire app is blank. I‚Äôm getting a user error | App is easy to navigate | Very useful and easy to play with | I downloaded the app for the first time today. Unfortunately I was not able to signup with Facebook. When I tried to use email signup, I got stuck at giving my birth date. The datePicker somehow shows blank and I was not able to pick my birth date on the picker so I couldn‚Äôt complete the signup process. What‚Äôs good about this app if user can‚Äôt signup and use it? :( | Scam duh | I‚Äôm tired of traveling app like this that tout Verification by payment of a subscription or fees. That‚Äôs only verifying I‚Äôm paying for membership services not because I or anyone else is a safe trustworthy person! Where are the requirements for background checks? Personal references? Of both parties. 
Also, if I can only find one or two opportunities (with no guarantees I‚Äôll get either host spot) and have no plans on making this a yearly lifestyle why should I pay $50 for it?!!! Ridiculous!
App doesn‚Äôt state membership required to apply for position! | Hello, i like your apps idea and what it entails. I would very much be interested in seeking a collaboration as a consultant of NGOs! | N√£o tenho palavras para agradecer a esse aplicativo, estou simplesmente realizando meus sonhos. | Very beneficial to travelers! | I found a few cool sounding opportunities but read the reviews and found 1 star reviews that detailed being manipulated or abused by their host. I‚Äôm confused why those listings are still allowed to be up and now suspicious of the safety of any of the ones on the app since it seems like there is a carelessness towards potential travelers by not removing unsafe situations or screening hosts.

edit: now with the latest updates the app won‚Äôt even load | So, I recently found out that you can become and expert workdpacker and they had programs you could sign up for etc. So I'm logged in and go to check out the programs and it tells me to ""log in to apply""

I already am logged in? Anyways, I click the button to log in and it takes me to the log in screen so I login through facebook and it takes me back to the home screen. So I go to click on my profile page where it has the ""Become and expert"" button and it logs me out of my account. So naturally I log back in and it's just a never ending cycle. It says I'm logged in but when I go to check out the expert programs it says I'm not when I AM. It even logs me out when I go to click on my profile. I would like to become and expert but the app keeps saying I'm not logged in and I haven't logged in when I am c l e a r l y on my account. Fix it, please, it's very frustrating. | It is not letting me upload my profile phone. | Best app ever! Ux is great, there are lots of opportunities in all over the world... i will definitely recommend to my NGO | Amazing App. Shared Economy. Impact. The Best Social Travel Network. Congratulations. | App muito bom. | What about paid if they going to let you work really hard you should get paid as well | It does make you pay 50$ but that‚Äôs nothing in exchange for what it offers you! I bought the full version and now I‚Äôm doing what I love full time ! | This app requires a $50 yearly membership, which I find ridiculous.  HelpX.net does the same job and gives the option of donating $30 for a two-year membership‚Äî a membership for which I was more than happy to pay m when I saw how helpful the site is. | App seems to go smoothly until you try connecting with a host and the app wanta $50 per year for a verification app. Total spoof | The concept of the app is great but it's so limited. I wish I could make my own profile and list all the skills I can offer besides just the languages that I know. The notifications get annoying when people comment the same topic as I did and there's no way to turn them off unless I uninstall the app. | Muito ruim | I like the app, but even after the update, the search feature is still so limited. 

I would love to be able to search keywords so that I can find, for example, work on a vineyard in Argentina as opposed to looking through all 500 Argentina jobs, sifting through housekeeping and front desk work at hostels. Everything else runs fluidly, but the search options need to be optimized. Searching by keyword, sorting by host rating, etc etc. | Exchange your skills for accommodation it's easy and fun with this app, direct and with many options, it's a no brain app to stay installed on your phone. | Is the best way to have meaningful travel experiences, meet people from all over the world and explores awesome places.";4.87554;2764;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/fd/87/72/fd877210-e786-9b4a-9578-8868366cd9ae/3d8db89b-398a-42d2-891c-416bb520cdbd_29.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e3/f4/1e/e3f41e76-8997-7259-e559-b200a45c9c18/15583c64-a93c-493b-9f1c-f7087e1c7750_32.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/8b/fc/cb/8bfccb06-d764-bed8-c50e-af5e6c539d43/7e44e58a-ebfb-48fb-ad1f-0ca0c0e80acf_36.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/e8/55/5fe85542-6bfc-7b4e-9978-c578848cbaf0/341ff946-d4d9-44fd-ae06-5d652df1e7f1_34.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/97/52/02/97520223-165e-bf09-4734-bc35967f0ad8/f6d58b34-6f88-4251-9b0f-36b80a7a9bf8_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6b/9b/c5/6b9bc5e5-937f-fccb-5334-81b94190a040/3085ce48-5455-4770-ad0a-5529ea5c5446_33.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]";"[]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I used this app for the run index and now it‚Äôs no where to be found. | No matter how hard I try this Commie app keeps giving me alerts in Celcius! This is America, where our numbers are in English! Thank You | I HATE this lastest update. All the text is either too small or does not have good contrast. Visually and graphically it is just not effective.  Please make updates!! | I loved the old layout with the run score easily accessed on the main page. Now it looks like I‚Äôll have to make an account? This is ridiculous. I don‚Äôt want to create an account just to see what the run conditions will be in the next week. Bring back the old layout, it was fine. They also put all 15 min forecasts behind a paywall which is b.s. This app has gone way downhill over the last decade and I‚Äôm about ready to delete it entirely and go with something else for my main weather forecasts. I don‚Äôt mind seeing ads, but putting basic features that used to be free behind a paywall is one way to make me give up on it entirely. | I love this app and it is generally pretty accurate‚Ä¶ however i miss having the sunrise sunset function on my Apple Watch. It used to be an option to have on the phone available in the watch face categories. Can you please bring that back? | There are too many ads and muffles the real reason why I have the app! With inflation, I can‚Äôt add another expense! I may have to delete the app for something else | I‚Äôve been looking for a good weather app to replace the Weather Bug app. It looks as if I‚Äôve truly found the best one(so far). | All I wanted to do was check the weather for Saturday and it kept blocking it with an ad!! | What a mess ‚Äî the last great update.  You took the best weather app ant turned it into a landscape only view of a weather radar.  There are great radar apps out there.  This is not one of them and the rest of the weather info is now a small section on the right side and difficult to use.  Sad to say, I deleted this app.  Multiple other apps now so much better. | Me gusta mucho la utiliz√≥ desde hace varios a√±os üëèüèªüòÖ | When I open the app all I get is adds. When I go to check the weather I expect the weather not adds | okay so i downloaded this app and i was think why would i download a new weather app and then i put in my settings blah blah blah, this is what really makes me wonder what you guys are yapping about ‚Äúthis app not being good enough‚Äù, you can pick your own ads, and they decided to have ads, it‚Äôs not that big of a deal, i find the ad very entertaining, you can pick what ads you want or what your news articles are about. in my conclusion this is a very good weather indicator, love it. | i like the weather app because i don‚Äôt lile storms or when ot gets cloudy out so it makes me know what it happinging | Radar = Dark Mode | Screen foes not refesh correctly.  Can‚Äôt trust the weather prediction i am looking at until i tag another item then come back to the one i actually need.  Not a big fan of new updated app | Done with your website, putting full screen ads up and the x to close it is half off screen. Done with stupidity | Version: 14.2‚Ä¶..I do like the layout of the recent update and I appreciate the developer trying to make improvements to the app. However it is not the weather app that I go to as every time I open it, it takes 15 seconds for the app to open. I literally have timed it! I am paying for the premium service but will downgrade unless App opens quicker.  Please developers if you can improve this, it would definitely be my go to Weather app. Thanks a bunch | The new version is much worse than it was. It‚Äôs not user-friendly anymore. We‚Äôre going to find something else. | I purchased this app for the weather not for politics or your take on COVID / health issues. Stick to the weather please. | I love it | Love the new upgrade! | Always keeps me informed of how to dress and how to prepare for the day. Always sends my warnings. I Love ‚ù§Ô∏è it!! | Widgets reveal no information. Always blank | They're accurate with the temperature about half the time, rain forecasting is a joke as is snow (their wives must be disappointed, they promise 9-12"" and maybe 3"" is what they actually mean). Why would I pay for premium when you can't even get the free version to be accurate, let alone having to watch ads to see the weather. I can get it for free on other apps that are more accurate | Good app was ruined by new format. | Am I crazy that this app now forces landscape mode? Is this a setting I don‚Äôt know how to turn off? Making a mediocre app even worse‚Ä¶ | Not really digging the new app. To many changes. Biggest problem, currently for me, is My Places aren‚Äôt showing up. I used to have a list of cities in the old app that I kept up with. It was quick and easy to check the weather in other cities. In the new app, I can search for the cities and save them but I never see them in the list of My Places. When I go back and try to select the same city it tells me that city is already saved to My Places. Why didn‚Äôt it show up in the list? | So many woke articles and videos pushed though notifications.  Please just send out notifications for weather and don‚Äôt push out videos promoting the vaccine... what a joke of an app. | The New & Improved website is fantastic. More options & up to the minute üòé | Killed it, folks!  much more available and speedy!  LOVE IT! | Before you changed the appearance I‚Äôd have given the app a 5 star, now just a 3 rating. Please go back to the original vertical configuration for iPads. Why did you change it? The app is not as user friendly and I don‚Äôt need 3/4 of the screen showing radar! | Never rely on this dogsh*t app, but lets be honest‚Äî reviews mean nothing except in the thousands. | Ever since the app has changed, notifications do not properly clear after reading them. I have to open notifications at least several times before it finally clears. I truly miss the previous version, which I had no issues with. | Really dislike the new look, no I really hate it. The moving clouds, or lightening and rain, going on in the background is really a distraction. I don‚Äôt see a way to turn that off. The layout is not the same. Toggling from one thing to another first takes you to a time screen. Awful. | I haven‚Äôt been able to find any videos on the app in the past few weeks with an anchor or reporter talking. Everything is now just video with no audio, instead having subtitles that you have to read. This has made the video watching experience on the app much worse than in the past. Also, premium videos aren‚Äôt released often anymore. We used to get deep dives anytime there was a severe weather threat, or would get to see other fun topics covered by meteorologists, but now we‚Äôre lucky if we get a video once every three weeks. | Prior to the March 2024 release, this app was reasonably accessible to people with print disabilities using voiceover, apples text to speech utility. The new release, however, has several issues; here are just two of them.

The table of hourly data on the home tab presents vertically, if following logic. However, voiceover reads the table horizontally, which makes no sense to the user. That can be corrected by developers.

Next, the icons on the second row in the same table that have alt text, as they should, contain underscores between each word, rather than spaces. Thus the user hears the word ""_"" between each word, which is beyond annoying.

I hope this can be corrected, along with any other issues a thorough developer review might reveal using voiceover, before August 2024, when my premium subscription is scheduled to renew. | Love using this over apples weather app. It's more accurate every time. It crashes on me a lot  tho | Not only does the app crash everytime I open it. It‚Äôs never accurate. I use to use this app to plan my scheduling for my business. They claim rain for a certain day with a high percentage and then when the morning of the weather will switch from rain to sunshine. It‚Äôs screwed me up so many times. So every time I see rain in the forecast 90% of the time it will be a sunny beautiful day. For example all this week it was saying today (3/15) was 78% chance of rain. So I planned accordingly. This morning when I woke up and checked the weather it went from 78% rain and clouds  to 10% change to partly cloudy and sunshine and so far it‚Äôs been a sunny day. Switched to another weather app and I‚Äôll never redownload this again. | I‚Äôve loved this app for years, but the new version makes it so hard to clear notifications. I‚Äôve muted most other than severe weather because of it. For now I‚Äôll rely on other apps for timely notifications. | Thank you for making your app worse every time you redesign it.  Nothing makes my happier than having to click 734 times to get to a notification and then have it refuse to go away.  Please double the $30 a year I pay for your app so I can finally cancel it and delete it.  What are you people thinking??? | The new update makes it more difficult to see the weather. They should go back to the way it was. | Delayed refresh is super annoying have to quit the app and relaunch at times | I have the paid version and it constantly is logging me out when I go back to the app. | This app is very slow on iOS. I used it on android and it was much faster. 
I also hate the way the little widgets change position every time I open the app. | Used to be good, now terrible. It‚Äôs slow, clunky, and is now more advertising than actual weather. They need to just roll back to their previous UI | I totally object to having to provide personal information for the sake of personalizing the app, including the requirement of sharing my location to Weather Channel advertising partners. This is unskippable and means I will be deleting this app. Someone at TWC has decided that my privacy is worth nothing. | This app is amazing, accurate, always on time, and trusted my many. Very reliable! | Go back to the old version. When you were in the radar you were able to use it so much easier. when clicking on the map in a place where there was weather alerts. it would just tell you. especially in the severe outlook. now you can‚Äôt use the radar like you used too | Accurate, app is easy to understand and very informative. | High percentage on forecast. Very dependable to the hour. Love the precipitation alerts.";4.72286;3747956;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/e4/5b/23/e45b23c4-7b1c-eb88-0b94-c0fcf5f8a163/9527903a-162a-4e6a-b199-b36803cf0b67_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/23/10/1b/23101ba8-ebae-b112-60d9-70437377d05c/c44ae527-0955-4525-8b65-51640ba573d1_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-2__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/b8/99/2d/b8992d0a-b05d-c0b1-2be7-a98373777674/902a6e61-eb29-462a-9158-1a5e099406ed_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/4a/d2/74/4ad27474-225d-aa06-57b6-8ba6525eb2d7/f417f773-b878-4ea5-af89-ed152e82895f_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/2d/87/7e/2d877e24-398c-d534-592a-2701a68b7e09/ab664961-567c-4834-8b8b-51ac6f1de155_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/93/8b/40/938b4076-24e2-fae1-2a46-fa9d92dc43c2/f864260d-c853-48d9-96ee-50ff62db1c9a_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/8d/e8/5f/8de85f03-19f7-8bba-aeb5-36fde61a38c1/5b708541-4029-4371-b0bf-901dfb957d00_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/86/8e/5a/868e5a60-68aa-41d5-d7a2-984ddd5f5d40/f2fb2954-b9f2-4a40-af12-ac2389e58a7a_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/38/d9/3a/38d93a4d-cddf-bd6f-baa9-d0c1b369b631/8b9deef1-0d89-43f5-a287-eb2ba722c32d_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-9.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/64/83/7c/64837ce5-1fa8-59d5-4738-a899e0183bdf/a2cfecb8-1716-494e-8a90-381ace01b50f_TWC_iOS_5.5_en-US_1242x2208-10.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/ef/dc/75/efdc7587-786c-e4b2-5315-0b5b26bfa21d/057a6e25-2d02-488d-955b-6357089647ac_TWC_iOS_iPad_en-US_2732x2048-1__U00281_U0029.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/67/88/13/678813d0-f008-657e-9c62-4b95eef35148/0689d2bb-6c30-4c3f-8922-4804f6b51fef_TWC_iOS_iPad_en-US_2732x2048-2.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/c6/8c/85/c68c8562-8b1f-f4bc-61bb-26d1c935d804/dbce2972-a34e-4011-9cd5-2287bf526a0d_TWC_iOS_iPad_en-US_2732x2048-3.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/41/c2/a3/41c2a3e3-15aa-618a-51f5-47a6d6d5651d/0599079d-bc00-4a66-8f8c-ac82e46bf9ee_TWC_iOS_iPad_en-US_2732x2048-4.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/c8/cf/b1/c8cfb17b-778a-5541-4a8c-029b8912f260/0121b825-711d-47b0-8b79-249c0203fa01_TWC_iOS_iPad_en-US_2732x2048-5.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/9a/18/0d/9a180d9c-c8bd-3c44-6bad-2a3145b51920/def13dad-b522-4ad0-8c95-5cb61e181dbe_TWC_iOS_iPad_en-US_2732x2048-6.png/552x414bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEig

They are cheaper and app is much much easier to use. | really easy to use it only took 3 minutes for me to complete my booking. | Easy procedures and competitive pricing, keep up with the good work | I wouldn‚Äôt trust this app I got scammed for 1250 dollars I haven‚Äôt been reimbursed till this day be careful with this app | I booked my flight in March and the booking was confirmed soon after. I didn‚Äôt find out until a month prior that my booking changed and I wasn‚Äôt able to verify the change (thankfully the airport attendants were more than accommodating) but when I checked in on the return at first Air Canada didn‚Äôt even register that I had a connecting flight and then I almost had to pay for the same bag twice on my connecting flight (again the airport attendants saved me here as well) when I tried to talk to an agent i received only bots except once and even then they weren‚Äôt very helpful. This app has only lead to frustration and headaches for me. | Low cost flights and easy to use the app .I highly recommend using this app if you like to save money and find flights fast.üëçA | This app canceled my flight without my consent, with zero explanation. 

I then reached out to their support, switching from email to text per their demand. I gave them my confirmation number. My phone number. My email. My phone. 

Then they put me on a long hold, while asking ‚Äúare you still there‚Äù on a text chat. 

Then ‚Äúfor my security‚Äù they said they wouldn‚Äôt assist me without giving tons of additional personal info, after I already gave the above. This isn‚Äôt about security. It‚Äôs not for convenience. It‚Äôs a massive inconvenience to repeat all of this information repeatedly. 

It‚Äôs surveillance. It‚Äôs extortive. 

Spend your money elsewhere. 

All this could have easily been solved with one email- when they said they canceled my flight, via email, they could have simply stated why, in that email. 

They are choosing to provide poor service then being petty saying ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt help without tons of unnecessary information‚Äù which is not the truth. | Tried 2 months the app is not working at all. Search is not loading | Very poor service, they don‚Äôt have any customer service on call, chat only. Whoever chat agent they don‚Äôt know anything. They took my half day and problem still is there. | I was trying to book a flight to Orlando but the app crashes and it never loads anything. Uninstalling right away. | Great app but will refresh in the middle of checkout if u stay too long | Easy app to use | Excellent price and great service | They charges fees even with claimed free cancellation within 24 hour. Department of transportation rules and laws don't apply to them because they are a third party sales reps stations in Canada. Just book directly from the airline, they are bind by the law with no fees and full refund. The price is also the same. | We missed our flight due to typhoon flooding out of Manila. South Korea Airlines said there was a flight we could catch if Justfly switched our booking in order to make our connection. Justfly declined to help. My wife and I, with our 16 month old baby, we‚Äôre completely stranded. Again, Korean Air said Justfly could have saved the day but they didn‚Äôt. We will never book with them again. | Fast, trustworthy and very convenient service! | The title usually doesn‚Äôt go together high quality low price; however, with just fly that‚Äôs just what I got, a high quality low price airfare and hotel. | It was quick and simple to understand, thanks so much üëå | My ticket was really inexpensive and the booking was effortless with no problems. I‚Äôve used other cheap booking sites and have been disappointed. But I will be using justify again and again!!! Mahalo | Justfly.com has the best price on travel flights. App is user friendly. | Will never book s flight with them anymore. If you want to spend your time calling between justfly and the airline go ahead and book your ticket with them. They are the worst and wasted my time. | Excellent! | Great app in the past.  Stopped working last week after I installed the latest IOS update.  Doesn‚Äôt work in app or on website on my IPad.   Was it the software update and Justfly hasn‚Äôt caught up? Or something else‚Ä¶hmmm | do not trust this application | My favorite air tickets app ‚Ä¶ I have been using justify for past 15 years for me and my family.. love the service and price ..  best price | This was easy and saved money and time. üëç | The best price!!!! | Excellent service. Very easy to book. | Got me tickets on Hawaiian Airlines HNL-TYO in 10 days when HA website gave me errors in three browsers.  Seat selection fee is annoying, but a small amount. | Very reasonable airfares. 
Vinaka!! | Great flights prices. Could never go wrong. | One of the baddest app the system is error when I was booking flights supposed to be my actual date supposed to be on February 20 2023 somehow after I come from my booking surprise me when I see my flight on March 22, 2023 when I contacted the customer service I spent over 2 hours on hold on the phone and not getting the result fixed !!! Makes me ended up, contact my bank to dispute the money or they said, if you wanna make the correct change, you will to pay a lot of penalty fees, or you have to wait up 21 days which is not fair at all  ‚Ä¶.. | I can log into my account via a browser on line, but I cannot log in using the app? What‚Äôs that all about ? It just doesn‚Äôt work and I cannot reset a password either ? Please fix the app. | Thank you so much for cheap airfare, easy booking‚ù§Ô∏èü§ôüèº | I had the worst experience ever booking through this just fly.com. They changed one of my flights randomly and I can never get in touch with the customer care to inquire the reason. Now I'll have to lay over in one place for 14 hours (instead of 2.30 hrs as per my original booking). They are asking me to pay another $1900 to change it back to my original booking. It's a scam. Terrible. There should be a class action lawsuit if this happened to others. I'll never go though this one again nor I'll ever recommend this experience to anyone. | Not sure if this is a ‚Äúme‚Äù issue, but the app totally stopped giving me results of search. The page loads and loads for hours, no joke, hours. And nothing comes up. | Please update the app, it‚Äôs extremely glitchy and I can‚Äôt access any information I need. | Unusable‚Ä¶the app crashes on every login attempt | I booked with this company, I had insurance next thing I know I couldn‚Äôt fly the day I supposed to fly. I called then to do anything, cancel, change the fly they said no  this fly is take it or loose I was so mad, I called the insurance to try to get my money back nada ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ | I booked two different tickets for my family to come to my college graduation and instead they booked it vice versa. I went and checked numerous times what i typed from the history and I was right but for check in on the airline it was appearing vice versa. When I called them they told me they could not give me any money back and I had to rebook. My mom had to take a loan out for everybody to see my graduation and it messed up my grad gift. I have told literally everyone I know to delete this app and they have will never use again. | Never had any issues with the flights I‚Äôve booked through Justfly. It‚Äôs usually my go-to site. However, the app itself is pretty bad, quite glitchy and can‚Äôt do anything on it. I just end up going on the web page. App seems pretty pointless if it‚Äôs not working properly. | I loved this app , and I used it quite a few times and I found the best of the best deals , but unfortunately it‚Äôs not displaying the results for my flight searches , I hope that they can fix up this issue! | Im Back buying tickets to fly with you guys, BUT
I had problems in the past.
I hope don‚Äôt have problems again.. | This app deserves less than 1 star! I don‚Äôt usually give ratings for apps but had to leave a review after this. JUSTFLY is a SCAM. They take your money and cancel your flight. My wife and I went to the airport just for the airline to say that we were nowhere in their system even though we had an itinerary from JUSTFLY. We had to come out of our pockets $1000 just to get another ticket. Tried calling customer service but they do NOT answer the phone. This is ridiculous and these people should not be in business. | Great and easy process and got a great deal on my flight !!!!! | They will NOT issue refunds whatsoever if you cancel. I got the travel protection plan, however I got sick a few days prior to my flight and I‚Äôve been trying to get a refund from them since January 2022. No luck yet. | This app is no good at all, I booked an tickets from here is all way Delay and the customer service is very bad.";4.86043;29493;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/cf/8f/6e/cf8f6ed5-bf2e-5684-2899-15732e59e960/eacb0608-423e-4976-b082-0a1284f24056_iOS_6.5_-_1_V6__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ab/3e/98/ab3e9805-6367-e48c-8157-a663c04ad61f/24374b3b-d818-44a4-ad10-f1fba553ccfa_iOS_6.5_-_2_V6__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ca/18/cd/ca18cdf8-e0b9-7434-aea9-2ce7495f9c20/179b50d7-63d2-4527-b1a0-b91743f37eca_iOS_6.5_-_3_V6__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c8/8d/62/c88d6230-ec9e-d3bc-bda9-58b351eded6c/2db0e76c-5f22-4b4f-9f94-f88809227090_iOS_6.5_-_4_V6__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/3a/86/c8/3a86c81b-56ba-c991-ab4d-bfe567ca8586/9699d5d6-7bbc-452c-b5a7-4de326860381_iOS_6.5_-_6_V6__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/99/8e/92/998e9297-91b8-31cc-b010-814bb3fa4757/a2e11129-a07c-4694-b31d-93a90bb9d57a_iOS_6.5_-_7_V6__U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/9d/c9/bd/9dc9bd81-f18e-39be-4f21-fa8148037780/eeef59e8-5bc7-4897-8f55-0acc247223dd_iOS_6.5_-_1_V6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a6/34/52/a634528b-edcb-efba-3057-7e8c2f79092f/34ebc20b-6f0d-446c-9bcc-aeaaa67253a1_iOS_6.5_-_2_V6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/16/ca/ee/16caeecf-d4e6-15fb-cf1d-98c9907d8dd1/56a9eee9-8935-431d-a3d5-eac2395fb3c2_iOS_6.5_-_3_V6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/31/21/a7/3121a76d-b336-d9a4-85e3-89a208ca1356/4b210f72-a257-4bd9-ae21-8e5fa5072abe_iOS_6.5_-_4_V6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0c/71/02/0c7102f7-5e37-37fe-fd91-0d38ef415662/df8e073b-9b54-41c7-87a6-d2affcfa705c_iOS_6.5_-_6_V6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9b/58/e7/9b58e72d-731f-a7bf-7d31-b9bc86ef260f/e9a6d105-c99d-4463-9cf1-ab5aaaca859c_iOS_6.5_-_7_V6.png/576x768bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11Fourt

My family fit very well The heated seats work great. We enjoyed our time !!! | It is good app in first view but it is car host dependent. In car rental companies you can go anytime and return it at anytime. However here that is not the case. If you want to return early or pickup early then it is not easy.  I felt is is pain to coordinate. I tried once but next time I would use rental car company not Turo. Price wise Turo was little costlier. | This app allows me access to late model vehicles in that are not offered by the main rental companies.  And the owners are very nice! | Turo is the best car renting platform out there! | If you are looking for a car to rent try Turo you won‚Äôt be disappointed! | Hooked on Turo ! | I rented a car from someone on this app. I had the decency to wash it and fill the tank before returning it. I took pictures because I know how people work. They'll try to come after you for any amount of money they can. The guy tried charging me for a full tank of gas. I sent him and Turo time stamped pictures of the gas gauge (full) 

Well, Turo didn't even want to investigate my side because they get a portion of anything he makes so they just automatically honored the guys request for more money and charged my account. 

I took it to better business bureau where the Turo  representative just copied and pasted the same response saying ""we've looked into it and the owner of the car is right."" Then the case was ultimately close. 

The point is, after your trip, if they want more money from you they're gonna get it no matter what because Turo gets a portion and there's nothing you can do about it. 

Every one's always trying to rip you off. | This app, depending on your city has a variety of vehicles for great pricing as well as discounted pricing the longer you have it. I experienced a lot of vehicles I can‚Äôt have at the moment. All Around great app and easy to navigate and use. | This app is very easy to use and pretty helpful staff. | My girlfriend and I just finished our second trip with Turo.  We had another great experience.  If you aren‚Äôt super picky about the kind of car you drive, Turo is a cost-effective way to rent! | Must get app if you need to get around | This is better than a rental counter, but it does come with its downfalls. The biggest being, if you want to add an hour to you reservation, they charge you for a WHOLE DAY!!! Cmon Turo, you can prorate the costs for an hour or two! When people come in and leave on flights, it‚Äôs not at the same time. Out bound flight may be at a later time than inbound, so there‚Äôs no reason to charge for a full day! Even my host said that is absurd and he told me if I was late that it was ok. 

The service fees are also a huge factor. They tell you that your trip will be $xxx and then when you go to checkout, they add this fee and that fee and next thing you know, it‚Äôs over $100 more than when you‚Äôre browsing. CAN EVERYONE STOP WITH THE ADDED FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES?!?! It really is insanity to have to pay over $100 in service fees! 

The good‚Ä¶..I have rented two times and both have been seamless aside from the above mentioned. Both hosts were quick with responses and provided a quality vehicle. | Great communication. It‚Äôs not contactless but very efficient exchange. | Good so far. | Great car and easy check in and out! Until next time | Easy to use real time replies from hosts | I‚Äôve had really bad experiences via app. Just be careful of scammers and don‚Äôt trust anyone. | Insurance charge was hidden and will not credit back.  I have my own car insurance and would never elect for extra redundant coverage.  They will not credit | Top notch! Easy to use. | Super nice and comfortable Tesla Car thank you so much to be so gentle with me. Thanks again. | Great communication, easiest possible check in and check out, and the Jeep Grand Cherokee was in excellent condition.
Highly recommend! | Great app | Best car rental experience. Use them whenever I travel. Best rates and service!! | I‚Äôm on my 4th rental from this company, have chosen a different vehicle each time and they have all been wonderful!!! | TURO, Has been a lifesaver for my family. We book a van every vacation for 30% less then the traditional rental car services. We enjoy the experience. | It has been a good experience but It is important to get bilingual (Spanish) speaking help support in order to make an improvement on the experience | We use Turo when we travel and are happy we discovered it. It's convenient, less expensive than the major companies. It also gives you a chance as a host, or as a guest, to meet new people.
So glad we found this company!
Come see us in Pensacola Florida and rent our 10 passenger van to tour around the beautiful sandy beaches, the emerald green water, the fantastic food and welcoming, southern hospitality. | The jeep itself was perfect. We had to wait 30 minutes in the parking garage for it to arrive even though they had our flight times. They then tried to stick us with a $20 parking garage fee after we had to leave the jeep in the garage since they couldn‚Äôt pick it up until we would be on our flight. We gave them our flight information a month in advance. | The res notifications with the # dont show on the app icon on my homepage and its rather frustrating always having to check the app to see.

Other than that, the functionality of the app works well. | I can‚Äôt speak for the drivers of Turo, but this platform does NOT support the vehicle owners.  My truck that I bought specifically to go on Turo was destroyed, smoked in, and left without gas or any cleaning. This all happened on various occasions over the course of 3 l-4 months with absolutely no help from Turo. On one occasion they denied a claim that my driver just paid me directly. It was a frustrating experience. | Great experience and  most definitely will continue to use it but I believe there should be a rewards program I‚Äôm like 4 k in already with Turo I need discounts lol | Great, easy, and smooth process! | One of the best rental companies I have ever seen | üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ | Really enjoy using this service. | We use this app and have had great experiences each time. So much cheaper than rental agencies and quicker too. Sometimes the rental companies at the airport have long lines. And they always try to upsell. Turo avoids all that. | Our trip using Turo was dynamite‚Ä¶great organization and fun trip! | I had over 10+ reviews all 5 stars and randomly Turo banned me and removed me without explanation. | Joey and his staff were professional and always available The car was clean and ready to go We would absolutely work and rent from them again Honest and pleasant | The App is Easy! I host vehicles on Turo and like the fact that I can make extra income and provide customer satisfaction with unique cars, different from other car rental companies. And, if I wanted to rent a car myself to make a car buying decision or just something fun is a definitely a plus. | Best rental car app and place to rent vehicles hands down | Streamlined app! | Love the App | I love Turo. It‚Äôs a nice way for me to make extra money. I like the entire platform. | The renting process is smooth but there was one incident where Turo completely dropped the ball so I always tell people rent at your own risk because if anything happens, the customer service agents and ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù are no help at all EVEN IF ITS THEIR FAULT. I only rent from Turo if my plans are flexible. Otherwise, I‚Äôll pay the extra money to rent from another place just to have that extra security and peace of mind. The one star rating is not because they dropped the ball, things happen‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs because of the way they handled (or didn‚Äôt handle rather) a situation that honestly could‚Äôve been avoided if the customer service was up to par. | Best rental service | And almost always very easy but generally always easy. Hosts are cool and the cars are always clean and always feel safe and are safe. | Great place to rent cars .! I love it | Fastest, easiest and most secure way to rent a car when traveling. Very convenient and affordable. | A substantial young driver fee is not added to your reservation until you go through the whole reservation process. This is thrown on by Turo for every vehicle.

Without boundaries expressed outright, you‚Äôll be flooded with hosts requests. Really shows the intentions of most hosts on the app. Have yet to meet another woman on it. | It functions ok on my iPhone but several things are strange, text fields overlapping, simply aesthetically off. I travel for a living and couch surfing has helped me to save money on hotels. I wish I there was a trip-routing feature on the app. | This app has given me wings to fly to Japan, Sweden, Germany, Kenya, Singapore, India and so many more places. 

I am eternally grateful to couchsurfing and the many wonderful people I met while on the journey. Live long and prosper, CS! | Excelente app para conocer, asistir y ayudar a amigos de todo el mundo. Los invito a conocer La Habana Vieja. Un abrazo desde Cuba. | It‚Äôs a great app for meeting friends and traveling new places. Unfortunately, you have to spend a lot of money to get verified, and the app is extremely buggy and poorly written. It frequently takes five seconds to do something very very simple. Or it will forget to notify you that you got a message. Very difficult and unpleasant to use. | Stole $60 from me over 6 years ago when I simply followed their instructions for verification. Never used the app after that because I won‚Äôt support scammers. They just tried running my credit card again. They should be charged with financial crimes. | This app is my favorite app of all time but I wish for using the app properly we wouldn‚Äôt need to make a payment | I‚Äôm not gonna pay for an app like this before i know if it works and isn't a scam. If you're gonna charge for your app charge in the app store, not after download and account setup. | When people ask me about Couchsurfing this is what I tell them‚Ä¶

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like visiting your favorite cousin who happens to live where you want to travel most!

The future people you‚Äôll meet on here, are the kindest souls you could ever find. 
 What greater show of kindness is there than welcoming a complete stranger into your most private space [your home] ??

My experience:

Pick up from the airport 
Cooking meals & being introduced to foods you‚Äôd never taste
Guitar serenades
Salsa dancing
Deep late conversations 
Laughs until the sun rises.

These precious people are Ambassadors of there cities & countries, & they give you there time so that you can simply enjoy‚Ä¶ | I‚Äôve hosted in the past and had great experiences with travelers. I payed a lump sum to get verified and had to send pictures of my place‚Ä¶ which I was fine with. Now they are asking for a fee every month. I‚Äôd be willing to pay something when I had a guest but not a fee each month no matter what. | It is truly the buggiest app I‚Äôve ever used, and they charge for it! Disappointing, can‚Äôt wait for a better alternative to create a competition for them. | This is the best app to know more about different cultures and languages we feel like a big family helping each others around the world 
I really advise everyone to use it and share it | Hice el pago del a√±o y no se porque en la aplicaci√≥n aparece un correo electr√≥nico que no es el m√≠o, cuando intento cambiarlo en la app para poder confirmar mi cuenta y poder avanzar no me permite cambiarlo | Search by area on map instead of running multiple searches for myriad municipalities that converge on a given zone. | The best app for travelers | Knew about Couchsurfing for many years when it was just a website. Reconnected to it now that I‚Äôm back traveling and through this app. Glad it exists! | The app has significant bugs (like you can‚Äôt login from different devices and I had to contact administrators in order to update my email).  A lot of users are inactive too.  I cancelled my subscription after a couple days.  Definitely not worth it. | Dont download, they stole from me 56 euros for verification!!

They dont want to refund | I just reported this place to the Better Business Bureau. They charged my credit card for a lifetime membership and now I cannot log back into my account because they say it‚Äôs inactive. I‚Äôm not sure if it was a lifetime or if it was a year, but the point is that is really shady. The verification was only supposed to verify my identity. This company is bad. | Used this since 2007. Now they charge $3 even if you are hosting. Scammers.
App is always buggy on iPhone. The new ownership severely neglects and the wuality deteriorates as more and more hosts leave and more and more freeloaders flood in. Sad. | If there‚Äôs a subscription fee for using the service why not just saying it instead of calling it ‚Äúdonation‚Äù? How can I trust a company playing tricks like this? | I submitted a request to surf with an ambassador of the couchsurfing app which was denied with no comment. When I requested again for different days and inquired if his denial, he did the same thing again. I go to his reviews and see only white people and people of Spanish descent, so of course, I took this to be racially motivated. I left a review stating that Winston will approve or deny your request based on race and that was removed as they considered it ‚Äúbullying and harassment.‚Äù I‚Äôve had several interactions such as this and couch surfing always seems to back up the racist, coincidence huh? | CouchSurfing and its community is what the World needs more of!! I started 10 years ago and it changed my life. Now about the app: The good: The app keeps getting better. Features are really useful. I love that you can read the communication history after joining a Hangout chat. The bad: Bugs with notifications, I get notified sometimes hours after messages are sent. The messaging in Hangouts feature is quite slow, people quickly move to WhatsApp. I wish the feature ""people traveling to your city"" would also be in the app, and not only on the website. | The first thing this app wants is a per month fee (or per year) or else u can‚Äôt use the app. Then they encourage u to spend $60 to get verified so you‚Äôll be able to find a host faster. I paid $60 + $15 yearly fee = $75. I sent about 20 requests to ~ 20 hosts in Los Angeles area. I was rejected by all 20. I suspect it‚Äôs b/c I am new to couch surfing and don‚Äôt have any references. 

But then it begs the question‚Ä¶ How do I get references if hosts will not accept me??!! My advice to travelers wanting to save money - spend money on a well rated hostel eg use the Hostel World app. The $75 I spent is easily a one night stay at a top rated hostel | So what I‚Äôm seeing is the movement has been hijacked my greedy people,, seeing as you can‚Äôt access ANYTHING without paying first, uh yeah that‚Äôs called a scam people run away lol | Don‚Äôt used 
Don‚Äôt like Muslim and Arabic people 
Please give home 1 stars all time | Don‚Äôt pay anything! It blames COVID for lack of activity but, it seems to be just a way to get money because you can‚Äôt access the app until you pay. Then, you see no one has been active for 3-9 years!! Even the reviews are old! Luckily, I only paid for one month. | There needs to be a way to see past hangouts and the people that attended them. | This is the best travel app for solo travelers. So many opportunities to meet new people and make friends all over the world. | You have to pay up front before you can check it out. I'm not subscribing to something before I even know anything about it. | As the title said CSing is an amazing experience and you can meet incredible people around the world. | Can‚Äôt even see how the app works because they need money . no thanks . | This app forces you to contribute a donation before you get to even see the Home Screen. | they charge you a monthly subscription fee just to browse. once i used the search feature i realized many of the hosts are not active and have not been in years | I recommend app, cs help me open USA | I probably wouldn‚Äôt mind contributing for a good experience that helps me build a local social network, but not before I can even try it. | After signing up you can't use the app unless you pay $4 a month or $15 a year‚Ä¶ 

Otherwise the only thing you could do is delete the account or logout‚Ä¶

 i'm sure the idea is nice‚Ä¶ 

But the execution is terrible. | They ban you for whatever reason. But they are quick to take your money and not giving back a refund. You‚Äôre all a bunch a lunatic thieves | TSIA. Unable to use. | 1 star! : Contributions should be voluntary. I can‚Äôt even see the portal without a subscription.
I won‚Äôt pay for something I haven‚Äôt seen or know if I want. | The party is over | How do you check out something when the only option is to subscribe? I see peoples reviews talking about charges.. really seems like a scam. I was really excited to see this app but nothing to see here ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Awesome üòé | Keeps refreshing itself before giving a ‚Äúsomething went wrong please try again later‚Äù I tried fully uninstalling and deleting all cached data | Every single time. Can't get in at all anymore. 100% of the time it crashes. | Can‚Äôt even search or check out the app without paying. Save yourself the time and don‚Äôt bother | They just want money and put COVID 19 as an excuse, don‚Äôt get it | Used to be a great thing. Shame on the owners for ruining a great community. | This application is a complete scam. Do your research.
Developers charging you $60.00 as a ‚Äúcard verification‚Äù.  Support refusing the refund. Absolute ignorance.
The application itself is lacking active userbase. Even in major cities, I was able to find about 10-15 active hosts. Most profiles are shown in the search were active 2-3 years ago.
It should be removed from the App
Store. | Today in Cartagena, I met a Couchsurfer who told me about this App. I immediately signed up and began using it. I wish I had known there was such an easy way to meet people while traveling before I arrived in Colombia!";4.58223;8208;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/87/c5/4b/87c54b8e-f3dc-274c-09a6-ee6db6d6cf5e/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/bd/89/dc/bd89dcad-8e82-e450-b50f-394363aba899/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/ae/11/42/ae11428f-3068-ac67-9aa8-42dc53236aa1/mzl.hgdwazkz.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/5f/57/77/5f57779b-d3bd-1623-9461-a9ad4da28cb3/mzl.rcvccmgy.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/52/99/22/5299222a-7dac-0041-7bca-5ff20ffb9bac/mzl.wsyuetqp.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/50/e9/b1/50e9b116-fb95-3d0c-39b3-055500f44880/mzl.ujzfoque.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/38/83/4d/38834d3f-9596-a5d9-7df6-4628feeaa109/mzl.kzorvvop.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/81/c9/b6/81c9b641-ba2e-e80f-aa6c-e8dfe2961991/mzl.eogbkelo.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/7b/bd/8a/7bbd8a01-2268-5c58-f426-7b3d85dd3a77/mzl.qumgitoi.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/ac/89/fa/ac89fa2f-5c91-544a-be33-5b11c68872e8/mzl.trjzonin.png/576x768bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you‚Äôre going to San Francisco we‚Äôll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).

This is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you‚Äôve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at¬†http://skiplagged.com/faq

I will review it again once my son takes his flight. | Useless | If you can travel light & not check bags, this is a legitimate service that Skiplagged provides that will routinely save you money, especially if you‚Äôre willing to #1 travel light, #2 book a couple weeks in advance, #3 not be the type of person that has change your flight multiple times before you actually go. | The unexpected charges upon arrival at the hotel we booked were ridiculous and were not made known to us before arrival. We were told we should‚Äôve booked directly through the hotel instead of a third party (Skiplagged), and we would‚Äôve been made aware of the additional charges. Why allow booking through third parties to begin with if that‚Äôs the case? Why would Skiplag not inform customers? | I have found myself using Skiplagged for years now and saving thousands of dollars on flights. I love that you can find the best deals with the best airlines. I highly recommend to anyone who travels on a budget. | I was in Bratislava, Slovakia and skipedlag got me home to jfk on short notice for 600usd. This is definitely the travelers app to consult | So easy to navigate the site for the best days to book flight for the best rates! | Why was i charged $10 after. | Is this app intended for traveling mice?  Why are the origin and Destination on the top of the search SO FREAKING SMALL??? | This site keeps me on top. | Been using it for years and have had no regrets- even wasting travel credits towards a free flight. | I was given a $10 and was not allowed to use it and was no option to add it at checkout. What‚Äôs up with the false advertising? | It‚Äôs my first time using this App, hope everything will be fine. Many thanks for creators. | I‚Äôm excited to have booked a flight for my nieces 9th birthday, with nonstop to and from; i have anxiety and couldn‚Äôt fathom a layover flight but my brother in law sent me this link and now I'm ready to pack; thanks Skiplagged. | You have a great prices at the right time | I would like this app to give me the option to filter-out flights on certain airplanes. I do not have confidence in Boeing, so it is important to me to be able to easily filter-out Boeing flights. | Skiplagged has saved me at least $1000 in the span of one year. Absolutely changed my life. It‚Äôs a Swiss Army knife for digital nomads. | This App is good for window shopping specifically to see the graphs for pricing. Never make a mistake of purchasing through this App. I booked for SJC to DFW, the ticket after the purchase is for SJC to LGA with a stop over in DFW. When reached out to then they said it‚Äôs called hidden city booking and I should have seen that in the terms or whatever. The problem is I can‚Äôt check in bags because of wrong destination and can‚Äôt cancel the ticket either as there is no refund. | Love frontier thanks for letting me book everytime | Skiplagged is epic for flight and hotel specials. I want take some time to say thank you to the creators of this app and bless you for your works. I saved lots time with this app | This is the best App I have ever used. Thank you! | Best travel site ever! Thank you | As a frequent flyer I am always looking for the best flights. Skiplagged is always the first app I open when booking flights. Such an easy to use app and very great valued ticket prices. I would recommend Skiplagged to anyone flying. | Was charged 9.99 without explanation!!!!! What is this charge for? | WHY BUY PROTECTION ON A FLIGHT IF YOU NEVER REFUND THE MONEY! | The cost of flights have increased since the pandemic.  Skiplagged offers great deals at great prices! | Very grateful to have this booking service!
Many options & great pricing! | The only app I use for booking | This used to be one of my favorite apps, but the latest update isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbug fixes and enhancements‚Äù; it‚Äôs forcing users to permit additional data collection and tracking. There is no option to opt out of this.  There is only the option to press ‚Äúcontinue.‚Äù  I do not want additional tracking, even if they claim they won‚Äôt sell my data.   I have serious concerns about privacy as well as price manipulation (a strategy used by some airline websites, using cookies and similar tools to show higher fares to users who have previously searched for that flight).   Even if Skiplagged isn‚Äôt doing this, I find the forced additional tracking to be extremely disrespectful to users who value privacy and autonomy.   I regret updating the app and wish I could revert to the old version. | Skiplagged charged MORE then the actual cost of the flight. This is not counting the service fee or additional protections I purchased which I am already being refunded for. Now, the issue.

The price of my flight alone and the flight cost listed by the airline have an $86.04 dollar difference. I am currently in talks with them to see where the extra money went on their end. It was canceled same day so I am supposed to get a full refund. Depending on how the issue is resolved, I will update my review. But why is there a difference in the first place? | It‚Äôs not always the cheapest, but most of the time & usually I can find a great deal, even on last minute flights. | So janky. The user interface is embarrassingly elementary. Don‚Äôt give them your info, it‚Äôll be compromised! | Excellent !!! | Great way to get away last minute | Do not book with this app unless you will be put on the no fly list for fraud unfortunately they don‚Äôt tell you this!! | Love this app | Thank you for such a great platform to conveniently get a to. Of information and ways how to save you a ton of money on the same trip.
I truly appreciate you exist. Thank you founders and app developers for such a brilliant idea and great execution. Brilliant work. | Using skiplagged makes so much sense. At your fingertips. Dependable | I love the options and savings available on this app. Salute. | Didn‚Äôt know there was a $20 charge and you took it w/o the okay 1st | Great app to save money on flights | The First time I booked with Skiplagged was a great experience, the app just made me feel comfortable during all the process.. so I didn't leave any review before because it was just a first experience so today I am just repeating with them, and when you repeat something that means it s great and that you like something.. Thanks Skiplagged in making a easy going experience, I will definitely be repeating | This app is very helpful.  It‚Äôs so easy to navigate.";4.82592;297992;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/75/b3/da/75b3daef-4b73-9667-ff89-4edc9e112082/b7e16b25-036c-4c99-a7fb-cdcd289f82f9_0_APP_IPHONE_55_0.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/27/16/64/271664e0-819e-5205-2b3c-2b860f34e0ec/1a373e20-a4ed-48dc-844e-76bdbad03730_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/c7/b6/d4/c7b6d498-c194-f98e-0199-a3020a5332ee/b00b4293-3660-416e-b09b-00fb781b5d0c_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/cb/10/07/cb1007db-9389-08ca-46a9-2121b42a0bb0/7b2902a7-256c-4727-b42f-9a3b799c13eb_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bf/b8/d5/bfb8d5fa-14de-15bb-9c27-33ca7a70750f/33b98f44-56cf-4aa1-91c1-7df7f0eb58e3_4_APP_IPHONE_55_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c2/55/0d/c2550ded-dab4-9d63-4bec-03d0f3af84b9/3a1e060d-c6cb-4a4d-aa64-33032ea27a81_5_APP_IPHONE_55_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/58/85/a0/5885a0a2-2318-2418-fdbc-a75f2793cf92/98c3f2ae-c721-4af8-a771-69e9dd700eb1_6_APP_IPHONE_55_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/5c/3c/f4/5c3cf492-7456-b8d3-be64-28e9be159077/7afb1c57-14e2-4cc8-9997-df2633530dc0_7_APP_IPHONE_55_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/11/31/61/113161f8-93d1-04d6-1e5c-abcec0858b59/a90253d9-511a-4824-a8ca-b1dca56a6f29_8_APP_IPHONE_55_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/56/fc/07/56fc07e3-bd10-ecdb-0e0b-30b6b8451b98/b2c7d192-3960-470b-994c-989344cc6b6a_0_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_0.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/d1/a5/87/d1a5874b-3c62-eb53-5a2f-4c0130ada5bf/8a9b6980-aeff-42eb-a638-28aa859573a0_1_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_1.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/7a/f2/e7/7af2e7a4-57f5-fe93-9a96-6395d5e3e570/43ecd6a7-6224-4fe7-9b8c-4da834b9daf2_2_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_2.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1a/67/2b/1a672bd0-3da8-79f4-7cde-bc30196061fc/6e18b6b0-1f15-4ecc-8a92-542125c146e1_3_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_3.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/25/02/73/250273ca-72e9-4986-72b6-26943129dc6c/0e00b059-c52e-4341-81ca-34b410dbaac3_4_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_4.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/66/1c/6d/661c6d96-9d0a-dfc8-1591-81693dfa5a90/2737307d-de89-41b2-881d-46248d365108_5_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_5.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9f/10/8e/9f108e00-2f1a-abef-1a27-e9557c38331a/943f85fc-11ed-4b3b-9ce4-67f3d9cbf747_6_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_6.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/28/83/c9/2883c929-64cf-4373-988a-aac9b4328558/3c6ef570-a33b-4336-bd35-b7842a33eed1_7_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_7.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEigh

Our app‚Äôs on track for some minor bug fixes and improvements this update.

We‚Äôve patched a few things that were slowing our app down.";"315";0;"USD";true;334235184;"thetrainline";"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/thetrainline/id334235184?uo=4";"https://www.thetrainline.com";4.90907;"First of all, the best value it provides is the convenience to buy tickets in the palm and seamless integration of payment with Apple Pay, and maybe discount tickets sometimes.

But, it has a few serious UX issues need to be addressed. 
1) unable to save companion passengers info. It becomes annoying that every search you have to reenter them.
2) it somehow saves the dates and stations of the last search, and if you are not being careful, you can end up buying the wrong tickets. It happened to us that we end up buying tickets at the spot in the train station, but the tickets are for two days later. Luckily the ticket inspector on the train gave us a break, and we just let the wrong tickets expire.
3) on the return trip, it tries to charge about 9 euros booking fee, so we went to the ticket office, and was able to save 30 euros. The train is about to start in 20 minutes, so ticket agent may be offering a discount, but this is not reflected on Trainline app.
Anyways, I will not use this app anymore for spontaneous tickets. But it could be useful for planned travel when not in a hurry. | Do not use it, the tickets I bought were invalid. And they do not provide refund. | If you the app be careful. I bought my train tickets and in the worse moment in the middle of the trip block my user name. The result: lost of my tickets. Try to get in contact and no answer. So again be careful. | I use OrarioTreni to check and control the time and status of trains in Italy. It has been bought by train line yet TRAINLINE doesn‚Äôt give me the features of OrarioTreni. And on iPhone 15, for some reason I am unable to close the prompt to transfer to TRAINLINE. I‚Äôm so annoyed that the one app I used daily (ORARIOTRENI) is no unavailable to me. 

And train line is not a substitute for me. I‚Äôm sitting on a train now, wanting the live status of my train. It doesn‚Äôt help me‚Ä¶.. | Unlike national rail apps, Trainline prefers to suggest intercity routes rather than big brands like TGV or EuroStar, which makes it exceptionally easy to bypass problems on the track. It‚Äôs helped me many times to bypass cancellations or construction by approaching the city from a different direction. The best part: the route is provided already, and all the tickets can be bought in just one click.

The downside is that this preference for intercity trains with lots of transfers isn‚Äôt ideal if you‚Äôre trying to save time, if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with navigating train stations, or if your train is delayed. If you need direct routes, they can be found on Trainline, but you have to search carefully. | This app is very easy and intuitive‚Ä¶ until you actually have to use it. Do not use this app‚Äî especially if you are traveling in a foreign country!!! It will screw you sideways and make you think it‚Äôs your fault, or that you are crazy. I absolutely never write reviews for anything, but I want to save someone else the trouble. DO NOT USE TRAINLINE TO TRAVEL!!!! | They will not refund money when their app and systems fail. Emails go to spam, app doesn‚Äôt load ticket. It‚Äôs all on the customer. Shame on this company | I downloaded this app and tried to buy a ticket but once I had entered my credit card information I was oddly invited to join a movie service. This I declined, but then was contacted by my credit card company about a fraudulent transaction. I had just been charged 5 pounds by the movie service!!! I was unable to buy the train ticket. This is a shocking experience that they need to fix asap! | Trainline does an exceptionally poor job communicating that when taking trains from EU to UK you need to arrive early and go straight to customs. Because of this I missed my train, along with 20 other people. The station had many attendants ready to handle this, because 20 people miss every train because of this poor messaging. I thus missed my connecting train in London and had to buy a new ticket at 600% the price. Trainline customer support was no help. In fact their phone number just went straight to voice mail regardless of how many times I called, forcing me to use their text chat. | This app worked the first time used it but now I cannot log in or change my password. All that appears is a blank screen after brief flicker. If I try to create a new account, it says that my email already exists. Online chat was of no help. | The app threw in random other stops into my search results so I accidentally booked the  wrong destination station. Could not exchange my or ticket or change it even though I called within minutes of booking it. Ended up wasting 40 euros for a bad and confusing interface and a company that won‚Äôt honor its own exchange  policy. Absolutely terrible and unacceptable. | This made getting around the UK really Easy! | App won‚Äôt let me type in my destination, so I can‚Äôt buy a ticket. Also, no English options, which isn‚Äôt great. | When rescheduling a train trip that only costs $2 more than the original ticket they charge a fee that‚Äôs 60% of the cost of the previous ticket. Price gouging at a level I only see with Ticketmaster. Very predatory business practice. | App functionality is good.  The app does not always assign a seat and that causes near disruption to travel.  No seat is no seat.  Either stand or take another train. | Seriously if there was a points scheme for this app I would be platinum elite. I use this app so much and it‚Äôs so easy to use!!! Also, if you need to change, or refund, it‚Äôs EAAAASY. it‚Äôs my go to train app and it never fails. | I used this company to purchase tickets from Italy to go to Germany and to return. the Italian train was canceled and this company said you can‚Äôt get a refund from us because the trains you had to reschedule in Germany had nothing to do with the trains that I purchased in Italy.
so if you have to reschedule tickets because of one company but they‚Äôre booking everything separately for you, you will be screwed. 
and then they refuse to even give you a refund for their service fees, it‚Äôs ridiculous.

 It says you can easily reschedule and Manage the tickets to their app but you cannot. when you go to click on manage or reschedule it says that you have to call their customer service, the number doesn‚Äôt work, or you have to email them. by that point your travel plans have already been disrupted you will be forced to purchase additional tickets and you won‚Äôt be able to wait for their customer service team to respond to reschedule your tickets.

 This is just ridiculous. Do not ever use this app and I will never be using this app again I‚Äôm gonna use it to find out where the tickets and the trains are but I will never purchase through them again. | Do not download another train app. This app covers Europe with a user interface that is about as good as Uber. | Bestü´°üíö | I used this for multiple tickets in Italy. It was supposed to be 80% refundable but when I tried to change tickets, it said I would receive $0. Do not use it. | If you have any issues with delays or cancellations - good luck. Customer support is useless and they will simply say they are a third party provider and can‚Äôt help you. | Do not trust the bookings. And then no customer service. Lack of ability to make changes even after train delays. Does not link to real train times. This is not good and I do NOT recommend this app to anyone. They are crooks. Book your tickets directly. | We purchased multiple tickets through their system. Some tickets came through email as an attachment for iwallet which worked GREAT. Other tickets came through as a link to the app. These (1) had different train times in the header than for the body of the ticket and (2) didn't always show up on the app but as a download to print or just not at all. 

There seems to be no rhyme or reason to this system. It‚Äôs confusing, inaccurate, and just an all-around frustration for my wife and I.  Zero stars. | Used on a trip thru Europe. Useful for searching the train schedules. Buying tickets thru them is a bad idea. App sometimes changes the stations you are searching (for no apparent reason). Once you purchase, you are out of luck- nice gentlemen at customer service empathized with me because ‚Äòno one likes to lose their money‚Äô but the ticket policies are up to the train and Trainline can do nothing even if the tickets were purchased a few seconds ago.  At least the app could prompt ‚Äòyou are buying tickets to leave in one hour from a station 1000 km from your current location. Are you sure?‚Äô
Wrote off those tickets and bought at the station- cheaper base fare, no ‚Äòservice‚Äô fee, and the machine defaulted to start the trip at the station where I was. Don‚Äôt see any reason to pay extra to buy via the app | Have fun booking a ticket when the price increase out from under you several times in a row. The app doesn't hold the fare during checkout. | Bought a OUIGO train ticket from Paris to Marseille. We arrived on time and expected to have a seat. We went looking for our seat and there‚Äôs no Carriage 18 on this train. It looks like we got the correct train to Marseille which left the station at the exact time we were supposed to be leaving. The train only has 10 carriages and yet our ticket says Carriage 18. There‚Äôs a carriage 8 with our seat number but he showed us a ticket for theirs. So we are now stuck here on this train to Marseille for 3+ hours without a seat at this super hot carriage. Never again!! | Train ticket I got has no seat number, no carriage number, no class of service, etc. All of that info needs to be clearly on the ticket and it‚Äôs not. I had to dig through my e-mail to find that info. | Trainline is not affiliated with any UK rail organisation, and as such, can charge whatever they like with ridiculous terms & conditions. Booking with Trainline means you can pay 2x normal rate, can‚Äôt change your booking and might not have the most up to date schedule. STAY AWAY | Have not used this terrible app since before 2020 and all credit cards have now expired.  Seeking to reserve  train tickets now but never purchased any.  Then magically nonrefundable tickets with incorrect date appear as purchases; no idea why.
Most outrageous flaw is that Apple Pay now appears as valid form of payment though I never added it and obviously it did not exist when i last used this app.
I strongly advise against launching this app until developer corrects these serious bugs.
IMO Trainline is dishonest and unethical. | The app works very well for booking train travel, but I attempted to cancel to pre-booked train tickets that were ‚Äúrefundable‚Äù,  the app malfunctioned in both cases and would not allow me to cancel travel. It referred me to a bad number for customer service, leaving me only email. Since email is only checked every 24 hours, they didn‚Äôt honor the requested cancellation. 

The Trainline contact information does not appear on the website, and the referral number provided by the app was incorrect. As a result, I did not get my refund. when I eventually reached the call center after endless emails, they were of absolutely no help.

If I could give zero stars, I would. | I can use the sign on with Apple just fine on the website but it won‚Äôt log on in the app‚Ä¶. | Tried to book tickets for Europe trip. Unfortunately, an immature app, poor infrastructure, and horrendous customer service resulted in a substantial waste of time and money. ‚ÄúWe are just the reseller‚Äù is what they say to deflect responsibility; actually their business is just reselling, so they should try to do it well. Not the case. | Used this app for my trip to Austria. 
1. It doesn‚Äôt give you all the possible routes. I found faster and better routes by manually playing with the different stations. 
2. When looking to by a ticket routes kept disappearing 
3. When trying to buy a ticket for my son I kept getting a generic error and was about to be late for the train. 
4. Booked a ride which turned out to switch to a bus and that had no indication in the app. 

Would recommend using the trains app which is much better. | I actually forgot my wallet at home in the US and all I had with me for a 6N trip thru London and the UK was my Applewallet. Being able to download the app and buy train tickets right on my phone totally saved me! App was easy to use, schedules were clear‚Äîeven for a visitor! | I have used trainline to make plans for my upcoming trip and it has been a real tragedy 

To start with, The Trainline App runs fast and stable on iPhone BUT they‚Äôd search results shows different price every 10 minutes. It creates an sense of urgency and push you to book .

Second, their prices are 30-100% higher than what I found on the train company website , it is unbelievable how much markup they add. 

Finally, their refund policy is MISLEADING and even deceiving and I have big regrets to put my faith in it. No matter what you choose , economy , premium , smart plus , you name it, they WON‚ÄôT let you claim a refund . It is always ‚Äú non-refundable ‚Äú ,  what I saw at the booking page is refundable , yet at the end , they won‚Äôt give a penny back . I read the policy back and forth with attention, spending my time to choose the best option , yet , I don‚Äôt have the option to change or refund when my travel plan updates , they either show you options of a double price ticket or non refundable.

I sincerely regret it and would warn anyone who wants to use trainline app: it is a rip-off | I‚Äôve used a few websites and booked trains all over Europe. This app is utterly useless to me. It literally does nothing other than give an error message with no further direction or help. Wasted my time. | I don‚Äôt travel that often by train, but when I do I use this app to get tickets. Easy to use timetable to see options, I use Apple Pay and digital tickets, no problems. | Will not process my Amex !!..tried 2 different cards and wouldn‚Äôt take them!!!said could verify information supplied‚Ä¶triple checked correct and still wouldn‚Äôt take it!!! | This app is great, especially if you‚Äôre traveling in UK! | Full stop. | I get an error every time I try to checkout. So annoying, I picked out my train and entered all of my info. I wish it told me at the getting that it wasn‚Äôt going to work | Very easy to navigate and plan.  Actually getting payment to work is impossible.  Tried 4 different ways.  Gave up.  Take care of your customers or someone else will.  ‚úåÔ∏è | I‚Äôve travelled within countries as well as cross-border between Germany, Belgium, UK, and Austria and this worked beautifully everywhere. I love that I can use ApplePay within the app to buy e-tickets including Eurostar and they worked in all the countries where etickets are accepted (UK often requires paper) but between countries as well as within each country without having to look for a ticket kiosk. I only wish it showed which platform the train was departing from but still a must-have app. | A recent trip to Spain gave us the opportunity to use this App. It is an excellent App. Simple, easy to use. 100% reliable. Much‚Ä¶MUCH better than the Amtrak App in the US. | Excellent app for taking trains in Europe. Some features could be a bit more refined, like consistently including carriage and seat numbers on train tickets (for DB trains they are in the confirmation email only) it live platform updates, but all around a must for train travel in Europe (EU + UK) | When I purchased a train ticket, the number on the ticket provide by the app did not match the actual train number that I was to take. Therefore I missed the train. Because it was the last train of the night I had to stay overnight in a hotel. The cost of a taxi to/from the station, hotel and new ticket was significant. 

I emailed the company yet never received a response. 

In conclusion, this app is not accurate. It‚Äôs not reliable. It‚Äôs not responsive and could end up costing you a lot of money. | Wonderful experience | Tried to book tickets but got message

10:14
Well, this is awkward
Sorry! There was a problem at our end of the line. Please try again.
OK

Rebooted several times, reinstalled app both to no avail. Thank goodness for old fashioned telephone call. Presumably works ok on laptop, but that‚Äôs not what I want, nor what worked perfectly well previously. Did inform Trainline so probably will be rectified soon. | The promise made in the app is that you have several hours to cancel for a refund after booking. However, cancellation is technically impossible while the ticket is in a status of ‚Äòcreating‚Äô, which mine was for several hours after my purchase. I needed to cancel and I was unable to do so before the cancellation window expired.

I tried to reach out directly for support but there was no chat or call option easily available. If you are going to use buggy software with your business you need a reachable support team. Very disappointed. | Ridgeland tried to use SNCF and It was a nightmare full of errors and bugs The user Experience is great on Trainline. It also allows you to use vouchers and discount cards that you have even if you bought them somewhere else. It‚Äôs also super nice to be able to reserve certain seats in advance without having to purchase

Less hassle. Southwest makes it easy to use their app. | Simple check in from home. We will see when I get to the airport tomorrow. üòä | Flight delays are ridiculous and no assigned seats is a bad idea! My first time on southwest, I mostly fly delta. Probably my last! | Quick and to the point app. Thanks for making it easy without too much extra! | On-line check-in  so easy! | Paid for early bird but still got boarding  group B. | Is not working. I pull it up and I get a picture of a field of flowers and no controls or anything. | Great service no turbulance | We paid extra for early bird check in and our boarding pass does not acknowledge that. What????? | Don‚Äôt update boarding times and flight times with delays | Southwest has always been really good to us, thanks for the great experiences. | I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Southwest! ‚ô•Ô∏è | Hi love SWA very easy to fly! | From beginning to end easy | I want to put my flight on the Home Screen this app is unorganized | We paid for early bird check in and it was t honored | Flight before last was delayed for 14 hours. A ninety minute flight had me arriving over 7 hours after I would have arrived if driving.  

Yesterday my direct flight home was cancelled and I was rebooked on a flight that was not schedule to depart for two additional days.  

This is stressful and I am going back to Delta.  The price savings with Southwest is no longer a savings. | We fly out tomorrow so review will come later | Please make it available to upgrade second segment at time of check in for first flight | Love flying this airline - always service with a smile! | Works flawlessly. You can change your flights easily. Never have to talk with a representative, app is fully functional. No complaints | Terrible.  This happens all the time.  I‚Äôm done with Southwest | Can‚Äôt get important notifications without also getting spammed DAILY with spam. Fick of. | Only left 4 stars as each time this app updates, it logs us out. Please stop that. Others can update without this annoying side effect, please do the same | Always very nice to fly with Southwest. | I was in the middle of booking my flight and got a notification that the price
Went up $10. That doesn‚Äôt seem fair when I was almost done with my booking. | Totally helpful on the phone fixing a missing trusted traveler number and getting my reservation fixed up before a stressful trip to a funeral.  Many thanks to southwest. | I know the airline is going through some hard times. But I will never fly any other airlines. You have been there for us with no bag fees and affordable flights. We are with you through the hard times. Thank you | I checked in at exactly 24 hours before the flight but I am still at the end of B group. | Southwest flight crews are like family, they take me to the best places ‚ù§Ô∏è | SW-Air is the best bang for the buck hands down. Keep up the good work!
Cheers 
GDY | I‚Äôve been removed from my flight from Burbank to Portland TWICE now and rebooked on other flights that are not convenient to me or the people I‚Äôve arranged rides with, to and from the airport. This, after a huge fiasco flying SW during the last holiday! Do better | I hate that the widget decides when it wants to work. Sometimes it‚Äôll work other times you can‚Äôt even find it & have to go into the app to your flight. | So happy with Southwest!  I always recommend this airline. Staff is friendly and courteous and check in is easy. So far, I‚Äôve had nothing but a great experience flying with them. | Southwest is the most convenient and customer friendly  airline to fly. | When I consider all the angles of the service it deserves a good review.  There is always room for improvement and I hope they can find a good replacement for their boarding process. | I just wanted to say that I love flying Southwest. My husband and I loved travelling interisland pre pandemic! We haven‚Äôt done much travelling together but I get to travel for my job now! 
  So, I absolutely love the customer service that I was provided in regards to flying out for my job.
 My Rapid Rewards account was still under my maiden name and I had just changed my ID over to my married name. I had called Southwest to switch my name to my married name. I was told to just submit a picture of my ID and marriage license to their email. They sent me a confirmation that my incident was reported and I should receive a reply within 30days. I got a email saying it all got switched over in a little over 1 week. Now every time I fly for work I can just check in early on the Southwest app!
Thank you Southwest you are so awesome! | So user fruendly!!!!! | The app is very slow to load. | I paid for early booking and got the end of A group on first half of flight and on second half my son and I are divided between A and B group. | It is was efficient, fast and great
Thank you | I had an issue trying to book a flight., so I called and spoke to a rep named Stacy. 
She was absolutely spectacular! Was extemely helpful in booking our flight.
She was well versed in her a job and very professional. 
Thank you Southwest for having such great associates.
Thank you Stacy for all your help!
Leo Lambert | I have to sign in every time and app moves slow. So frustrating when trying to check in | Awesome Airlines! Y‚Äôall rock. Elias Garcia | The big snow storm coming to CO caused us to change my daughter‚Äôs flight home for spring break. Due to the limited last minute flights, we had to change cities too. There was a significant increase in the fare, but Vinita was able to take care of me. Thank you Vinita!! You‚Äôre the BEST!! We ‚ù§Ô∏è you, and we ‚ù§Ô∏è Southwest! | I don‚Äôt travel much, but when I do Southwest has my back! | This airline is just such a great airline to fly with the employees are outstanding, always helpful funny kind. | Great staff with commitment to fun and accommodation: pick the seat you like based on your own desire and effort, not just wealth: makes for a funner travel group!

Ability to find community through recommendations and get a real time look in at what people are doing across the world. | Explain for the life of me why Philadelphia is not listed. I see South Philadelphia and Philadelphia county and someplace called new Philadelphia. I don‚Äôt see Center City Philadelphia or just simply Philadelphia in general I don‚Äôt understand. | This app has a great concept for planning trips, however is very slow when searching destinations to add. | Very glitchy - takes a long time to load. Shows all results of things to do, after you put in the location, to places in completely different countries!! | The map feature only shows you the most recent 10 recommendations. To see them all I have to scroll and load each recommendation which takes FOREVER. And when I click into any recommendation, I lose my place and have to start over. So it‚Äôs virtually impossible for me to actually see all my recommendations laid out. So disappointing, I‚Äôll have to just use google maps | Before you begin there is a short questionnaire which asks who you are traveling with. I put family and children, yet when I inserted my travel destination and had an itinerary generated, it recommended things that were not kid friendly.

Additionally, the questionnaire asks what your budget looks like. Although I chose the lowest bracket, it recommended five star restaurants that were completely unaffordable for me. 

There were a couple hidden gems in the recommendations, but overall it isn‚Äôt worth the space it would take up on my phone unless some more moms joined the community to beef up the kid and budget friendly recommendations. | Looking for a great planning tool that allows you to share with others in your group. This is the one, nice layout and many recommendations for your area of stay. | I could not for the life of me figure out how to see any reviews for places in a city. Whoever designed the ui for this app should be fired. | I want to live this app but it‚Äôs certainly glitching on me. I‚Äôm clicking on what I know is a restaurant I have saved in San Fran and it‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs a beach. | Great to find people who like what you like, so you can get a better idea of what you may like in new places.

I‚Äôve added a bunch, and the location are off. For example, upstate NY is occasionally included in NYC and 2 of my Japanese restaurants in NYC are being listed as a cathedral location. | I love the concept of the app, but some features don‚Äôt work or don‚Äôt have a real purpose. It‚Äôs really hard to just search an area without looking at someone else‚Äôs list. When you search something and add it to a list, the UI just throws you back to a random place and you have to start your search over again. Needs some work on user experience, but I‚Äôll keep using and hope bugs get fixed! | People use Apple Maps for the same use as an app like this. This is just a places finder. So no point and not recommended. | So excited to use this app! Look me up and share your travel tips! @bohemianspirit | I love this app‚Äîso helpful for planning trips! If I have one suggestions, it‚Äôs that I wish you could add comments/reminders to yourself when you add a place to a trip (e.g., what dish everyone loves at a restaurant). I think you can‚Äôt add notes like that when you‚Äôre planning, only once you‚Äôve marked it as a recommendation. | I use OOO both for finding new restaurants and as a quasi-travel diary so when I go back to a city I can remember my own favorites! 

With fake reviews / AI seeming to be on the rise on other sites, it‚Äôs fantastic that OOO allows you to filter by reviews of people you know. | I love this app, but I think it‚Äôs going to take some updates and improvement before this app becomes trendy. Users should be able to categorize places manually because some of them are incorrect‚Äîe.g., it lists one of my hotels as something to ‚Äúdo‚Äù instead of as a place to stay‚Äîand there is no way to change it. I also saved a recommendation in Utah and it is showing up as a location in Michigan. But I would love to see this app grow and for more people to start using it, it has such awesome potential!! | You‚Äôre only able to make itineraries with limited items. I work really hard to find hidden gems so it doesn‚Äôt really make sense that I can make an itinerary using only the most popular spots | The best way to make the perfect itinerary for all your stops & trips üòç | Love all the features so far, but how can I make a reservation as I don‚Äôt see how you do it using open table. Is a booking feature coming soon? | Not only is the brand name perfect. I love how the app is designed and it‚Äôs features. I can definitely see this app being a must have for travellers with a few extra features. 
I use it to plan my trips and save my must go to places. It‚Äôs been super handy! 

I would love to see a option on the trips section to share the itinerary via PDF. I can imagine it would look perfect to share with friends who don‚Äôt use the app or if you are planning a trip for a family member. 

Keep up the great work! I‚Äôm a super fan! Finally an app that not only is pretty but also super useful ü´∂üèº | I love this app. Just starting to use it and I am in love with the My trips part of it. Love being able to add places of interest with times for each day! The only thing is that some of the places I rec show incorrect info on my page. I recommended a place in Utah Wyoming and the final place on my place is showing Ann Arbor, MI. Another is showing incorrect town with a picture that had nothing to do with my review.  Also the feedback does not work on the app. Unable to send any feedback. | EDITS:
Would also love to see the ability to add a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù item- for example: hop-on, hop-off bus tours. Would be super helpful to leave a review and just save my pictures and notes from the experience for keepsakes.

This could easily be the next big social media craze, especially with travel coming back! I love the concept: plan and document all my trips in one place, with ability to recap them in the perfect mix of photos and written descriptions, WITH A SCHEDULE :) so I can easily pass down detailed plans. Amazing. BUT, there are definitely features missing before it can go viral‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd love to see: - The ability to add photos to a place just for you/even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúrec‚Äù a place, so I don‚Äôt have to post personal pictures to the internet if I want to use it like a social network with a cute recap of me and my partner on a trips‚Äô pictures for our friends and family. This would go along great with better privacy/sharing settings, so I can share my trips and photos and comments/notes with people, allow others to add comments who are tripmates and maybe a ‚Äúview only‚Äù tier with public/private comments for what I want a friend to be able to see (if someone from work asks for trip recs, but maybe I don‚Äôt want them to see my reservation notes on a place but do want them to see my review). | As a travel agent, I LOVE using this app to build trips for my clients. Once all of your activities/hotels/restaurants are loaded, my clients are able to click on the itinerary and everything shows up on the map in their app, which saves them  TONS of time from having to Google everything individually outside the app. Super trendy, modern, and unique recs from all the users. Such a fun travel space to be in! | Amazing for travels recs and finding new places.  I‚Äôve been sending lists of my recs for years and now this makes it so much easier to share with friends! | I hope more people use it, such a cool idea | A really awesome function that should be incorporated in to this beautiful app would be a visually appealing countdown feature for ‚ÄúMy Trips‚Äù. A bonus would be the ability to create a Home Screen widget for your countdown as well! | So much potential. I got so excited for this app and to use it but has a few problems. This is my first ever review on here because guess what? Your feedback option does not work. You click on submit and does nothing. Do you guys not test your app after updates?
Also, does anybody who works for this app ever use it at all? If so, you can easily catch the glitches and what needs to be fixed. For example, when you click the ‚Äúback‚Äù button, it doesn‚Äôt really go back to the previous page you‚Äôre on. When i am checking out another person‚Äôs profile, clicks on their recs, and then tries to go to back to their page, it doesn‚Äôt. It leads me back to my profile! It is so annoying. Please fix this. The app is way too focused on ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù but has no quality. Way too many problems. | I love this ap!! I love having lists for all my trips in one place, love the aesthetic, & the map feature ! 

I would LOVE to be able to make my own notes for businesses that only I can see. That way any research I‚Äôve done on the place can be there too. For example- a place that doesn‚Äôt take reservations for breakfast, I‚Äôd like to note that :) | Love the look and design of this app, and the concept and information you get for trips is amazing!! Really helpful to create your own trip folders or wishlists all in one place with pictures, location etc etc. convenient and helpful to get you to all the places you‚Äôre wanting! 

The docked star is due to some interface annoyances through using the app. When clicking into someone‚Äôs recommendation from a trip and clicking the back arrow it brings you all the way back to the search page rather than that person‚Äôs trip to continue looking through their reccos. So you have to find your way back to where you were if you want to continue browsing. | Love this concept and the ease of use of the app. As a business owner, I wish there was a way we could edit information that isn‚Äôt correct, such as hours of operation. I understand the concept is for this to be different than Yelp, just wish we could provide accurate information. | This app is a beautiful way to plan trips and to remember past trips. | So helpful to see hometown recommendations! Love love love this app and can‚Äôt wait to see all the new features that get added üôåüèΩ | As someone who loves traveling and giving recs, this is perfect. Still needs some things worked out,   Like my profile picture and background photo do not load or show? probably a bug issue. Also I would love it if you were able to have a tab with a grid of all the photos you‚Äôve took at locations, similar to Instagram, and the ability to change the main photo on your profile of trip locations. Otherwise great app can would love to see this grow | While I‚Äôm pretty proud of the state of my travel spreadsheets, this app blows them away. The social aspect, easily saving and sharing ideas with friends, make planning so much easier. | Pros:
+ GPS enabled search
+ Clean, intuitive functions
+ Collaborative space

Cons:
- does not map from location to location
- there‚Äôs no default view of a trip to show the entire itinerary, you have you click day by day 
- you can‚Äôt share trips to Instagram stories, there should be an attractive easy display for sharing on social media 
- there is no FAQ or feedback section in the app to suggest changes 
- you cannot make notes about a location or place you select for your trip, therefore I still prefer using notes over this app until it adds features

I am happy to use this app for an upcoming trip and will provide an updated review if the app features are updated. | I love this concept! The app is super easy to navigate and fun to use. I love logging all of the places I‚Äôve been to, because it both helps give people I know recommendations, and it gives me a nice memory bank of where I‚Äôve been. I used this to plan a recent trip, and it was such a neat way to keep track of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do. Love the map feature to see where in a city my friend‚Äôs recommendations are, and to find where my next stop is on vacation! | Love all the features so far. Genius idea!! When I‚Äôm planning trips, especially international trips, I use google maps to organize the itinerary based on location and proximity. I‚Äôm def gonna start inviting friends to join to make our lives easier. 
 For more effective itinerary planning, I would suggest adding the following:
1. Times
2. Option to add attachments, videos or images because some of the images don‚Äôt do these places justice)
3. Finally notes within scheduled places (as shown in the previews) and also notes to add activities that are not listed. 

I also love how the map shows the proximity of places to each other but is it possible to add a feature where we can see the actual distance from one place to another and perhaps driving directions? Currently, google maps only opens for directions to one place. | truly changes the game | Really great concept and I love the user friendliness. However, each time I try to see a list of someone‚Äôs recs on their page (or even my own), the recs do not load. The only way I can see recs is by searching a city right now. Needs an update probably

UPDATE: it works fine. This ^ was only happening for a few hours the first day. Really cool app! | Great for planning trips and sharing recommendations with friends! | It‚Äôs so awesome that you can put locations on the day you plan to visit but why not add time? It‚Äôs not a full function collaboration or trip planing tool if you can‚Äôt plan times in your day. | Cool app. Will definitely be using in future travels. Just wish there was an option to add your own photos and notes. Could possibly make this option private or public for others to see. | There are many things I love about this app. I just started using ‚Äúplan my trip‚Äù.  
Not only am I adding all the places/ things I want to do as I prepare but this will also serve as a record for me for future,  Have u ever tried to remember that little restaurant you had stumbled across but couldn‚Äôt. Just park it here. | Love the app, such a great concept, very user friendly, and very great aesthetically. Just one thing- please make an update where you can make folders within each city of recommendations so that we can distinguish between food recs/activities/shopping, etc. Right now they are all in one category under each city and I‚Äôm afraid my recommendations will get lost in the sauce and get confusing if I keep adding to it! Would love a bit of organization and categories within each city. Thank you! | I‚Äôm already obsessed with the app as-is. It‚Äôs been. A very practical, helpful tool for trip research & planning - especially for group trips with friends or family. I don‚Äôt have a ton of friends on the app yet, so my planning process is still to go to Pinterest or travel blogs for ideas and then I save my wishlist things to do in Out of Office. If they keep building out additional features that make it more useful, building a user base I want to follow, and create more opportunities for engagement across users, this app will be an absolutely must have for anyone who enjoys a trip! | I love to see what friends and influencers that I follow are doing when they travel. Places to stay, eat, sights to see! I sometimes DM people and ask but this makes it so much easier especially when planning a trip and giving others recommendations. 10/10 recommend! | This is hands down one of the most beneficial travel apps I have ever used. For someone who loves to travel the reviews and recommendations have been spot on! Can‚Äôt wait to use the app on my next trip! | A user friendly interface that‚Äôs so easy to use! And because I trust my friends (and some influencers), it makes picking my hotel or restaurant so simple! Why didn‚Äôt someone think of this sooner? (Love the name, btw) | The reviews and recommendations have been great - love being able to follow friends (and their friends) and family and get their advice on where to eat, stay, and visit. Much , much better than the other travel info sources available where random people give input. Already using it for planning vacations and also for enjoying the city I live in - finding new places right in my own town I had never heard abou!!!";4.85358;3060;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a5/86/90/a5869022-b96d-2390-9ea5-e6488c9db741/1c23d18a-0122-40d0-b094-cf75e9771f8a_5.5_-_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/23/da/59/23da59fc-9dfa-f844-9f57-fa7bc0b94cf0/7cb626d7-8619-4f2d-a096-9131382302a0_5.5_-_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/80/cd/aa/80cdaaf6-61d9-9657-5185-6a2eb44d8744/8585b7a1-896d-4e06-a35d-0157f53054b9_5.5_-_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/7e/91/60/7e916084-f29b-3b48-9026-623f60f87163/688918db-fd62-4108-b57f-d610b75f06a6_5.5_-_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e5/ef/e1/e5efe100-0c1a-dacf-72e3-def3c8bee1b2/a854fc0f-3047-426f-8633-9dc12d2cc6f8_5.5_-_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/be/fd/68/befd682b-e9a8-c5f6-655c-9a9aef12ad64/3ae7c7ca-0557-4980-9828-aef144c5dfad_5.5_-_6.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Seriously! Ty ty!! | I have had to call 3 times because of my error. Each time my problem was resolved quickly. The customer representatives all have been knowledgeable and extremely helpful. | Very good customer service 
Easy website to navigate | Amazing App | I love the app as it‚Äôs very user friendly and informative. I was hesitant as I was unfamiliar and will use this more often and to plan trips . | Good job | Planning a multi-city trip in Europe and the app has been very easy to use! | So great and user friendly for our quick flights around the UK | Beware that you are only allowed 15kg for checked baggage. Overage is 6 Euros per kilo! Don‚Äôt assume that you are allowed more! | Excellent app, I always find the best price for my trips. | Sin dudar la mejor agencia para comprar mis boletos de viaje. | I liked | Excelente servicio | Do NOT use eDreams to buy your ticket!!! I have used it and they have charged me for a Prime fee without warning or agreement. I did got their automatic email, although I have never set up a password or used their prime services. They keep your card info after you buy a ticket and just take the money after a month. And yes, they charge a YEAR in advance. I have been trying to contact them for a refund and all I get is automatic responses. Do not make a mistake like I did! | Easy to you | The best app ever. | Solo estoy iniciando con una prueba | I just got off a customer support call with a eDreams representative in order to cancel my eDreamsPrime membership. But according to the person on the call I cannot cancel, because when I asked to do so he replied with asking if I had the eDreams application, then to use the application to set a reminder before the membership is renewed again. How is that a cancellation? And when I asked about a refund I was told by the same person that because the membership renewal activated already ( on 3/11/2024 and it was the same day I called.) I couldn‚Äôt receive a refund. The eDreams representative said the best they could offer was some monetary offer on their service. Don‚Äôt sign up for eDreams Prime if you want to save yourself from a headache from canceling it when you‚Äôre done with it. | I love booking with this airline! | I love eDreams! This booking site gave me the best deal for my last minute booking! Not even the airline itself could give me the flight itinerary nor the price that perfectly fit my need and budget. Keep up the good work, eDreams! Glad to have found you‚Ä¶And also thanks for offering me the Prime Plus membership to try for free. Together, this saved me almost 2/3 of my flight cost. Really gratefulüôèüèª | So far so good

airline confirmation numbers perfect. Hoping for the best | No good no good | Very easy to use | It was so easy and less money with more guarantee on Edreams! Thanks üòä | i've been using this app for the last two years and I find it is always cheaper than some of the other apps available for booking flights. It is also so easy to use. You can book a flight in minutes. | So far the app has been easy to use, and the prices have been fairly decent | I booked a multi city trip yesterday and decided to cancel it within the 24 hour period. Now I am fearful that eDreams will cancel and take all my money because I can not reach a real person. Are there any real people who work there? | Excelente | Love it | This December I‚Äôll use it to make side trip to Thailand from Manila and reservations for air travel is very simple and surprisingly affordable. I search my flights via Google however I only book the flight if it‚Äôs through eDreams because there is no extra fees and with some extra fees, your entire trip can be refunded which is definitely worth it. Top notch service | 1st time user, and I have no complaints. | Best out there | Sign in with apple only works on iphone, not web.

It doesn't work properly. | Esta app es una basura !!! desde el a√±o pasado intento eliminar mi suscripci√≥n y no se puede siempre  te envian un n√∫mero para llamar, pero no est√° disponible, son unos ladrones | The best experience ever | What a horrible experience my 3 children, my wife and I are having with this agency. I hope this doesn't end badly... If they resolve the inconvenience I'll change this review. Waiting resolve! | Than you absolutely have to get this app! It‚Äôs not a trick it just gives you deals that are hard to believe | Aside from taking hours to get to someone on the phone, and never getting to anyone through the webchat. I booked a flight is May 2023 that was cancelled by the airline and I still did not get my refund. Do not recommend!!!! | They took care of me . I just it was a sc site at -1st . It‚Äôs the real deal. Thx | Great discounts!! | Una excelente p√°gina para comprar vuelos y a c√≥modos precios !! Un 10 üòç | My experience with Edreams was terrible. I discovered that my name had been entered incorrectly on the flights ( if my name were Tom Jones, they entered it as Tom Tomjones)

   The confirmation email did not give any hint of this error, but when I approached travel time, I found it. Edreams refused to deal with the problem, only offering me an 80% refund if I canceled all the flights. They refused to cancel individual sections of flights, which were all on different airlines. Airlines usually refer you back to the travel agency, for problems   but in each case, the airlines relented after lengthy discussions, and made the necessary changes. I have not yet flown, so I‚Äôm not certain that the name changes have been successful. he insisted that the airlines were legally obligated to make the changes but I believe that is not the case.

   additionally, the wrong birthdates were entered on both my ticket and my daughters ticket.  I was also stuck with a $150 baggage fee that I had not requested but did not notice on my confirmation email.

   Wait times on phone calls were excessive and the apps did not give me any opportunities to deal with the issue without a representative.   

It or if it were possible to give a negative star review I would. In my many decades of life I have not encountered an equally difficult experience. | Really good to book your flight to every where and the service is 100% good | Paid extra money to be able to reschedule a flight. Destination was experiencing a high wind warning with expected power outages and recommendations to NOT travel due to 90mph gusts. Was not allowed to reschedule, and wasn‚Äôt even refunded the extra fee I paid to be able to. | Perfect timing | Prices seem to be much lower on Expedia. | I love this app and I recommend it to everyone | scam company. took my money and ran with it";4.35137;28577;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/5d/a0/56/5da056aa-8f42-f4eb-666c-7b7990bb1385/cb9ded41-eb70-42ba-87c6-2d4e8f1106f4_4-5.5_inch_-_iPhone_7_Plus-my_trips___5_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/28/bf/0b/28bf0b57-95fc-a229-b2ee-dcae5c6b8553/68b4ceb3-4aee-4819-b463-1ecf1710028d_6-5.5_inch_-_iPhone_7_Plus-dynpack___5_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/88/e1/00/88e1001f-8bff-d3e9-6b74-78794a4ffa21/6ea033d7-d221-4b59-ae3f-305967a8cc1b_2-5.5_inch_-_iPhone_7_Plus-checkin___5_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/83/af/30/83af3081-9bbd-aa93-2236-c79f5217e65e/ce465a9b-8f22-4dc4-acbb-180160ae1ae6_3-5.5_inch_-_iPhone_7_Plus-flight_tracker___5_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/77/88/56/77885657-472b-9f48-89cb-9cc6b0ededb8/db021fbb-9f52-4fad-9891-7487b9f955f6_5-5.5_inch_-_iPhone_7_Plus-cross_sale___5_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7d/3c/6d/7d3c6d5d-db46-802c-dd58-7955c6d9be4c/e41e60cc-48b2-44da-a0c9-9fdd270aa9d6_8-5.5_inch_-_iPhone_7_Plus-prime___5_5.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/d8/d8/83/d8d88389-17fb-5700-95ff-e78433bc0ebc/9630d796-db58-4a58-86e6-e8944ab7ec3d_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00285th_generation_U0029_-_2022-01-12_at_10.49.43.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1d/df/89/1ddf899e-e794-178f-a2c1-6717e801ab88/b08d1587-5acd-4f15-a305-9438a10e1945_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00285th_generation_U0029_-_2022-01-12_at_11.02.13.png/576x768bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

ABOUT AUTIO

Humans are moved by stories. Stories that make us laugh and cry. They move us to come together and do amazing things. Since the dawn of time, stories have been the way in which values and knowledge are passed from one generation to the next ‚Äî each adding their wisdom and experience along the way.

It‚Äôs time to connect with the sum of our experience, to enrich our lives with the stories of today, and to inspire the great storytellers yet to come.";"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/29/15/28/29152850-3551-669d-ebf8-03d325487caf/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-5-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg";"[""Travel"",""Entertainment""]";"[""6003"",""6016""]";"Travel";6003;"12+";"[""EN""]";"74723328";"13.0";"2020-08-04T07:00:00Z";"2024-03-18T14:20:31Z";"Grab your passports: Autio is going to Ireland!

It‚Äôs a freemium subscription model, though, which may not be obvious to all. Decent value to me, though. | I guess I‚Äôll post this again?? 

I‚Äôd give this negative stars if I could.

The app has deceptive advertising and poor UX/UI. The stories are not user generated and might as well be someone reading a Wikipedia article about something to you. 

Pressing the pause button skips to the next story and there‚Äôs no way to escape the subscription page, forcing you to close the app. | This was good when it was Hear Here, but it‚Äôs taken a ‚Äúlong march through the institutions‚Äù (iykyk) hard turn into leftist racial lecturing. If I wanted to hear that I‚Äôd walk into Berkeley‚Äôs latest drum circle. I don‚Äôt want to pay to listen to screeching Marxists, that‚Äôs what the university system is for. | I accidentally signed up and now I have something I dont want for a year!
Why can I nit cancel after 1hour, just finding out I have a subscription!  
Boooo! | Notifications don‚Äôt work in CarPlay, and it should suggest stories within a radius of your location. It should also work with Maps to navigate to the point of interest being talked about. All these things were promised in the YouTube video, but don‚Äôt work in CarPlay. I want my money back!! | Unfortunately the app was super glitchy. 
We were disappointed to not be able to use it on our trip! | Many of the names and locations local to us were mispronounced, and some of the stories were not correct. It made me doubt the accuracy of all the stories I was not familiar with. | I love hearing all the stories when I drive but wish there was a little more‚Ä¶
- stories that don‚Äôt repeat 
- stories that align with the direction I‚Äôm driving. 
-stories that are near where I‚Äôm driving and not 100 miles away in a direction that I am not driving
-stories that are told before I‚Äôve passed an area and not 1 hour later
-stories that automatically load into the app so I‚Äôm not playing with the app while I drive

I drive to many unique places. The stories make the places I drive by much more interesting , plus keeps me alert. But the app is also clunky and non intuitive.  So many times I‚Äôve stopped listening because I can‚Äôt mess with the app while I drive. | It will only work sporadically. A waste of money | I love having this app tell me about the places I‚Äôm passing.  The stories are just long enough, super diverse and always interesting.  Can‚Äôt live without it now. | How fun to hear about your own Neighborhood and the places you drive through on your travels!! | Tried using this app via ‚ÄúCar Play‚Äù while traveling through Yellowstone.  Although I had location services turned on to ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù the app failed to update the playlist as I passed new Autio points of interest.  I could only access new content if I opened the app on my phone which defeats the purpose of hands free Car Play. | Little surprises as I drive around. Our family is really enjoying this app! | Love the idea. As soon as I heard about it I downloaded it. Tried out a few of the free stories. They were great. Not overly detailed but good. After I ran out of the free ones I checked out the plans. WAY too expensive for what it is. More than Spotify or so many other apps that honestly provide more value. Too bad but I won‚Äôt be able to use this based on the cost. | I am a trucker LOVE this app I love learning about the different stories and history of the areas I run and just little tid bits and I even have saved some stuff I would love to go see one day!! That I had no idea was there before this app!! Would recommend 10/10!!! | This app now collects data on how you drive in an effort to market car insurance to you.  They have not made clear precisely what data they collect and have not offered a way to prevent such data collection, short of turning of location devices which would completely deprecate the utility of the app.  The privacy description in the App Store should be updated immediately to reflect this, and an opt out function should be clearly defined and provided. | Makes your trip fun! It‚Äôs unique to listen to the history of towns you travel through. | It would be great if there was an unbiased narrative of the history of the sites. But the strong does of political opinions makes this an inaccurate source of the facts. | Not as advertised very few stories even in important areas. Maybe 10 more years of work it may be useful. | Information is very valuable but not always reliable as to the actual site of the incident. | Headed out West and tried the trial - The 5 stories I listened to in the trial seemed like the hero is never Roosevelt or an American explorer. With Autio, the native Americans are always the heroes and the white man/explorers are the villain. Never mind and mentions very little about the exploration or engineering feats achieved at that time. 
An example would be with Mt Rushmore: there is so much more history/how it was done that I wanted to learn about after visiting it. But the focus seemed to be on the Lakota Sioux being forced out.
I can greatly appreciate the history there but I wish that wasn‚Äôt the sole focus. Would love to see the app being more well-rounded. | I have always wondered about the places I pass when driving. Now I know.
Great App | I live in the center of Pennsylvania and there were 5 stories in like a 3 hour radius from my area. The big story from my city was ‚Äúthe courthouse was the place of the Sandusky child sex abuse scandal‚Äù Of course they said some other things but for real! First no one wants to hear about a child sex scandal while hiking. I‚Äôm close to Penn state university. Plenty of nice things they could have talked about. I‚Äôm sure anyone that was involved in that hearing does not want to hear about it highlighting the area while hiking. Poor taste in general. Not a fan of the app at all. Too overpriced for literally nothing. Not nearly enough content. I would give it one stars a thousand times over | I should be able to trust this as historically accurate. I live in Cherokee County Alabama and was surprised that one of ""Our Landmarks"" was
""The Jeminson-Van de Graaff Mansion"", Which is 150 miles in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
I immediately deleted the app. | I use carplay and the notifications don‚Äôt pop up or make a sound to know that there‚Äôs something nearby.  If I happen to see that there was one on my phone and tap on it, it will start playing.  But it then continues with a bunch of stories that are either way behind me or ahead of me.  I‚Äôd like it to turn off and go back to my music.
Would also be great if there was a setting to just automatically play something when I‚Äôm nearby.  I‚Äôm mostly driving an RV by myself and don‚Äôt like to be distracted by fiddling around with buttons.  
Those 2 adjustments would make it a 5 star. | I recently took a train trip from Tampa to DC.  This app really helped pass the time.  I only wish that there was access to more American History and not just the lesser known stories.  Would love to see some regional on-demand history stories. | Autio finally got the car app working but it‚Äôs just a list, no map integration

Also the stories can be a little dry. I would almost prefer a riff channel where entertaining folks comment on the present gestalt of a place rather than just history. | I love the idea and the stories are really informative and entertaining. We are going on a grand Amtrak trip this summer and a search function would make this perfect. | Do your homework.  Intentionally racist reporting? | It a perfect traveling companion for curious
Road trippers. It‚Äôs fun to learn the history near 
Where you live too! | It‚Äôs a good idea but you only get 5 free stories then you have to pay. Not that many stories where I‚Äôm interested in to make it worth the investment. | We love listening to the stories on the Autio app. Wish this had been around a long time ago. Such a great idea. Makes driving trips much better. | Professionally produced and narrated stories that transport you to another time. Often as I drive through the places narrated in the app, I can almost feel as if I‚Äôm there whether a center or a decade ago. Countless discoveries in my own hometown. Look forward to taking the app on the family road trip. I know the soothing voices of the narrators will keep my daughter entertained for a bit. | I saw this app on Shark Tank and as a truck driver decided to download it. I‚Äôve had the app for about 30 minutes and not only have I learned things around me, I‚Äôve learned things about where I live I never even knew. | I seen this app on Shark Tank. I am wondering if there is a chance in the future that you offer the service for free with ADs. | Why do apps block my password manager or make it difficult to use. I gave up creating a log in when I couldn‚Äôt access 1Password easily. Seems like an interesting idea but too much effort required to try. | Deleted immediately after seeing the monthly subscription option. Give me a one time flat rate or give me nothing. | Excited to hear the rich history in my favorite places but all I heard was the white history. Nothing about the indigenous peoples or miners who lived in the area.  The areas were Colorado Ski Country- keystone, Silverthorne, Dillon. Out of touch! | Exactly the type of information we should all be wanting to absorb when traveling thru parts unknown, or even seemingly known. I‚Äôve learned more about my hometown from Autio then in just being here. I love everything about it. Cool when folks like Kevin Costner and  Phil Jackson drop in with a story even now and again, too. Five big stars! | Great idea but it didn‚Äôt work for me. I got it for a cross country RV trip but didn‚Äôt get to use it even once. Couldn‚Äôt log in. Now I‚Äôm notified that it‚Äôs up for renewal. Difficult to cancel. Waisted $35 of my travel budget on this app. | I love road trips and the stories in Autio have guided me through travels on both the east and west coasts of America. They are entertaining, educational and humorous. The app works seamlessly as you travel from one area to another. Wish Autio was around back in the days when I had an RV! | But we were going on a road trip and I figured, this would be a good investment for some entertainment.  Well, we‚Äôve used it on 3 road trips in the western US and have learned a lot of things you wouldn‚Äôt normally get from a textbook‚Äîand it presents the pieces to you when you‚Äôre right in the area each thing happened!  Pair this with Mike Rowe‚Äôs 10-minute ‚ÄúThe Way I Heard It‚Äù podcast episodes and you‚Äôll keep your brain going on your drive.

This was worth it.  I wish it was just a one time fee and not a subscription, but I get that they have to pay for all the research and all that goes into making this app.  I think it‚Äôs well worth it! | Makes driving much more enjoyable !! | I love this App, it gives you a lot of good information. | I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing stories based on my current location as I drive around.

Update: it still says that I have no saved stories and even though I tell it to update all the time, now both the iPhone CarPlay don‚Äôt show any stories! | I listened to five stories as a free trial.  The copy could be lifted straight from a roadside plaque.  The facts hang there suspended in motes of the driest prose illuminated by scintillating narration but still bloodless.  In this age of ubiquitous brilliant podcasts I need better writing or a well-produced interview.  Even Kevin Costner can‚Äôt make me care about these stories. | We are enjoying this and look forward to using it again but narrators or producers really need to make a quick call to the State Travel board or any state native and get their pronunciation correct.  There were a dozen mispronounced names or words listening to the Utah state stories.  Just a tiny bit of homework would have fixed that and the mispronounced words or names really distracted from the stories.  And it made you doubt the correctness of the facts. | The stories are great and well put together, but the app is only as good as the cell signal. We like it though. | I got a new phone and I am trying to reset my password.  I can reset it with the link they send to my email but can‚Äôt use the new password to log into my phone.

Not disappointed at all! | Good app to use when trying to find affordable vacations! | Great for finding good deals | Great value deals and all inclusive packages! | Good app not many deals from Denver though | This is such an easy an accessible way to plan vacation deals | Great app thus far for travel deals! | This app sends me notifications specifically tailored to what I'm searching for!  There have been so many terrific options that I'm having trouble narrowing it down! | Informative and love the deals | Very convenient and easy navigation throughout the app. Highly suggest it for planning out a vacation. | These deals are absolutely unbeatable.

So far I have only used it to search for potential trips and have not actually booked anything. The only improvement I would make is the ability to narrow your search down a little more. For instance if you want a trip for adults only you shouldn't have to go to a nudist resort to do that! I have gone to an adults only resort that didn't have a clothing optional setup! | Great app, friendly use, very complete info, excellent prices ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | This app isn't bad but the review ratings likely are overstated because of the contest being run when you rate the app. People tend to overstate their true reactions when incentivized with a chance to ""win"" $500 and will provide meaningless raves in the belief that they'll have better odds at getting the $500. | Awesome app, I've found many deals already | Love this app because it helps me dream and plan a vacation. It's quite well organized and some of the deals seem really good. I haven't used it yet but hope to soon! | Easy to use and navigate, easiest travel app I have found so far!

Do not try the general English line | Great website and super cheap prices, but the app is constantly crashing and is nearly unusable. | It‚Äôs showing high prices compare with other Apps | I booked a flight one night for $344, which was then cancelled because ‚ÄúThe price went up as I was purchasing the ticket‚Äù. I checked the next day and it was the same price. I called and asked why I‚Äôm not able to book the next day after checking and they said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unavailable‚Äù so I asked ‚Äúwhy is it still in the website‚Äù and the lady kept putting the blame on me and avoiding the question and told me ‚ÄúYou can pay over the phone the higher price and a $10 manual payment fee‚Äù. Absolutely ridiculous. You‚Äôre better off using Expedia | I love this app I got best rates | Every time I try to view my trips, it bugs and just closes the app. | Since downloading the app back in November of 2023, I have not been able to see any information regarding my trip abroad after logging in. I instead received the message saying ‚ÄúSomething went wrong try again later‚Äù. Please fix | Doesn‚Äôt give you any more of a discount on flights than any other site and often makes you flights non-refundable. I don‚Äôt see the point of the site and would not recommend using it. | My flight was canceled due to the 737 groundings and the airline texted me to notify me of this and said I would receive an email with more information about next steps. I never received such an email from the airline. 4hrs later I received an email from student universe notifying me of this change, asking if I wanted to accept the absurd new flight they booked me on. This was after I had already tried to call the airline about the absurd new flight (2days after my original departure date and an 18hr layover), and called student universe to try and get a better flight. I thought this issue was handled after I spoke to the second student universe representative - the first one had no idea what he was doing. I rebooked a flight on a new airline, as I was told I was getting a refund, only to learn when I landed, that they still had not contacted the airline for a refund, but had instead booked me on yet another absurd alternative flight. Just absolutely horrible experience. I thought student universe was a great company for the prices, but their customer service is not worth the lack of price. They will not be in any way helpful if any thing happens to your flight. You can tell them what you want to happen, that you cannot add 2 days to your trip, that you want to decline the offered alternative flights and just get a refund, but no. They don‚Äôt listen and don‚Äôt fight for you as the customer | difficult to use it. no live chat. | Run if you plan to use it! | I am trying to look for a ticket and it‚Äôs showing me prices but then it says the discounted ones aren‚Äôt available unless I verify my status and when I upload the document it just keeps saying uploaded and never actually finishes and I waited for over 10 minutes | This app charged me $30 extra for the flight when compared to other airline sites and to cancel it within 24 hr booking they are charging $40. | I recently had a frustrating experience with an airline and Student Universe. I opted not to take the initial leg of my flight and used alternative means to reach my destination. However, to my dismay, the airline cancelled my return flight without offering any compensation. This left me with no choice but to purchase a new return ticket at additional cost.

When I reached out to Student Universe for assistance, they were unhelpful, citing a clause in their contract which states that if a passenger does not use the first leg of their journey, they forfeit the entire trip. This policy feels quite unfair and was not adequately highlighted at the time of booking. The lack of flexibility and support in this situation was disappointing, and it‚Äôs important for potential customers to be aware of such policies and the implications they might have on their travel plans. | I can‚Äôt even look at available flights without the app crashing. I had this installed for about 2 hours before trashing it. | They charge you higher than just booking on a regular site | The site not even work when you try selecting from where u want fly it‚Äôs not even give you option don‚Äôt waste time for this app‚Ä¶. | Wasn‚Äôt able to print out itinerary, or save to My Wallet. I can‚Äôt find my ticket in the app at all, don‚Äôt like this app. | This app is so slow to load, regardless of what kind of connection I‚Äôm using. I can‚Äôt even load the hotel page because it takes 5+ minutes. | Super easy to use and amazing student discounts. With all my school loans, I will take any student perks I can get! Thanks StudentUniverse! :) | This was a waste of time and false advertising! The prices are the same on any other website. Don‚Äôt waste your time or phone storage downloading the app!! | Amazing | This app is deceitful and manipulative | It says I need to update the app but there is no update to offer on apple and I cannot use the app. | It promts me to update but I don‚Äôt see the update in appstore. Can even use the app. | If you download and open the app, it will tell you to upgrade to the newest update, then take you back to the app store ‚Ä¶.. but there is no update . | i heard about this app and decided to compare air fares from google flights. i was able to locate the same exact flight on google and compared it to the one on this app. i found that google flights‚Äô fare was 6 dollars cheaper than this app. 
if you want to verify this, just pick a random flight on google flights and look it up on this app and compare to see. | Because I book tickets for my mom
And I request for wheelchair but 
She can not get any wheelchair 
Tickets is India Ahm to Washington DC
Any airport | Student Universe is my go to app for flight bookings. | Oh wow, did not really touch food ever in this place | Worst platform to book the flight. If we want to postpone or prepone the flight they are charging more when compared with other platforms. Better to book a flight in direct airline sites. I don‚Äôt want to give rating. | I had a horrible experience from airport staff and contacted studentuniverse but they were unresponsive. I tried contacting them multiple times. I contacted my bank and the airlines directly who gave me the refund for $1700 for the inconvenience. But these crazy people, not only did they rebilled my account after4 MONTHS with $1700 again, even after telling all the details what happened, they as a merchant straightaway lied to the airlines to finally rebilling the amount from my card again. This is the worst website you could choose for getting $10 bucks of discount and then you‚Äôre going to suffer later and you could never expect any help from them. Studentuniverse are very active only when it comes to sucking money out of your pocket. They told the airlines I cancelled the ticket, but in reality I was talking about the one way ticket where i experienced this whole situation, not during the return ticket which I cancelled later. (For which I never received the refund btw) I would never ever recommend anybody to book from this website it‚Äôs a total scam they don‚Äôt care about the passengers at all!!! | Won‚Äôt save nothing, plus very difficult to communicate with and customer executives aren‚Äôt supportive | It‚Äôs cheaper if you go through the website of the air line | I‚Äôve been using this app for about a year and a half without any issues. However, since the last update, it‚Äôs been crashing while searching for flights and it‚Äôs now impossible to use. | Just there was an easy way to add trip details to my calendar. I have to do it manually. And when I share my trip info with my gf, she says she has to enter in my email address and confirmation number to view the itinerary‚Äîso many unnecessary steps.

Product owner needs to ask themself why they chose to implement the ability to explore next trip based on user‚Äôs zodiac sign over the ability to add to calendar. Bad choice IMO. | A friend of mine told me that this was a good app to find good prices as a college student. Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt been able to see if it‚Äôs as great as she told me because it wouldn‚Äôt let me confirm my student status, and I‚Äôm scare of but the tickets without doing that first because what if they raise my prices last minute because of that? What if they end up charging me more claiming that it‚Äôs because I never confirmed my student status? If anyone can help me with that I‚Äôll be more than thankful and happy to change my review | I fly a lot, a lot a lot, I flew booking with student universe too, gave them second chances at thought maybe it‚Äôll save money. NO. Please listen it‚Äôll save you so many headaches, they won‚Äôt and can‚Äôt save you anything. Absolute scam, their whole MO is making customers think they‚Äôre paying less, but they NEVER BOOK YOU WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. They always say ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù when you book BUT ITS ACTUALLY ECONOMY LIGHT AT BEST. Not even light, the ones with absolute no carry-on/baggage at all, last second tickets that other companies toss away. If they tell you that going in, whatever, but be prepared to pay an extra $300 USD for every international flight (the whole flight is only $400). There‚Äôs no way to know what flight they‚Äôre booking for you since they lie and say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know baggage allowance‚Äù and you don‚Äôt know until a few days before when you can check in to your airline‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs so fuqed up who would book an international flight without even a CARRY ON??? The whole thing is so shady, so deceitful, zero transparency. They know what they‚Äôre doing, ridiculous company that scams ‚Äústudents‚Äù without being upfront on what kind of flights are being booked. Their profit margins must be huge but they have zero ethical values. Hopefully they get sued someday, this happens for every. flight. I‚Äôve. Booked. Basically booking.com with less transparency and false assurance of ‚Äúhelping poor students.‚Äùü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è a lot of you might be like me, false hope it‚Äôll save you something, please I beg you just avoid, you have enough stress on your plate as is. | Way to expensive | I‚Äôve always had a lot of years of student universe. Their stuff are super helpful and quick to rearrange flight plans. Their app is easy to use and I love their prices. | I haven‚Äôt found any relevant deals for me and decided to delete the app because I also didn‚Äôt feel comfortable giving any ID information, but the app simply won‚Äôt give you the option to delete your account! | Love it. Short, Sweet & to the Point. | Easy to sign up but I did not see anywhere to confirm a flight or check-in.  Rates are ridiculously inexpensive! | ^^ | There literally just isn‚Äôt a reason to use StudentUniverse. They add fees with no clear benefit to using their services and terrible assistance. They‚Äôre trying to charge +$700 for a flight change. Save yourself the headache and just book straight through an airline, I‚Äôm not even sure why this company exists. | Twice my booking was cancelled for stupid reason. Won‚Äôt recommend it to anyone. | i‚Äôm looking for newark, nj airport flights and keep showing me La Guardia, NY information why??? | I love this app, not many adds, hustle free and really good prices, if you‚Äôre a student or under 25 years old I‚Äôd highly recommend using this app | I love Student Universe! I book almost every flight with them because they have great deals and I‚Äôve never had any problems.

You can easily switch direction of conversion with one button, i.e. from U.S. to UK and vice versa.
Love this! | Great apps | This app is great for converting usd to colones used in Costa Rica! | The app is alright. It doesn't let me paste values, so I often find myself retyping a number I already have in the clipboard... Also the UI is slightly confusing, especially switching the currencies I often press the ""switch"" button subconsciously after I type in a value, thinking it's the confirm/equals button.
Also it doesn't remember the currencies I frequently need to calculate. I always have to search manually when switching. | This app is so helpful when you travel and don‚Äôt know what exact is the value of the  country you traveling so you feel like no one can take advantage of you if you don‚Äôt know how to cover the dollar to their money you will love this app 10 out 10  üëç | Must have it specially if you travel üôÇ | I use this for work a lot because I have to convert currency. I use this A LOT. Recently the conversion rates are slightly off, please update it to be more accurate! | Used this app regularly in Mexico and it was super handy to get an idea of how much your paying for things in usd quickly without doing math in your head and trying to communicate in a language other than your primary language | est√° buena, nada m√°s q decir | Does everything I need. | We travel quite often my husband &I ! I love this app. It‚Äôs always accurate, easy to use , we‚Äôve been in various countries, within a short amount of time Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, Qatar, Malasia, Thailand ,Mexico, Europe and every time I had to reach for a currency converter this app. has been very efficient. It updates according to currency  changes automatically. Highly recommend. | I use it all of the time so that I can see how much something is going to cost me in my own currency. | This app is helpful to people that need latest 
Exchange rates for business and personal information, thanks for the app. | We used this app recently when traveling in Mexico. It was so easy to use when we needed to figure out the cost of something. it is easy to switch back-and-forth between currencies when necessary also. | Perfect simple functional accessible easy to use.  It‚Äôs my go to app when I travel | We recently used multiple occasions while we were on vacation in northern Europe summer of 23 and found that it worked very well.

I use this in all my transactional needs. | I use it all the time a needed tool | I used it all the time in Brazil to know how to tip, even tho majority of the places don‚Äôt accept tips | Great tool to have when traveling.

Only complain is that it only saves up to a few of  countries we‚Äôve used ever.  
All the currencies we‚Äôve used should be saved so that we don‚Äôt have to go through the whole searching, typing the country‚Äôs & locating again. Thanks. | The exchange rate is off. | Traveling through a few different countries and I‚Äôm trying to use the favorites setting to quick save the different conversions I may need. No matter how many different ones I add, they all revert to the current one I‚Äôm on. If I convert MYR to USD, then check my favorites. They‚Äôve all switched to that conversion.

If I add a new one, it takes the new countries currency and converts it to the previous countries currency, example: MYR to USD, then I go into favorites to check Indonesian to USD, all my other pre-saved conversions have swapped to MYR to USD. If I add a new one like Indonesian, it swapped to Indo - MYR. Not my construes currency I need. 

Doesn‚Äôt make much sense why it would auto convert the other country Im trying to convert from. 

Extremely annoying. So annoying it made me write this entire review, which I have never done in my entire life lol | Simply to use | Excellent easy to use and covers all currencies that we work with
Tremendous guide to what one can actually get when doing conversion at a bank or money changer | Hello. I liked this app but I can‚Äôt find info for BYN/USD Belarusian ruble to American dollars.

Simple add on of a currency pair is not possible as it switches to different currencies on its own and creates a huge mess.

I didn‚Äôt even get asked a question and they just sent me ‚Äúrefunded $10 credit to Kiwi.‚Äù This had not even been 24 hours since my booking. I called them and they said that since I was refunded $10 credit they couldn‚Äôt help me. I spent $322 and before a day had passed they would NOT refund my money. I called my bank, but because I used a debit card they can‚Äôt do anything. This is a scam! I am so disappointed. I tried to call again today and they disabled my booking number so I can‚Äôt even contact them. My last resort is to leave a bad review because you guys really took $322 from a student. They said they couldn‚Äôt refund me cause the airline had my money but my bank statement shows they haven‚Äôt even confirmed my money yet. 
It would be really appreciated if you would contact me and maybe give me something more than a measly $10 credit(that does NOT even COVER a luggage) absolutely pathetic and cheap.
And trust me I will be sharing my bad experience over tiktok. | The app is just links that take you back to google anyway. But I‚Äôm mostly mad because they cancelled my flight 3 hours before my flight was supposed to leave. I got my refund but it screwed me over. I definitely would not book last minute with them. | They did not help me and now I have an 8 hr layover and will miss an event. I called and was dismissed saying there was no option to help me. I won‚Äôt book with Kiwi again! Don‚Äôt book with them because a cheaper flight means they can change things on you with no help and no understanding or options. I‚Äôm very disappointed in their services. | I downloaded the app to check in, but after seeing this company wasn‚Äôt based in the US, I was hesitant to provide my passport number, which they said was needed to check in. So, I decided to check in with the airline. However, when I have tried to locate my confirmation number, I cannot find it anywhere in the emails they‚Äôve sent or in the app. This is understandably incredibly frustrating, as I either have to provide further personal details to a third party that are unnecessary or reach out to them to find a simple confirmation number. | Ten√≠a mis dudas pero quiero decir que cumpli√≥ con los compromisos y todo sali√≥ muy bien en un viaje de 3 escalas todo puntual, buenos precios ü´° | I have booked 2 flights on Kiwi I haven‚Äôt gone on either one just yet but if you are traveling aboard I suggest using this app to book low cost flights.

And it risks your sensitive info being hacked and available on the internet. | Me han facilitado todo el proceso de compra a diferencia de otras p√°ginas, adem√°s de eso los precios que dan en comparaci√≥n son la mejor opci√≥n es r√°pido y sencillo hacer todo en esta app me encanta y la recomiendo 100% | Compre un boleto hace un mes para mexico gaste como 287 dolares Pero lo cancel√© antes de 24 horas de haberlo comprado Llevo esperando mi reembolso Y resulta que solo me devolvieron 10 euros Mi dinero se lo quedaron ellos.

Worst customer service abilities. I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to speak to a manager. I asked repeatedly. No one was able to assist me. When I finally found a teller in the airport, they were like this is a continuous issue with kiwi, and they refused to book the correct flights. I will actually be telling every person I know to never ever ever book on this site again. you all made my trip so much more stressful and I almost missed my flight because of you always in ability to click a button while booking the flight for your customers. International Mexico travel requires you to note that you were a non-Mexican resident and pay the additional $41 tax fee but you all don‚Äôt wanna do that for whatever reason. terrible service. | Honestly, this is the most unethical scam, artist company I‚Äôve ever dealt with! If you have a problem, it will be nearly impossible for you to reach anyone to help resolve it. And when you do, they will screw you over and not help. I booked the flight and found out later that they changed my flight to a week earlier without telling me. When I finally after many attempts got in contact with someone, they pretty much admitted. The mistake was on their end, but said they couldn‚Äôt rebook me on another flight because that airline didn‚Äôt except check in luggage. So I went to the airline directly, and it was a lie, they do except check in luggage. So I bought directly with the airline. Then I tried to get a refund for my incorrect ticket, and they told me no and close the case. Do not book with Kiwi! | Thank you | Just downloaded the app and had a great experience and looking forward to using Keewee more in the future | Helps finding flights by dates and has all kind of filters to find your perfect trip. | I purchased my tickets through Kiwi, apparently it‚Äôs just cheaper to purchase airplane tickets directly through airlines hot charger $40 extra compared to airline website. Additionally they refused to provide refund within 24 hour period which is usually US law to my understanding. | Cost me so much money to rebook while at the airport they are using fraudulent credit cards to book with airlines then airline cancels their booking. Support team is terrible and do not care | My flight that I booked over kiwi was delayed which made me miss my connecting flight. When I contacted kiwi they told me that I had ample time to make my connecting flight which was a lie since  I basically rushed in order to make my connecting flight once I got off the plane. Costumer service was not helpful or even offered to help by booking a new flight. My itinerary stated that ‚Äúwe will jot leave you stranded‚Äù which they absolutely did. Worst third party service I have ever received. Please do not book anything with Kiwi. | Do not book with this agency they will book your tickets then tell you after words that they require more money  this company is a scam and when u need to speak to customer service they will give you a ring around | Incredibly misleading process. After booking the flight we received notification that our tickets were all purchased separately so we would need to leave the airport then check back in. With small children we decided this wouldn‚Äôt work. Upon examining our refund options we we were led to believe that we would get a credit to be used in the future on the site. THIS WAS WRONG‚Ä¶they refunded us $10 of the $1250 we paid. I‚Äôve done a ton of international and domestic travel and this is one of the worst experiences I‚Äôve had. Unethical. | Kiwi will literally steal your money and never (ever) refund it. They will change your messed up booking to another messed up booking then downgrade your ticket so you can‚Äôt ask them to fix their second mistake unless you pay even more money. Please don‚Äôt make the mistake me and my friend made. Kiwi stole over $1200 of our money, and didn‚Äôt start notifying us about issues with our booking until 120 days after booking. This meant we could not dispute the charge, get our refunds and move on. They know full well what they are doing and are not worth the stress. | Kiwi.com is a scam app! They will find every reason to not refund your $$$! Do not use them for anything! Save yourself the hassle and their bait and switch tactics! Horrible dishonest people! | Don‚Äôt waste your time to install this app, kiwi.com has highly misleading business practices. Coming from Google flight search, the price for a flight was USD 672 on kiwi.com. They offered a USD 48 discount on the app. But then the price in the app jumped to USD 719 while still USD on the web after refreshing - what a scam! I would rate this app zero stars, if I could. | The only reason I even put 1 star is that the review will not allow me to submit 0‚Ä¶ 

 Kiwi.com is a scam. All recent reviews suggest extremely problematic business practices. Their customer service support is intentionally dysfunctional to save them money and make changing your flight imposible. My friend and I bought tickets for a trip. They later changed our itinerary to leave and come back on completely different days from what we bought (and from each other). We both spent extra for ticket options where you are allowed to change your flights up to 48 hours before hand. We contacted them to change our flights entirely and they ended up putting me on hold and changing to my flight to something completely different from what I had asked. When I explained the correction they said we need to write to them with the details of the flight we want. We have done this at least 10 times back and forth. Each time they ‚Äúput in a request‚Äù which takes days to process and then they respond ‚Äúflight change not possible please enter new flight details‚Äù. This is despite us screenshoting the flight details directly from Kiwi.com‚Äôs site like they instructed us to do. I have asked for my case to be escalated to management a number of times which is also ignored. The fact of the matter is, we bought tickets with the option of flight change, however their customer support policies/ procedures make this (seemingly intentionally) imposible. I will be filing against the company to better the business bureau as well as bringing the case to small claims court. Big businesses like this should not be able to take advantage of people like this. My friend and I do not have a lot of money so spending money on a trip is already a stretch and now we have nothing to show for it. | stay far far away. i called the airline directly to workout some issues with my flights. they decided to fully refund me and help me re-book. no problem. EXCEPT they had to refund my original form of payment which apparently is Kiwi‚Äôs bank account. when i called kiwi to request a refund be made back to my card since my refund from the airline was in their bank account they told me because of the type of tickets i purchased i was only eligible for $10 in kiwi credit. really?? even though they had received my $500 refund from the airline, they were only offering me $10 in credits!? do yourself a favor and spend the extra $40 booking directly through an airline. | Absolutely horrific app, non existant customer service, and take days to confirm a booking. Then when you request a refund for the flight they failed to book, they only give it to you in ‚Äúkiwi credit‚Äù it can‚Äôt be legal for them to charge for a service they failed to provide. Give me my money back. Apple, look at the reviews and take this app down | This company is a SCAM NEVER BUY FROM THEM. I got my flights through Kiwi from Atlanta to phoenix. The morning I had my flight Kiwi emailed me saying that my flight was cancelled. The flight was not cancelled. I was able to get on my first flight but not the second causing me to be stranded across the country. I had to buy an additional $600 in flights through airline companies just to get to my destination and back home after the trip. 

The company will not answer your phone calls. They are a scam and will not help you. They put your name in with the airline companies but you most likely won‚Äôt be able to get onto your flight. You don‚Äôt get a confirmation number from the airline companies either.  

Luckily my credit card company was very helpful and kind and was able to get my a refund. But a $200 round trip flight ended up costing over $600 with lots of stress added. 

They are a scam of a company. It‚Äôs ridiculous that anyone would be so rude to scam people and strand people in unknown places for their own benefit. Don‚Äôt book with them. | I bought 2 tickets to Chicago
The company on the last day sent that registration at the airport is required, at the airport an employee said that the company works semi-legally and they can not register, only sell new tickets .... lost $ 300 that was not returned | Stole my money. Use a more reputable company. They told me my flight was not available and tried to charge me more money. I tried to get a refund. They cancelled my flight and then wouldn‚Äôt give me the refund. $3,354!!! They tried to give me a credit for another purchase for $10! Not okay. They should be shut down | Avoid use this App at all cost, it‚Äôs a scam. the prices are not cheap. The service is horrible, I can‚Äôt get my money back even after my flight got cancelled because I didn‚Äôt pay extra for the premium service. And it takes months to get credit back to use for my next flight. Buying a ticket in this app means you can‚Äôt return or exchange at all. Or you pay a lot more to do so. The app also trick you to pay more for luggage that‚Äôs already included with the ticket. I still have credit here that‚Äôs not used but I would rather leave my credit than using them again. This company should go bankrupt, they don‚Äôt deserve to have customers. | I cannot board a flight due to a very valid unforeseen circumstance. They won‚Äôt issue me a refund, throwing the terms and conditions at me even though the airline is willing to issue a refund. | How can I upgrade from a saver ticket to a standard or flexi ticket?  It seems ridiculous to me that you can‚Äôt do this. | I don‚Äôt like how they force you to download the app just to get your boarding pass‚Ä¶please email it to us | fake application be careful they stole my money | They have the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever received in my life. I booked a ticket through them with bags included, and when it came time to check in the airline told me that I owed the balance for the bag, when I contacted Kiwi to try to get help with that they kept on telling me that everything looked good on their end. The airline would not let me check in until I pay the balance so I had to pay it because I needed to get on my flight. I emailed and called kiwi to try to get a refund and they will not give it to me. Do not book your flight or travel through this app. | This is by far the worst booking app I have used ever. First, it took them a entire day to book the flight after I made the payment. Second, they screwed up my baggage credit so that I have to buy the check in baggage credit at the airport. Then my flight got canceled and Kiwi did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!! It didn‚Äôt inform me the cancellation; refuse to refund; and offers ridiculous price for reschedule new flight, the new one way flight is the same as my original round-way flight. I have never seen such disguising practice in any business for a long time. AVOID IT LIKE A PLAUGE!!! | I missed my connecting flight with Volaris due to a flight delay with Viva Aurobus and they won‚Äôt assist me with my connecting flight or any reimbursement! They told me Kiwi is responsible | I read all the recent reviews, DEFINITELY NOT BOOKING WITH THEM deleted app! | DO NOT BOOK WITH KIW! | This company is terrible. It‚Äôs really bad. 

You probably won‚Äôt loose money like me. They make me feel like a joke. 

First of all They canceled my baggage service. After that as a human I had to cancel the whole flight. They NEVER refunded my flight and now I‚Äôm $500 damaged.

After talking to the support claiming my money back the informationthat I had was (Sorry. You cancel the trip in a non-refundable ticket)

Well, I just cancel the flight because they cancel my baggage service. And looks like I‚Äôll never see that 500$ again. | Absolute scam canceled my flight (that was booked well in advance) at 4 am week of the flight. Left me no choice but to overpay for a last second flight. I can‚Äôt even get a refund for this until 3 months time I can ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù get reimbursed?! Absurd way to scam an active duty service member during the holidays. Everyone involved with this are fraudulent. If you‚Äôre seeing this spend more money for a better flight through a different vendor, through a different app because it actually save you more money by not getting scammed! | Works worse and worse with time. Out of 3 last flights once they booked a wrong flight telling in the app it‚Äôs correct and twice they screwed up hours (one causing me to loose a flight). Their service used to be good, now it spreads misinformation | This app was nice to find a cheap flight (as long as you don‚Äôt mind spending the night in an airport). However, one thing that was super inconvenient is that the boarding passes in the app do not update that gate number, leaving a permanent ‚ÄúTBD‚Äù status. To find your flight, you will need to look up the flight number online or in the airline‚Äôs app. | No refund of money in case you cancel your order. Just look online at all the horrors stories ppl have posted all over the word . Some clown criminal has made is company .. I have lost close to 5k with this company. They use some loopholes in laws . Evil .. | Signed up for an account through Apple and bought a price lock. Info was sent to a random email I have no access to. App freezes when you try to update your contact info and change your email. No way to contact Kiwi support unless you book a flight. No way to see purchase history for price lock in the app. Extremely frustrating that I payed the price lock fee and will likely have to pay even more for the flight because I have no access to the price loco. 0 stars. | Despite the numerous options the app provides, many users consider it a waste of time and almost a scam. This is because the prices constantly change during checkout and after entering all the travelers' information. It seems that what we initially see during our search is merely a bait. It is essential for Kiwi to seriously consider this issue, as ""bait"" marketing is illegal in the European Union. With a few complaints, they could face a hefty fine. | Had a terrible time with this agency as verifying my identity in regards to booking a Ryanair flight through Kiwi  was a huge disaster and landed me with a 55 euro fee. This company is not easily accessible, and impossible to contact. Stay away! | I booked a flight for $950 and had to cancel within one hour I was told I couldn‚Äôt get a refund but I could get a credit. I got a credit tried using it and charged my card again another $500. I was told I would get my $500 refunded it‚Äôs been 4 months and still hasn‚Äôt seen my account. | I have traveled a few times with this site and I have encountered issues but everytime I have been able to get a fixable solution with customer support, they are very helpful. | They told me my flight was cancelled but when I checked directly with the airline they told me that the flight was on schedule.

Load times are long and it‚Äôs hard to find information (like how many checked bags and carryons are allowed with your fare). It is ultimately an app that fronts for a slow mobile web browser. I‚Äôve also yet to find a way to log out of the app, as I‚Äôve selected the various menu options and have yet to find the option to do so. | Been flying JetBlue for years now and won‚Äôt fly another unless JetBlue don‚Äôt go there but they go everywhere we wanna go.   Flying Mosaic is a plus. Haven‚Äôt had a bad flight.  Customer service is very accommodating and the flight crew are always kinda and prepared. | Unable to update my JetBlue app because it does not support my smartphones OS Version. Now it seems I cannot use the app to access my boarding pass. Come on jet blue, help me out. | Keep up the good work | This app is trash. No matter what dates you choose, you get the same results that no flights are available. And yet at the very bottom lower right, it reads that you can book through 2025. Make it make sense. | Amo Jet Blue excelente servicio al cliente. Asientos c√≥modos, puntuales. √âXITO | Excelencia. Servicio, buen recurso humano cortes√≠a,  responsabilidad, snack buenos, asientos confortables , entrenamiento to variado  y amabilidad | Even when the tv doesn‚Äôt work and there is a tiny delay JetBlue is still the number one choice for all our air travel. | User friendly and accurate. | Staying on top is hard but, from ‚Äúnever‚Äù problems to almost always! And the negative PR is bad‚Ä¶ | Got bounced from my seat, and JetBlue tried to get me to pay to be assigned a new seat. Serious consumer fraud and a ‚Äúbait and switch‚Äù. I am yet again reminded why I am loyal to other airlines. | When I use it today, this App does not use my Face ID and keep giving me ‚Äúincorrect email and/or password.‚Äù When I clicked ‚Äúreset password ‚Äú, a dialogue appeared. But it disappeared before I could type anything. How can such a buggy update to be released??? | Wonder app from JetBlue | I thought this was going to help me but it didn‚Äôt I was looking for a plan ticket to El Paso TX and apparently they don‚Äôt have it in the search bar | First time in 18 years, traveling to my country of birth what a comfortable flight friendly flight attendance, a wonderful experience.
        Thank you, | Used these guys twice.Both times the had major flight causing us to miss appointments.Going back to Delta | The app is ok for this however, no option exists that I could find for ‚Äúflexible dates‚Äù | JetBlue flights clearly the best. On time, quality planes, capable staff. JetBlue > Delta > All the other airlines | If you have checked and paid bags during booking, you should skip bags selection during Checking In process to avoid double charges. | Easy to use..updated information | The app worked perfectly until the most recent update. Now when modifying date range it will not change them most of the times causes the app to crash | I really like the app.  The only think that I wish would work is the iCal calendar.  It hasn‚Äôt worked for awhile.  The Google one works, but I have an Apple.  Please fix it that it will open | If you decide to fly JetBlue, buy your tickets on a computer browser. I bought plane tickets this morning over the app and it didn‚Äôt go through so I tried it again and it told me there was an issue with my banking institution, which was wrong. It ended up going through and it charged me, but I never got a confirmation email so I had to call JetBlue and their customer service is terrible. the customer service representative told me that the charges for my checked bag and reserved seat didn‚Äôt go through even though it charged my bank the full amount. She told me I would have to give her my card information over the phone so that I could buy the checked bag and the reserved seat. I did all of this and then she told me I would just be buying the checked bag and reserved seat, but then she charged my card all over again for the full amount of the ticket, bag, and seat. I didn‚Äôt notice this till later, so I had to call them again and they said that I should just be getting a refund in seven business days, but the first lady never told me this. This has been the longest day of my life, I will be needing therapy after. | Please have the decency to had a summary feature of the trip before I pay. I had to start over because I couldn‚Äôt see the date and time. | I was flying to Las Vegas and got a terrible stomach virus in the middle of the flight. I passed out, I got sick everywhere, and was sick for the remainder of the flight. The flight attendants were kind and understanding and very helpful. It was still a really bad situation, but with their help I was able to make it through the flight. I will be forever grateful | Good | This app makes my life easier very grateful to have it at my fingertips | Last JetBlue flight from LAX via a JetBlue connection departed 15min early, stranding about 35 passengers in LAX till 3:30AM. That was about a year ago and I decided to try it again due to a scheduling constraint. Boy was that a huge mistake. I board the plane early, and having PAID for a carryon bag, tried to put my bag in the overhead, only to be refused by the flight attendant, because my bag was small. Meanwhile, gate agents let everyone board with their oversized carryon roller bags. Flight attendant was the stereotypical passive aggressive troll we all see in the movies. Then got to sit on the tarmac for an hour while JetBlue had some scheduling system error. This airline line deserves to be bankrupt, I hope the acquisitions are blocked so some new competition can get into this market. | JB needs to increase the flight options with all the partnerships that it has and let the clients use their points. | Terrible customer service terrible airline. Robbed me multiple times. App doesn‚Äôt work forced you to call then charges you for calling. Terrible everything. | Love Jet Blue and the app. | Can‚Äôt use my blue points, JetBlue credit and my credit card at the same time. | I love how easy it is | Just error messages, totally useless | Jet Blue is a great airline to commute from Hartford to fort Myers direct. It is very comfortable with good room in all seats, I am 6‚Äô2‚Äù. Also, I have flown to LA, and other US cities with great service. Give them a try‚Ä¶ | I like the JetBlue app, it keeps me up to date with my flights and boarding passes | Love JetBlue and this APP | Very good app and appreciate the like to incoming plane info.  Adding food would be great. | Does what it‚Äôs supposed to do but I mean jeez. It‚Äôs been the same app for many years. No changes. It works but it‚Äôs clunky for a large billion dollar corporation. This would be next level if the iphone just came out in 2008 but today it‚Äôs a little dated.

2nd review, 2024
Was just asked again about this app and I‚Äôll just have to leave my previous quote alone. I don‚Äôt like to sound harsh but Deltas app is like 100x more smoother and useful. I like JetBlue but come on let‚Äôs give the app a little renovation | Great job Great Service!! | Love this Jet Blue App! Its so easy to use and always opens, loads, gives info- stays updated!! keeps track of points! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | Necesito saber cual es el costo adicional por una maleta mas yo viajo el 19 de febrero del 2024 por Jet Blue desde fort Lauderdale a Guayaquil Ecuador me podria facilitar esa informacion gracias | Very easy to navigate‚Ä¶ Thank you JetBlue for not having me think too much. Quick and Easy‚Ä¶ | Excelent app and service. | I changed my flight and lost my flight and couldn‚Äôt even used my return. Very upsetting!! Originally paid $206 Roundtrip for March 1 through March 4 and moved it for today and charged me another $405 to changed it for today for an emergency!! That‚Äôs almost $700 down the drain for nothing!! The worst airlines ever!! And no carry one bag! That‚Äôs insane!!! Non refundable! | Just signed in on the new phone and the app is asking to turn on my locations at all times. The setup page don‚Äôt go away if you selected Track only when using apps. No buttons to exit the page. Welp, I guess I‚Äôll use the Delta app. | The people that are in the call centers are the best I have ever dealt with cusps to jet blue | JetBlue app takes the hassle out of flying | SO glitchy.

Even though old card is expired I can‚Äôt change my old user name to the new card. I tried contacting support to delete account but they were worse than useless. | I‚Äôm unable to update my personal information from my iPhone including my address and card information. I do like that it automatically finds the nearest airport. | Unable to retire e passwalrd or username due to nonfunctional buttons. | So, I keep seeing signs at establishments that have the Priority Pass logo and then once I present my card I'm told it‚Äôs not valid if the card is issued by AMEX or Capital One. THAT‚ÄôS certainly not something that is advertised. | I‚Äôve been a member for two years now and have been able to use the Priority Pass in many airports - almost all the airports I‚Äôve gone through have some PP option. 
The cost compared to what you get is really an outstanding value - definitely recommend to fellow travelers. | Almost no clubs at US airports | Several times we had to wait to get in the lounges. Cabo, twice and in Atlanta 45 minutes wait for one lounge and went to the other and it was a 15 minute wait and all seats were taken had to sit at bar stools. | LAX has no any lounge and it‚Äôs very poor! | Card expired and I cannot update the new expiry date in the app. | If more recent photos could be added would be great. Adding map of the airport to show location and walking time to lounge would make this 5 stars! | Cannot get any help AT All very disappointed traveling today to Denver oil maybe made a mistake with Capital one venture card | I recently had an unpleasant encounter with the front desk attendant at the Cibao airport Priority Club. Upon arrival, I expected to be greeted with warmth and professionalism, but unfortunately, I was met with rudeness and indifference. The attendant seemed disinterested in assisting me and displayed a lack of basic courtesy.

Not only did this tarnish my experience with the club, but it also left a negative impression of the entire establishment. As a frequent traveler, I value exceptional customer service, and this experience fell short of my expectations.

I hope that management takes steps to address this issue and ensure that all staff members embody the level of hospitality expected in such a setting. Until then, I hesitate to recommend this Priority Club to fellow travelers.

Thanks
Juan | It is a good perk to have when you travel but it is dissapointing that some lounges have limited hours, some that dont change their food/menu for months and months and some that you can access only before security check or if you are in transfer, you have to exit, go to lounge and then pass security again and that is what does not make sense because you will ‚Äúsave‚Äù money but waste a lot of time. Not bad anyway | I love this app because it quickly tells me what lounges I can use in any airport! | Half the lounges in this app don‚Äôt accept priority pass and the rest have a quota so you will be often turned away. I feel bad for anyone who actually pays money for this thing 

The priority pass lounges are often cheaper busier versions of nice lounges (Phuket has 3 lounges listed but only the smallest one accepts the card) or none (SFO we walked around for an hour to try all 3 international lounges and none let us in)

Also the map in the app is totally useless ‚Äî it has routing but you can‚Äôt search for a gate or locate yourself! | The Bangalore lounge denied me access because I didn‚Äôt have my physical card with me.
I had this app. I was logged in‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt find the virtual card. | Why have this pass when nothing is ever available? | No lounges via Priority Pass in LAX. Zero. Nada. Not good. | Holding a chase sapphire  reserve credit card, we travel a lot from LAX. No lounge here. | I have been to several lounges that say they don‚Äôt accept priority pass. For ones that do, the app here often has wrong opening hours or amenity information. 

In some places, Priority Pass is nearly useless anyway since it‚Äôs so over-subscribed. | Information is consistently wrong. Really fun to walk to a lounge and find you don‚Äôt have access, that the times are wrong, etc. Considering that priority pass is a membership you‚Äôd think they would allocate some funding to make sure this app is correct | We were surprised to learn that they would not bring out any more omelets because they were all out. Hot water was also out.  However, I must give a shout out to Alex who went around tables to clear finished items. He works hard to keep the tables clean. We really appreciated his diligence. | Unusable

Just make the card digital already.  It‚Äôs comical that you have to show a physical card at lounges | Friendly staff, very good hospitality! | Zero coverage in many major airports, but options plenty at others.  If your favorite cities around covered, it‚Äôs not much help. | Very crowded at 10 am on Sunday with many small loud children, think of a day care center.  Broccoli salad is excellent.  Services are great. | There are very few lounges available even in the largest airports. I‚Äôve been able to use it twice in five years and I travel every week. That‚Äôs just how useless it is. Two times I encountered lounges that were advertised to accept Priority Pass only to get turned away that they were not accepting Priority Pass for entry at that time. Think twice before accepting that included lounge access via Priority Pass is any benefit (eg, credit card programs). It is not. | Does not clearly identify the lounges, terms, and locations, even at major airports. | What a piece of garbage! I have no idea how this app is rated so highly. It‚Äôs terrible! You can‚Äôt update your home address or the card on file. It‚Äôs impossible. To add insult to injury, if you leave the app when in the middle of submitting an inquiry for help, and then return, the app wipes out everything you‚Äôve entered. Terrible user experience. The development team should be fired! | Trying to update new cards is a joke | The app is not very user friendly and does not provide a lot of information that is helpful. | No matter how many times I attempt to purchase a Priority Pass, it does not go through with my Groupon code. Each time I attempt to purchase it, it does not confirm registration. It keeps stating that it needs to confirm my identity. I don‚Äôt know how to get use out of this code and Groupon is no help.. Do not buy this. It‚Äôs a rip off! | Disappointed in the choices in most airports. Limited to certain concourses in all airports or like in Phoenix, nothing at all :/ | The app won‚Äôt display my digital card because it says my account expired.  The account area shows it expires in 7 months with 9 visits remaining and my account auto renews. | We are currently at Sangster Airport, Jamaica, and the agent at Club Montego Bay made it clear there is no vacancy. It gets even more bizarre; walkups came and paid while we were standing there. Upon further research, it was indeed available to access if you paid online. | Nice pics on app, but impossible to find the lounges at Chicago or Frankfurt! | The app refuses my membership number and validation code. Refuses my membership number and last four digits of my Amex card. I now have a completely useless membership. Pathetic. | Terrible experience in setting up the pass. Could be made lot easier and safer than this! | There is no priority pass lounge. | App is almost unusable. Won‚Äôt allow me to add my digital cars to my Apple wallet. It won‚Äôt allow me to edit info in my profile and half the time I can‚Äôt even log into the app. More interesting is the review average shows almost all 5 stars but when you read the 5 star reviews, they appear to be mostly negative. Looks a little like the developer is cooking the books. | You basically have to use a traditional website to make sure everything works well because the app does nothing but tell you where lounges are and substantiate your credentials. Nothing else inside the app works. You can‚Äôt update billing or account information. You can‚Äôt activate an account. The features are there visually but do nothing. Good idea but the app is half-baked. | I am unable to make changes my account info in the App even though there is an ‚Äúedit‚Äù button. So I can‚Äôt update the expired payment card on file. I even tried making the changes on the website with no luck. Last resort was to call customer service and the representative put me on hold for 15 mins before getting disconnected. SMH | Extremely disappointed with this so-called benefit. What was once a nice opportunity to go to a lounge and relax and be comfortable is now nothing more than the privilege of ordering, buying, and picking up the food from a restaurant! | I‚Äôm writing to you about the bad experience with your lounge room experience every time I try to get in. With no success today I am was told that I have to wait one more hour to get in because my flight leaves more then four hours later. I‚Äô m very tired and I have 10 more hours to go to my flight to Chicago and I can‚Äôt get in because of this rule. I‚Äôm very disappointed with American Express. My husband and I have been a member of American Express for more than 40 years and we have seen a lot of changes but this time I had!!! It‚Äôs very frustrating and I don‚Äôt think I can deal with this kind of situation every time o came to visit this lounge!! Every single time I came to this lounge I get panic attacks and have the worst feeling that I‚Äôll be stopped and denied entry. And of course! Today I‚Äôm waiting outside. I‚Äôm wandering if this is the way you treat yours.

Ana agorio | When it works it‚Äôs good, but many times the lounges say no Priority Pass during certain times and that‚Äôs the most likely times of travel | O‚ÄôHare lounge never works. They do not allow economy class in even though there are seats available | Good selection of lounges. Though not all are here.

I can do so with record time. Thanks for making it so simple! | My only complaint is it doesn‚Äôt have a horizontal mode.  The screen doesn‚Äôt switch and I have to type while looking at the screen sideways. | Awwsome i love it | Easy to use | Love the service. Straight forward and hassle free. Thank you | I enjoy the privilege, but I really wish that I90 would have faster response time to issues that we have and refunding in less than 10 days | Great NonRev travel listing site. Fast and easy. A must have for nonrevs. Simple to navigate, one stop shopping for travel. | I haven‚Äôt used ID 90 for a while. Mostly, it was because it was such a difficult process to work through, but now! Wow! Easy and intuitive. Great job tech team. | Best vacation deals ever! | Great app, great deals, and great service | Always use this app for hotels | In the palm of your hands... Deals across the board... You can customize the perfect experience and not break your pockets! A must have App! | Easy to use and very simple to navigate | A must have for international travelers.
Best app to use when traveling worldwide | So easy and convenient! | I love ID90 Travel! I appreciate the notifications about flt loads and the option to modify my trip before the date. My only suggestion is to be able to modify my trip to find another flight even after check-in in case I do not make the flight because of space unavailable, for exemple there are 1 to many non rev on that flight, then I lose the booking instead I could proceed with the same booking on another flight! | Is great | Easy to use. You know you're getting the best prices. Easy to use. | The app was very easy to use | So far this app have been very helpful securing good rates no issues | I was hoping this would be the so where I could get the cheapest rate over the more popular sites and sometimes it is and sometimes it isn‚Äôt. Plus there are no flight deal options so you would have to use 2 different sites if flying anywhere | I‚Äôve used this app more than any other travel/industry app. I‚Äôve always have gotten the best rate on! I would give it 5 stars if I had the option to be kept signed in. Sometimes it can be a problem | I love it    :-) | I get the best rates. | I find the best resorts and all the accommodation I need for my travel. | This is a very helpful app you would allow you to travel more at discount price | Great app for retiree like me. | Great tool if you know how to use it. But I have so many questions. 1) how do i book a flight? Or do I just show up to airport? 2) for non reving with family is it common to be able to get a flight or is it hit or miss kind of thing? Will we possibly have to be waiting around all day to fly? 3) is there any way to buy or upgrade seats? 4) on cruises are they per person? Also, can the same rate apply to someone not on my family list? | Good deals easy to use. | You can‚Äôt see the phone number or certain fields when completing your booking. | Sent to IT and it seemed to fix the issue.  Booked a Trip earlier and handle to cancel.  Cancellation process was very easy. | I love this app. It‚Äôs easy to navigate. When you refer friends the 20$ credit is available within 12hrs after they have checked out. At least so far!! Only problem is, the screen goes white quite frequently and I have to power off my cellphone in order for it to properly work again. It‚Äôs a huge inconvenience. For this reason I gave a 4 star. | Great perk to have while working in the air, line, business or air transportation. All air carriers offer this to all employees. | Love | It‚Äôs really convenient and good for easy booking. The only thing I wish they had more filter for you to make a better selection. They have every hotel in Airport in the area however. | Great app been using it for 5 years now and have used it many times on vacation | It‚Äôs a very nice clean, upscale property. Just be aware that even if paid in full, they want a $100 a night hold for incidentals‚Ä¶‚Ä¶plus $35 per night in fees. They are willing to accommodate you however if you can‚Äôt pay both. | Love it | Use it for all many aspects of pass travel | Very helpful | Great site. Simple to use | Great deal for my Singapore trip.  I save a few hundred and they included free breakfast. | I use ID90 when I plan a trip or unexpected travel. I am usually very pleased with the services and ease of use. | Truly loved the application!!!!! Very user friendly | Good service! | A very good app | This is such a great app for those who work in the travel industry.

A6 is NOT Randen Tengingawa!! That station is A5. Obviously some of the other numbers are off. | This was super helpful on our trip to Tokyo. Easy to plot our rout and get exactly where we wanted to go. Only thing that would make it better would be to add the platform numbers to the transfer stations. Hardest part on transfer is to know which platform to be on. Other than that, great app! | Costs $2.99 for one map. No free maps at all unlike previous reviewers say. | Great app but needs to be updated more often‚Ä¶ it is missing lines in cities where it makes it inconvenient to rely on the app. Basically, if your city is updated or hasn‚Äôt added any lines, this app is great for you. | Hi!

 These are not all the changes that I have named.

The Osaka & Kyoto maps by themselves is incomplete thus inconvenient.  The Tokyo map on the other hand is perfect, including Yokohama, Kawasaki, Saitama etc‚Ä¶ the entire metro area. | San Francisco is listed as included, but the app can‚Äôt find or open it. And apparently you have to pay to map more than one city. | Great aesthetics on the map but not the most update one!

Can help update the newest extensions on Hong Kong subway system map? | The Worcester line of the Commuter Rail is missing the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Boston Landing station, which was opened on May 22, 2017.  So, basically I just wasted my money on this app because it cannot be trusted. | I love putting the markers for bars and restaurants and things to do and save them so it‚Äôs easy to see where everything is in relation to where I am. Love it! | A LOT of free city maps that were available have been swallowed up into this app, which charges you at least $3.00 to open any of them. Eff you, no way. | Keeps wanting you to pay for orldwide upgrade, just need seattle | Every time I try to use this app it forces me to upgrade, which I do, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the prompt again. I‚Äôve tried several times. | I have now used this in Tokyo, Seoul, NYC and Hong Kong.   No other maps needed.  And well worth buying the entire world.  This is now my go to travel map... | Paid to download map for use offline and got nothing. | Worthless is all I can say | Really loved being able to use this app to look at maps and especially plan routes on my trip while my phone had no regular cell service! I wish I had known in advance that only one map could be unlocked for free. | Tokyo subway system is really complicated with subway, light rails and hundreds of commuter rails like blood vessels. | You can‚Äôt use this app for free... | The map is too expensive, not worth the money at all, considering you can always use the google map and other free apps.ÊÉ≥Èí±ÊÉ≥ÁñØ‰∫ÜÂêß„ÄÇ | This application does not show subway exits on their map, nor is it responsive in selecting a station for review. I had to keep poking around for quite a while to get any reaction.
Frankly, this software is a rip-off - I can not recommend it. | There are inappropriate ads that appear along the top banner. How can this app be approved for ages 4+? I was about to recommend that my teen download this app for an upcoming trip but since you‚Äôre not paying attention to the content of the ads I won‚Äôt be recommending it to anyone. | They only give one map free which is fine. However they don‚Äôt warn you about it first. So I unlocked one map (Hiroshima) without knowing it‚Äôs my only free one. But I‚Äôd much rather have Tokyo which I am visiting first before deciding to buy any others.

Unfortunately there‚Äôs no way to undo my selection and there‚Äôs no upfront warning that you only get one free selection, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving this a low rating. | Otherwise you have to pay.  That isn‚Äôt any better than downloading individual metro maps for free. | Baixei o mapa do metr√¥ do Rio de Janeiro, cidade que moro, para verificar se o app era bom. Pedi uma rota da barra da Tijuca at√© Cantagalo (Copacabana), que fa√ßo sempre e da 15 min de metr√¥. Mas o app simplesmente deu uma rota bizarra indo para Madureira, depois central do Brasil para depois chegar a Copacabana, totalizando 3:55h de viagem, e de √¥nibus!! Fala s√©rio! Imagina se eu estou numa cidade que n√£o conhe√ßo? S√≥ vai me meter em furada essa porcaria. Desinstalando em 3, 2, 1... | We are going take an urban | Streamlined and simple to use
Well done | What I despise is the way this app was ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù via a free ‚ÄúTokyo Rail‚Äù app which didn‚Äôt do anything but consumed data and redirect to this new for-pay app.

Better be honest upfront. | Wanted me to walk half mile instead of taking train right out in front of me | Not very user friendly, had to use to apps to get where I was going. Gonna keep trying again, until make final assessment. | Would consider buying if it had bus maps too. Also, it is unclear whether maps are kept updated in line with changes in official maps. | Only gives you one route and tends to be a longer one. Would be much better if it gave you the best route or options. | Fails on numerous accounts,

Doesn‚Äôt have my home town, Dallas metro (DART), a metro area with numerous lines and airport access.

Near totally useless for the country with  the most cities with subways...  China.   

Google maps and Apple Maps have this info for, wait for it, free.

Why or who would use this app? | Confusing and does not accurately represent your location or directions in Milan. | Until yesterday this app was great. It now has intrusive ads on the screen even if you already ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù (i.e. ‚Äúpaid in some way for‚Äù) that city. One star. | Apple and Google Maps do a much better job with transit, are easier to use and are free. 

With City Rail Map:
There is no attempt to show the next train as there are no schedules.
There are no addresses for train stations, though there is a small map which does not indicate your location. 
There is no way to purchase tickets. 
It costs $4.99 to unlock one city. The above are free. 

I do not understand the rating this app gets. Apple and Google Maps are free, apps from the transit companies are free and far more functional (schedules, ticketing). | And then still wouldn‚Äôt work. | This app used to have important maps for free. Now they‚Äôre charging you for every map you need/want except one. I‚Äôm a traveler around Japan and the world and find it very useful but not anymore. You‚Äôre probably better off using Apple Maps because they have train routes all over the place now. | Tells you to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to another one of their free apps.  Then this app is only free for 3 days.  The app will not allow you to do anything, says support is ending soon.  Money wasted on this. | After using for a few days, the app locked itself up. 

Interface is terrible to navigate. Resource intensive app. Slowed my phone. | Very helpful to decide if I should travel by transit or taxi. | Confusing. No start option or Go option. No en rout help. Just shows a picture of the total route. You‚Äôre on your own. | Used this for a month in Tokyo and it was most useful for getting around.  Highly recommended. | The route making is very mechanical. You should be able to use the train map to create your route just by tapping on the stations. Also, the app lacks information on what gates to take, what floor or platform number to go to. | confused a little to bkk visitors";4.56203;3288;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/3a/76/bb/3a76bb97-73df-7b3d-623c-e8ea01729b4d/mzl.pthcstas.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c6/81/b0/c681b0f3-eaa6-13c6-9e73-1c657dd98208/mzl.joqfwqva.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/b6/5f/66/b65f660a-e53f-5b05-e697-b2b433d355ef/mzl.iirzesut.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5d/ea/bd/5deabded-6e70-0891-eb00-3eae628270e1/mzl.qrkvmiuu.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/27/11/2a/27112adc-7783-c26a-997e-cd85dea81859/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/95/11/25/951125b6-e314-eda2-8547-bc3360761e09/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/d0/2d/97/d02d97db-22ea-3ad7-1686-c27db48f6ad0/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/59/a7/c2/59a7c26f-c23b-d99a-bab3-457e72a43cc0/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/18/f9/28/18f9289b-af6e-0a8b-3ab0-8de4bce7da1a/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

But there‚Äôs also access to a mentor who I am able to ask individual questions to as needed. This is priceless! | This is hands down the best app for tracking cards, annual fees, and rewards. And the card genie feature takes all the guesswork out of the churning game. So glad I found this app. | Zac has personally answered any and all of my questions, super helpful kind! | The Travel Freely app has been great to keep track of my multiple credit cards. Whether you have just 1 credit card or 40, this app will make keeping track of your credit cards a breeze. | Love the app. Very concise & easy to use. Info is easy to see. Lots of info | My favorite feature on this free app is that it organizes your credit cards and sends you an email when you are close to the annual fee time, and it tells your how many cards in the last 24 months you‚Äôve opened (so you don‚Äôt go over the 5/24 Chase rule). Soooo helpful!! | I can‚Äôt thank you enough for developing this app! The organization, the features, ease and use of using the app, and the information is what makes this app so amazing! I frequently refer to this app to make informed decisions of what to do next. Thank you again! | Love this app and everything it does! The only request I have is to be able to add multiple businesses under each person. | Thanks to Zac and travel freely for all of the guidance. Zac is always quick to respond and provide advice. | This app is AWESOME, but sometimes it just won‚Äôt open. Even uninstalling and reinstalling doesn‚Äôt work. | And never able to open it. Even after killing the all and reboot the phone | App is not reliable. Cannot go through the checklist without having to sign in again and again. App is wonky and basically unusable.

Update:
Zac and his team have super responsive to my complaint. They have replicated the issue and have kept me apprised of their progress. I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed with them. Zac even sent me a gift card because my review helped them I.D. the issue. I‚Äôm able to use the website to input my info right now but I‚Äôm confident they will get the app corrected soon. This is the right way to do customer service and I heartily recommend Zac, his team, this app and the Travel Freely site. It‚Äôs a great way to track your cards and the key dates you need to get the most from your cards. Thanks Zac! | This is so useful to track credit cards as well as provide information about timing of getting cards and best travel crafts to get. Have also found the articles to be helpful. Thanks for making this a free app. I definitely find it useful!
-Katrina | The app is a godsend when it comes to keeping track of multiple users with multiple cards. Keeping track of dates (annual fee due, bonus due date) is something spreadsheets can‚Äôt do as well. Highly recommend it for people in the credit card game, both beginners and experts. | I love this app.  I can keep track of points earned, my chase 5/24 status and when cards will drop off my 5/24, and even discover cards I may be interested in next.  Has been monumental in my organization as I have started my travel hacking journey. Doesn‚Äôt ask for personal info on credit cards and I love that! | This app has been very helpful in my process of learning the points and miles hobby! | I still can‚Äôt believe this is a FREE app! Thank you, Zac, and team for compiling your credit card knowledge and honest recommendations for those of us who want to play the miles and points travel game. I hear there‚Äôs a Cash Freely version focused on cards that offer cash back options too! | I love this app! Makes it so easy to keep track of all my cards in one place and when I can apply for my next. It really simplifies what can feel overwhelming at times! | I highly recommend Travel Freely. The app is great and the founder Zac Hood answers emails very quickly. They also have mentors available to help you with the points game. Zack even sent me a free T-shirt. Travel freely treats you like family and I hope you give them a try. | great app to help keep me organized and knowing when my renewal is due. i love the genie recommendations to help me decide which card is best for me | This app has helped me make the most of bonus mile offers to plan some fantastic trips! | I find the Travel Freely app extremely useful. Not only does it help this beginner keep up with cards, the information about cards and the card genie are great!
Zac has responded very quickly when I needed answers. Thanks for your help! | I like how this app recommends what cards you should get and also keep track of when your annual fees will come up and gives a nice review of almost all the cards. I also like how the app creator is available to help and answer questions. | So happy I heard about this app from the Travel Hacking Moms podcast that Zack was on. I‚Äôm so used to keeping excel spreadsheets for everything but this app is so simple to use that I don‚Äôt have to do that! You have access to everything you need to keep track of your cards, annual fees and I really appreciate the available resources right from the app! Highly recommend, especially if you are new to this! | When I first learned about using points and miles for traveling, I was completely overwhelmed. There are so many cards that offer so many different promotions and it‚Äôs really hard to keep everything straight. Especially if you are a two or more person household. This app makes tracking my progress and what cards I have and what cards I should consider easy. I would be lost without this app!! | I‚Äôm still in the process of learning all about traveling on points and this app is awesome at tracking all of your cards, when your next annual fee is due, what cards both you and P2 have and other suggest cards.  So far I‚Äôm loving this app and highly recommend | This is a game changer for keeping track of my rewards cards and going above and beyond with a simple way for me to look up the perks of each card or even make recommendations about which card to get next. | Now that I am in the points and miles game , I was a little overwhelmed by all my new credit cards and spending categories

This app organized everything and it was right on my phone. Now I know what points I have and what CC to use | I‚Äôm a beginner at using credit card points and this app is very helpful at keeping me on track with next steps.  Thankful for the guidance! | This is the best app to use to keep track of what cards you open, when you hit the minimum spend, when you earn a bonus, etc. I also love the card genie feature which lays out the best credit card deals! | Just getting into all this points stuff but am loving the app & solid recs on how to get started & keep long track of your cards. | A clean and handy way of keeping up with your travel credit cards! The app also give you insight into special offers you might otherwise not be aware of. They also dont ask for personal information. | This is a great app. Keeps all my info organized and makes it easy to see what fees are coming up. No glitches so far, and best of all, no annoying pop up ads. | Great app for compiling all your info in one place. So much great info here to help you with points, credit cards and travel. A great resource! | Super easy to follow and track everything. Love everything about it so far. | This app was created by a former teacher.  Awesome. Very excited to save money and travel the world | Honestly this app has helped me so much. They give the best signup links, help keep you organized and focused on the goal (traveling freely) and great card recommendations as well! | I am so grateful to the creator of this app. It is a must have to keep track of your credit cards and the points system. I appreciate the tips and tricks that it provides along with the email reminders‚Ä¶priceless. Thank you, thank you! | I‚Äôm new to the game but love the info and organization from the app.  I emailed a question and response was fast and helpful. | Great app that‚Äôs simple to use and helpful in so many ways!! | Love how easy this app is to track all of mine and my credit cards for both me and my partner | I love how it shows all your cards and tracks important dates for you! | Great app. Organizes personal and business credit cards with the information needed. Not bombarded with advertisements. I had a question regarding eligibility and Zak got back to me with the advice I needed   I do make a point of using the app to apply for cards to support them. | Just discovered Travel Freely a couple of months ago. This app was created so thoughtfully to help beginners in the award travel and credit card bonus space. The step-by-step guidance couple with the video tutorials from Zac are very intuitive and effective. Thanks! | Totally free and so helpful! Their blog has a ton of amazing information. | I‚Äôm new to the points and miles game and I appreciates the simple straightforward guidance. I also am getting regular emails from travel freely and get this - I emailed Zac with a question and he emailed me back within a few hours with the answer!

(Yes, I travel a lot!).

I emailed Support and haven‚Äôt received a response.  This new app is not as good as the previous one.  Sorry for the poor review as I really used and liked the earlier version! | Multiple steps required- and then the verify email does not work.  Then I get ‚Äò too many tries‚Äô at that verification.   If I was cynical I‚Äôd say the end result is dissuading me from filing a claim , despite having paid a sizable premium. 
Not impressed. | any trip from 2024 past and future did not move to new version 
i hope they can migrate over | no guidance to provide documents for claim | This insurance has become part of my travel pack. great service fast, response time and affordable. Thanks for Allianz! | I am impressed with how easy it is to buy travel insurance.  The policies rates are fair.  I use only Allianze on my international travel. | Unknown why policy when viewed in app cannot be emailed. Error messaging is not clear at all. | Do not waste your money, our flight got canceled due to maintenance and these scum bags didn‚Äôt even try for a second to assist us in anyway. | Very well designed app and website. Easy to find what I needed. | Especially links to documentation information, they do not work. | I find it very confusing to know how to add things to monitor. Such as a car rental, Airbnb, etc. unless I‚Äôm mistaken and it‚Äôs only for flight, I was told by the agent who signed me up that it was trip insurance to cover my trip and that I would be able to have all of my different items in one location so it would be easier to monitor while traveling abroad. The only thing I could find was to add my airline, not the car rental or where I‚Äôm staying. It would be helpful if it was either easier to find to add these items or if it‚Äôs not already an option if it was added so that all of these things (even if they‚Äôre not completely covered), would be listed under one location instead of having to have different apps for everything. | Looking to waste tons of time? This is the app for you! Nothing works and your policy will be wrong. You will be unable to change it but not for lack of trying. | This is the fourth time we‚Äôve used Allianz travel insurance when traveling international. One of the trips, my husband had to go to the doctor twice because he got very sick. Allianz reimbursed us for his dr visits within a day of turning in the receipts. I was very impressed. | I put the TravelSmart app on my phone so I could have the information on my policy during the trip as the paper print out would have been 55 pages. The policy will not print out even though it shows my information and basic coverage. | Renewed an annual policy and although I was emailed a confirmation, it does not appear as a current policy here on the app. | Nice | App does not allow more than one claim.  I have multiple | I have recently been involved in a accident that has put me through a great deal of stress and without a car for the event i got tickets for. With this happening i am forced to work that date to make money and all this is covered under the insurance i purchased through the event yet they make me feel like im a criminal trying to get refund that i paid insurance for in the event something like idk LIFE happens? They are ridiculous and be very careful with this company i have yet to hear back from them, debating on sueing the company. | I purchased the insurance protection for my round trip to Chile.  I am trying to contact you after four hrs waiting setting on the plane. Did found out that the aircraft is having hydraulic problems, as a former aircraft crew chief, the issue is going to take more than the time that they are telling us. This is unacceptable, I do have the issue now and can‚Äôt wait until tomorrow to file a delay flight. 
Please advise 

Thank you | They lead you to believe that if you can‚Äôt attend an event for any reason you‚Äôll be refunded. Lie lie lie! They rip off innocent people thinking they are covered. | A simple 999 dollar mistake? Bought the insurance, booked the flight. Immediately discovered mistake. The so-called Priceline ‚Äúapp deal‚Äù was non-transferable and non-refundable. Really. Does it being legal make it right? | Easy to use appüëç | My husband and I don‚Äôt travel without Allianz travel insurance; they always on point with everything. Excellent service!

Thank you Mrs. Godson | Slow.  Once you make a change can be cumbersome to RE-engage the policy on the web site. | Password is not being saved to my keychain. Have to enter it manually every time. | Website/app is very easy to use and very self-explanatory. Thank you! | It would be helpful to have concierge services available via the app. | This TravelSmart app doesn‚Äôt update to another Apple device even when signing into the same acct with email and passwordüòû | The coverage is a joke. I do not have any 'pre-existing medical conditions'! This is the basis for a $250 refund. I assume that it would be impossible to get a refund otherwise. Why would I get coverage? The small print is astonishing! I will never get reimbursement for anything. You are a bunch of venal individuals who have no integrity. How do you sleep at night? | I renewed my all trips  policy on July 26th and paid the premium. OnAugust 6th I got an email saying ny policy was expiring in 15 days. I checked the app, and sure enough it showed my policy expiring on the 21st. I then logged in on their site, and no record of my renewal. I checked my credit card and it showed the $715 charge had been paid. After a 20 minute telephone call, I learned that the policy number had changed. The lady on the phone said it takes a while for the update to show up on the app and website. She suggested I delete the app and reinstall it to see if the new policy shows up.   Seems like there could be improvements made on the site and app, so transactions show up more quickly and emails are not sent about an expiring policy, two weeks after they‚Äôve been renewed. | I could not email the policy to myself. That app had a problem. | They created this app so they could get more data from you phone. It is a web based app so it actually just runs off their website. No options to opt out of data harvesting. Deleting this after my show claim. Never buying ticket insurance again. If I can‚Äôt go it is easier to just sell the ticket than deal with this company. | Would not use this company filed a claim for lost luggage the day it happened. They were given every documentation required that I had or was given. Continued to deny they received, even when I showed proof they received thru email and uploaded to their website.  After 4 months of going back and forth, still nothing.  They closed the claim, had it reopened after escalation still nothing.  Spent $1000 on the insurance for trip.  Don‚Äôt waste your money too! | What a rip | Just Thank you for being there | Allianz emails me and tells me that my policy expires in two weeks.   Renew. Now!    But there‚Äôs no apparent way to renew with in the app or on  the web site.    Pretty useless. | Allianz has pulled through for me many times on trips. This app makes it possible to have everything at my fingertips. While it‚Äôs still smart to have hard copies of policies and contact information on trips (in case there is no internet connection), the app really makes it possible to get help in a hurry. Great app!  Thanks for providing wonderful service. | Used Allianz before on our Hawaii trip. Claims 
might seem slightly long but was covered across
the board on everything. You will not be disappointed with this company. | Very easy to use, and such a life saver! I would definitely recommend this event insurance to anyone who has a shadow of a doubt that they may not be able to attend their event. It was easy to file a claim without the app, and even easier and more streamlined WITH the app! | Woman in Customer Service located in India spoke so fast could I could not obtain her name but she did accommodate my email change as requested. | What a help for travel!! | Wasn‚Äôt too sure about Spending the extra amount for the insurance because 1 I wasn‚Äôt sure I would need it and 2 because if I did need it, would it actually pay. I‚Äôm very happy to say that they paid and the process from start to finish was super easy and I got my money in a few days. 

One of my return flights from Fresno to Phoenix was canceled which caused me to miss my connecting flight to El Paso on that Sunday night. I had to stay the night in Phoenix (which the airline paid for) so I missed a day of work and it was not a fun situation.  However, Allianz DEFINITELY came through and I will most definitely by buying insurance from now on! | The company makes it seem like you will get reimbursed if you missed your even no matter what..that was not the case..i missed my event due to work related issues and my claim was denied after they gave me the run around for a month..i wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app and the insurance policies | I have been purchasing travel insurance for years. As of beginning of 2023, this app stopped working. It no longer updates with new policies purchased through the airlines. 
I can find the policy via web, but when the app tries to update it throws an error and asks that we call Allianz. Defeats the purpose. | Worthless  Does not save information added?? | No complaints so far! | Took the info from our Viking travel plan, and entered it.

It used to be that my favourite feature would be to open the app, snap a receipt in seconds and have the basics recorded. Now it takes ages to load and even longer to take a picture and confirming the amount has become less intuitive. When I‚Äôm on a trip and recording dozens of receipts a week, I reckon this delay is costing me the equivalent of a full working day a year (compared to the previous versions). | This app makes life totally easier. With a snap of a picture, all my expenses are saved! Thanks SAP Concur for making my life so much easier!! | Scanning an Uber receipt? It shows up as a meal. The invoice says ‚ÄúPhoenix, Arizona‚Äù? Well glad the tool choose Hong Kong Dollar as the right currency‚Ä¶ honestly, the tool makes the most stupid mistakes and wrong scans.. it takes me forever to correct‚Ä¶ a other example? You correct the hotel itemization‚Ä¶ and just to mess with you the tool updates also the date of the entry‚Ä¶ 6 months back‚Ä¶ just because‚Ä¶ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to the change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and also grant me the patience to change the things again that I already changed once but the server failed to save.

‚Ä¶and also the wisdom to stop asking when the UI and function of Concur will feel like it crossed over Y2K. | The most godawful app in existence. Common bugs are never fixed. | If the new update from a few months ago was to make this app as inconvenient as possible, then it has been a success. | ÊúâÊó∂‰ºöÊ≠ªÊéâÔºåÂÖ∂ÂÆÉÈÉΩËøòÂ•Ω | Concur was my favorite app for years. It made my life so much easier.  The changes in the last couple of years have rendered it almost unusable.  The online app is even worse.  I went from bragging about Concur to avoiding using it. | Generally, this app is very good and works well to create and approve expense reports. An obvious feature that is missing is the ability to match/combine duplicate entries. I create expense entries with receipt's immediately, but the corresponding credit card charge is days later. The iOS app rarely matches these and the web app must be used. | PLEASE FIX. Buttons don‚Äôt load. App crashes. | A great way to expense stuff on the go, but I swear they‚Äôve never debugged this app once in it‚Äôs lifetime. Most of the time it takes multiple tries to get it to load, and sometimes it never works at all. Too frustrating to be worth it, would rather just do it on the computer and save the time | App is bugged. Keyboard will not pop up to allow typing, also cannot start new report, only see submitted reports. | Not working | It seems like every few months the app crashes, won‚Äôt allow receipt uploads, doesn‚Äôt work well across iPhone photos (doesn‚Äôt want to upload from photos to the app), losing reports, uploaded receipts after crashes causing double work. Frustrating, hope our company moves to a different platform. | Used to be easy. New update and this app is as fast as a snail. Brutal | The app is a nice idea, but it takes 10-20seconds for it to process each step (and there are 4 steps to enter each individual receipt). Needs to be quicker!!! It shouldn‚Äôt take more than 5 seconds to completely enter an expense and assign it to an expense report.

Glitchy and stalls a lot! 

This is not a good app! | But the app is garbage. Even after recently updating I can‚Äôt add images of receipts. It‚Äôs buggy and slow. All the time. It‚Äôs literally like 5 actions that need to be completed and this trash app can‚Äôt even do that. | Is exhausting. Why does it not work?  It did before you updated it. I still spend my life on authenticating and loading. It never loads and I restart a good five times and may work | Doesn‚Äôt load sometimes and I have to close it | Glitchy. Temperamental. | Why is the camera feature so difficult to use? It takes forever for the entire receipt to get in the frame or needs to be edited afterwards 

Impossible to use for anyone other then yourself; ie making arrangements or expenses for others. | It seems to me that those writing this program do not have to use it.  The last several updates have made the program so unfriendly to the end user. 
You guys can do better. | This is very frustrating. Concur app used to be pretty good and got the job done. Now there‚Äôs loading issues for expense reports even on fast network. I feel like the website is now more reliable than the mobile app now, that‚Äôs one sad state of affairs given that the website looks like it was made in the year 2000 | Where did the camera go on the first page to take a picture of a receipt? Are you trying to make the UX worse?! | I don‚Äôt write app reviews, but for 7 years of using this app for work on 6 different devices (3 Apple, 3 pixel), it has by far been the most frustrating app I‚Äôve ever encountered (this includes all of my kids apps). Times out 70% of the time I use it. Extremely slow..whether booking travel, logging expenses or even loading approvals for my direct reports. I loathe having to use it. | One star is very generous for this app. Easily the slowest and most difficult app I‚Äôve ever had to deal with. EVERY time I open it, it spins endlessly. I finally have to close it out and try again. It‚Äôs annoying. I‚Äôve tried updating it and same thing happens. | Latest update no good. Long authentication, took away features | Circles and circles. Won‚Äôt login on or update. | Overall, I like it for the expediency with my group, but every time I start one I have to tap around and tap around and then finally I figure out how to submit it | Two pay periods in a row I have not received reimbursement for what has been submitted and approved timely. If you‚Äôre not going to pay people what they are owed when they are supposed to receive it then you need to let them know in advance and not the day they expecting a direct deposit in their account. People have bills to pay and can‚Äôt wait days for their reimbursement to hit their accounts. Now on top of regular bills there are late fees added on because you didn‚Äôt do your part. | Best expense writing software! It‚Äôs so easy to use. I‚Äôm done with reports | Do it faster. | The sign in process for this app is horrible.  You have to delete and reinstall the app to sign in. | The app is slow to load and just a little faster when up loading a rec! I could go on but I have to receipts to upload and only an hour to do it. Lol | I will not use the app anymore because 5 flights have been cancelled when booked thru this app.   I usually get an email the weekend before the trip saying the airline had a problem forcing me to call them.   Now they get to up charge for the call in.   Yes.  I did get email confirmations.  Yes I did call the airline direct and never received the booking.   While he webpage has its issues I don‚Äôt trust this app at all. | On the mobile app when you get a credit on a hotel bill you can not proceed with the credit. There‚Äôs not minus on the key pad. So now I have to got to laptop and finish my report. Since the update it went missing. You add it back and you get a 5. | App is slow in loading expense detials | The set up process for two factor authentication is a absolute joke. The codes never come through and then it tells you to login for help but you can‚Äôt login because you can‚Äôt to factor authenticate. This is extremely frustrating and it‚Äôs the same way no matter whether you use the website or the app, no one wants to deal with this when you‚Äôre simply trying to travel on business. | To many steps to fill in attendees | Can‚Äôt tell UBER is a ‚Äúcar service/taxi‚Äù?
Every meal is ‚ÄúMultiple attendees‚Äù now? | It‚Äôs easy to access | Ever since the update this app has t loaded properly and the desktop version doesn‚Äôt book my flights half the time. | I‚Äôve dealt with this really bad program/app for years now, and forcing people to use a 2 factor identification is just another level of stupidity. What makes it worse is when the app doesn‚Äôt recognize it‚Äôs own code that it generated. I‚Äôm done with it, turning in company credit card and doing expenses on a spreadsheet is more attractive than this abortion of a program. | The app used to be awesome and work flawlessly. Now for the last 2 months, it‚Äôs clunky and glitchy. More often than not the app bricks out and I‚Äôm stuck with what looks to be developer programming mode when it should just be one of my regular expense reports. | It‚Äôll take 2-3 tries to open an existing expense report before it finally opens to add an expense. Sometimes I have to try multiple times just to get the expense report to turn from grey so I can open it. This app is really not great anymore, every since SAP took it over it went downhill. | App is super sloe | Slow, buggy and it‚Äôs AI proves SkyNet won‚Äôt take over. Clunky too. Needs a complete rebuild | The classic case of fixing something that wasn‚Äôt broken. You guys have tried to clean up the app and make it look more sleek and streamlined, but now things are harder to find and less intuitive. The app is capturing receipts from vendors, but then they can‚Äôt be used as a receipt. Makes no sense. Many redundancies in the fields that have to be populated. I used to love this app. It‚Äôs going the wrong direction. I‚Äôve used this app/software with multiple companies for many years, wish I could go back to previous versions. | Easy to use | Please stop sending my expense reports back to me for trivial items.";4.75786;994240;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/09/a4/18/09a41852-2419-72cb-1f8e-08c55eb72898/f8c3cde1-6f28-4e52-bd5b-00c726f2af2d_iPhone_5_5inch_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2d/4f/2c/2d4f2c69-7a78-4fcc-42bf-32727ebc4f74/e3402233-8db9-4f13-b824-6c9551f78a10_iPhone_5_5inch_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/18/fe/27/18fe27f9-2290-b3e6-7804-03d8ed589ba5/64f3740b-fb60-4a7e-b192-5e635ea0001a_iPhone_5_5inch_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1d/7d/45/1d7d4537-e19a-7c90-c353-0bd9053134b2/9bc83486-ff73-442a-93e4-8fd8695a336f_iPhone_5_5inch_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/01/da/70/01da705b-bfe6-b57a-433f-2de59af8609b/f2d1934d-5841-4d96-899a-09bc3a1b223a_iPhone_5_5inch_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a6/1b/9c/a61b9c00-c164-a429-acea-2c09477faa26/1f2442c0-bfb7-4073-aac4-3475e85cbb93_iPhone_5_5inch_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/70/e2/cb/70e2cbc1-8a68-553e-3cd2-b849a9605d95/34e54d16-651d-441c-83d7-70d3ae39fdf3_iPhone_5_5inch_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/50/ce/fa/50cefadc-dadb-bdf4-d9e8-c5458e5f1647/0560e8f1-f728-4e6d-b323-75d6f5400667_iPhone_5_5inch_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/52/6f/9d/526f9d7f-6e2e-333c-48be-95380bcb0a59/3d929655-6674-4354-a3bc-5350d9d8b68e_iPhone_5_5inch_9.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ea/33/6c/ea336cf5-2613-d2c1-bda7-ceb10522f946/3fb27281-f7a9-4f61-8ad6-6bce9fff8ee0_iPad_1.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/44/22/b8/4422b883-2af5-2ba4-7f48-dc4ba7d44521/d6d27c56-6da9-4d18-9cb4-580f65a61009_iPad_2.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/eb/2c/cd/eb2ccd94-fa71-3dd4-c194-13279c4c054d/60a79b99-c6c1-4550-b060-fb025caa5ad3_iPad_3.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bd/28/66/bd286603-d991-3af1-7ce5-d8f5aba9dd7e/23f804c4-eb4a-46ac-a771-45f002ee708b_iPad_4.png/552x414bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",

Never again!!! | I want to share my experience, my friend and I bought international tickets from this program, but unfortunately after 24 hours no one responded and they did not refund my money. Be very careful with this program so that you don't have any problems. I think there is no reliable company or person for this program ,,, | Excellent , I love it | It‚Äôs alway a pleasure booking with you all ‚ù§Ô∏è | I booked a flight through this app. But after few days got an email saying the airline has cancelled all its flights. Now the agent from OneTravel does not give any solutions on this. I can‚Äôt call to a USA number for reschedule from another country because of high price. Service from OneTravel is so bad. This seems like a scam to me. I lost my money. Avoid this scam app. | Phenomenal | Good | I was trying to flight back to the US from overseas after a few years of working. Decided to try this app. I books 6 months in advance with flexible additional charges in case something happened. Something happened and I tried removing someone from the flight. Horrible customer service. Used all the services to then cancel. After trying to cancel, it charged me the price of the one ticket that I was going to change. From 1200 to a 600 dollar refund. Bad luck. | Your representative who rang me was the most condescending and rude individual I‚Äôve ever dealt with | So, I was able to book an out of the country ticket and even purchased a travel insurance on the ticket just in case I was unable to make my flight. When I reached out to One Travel they told me that not only was I unable to cancel the ticket without penalty but that they would be charging me to make changes!!! Oh, it get better‚Ä¶. After an hour on the phone with them and getting charged a fee they told me that they were unable to make changes and that I would have to call the airlines myself!!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ oh and that‚Äôs not all‚Ä¶. When I reached the airline they booked me threw, in order to change the itinerary, it was literally for another full price ticket!!!üò§üò§üò§ So much for having a good rate on a flight!!! First and last time I will be using One travel to book a flight!!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! | If you love travel use one travel and stay at Sundancer Lombok Indonesia code word: DoggyDao üòé | As of Jan 2023, I cannot login into my account via this app. I enter in my email and password on the app but will not go beyond that once I click to sign in. I can view my account & upcoming flights just fine on my desktop, just cannot log into via this mobile phone app. | First time and I love it everything is fast and very easy to read. | My sit was wrong an I paid for it both flights | Every time the search results come up it‚Äôs for the wrong state, and or number of travelers. I always double check and confirm the information prior to submitting and I get the wrong results. Very annoying. | The online service is wonderful to use having been my first time to schedule this flight. | Solo falta que est√© en espa√±ol | I purchased a flight for one day i never recived confirmation and one day before the flight i found out it was book the wrong date so i lost my money and i coulbt get ahold of anybody big dissapoiment | Buena pagina para comprar | Nice apps | Their cancelation policy is 24hrs after booking, tried to chat with an agent and he said it was airline policy which is not very true since my flight is months away and if i booked through their website directly they would have let me cancel. I guess i wont be making that mistake again. I also had a hard time even finding my itinerary on the app and website, it would say i had no upcoming trips, and it would just direct me to covid 19 page. Wont be using again | I called yesterday and today and both time i was talking with the agent for over 60 minutes and at the end the result was 0 zero. The did not helped me in any way. They just want to take your money and nothing else. For anything you call they will charge using different names. | Wow - got a fantastic deal on the dates I wanted to travel and it included travel insurance for a tiny fee.  Am so chuffed to finally be able to get on a plane again and go see friends!
Thanks for great service!!! | Don‚Äôt ever buy your tickets with onetravel. I bought my tickets in 2020 and due to COVID-19 they didn‚Äôt refund my money. In 2021 i bought two more tickets in USA and due to a bad weather in Denver , they didn‚Äôt refund and they didn‚Äôt even inform me about the cancellation. What an unprofessional business. Never ever in my life by tickets with you guys. You are the worst company i ever work with.  Very unprofessional,  if i could get a -1 minus stars i would give it to you. | Great app I‚Äôve been using it for years | I booked this before Covid spread as bad as it is and they won‚Äôt refund or allow for a future flight. I‚Äôll not use this again. | Tkyuo üòå | I have traveled all over the world using this agency and they have never done me wrong . Love you travel one !!! | Booked but the site changed my airport called right away was told there would not be a charge to correct had to fight hours on phone to get a billing and I was charged the change fee. Now have to wait for some supervisor to call flight time changed 2 weeks after booking not the time I would have booked hours to get answered from people who drop the call and you can barely hear or understand.  Run.  I really mean it run away from this site go to the airline directly. This one is terrible!!! Run! | This is the worst booking site. They didn‚Äôt even ask for passage information nor did they ask to confirm the information. When I called the number they had down to call for help changing name on flight the person said I can‚Äôt change any information because it was a super saver ticket. Why would that even matter. Don‚Äôt deal with OneTravel they scam you. | Ca | Round trip flight to LA for AORN conference which was canceled due to Covid 19 still have not received refund | I was unaware that they were going to have to verify my flight by calling my bank before I got my tickets and the guy hung up in the middle of the call and I am unable to get ahold of anyone and I am sitting at the airport with no tickets | You guys are inconsiderate I | I tried for week to chat talk email about my modification to my flight on March 26th. No response from anyone. Very frustrated now would like a reply. Been on hold for 3 hrs time. Please assist me needs. sincerely Daniel Lee Huber Silver status Booking number 67424375... | Great Prices! Thanks | I booked a reservation through what I thought was the airline. It was travelone. Now because of the corona virus, it is necessary to not make the trip. No phones are answered. No help. | Great app | Must say the two flights i booked went fine but the dang app will NOT go away! Every time I open yahoo the app comes up . I have deleted several times it but that doesn‚Äôt work. How the heck do i get it to GO AWAY!!? | üòé | Booking was super easy, and convenient | I booked through what I thought was the airline.  Ended up with Travel One/Cheap airfare.  Conversation very difficult.  Then once cancelled I received an email that said cancellation was not complete until a final step with ‚Äúotp-onetime password‚Äù was made. Through the app, I chatted with someone who said they could see it was cancelled by my confirmation #.  I questioned was the additional step with otp not needed as suggested by their email.  They then asked what the # was  so to update.  I gave it to them and then was asked if I needed anything else?  I feel if I had just taken their word and not questioned the need for the ‚Äúotp‚Äù. They would have in fact not cancelled My rez and by the time I realized this would have been told a ridiculous cancellation fee.  Long story short- felt very scam like! Always deal directly with airline/hotel | Idk but this site must have a small business owner. To verify your account they call you and say what‚Äôs the phone number to account then proceed to say ok we have to call you back at this number to verify payment please  answer. Then they call back as if everything is verified whole time no receipt still & no money has been taken out account. Next morning I get an email saying your flight amount has changed. Fort Lauderdale flight went from $115 one way to $485. Lolll I canceled of course total b.s and a waste of time now I have to keep eye on my card because the whole process was just weird to me . DONT USE READ FINE PRINT!!!! | All details are vague and I‚Äôm pretty sure I was bumped down, but I have no way to prove it | I wanted to use my Paypal account to purchase a ticket on short notice. It worked out perfectly. | Not very good customer service. My ticket was so messed up the woman told me to call United. I should have just called them in the first place. Never again will I use this service. | 65140946 booking reference I‚Äôm really unhappy with the way your agency refused to help me out when my son reached the airport 2pm for the 2:55 flight to USA. 

The airlines counter did not take him for the flight, and then refused to rebook him on the next flight and when I called your agent she told me to pay additional 800/- or so to book for the next day.  Now you say I‚Äôve lost the return flight also....this is seriously ridiculous and just trying to rob people of their hard earned money.......

I WILL NOT BOOK WITH ONE TRAVEL ANYMORE I HAVE LEARNT MY LESSON NEVER TO TRUST YOUR AGENCY AGAIN. | Lowest price of air ticket for Minneapolis MN-Phoenix AZ round trip.
I recommend oneTravel, all US cities prices-oneTravel is recommendable | I love how easy it is to arrange for my travels with the itinerary I want and everything else.  Thank you. | They slipped me an alternate return date...  now can not reach any service!

The app just spins until it times out. I‚Äôm able to see availability for that day but I cannot complete the reservation. I‚Äôve tested with other restaurants and I have the same issue. Bummer. | Open table has always been a  simple to use, stable app, which for a number of years has reliably delivered accurate reservations for me. | App doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Support couldn‚Äôt help me. 
I was told to use their website. 
Website isn‚Äôt helpful when on the go. | Let‚Äôs start with a Marker for the address requested.  

Wasted 5 mins mapping restaurants to where IÔ∏è needed it located. | Pork Chop Friday is always a winner. Excellent, courteous service and outstanding meals. Our group has been getting together there several times a year for quite some time and it‚Äôs always tremendous. | Love ease of making a reservation. | Somehow got wrong date on reservation. I only found out because I was trying to move the time from 6 to 630. So I had to go back and that was problematic. Half an hour to make half an hour change | Easy and fast | What a pain to sign in. Have used the app for years - no issues. Now, all sorts of hurdles to sign in, and it took four attempts! I know my user name and password. | My phone does not have email so hard to prove who I  via email. Why is once via text not sufficient? | Great food excellent service | The app is slow and non responsive. Frustrating to use. | Maybe I‚Äôm one of those people who would NEVER  bail/no show on a restaurant reservation, nor would I ever cancel a reservation without ample warning. 
But I am truly tired of so many restaurants now requiring a credit card to hold a reservation  especially when they charge a portion per headcount ahead of time. It makes me not want to go to those restaurants anymore just to make a point. | 4 people my wife me my son and my grandchild saying goodbye to them on a trip to Portugal | Day of reservation. So easy to find availability. Understanding that only outside availability. Loved knowing I secured a reservation and where I‚Äôm sitting | Fast booking reservations. I love how simple the set up is and how easy it is to check available tables! | Great service. | We had an early reservation before 7 PM theater tickets and were invited to join friends who arrived just before us.

Our server, Annette, was outstanding.

She ascertained that we wanted to be on our way by 6:30, was helpful with ordering, got the bar recipe for an Old Fashioned for our friend, and dinner timing was perfect.

All of our experience at Corinne was pleasant and greatly enhanced by Annette‚Äôs expertise. | Everything was fantastic and the wait staff was very attentive.  Highly recommend for a personal or business lunch/dinner. | This is our favorite dining app! We never use any other app for our dining needs. Open table is always spot on with the reviews I read on each restaurant. Open table is dependable and it‚Äôs super easy to use! I wish more restaurants would get on board because they would be at full capacity. It‚Äôs a pain to wait until 4pm or 5pm to call a restaurant to make a reservation and they say there is nothing available. It would be nice to see their availability on Open Table. We only reserve from Open Table. Thanks for the consistency! | Locked me out of reserving due to restaurants not marking us as being there. That is unfair to us customers. | Nonsense to have to put a cc down for a reservation. | I tried numerous times to make a reservation using the App.  I have been on Open Table since the beginning and use it all the time.  Unfortunately, you kept trying to verify who I was and sending me confirmation numbers and your system continue to NOT recognize me.  Finally, I gave up and started a new reservation and it finally worked. | 5 stars that is but I wish all restaurants used open table. I get they pay for it for I  am sure they loose covers by not having it | Oh so easy! | This was my second time visiting this establishment since about one year ago. The first time I had a good experience, food was good, service also. We decided to visit it again although I had to press my husband who was reluctant to go.  Service was good, our waitress was pleasant and attentive. 
We started with mariquitas and guacamole. The guacamole was excellent, the  mariquitas were from a bag!  I ordered the tamal en cazuela.  It was very mediocre and it was more chunks of pork than tamal. My husband ordered a kale salad with churrasco, it was horrible! The meat was very low quality full of tendons. 
I enjoy watching Mika execute her recipes on Instagram very much but her restaurant was very disappointing. 
We were there on Sunday at around 2 pm and it was only us and two other couples and to top it off it was not very reasonable as far as prices. We don‚Äôt mind paying as long as the food is worth it. 
Overall a very mediocre meal. I hope she concentrates more in bettering her restaurant. We need good Cuban restaurants in Miami. | Amazing food, service and experience! Waiter was top notch and management was good too. Very attentive and friendly! Highly recommended! | What a great app! So simple to use | I've used open table for 10 years. Since the change to ""passwordless"" I can't sign in. 

Customer support has been discontinued. 

Their ""help"" chatbot says that the only reason login codes won't work is when an account is deactivated for missed reservations. I never missed or cancelled a reservation and have no emails from Open Table about missed or cancelled reservations.

The only step offered after this is completing a web form that sends no acknowledgement and results in no contact from them, or access to my account. | The App is functionally inop for the past several days. Takes up to 5 minutes to load, if it doesn‚Äôt lock up and flash a ‚Äúsorry‚Äù banner. What‚Äôs going on‚Äîis this going to be fixed? | Many opposition to choose from, so hold on to your cell phone! A few places do NOT offer ENOUGH photosüò≠, but sharing the vibes with a awesome point system will drive you to use this app againüôèüèæ | Doug is the best. Accommodated special requests on several occasions.The  Music is meditative. | My account is glitching. Sometimes I can book reservations and other times I cannot I have contacted them through an AI chat box with no resolve. | Availability for reservations should show up front if only outdoor seating is available. | Keep up the good work see Monday 11 so easy to book
Tom | We had a great time at Eddie V‚Äôs. Thank you ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù the manager for being so kind to us I hope I got her name right forgive me if I made a mistake.
They remembered my Birthday, and I appreciated the personalized card, nice touch. But the meal, was truly incredible! Fresh oysters, new to the menu, set the bar high for excellence tonight. The filet was delectable, as was the special morel encrusted lamb offering. Coupled to perfectly with caviar, smoked old fashioneds, hope diamond martinis & delicious Cabernet all delivered by a wonderfully effervescent ‚ÄúCarly!‚Äùthis made our night superlatively special. Five stars Carly & yes we went right home & got into our snuggly cloths & jumped into bed! Highest marks until next time, when we will bring family. | LOVE the ease of this app! Perfectly reliable and never wasted my time. Handles all the leg work of booking a table-Thanks, Open Table! | Too much work to sign in | I feel like the algorithm for personalized options could be better. I like the app but I feel like it doesn‚Äôt meet my character with its recommendations | Open Table is quick and easy to use 24 hours a day. | Enjoy open table and restaurants | It ok | Its so easy and convenient! 
No issues whatsoever. | Turkey bagel snake | App claims I have an account, when I try to verify I continuously get error messages | Too many authentications required to make a reservation. Quite frustrating. | So easy to use I love this app! Best part is that it automatically adds your reservation to your calendar.

No option given at time of making reservation for toll pass, no offer or reminder to get one when picking up rental. Tried calling customer service 3 times only to be hung up on repeatedly or no one answering. Tried modifying through hertz.com only to be told there was a page error 3/3 attempts. Trying to add a driver and get toll pass for rest of the week and I‚Äôm only 1 hr into my rental with no apparent options. Extremely dissatisfied with hertz.  Would appreciate an actual phone call to me at 978-836-7571 to get this rectified. Thank you, Tammy Belanger. | This app doesn‚Äôt work but neither does the website nor frankly, the service. Unable to make simple changes to profile and update contact information. Not able to request receipts. And if booked thru the site prices change when you pick up the vehicle. And when you request help the site crashes or sends you into an endless loop. | I have spent three hours online or on Hertz lame phone system for gold members.  terrible! | Not user friendly, unable to change account information and doesn‚Äôt allow all the options that website/ desktop offers. | Hertz works tries to make their rewards program sound appealing, but they put so many restrictions, the points are all but useless.  For example, you cannot rent a car for 7 days, pay for five with cash and then pay for two days with points.  Many locations don‚Äôt accept points.  Or they limit you to a one day points rental.  I‚Äôve been a gold member for 20+ years.  I‚Äôm tired of being treated so poorly.  I‚Äôll take my business elsewhere. | The Moment I got to ATL hertz location that had my car and they gave me a upgrade when I got back they filled up my car for free! I recommend using hertz | Just the worst customer service of all Companies | How am I supposed to rent the gold member section like I used to before Covid. What setting am I supposed to go with. | I had to enter my information on the site three times before if finally registered. Also, I wasn‚Äôt able to find the pay now rate on the app and had to reserve through the website. Not very well coordinated. | The ‚Äúforgot id‚Äù and ‚Äúforgot password‚Äù links just lead to error messages, and you‚Äôre unable to reset anything. | Love it‚Äôs easy pickup | I am a gold gold member and I had a reservation

Arrived and there are no cars and a lot of people waiting for cars

There‚Äôs a lot of options to choose from to rent cars

Don‚Äôt go with Hertz at Las Vegas | I‚Äôve never been able to use the app for the ‚Äútouchless rental experience‚Äù they advertise. Can‚Äôt log in half the time. Absolutely terrible app | Discounts very confusing. Say you can pick any car in presidential but don‚Äôt list them or categories. Should be honest and straightforward | Apple Pay tries to be the primary way of paying. | Looking at renting a car for Vegas. The cost on the app was $200 more than what the company website was. Do homework before renting | I‚Äôve tried calling and they keep hanging up before I can get to a person. So I downloaded the app. The app has no way to speak with customer service. I tried chatting outside the app and the response says not in service at this time. No mire Hertz for us. | App is unhelpful‚Äîcannot login and retrieve my reservation from Concur. The goal for downloading the app is for convenience, and it is not at all helpful for that. | It‚Äôs a wow experience as always. Highly recommended | Not so much the app, maybe bad data, but the initial price quote per week is no where near what the final per week cost is at check out so you have to start over. Make them match accurately!!! | Please stop pushing electric vehicles, add ons for ins and stuff and use of Apple Pay | Tried this app and website version and it just keeps spinning. Tried different devices , phones, desktops, dates etc. terrible and the developers need to fix it! | The rental reservation process is hard to follow and understand | App has never once worked. Have not been able to login to my account outside of using the website and constantly resetting my password. Was hoping to use Hertz since President Circle included with my Delta status but it‚Äôs such an unseeded headache. Will continue renting with Avis and their easy to access app | Very bad customer service!!! | All I want is to speak to a representative because the situation I have is not listed anywhere. Horrible experience | I must use the app | This app has a lot of problems. Please fix them, Hertz. I‚Äôm a President‚Äôs Club member and wouldn‚Äôt think of using the app again. | This is a great app | Very Professional Team | Presidents circle and still waiting in a 30 minute line? | I have been a hertz member for years. Their tech really struggles. | It requires 2 factor authentication every time you open the app and I can‚Äôt change it in the settings.  When I used it for a rental , it kept erroring out.  Ended up standing in a long line anyways.  lol.  What‚Äôs the point of having this app. | I‚Äôve been renting a car from Hertz many times in different states and the comment thing between all the employers that they are so rude why I don‚Äôt know even through the phone they don‚Äôt respect you when you ask them or when you try to explain to them is that the policy of the company ?! | See app fails constantly | I love the deals and service | I am just trying to check in for my rental .. so far the online portal is a total failure worse I have probably ever used.  The app cannot do it because of an error and waiting 15 mins on the phone CS can‚Äôt do it either | It took me about 5 minutes to get my reservation entered and pay. | App is great, book a car with ease!! | Hassle free, great pricing and benefits. | I‚Äôm a gold plus rewards member. For some reason I was having trouble updating my card information on the website. Downloaded the app‚Ä¶signed in & made the changes immediately & confirmed my rental! | A 25 dollar$ fee for battery level is unreal. Especially after purchasing the highest tier of insurance. | I don‚Äôt know if it was one of the numerous updates but the app is terrible now. It doesn‚Äôt show the AAA discount prices it used to. There is a promotion going on. Ive tried since sometime in January to book a reservation. Some of the points I had last year are gone. I used 1 free day only. I called Hertz before December 2023 ended to make sure ALL my points rollover, was told yes but they didn‚Äôt. So he lied. It‚Äôs too bad. Love the people at the Hertz in Tempe AZ, they‚Äôve always been friendly and helpful. I‚Äôm just not sure about how corporate runs f they can‚Äôt get things straight. | Sorry this is usually the only way to get you guys to fix the app. Currently the 23Feb2024 app update has caused the app to get stuck in ‚Äúimprove your trip‚Äù page and will not continue beyond. | I can‚Äôt even access entry to the app to be able to check my Hertz reservation. I‚Äôve been using Hertz for years, but this app will not let me utilize it. | Tried to take advantage of AAA offer from email and was unable to process!!?? Very disappointed!!!!
Used Hertz application & would not allow me to use my points towards 2 free days!!!???
Whole experience I feel was a complete scam!!!
Tried to use chat and had no success with 
Representative resolving my issues!!!! | I was charged two extra hours which is impossible when I was on a flight. I was charged two gallons of fuel which I have receipts for my expenses which the latest one was close to the airport and I did not ask for Siri radio when I have iTunes using blue tooth. | I have rented exclusively from Hertz fo the better part of 10 years. This app is terribly built. I dare you to try and find your current rental on the app without having the confirmation number. Logic tells me that if I am still using the rental that I should find it immediately on the app under ‚Äúmy rentals‚Äù. It‚Äôs obviously not under ‚Äúupcoming rentals‚Äù because I‚Äôm currently using it. Got to fix this!! The rental history is never accurate. | Not user friendly at all. Clunky, not an easy flow through the process and not easy to ‚Äúgo back‚Äù to fix something.

You have to delete the entire route and start again. | I love the game and the way it is. Is amazing | I would give this app 5 stars, however it is missing two KEY FEATURES.

	1. Desperately needs LANDSCAPE view added.  The app only allows portrait mode, so if you are using a iPad on a keyboard you are up the creek with no paddle. 

	2. Please add trip destination list.  Currently you add a destination then must add a new destination.  The old destination becomes a waypoint along your journey.  This is ok until you want to add text or edit the route.

If these two features were added I am advocate until then no. | This app will fail immediately when you get it. I should clarify: it will let you build out a whole year of travel and then if you want to see it animate, it will crash each time you click to play or view it. Worried about it and want to save it just in case before you troubleshoot the horrible app? Too bad, saving a single route will cost you $29.99 - no joke. Stay away. | First when you download this app you have too write the place you 
Want to go. But please let us just look on the map and choose please. And you get a dame tutorial and please you have to buy a vehicle and you have real money.

Like I said Don‚Äôt Download This App. | When I tried it, it took way longer than I thought it would. It would be a 5 star if it didn't take a lot of time. | ITS TOO GOOD | Es incre√≠ble y puedo saber los viajes | App not working fix it | It just glitched when I‚Äôm making a car going every thing from Denmark to Denmark | Highly recommend | Quick and easy, love the app | Such a cool idea for this app.  But when I try to use it on my iPad it only operates in Portrait mode.  I‚Äôd venture to say the majority of iPad users ‚Äúwork‚Äù on their iPads in Landscape.  Can‚Äôt you make this orient properly based on the device and orientation of the device? | I love this group well really a dark mode | Gud | Aplicaci√≥n muy divertida para dibujar recorridos !!! | Route management is awful: no clue which route you‚Äôre exiting, if it‚Äôs saved etc. 

No undoing you accidentally double tap instead of press and hold. | I love this app thank you! | This is VERY GOOD with Border, Even better than Mapchart, Even the Mongol Empire Makes ALOT MORE Sence because on Mapchart it has sharp ends, but I like it when it has soft ends, and it makes it look a lot more like Mongol Empire! | This is the BEST app ever for mac, Especially if you have the premium. 5 Stars. Period. No Excuses. | It‚Äôs simple but something as easy as touching a line might mess up the map. So then you have to take time to delete the stuff every time you accidentally create a pin. Also i have a hard time changing the icon if I go over the same destination twice. After restarting 3 times, I just gave up because it ended up looking messy. Frustrating to try to use overall. It makes more sense to me that instead of being able to add a location just by accidentally touching the line, there should be a plus symbol if someone wants to adjust the line (along with the regular one at the top right). | Can't get past the tutorial screen | Hi I like this game but there are problems that I frustrated .So when making routes there are random routes just popping up that is not supposed to be like that and I worked hard on those routes to make videos but I had to delete a lot and none of them were successful and I cannot post them because the routes and tangled and messed up Please fix it. I‚Äôm gonna leave one star review if this keeps happening. Thank you. | This is good for making TikToks and yt shorts | Necesita otra figura de mu√±ecos mam√° -pap√° -hijo - hija

Mam√° con dos hijos 

  Gracias | This will be good to travel to new places stay excited! | I see it on tik tok and yt shorts and it looks like amazing content. I wish the could make it easier for boarders and stuff but other than that it is pretty good! 

Smiley face of appreciation :) | Hi | I love geography so much and when I discovered this app I sharted my pants IM ACTUALLY GOING INSANE I LOVE THIS SO MUCH IM ACTUALLY GOING TO BASH MY SKULL INTO CONCRETE AND SCOOP MY EYES OUT WITH SPOONS | It claims to give you a free download of your video if you watch an ad and after your 30 seconds ad it does not close out but rather only lets you download another app and you have to retry hence watching another ad and it cycles again. | This game is SO fun. I make good content with tysm | I can make empires with this helpful and playful game!! It‚Äôs so fun | Good app | this is so fun i can make my own videos qnd stuff it is amazing!!! | after a while of making stops at different places a bunch of the yellow lines start appearing and everything just glitches i‚Äôve tried many things but it won‚Äôt work | Lul | I don‚Äôt wanna make anyone sad :C | People made videos with this | Hi! I love this app and use it all the time. I just updated to the new version and it looks like the old default map has changed and also it doesn‚Äôt animate the same. Wondering how I can step back to the previous version? I really loved the way it animated before and the old map.

It‚Äôs a shame because I‚Äôd love to use the more advanced options if they were more reasonably priced. | This is a great app but noticed a few bugs. When city hopping to relatively nearby cities, the route doesn‚Äôt mark these to the appearance is that the plane is just flying over the city. I hacked this by changing the color of the plane for each stop. Also, my stop in London didn‚Äôt give me a Union Jack flag.

Sorry but I‚Äôm going to have to delete it. | I‚Äôve tried four or five times to use this app but the lack of clarity and proliferation of bugs makes it completely useless. When I want to add a location, half of the time I either get the ‚Äòmake two locations since these photos are so far apart!‚Äô message, or when I search something, I get a blank screen (no location found). This app has great potential but I loathe how problematic it is. | When I try to create a login, it asks for 5 interests, but none shows up, and the spinning thingy in the middle of the screen keeps spinning. | Excellent app! But will there be iPad support any time soon? | It s an awsome app... the one who loving trips they can choose this. Very beautiful | Been waiting for something like this, love the app, UI and design, it‚Äôs beyond perfect. | Very basic, nothing new | The app is awesome! It‚Äôs easy for travelers and explorers to browse through new travel locations. The design is very clean and easy to use. I can‚Äôt wait to start uploading my own locations for others to enjoy. 

Keep it up guys! Excited for the community to grow. | I really liked the idea of this app. And then I quickly realized the currency is in euro. I would have liked to see numbers that reflected American measurements and currency. It didn‚Äôt appear to be something you could change in the settings, either. I‚Äôll change my rating if I‚Äôm wrong. | Little information and a no possibility to create a trip plan. Essentially random pictures and random locations. Disappointing. | Really simple design, high quality content. Very helpful in terms of travel information. Awesome!! | I have binged on this A+ app for hours to see which interesting spots other people went to. It gave me a lot of travel ideas and showed me places that I have never thought of.

Guess I‚Äòm going to plan my next travel on Mapify and hopefully explore some of the places myself... 
 
Definitely recommend checking this app out!!! | Traveling can be such a hassle if the right plan is not in place. Mapify has revolutionized how I want to travel. Starting with locations that might best fit for me... I can have a whole trip planned in one-go. Truly fantastic! | Love the app! Super easy to use! | As a travel photographer, I'm very impressed | Being a traveling photographer and filmmaker I couldn‚Äôt be more excited about this app. Super easy to share your travel experiences and see places you want to visit submitted by others! If you‚Äôre the kind of traveler who wants to find those hidden gem spots this is the place to find them. I think once this app grows it will be a great community ambitious adventures who share their passion for travel just as much as I do!! | I‚Äôm blown away by the high quality content on Mapify!";3.93103;87;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/f6/c8/6c/f6c86c03-627e-d53c-f985-010cbfeebce7/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/72/e2/02/72e2020e-d7fb-2334-01d0-780b17300ca1/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/34/94/3d/34943d87-c44d-ab51-60b5-90df06025618/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/01/44/a9/0144a9e1-281f-fc95-c782-19c70da6a01c/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/ac/d1/92/acd1921f-a107-ee1c-93b5-de3e0ee837cd/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ff/87/44/ff8744e3-93ac-6e83-c5ed-068d13007ea7/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ad/86/ab/ad86ab81-8962-6f58-6596-689bf22d2be3/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/f0/5c/03/f05c03f6-2a80-352f-572e-e105eb2311ad/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]";"[]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

No more circling the airport real time take off and landings!! | Best app | Reassurance re flight times depart and arrival | Very helpful when I p/u family member from SNA | Con esta aplicaci√≥n no pierdo tiempo esperando en el aeropuerto porque s√© exactamente cuando salen y cuando llegan los vuelos, si est√° atrasado y por cu√°nto tiempo, mejor imposible. | Is getting less useful all the time. I use this app to track arriving flights for people I‚Äôm going to meet at the airport. But needless notifications days in advance are nothing but an annoyance.  Ads run each time after a flight is added to be tracked, which is fine and assumed on the free version. The problem comes when the ads  are obvious scams. And lately, the ads have been so long that you have to just shut the app down and reopen it if you want to continue. | Flight Tracker is very precise in tracking all flights including their departures, enroute and arrivals | Like this app. It‚Äôs got everything I want with flight schedules and radar views | The last few flights I tracked this app was way off & take off & landing times. As I write this my daughter is sitting on the ru way at Tampa 14th in line to take off. App says it took off 45 min ago. FIX THIS PLZ! | I found my flight in under 10 minutes | I just can‚Äôt make it work for Ethiopian airlines specially the local ones it doesn‚Äôt track it at all | Love how it keeps us updated and the small details such as baggage claim numbers | Even though I had to pay for no ads and live tracking, it is very accurate! I'm going to Vegas and I had a layover. I put my flight number and it was 100% accurate. Best flight tracker I've ever used! | I do not like this app and want to cancel it. 
Thank you | Tech support was very responsive, and corrected the issues in a timely manner. Flights are easy to search, and display the correct dates. Departure and Arrival times appear to be updated quickly and accurately. I‚Äôm very satisfied with this app! ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî I subscribe to the Pro version of this app, which used to work well. As of at least yesterday, 1/21/2024, every search for an an Alaska Airlines flight results in ‚ÄúNo Flights Found.‚Äù I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, with no change. Like much of the nation, we‚Äôre under very nasty weather conditions, so I was hoping this app would keep me advised of flight status. Time to look elsewhere. | Flight Tracker is a wonderful app and I use it all the time for business and personal travel. 

However, before the app will ADD a flight to my calendar, it wants full access to my calendar. A flight app should be able to add a flight to a calendar without full access to my private, daily schedule. I should be able to select the option, ‚Äúadd events only‚Äù without impacting my privacy. Thank you. | Super | I love this application | I‚Äôve never written a negative review. I‚Äôm of the opinion if you don‚Äôt like something don‚Äôt use it an move on. This app pushed me to my breaking point. 
I‚Äôve used this app for several years. Loved the ease of use and accuracy. However, since I don‚Äôt travel a ton the only paid option at 50.00/year doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. The ads last about a minute each and you need to watch one or two between adding any new information. This is particularly aggravating while your literally at an airport and trying to get information quickly. Sadly, I‚Äôm going to search for a new app as it‚Äôs become incredibly frustrating and unfun to use. | Have used this app for many years. The new version is horrible. I finally deleted it; it is useless to me. | I just paid for real-time tracking. It told me the flight had already taken off and showed the plane over the water on the map. Then I got a text from our son saying they were still in the runway and there was a maintenance issue. 
Really misleading and dishonest app. | Within five minutes my screen was taken over with a full page ad to ‚Äòfree up space‚Äô ‚Ä¶ and I could not figure out how to get rid of it. No ‚Äòx‚Äô to hit. Only an opportunity to free up space. So I got out and deleted the app. | Flight Tracker reported that my sons plane left on time at 12:45. It‚Äôs 2:50 and plane is still at gate delayed over 2 hrs. So much for updates. | No flights are shown after the last update two years ago. Before this update the app sas üëçüëçüëçüëç. So please fix the issue please. | App stopped tracking flights two days ago. Getting little help from customer service. Was using paid app version. Very frustrating. | Amazing app helps tracking and getting stuff together also you know what time everything is | Very useful app highly recommended | Stop showing flights | Interface is far worse than Flightaware. No ability to find where your jet is currently. Dumped it | Flight Tracker is amazing and so accurate!! | When you only fly once or twice a year and annoying. | Everything gets monetized.
Gone from my apps. | I've been using the Flight Tracker app for years now, and it's been great. It's reliable, easy to use, and has some really useful features. The TripIt integration is a game changer. Overall, I have no complaints ‚Äì this is a must-have for those who fly a lot. | I never seen any of us before and now I have now because you‚Äôre tracking were so good that I literally just saw an airbus A380 and it was so cool and huge. Your tracking told me where it was and where it was located. | This application is not compatible with the new iPhone. The middle screen freezes and doesn‚Äôt go away until you uninstall. | NOBLESVILLE Indianapolis | This one is the only flight tracker that doesn‚Äôt glitch or is behind in anyway. My favorite thing is the map of each airport! Such a useful tool. If I could make a recommendation for a better app then I would have to say that if they included the map of where the baggage will be, how to get there from the arrival location and a map of where the terminal is or where the location is after baggage claim, then I will have to pay for the premium account definitely. Otherwise, the price for premium doesn‚Äôt seem worth it since the free version has everything I needed. Also, I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because the app kills my battery if I forget to close it so they should probably make it force close upon exit to fix that, the flight will still be in the recent section for easy access. | Would not recommend this app.! | I had used the app in the past and liked it. But without paying for a premium membership it‚Äôs barely useable now. Way too many ads now. | This app drained 61% of my battery within 8mins of on-screen activity. Either badly programmed or they‚Äôre scrapping data. | Constantly pops up ads and games and links to other flight tracking apps.  Provides limited useful information above what airline status app provides. | Good | The ability to track departing flights without destination has been removed.  This was the ONLY app available to do so.  Please fix this!!! | Bastante bueno , genial y f√°cil de usar ! | Thanks for providing the service. | Easy to use and very informational for Flight Tracking.   Sharing used to be well formatted emails family & friends could read, but the latest update to share flight is severely lacking and forces others to use the app.  If they revert back to previous functionality, would rate this a 5-Star | You need to buy the subscription to use it. | Fklfkckfkc | It‚Äôs so fun looking at all the other planes and learning about other planes | Love the app for what I use it for (looking at flights around me) so much so that I wish I could add a Flight Tracker widget to my Home Screen! Please consider adding widget functionality!";4.71386;244145;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/94/2a/cf/942acfa5-930c-4c7c-05fd-894c65ca805b/207ff306-6268-4f31-b543-e7936b5302d7_iPhone_8_Plus_-_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/cb/76/2b/cb762b88-3039-b454-5ed4-47fa768d44f9/28dd1a1a-c39e-4656-b41a-f1dbdf97c91d_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/17/e2/29/17e229b5-c435-923d-7268-041c2ed7f5a9/d1713188-983f-4d7f-9cb7-8d11bec6fc8c_iPhone_8_Plus_-_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/2d/8d/d2/2d8dd26f-90ff-edf5-65d7-df8575acd6dd/e9adb643-1f94-4d26-8a8a-8486cdcfc01b_iPhone_8_Plus_-_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/03/c9/c5/03c9c5bb-0a2e-f3a0-177f-937fa589f33f/9616b0d2-f709-4050-b619-07358f227688_iPhone_8_Plus_-_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/db/f3/f4/dbf3f40f-9f58-4768-eaf9-6387b503358a/1b7a3fd2-f6f3-4b86-881d-5ebaca43ab12_iPhone_8_Plus_-_6.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/ac/17/87/ac17872f-162d-3642-23ab-9e2d38187783/07f3c5a9-f9bd-41da-b640-672c035cb298_iPad_Pro_12.9__-_7.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/c7/90/8c/c7908c7c-1c63-fbf8-5270-0f393b825b12/83eeec20-2856-4f7b-a729-0411b9081e20_iPad_Pro_12.9__-_8.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/87/d7/17/87d717b4-bc98-6c11-25e4-c8b0b322b0ef/cb674249-9c25-4564-a1ec-5e5697bd3700_iPad_Pro_12.9__-_9.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/34/d4/e3/34d4e3c0-1fe0-113c-4473-8b92e956144c/e976f3e9-08cb-4446-8c5a-69154ecdf2d5_iPad_Pro_12.9__-_10.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/88/c6/61/88c66170-af79-7112-92af-4d536aa5ec88/ca1c97c5-74a9-426d-8830-0e89768c7ff3_iPad_Pro_12.9__-_11.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/21/b1/ac/21b1ac0d-0b05-7354-062f-b8223ad0e886/4143b848-0674-434c-ab22-d3aa0e9f1777_iPad_Pro_12.9__-_12.png/576x768bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellul

I‚Äôm trying to compare to Tripcoin and the first thing I do is go to enter my first receipt and you have to pay. You would be smart to allow full access for a few days. | I understand not being able to edit more than one trip at a time, but it won‚Äôt even tell you how much you spent on prior trips unless you have premium - it just deletes the data.

Made it pretty unusable for a multi country SE asia trip unless you edit it to all be one trip, and then the data is totally muddled and useless. | Thank you for all the work on this app. I love it! This is exactly what I was looking for. The ability to track all the expenses of a trip from valet tips to coffee to hotels. It works for driving or flying. I cannot say it enough, I love it. | easy to mange and cute emoticons really like that it calculates a lot of stuff for you! | Love this app - I‚Äôve always wanted to track our Trip expenses but somehow after several days the notebook loses its luster - but this works! Thanks for this easy and user friendly solution! | During our planning for a 3 month European adventure we realized that we would need to find a way to record expenses during the trip. We looked in the App Store and came across this App. We downloaded it and immediately started recording the expenses that we had already incurred. We then started recording those expenses that we had not yet incurred but planned (reservations). It was then, on the first day, we realized we had found that tool. We immediately upgraded to the premium lifetime version. 

That was over 3 months ago. We have returned from that trip. Every day, wherever we were, we EASILY entered every transaction creating thorough and comprehensive history of expenses. After we returned we exported the data into a spreadsheet, formatted the data and proceeded to reconcile all our credit card accounts as well as enter the data in Quicken (our household finance management tool). A task that we originally dreaded. The process while not easy was absolutely made easier with the use of this App. During the process, we were able to go back into the App and confirm receipts that we could not even remember what they were by piecing together info we easily recorded in real time months before. The App‚Äôs functionalities to convert multiple currencies and geo locate transactions are invaluable! 

We are pleased that we have a lifetime subscription since we will never travel with out it. Actually, we are constant travelers and already have three other major in the planning stages. We now build trips before we go with all the reservations. We will also use it for short trips. 

While it is exceptional just the way it is now, in the spirt of feedback here is a suggestion. Create a ‚Äúnote field‚Äù to record some general related info that the user may believe is relevant to the transaction. This would be different from the current ‚Äúnote‚Äù field that really functions more like a transaction title field that I believe could be retitled. 

In summary, if you‚Äôre looking for an easy to use but robust expense tracking App, you found a very good one! | We have been traveling for few months and we use the app to keep track of our budget every day since the beginning of our journey. It‚Äô s really well done and simple and intuitive. I recommended it for any one who like to travel like us. In addition the new version is nice upgrade. | We are full time travelers and so I use this app every day. It‚Äôs an excellent app, but I would appreciate being able to see a month view to track spending on a monthly basis in addition to by the trip. I‚Äôd also like the app to keep track of how many days long each trip is. I‚Äôd also like to be able to put in a daily budget and have the app calculate the budget for the trip based on the length of the trip I enter. Thanks! | It‚Äôs absolutely perfect for traveling, gives you your average daily spend. Let‚Äôs you know how much you have left, everything about it‚Äôs great. I even use it now as a college student to do simple budgeting for my daily life | User of paid for 4+ Years. I rarely write reviews.
TravelSpend App meets all my requirements for tracking multi currency travel expenses.
App can be used as simply or comprehensively  as user decides. 
Got immediate practical support from developer today. Thank you- and wish Prosperity again in 2023. | I actually enjoy tracking my expenses with this app! Love how I can split a cost into however many months needed, and that it converts to my home currency. | Downloaded the trial to test it out and input my travel expenses and all my data disappeared without any warning. Unless you want to pay $30+, don‚Äôt bother downloading. | Thank you so much for all of your time and effort creating this application! It has almost every feature you can think of and it is truly an amazing product!! 

Please consider adding the feature for a quick add in regards to expenses. Sometimes while on the go, you just want to add the amount and the title really quickly so you don‚Äôt forget about it later. Then when you have more time go back and put in all the details. I was checking out similar applications and you can check out the feature in Trip Coins app. They‚Äôre lacking several features you have, but they do have the quick add feature. I would recommend adding this to your 2.0 version. 
Also, it looks like they are one of your top competitors. One of the main differences is that their application is free, and yours requires a monthly subscription. I don‚Äôt mind paying, but to attract more customers you might want to think about a promotion or lowering your prices initially. 

Thanks again for creating a great application! Hope to see the quick add in the near future!! | Well thought out travel expenses tracking. Just enough features, without bloat. The team is responsive to suggestions. | I rarely say that about apps. We use this for all of our trips. | I‚Äôve tracked expenses in excel on backpacking trips before and it worked fine, but once I discovered this app, I knew I was never going back. It‚Äôs super easy to quickly jot down any expense right as I do the transaction. And the reporting it pretty neat too.

It crashes one second after opening üòû please fix.

Thank you for fixing it. Like I said before, awesome app. | This app is good! I used it on my honeymoon and it helped us stay on budget. 

My husband and I are moving overseas on an annual budget. I inputted our monthly income into various income categories for one month and thought that I could just duplicate it quickly, but found out that I can‚Äôt. That means I‚Äôll have to manually enter each income category‚Ä¶this is a dealbreaker unfortunately‚Ä¶

Please add this feature :( | There doesn‚Äôt appear to be a spot to record mileage. I emailed customer service but never got a reply???? | This is the best expense tracker I‚Äôve ever used. Once I set up the categories I needed, it‚Äôs been very easy for me to enter things daily. It‚Äôs really helped me keep track of what I am spending and what choices I have. | I gave this a try way back in 2017 for our trips and I loved the ease of use. I bought the app for a longer trip out of the country and was blown away by how easy it was to record all of my purchases in a different currency and have it presented to me in my home currency. Furthermore, the visuals and way information was presented made it super easy to understand where we stood in terms of our travel budget. 

Big kudos to the support through the app as well. Recently we migrated to iOS and the team helped us out immediately with our purchase from Android üéâüéâ | This is the best app I've found for tracking my expenses while backpacking and traveling around. Easy to use and nice charts of what you're spending money on. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a travel budgeting app. | This is all u need it. Perfect app for traveling on a budget, or if you like to have things organized. I love it! No words to describe how much it has helped me. I would give it a 10 stars if possible. | The best travel app available.  Job well done!   Worth the money! | Used this on a recent trip with my wife. It was perfect for keeping track of our travel expenses. Will definitely continue to use and recommend. | Love this app! I‚Äôve tried trial wallet & it roil always crash & never save anything and that‚Äôs about what the others did as well. So glad I found this app and tried it out. This app is amazing do far. It has how much spent and remaining and it doesn‚Äôt reset or crash like the others. This is eat I‚Äôve been looking for. Only travel twice a year so have the free version. üòÅ | Purchased the pro version and when adding expenses to any trip the app just completely shuts down every time. Trail Wallet is a much better app and 100% free with no ads. Wasted my money, don‚Äôt waste yours on this. | Entering data is easy, not as cumbersome as I had anticipated. 
And the statistics are very helpful.

When you want to access flight details you really need you have to scroll endlessly. | Used to be my favorite app for travel things. Now just deleted it. First never finds flight info under booking number anymore, and now every time you open app you need to type in your email and get a code which is stupid if you can set up Face ID Touch ID or whatever but not that stupid way. Disappointed and deleted it. | I attempted to give this app a try. I should have read the reviews first. There is limited synch with this app. This app does NOT Work. Pass it by. There is NO tutorial or how to use guide. You are guessing at this. | This app used to be great, giving you updates on your flight in the airport. Now it doesn‚Äôt even register an itinerary!
Looking at the positive reviews, they are from 5-6 years ago, now this app has become useless! | I‚Äôve been using the KAYAK app and wanted to try this one out. However, unlike KAYAK, which seems to ingest confirmation emails that are forwarded to it quite flawlessly, this app does not. Therefore, it makes things more difficult. Otherwise it has a slick interface. | The app was merely spammy and full of ads in the past; after the ‚Äòupdate‚Äô it is deprived of features, full of bugs, and still spammy. Doesn‚Äôt show anything when offline at foreign airports. That‚Äôs when you need the app the most. Trips can‚Äôt get deleted in the app once added through the chat bot! I‚Äôve cancelled flights and can‚Äôt remove them. When opening the app and swiping through flights, the app jumps to the first flight in the list randomly. Ridiculous programming. Trips can‚Äôt be added to calendar any longer. Trips don‚Äôt get update when the date for a booking number has changed (changed flight with airline) Today I received five times the same spam notification urging me to book a lounge through the app or their website. This app has become utterly useless, frustrating, and annoying (notification spam). Avoid! | Super annoying SLOW Assistant based interface - just give us a basic interface with fields to enter! | I cannot count the time wasted with your app. It is not helpful at all. I have tried every reference number to add my flights. I have tried to manually add and it has only added half my trip. This app is not helpful whatsoever. I sound not have had to work so hard to get my trips added. 
Makes me so frustrated | Don‚Äôt waste your time.  This used to be the best for my travels.  It has saved me from missing an overseas flight twice when the airline delay would make me miss the connecting flight to Germany. Since the last updates it is almost useless.  All the information that was so helpful is gone. So disappointing.  I would have paid to keep the previous version.  Deleted from my phone.  Looking for a replacement. | How could they screw this up so badly. This app now has been rendered useless. Can‚Äôt check on any detail about your flight, only simple things like flight numbers and time. THAT‚ÄôS IT!!! You can‚Äôt even see your seat and frequent flyer info. And if you have other people on the same booking? Just forget about it, you can‚Äôt check on anything whatsoever. What a f up update. Pointless indeed. | This app is just a scam to withhold your flight confirmation number. I‚Äôve learned my lesson. | It used to sync trip details with the calendar, not anymore | Used to be the best traveling app‚Ä¶ not it‚Äôs just an overly complicated chatbot under a wanna-be AI disguise that simply does not work. | I used to love this app and would use it to morganite every single trip and introduced it to several friends. Then they upgraded and it became completely useless. I wonder if the developers don‚Äôt see that usage has dropped. It would be better for them to revert to the former version honestly. This new version is just awful.  I have moved on to other travel apps. | It is clearly on the airlines flight schedule for that day. I sent in request for fixing it and they said working on it. Still nothing done or working. I deleted it as we are leaving in three weeks. | This app was a very good travel app but it has lost it‚Äôs way. Recently had to load booking code (6alpha numeric) to get flight information. This was OK. BUT when it provided ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù tap the app asked for the booking code. Why? No memory. App knows airlines but if you have already check-in the app can‚Äôt cross check with airlines.  I find it‚Äôs best to use the airline app and merely use this app (if at all) as a quick reference tool | I tried adding my trip manually several times and it kept giving me wrong flight info, and there is no way to update just one flight of a multi-flight itinerary, which is very frustrating.

I then emailed my itinerary as the other option suggested. When it came back it was still incorrect. 

Not worth my effort, deleted won‚Äôt try again. | Over the course of five days, I tried to add a trip using all three of the methods suggested.  I tried to manually add my trip at least 10 times all to no avail.  While this app used to be quite seamless, it now doesn‚Äôt seem to work and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anyone you can talk to.  The ‚Äúassistant‚Äù doesn‚Äôt connect you to a live person.  I‚Äôm ready to dump this app. | Something changed with this app and it‚Äôs totally nonfunctional, frozen screen, lost decades of travel data and absolutely zero customer service. | I used this app before, but suddenly it stopped working. Try to add trip and it send you to digital assistant and it goes nowhere | This was a good app a few years ago and extremely useful for a frequent traveler.  It would quickly identify your flights based on your ticket code and provide accurate, timely updates if flights were delayed etc.  Not now - since an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù (which apparently brought in ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù‚Ä¶) it rarely finds my flights from the reservation code and most times now you have to enter data manually, even when traveling on major airlines. The update facility has either disappeared or just doesn‚Äôt work anymore - I am sat in a plane which was announced to be delayed 6 hours ago and CheckMyTrip still hasn‚Äôt picked up on it.  It is now a complete waste of time.  I used to use this app all the time and rely on it for frequent travel.  Sadly it is going downhill rapidly‚Ä¶ | I heard about this app on a trusted travel forum.  I really just doesn‚Äôt work.  Can find my flights using confirmation code, cant find my reservation using flight/date combination.

Not worth the time I spent.  Deleted the app on Day 1 | Used to be a useful website and app, now totally useless. Fails to import bookings and relies on a stupid chat agent for doing anything. Just chasing the AI bandwagon by adding a dumb chat bot for basic functionality. Deleting my account and the app. | I‚Äôve been trying for 20 minutes to login for the first time. It keeps sending a code to my email and when I paste and add it into the app, it says it is an invalid code. Does anybody know if a better app to keep track of my travel itinerary? | We used to enter the booking reference but now it asks to enter each flight number and date ‚Ä¶ bit of a pain on a long trip with many flights and days | Doesn‚Äôt add trips either via forwarded email or manually.  No support.  Message app reply to request says basically that they are busy with other requests.  It‚Äôs worth the cost-i.e. nothing.  I use TripIt for all my travel ‚Äîgreat app and well worth paying for. | It takes forever trying to search your trip if its on a different email. They have ruined the app. Nobody wants to sit and chat with a bot and enter all flight details manually. Not a great idea. Should go back to the way it was. | So extra for no reason, AI used in app is trash I hope to god I never have to use it again | If you can‚Äôt access your email that you originally set up the account with you can never sign back in because the app will only send a code to the defunct email account. Its as dunb as it sounds. | It needs a way to correct a flight without deleting the entire trip. Flight from ORD-YVR comes up as Omaha to Chicago | This stupid AI app ever. Doesn‚Äôt work whata junk | Used to be comprehensive and good. Now, pathetic | Do not waste your time with this app | It working very well, why u change and remove everything, what is the point now from your current up?!!! | The new version is awful, fully stripped down of features and providing as little information as possible. New trips are difficult to add, they disappear after adding, while deleted trips reappear. The assistant is unhelpful. Amadeus is well equipped to provide a good product and this is clearly an act of self destruction. | The app used to be good without the digital assistant. From the reviews that I‚Äôve read, it looks like the developers aren‚Äôt looking to fix the app. Welp‚Ä¶.time to switch apps. | It was sooo much easier to use without the bot. Even after adding details, can‚Äôt see trip. Scrap the bit feature | The latest version of this app it is a huge mistake. 
I‚Äôve used CheckMyTrip for at least 20 years, even when it was just a webpage and not an app and with the new upgrade I cannot use it any longer. 
I used to store all my business and personal trip information using booking reference and my name info but now the only way to automatically import trip information with the booking reference is if you have personally booked the trip with your email address which it is not the normal practice in the business world. 
I hope that future versions will incorporate back the option to import bookings with the traveler info. | The update that requires use of a cumbersome chat bot for any inputs was a bad choice by the app developers.  It involves what should be in unnecessary inputs and is not initially intuitive. Please bring back the option to enter the old way.  Will not use this app, which I liked using before this change, until this requirement is removed and at worst the chat bit is an option. | We‚Äôve used this app in the past and it was awesome. From the last time we‚Äôve used it it has gone off a cliff horrible | This was a great APP prior to the latest update which crashed all of the data and no longer accepts confirmation numbers when you use a travel agent.  Sent in more than 5 requests to their customer support with no response.  I‚Äôve deleted the APP and made note of the developer to avoid any future APPs created by them. | New version is quite useless and not user-friendly. Unable to add trip easily like the old versions. I will probably not use this anymore and have to rely on each airline‚Äôs mobile app instead for each trip. | This had been a fine app.  In March, however, they rolled out a purported ‚Äúupdate‚Äù that simply does not work in any respect.  It‚Äôs not only useless, but it‚Äôs a negative ‚Äî you undertake actions to add flights to the app, only to find that there‚Äôs nothing there.  I cannot understand why they ever rolled out the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù or why, upon realizing that it was a complete bust, they didn‚Äôt go back to the old, functional app.  Unreal.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD IN ITS CURRENT STATE. | Was working great, a favorite app. Latest update requires a fresh log in and now my trip is lost and the Amadeus booking code is ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù Not happy. | The recent update destroyed the app. I used to really like this app prior to the recent update and probably would‚Äôve rated it as 4 or 5 stars for that version. However, since the most recent update the app is now a shell of its former self. It is clunky and hard to use, and 95% of the information it used to provide is gone. 
Don‚Äôt waste your time with this app so long as this is the version is in operation because it is useless in this form. | This app is practically worthless. Trying to add a trip in the app? Don‚Äôt bother. You won‚Äôt be able to unless you forward your confirmation email to the developer. This app is a horrible waste of time.

Update: I forwarded my trip confirmation email, received a reply email stating it was added, and it still doesn‚Äôt populate in the app. This app isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpractically‚Äù worthless‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs COMPLETELY worthless. | Last update makes you go into a chat with a virtual admin assistance and you cannot see your trips anymore. Big mistake, everyone I know is going to another app. | Latest update seems to have broke the app. I keep getting dummy notifications and emails for random trips that are not mine. | Won‚Äôt load my SW flights. Won‚Äôt load my cruise. Manually added my AA flights then it says error so that was a waste of time!!! Deleting this is app! I‚Äôll stick with individual apps to keep track of flights/cruise.";4.64917;3982;"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/c3/e6/d4/c3e6d4e8-ce35-b46c-1119-f2e139ef8147/4ce7ceff-9d42-4bfb-ac0f-b8bac5acbc20_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_0.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/ba/b1/b0/bab1b06b-bd8a-a4f3-b0ea-efdbc449f365/b0a66b61-67a3-4403-bcc3-59394f4dab43_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/53/05/28/53052861-0502-65c5-d83f-98055725b487/ddaee3a9-2c6b-44e6-b9f4-c8fe7c9978f9_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/18/17/88/18178817-5fbf-0ad6-093e-37ed940f60b0/08242e83-4853-4fe6-8621-61439db48245_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/ba/dd/4f/badd4f34-eadd-6519-07e9-2cd585ac1969/ae6bd580-e5c3-4296-ac87-1ea353dfb742_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/0c/6a/3a/0c6a3a55-3af8-0613-af66-9f8ac46acc6f/1de33973-d4d1-416b-a2f4-3c703ddf532a_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/62/55/0d/62550df5-78ce-7b8f-fbe6-c2d9efcbeae4/0e27cfc6-4ced-4c0a-adb0-a00811b338b9_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/a7/fb/b2/a7fbb2c6-3993-6101-0a2f-c4547ae4d2eb/5621bdb4-89b6-4f4b-800d-076a18b9bde7_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_7.png/392x696bb.png""]";"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/49/d8/e4/49d8e4f0-22b7-4259-13bf-4fbbc3189702/c4c9be8d-af7c-40b6-9be3-62e468eb786f_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_0.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/c7/ae/e3/c7aee36c-ec82-88bc-a56c-885e6fe84a10/5679faa9-f8a7-44cf-9f3f-e186e10032fb_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/20/d6/44/20d644b2-d205-26e1-7ff6-dd5c70fa4f6d/d3bd4f3f-b478-41ec-b379-fce77023989f_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/77/dc/42/77dc42da-80ed-aceb-807d-3a2ed46f0f49/fc7dd9e5-3bdb-425a-8989-7b182d8a3c03_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/dd/67/9a/dd679a80-9ec1-f59e-2674-b8d31b097a41/d05560b1-5ace-490e-804c-bde892e51adb_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/13/85/96/13859603-3109-03c4-a114-c387003992a0/4428603c-2d6f-47e1-b343-d0d4e3f1f7de_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_5.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/19/2a/9e/192a9eb7-a004-d00f-e886-364006b79aaf/539caa0c-b435-4198-a8e4-f2840f0ddd4c_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/c1/0b/85/c10b851d-b6ae-3736-7293-dd93a6c28622/115844be-e852-4c5a-9204-017cf2efb3a8_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_7.png/576x768bb.png""]";"[]";"[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-

I‚Äôm lucky they fly direct to all places I travel to. Boston, Orlando, puerto Vallarta, of course Hawaii. You can tell a good airlines by the way it‚Äôs employees treat their customers and their employees are always cheery and seem happy. Unlike other air carriers I know. Thank you and keep up the great service. Bob Tousignant | I tried to input my credit card information and it was sooo slooooow that I finally gave up! | Easy to book, easy to check in, and with heightened safety measures. Nice direct flight. | Lisa helped me book a flight to New Jersey. The new Newark airport on May 30 with a return on June 2 or third.
She was patient and so helpful. I can‚Äôt thank her enough. | I‚Äôve never flown with Alaska before but their customer service is excellent!! | 1st time app user to buy tickets with miles. Super easy and self explanatory. | Alaska cancelled my return flight reservation because I missed my first flight. No refund despite leaving me stranded in another city despite having paid for a return flight. Policy or not, this is totally unethical, unfair, and unreasonable. | So easy | Yeah!!!! 

I‚Äôve been asking for this feature for years. Other airlines have had it, and now Alaska enabled it. Makes TSA and boarding that much easier. 

Now‚Ä¶next request‚Ä¶allow rebooking on the app when there are flight irregularities. United‚Äôs app is really slick on this feature‚Ä¶so something to reference. 

Oh‚Ä¶and Live Activities with flight status. (Again, see United on this one as well.) | How lame is this? You have to leave the app and go to the Internet to book flights?!?! | always nice and great staff and less cancelations.. ‚ú® | Great service, great employees and great destinations! | The digital boarding pass gives me an error when I try to add it to my wallet. It‚Äôs the only airline app I have this issue with and it never works. The only workaround is to check in on the website and add the boarding pass to my wallet from safari. Digital boarding passes are 90 percent of the added value of having this app so the app becomes pretty much useless without that functionality. | Dealing with AK Airlines on their APP is easy and efficient; a welcome endeavor always. Timely and very helpful for us as we travel any time. We have never had any issue finding what we want while using the APP and online info re upcoming flights. | I love flying Alaska Airlines, especially to Alaska! | How can I preorder meal | I feel like Alaska airlines has done a great job over the years making their app very easy to use
Thank you Alaska for being a awesome airlines | App is easy to use. If Alaska flies to my destination perfect‚Ä¶need more cities and connections. | Flight costs are extremly high. Fewer routes to destinations. Look forward to more options with other airlines. Also, gate agents are unhelpful and flight attendants spend a lot time playing on phones. Alaska is not what it used to be. I loved it for years, with not a single complaint. I don‚Äôt even recognize the airline anymore. | Decent functionality and little to no glitches | Love Alaska Airlines. But when I try to add a calendar item it says that I need to give it permissions even though it has add event permissions. When I try to contact the devs to report it says they are not available. 
Love the airline, hate the app support | No option on my phone to create a password | AK Air used to have the best customer service. Not anymore. Alaska Air is now constantly adequate, like other airlines. Occasionally incompetent, like other airlines. Coupled with decreasing mileage plan rewards, my loyalty to the brand is greatly diminished. | Very good company. | I was extremely frustrated while trying to enter my credit card information and purchase the ticket. 

First, it required me to add a new card and go through an entire cycle. Then, it refused to process the ticket. I re-attempted several times. Then I cancelled the search started again. This time I tried to 2nd credit card which was already on file and it took me out of the app. so I reapplied the search and started over again, entered the information manually, rather than using the saved information on the same exact card, and it finally went through. | Alaska airlines reservation agent was so helpful when my husband and I each had miles and wanted to purchase tickets for daughter and 2  grandchildren.  Agent  walked us through ‚Äî first my reservation with my miles for 2 members, then helped my husband reserve a ticket using his miles for one grandchild. Alaska is always helpful for planning family trips. | When I book a trip through another application and my FF# is attached I would expect to see that pulled over into my trips?  Is this a feature Alaska Airlines system has? | App UI is better than the web. | I use the app all the time, never any issues. | My flight info will not populate my trip for today and can‚Äôt get boarding pass | Impossible to log in with my email and password, won‚Äôt let me create a new login | Always friendly!!  Seriously,  Alaska airline employees are always friendly. | Satisfaction guaranteed | With all the info that may need to be entered and selecting seats, the app times out too soon. | Ang, the AMAZING customer service agent from Idaho for AA, just booked flights for 5 of us. She helped us through the entire process advising us on companion fares, miles, traveling with baby, luggage, saving money, booking hotel and car through AA, everything!!! We can not Thank Her enough for her Compassion and Excellent Customer Service!!!! 
Please give this woman a promotion and raise for her knowledge and fantastic customer care!!! | I‚Äôve been flying AK for 30yrs. Love it | This is not good | I love the airline, how they treat their customers and more so how easy the app is to maneuver. | Alaska website and IOs App do not work well. Unlike other airline websites and Apps it is not user friendly or intuitive and makes the passenger experience with them to be frustrating. On a recent flight from SFO we checked-in online and paid for luggage, yet upon arrival at the airport we unable to drop-off luggage and had to wait another 50 minutes in line, needlessly. | Love how easy it is and how accurate Alaska is! | I love using Alaska air but I have noticed this little glitch that made me have to use laptop instead of this app‚Äî
I cannot enter ‚Äú Los Angeles (all airports ) in the flight search , it always just direct me to LAX . Meanwhile the website is able to do so . Please fix this! I love to see the alternative options of airports in great Los Angeles area. Thank you | Used to praise Alaska Air for many reasons 
Now scared to climb aboard 
those Boeing jets 
How much insurance is included in the price of a ticket? | I was forced to check my bag even though most of the overhead bag spaces were empty | I am not handicapped but as I age (73) I find that long travels through big airports is difficult and painful. I suspected on this flight my trip from gate to gate would be significant. 
I called your customer service representative who is In Boise. She was pleasant and talked to me like she had a smile on her face; an unexpected pleasure. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was necessary to be in a wheelchair. She patiently discussed it with me while I was trying to decide. She said I could always call at a later time if I wanted. Ten minutes later I called back and was pleased to talk to the same agent who was just as pleasant and accommodating. 
Thank you for keeping your employees onshore. Perhaps it is less expensive to send your call centers to an offshore contractor, but I appreciate your keeping American workers working. In this case it certainly paid off with a satisfied customer. 
Julie Holzer | The flight attendants is very aware of My accessibility Aye sure p | Why doesn‚Äôt the app sync with the main website. On many occasions when there are schedule changes, I accept them on the web-based site, and then the changes are not reflected in the app. This causes a lot of problems because I use the phone app to get my boarding pass and the last couple times I have had to call customer service, and it taken multiple attempts to get the changesaccepted so that I could actually use the app. It‚Äôs a little frustrating when the two are not speaking to each other. | App works great, on my iPhone.

I also hate the forecast  they added to the bottom of the display. Why take something that works and mess with it? | I turned off notifications, but still received them. I was also receiving multiple notifications for the same exact alerts. So annoying. | I hav e had this as go to for many years, now with ‚Äòupdates‚Äô all I get is crash after 2-4 seconds.  Deleted it. | At 84 years of age I have lots of experience with weather forecasting. I trust my own judgement and with the help of your radar I don‚Äôt even have to go outside to do it. 
As a child, my father and I would go outside and watch the sky and judge if we needed to go to the storm cellar or back in the house. A couple of time it was a quick trip!
Kansas is known for its unpredictable weather. Cliches like: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like the weather, just wait a few minutes, it will change.‚Äù And my favorite, which is always right, ‚Äúit is going to be light today and dark tonight.‚Äù | ‚Ä¶me to this App. Not always as accurate as Dark Skies was, but the best one going.  Sometimes it‚Äôs gotten a little wonky‚Äîlike Silver Spring MD for example.

 But in comparison to other weather apps, this is my current gold standard. Would be nice if they crowd sourced weather‚Ä¶thought like that might have helped with accuracy of predicting weather and timing. | Good | This is an interesting app with great info, but it can't even locate me correctly?  It reports me in Junction Texas when I am in San Angelo.  These are NOT very close locations.  

Keep trying guys ... | I know people need to get paid but seriously! How many adds do I need? | Just subscribed today! End of February! | Warnings and forecasts and my location cover the radar on the map. Not very high resolution. Pretty but not that useful. There are better apps. | The advertisement for this app says free, UNTIL, you download it and you‚Äôre informed that it is ‚Äú free ‚Äú for three days, then you have to choose a subscription service. | Very impactful! | I've tried using this, and it expects payment. It's not that user-friendly, and keeps giving me forecast of other areas that I've already left.

Whatever happened to where apps and automatically sits where you are now?

This is obviously not one of them. | Used to be great! Over the past year or so tho, the new developers decided to revamp the look, now it's totally broken. Have to go thru a ritualistic open and close the app two times just to see the temperature.
And the layout is horrible! | I wrote a ChatGPT called Motorycle Mapper Pro and I use this to back it up, turn by turn directions without tolls and highways! Good Job | I really like this weather app so far very accurate has everything I need. The one thing I have problems with is the widget every morning it is blank takes a while for it to warm up and start working. | Thank you love it. | The two small towns I frequent and want to know the forecast for do not populate. They are large enough to populate on all other weather apps.
This is very disappointing. | I just wanted to thank everyone for the support I get in getting through this winter with the accurate information and the fact that you guys are always spot on. I hope you all have a great 2024üëçüåè | This app wants $600 a year to look at the weather? | Nice app but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any way to unsubscribe so be prepared to pay for it for the rest of your life | Porn ads | The actual radar of this ‚ÄúWeather Radar‚Äù app is completely meaningless. They now only provide 120 minutes of historical data and ZERO time of future radar.  I have several weather apps, all free, this one is no longer of any value so I am deleting it. | Outstanding.I can keep up with the weather in all my important places! | This app sends out tons of notifications for storms that aren‚Äôt even happening. The weather predictions are not even close to accurate. I got 7 notifications, one per hour, for a so called blizzard that isn‚Äôt predicted on any other weather platform. It is not even snowing. Do not recommend. | Radar only goes about 1 hour ahead.  Useless. | Gracias | Worst radar app I have ever used , it will be raining on me and this app shows nothing in my area . Don‚Äôt waist your money and time. | The number one in weather forecast.. | First off- this app does not recognize my city. No matter how I try it calls Cedar Rapids ‚ÄúEast Rapids‚Äù. Not a big deal but indicative and annoying. The hourly forecast is rarely useful. Especially when the weather is dynamic. I guess it does give me weather alerts, but my radio can do that. Just waiting for my subscription to run out. | Too much upselling. How many times do I have to say NO! | Always give the correct news of weather!!!! | Obnoxious selling of prenup | I like the game but I keep lagging and keep getting kicked out. It might be me because my tablet it old. Overall I think it is a great game. | I've downloaded every weather app, this one is most accurate and fav | This app is un accurate, not real time weather another words you‚Äôre gonna get wet if you look at there is rain coming | This is a really good weather app and has nice info | Force you to weekly subscription unless you cancel.  Not easy to cancel.  If I‚Äôd known, no way I would have purchased. | Widgets no longer work üòü | I miss the old weather app Dark Sky. One of the things I loved about Dark Sky was that it was able to give you a view of the radar over multiple days.

The current Apple , weather map only gives 12 hours and not multiple days. To me this is a major failing. | I wish that you could see more of the weather on the radar because I love weather and want to see it without paying for stuff. | Enjoy looking to see where and when we may get some rain. | Charts not synchronized. Text and data overlap on the screen; they‚Äôre almost unrecognizable. | Living in a constant zone of changes, much of daily life is dictated by our weather. I use this app daily & have for years . | Ok | So many ads and attempts to get a premium version that you can‚Äôt even see the program! A storm in the Caribbean is NOT showing!!!

It rained the entire time. Most of the rides we wanted to go on were closed except hagrid. We waited in the rain and cold for 3 hours and just before it was our turn they shut down the ride so we had to leave. | Great app but it would be nice to sort the rides by favorite too. I don‚Äôt want to know wait times for ones that aren‚Äôt. Handy for in park use, planning, and ordering food. | Over sold the fast pass. | Universal forced me to download the app to order lunch because they don‚Äôt do in person ordering anymore. Every page asks you to give them permission for something else. By the time I actually place my order it‚Äôs 15 pages. Then I find out I have to make an account to order. All I want is to eat a chicken sandwich. Universal is making me sell them my soul in exchange | Good morning I just wanted to let you know that I am going to be in the office today to get my car fixed and I will be in the car for a little bit and then I will be in the house to pick up the car and then I will be home I will be there in about an hour and a half to get the car and then I will be back to the office and I will be in the office for a little while I will be in the office I love you and I hope you have a great day and I hope all your day and I hope you‚Äôre having a good day and I hope to see you soon bye love you bye see you bye love you bye love you see you guys bye love you bye love mom bye love you bye love dad eeeweeee bye love you bye love grandma bye love you bye love to you have a good day bye love you bye love and miss you bye love you bye talk | HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER   Also, I really enjoy using the app. I can find my way around easily. üòÅ | Love the park | this app is very good! when you have a big group this is the best way to see where you want to go and to see if you think everyone will ride the rides. my only question is if there is any way to only see rides no the water park. | The lines are very long so I went to upgrade for a fast pass. They wanted an additional $182.00.  So $400 just to visit the park.  Greedy. Also I had to store my fanny pack in a locker to go on a ride, Hagrids, Had to pay $3.00. The one at The Hulk was free.   I will say the park is beautiful | Must have for a visit to universal! It does everything and improves your visit | For $169.00 I would like a paper map!  Don‚Äôt mind an app for wait times but not user friendly to try and continually see where you are and where the next attraction is.  Will never come back! | I like universal very much hooray | Hice el proceso de compra de boletos, cobraron pero de boletos nada. | I copy from Minecraft | Despite Universal pushing for mobile ordering, the app will not let you do so unless you enable location tracking, which I am unwilling to do. | I downloaded the app and have tried every other day multiple times to make an account and it will not work. I really hope we won‚Äôt need it when we visit since it doesn‚Äôt work.. | I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but I regularly use to universal app and the new changes are mostly good. From the ease of us, I hope the developers change the size of the wait times in the app to be larger and easier to take a quick glance at. The small size of the font choice in the update is too small and I feel like my eyes are hunting for the information I am looking for in the app. It used to be much better and easier to see quickly how long of a wait for my favorite ride. Please change it back in some form! | Nice start to using this app.  The first thing it does is ask you to create an account.  But then it gives an ‚ÄúOops there‚Äôs an error in processing this request‚Äù. Over and over.  I uninstalled it and tried again with the same outcome over and over.  I see in other comments that is has been happening for years. | *Updated maps -

- Like the color codes area but when clicking on anything the map zooms in. That doesn‚Äôt help when you need a wide view to get from current spot to where you want to go. Please make it stop zooming in.

- When looking for dining/food only shows top tier hotels.  Stop trying to sway people to theses please! 

- There is a lag when scrolling. Gets ‚Äòstuck‚Äô on images. 

Overall- liked previous map much better. | There needs to be more directional signs!! Great fun otherwise!! A day well $pent. | User interface clunky 
Needs pinch zoom feature 
Wait times not always accurate 
Should have Single Rider info 
Should have ability to make table reservations at the park | The Value Resorts have been removed from the app. This is very inconvenient! | Actually a wonderfull experience for all the family, love it | Ever since the update, the app does not load past the initial loading screen. Just stays on ‚Äúuniversal Orlando resort‚Äù. Turned phone off and on, uninstalled and reinstalled, would never load past the first screen. With the app being the only way to order at mobile only locations and all maps being digital, you are restricted in what you can do. Brought this concern to the islands of adventure guest service desk and apparently all physical maps have ‚Äúdisappeared from existence so that we can save the planet‚Äù (his words) and we were told to wait in line at places like minions cafe to ‚Äúhopefully get helped‚Äù (again, his words). He then pulled his phone out, said his phone app worked and told me it must just be a problem with my phone.

Don‚Äôt expect help or solutions if you experience this same issue as I and my entire party experienced. | Since opening, my wife and I have enjoyed coming to universal at least once a year from our cold weather state.  Understanding that the world has changed in  that time,  getting though ticketing and the the primary gate of the studio continues to take more and more effort on every visit. Today took over a hour from getting in line to buy tickets and then final passing through the entrance. The fact that the que line for tickets was less than 100 total souls in it makes it even more disconcerting. I know we can get tickets on line that might help some but like today we are sitting at breakfast and it was a last minute decision. 20 minutes or even 30 would be acceptable on a busy day but an hour plus is not.  In an era where speed of execution is paramount, I feel like universal has failed at their initial point of contact with its guests. | We look forward to pre-ordering our donuts before we leave it‚Äôs a family tradition and now it‚Äôs not on the app to be able to order but the restaurant is still here and operating. If you tap on it in the map and select order it just errors out. What‚Äôs going on? | Ever since the new update my app won‚Äôt work at all gets stuck on logo screen and won‚Äôt do anything else, deleting and re adding app doesn‚Äôt fix anything, I am now stuck not being able to mobile order or view my tickets or see wait times or anything, never should have updated | It is NEVER working. Always delayed broken or something. | Been at Universal all day today and never got the app to work. Downloaded, deleted, restarted maybe 10x. Must be some bug because I‚Äôm pretty good with this stuff. | Too many steps to place a mobile table order
Had issues with the scanning and the staff had NO Clue how to assist.  Absolutely terrible! | I just downloaded this app today to use while I‚Äôm in the park. Bought my tickets yesterday and had them sent to my phone. Unfortunately I could not open an log in because it kept saying ‚Äúoops something went wrong. Please try your request again later‚Äù. It has been doing this all day. I was not even able to order my food online. They tell you you have to order your food online through the app, but then the app tells you to sign in and that‚Äôs where the trouble is. I tried resetting my password twice, and it still doesn‚Äôt work. Honestly, I‚Äôm at a loss. I can‚Äôt recommend this app to anybody. | You need to add the ability to sort your favorite rides by wait time | Too much $ and too few attractions. Many of the standout attractions have been replaced with stores and eateries. | Doesn‚Äôt cache your tickets, so you have to wait for them every time to use them. Should integrate with Apple Wallet like the other resorts. You can ‚Äúheart‚Äù things, but what is the point as you can‚Äôt filter or sort for that? Complete failure. Navigation for reading menus is pretty inconsistent from one dining location to the next. No easy way to search for specific food options for truly picky kids.  When you use dietary filters for dining it instead shows rides?! Complete failure to serve the purpose. | The newest update 6.0 is not working. It just loads the logo and then nothing else works. Don‚Äôt download it or upgrade until the figure out this bug. I am going to the parks next week hopefully they will have it fixed by then. | Loved the app, but it won‚Äôt load anymore, and we have a trip coming up soon it‚Äôs very disappointing, I‚Äôve tried everything from, deleting and reinstalling to resetting my phone‚Ä¶ | Worked the first day in the park and now it will not load. I have restarted. I have deleted and reloaded. Nothing works. | App not registering correct quantities | It was my first time to the theme parks of universal orlando. 
The adventure park needs 2 days and was amazing, the volcano bay park was unique we like it though the weather was a bit chilly. Universal studios main park was good but the least one we liked. | The app won‚Äôt log me in it just sits there saying logging in. The support website is for sale by the domain registrar. 

Please update so I can login and provide an accurate developer website in the store. | The new app is very confusing to use and very jerky to use. The previous app was much more intuitive and smoother to use. | App worked for one day then stopped loading. It's been raining so appear tickets are getting so wet taking them out to get them scanned for park to park movement that we have to have them reprinted 3 times. Oddly enough it seems to only be me having issues with the app and the app people told me they couldn't help but would escalate it. They did transfer the tickets to my wife's account so we could use them but now the app won't even download onto my phone after trying the whole delete redownload thing | What a blast!  Celebrated my 70th birthday at Universal!!!!!!!! The Spider-Man and the ride had me all shook up !!!!! The Universal Mardi Gras parade and riding the Jester‚Äôs Float made all my dreams come true!   What a Blast!!!!! Thank you. | Still can‚Äôt keep my Premier Pass barcode in the app.  I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs because of the after-4 express entitlement, but when I can create my own with the barcode in another wallet app (to use with lockers), there‚Äôs no excuse why the barcode can‚Äôt be included in the Universal App. 

That‚Äôs the only thing keeping me from giving this a five star review. | I‚Äôve had the app for years and whatever the recent update was is horrible. Hard to figure out what your looking at and the wait time is the smallest part of the info? | It is very relaxing, I always go with my family and they love it and I love it too. They have the best rides and in my opinion better than Disney. | The 6.0 update have made the universal app very laggy and sluggish. The scroll is not smooth, and it makes the app very hard to use. It seems like the app was re-written using Flutter and it ruined the app‚Äôs performance. The app also takes up an insane 2.45 GBs of storage on my phone.

You‚Äôll find great trip plans that you never even considered! Don‚Äôt like to walk a lot or use a certain mode or transit agency? Personalize your travel in the settings.  

4) GO: OUR STEP-BY-STEP NAVIGATOR*
Receive departure alarms to catch your bus or train, and get alerted when it‚Äôs time to get off or transfer. When using GO, you‚Äôll also crowdsource more accurate info and real-time ETAs for other passengers‚Äì and rack up points and thank yous for being the most helpful rider on your line.

I‚Äôm an engineer and even I don‚Äôt find the use of this application intuitive. | This app is wrong about 80% of the time, don‚Äôt bother wasting ur time | So you want to charge to use but then the features don‚Äôt work! No thanks! | So convenient | As the title says, this app should show the bus/train number and not just the route number/name. 

You say you use data from the CTA. The CTS data includes the bus/train number so you should be able to include that info. The CTA‚Äôs own website - ctabustracker.com/map shows both the bus route number and bus number. | Hard to use, sometimes accurate | My bus drivers are courteous & helpful. But‚Ä¶. Please put some paper schedules on the bus. Also, getting a monthly pass is hard to do. Please give info on your app for instructions if possible. Have been riding the Comet for 7 years so thank u. Am a senior. | Awesome app ! Very accurate. Highly recommended üëèüèΩ | Usually pretty reliable, more so than Google Maps in NYC, but sometimes it cites inaccurate info on the route. For example, bus stops that no longer exist, or have moved. There is no way to flag a correction either. | I used many times in the past. Now that I need to use it again, I find out it is no longer free. I am a Senior on a very fixed income. Bye Bye.  I‚Äôll find another app that is free. | All your times this evening were completely wrong for bus 448. | Could be better, seems like the app doesn‚Äôt effectively show current lines that are closer to you time wise. The app tends to favor plans that are 20-30 minutes into the future so when you could make an earlier route, transit doesn‚Äôt offer it. | The buses are often 2-4 minutes behind what the actual location tracker indicates. | Long atory short - Get to stops at least 10-15 minutes earlier than bus is scheduled.

It‚Äôs a great app that has helped me go through a new city I'm visiting- but the only problem is it doesn‚Äôt tell you when the bus is late or early. 

I‚Äôve missed buses that came 10+ minutes early to the bus stop with no warning that it was so early. Most times I was 1 minute away from the bus stop but missed it cause the buses don‚Äôt stop.
 I know it‚Äôs more efficient for the buses to not stop at a stop where there aren‚Äôt people standing but when I‚Äôm 20ft away from the stop and all I can do is watch as the bus speeds past at least 10minutes earlier than expected, and the next one won‚Äôt come in over an hour it‚Äôs frustrating.
It would be great if they had a notification that tells you your ride is going to be early or late. 

10 minutes early is great when you‚Äôre on the bus, | Misinforming the people | Not always accurate | It‚Äôs a great app | Es muy practico y confortable | Buses keep showing up without appearing on the app. I‚Äôve walked away from bus stops thinking the wait is too long. However, a bus then shows up, and I miss it. GO feature keeps breaking, so users can‚Äôt provide more reliable arrival information. Great design, poor development. | The app would be perfect if the busses were a little more accurate, but my main issue is that if I paid for bus tickets they shouldn‚Äôt expire unless the bus fare changes. | What is the problem with real time data?!? App says my bus isn‚Äôt coming for 27 minutes so I took the other bus that takes longer to get to work. As i get of the bus HERE COMES THE 563 which wasn‚Äôt supposed to arrive until 25 minutes PAS ME BUY WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE LIES. Now I‚Äôm stuck in a winter storm waiting on a bus that takes double the time for me to get to work! I honestly HATE YALL FROM THE EORKED TO THE CEO AGAIN I HATE YALL! Again on November 17th On my way to the bus stop in no rush TRANSIT SAYS NEXT BUS TO DETROIT 38mins. Liars & trash bags THE BUS I NEED 563 speeds past me! This below average app can‚Äôt keep track when that‚Äôs the only reason it available! Again I HATE & LOATHE THIS APP! Crackheads. February 18 2024 3:19pm arrived @ 7mile & Gratiot stop going to 23mile Transit app keeps updating and adding 20mins when the bus should have arrived. Instead of just going GRAY you keep adding time so I have NO IDEA WHEN THE BUS IS ACTUALLY ARRIVING. Y should citizens pay for lack of transparency and accountability and decent public transportation. I‚Äôm sure government subsidies are granted to Smart. Is this what WE pay for??? Again just flipped adding another 20mins. I have to see if I can petition for an overhaul of the system. March 13 2024 9:48pm 4 buses are @ the beginning of the ROUTE 30 minutes have gone by not 1 bus has left?!? TRASH TRASH TRASH YET THE TIMER ADDS 6min every time the 6min are up! The punishment should be STEEP | it is crazy that a transit app would even CONSIDER putting the visibility of bus lines behind a paywall. at least in Pittsburgh, the app only lets you look at a couple of the closest bus lines to you- unless you pay for transit royale, which doesn‚Äôt get you any actual bus fare or do anything except unlock what should be core app features. the publishers are insanely out of touch, the city should drop this app | I keep seeing this banner nudging me to enable notifications despite dismissing it every single time. You know what would make my experience better? Not having to do that. Please demand your pathetic product managers justify this borderline user-hostile harassment. It's so transparently fake. It isn't about making the experience better, it's about pumping metrics. The experience without notifications works just fine for me. Respect your users decisions! | My first time using it today I love it | What a beautiful app! Keep up the great work team (designers and developers)! | Great app, very useful for me and those who need to use transit! | I use this app everyday and its so helpful I recommend this app over any other transportation app !! | The transit app is my absolute go to that helps me navigate my day to day route connections. The app is robust and it‚Äôs extremely percise. I can purchase transit and bike passes & it worked well in every city that I have visited. I love this app. Thanks Transit! | My account got deleted and they restored me right away. No fuss no muss. 
Accurate as can be! Use in many cities. I love this app. | In Maryland, this app would be useful if it provided the bus bay numbers since there are transit centers with a dozen bus stops and it is impossible to learn in the app which bus bay or side of the street to get the bus. | First time riding public transportation and I really enjoyed it!  Thank you üòä | I take the bus for my daily commute. The ability to see real time locations of PT and being given multiple options with anticipated timelines is top tier. Being on the bus or train and answering questions so that rather can enjoy a better experience promotes investment in participation. I‚Äôm also a huge nerd about the leaderboards for all the transit lines. #1 babyyyyyy | It keeps changing screens giving me more options rather than the bus #s I'm trying to use. | I understand it may not have the right time but a 2 hour wait ,half way into the trip is unacceptable. I‚Äôd rather ask google they are more helpful then this thing ever was. | It is far from being accurate and it is not user friendly for questions and answers in real time | M35 is the worst bus service system | Live tracking feature makes commuting so much easier. The more people use this, the better the app becomes. Could not recommend more. | An immensely convenient app to use. Enjoyable, reliable, smart. Highly recommend. | We need different types of maps to choose from so we can se where we actually are | Please add more options to report danger on transit and conditions on bus stops. Stepped into water today | I use transit every time I need to take the bus, and it‚Äôs proven to be a very handy tool. Great user interface, and there‚Äôs a system where it lets you see how many other riders you‚Äôve assisted with real time location information, and that makes me feel like I did a good deed, no matter how small. | I been using this app since middle school I graduated in 2019 best app, better than any transit app | I want to see all busses that I am transferring to | This app just keeps getting worse since they want you to pay for to the royal trash.  Switching to maps on my phone. I can pretty much get everything I need for FREEEEE.  Your sustainability plan just doesn‚Äôt make sense. | Departures and arrivals are 90% accurate with this app. | The bus was 10 minutes late and then straight up passed me. Didnt stop for me even though they saw me standing there. | Excelente | Hands down the best app for public transportation has a beautiful ui and the live tracking is always accurate. | Why have a transit app that‚Äôs not accurate aoth timing and doesn‚Äôt show bus delays? Had to call MTA customer service to find out #4 bus was having massive delays/ cancellations.
