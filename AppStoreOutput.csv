SEE IT ON A MAP

Every time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.

STORE PLANS OFFLINE

All your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.

GET ON THE ROAD

Looking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.

COLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS

For group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.

STAY ORGANIZED

Access flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.

GET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION

For each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.

CONTROL YOUR SPENDING

Set a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/04/99/7d/04997d95-7783-c032-fbaf-0eeb52bbbd68/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","106180608","13.0","2019-08-22T07:00:00Z","2024-04-11T22:31:17Z","Wanderlog's available in more languages!

That helped me creating my route to my trip to Japan. I will definitely use it for my next trip. | This app is so amazing. I highly recommend it. After using it to plan a 4 month trip I love it. It does all it says it does. A thing or 2 I could only do on the app or on the computer but I could do all it says it does. On one thing I had a question and got a quick & detailed response from the developer (email is in the help section of app). | I was hoping this would work for road trips. Things do do from Point A to Point B | Just got back from a 9 day on-the-go Spain trip.  Wanderlog made planning the trip easier (being able to visualize everything on the map and drag-and-drop places to different days/times was great!).  We put in all of our flights/trains/rental-cars, restaurants, sites...  And my wife and I were able to collaborate. I'd get excited seeing her putitng in a Flamenco concert she booked for one evening for example. And then on the trip, it was so nice to have one place to reference for everything about our plans. 

I can honestl say Wanderlog made our trip better than it would have been. | I literally unsubscribed from the free trial offer five minutes after adding it and was still charged. And with you’re “refund policy” being only if an enforcement company requires you to, you actually don’t care about your users. Just greedy. I would like my money back | Great app for organizing your trip!  From collecting reservation information to identifying attractions to creating itineraries. It does it all. Highly recommended! | I’ve been using Wanderlog for close to a year now and very much love the app + website. For each destination, I start with a master list of places of interest. Using existing lists are extremely helpful to make the master list. Then I build an itinerary from it. Adding approximate time spent at the place and the app providing time between the places helps a lot when planning. What I’ve been most impressed with is the robustness of the app. I haven’t had any issue with incorrect information, data loss, app crashing or unavailability. The UI / UX is very intuitive. They have quite a few other features that I can being useful. | This app has made planning vacations so much easier to organize! I love how simple it is to build my itinerary and see how things are situated on the map. It’s also great for tracking how much money I’m spending! A must have for travelers! | Well, I was told I would get notification after my free trial period before they took my money. But that did not happen and they refuse a refund. So try at your own risk, but you might get your money stolen. | I don’t ever really write reviews, but I love to travel. I had mostly been writing out my itineraries on paper, but than I decided it might be easier to do with an app. So I downloaded a bunch, like 10, and just tried them out. Wanderlog was truly, by far, above the rest. The budget feature in particular was fantastic, I went to Europe with a bunch of friends and it was really helpful for tracking expenses, and the fact that it automatically converts currency within calculations is really helpful and a nice touch. I now use wanderlog every time I travel and I really love it. | This app has it all. I love all of the organization. The mapping is the best part! I also love knowing how long it will take to get from place to place. The only drawback is, in some there google driven guides the places are closed for good. | Love the sharing option. Makes itinarary so much easier. | This has been amazing app from throwing ideas together to really finalizing the smallest details.  However, what is more important is the support team, I spent months putting a trip together and accidentally deleted it, within hours they were able to restore my trip and save me hours of recreation, and many more tears. | One of the best apps i used in japan, it really organized my trip. | first of all, it is deceiving when it says sign up for the pro version for roughly around three dollars a month when in reality you sign up for the annual price it does not give you a month-to-month option. 

Second of all the pro features don’t even work the whole point was for it to pull your itinerary information and add your flight info automatically. instead it pulled old itineraries from the last year or two that are already irrelevant. I don’t understand why it would search that far back and my most recent emails with the upcoming flight info couldn’t even be added into the app. I had to manually add my flight info. 

third of all as soon as you create your account, your bombarded with 20+ pop-ups I selected no more tips and it’s still kept coming up with all of these pop-ups. It was so annoying. | Would recommend it to anyone 
Help me and my girlfriend sort out everything we needed easily during our travels | I acquired this app based on its outstanding reviews; however, it has proven to be a profound disappointment. Not only is it functionally inadequate, but it also requires a subscription. Rather than providing useful suggestions, it merely retrieves articles about activities in various cities, a task I could easily perform myself. My primary desire was for quick itinerary suggestions, a feature this app fails to deliver. Additionally, its incessant interruptions to offer tips on its interface only compound the frustration. One must question the design decisions that led to such a cumbersome user experience. | Such a nice app to lean on when you have a trip planned and have a lot of cooks in the kitchen of planning 😄 | Really great app | I have waited all my life for a way to plan trips this efficiently. Thank you for making such an incredible app! I tell everyone about it. | This app helped me keep a month long multi-city trip through Europe organized.  I love that it has the ability to forward emails to your itinerary and it will upload the confirmation directly for hotels, transit and other reservations.  I was able to share it with my co-travelers and they can add points of interest and help with to-do list and wish lists.  If this can keep me organized so easily, then it’s definitely worth it! | If you’re a freak about organizing your trips, everything about this app is spot on! | I tried this for LA and it had locations WAY far off like Palm Springs Liberace house. It also had a charity museum that had no activity on instagram since 2020….unless I’m missing something.  Also the charity location is an hour away from the location I input.  It had a “permanently closed” restaurant listed.  Wasted my time.I don’t get it . | this app would be amazing if fully worked!! won’t let me add certain places to my lists. no reason. just does nothing when you click add. don’t have this problem using the web version ?? | I use my home town in Delaware and asked for it to suggest some places to go out to eat. Well it picked three places I never heard of, the name of the town was right but they were in Canada a few hundred miles away. 
Ok so I understand this is a trip planner but I’d love to have a better control over where the heck this AI thinks I should go. Nope, not going to buy this one! | So helpful!! This made our trip so much better. It makes planning easier and more fun, and traveling so much less stressful. Love the map feature where you can see the layout of your itinerary. I kept everything in my notes app before and it was a pain. You need this! Love the free features too. | I love this app! I can make checklists (packing lists and lists to help me remember what I need for each daily adventure). The way you can forward a hotel or flight or rental car reservation and it automatically adds it all to your itenerary including confirmation numbers, addresses and cost for your budget is phenomenal. I love how it offers suggestions on sights to see and things to do and places to eat. Plus all of my friends or family whom I invite to share it with can also have all the information right at hand. I’d give this app 100 stars if possible. I’ve used it for 5 trips now and will never use anything else. | A great app for traveling together with friends. Easy to upload accommodations, schedules, and finances. If you are traveling with friends this app is perfect. I highly recommend it!!! | Ever since I discovered Wanderlog, I’ve used it to plan every trip I’ve been on and have told anyone who will listen about it. The app’s itinerary building functions, the option to create different lists, and the ability to share with others makes it indispensable. It’s near perfect and I recommend the following to the developers: allows old trips to be archived automatically based on dates, allow blocking for nonspecific activities in the itinerary, incorporate the visited map from the web into the app, and add a feature to organize places you’d like to visit by continent, country, etc. | Overall this is an amazing all. I’ve always used google sheets to plan my trip because the alternatives weren’t great. For the first time, I started using an app that solves my need right from planing to on the road. 

Having said that, the app is slow when you add many locations. Additionally, the drive times are incorrect on the app. So I have to switch to computer. The route optimization cannot be done across multiple days. If some of these can be fixed, I’ll be happy to pay for the app. | I’m type A personality and I knew for my trip I needed somewhere I could write down an itinerary. Wanderlog was that and more! I loved being able to plug in all the things and have everything in one place. Thank you thank you thank you! | I had great hopes in using this app. However, it is not sophisticated enough to insert manual planning. I have a trip already planned that I tried to set up in this app and it just doesn’t work. I already have plane tickets, hotels, cruise, etc. It just won’t let me EASILY add everything. Not worth the effort in trying to figure it out. Stick with the spreadsheet!! | I downloaded this app to plan a roadtrip to the Philippines. I love how simple and customizable it is. I also love that you can share it to people and they don’t have to download the app to view or edit it. Most locations I need are searchable. It’s mostly free until I want to save it offline which is great because I can plan free before my trip and only pay for it when I need it.

Some suggestions that would make this app even better: 
- Having the option to make certain pages private
- Being able to mention your tripmates and make action items so it’s clear on who is responsible for what
- Being able to pool money as a trip mate and assigning who is responsible for paying. I feel like a lot of group trips, there is a designated person for food, lodging, gas, etc.
- Being able to customize the color of Notes. I have a few and it blends in really well with the Places because they are the same color.
- Being able to assign sub-budgets, perhaps by Place you’re going to or by type of expense (food, lodging, gas etc) | We used Wanderlog for the first time on a 10 day trip and it was amazing!  Easy to set up, great recommendations!  Will be using for all trips from now on. | Please make this app compatible with Airbnb!!! It’s a pretty good app, but there seem to be a lot of minor glitches. I really like that it gives me a time frame to get from one point to the other and it creates the most seamless transition, but it is super slow and I can’t add accommodations for Airbnb. Also, once I’ve gotten rid of a box, I don’t want it to keep popping up…it’s incredibly frustrating. | Wowed by the amount of information I can find in this app. Wanderlog has asked and answered all of the questions you have about traveling, organized them and put them all in one app. SO useful!  I'm just at the tip of the iceberg and can't wait to explore more! | This app really was essential in the planning of my trip. It allowed me to make a list of all the things we wanted to do and see and then work to fill in the gaps!  I referred to it when e had some down time or looking for a place to eat nearby. | Literally the best app for planning trips. So easy to use and able to collaborate with friends! | Loved this app. It really helped me plan for a better trip as to maximize areas and sites I wanted to see. I will definitely use it from now on when planning. | Very User Friendly!  My son recommended this app and honestly I was hesitant. I normally turn to paper and pen. But boy what a revelation this app turned out to be; so convenient to have everything in one place. Loading travel plans was a breeze!  Adding places to visit was easy. Also the app provides ideas for stops. Love it. | I had plans to use this and after 1 week got a hard stop. | This app has every feature I would put into a travel planning app! I am thrilled with it! | I am really enjoying the app. It would be helpful if there was a driving map, so we don’t have to use other apps for planning. | I used this app to plan my trip to Japan and absolutely LOVED how easy it was to plan out all the restaurants, landmarks, train stations, and hotels on the map and organize everything into their own respective categories! I found it so helpful that they also auto color code the points on the map based on the category I put them in (I put them in categories of cafes, restaurants, transportation stops, etc.). I had the best trip all because I was able to add all my notes into this app, and now I send my itinerary to everyone I can and always tell my friends and family to plan everything using this app! | Wonderful app! I love to able to save all the places of interest and it auto populates in the map & numbered too. Great for organizing my days on a trip and even adding what restaurants I want to visit etc. Super helpful app and very easy to use! Love it and highly recommend it. | This app totally changed how I plan and travel!!! I am recommending it to everyone I know. We went to Berlin as a family of 5. Everyone had access to the itinerary for planning purposes. And I, as the planner, was able to put all of our trip details (and all my research) in one place, making a huge improvement in how we sightsee. This is a very robust and useful travel tool! | I have always used Roadtrippers until they started ripping people off with their prices.   I made the switch and really like using wonderlog now.   It is different from when I was used to using, but I think I like it a lot better.  I love the easy way you can keep all of your documents together in one place. | I really hate planning trips…not because I don’t enjoy picking out cool places to go, but because I struggle with things like timing and organization. This app really helped me to put together an itinerary that included all of the places I wanted to go, plus gave me a few suggestions to fill in some gaps. 

Will definitely use it for future trips! | Wanderlog is awesome for helping organize and coordinage those big trips--especially internationally. It was super useful to both plan our own daily itineraries as well as utilize the recommendations made by Wanderlog. Fantastic stuff! | Way way better than competing apps.

Easy to use and email notifications were great | I stumbled upon this app about 5 years ago before it became huge and my opinion has never changed. It’s such a great app, it’s simplistic and stays up to date as you are on the move (literally!) it is totally worth paying for in my opinion even if you don’t necessarily fly to travel,, you can still make smaller itineraries. It is one of the best apps out there! | I luv this app, it keeps my entire itinerary when I travel in one place and I get alerts through the TripIt app before the airlines send updates. It’s amazing. I highly recommend. | Have used this app for a couple of years now after trying several. I like the rate change notifications as well as changes gate changes and other reminders. Dust wish it was easier to upload travel itineraries created on ChatGPT/or other AI to track the entire vacation. | I do not find a way to contact personnel at TripIt.  Poor customer service options-currently | Not sure how this app has not been acquired by the likes of Apple or some big outfit. It is beyond AMAZING. 

Works like magic and makes checking emails for trip information a thing of the past. Don’t travel as much as I used to but when I do, TripIt is a must use app for all aspects of the trip. Lifesaver!! | Could not upload anything but airline schedule. I will go back to manually generating my schedule and itinerary.  I’m not sure if it was user error but I have given up. Great concept. | This app looks nice, but the ridiculous amount of time that I’m spending to just
• get my trip info imported from my email 
• take my phone number to push SMS messages
• to not have to enter all this info manually
•to not have to forward the info to an email to send to this app
• to figure out how to effectively refresh this app and maybe it will retrieve my flight, hotel, trip reservations..
• see that I just purchased to pro and it still has not populated my upcoming trip..

Is giving free app vibes, when I know I’ve spent money… | I have used this app for over 10 years and consider it one of my go-to apps for travel. It’s simple and easy to use. | Enjoying organizing our trips.   Amazing app.   Worth the effort to have everything organized.   Especially like having it flow to my Apple calendar | Can’t sync email. Can’t edit things within itinerary without it freezing or just not loading or giving errors…seems like it could be a great app tho | I don’t travel much but when I do I use TripIt extensively. It is extremely useful and helps keeps me on track. | Not happy with 25 pdf limitation  AT ALL.  I have a 3 week trip coming up and certain arrangements and tour details will need to be maintained outside of App. Questioning whether Trip It Pro is worth it. I love the app, but this is the main reason I upgraded and spent the money. | TripIt is awesome! I travel frequently and TripIt lets me have all the info I need right in one place without having to lift a finger. | For my trip I booked flights with several different airlines. When I edit the confirmation number for one flight, it saves that confirmation number as the new updated confirmation number for all of my flights on the trip, even though all of the confirmation numbers should be different. | Comprehensive & intuitive app! Pulls all travel plans from email. I receive notices before the airlines notices come through. | I googled for a trip organizer or some sort of reminder for events. And this app popped up. And it was the best decision ever. It made everything so much better, timing, reminders organizer itinerary. I got to do a-lot more of activities and events on my trip thanks to the app and is easy way of keeping everything including address and tickets store and at hand. | Love that it tracks my trips, airline ticket numbers, hotel confirmations, etc. but what I REALLY love is that I can look at it and immediately see when I will be out of town. Yes, that info is already in my calendar, but TripIt segregates my travel schedules in a much more accessible way. Perfect for capturing all of the other vacation/travel related items and categorizing them appropriately. When someone asks if I’m available in September, I look at TripIt first.  That provides the overview. Also, I can share all of our plans with my husband and traveling companions. And I can share my travel info with family that are not traveling, if anyone needs to contact me. Great app. | I just received an alert from TripIt saying that the price had dropped on my flight by $160. Just called the airline and got my $160 credit.

I also like that, all of my reservations are in one place car, hotel, flights. It even gives you warnings when things don’t look right. | This app not only helped me organize my trip and order the activities, but it is SO simply to get everything added! And you can share it with everyone on the trip so everyone has all the information and access to tickets, etc. I would give this app 10 stars if I could! Well done! | This is so great to plan your itinerary. | Excellent app. | Just started testing out this app to see if I want to purchase the pro version. So far it has kinks that need to be fixed before I’ll pay for it. When adding multiple flights to a single trip, it won’t allow you to have multiple confirmation numbers, even when selecting different airlines. I book a lot of separate tickets so this is very frustrating.

Updated to add that if you forward the itineraries, the confirmation numbers are correct. It only glitches if you enter them manually. | This app works the best for coordinating your vacations itinerary. Just email your confirmation s and it sorts out date time and everything. It’s especially helpful in keeping you in sync with the location time zones. Highly recommended for anyone going on trips. | Love the ease of the app. We set up a special email for tripit that we use for all trip notices that integrates with tripit. We have done 370 trips and don't plan on switching apps. I love that Pro keeps your history. I love the text alerts they keep me on the right path and saves me so much time. Everything I need for a trip is here. | Trying to access app, unfortunately crashes started to happen with notice that app is temporarily unavailable. Very disappointing. Removed/Uninstalled app and started again to try and login, same error. | I love the idea everything is in one place but It’s taking forever to add documents and keeps freezing so I have to close and restart every time | Love how it imports trip info from my email. So easy to stay on top of flights and hotels | It is so helpful and so easy to use! | This is my favorite app of all time. If you travel you need this. Easy, even for old folks to use. 10 stars. | I’ve thought this was a solid app for tracking travel plans, but had a wonderful surprise today when I received a text that my Southwest flight in 2 months was $60 cheaper (same flight) and not only told me to call to get a flight credit, but gave me the number. To say I was happy is an understatement. | Love it | Love to organize my trips on this app. Added bonus with Tripit Pro- they notify you if price changes on your flight allowing you to request refund! Love it | There are certainly areas to grow.  But, from my experience this the best and easiest app to use.  I do wish when I send confirmations for events such as concerts, sporting events, tours or excursions it would do a better job in adding to the plan with the appropriate event type. 

My wife and I share the travel planning.  This really helps us keep track of what’s been purchased and what still needs to be addressed.

 In the future I could imagine this app or a competitor leveraging machine learning and/or AI to do something special.  Probably would get purchased by one of the big players in the space like Expedia or booking.com | Love the one stop shop for tracking all my business travel

One thing. I wish that when I check into to flights it would allow me to add the boarding pass to my apply wallet, but I have to go on the website to do that, rather than TripIt. I mainly fly southwest so it may just be with that airline. | I’m having trouble importing new trip details from my emails on file. Not sure why this stopped happening. | TripIt is my favorite travel app. I don’t know how they do what they do, but they always beat the airlines when it comes to providing flight delays, cancellations, and gate change notifications. if you travel a lot, TripIt Pro definitely is worth it. | I’ve planned two trips in a few weeks. I’ve used this app and it has made them so easy. I have coordinated a trip for three people with three different airline itineraries, nightly dinner at six different locations for the week, to and from transportation and events. Talk about an easy effort, everything set up automatically and I was able to email it to the folks involved! Thank you for creating an app that actually does what it says it’s going to do and works so effectively!! | Simple and easy to coordinate hotel/car/flight information. Simple to look back and find the info as well. | I have had this app for about a year and I love, love, love it. I usually have several trips in the planning stage. This app lets me keep track of everything in one place. I easily see exactly what I have booked from flights, hotels, tours, restaurant reservations, theater performances and just about anything else. It is easy to use and edit any change of plans. I have recommended this app to friends. I am so glad I have this app. | It has been a great help to me in organizing my trips. | Oh my God I just learned about this app today and played with it for 10 minutes and it’s so helpful to organize my itinerary and saved me a lot of manual work. I’m totally impressed. | I have almost 4 million seat miles on AA.  I use this for every trip business and personal.  Saves a ton of time and it organizes everything involved in travel.  It’s awesome. | This travel app is absolutely amazing!
Create a trip and send confirmation emails to input!  Helps you catch errors, make sure you have no gaps, etc. includes all transportations, reservations, lodging etc with all the info you need in it. | Was seriously loving this app to plan a big trip with the family. Lots of planes, trains, hotels to keep track of. Once I realized the max PDF files was 3 with the free version I immediately upgraded to Pro to then only find out that they once again maxed out at 25 uploads. Geez…. It was my main reason for paying! | This is the best app ever I shared it with two friends that are not Internet savvy, and they are very excited to use this for their upcoming European trip.  My friend and I are able to share our updates and I love the expansions on each location that provides more detail that we don’t have to look up. I do wish they could add some sort of budget where you could see the total of your budget at the top or something but other than that it’s amazing. It’s a great app they can be used with, anything you’re doing on your trip and I love the chronological order | I’ve been using KAYAK for a while to plan and share trip information, but it isn’t a perfect tool, so I thought I’d try TripIt for a while. 

It is easy to add your plans to TripIt, just forward it reservation emails; Kayak does this too. You can also enter or change details manually. Tripit is somewhat better than kayak for this. 

With TripIt, it is easy to share a trip with participants who can update the trip with you (e.g. one person works on transportation, another on lodging, etc). The whole trip collaboration thing is easier with TripIt than KAYAK. 

The subscribed calendar support in KAYAK is much better than TripIt. With KAYAK you can see all your trips, including flights and lodging, on your device calendar. I can easily see how my trips fit into all my other plans. Other people can see my trips on their calendars too. I just share a calendar link with friends and family so they can see where I am and how to reach me on their own device calendars without using the kayak app at all; they like that. 

Tripit also supports subscribed calendars, but doesn’t include the detailed plans. This is a showstopper for me; it should be straightforward for TripIt to improve their support, but until they do, I’ll stick with KAYAK. | My account has an odd email added to it, and with every click I get an error. It’s been less then 10 min since downloading it and I want out | I’ve used this app for years and never cease to be impressed by how easy it makes keeping track of travel plans.  Especially because I travel a lot. | This app makes organizing travel simple. I email my confirmations to the app and it organizes my itineraries. I’ve planned complicated itineraries for a few weeks in Europe with tour guides, show tickets, hotels, drivers, trains and planes.

Links and documents are seamless from emails,  webpages, maps, pictures, anything you want to add to your itinerary is done. It is extremely user friendly, easy to update, change, delete or add something. Reservations directly from your multiple emails (including my friends) upload instantly into my itinerary. I love being able to choose my own background pictures for my trips and see them all lined up on my phone. I do wish there was a print feature and maybe a rating system for entries in old trips so i can remember which restaurants/tours etc were worth it and which to skip although i can always just put notes so I’m nitpicking. Really well done and i love not having to worry about adding too many documents or links or trips. Excellent app for travelers! | I love how I can put in items without an and time.  Having issues syncing between devices.  Don't like if you just assign a location as ""afternoon"" it will show at the bottom of the day's itinerary vs in timeline order. Parking also doesn't show on itinerary, but does have it on the main trip page.  I like it better than TripIt and Wonderlog. | I'm a longtime user of TripIt but just switched over and it's 95% of what I was using before. The one (very odd) omission is that when importing flights, for some reason Tripsy doesn't read the name of the passenger—there doesn't even seem to be a field within Tripsy to store that information. It's a very strange product choice, as it can create confusion when a single trip contains multiple flights for multiple people. I emailed the developer about this but didn't get a response. Anyway, it's not quite a dealbreaker and I'm otherwise really happy with Tripsy—a great translation of TripIt's functionality into a beautiful, Apple-native experience. | La aplicación es hermosa estéticamente. Para mí nunca funcionó porque quise compartir el itinerario, el cual me tardé demasiado capturando, para que nunca pudiera compartirlo. Me salia un mensaje que estaba sincronizando con su nube y nunca lo pude compartir. En una lástima, pero tuve que regresar a TripIt. 😔 | I am a Tripsy Pro subscriber and like this app. I use it for dozens of shared trips a year. But it has major problems with editing events. 

Half the time edits don't stick and you close out of an item and find it totally unchanged on your itinerary. 

Time zone support is also a disaster. Time changes don't stick, trips and events move around the world from time zone to time zone. There's no consistent anchor or method to handling and entering times. 

Perhaps all the problems relate to the way the app stores data. Its sync just doesn’t work well and you need to be aware that data loss can occur. Sometimes events revert to previous versions hours after a change was made. If you move an attachment from one event to another, sometimes the attachment will simply disappear; it is neither on the old event nor the new. Sometimes you simply cannot change the time of an event no matter what you do.

Usability and UI design could really use some work. | Setting an itinerary is an exercise in frustration as destination times refuse to save at least 40% of the time. When they do save, the app decides to change dates on relaunch. Needs work.

4/13 And latest update broke the widgets. Sigh | The design of the app is definitely 5 stars. Where the Tripsy is legging no live updates on flight delays or gate changes, other similar apps provide that info. | Takes so much stress out of traveling, especially with a group. Love this app and wouldn’t want to travel without it. | Tripsy is by far the most advanced and user-friendly travel planner that I've used so far and I do not know how there could be an app better. It also is a Macbook friendly app, which is a HUGE plus. Definitely recommend! | Tipsy has many positive features to organize travel. For the most part I really like the app, but there’s one glaring flaw.
When a 5:30am wake-up time becomes 3:30 am, for no good reason except that Tripsy wants to send “emergency “ notifications on the watch that a gate has been assigned or changed, the missing sleep makes this app so. Not. Worth. It.
I have my watch and phone in sleep mode. Only emergency notifications should come through. But Tripsy manages to get them buzzing me anyway. I don’t know why or how, nor can I find a setting to turn it off. II just know that I’ve lost more than a few nights of good sleep before travel due to this bug.
“Why are you wearing your watch at night?” —> sleep monitoring and afib monitoring. 
An app that is this disrespectful of the importance of sleep doesn’t deserve more than two stars, no matter how good or bad it is otherwise. | I love having all trip details in one place, and it’s made convenient to forward confirmation emails to the app and automatically on my phone calendar.  It would be useful to have a pre trip checklist of things I need to do and a place for a packing list. 

I like having a trip history to refer to later if traveling to the same place again. It would be helpful to have a section to rate the restaurant, museum, etc after to help jog my memory for recommendations or if a restaurant is worth a repeat visit. | As I sit here loading EACH and EVERY RESERVATION by Hand, MANUALLY, I absolutely wonder WHAT exactly, I am paying for????
I Can do this MUCH EASIER in my Calendar, Except for the ""supposed to be"" ease of seeing it all on one page? NOT HAPPENING, YET! 
Certainly there has to be a better way. | I am planning our anniversary trip, and I have to say this app is awesome. It not only allows me to add everything to a quick view schedule, but also allows me to add documents that I normally had to rewrite not notes on other apps. Ir can find your flights, carrier, hotel and resort! All in a nicely laid out interface. I use it on an iPad Mini and it looks awesome. | I love I can organize stuff for myself and collaborate on trips with my wife, and it supports everything. Tours, cruises, restaurants, adding files and photos, everything. And lots of clever features sprinkled throughout. Fantastic app. | I've been using TripIt (Pro) for years, but I've always found its interface cumbersome and confusing. While TripIt's new interface is better, I much prefer Tripsy for all my travel planning and tracking.  

Tripsy's clean visual design is beautiful and efficient. The main screen displays the most essential information for my trip or, when traveling, for the current leg of my journey. Details for any portion of the trip are usually just a click away. Tripsy has all the main features that you'd expect from a travel app, such as multiple ways to gather travel documents into a trip (search email, forward an email, Mac/iOS sharing, etc), integration with device calendars, support for multiple travelers and non-traveling planners, document upload, etc. TripIt still has an edge in integrations with other travel apps or services. I suspect Tripsy will add more partnerships as they grow and develop. If there is something you want or need to do in TripIt, Tripsy has the option to sync from  TripIt automatically. I used this option when I started using Tripsy, which made that initial transition (or even a trial) so much easier because I didn't need to reimport my documents for planned trips. 

Tripsy lost a few points in this review because of a few areas where it took effort to accomplish some tasks. There are some quirks in importing the cruise portion of a trip. Most cruise data was imported without a hitch; however, it didn't grab the departure time for days in port. I tried manually adding the departure times for a day in port, but it was annoyingly complex. I'd open the detail for a particular day, but I needed help figuring out how to add the departure time, or when I did, I could only choose from predetermined times. Eventually, I found that I had to select a predetermined time, save the changes, open the details again, scroll down to the proper date of my trip and then I could finally set the appropriate time. This problem doesn't happen often, but it is currently a pain. 

Overall, though, I love using Tripsy!! It is now my go-to travel app. | It really helps plan trips and only one person needs a subscription for everyone to collaborate in the app for a trip. | overall great program.  needs a slight interface overhaul (each day should be very subtle different color than others to easily differentiate them).  And I would highly recommend a calendar view. | If you have an itinerary already defined, this app may help document it.  But if you're actually planning and exploring options, it will get slow you down and make a mess in your calendar database.  Also, I got billed for a month even though I cancelled quickly. | Here are my issues so far-- 1) Multiple times, the entries I have put in and saved change on their own. Train times, for instance, will modify themselves to whatever they want (right now I have a train entry that leaves at 8:42PM and arrives at 8:42PM, despite putting in the accurate times). It is not a time change issue, either, they're just random times and AM/PM. This is very annoying and I'm about to give up on this tool. 2) We're flying halfway across the world and you have to scroll to see the map entirely, no way to zoom out and show the whole trip on the screen. You can zoom in...but you can't zoom out to show Florida and Australia on the same map screen. 3) I subscribed to a monthly plan and was surprised to have recently been charged for a year's access. It just seems like ""Save"" doesn't mean what you think it does in this app. I was really excited to get organized, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere, like TripIt. | Unable to even put in dated. Date Screen does not scroll to find the correct month. Figures a work around but once I put in the ending date, the program changes the start date so the trip is ony 1 day....unless I set the trip up without dates but it is difficult to add places for the new days. | 如果加上每段行程花费多少钱这个功能就更好了 | Tried to change to this because I was over trip it. Not pulling in the text from the email and when I search for what I need it keeps showing something in the wrong country. No thanks. Making my life harder | This product can do more to help plan for your vacation than the free platforms. Both this company and apple customer service are unwilling to listen and help resolve my issue with this platform. | This is a great travel planner APP. It works very well and is reliable. Their customer service is excellent as well. If you are looking for a travel planner APP with a lifetime purchase, just try this one! | I am offering 4-stars in this review solely based on the apps' potential and the current user interface design friendliness. The apps' current state and functionality is actually about a 2-star. I hope to update this review shortly to full 5-star based on some things getting taken care of.
Easier itinerary control - went to manually add (I didn't have easy access to the email), a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport for an early flight, and I couldn't do that because the app had already defined the trip as Thursday to Tuesday based on the flight, with me trying to add a Wednesday ""activity"". I had to go into the settings for the itinerary and change the beginning date. (A further annoyance, rather than just changing one date, once I set the new start, it also required the ending, rather than keeping it on the same by default. There should be a way when adding an activity to go “outside the dat boundary” and have the app automatically update the overall itinerary timeframe.
Side-note to above… The share-to-Tripsy function in the Hilton app only brought hotel name and phone number, not the booked dates, res# or other actual booking details - another potential fix? I don’t know if that is Tripsy not importing correctly, or Hilton not exporting & sharing properly.
Better functionality required for the planning part of a trip. Right now, this app just kind of “catches” all the emails you forward it (or painfully add in manually). When you think of booking a trip, say a vacation getaway, there are many pieces to it (the very reason for this app). Resort, flights, transport from airport to resort, excursions while there, maybe a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport with park-and-fly arrangements. Not all that stuff is booked at once. So being able to easily add in each aspect that needs to be booked, and then have each of those activity icons color-coded on the itinerary page (ie. Red for needs booking, yellow for booked, green for booked and pre-paid) really is necessary. Being able to manually change the color of each activity icon would be a simple step. More complex would be adding in 2 checkboxes in the activity (or right-click / hold-click pop up menu) to indicate when it is booked and when it is paid. Next level of complexity would be for the app to automatically color code based on the details provided in the activity (company and res # fields filled out automatically determines “booked” status, I’m not sure how it would determine paid).
 
Again, overall I like the direction this app is going, but it really needs these updates to become the true “Go-To Travel Planner”. Currently, it is leagues beyond it’s main competitor. Enough that I subscribed to Pro for a year. But without these necessary changes, that subscription will not get extended. Yes, those changes are that necessary, and without them I will go back to Excel and OneNote to manage all my travel, as the app would be missing the “ease” functionality that it should have vs. a more manual process.
Hopefully the devs read this and put these ideas in place very soon. I am sure they have a “roadmap”, but for true traveler functionality, these need to be inserted in the immediate stages of that roadmap.
Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!!! | Several of my trips that are complete on one device are showing up as one-day trips on days where I don’t have travel planned. For example, if I have a trip planned from 11-17 March, the trip shows up as 25-25 March on other devices and shared links. None of the activities are syncing across devices. Reached out to support several weeks ago but haven’t heard back and the issue still hasn’t been fixed. Just know that paying for the premium features is worth it when it works, but if it stops working you’ll be dealing with awful customer support. I’ve also never been able to get the import function to work. I like the interface though. | 地图可以增加高德和百度吗？以及板块如果可以自定义就好了，比如我，只想用 app 收集餐馆。旁边的证件对我来说没什么用。我相信有这样需求的人也不少。

""Can maps include options for Amap (高德) and Baidu (百度)? Additionally, it would be great if users could customize categories. For example, I might only want to use the app to collect information about restaurants, and licenses nearby are not relevant to me. I believe there are many users with similar needs."" | A great app that keeps all your travel plans in one place. A suggestion - would you please consider adding a feature that allows me to set to-do reminders for my trip? It would would be so helpful to be able to set a reminder then later received a push notification. Thank you!! | I was a long time TripIt user and Tripsy is better in every way imaginable | I had been searching for a good itinerary app ever since Google Trips shut down years ago. Tripsy is the best one I've used since then. The auto-import by email (for flights, hotels, cars etc) works great and has only gotten more reliable over the year I've been using it. The iOS and Mac apps are both super easy to use and visually appealing. | have you considered adding a ""packing list"" feature for our trips? | This is a great app. I have used it on multiple trips and I can’t live without it now. The only thing missing is that I would like a way to keep a packing list with a quantity field. So I can always make sure I have everything ready prior to a trip and before a return. | Sadly, was hoping this would be app that might work to share itinerary with other humans traveling with me without them having to buy. Nope. Also, had to manually enter 4 of 6 flts and 1 hotel. Even when trying to share from hotel app to create event had to manually enter data. All of this would be fine but when share itinerary with others it does not provide any details (times of flights, flt #, resv etc | Just got it and it provides no guidance as to how to use the app, how to upload reservations; adding guests seems impossible.... | This app is pretty good and very helpful. However I wish the native Mac app felt more Mac-like. As it is, it feels very much like a big iPhone app. I was hoping that planning my trip and making adjustments would have been much easier on my Mac, but I feel the UI and workflow is very limited since it feels like it is a scaled up iPhone app that does not adequately take advantage of the Mac. It is very good, but I wish it could better take advantage of what the Mac can allow for productivity! | Good app and looking forward to using it for future trips.  Would greatly appreciate a field for cost/expense.  We like to work withina budget and this would greatly help. | Searching and adding a flight is too clunky, taking too many steps. The whole UI feels huge like the buttons are massive, but it doesn't make it more usable. You can have different dates than your flights and it doesn't auto update the actual trip dates. You can accidentally add the same flight twice. Buttons aren't labeled, making the intended flow unclear. Basically feels like a more manual version of Kayak, since I'm not paying for the pro version so I can't do email sync. | I download Mac App and iPhone app. At first I ran into problem where the trip from Mac app does not sync. I email support and the Co-Founder responded to me and help diagnose the issue really fast. In face I never had this fast response from app developer before. And the step to diagnose and communication this is straightforward and sincere.

Apart from that, the app has intuitive user interface and easy to understand and can sync with multiple devices and with friends whom I shared the trip with. This eliminated the need to manually create initerary, which reduce times and free us to explore the activities instead. | Wowww. What a good travel app. Very easy going and with all the information and set up for the best experience travel management | I decided to try the app out because I'm looking for an app that can handle travel planning and has a nice UI, which this one does. 

However I noticed while creating an account that the form fields aren't labeled correctly so you can't auto-generate a password from Keychain.This is coming from a developer so I know how easy it is to integrate those small security features in form fields. This was the first red flag. 

So I made a temporary password and I thought I'd change it afterwards to a more secure password, but there's no option to change my password in the app? I read the other reviews about the support being non-existent, along with the developer not responding to feedback in the app store reviews makes me not trust the construction of this app, or being able to get basic support if something goes wrong (keep in mind this app has paid features). I just deleted the app after deleting my account. | The interface is beautiful but the actual implementaion is terrible. Tried several times to add an event and itinerary and it never showed up. I might have even duplicated the subscription in trying to fix the issue. My reccomendation is to go with TripIt. Not as pretty but it works. | Pro user here for a few years now. I absolutely love the planning aspect but the number of unresolved bugs is incredibly frustrating. Support is nonexistent, you won’t get an answer for weeks. There are issues with timezones, findings things, flight schedules, sync and many others. Each update breaks something. I am really unhappy at this point and will not renew our subscription next year. | A really solid travel organization app. All the nice features you want. If you travel it’s easily worth the subscription price. | I love this app and use it constantly. It has been a game changer for me. Very much appreciate the regular improvements. | I would have probably signed up for the paid service and enjoyed the app. However, I found a charge on my card via my apple account before ever using the app. Canceled subscription. | I have used this app twice this year - a two week trip to Spain, and a five week road trip of the east coast of the united states.  In both cases, I found myself a slave to the app. The cost of setting up parts of a trip, in terms of effort, was much greater than the benefit I got from it. I put this app in a drawer and only pulled it out occasionally. I am happy to let this infernal subscription expire until I MAYBE want to use it again in two years.

I like the app, kinda. It looked good at first. It is good at organizing itineraries, as long as those itinerary are AirBnB and organized tours and have a rigid order that will NEVER change. Other parts of my travel plan, like mapping, seem forced and clunky. I had to find ways to do these outside this app.

After a while I started treating this app as a wallet that held a collection of ideas. Adding and removing things from the itinerary took WAY too much effort. Items simply didn't like to move.

I guess I am not their target market. It is too much of a marginal benefit for me keep paying for. It would be worth a fixed charge with paid upgrades, but this is in no way such a life-changing app that I want to keep paying and paying for it. A folder with a collection of links and copies of my reservations works just as well.

Subscription cancelled. | It does not sync with phone and laptop and my phone is missing trips that i put on my laptop!
PLEASE FIX BECAUSE I LOVE THIS APP IF IT WOULD SIMPLY JUST DO THAT | I've been looking for something like Tripsy for a long time.  the closest thing has been tripit but Tripsy seems setup to add the functionality to be the travel suite everyone will use.  It does a pretty good job parsing emails but my AirBB reserveration didnt work. There doesnt seem to be an option for it monitor emails automatically.   It would be nice to be able to drag items from one day/time to another.   The search functionality for new evetns works well.   I love the map feature.  The whole app is worth it for this feature.    Support has been super responsive.  I'm looking forward to growing with them.  Finally theyre doing what no one else could. | I only see, weekly, monthly and yearly as option but not lifetime | Such a great app - but I wish it had 2 small things:

1. The ability to hide flight paths on the map view. I dont want the map to always default to a zoomed out view that doesn’t show many much relevant detail of the stuff I have planned in my actual destination 

2. The ability to add a location to the itinerary on a certain day, without having to assign it a specific time. I.e. “I want to go here on the second day of my trip, but I don’t care specifically

Most contents in the app just wouldn’t load. Nearly unusable. | Planning a trip to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown Ky and the Creation Museum in Petersburg Ky.  Neither available. 

So not very helpful for us trying to plan a vacation. Will try again someday. | I used this app in Paris, great. However, when I tried to use it in Portland ME, I could not find Portland Head Light, one of the oldest lighthouses in America, commissioned in 1791 by George Washington. There is no way to add manually. We can only add what’s already there. Need to update please. | Very short overview.   Limited content. | If you’re into 70%+ of their posts being TikTok videos that they share, along with nondescript titles or descriptions, cool I guess. But that’s literally all it is, along with the thumbnails/ previews all being broken. 
Trash. | It won’t let me change “searching in xx” if I try to switch the card pulls up from bottom of screen then immediately goes back down. Unable to swap and use a big portion of the app’s functionality. | It has a really nice interface, easy information at a glance! It’s really helpful and I can see myself using it in the future. It doesn’t have Istanbul, which is my upcoming trip, though. Would be nice! Thanks, lots of potential! | It seemed easy at first. I want to have hotels, museums and restaurants in my itinerary. The app couldn’t locate one restaurant. Also, I set up an itinerary and the app lost all the information so I would have to start over. | Like the idea. Unfortunately it is Very buggy. I can’t search what I want. And the design is not very intuitive | Don’t bother, this app is designed to serve ads and collect personal info in exchange for doing basic google searches. | Great idea and app, has great potential if the searches were more up to date | Literally just an app for bookmarking travel spots.  Obvious features that would make it far more useful such as notes, personal ratings, and being able to jointly share itineraries are missing. | I cannot recommend this app. The last update wiped my itinerary!

I feel dumb for not taking screenshots of each day.

It just refers you to other articles and links filled with advertisements.

I heard a lot of good things about this app, so I just downloaded it the other day and I’ve been immediately bombarded with 30+ notifications per day. I just looked to see if there was a way to personalize what kind/how many notifications you get and there doesn’t appear to be any options for it. It’s either you get spammed with notifications all day, or you don’t get any at all.

Those experiences are provided by independent organizations and people and not by Viator.

The app itself is very poorly designed. I wanted to search for tapas tours in Barcelona. If you just enter Barcelona you get 1000s of events, 99% of which are not tapas. You can filter by type of event but it wasn't all that helpful.

So, you try searching for ""Barcelona tapas"" directy. This gives you a list of one line each results. You click on and then want to check another result. So you click back but this takes you all the way to the top of the app, not back to the search results. So you click search again and now you have to manually enter ""Barcelona tapas"" again because the search history only shows the one result you picked, not the search terms you entered? Now you have to try to remember where you left off. Why don't the search results look exactly like the city results???

Other issues include that nothing is copyable. Needed to copy the address. not copyable. Description had urls in it of sites and apps related to the event. They are neither clickable nor copyable so you have to manually memorize them and type them into the browser or app being referenced.

It feels like the problem is the company had fooled itself by the high ratings. Those ratings are not for Viator itself though | We’re seniors and this is our first and most likely our last visit to DC. The convenience of reviewing, selecting and booking tours with Viator is so stress free! | Thank you,
 love being a repeat customer, I feel like you take care of me personally . | I was lucky enough to have a private tour with the very lovely and informative Roy. I enjoyed hearing all about the history of the temples, the mountains and his life here in Cambodia. Highly recommend Roy! | I’m deleting the app as Viator sells me tickets for tomorrow despite my filter for today.  Then, the are worthless in getting you a refund.  

I’ve spent thousands with this app but they put all of the work on their customers while they just step back and count the money.  Zero customer service.
  
Be careful to triple check that date before you purchase. | Even though the code was good through in of month it would not give me the 10 % on the new download app | I love using the Viator app. It’s easy to navigate, has great photos, and quick access to honest reviews. Thank you for making travel even more fun! | After chatting with a rep ,
Imputing my info and cc number numerous times,
I was told to try a different cc. That produced the same result. Then it was suggested I wait 72 hours and try again. As far as holding the time of the tour we selected , they could not guarantee it. In spite of all that I tried one last time , and was successful. 
I hope it’s smooth sailing from now on! | I installed this app two days ago and I am about to delete it. Tried searching for bioluminescent kayak tours near Orlando knowing there are some out near Melbourne and it gives me results way out in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. When I change the search term to “bioluminescent Kayak tours near me“ I got zero results. | We just returned home for a two week trip in central America. We use Hector as a day car tour guide  when we visited San Salvador city

 he was prompt, and on time, picked us up at the hotel, clean vehicle was very passionate about the city and sharing all his inside knowledge as a local that actually lives on site, can’t say enough good things about Hector and his service 

The only downside it goes through violator and a third-party, which kind of garbles the communication on the front end, but we were able to crack the code and get the vouchers and everything sorted out the day of the actual tour | What a great site! I travel all around the world and this is so simple and organized!  The “booking.com” for activities!! | Thank you 🐴🤍♠️ | I recently booked the Albir, Altea, Benidorm & Calpe: Guadalest & Algar Excursion through Viator, and I must say, it was a huge letdown. The troubles started with the lack of accurate information provided by Viator regarding the meet-up point. Despite my efforts to clarify the meet-up location by calling, emailing, and texting a day before the tour, I received no response whatsoever.

On the day of the tour, the meet-up point had apparently been removed without any notice. Not even the digital ticket contained updated information. This lack of communication and support from Viator left me stranded and frustrated.

To exacerbate matters, when attempting to contact the tour company, they rudely informed me that it wasn't business hours, despite it being the day of the tour. When they finally did answer, they were unhelpful and dismissive, insisting that the information was in an email. However, I had proof through emails that the information they claimed to have sent was not provided.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply dissatisfied. Both Viator and the tour company displayed a lack of responsibility and poor customer service, making for a thoroughly disappointing and frustrating experience. | I love booking excursions with Viator. App is easy to navigate through and I find some great excursion in all places I have been to within and outside the United States. We used Viator for New Orleans, New York, Alaska ,  Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Dubai, Cartagena Columbia, Nashville and have never been disappointed! | I tried to contact customer support and our tour guide for 1.5 hours. The tour guide never showed and we received no information from customer support on the app or via email. | When I am promoted to login, viator does not return to the item I was in the middle of booking. | We loved the tours in Mexico City, but the app wasn’t as great. It pushed us to email and web browsers for tickets. | Booked tickets to Catacombs in Paris and Absolutely ridiculous how many hoops I had to jump through on this site that made me download app to prompt me get my tickets- then as soon as I downloaded, logged in with at least 2 email confirmations & a puzzle to solve, my tickets was a voucher to present at the site. Waste of 20 min of my time and highly annoying you have to do anything now days with an app. I’m using this once & deleting it. | Planning our excursions while in Greece was very easy and the customer service was amazing. | The app no longer takes passwords, requires email link which doesn’t work. Works fine in safari but forget using the app if you need to login. | Signed up for a number of experiences using the Viator website. So far so good. But when going to retrieve the tickets got caught in a maddening do-loop of “you must open the app to retrieve your tickets “ but app refuses to log me in once the emailed confirmation is complete. Finally found a way to download a pdf to myself after about an hour of frustration | Booked an overnight transfer from our hotel to the airport for a 7am flight. This was done the day before.
We didn’t have the option to select the pickup time which was worrying, and didn’t get a confirmation or anything. We realized that we needed to add a third person to our reservation so we called the transportation company(since viator doesn’t let you update anything)… and they tried to fix it. While on the phone, I asked them what the pickup time was since I still didn’t have an email and they said they would let me know within 30 minutes, since they hadn’t found a driver yet. The flight was 10 hours out, at this point…

An hour later, I got an email saying that the transport company was canceling the order because they couldn’t pick us up at 4am, and that we needed to book with “overnight transfer”, which was what we had selected to begin with. I believe that if we hadn’t called to add a person, we wouldn’t have heard anything until after the flight.

Viator now says they can’t refund our order because the time already passed. | The app is convenient but you’ll pay a 200% markup or more for tickets! | Fast and accurate. | Jalisa was our knowledgeable private tour guide at the Museums of American History and Natural History Museum.  She helped us enjoy and get up close to many interesting exhibits and brought them to life for us with her stories. We highly recommend this tour. | The authentication process is a loop of an email link to opening the app with tells you to log in which sends you an email which opens the app that tells you to log in. Over and over. | Easy to navigate. But should have deal button to browse quickly and add coupons for customers. | I rarely review apps but not sure how this one is at 5 stars. You can’t see vouchers in their app, there are tours where they won’t tell you the pick up point and sometimes for refunds they will ask you to talk to the tour operator.

Unreal. Better apps out there. Avoid. | I have booked several tours with this organization, and the tours are always great. In addition to great tours, their customer service and responsiveness is amazing. I will always use them. | I have used ViaTour in several different countries, including Australia/NZ, Europe and Asia, and have never been disappointed. On the few occasions I had had to cancel, the process was easy and full refund was received within two days. | Looks like it has some great activities but you can’t sign up as a single person, 2 is the lowest number of people in any of the tours I looked at. | My ticket ended being scheduled for a week after my planned one, not only the operator noticed when I asked for help neither they will refund you or allow you to use the $$ in a different tour. I didn’t even wanted the money but the tickets in a different day | The app itself is super handy, but it’s hobbled by its inability to add events to your calendar unless you let it have full calendar access. There is absolutely no reason this app needs to be able to READ every event on my calendar other than to collect and sell my private data. iOS allows you to set calendar permissions to “Add Events Only,” but the app won’t add events with that option selected. There’s no excuse for that. | In my opinion it is wrong for a company to block reviews they don't like under the excuse of ""community standards.""
I'm not alone. Read the most recent reviews. Lots of 1 stars. | Poor | Haven't gone wrong yet.  Great guides and always fun.  Have made new friends. | Book through any other travel site, and you will find a better price. Just test it for yourself and see that [Viator] has a huge markup. Further, when you send them quotes from other sites showing the better price, [Viator] will still refuse to match the price, even though it’s in their guarantee. | Having same issues as most recent review from Geoz777. Go into the app and it sends a link to email. Email link opens in browser and the app doesn’t recognize that the link has been opened, making it impossible to actually sign into my account on the app. 

Note to developers - maybe use a 4 digit code sent to the email that can be manually entered into the app for confirmation. The link thing clearly isn’t working as intended. | Got the app. It asks for my email. Then sends a link. I click on the email and it takes me to the browser version of the site. It recognizes me as a past customer. Then there is a link to the app.  Click on that link and it asks for my email. Start all over and can’t get out of the loop. Tried help but no links to customer service. 😵‍💫 | helped me book a fun affordable excursion for my trip ! | It will not work if you try to only allow access to add to calendar. It wants full access to your calendar. This is too invasive. Tours are easy to book and manage though, other than that | If your experience goes well then the app is great. I called support for help with a booking for them only to screw it up and cause additional problems. 

I was charged a different amount then the confirmation email and spoken with multiple people to try to resolve. I have received plenty of emails asking for reviews, which I have left. 
Activity: good
Viator support experience: terrible

I even asked for someone to contact me and have not been contacted. I spoke with someone today who was able to refund the difference of the cost to the correct amount on my confirmation email. 

If your still reading my advice: avoid 3rd party apps like this and book directly from the source | I used the website and app twice in Hawaii and in DC. The recommendations and descriptions have worked out each time. Enjoyed each tour and trip without a mishap. I always recommend it since. | We have always recommended and used Viator. | If you don’t know , this island can be expensive ,  but with this app I found all the amusement i was interested in for a very low exciting price so thank you so much for being so convenient towards my fun factor and my wallet. Also I  earned some dollar rewards towards my next purchases. That’s Awesome  , I’m enjoying this app and taking full advantage for my future adventures. 👍👍👍👍👍 | I booked a hot air balloon ride in Mexico City to see the pyramids in November. The tour company called me the night before to inform me I needed to reschedule. I could not as I was on travel and I requested a refund immediately. 

They didn’t answer for about a month so I disputed the claim on my card. Viator proceeded to fight (and won) my dispute and I’m now stuck with just under $500 in charges for services I didn’t receive. I’m never using this service again. | Major Bug

Very inviting. Smells good. Comfy beds. | Expedia? Or One Key? Or what?
Signed in, but need to sign in again?
Horrible experience | When buying a ticket late. It’s all good. | If you are looking for peace of mind , don't ever book through Expedia..
They as overall perspective is not responsive..i was surprised to see that they don't have flights on their app for certain destinations..😏😏😏😏i Booked few trips but I understood now they are overall poor and don’t want to improve or take feedback , they ll just revert through automated emails or standard formats.. | Unable to sign up and unable to get to my booking.
I would give you a negative star! | Very nice, clean hotel with comfortable beds/pillows. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Plus the location was perfect! Downtown without being right on Broadway, which helps for noise since it is rockin all night. Highly recommend! | Excelente | This app does very little to help with canceled flights or complications while traveling. Generally speaking, it’s very difficult to get help from Expedia. It’s easy to book (give Expedia your money) but anything else besides that is painstakingly horrible. If an airline cancels your flight, Expedia simply gives up and says call the airline. | When and where I love this app | The new rewards system is garbage. Between here and hotels.com I’ve spent tons of money and only got 44$ in rewards. I book all my hotels through here or hotels.com and I can assure you that once I burn through the rewards i have left till be using another travel booking system. | I booked three rooms. I received confirmation for 2 but not the third. I sought help. I received an inadequate response and then the typing in the chat was disabled. Now I have no way to resolve this issue. I just spent over 6k and I cannot get any help. | Did not help. did not give me what I requested. something as simple as the customer service phone number. why is that so difficult, I shouldn’t have to explain to a virtual agent what I wanna talk to real person about. | way to many glitches, i can barely use the app | Five Stars ⭐️ | I had a piece of metal in my meal onboard Korean Airline flight 36 on April 10 2024. I was taking a holiday to celebrate my birthday and the airline failed. They served me metal in my food that broken several crowns and I ended up swallow it. I had to run into the bathroom to go it up the metal so it didn’t cause a blockage or perforation in my intestines or bowel. Which could have been fatal. The airlines nonchalant attitude could have killed me. The airline sent me an email stating they MAY or may NOT pay for the damages. I wasn’t even offered a complimentary upgrade or anything. NEVER FLY KOREAN AIRLINE, or do so at your own risk. I will be speaking with an attorney when I get back to the states. This just isn’t right! | My Expedia hotel reservation was not found while checking in by front desk which made my experience very frustrating. Front desk was able to locate a room at an affiliated hotel for us. I will think twice before going through Expedia again. | Expedia use to have great customer service….not so much anymore! | We really enjoyed our chalet, it was immaculate, comfortable, with beautiful view.  Jane was nice and gave us a warm welcome.  Highly recommended stay. | Not working | This App has given me so much trouble tried to book a trip and it kept telling me no matter how many times I changed the flight the fare wasn’t available to change it. Finally I changed the whole destination and American Airlines triple charged me keeping me from booking my hotel and flight home. COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT | The place was amazing perfect for my stay.
It made the perfect intro to doing sound healing event’s in town near balboa park, the room was very spacious made the stay that more enjoyable, parking was good, that have a parking in garage option, coffee, tea etc.. I want to definitely keep this place on favorites.. | Very horrible customer service agents do not give calls when requested and basically are uneducated on refund policies . I was given 3 completely different answers on my refund by 3 different agents and one of them basically lied to me as they insisted and I have photos of our conversation of the Expedia agent telling me to call British airways that they have a credit for me under my name yet the two times I spoke with British airways they said they refunded Expedia and Expedia needs to refund me so on my 2,000 $ ticket I am left so far dry with no refund for my return leg which I could not take and  I am going nuts because  hate Expedia customer agents only chat and when I ask for a phone call I get nothing and they give me wrong answers as well . I need a lawyer | I booked a trip to NY because my daughter was giving birth on April 25 so I booked a flight on April 24 and return on April 28 My daughter had complications and they were delivering her a week earlier I called Expedia customer service which was horrible it took about an hour just to figure out how to talk to a human being I informed them that I went to airport and worked with delta and they did a credit and it cost an extra 100 to change no problem they got me on next flight out on Wednesday I called Expedia to change my return flight after I already called Frontier airlines and they said I had to talk with Expedia because i booked with them I called Expedia finally got a human and they did absolutely nothing I just wanted to thank you from bottom of my heart for being so heartless in a customer s time of need I hope u go out of business for your horrible customer service and for not even contacting a person at frontier and seeing how we could work something out I’m telling everyone I know friends family social media how u work thanks for making a crazy week of my life even worse | I love this app all my trips I always book through this app is the best I highly recommend. | The Expedia App does not work well. 
You can’t get anything done. You can’t even sign in. | I had to make a change to a car rental pickup & dropoff times for a pre paid rental. First, you can’t modify thru the app. Then I call the rental car company who tells me they can’t modify it cus it’s prepaid. Can’t cancel it either. Then I call Expedia “Customer Service”. I get some guy in India, & it takes over 30 minutes to get the 1st reservation cancelled, get a new reservation with the correct pickup & dropoff times. I get an email after getting off the phone confirming the new reservation only to find that the guy made the new reservation with a different company!! 
Unbelievable. This was the 1st & last time using Expedia. | Expedia doesn’t respond to you. We were charged for carry on. We had free checked bags. They told us at the check in they were fine. Then, they held us up and the departure checking our bags. Plus… they charged us $40 each for the carry on. This makes about as much sense as we dealt with boarding. United airline employees are definitely union workers. You can tell by their, “I don’t really care attitude”. | The first airplane was nice with tv the second one no tv no way to charge ur phone | First time ever visiting Kalamazoo Michigan. Great hotel. Great stay. However we were told if we needed water we could call to get more. Called for more water on day one. Didn’t get any. Called for water on day two and was told that they were busy cleaning rooms but would surely get water to the room. No show! I was disappointed. I would stay at this hotel again but I’ll bring my own water! | La peor aerolinea que he usado en toda mi vida, no merece ni una sola estrella, pesimo servicio y un costo excesivo y manipulado de tu equipaje, un robo es la mejor palabra a usar | Staff was friendly and helpful. Shower was amazing. Restaurant was good food. Lovely place, highly recommend!! | Doesn’t work to book stays! | Expedia is not helpful once it has sold you a product or service. Their trip insurance is useless. They are impossible to get in touch with if you need help. Their service representatives do not speak English as a first language. I try never to use Expedia. | I like this app | I bought ticket and messed up my departure and arrival location and they won’t refund my money | Find website in English? | Worst. Will never ever book again | Don’t use this app they offer insurance for your flights and when you want to cancel or change don’t want to do it. | Kinda slow… kinda awkward…  but I’m used to it by now. | I have used Expedia for all my travel arrangements. Expedia always has comparable rates if not better. Everytime Expedia lines up my flight, hotel and car rental my trips have gone smoothly and I have never had a bad experience. I would recommend Expedia to friends and family knowing that they will  also enjoy their vacation or if a business trip know that Expedia will be reliable in setting up their trip also. | My flight with Botswana Air was canceled several weeks prior to fly flying to Johannesburg South Africa. At no point in time did Expedia notify me that the flight was canceled. I found out through a friend who booked with booking.com. Because of this I had to book another flight with air link. 

Multiple times I contacted Expedia and confirmed with air Botswana that my flight to and from maun was cancelled. They said Expedia had to write them and confirm the refund. Expedia for months now has give me the run around. The air Botswana flights never took place. Air Botswana confirmed before and after the trip that those flights were cancelled and yet Expedia will not get me my refund. 

Basically at this point they have stolen $415 from me. Crooks I will never use them again. | Make it easier to get ahold of live support | When ever i check it says something wrong from our site try again later?! | Says a lot about Expedia following communism. I will no longer support this company. | No help at all! Let me book a hotel that was closing before my trip and now I have not seen my refund. Not a happy camper! This app is no help! | The Expedia app doesn’t remove information regarding itineraries that have been canceled, which makes it confusing if you’re trying to reschedule a trip that has similar dates, etc.. | Please don’t ever use Expedia for booking anything they don’t help out with any issues that they caused. You’re better off booking flights and hotels on your own. Otherwise they will ruin your trip. | I want to inquire about changing a reservation on May 7 from Atlanta to SFO. There is no phone number to talk to a live person.  And navigating the site is difficult. | Our room was on the east side 3rd floor. View of the bay and mountains. Very quiet room, comfortable bed. Great breakfast, everything one could want. | I had been using the Expedia app for years and very satisfied with it. It has always been my first stop. But find it unusable since about a year. It crashes almost ALL the time, you have to do 5 quizzes to to prove you are a human before you can get on. It takes longer to return any result, and if you try to look at a hotel closer, or sort airfares more than once it is certain to crash.

It does not only gives you a detailed plan for attractions in cities - which is just a start, you can find the closest hotels, add your flight; customize your routes and find any activities as well. You can switch it to Google map as well. I’m so impressed with this app and really is “The” travel cọmpanion. | Nowy has many useful features, including AI-powered travel itinerary generation, hotel booking, and flight booking. Although I don’t have any travel plan at the moment, I can create and share future plans with my family and friends. Additionally, it’s easy to edit! | OMG this is such a game changer! They used AI to help me journal my past trips too and never thought it can be such an easy and fun way to journal my trips. I have been using Nowy to plan my trips and now I can journal past trips as well. It makes me wanna travel more! | Finally found a travel app that I can search any cities and even small destinations in Brazil and Mexico. It’s amazing, easy to use, great idea and cute pages. The best thing I like is the AI can keep recọmmending different hidden gems besides what you already had in the existing itinerary. Simply amazing! | It is really great and does everything I need. It’s perfect for organizing trip details and plan everything together.  I personally love it and worths 5 stars | I loves traveling and exploring new places but always struggles with planning. I can’t believe how this app is so easy to get a planning for you. Definitely recọmmend this app to anyone who wants to simply your travel. | I am so happy to have found Nowy! I used to spend so much time with vacation planning, but Nowy does it all for me in just a few minutes. Plus, I can book flights, hotels, and activities all in this app! No need for 10 different apps or websites anymore. Highly recommend Nowy!!! | I was booking a last minute trip to Amsterdam and decided to try Nowy to help me plan. Let’s just say, I am so impressed! It helped us find a last minute hotel one stop from the main station for a really good price. It also gave us suggestions of where to eat, what museums to attend and planned out the days with efficient travel routes. Some of the highlights of my trip that Nowy’s AI assistant suggested were: the Heineken Experience, the body museum, and a nighttime canal cruise to Amsterdam during the winter light festival (which was our favorite). It also gave us some great suggestions of local places where the locals eat. I can’t wait for my next trip! | I used to use Google Drive and sheet to plan out my trips. I NO longer need to do so.
This is app has made our trip planning so easy especially while planning a 10 day road trip from Las Vegas to Arizona and Utah! The itinerary has all the website, photos and addresses everything. Surprisingly we can see our live location inside the our trip and know the distance to the next stop!

After we finished the trip and organized the final itinerary, I found the itinerary can be shared completely to our friends and see the full itinerary by the share link! This is amazing and I don’t need to send Doc any more. What a life saver!

So good and helpful! | I was trying to plan a 3-day trip to Tokyo, and the AI generated a decent itinerary based on my preference. I shared the itinerary with my friend, and it got us started on planning out the Tokyo trip!! Highly recommend it to anyone looking to save time when planning trips. I hope the app will automatically find me the best deals based on my finalized itinerary. | I’ve been searching for an app that’s user friendly and aesthetic to journal my trips and after using Nowy for a while I know this is it! The app is easy to navigate through and has many great options to customize your trips the way you want. On top of that, I can search what fun locations are near me to explore. As a lazy but eager traveler, this feature has pushed me to go outside more. There’re new features coming out continuously to create better user interfaces. I absolutely love it! | This is an awesome app, great idea, very useful for travel and provide a lots of information.

- Book Hotels - We’ve implemented the ability to book hotels directly in Pogo. No need to leave the app.
- Hotel Liking - Hotel research has never been easier. Like a hotel? Simply swipe it to the right in the list or double tap a hotel in Map View.
- Offline Mode - Upon opening Pogo for the first time on this version, a copy of your Pinboards will be kept on your phone so you don’t need Wifi/Data to access all your Pinboards when travelling.
- Bug fixes - As usual we’ve also done some other bug fixes that have been kindly fed back to us from our users. Thank you all for you feedback, it helps a lot.

Please feel free to get in touch with us at hello@pogo.travel with your thoughts or feedback. We love hearing from you and we’re working hard on implementing all the features you guys are eager to have in Pogo.

Until next time,

The Pogo Team","7.1.3",0,"USD",true,1470248251,"Pogo Travel Ltd","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/pogo-travel-ltd/id1470248251?uo=4","https://pogo.travel/",4.78054,"With the new app update I have lost my existing boards sadly. | I’ve tested out a couple of different trip planning apps and I really like the idea of Pogo the best so far, but I’ve been playing around with it for about 10 min and have had to close it out and reopen at least 5 times because it freezes. Has a lot of potential, but definitely needs work! Hope it improves quickly! | I love and miss the layout and design of pluto i was obsessed! But pogo is good as well! I love the detail and i love planning trips with this app! | The idea is there and I love the search and find option but the app is slow and anytime I click to view a category the app freezes or restarts. You’d think that exiting the app would fix that problem, but it’s just rinse and repeat and still freezes when trying to view the categories. Which really makes it more hassle than what it’s worth. | THE REBRAND IS SO BAD, I’m devastated. Pluto was one of my favorite apps and I can’t stand using the new version. The old branding was unique, beautiful and had character, not to mention the usability and functionality was also amazing. Was this rebrand tested with literally any users?? It could not have gotten positive responses. | Sorry, but the new branding is horrendous. I LOVED the old Pluto, and had it proudly on my home screen. The new logo, name, everything is so awful I’m tempted to delete the app altogether. I know rebranding takes time, effort, and money, but this was not the way to go, in my honest opinion. It feels like a cheap imitation of a popular social app, instead of embracing the unique beauty that was the old app. | I am not sure how this app received so many great reviews. It was very difficult to navigate. the flow didn’t make sense. I just was not impressed overall. | Tbh I never write reviews especially for an APP 💀BUT I’m planning a road trip soon and super exited so I wanted something to help keep me organized ✨it’s actually pretty good and cute and neat it’s like Pinterest in a way . I’m not a bot either :) thanks Pluto ! | The aesthetic of this app is incredible. 

One HUGE thing I wish it had is an actual
itinerary in date/time order. You can save everything in this app but it won’t show you a timeline like other travel apps do. 
Add that and a widget for your home screen, and I wouldn’t need any other app for travel. 

Unfortunately right now it doesn’t work 100% alone for me, I still use TripIt for the itinerary timeline feature. | I was looking for an app that would allow me to collaborate trip ideas with my friends. With very few reviews, I was uncertain, but decided to give Pluto a try and I’m so glad I did! 
So far the user experience is top notch. The app is running very smoothly, no lags or glitches. It’s very intuitive and user-friendly, and in minutes I was easily able to navigate myself around, start a trip and invite my friend to collaborate. 
A few suggestions:
When initially walking through the first steps, I would like to be able to pick a region to travel, not just a specific state or city. For instance, I wanted to be able to say Pacific Northwest, but that wasn’t an option. Also, I would like to be able to create my own categories within the trip. 

Solid five stars for usability and of course that it’s free. | i’ve been on the hunt for a travel/itinerary app that was easy on the eyes and incredibly user friendly! | I normally look at Pinterest or YouTube to look up things to do. I love that they already have popular things to try. | Awesome app for planning our holiday! there were lots of things I look for - but until now, I haven’t seen them all in one place. 
The app is very easy to use. You can also save ideas and places to eat. 
And also it served you up inspiration from the app’s recommendations. Top marks! | This app is off to a great start, they definitely have more to add, but I’m enjoying the flexibility and functionality they have now. It’s allowed me to share the plan with my friends and family going on a trip together. Also it allowed us to collaborate on the plan so that everyone has input on what we are doing on the trip so no one feels left out. | The app crashes as soon as you open it",4.78054,442,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2b/ae/ee/2baeee35-400f-691a-338f-212f45d36e55/4a1510bf-e8c4-418f-9632-8e5307164337_Pinboard_-_Slide_1_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/45/c6/49/45c649bc-0fb6-266d-6c63-704dd14f8ab2/463904db-0c02-400a-8a6a-89fc962cee89_MapView2_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6a/f7/c0/6af7c04f-56b9-43fb-d2d1-66e8e14156bc/e74af584-e6e7-4c33-93f7-2b7f31fef97f_Stays_-_Slide_3_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/00/f1/cb/00f1cbe0-ad83-14aa-e8ce-0f2bd9ba786e/ba7467e5-66e1-45d6-92a5-1368ce83c289_Recommend_-_Slide_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/53/b2/89/53b28973-0ba8-a4d2-c6da-7cd49f2f2022/a063b10a-0b5c-49d1-a356-3cfa24810af6_Reviews_-_Slide_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The hotel accommodation were truly a five star experience.  Upon our arrival the smiles were warm and welcoming. The staff provided us with transportation immediately upon request and breakfast was outstanding. This was our first experience in South East Asia and truly left a lasting impression. | It was a wonderful excursion. We enjoyed all of it. From the mountain views to the monastery it was all an experience. | Great tour to Mt. Rainier. Stopped at a number of sites. Our guide Cory was great! | We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the Vatican with Ella of LivTours!   She was warm, friendly and very knowledgeable with history, art appreciation, and religion (and has a background in archeology!).  If you can afford to go with a small group, do it!  We felt our small group tour was very personal, very pleasant and extremely informative. We saw so many large groups, and we could see the experience was not the same. | This hotel was top of the line for courteous and friendly personnel. The grounds and interior were immaculate and the relaxing atmosphere made the stay outstanding. The choices of food and drinks at the various eateries on site allowed us to enjoy the amenities and not have to leave to locate great dining elsewhere. It was worth every cent we spent. We took home wonderful memories of our experiences here. | I used to love Trip Advisor, but oh how the mighty has fallen.  When I’m trying to find things to do in any given town, sadly I am insistently shown tours and guides, rather than location information.  Tripadvisor is merely a platform for trying to get me to book a tour through them rather than a guide to help me find what I actually wanna see in a particular place.    Their “Things to do” section has become woefully disappointing. On my recent trip to Portugal, Tripadvisor did not really advise me at all. I ended up looking at where the tours took me what they included to figure out exactly where I wanted to go, and then used my Maps program to find out where they were with no help from Tripadvisor. 
Andy The Traveler | i want the old TA BACK!!! | Looking on planning a trip have used this site many times they’re always very good so I’m writing a little review. The past has been pretty good now. We’ll see what happens this next time.,, | Trip Advisor is my favorite way to plan our adventures—in town or away.  

The information is non-biased and accurately describes the various options for dining, lodging and entertainment | I want to especially think the front desk team, Nikhil and Jee for making our stay comfortable and inviting! Nikhil and Jee corrected an issue that we had with our room. This is what makes customer service a satisfying experience. This property used to be a Marriott. Now that it is a Hilton property I’m continually satisfied. | Matteo is a wonderful historian and a great Guide. I recommend using Matteo and
Crown tours to make your stay fun 
and interesting. | Good tour with the right balance of quality and quantity. Could have spent more time at El Escorial but covered most highlights given the time constraints. Valley of the Fallen was a nice side trip that we would not have done on our own. Christiana our guide was excellent. Gave a good balanced commentary about topics that may have political sensitivity. Worth the time and money if you have seen the highlights in Madrid. | Utterly amazed to discover this treasure of artifacts, tables, stools and benches, straight from the wood artisans themselves.  Incredible prices including shipping to the states. I now have 4 beautiful souvenirs from Bali that I will cherish for years. | If you like to cook and learn new cuisines, you’ll love this class.  I’m a chef and enjoyed the experience. It’s a small class (max. 8) and you get a full experience (prepping & cooking) with a market tour of the ingredients you will use during class.  Instructor is friendly, engaging and gives step-by-step guidance in the preparation and cooking of several courses.  You also get a recipe book in print and electronically at the end of class; AND a video of your experience.  Great memory to have.   Transportation: Our driver Dewa was also very nice.  I mentioned something I wanted to find and he took me to a place I could get it. | Trip Advisor is helpful in providing us the best vendors and experiences in our travels based on experience and reviews of others.  TA Takes the unknown out of the selection process.  Thank you. | This was a really chic hotel right in the middle of everything. Young professionals everywhere and excellent accommodations and service. | Not to be missed! It was absolutely wonderful! | This is a great app - other than for whatever reason the people who design the app think it’s a great idea to not let people filter reviews by date (most recent).  I don’t care about reviews that happened two years ago when there are obviously more recent reviews and I’m not interested in reading through 250 reviews to find the most recent.  And by the way, the “last 3 months” doesn’t work.  I tried it and the search result was one review from 11 months ago, even though there was a more recent review.  Please fix this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | This is a great museum for the Merkel, Texas area.  The exhibits include school memorabilia, local police, veterans, and more.  It is well worth the visit!  Just off I-20.  Willie the docent is knowledgeable and friendly with museum visitors. | Just had such an incredible experience skydiving with Skydive Kauai! Dave, the owner, Ben and Taylor, the professional tandem divers, and the pilot were all amazing and so helpful and friendly!! This was in my bucket list and I am so glad I chose to do it in Kauai! The views were spectacular!!! | Delicious food.  Winston was my waiter and he was very helpful with my dinner selection.  Cesar salad was actually a meal as it had grilled chicken in it.  The lasagne was my main entree and I could only eat half!  Would highly recommend this restaurant and Winston! | As a well traveled person, and having once had the function of displaying countries visited on the site, it’s disappointing to see its no longer available. Odd that TA cant incorporate more of Google or at least parts of the world, to allow feedback and reviews.  Over half the towns in Africa I’ve been to, aren’t “allowed” on TA. 
Time to do the full switch to google it appears | The food was not fresh or hot, and they just covered the chicken and brisket with BBQ sauce. The cheddar grits were good. The collard greens were not cooked long enough with no seasoning. | @RACHEDTOHME  #rachedtohme | Combined with a very educational windmill tour, this was a fantastic time for a great price.  Bonus … there was wine. | We had a very nice breakfast at St Regis.  Always delicious food and the service makes the brunch all the better.  Our server was Fahmy and he was very attentive and made sure we had an amazing breakfast.  Definitely recommend | Great coffee, milkshakes and fruit juices. Smoothies to die for! The staff (Antonio, Dominga, Ismael, Olga, Yenny and Neveida) are ALL super attentive to every whim and need! Even brought my 13 year old behind the bar to mix his own special fruit drink! | Sam was a great guide today! She knows all the hot spots to find shark teeth and fossils. Shes very knowledgeable and can tell you what everything is that you find. 

Would highly recommend taking this day tour! | Am amazing, wonderful, relaxing, staff friendly and accommodating that go above and beyond your expectations kind OD resort. Super clean and plenty to drink and eat all day. Food was particularly very good abcs still prepared every. Definitely will be back! | Using Trip Advisor is a great way to ease your mind when traveling. It is user friendly and offers a plethora of options such as food, activities, lodging, etc. when you are traveling. Trip advisor also makes it easy to write reviews and post pictures. Great app to have for any  expert traveller and your beginner traveller. | Leider versuchen wir unser Geld zurück zu erhalten . Da die Leistung nicht erbracht wurde. 
Nun sieht es so aus das wir geblockt werden und auch unsere Bewertung wurde gelöscht . Das ist alles andere als seriös. 
Wir sind wirklich enttäuscht, denn das war ein Geburtstagsgeschenk . | We had Andres as our waiter and he was excellent and served us a wonderful meal at the grill.  
The meal was  very tasty and the flavors were authentic very unique | Waste of time to leave legit reviews. TA likes to remove reviews or reject them. You cannot leave an honest to goodness bad review anymore it seems. No matter how bad a place may seem. | The Parc Bistro on 5th Ave. has a magical feel when you enter and glance down a long neighborhood bar bustling with people and great food. Farò the owner has been in the restaurant business for 30 years I know of. He is warm, friendly and serves wonderful French food. The best dishes and has an extensive wine list. The monthly wine dinners with a winery rep there to discuss their wines are a sellout! Live music weekly and reasonable prices. | Rahul server was excellent…. Very attentive and polite !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great view of burj Khalifa fountains …….,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, great service …. Food very tasty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super nice hostes gave us the best service here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Big selections on the menu food and drinks . Music is amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Friendly environment all over . Feels like home for sure | The app is completely broken, even after updating the app, logging out, logging back in… can’t see any pictures, can’t change my profile picture or see it, can’t share or view itineraries… completely useless now. | Amazing !!!! The Sicilian pie !!!! You won’t be disappointed !! | We stopped at Verona after a yacht trip. Marlon was very attentive and gave excellent recommendations. Everyone was satisfied with their meals. I would recommend. | Never have seen such tight slots.
Our host complained we were not playing much, so we said, your slots are to tight 

Lost a lot of money and made zero

Will visit other Caesars and other states, but not sure I’m gonna be back to Vegas anytime soon | Found the Baixamar seafood restaurant from a recommendation of our hotel desk clerk. The meal was by far the best we experienced on our entire vacation. If you like fresh seafood definitely get the seafood platter for two. Well worth the $ and flavors. | I stay here twice and both times was amazing the guy at the front desk I think his name is siyani but he was the best I’ll stay there a 3 time just off how siyani made me feel | Galo was above and beyond,, dinner was delicious but the service was even better 

We have been coming since 2012 and it’s our favorite spot and experience 

Must try you won’t be sorry ask for Galo | No matter what country I am in any excursion I booked with trip I know it’s a guarantee good time. | I use it to navigate places while on vacation and write reviews as I go. | I always use trip advisor anytime I go somewhere new | The outdoor seating area is by far the best outdoor atmosphere in the Upstate! The indoor area is quirky and unique too and the food is always delicious, the service is consistently great and the menu is more interesting and diverse than most places within hundreds of miles. Whether you’re going for happy hour and appetizers or an amazing lunch or dinner, I can assure you that you won’t be disappointed! | This is one of the best trail rides I have been on. Zip Lining in morning and trail riding in afternoon.  Great day and place. Everyone is pleasant. | Wintered at the Resort 2024, wonderful experience.  Met very friendly neighbors, lots of activities and monthly special dinners and desserts prepared by volunteer residents. The office ladies, Nancy, Brenda and Michelle, were all very welcoming and helpful. Marissa was my contact for any maintenance or housekeeping needs.  Wonderful young lady, very knowledgeable, could answer any question I had.  Very helpful. 
I rented a “Park model”, lot 93, which is absolutely beautiful! 
Completely stocked with everything you will need, just bring your clothes and your toothbrush! Very impressive. | My family and I loved țhis place. The staff was superb and the food was very affordable . Their ceviche was so delicious. | Thre female refuse to serve my daughter and I — we sat down outside - without checking in with hottest 

I am in a sling and sat down at an empty table outside while my daughter park the car

Happy travels :)","5.9.1",0,"USD",true,573012553,"Roadtrippers","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/roadtrippers/id573012553?uo=4","https://roadtrippers.com",4.64837,"I have no clue what this site offers | I paid for the package that allows me to plan 3 trips with 20 stops each. When I was planning my trip,  I put in more then 20 stops, because I was trying to see what all my options were in terms of activities, restaurants, and hotels. I meant to remove some of the stops, but before I could, without warning, the app locked my trip and is demanding more money for me to unlock it. I spent a lot of time planning my trip.  I booked my hotels, now I can’t go back and see what I did unless I pay more money! That’s so mean. I now have to plan everything out again, because I refuse to pay a ransom for my trip. I was having so much fun before this happened and I was going to recommend this app to everyone, but this experience took the wind out my sails. If I were you, I’d try and find another company, because I feel this company is a bit deceptive and unethical to lockdown my hard work without warning or a grace period….at least on my first trip so I could figure out how they’re system worked. Such a shame. | Trick you into membership and offer nothing unless it is premium.  You have to scroll in super close to see any attraction and can not see large overview of the area on the map.  Makes it impossible to discover something new.  Total waste of my money for a basic membership. | I’ve had trips planned and had access. Even if an email was sent, I should always have access to my previous trips while paying to use the app.  Prices increased , and trips are now limited as well as stops. I no longer can access my past trips that I’ve paid for and created. Currently, prices keep increasing you now you have to purchase plans. I will no longer use this app. You should have access to your past planned trip! Greed!! I no longer recommend based on continuous price increases for the same access that I use to have. | This app auto renewed at $36 but all the features that were once available have been removed. Even though I paid $36, it  requires  an up charge to actually create a road trip.  Google maps is much better and free.  I’ve been a subscriber for several years and every year the app has less and less features and costs more.  I’d never recommend it. It is worthless.  I can’t even access my previous trips.  What  is the point of charging me a subscription?  I feel completely ripped off. | Really hard to use and lots of spam. Even after unsubscribing | I love Roadtrippers. I use it to plan and route all my road trips. It’s so easy to add n take away waypoints to plan accordingly. It shows highlights and shows off the beaten path places within your distance you tell it. Shows mileage, hours, and even estimated gas cost which is pretty close. | Took us to places that were so fun and all the choices it gave!! Love this app | Little to no Help available. App navigation is a nightmare! | What a huge disappointment!  We have recommended this app to many friends and used it for numerous trips since 2021.  We ultimately subscribed in 2022 at $29 per year for the unlimited stops and completed one cross country road trip in excess of 10K miles.  The features to find interesting stops were what sold us on renewing again in 2023.  We completed another major Northeast road trip last summer and when we were notified the price was increasing to $35.99 a year we felt it was still worth it for the memories we were creating.  Now when I went in to share a previous trip with a friend I find that all my past road-trips are locked and to view them I have to pay more money.  The new tiers reduce the number of stops per trip to barely what was allowed with the previous free version (20 stops vs 15 stops).  They say they notified people of the change, but I cannot find an email alerting to the drastic reduction in capabilities for a significantly higher membership subscription.  The FAQ page states no refunds are available so I guess I am stuck for another year with a useless subscription (I have fixed my automatic renewal).  I do feel the company was not straightforward with warning existing customers with the severity of impact that was coming (losing access to all previous trips, reduction of waypoints per trip, etc).  This was really masked when they gave you the same capabilities for the remaining subscription period. Very poor customer service and loyalty to existing paying customers! They way to fix this is to restore access to previous trip that were purchased under previous plans and give an additional transition period for previous paying customers.  When we discussed our journeys with friends and mutual road-trip enthusiasts, we always provided raving reviews about this app.  Instead of having an ambassador for their company, they have now created someone who will trumpet their deceptive business practices! | Please help me cancel my subscription. I am not using this. It did not work the way I thought it would. | Love this app - the camera quality is amazing. Use this everyday | This app was great in 2018, I did the week trial a couple weeks ago and within an hour I quickly realized that the app was much different and far less helpful than it once was. Ultimately used google for everything I needed.  Now being a few days beyond the week trial period I’ve thrown money away because they’d rather have a bad review than issue a refund from a polite email. Too bad. | I am having so much trouble figuring this app out! | I used to absolutely love this app, used it on a few trips from CA to TX. But like all good things, now they want to charge you an arm and a leg to use it and there is no monthly option! I’m not paying $80/year for a 7 day trip. Might be worth it for anyone taking 4+ trips a year but why in the world can’t it offer a monthly option? Won’t even let me look at my old trips now without paying and no free options at all any more. 👎🏼 | I’ve used this app for over a year and i was pretty satisfied with it To be honest.
Then when i got requested to renew my plan (which i was about to) i noticed that not only the prices went significantly up but also the features included shrunk and i would need to get the most expensive plan in order to get back access to my older trips.
This is disappointing and made me not renew my plan yet.
Pretty bad move guys! | Not only did this app give us bad information during our cross-country move, they will renew your subscription without any warning whatsoever. Basically, they think their customers are suckers and treat you as such. It wasn’t worth the price I paid a year ago when I actually tried to use it, and it certainly isn’t worth the price to have them sneak the charge through without giving you the opportunity to opt out. If your business model is to rely on people to forget about their renewals rather than to provide a product or service that people WANT to continue paying for, then your business is a failure. | I expected Roadtrippers to be a source of information about places we plan to visit on an upcoming roadtrip but instead of being an interactive guide I can only set a trip place A to Place B and a map is shown between those two places. We are planning more of a wander to get from A to B looking for interesting spots to visit on the way, restaurants, local interest, but this doesn’t seem to be what Roadtrippers is about. Glad I only paid the introductory price. | Fine | The app is amazing ive been using it for 3 years now, recently the pricing structure changed since i only do 1 roadtrip yearly it didnt make sense for me to pay for the premium tier, so now i have a trip already planned that i spent 10s of hours putting together which i cannot view anymore unless i upgrade to premium.

I understand when services beed to go up but this is not the way to it. I did reach out to customer support to atleast be able to view my trip that i already created so i can copy it down or something which they refused, 

unbelievable! | I had used this app before and signed up for the trial to test it out again. Meh. Frustrated that the expensive annual subscription went through a week later with no courtesy reminder or anything. I know this is how they get your money, but it’s really soured me on the app. I’d be much more happy to give them my money if it was a monthly subscription so there was a lower buy-in for short trips. | I absolutely LOVE this app (and the desktop website). I could go on and on.l about it. I’ve used it to plan out three mega road trips for me and my boys and without RoadTrippers, my drive would have been boring and predictable.

If I had just used Google maps I would’ve stopped at a theme park, a zoo, maybe an overlook. Instead we found an insane and unknown rock formation, the actual grave of Dr. Pepper, a tiny military museum in a tiny town, a parrot sanctuary and a trail of cherry blossoms in peak bloom.

I love that you can collaborate with others that aren’t premium members. I love adding stops along my trips and having the driving/mileage info for each stop. I love seeing reviews and photos within the app so I don’t have to go googling. I love it all.

I got my mom onto the app and now she has used it twice as well to plan a regular road trip and an RV road trip. Apparently, the app shows where RV hookups are and is a dream for traveling with an RV.

Never going anywhere without checking this app first!! | Don't try to use this while you're driving you'll get a wreck | The features of the service were nice and very helpful for planning a trip, the real problem is the ridiculous subscription plans. When they first switched to a subscription based model it wasn’t great but it is a helpful app and supporting the developers is total fine, so we were fine with it. Recently they’ve updated the plans again without notice, and has locked us out of almost all of our trips that we had already planned (with no way of accessing them other than to buy a new subscription model). Finally just switched to google maps because it’s free and can save our trips without fear of no being able to access them. | You have to pay and you can only pay annually. | Stop the spam!!!! | Stopped along my route at a wayside rest area.  Without touching the phone, it then rerouted us back 14 miles onto a route that was about 100 miles longer.  Sorry I ever subscribed | Seems fairly straightforward and intuitive. Still early but I like it. | I’ve had this app on my iPhone (fairly new iPhone) for about an hour and it’s already crashed a dozen times. Every time I try to put in a destination it locks up. Add RV info it locks, try to open up to see what the annual fee is and it locks up. Every time I have to completely close it down and start over. I tried reloading the app and it does the same thing. I’m going to play with it a little more but if this is how it works I certainly won’t be buying the upgrade or recommend it to anyone
Update: after removing the app and reinstalling it, it’s just as bad as before. | Luckily I caught it before our trip, but this app completely messed up our trip from California to Vancouver. In fact, don't bother with this app if you're going to Canada at all. I spent, not hours, but days meticulously planning a 3 week roadtrip. Only to realize that this app's routes become incomprehensible north of Seattle. | Really enjoying the app so far. But noticed that there’s no option to select French cuisine for travel. Also, for hotel stays, would be great if we can search by hotel brands. | Unable to choose from different routes. Like the ability to find hotels and campsites. | I entered my trip destination and get a blue line indicating the route but it covers over the interstate designation. Major interstate highways are marked and coveted over but no other roads or highways are indicated. When the route has a change from interstate to state, county, other, roads theres no designation as to what road it is. I tried zooming but that was no help. Since I'm not provided a navigational list this app is really of no help to properly get me safely to my destination. So tell me whats the big deal with this app? | You make it impossible to stop renewal you only want to keep my money. The only way I can find to stop the renewal is to cancel what I have paid for. Not good | gotta get a subscription for more than one place on the route bruh | Turn by turn directions are inconsistent and  not enough lead time to make turns.   Does not appear to be Apple phone compatible | I find it difficult to use! | This was acceptable at $30/mth for access to 3 different apps, but when you only camp 6 times a year for it to double its cost for the same functionality, then tier off the value of the app with functions that brought you to the app in the first place is just price gouging. | This is a really good app. Definitely recommend it. Mostly an easy way to put a trip together, plan stops, construct a map. I would give it 5 stars except for a few very frustrating things that drag this app down. And could easily be fixed. I do understand that maybe it’s user error, but … When you are on a trip, you open the trip and it goes to your current location in Map View. However, when you open the List View for that trip, why doesn’t it go to your current location instead of starting from day one and you have to scroll all the way down until you find what you’re looking for. The way dates are managed is a complete nightmare. Changing the dates of an entire trip is such a hassle. And you cannot plan a trip without dates as once you add your first date, the app puts every single waypoint on a separate date!! Who thought that was a good idea?! You can add things that are not on the map already, but you can only add an address, you cannot label the address as to what it is. There are a lot of things that are not included on the map that I would like to add to my trips. And label with a name. This app is not a standalone app. You need other sources to complete the picture. Especially because there is a blue line indicating your route that completely covers up the highway numbers. Highway numbers are essential to trip planning. Also, can you update the gas pricing? It’s no where near accurate. And organize the trips into past and upcoming/future? | G Maps and this nav system come up with  same routes which is not conducive for RVs.  The previous togo rv nav system was way better | Not easy to start navigation - ridiculously hard to do. | Interesting app. Paid the $60 fee and used it for a single road trip. Was pretty useful at setting up driving routes and ranges, similar to the old AAA TripTik. Found some good restaurants and museums along the way. 

But it has mediocre UI/UX. It dumps a bunch of OTHER people’s road adventures into the place where you store yours. Whenever you open it, you have to go digging for the trip(s) you’re working on because Roadtrippers figures you more likely want to see what others have done in an area you aren’t even visiting and that’s more important than your own trip! 

Think about asking a friend to hand you your hammer and instead they hand you random other tools in your box until eventually your hammer shows up. And they repeat that over and over. Wouldn’t be relying on that friend for help, even worse if I were paying them. And that’s how I feel about the experience of Roadtrippers- $60 a year to have it throwing up random adventures from other people when I bought it to focus on my own trip(s) is absurd. I can find plenty of these types of stories in more detail on YouRube or other websites- I’m paying for this subscription for a “professional” tool that focuses on MY road trips. Far too much noise and clunky navigation. 

The reason it went from a 3-star experience to a 1-star rating: apparently it’s rigged to make it impossible or near impossible to turn off the subscription. You follow a link from the app to log into their website, go to “manage subscription” or “turn off auto renewal,” and it takes you to yet again ANOTHER website for a company called “Stripe.” And does “Stripe” let you manage your subscription or turn off auto renewal? NOPE. Stripe wants you to put in your email and they claim they will “send a link” so you can log in. And the link is good for 30 minutes. BUT- the link never arrives. Tried it twice. So, Roadpass/tripper and Stripe have apparently designed a rat trap where they can claim to let you turn off auto renewal, but there is no way to do so. 

Come the end of my subscription and if they try charging again, it’ll be an instant chargeback with my bank. These sorts of schemes need to be called out for the fraud they are. And Apple may need to be advised this is going on behind the scenes, even though it’s a useful app, the trickery in preventing cancellation is abhorrent. | I was on auto renew. The price last year was 29.99 for unlimited plans with unlimited stops. It renewed for 35.99. Five more dollars, OK. But for three trips with 20 stops each. All the trios except for one have a lock sign on them, so the app isn’t even registering that I am a paying customer. There was no notice or email that the plan was changing. And of course no refunds. Will NOT be renewing | Used this app for the first time and it DID NOT take us to our Destination. Don’t trust it now and won’t use it again. Good thing my Trailer is on the small side or I would have had issues. | Killer app just learn how to used this app and it is worth every penny | This is annoying. I have logged out and logged back into my account but cannot see the trip I created on my desktop computer through the phone app. The phone app is not recognizing my user name or email and will not allow me to update it. Spent $60 on the annual membership for the premium package. | roadtrippers and campendium are supposed to be merged, but there is no campendium info here. | Very hard to understand what you actually have access to. Tried to sign up for all 4 apps but found out I only got Roadtrippers not Togo and Campendium like I wanted
Dallas Willard | Seems like developers might have forgotten about this project? I put in a 1,200 mile road trip and it couldn’t find a single gas station, a single hotel, almost anything really. It found 3 major historic land marks that almost everyone in the world has heard of… so whats the point of this app then? And you want people to pay for something as well? It’s scary to see junk like this being advertised. Seriously, I feel like i’m living in the movie idiocracy sometimes. | Wow, I couldn’t even figure out how to use this app before I ran out of free tries and they wanted me to pay for the upgrade. Why do they assume you want to plan a trip starting from your house? I wanted to find out what things there were to do once I leave Austin on my way to Marfa in a couple of months. It kept putting my current location there and wouldn’t let me search between two points any other way. That’s how I lost all my free whatever they called them.

I found that most hotel stays are now “non-refundable” and I wasn’t offered the insurance option.  I think my booking.com days are coming to an end.  I also found my reservation was cheaper on another app after I had already booked the trip.  Some of my prior stays were terrible and the app doesn’t make up for any unpleasant stays.  A review is the best they can do to help which only helps the next person if at all. | The process was easy and did not take all that much time | App is very easy and simple to use. Very user friendly and all information for hotels very detailed and well organized. Hands down an awesome app a must to have on all smart phones and tablet devices. Booking.com rocks! No worries, free your mind... | Booking.com make it so easy and stress free booking a hotel room and offering all of the services in one place with great prices. I highly recommend Booking.com! Super excited for my upcoming trip to see myGrand babies! | Booking.com it's basically a scam, never ever book using this app... | Nikola was such a gem to deal with, in every way. He gave us clear directions, met us on the street when we arrived and even provided us with umbrellas. He was not only a friendly host, but also provided a beautiful property! The view is unmatched and the studio was large. The balcony had comfy furniture and the shower was large! This was by far the best experience I’ve had with a property from booking.com from my month long trip to Europe. Thank you again, Nikola! God bless to you and your family. | Excellent sea view and location, beach entrance just cross the street, staff is care and polite, the price is reasonable, will stay here next time visiting QUY NHƠN | If you’re looking to put your short-term rentals on Booking.com, please save yourself the headache and do not do it. Booking.com customer service is the worst I’ve ever dealt with. Had guests destroy my home and they did nothing to help after telling me for months the “finance department will reach out to me to resolve this issue” months later and countless calls/messages still have not heard a thing. | It was a wonderful, homey, comfy farmhouse. We enjoyed our experience. | Rien à dire sur votre application, on peut effectuer une réservation en toute sécurité sans moins de 2 minutes. | The app is very easy to book a hotel, highly recommended | Booking.com has never failed me! It always has the best prices and recommendations for all of my vacations! 😁 | Arrived at 4:00AM and was happy to make the 6 minute walk to the great apartment. Host provided video of every step for self check-in and we were delighted it all worked quickly. We were provided with a late checkout as requested, and we certainly needed it to get some extra sleep. The kitchen is amazingly well provisioned with everything you could need to prepare breakfast or even a dinner meal.
The entire place was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable.  We highly recommend that you stay in the cozy place. Great communication with the host. | It helps me find and book the best room or site.  I love the map that shows where all the rooms are located by price.  I also love that I can set in depth parameters for my search.  Last, love the additional discounts they provide, the more you use the AP!! | Hadjer was too kind to me, my suitcase broke and he helped me close it. I also loved the room, very clean and there is no noise! | Fast and easy, and always they have a great deal | read the subject line again. | We had a great time in the apartment.
Host was very helpful to us.
Great location | Quick & Easy!!! | If there was a 0 star rating BDC has rightfully earned it… actually, it would be a negative star rating… no question, & I’m not exaggerating, the worst customer service I’ve experienced on any level! It’s comical | About 18 months ago, I used the app almost daily for two months while traveling in Europe. I found it clean, responsive and very helpful.

Lately, I’ve been doing some traveling around the United States. I don’t know what Booking.com thinks they are doing, but I am seriously considering switching to, another service. I’ve had problems confirming with accommodations over the app. I received an email asking me to evaluate a hotel that I had not yet stayed at leading me to believe that I had booked the wrong night. In response I rebooked for the correct night and after I was finished booking the app informed me that, I had already booked for that night but since the booking was nonrefundable, I was stuck.

They are also not at all transparent about additional fees until you are just about to confirm the reservation. I don’t get it. They know what the fees are. Why can’t they just put them upfront so you can fully evaluate an accommodation?

All in all I am very disappointed in the direction Booking.com has taken over the last 18 months. | One of the easiest user friendly apps! Love it! | The app switch the dates I need and booked for the wrong day, once I realized what happened I canceled immediately. However I was still charged. The “ customer service for this app”  lied and said the tried to contact the property, I know because I contacted the property! They, booking.com charged my card and is trying to keep my money! I have reported them and will continue to as fraud. | Wonderful app and very responsive! | Booking.com is easy to use and has so far been great. | D ce nu pot Descarcă aplicația fără payment request?? Știu ca aplicația e gratuită | Me and my husband needed a room for one night booked this  one and was not disappointed at all staff was amazing answer any question we had bed was amazingly comfy and did  not feel like going out to eat so we ordered pizza that was delivered to the hotel | Easy to navigate the web sight. 
Great discount. | It was easy to book and had the best deals for my trip to Cancun! | I booked a flight for an employee but the employee’s email has changed and when I go to call to update it I can’t get help without the email. So the phone message system sends me to online support which sends me a generic message telling me to call so I call again and get the computer asking for the info I can’t get and I’ve searched and gone in circles for 2 hours. I’ve tried every phone number and every booking registration number available to enter and nothing will work. 
I booked the flight and paid for it and have no problem accessing my email and account but I cannot access the information or get a hold of someone to help and they won’t help on their message system. 
They really don’t want to help you and I will never book through them again. | Terrible customer service it isn’t the easiest to get in touch with them! 
I booked a hotel room and had to cancel it so when I called it took multiple attempts to get in touch with anyone and when I did they stated that they would contact the hotel to cancel and get a refund but I had already contacted the hotel and received an email stating that I was not charged by the hotel so here I am weeks later still trying to get a refund that booking has charged me because they say they need something from the hotel stating I would not be charged which I have already received this agreement!
Second I booked a rental car as well when I arrived at the site they said they did not have a car for me and stated that they called booking. I was never notified of this and then it took me forever to reach someone again because you need a confirmation number which I had and a PIN number which I did not receive. Use a different site or call directly. | When it works, the service is great. In a latest update my account was logged out and the password reset feature doesn’t work. It won’t send an email link and over 10+ emails from Booking they cannot fix this. | Booking.com is The Best travel-planning site. I rely on this app for all my travels, local and abroad, and have never been disappointed. So easy to use and the information is accurate and comprehensive. I especially appreciate being able to filter for my needs/preferences, such as “no prepayment required” and “free cancellation,” and having accessible-organized trip itineraries. Highly recommend Booking.com! | I was so happy to be there. It’s very comfortable rooms and  you feel at home.
Because there is a kitchen and kitchen utensils as necessary. 
you can cook anything you want, everything is there.
I highly recommend this place. 😻😻😻 | Worst site. Was charged in error. 
Was booked at a place that was non existent. 
Place I tried to book used this site incorrectly so they cancelled my booking | My husband booked our flights in February 26  for a trip with friends in April. We got a confirmation email reference number flight information and they charged our card. 
When it came time to check in, the airline said “we can’t find your reservation please call.”
So we called. It was canceled for non payment. Booking didn’t pay them. The airline canceled on February 29th. The airline suggested we call booking. When we called them we were told. “No it’s good. Let me look into this” after a brief hold. “Yes it was canceled on February 29th.” Booking took our money for the flight, Knew they didn’t pay the airline, knew it had been cancelled, but didn’t bother to notify the consumer or refund our money. 
All they were willing to do was say “sorry about that we can rebook you will have to pay the difference or we can just refund you.”
When we said that was unacceptable this was their mess up. “We can file a report someone can get back to you in 12-48 hours.”
When we were scheduled to leave in 72. 
Last minute tickets were $1600 more than what we had originally paid. 
Don’t use this service. | We had a wonderful time. Everything was perfect and Chis was an awesome host! We definitely will stay again. | Our stay in Lisbon could not have been better. Nathalie was so very gracious. She kept in contact with us, recommended sires to visit, places to eat and even made reservations for us. The apartment was very well supplied with everything we needed. It was just like home. Plenty of towels, washer/dryer. The full kitchen was well stocked with utensils, Dishes, spices, etc. the location was perfect for getting inexpensive Ubers or walking to several sites. I can’t express enough how wonderful our stay here was. Thank you Nathalie for making our trip of a lifetime to Lisbon truly special. | The interior pictures are accurate. The rooms are clean and do not smell. Cable tv with Samsung tvs work pretty good and A/C units work great. The customer service and care is pretty great. 
The exterior however poses some serious needed situational awareness due to the fact that it is not the best neighborhood. As i am military i could also say there are suspicions characters walking around. The main door to your room is extremely difficult to close and lock. No microwaves in the room. They currently are requiring a CASH 60$ security deposit which you get back at the end of your stay. Bring your own because their towels are small. | This app is great. I use it every time. It’s very safe and super convenient and easy to navigate. | 👍 | Very cute and cozy place!! | Whenever I need a flight or hotel room in a certain area I always use this platform first. I’m always surprised at how low the prices are. I love using Booking! | Really awesome app that makes booking hotels a breeze. | I had about $80 to use in rewards. I needed to use them today but they expired a few days ago. They didn’t say anything about rewards ever expiring. It’s probably in some disclaimer in barely readable type.

I tried to get a refund from the host of the experience but they told me to contact “GET YOUR GUIDE” for a refund. I contacted them immediately and told them what happened and they didn’t care they all just wanted to keep the $222 I had spent on something I didn’t even get to do. I wouldn’t have drove and hour and 30 min just to say I wanted a refund. I actually wanted to do it but I wasn’t able to. Get your guide and the experience host just wanted to keep the money. They didn’t care at all. I’m extremely disappointed by this since I use get your guide for all my travel. Beware they don’t care about you just want your money. | The app is fine, but you can’t trust what they say they will provide and stand behind that. Case in point, I booked a day trip from Amsterdam to Brussels. Flew from Boston to Amsterdam for 1 week The trip to Brussels was going to be the highlight of my week.
I made these plans months in advance. The evening before the day for trip I got an email stating the trip was cancelled, just stating not enough participants. I feel like, I gave them months of notice they gave me 1/2 day.
Don’t trust them with your money and the promise of a good time, they won’t keep it | I recently had a dreadful experience with the GetYourGuide app that left me utterly frustrated and disappointed. Despite booking a popular large group tour in Rome several weeks in advance, I inadvertently booked the same tour again for the same day the day before the tour was set to begin. Shockingly, the app failed to notify me of this duplicate booking. Upon realizing my mistake, I immediately attempted to cancel one of the bookings, only to find out that I couldn’t because the tour was less than 24 hours away.

Customer service was an absolute nightmare. Despite numerous emails and interactions with different agents, they all robotically regurgitated the same excuse: “rules are rules.” It’s clear their primary concern is protecting their own interests, even at the expense of customer satisfaction. They shamelessly lied to me about the possibility of a refund, claiming the tour provider wouldn’t cooperate, only to be exposed when I reached out to the actual agency and received a prompt and courteous refund directly from them.

It’s evident that GetYourGuide’s customer service is severely lacking, with a dismissive attitude that suggests they believe their dominance in the market exempts them from providing quality assistance. Save yourself the headache and use alternative platforms like Booking, Airbnb, TripAdvisor, Klook, or any other service that actually values its customers. Trust me, it’s not worth the hassle. | This app turned out to be the best part of planning a 3 day sightseeing trip in Berlin. I was tagging on a few adventures after a work trip, and the suggestions of what to do were super helpful, booking was easy, the app worked great - just scanned QR codes for all of our tickets, nice reminders, and the maps for meeting points made it so easy to figure out where we were supposed to go. Other traveler reviews were also really helpful. Top notch, totally recommend to make your trip easy and meaningful. | Very frustrating to be solicited to sign up and be told a promo code would be sent and it isn’t sent by email. Had to download the app just to chat with someone. Not cool. They don’t offer military discount which is bogus. Something that should take 10 min to do took me over an hour. | I would have liked to book entry directly, but since I couldn’t, it worked well to get the entry through GYG. | Genial el plan súper recomendado | Get Your Guide is great! Never been disappointed! | I have used this app to help me with planning activities through my numerous trips around the world and it has been very useful!  I highly recommend! | Buy now pay later option is great. It’s easy to use and find things to do no matter where you go, and canceling is easy. | In the iPhone App, it states that you can get on the Hop-on/Hop-off at any stop using the iPhone App. After making payment, the email
Says that you have to go to their office to print a voucher. So in other words, we have to take a taxi to their office from the cruise ship, then a taxi back to the attraction we have booked separately in order to Hop-on Bus! This completely defeats the purpose of buying Bus tour. When you call them, they make up a million excuses, and won’t let you speak to a supervisor. They also have problem with their app not accepting credit cards, and blame the customer. | This was probably the best tour I have ever had. WIDi was very knowledgeable and nice - he answered all my questions and made the experience unique and tailored to my interests. I particularly enjoyed every bit with him through the village and waterfalls feeling like a local. all the tour was great and l highly recommend it. WIDI thank you so much for your time. | We took a self-guided audio tour of Charlotte, NC because we didn’t really know any history of the city.  The tour was great!  We were able to start when we wanted and go at our own pace, stopping if we needed to - such as stopping to get a couple souvenirs at a cute little shop, that we likely would not have found without this tour!  We look forward to using this type of tour on our future trips! | You are the worst company I ever dealt with you are a bunch of thieves | Our tour to the lower antelope is very exciting. Our tour guide Dylan A. answered questions, instructed us how to take beautiful photos in antelope. Very good tour guide! | Planned a trip for NYC and this app was a great tool to use to book experiences. It made the planning so easy. Very easy to navigate and the check ins were seemless. | Was not what was expecting at all.  Thought this would be a self-guided walking tour, but instead just the info on sight-seeing spots.   Now the info was good if that’s all you are looking for-you will enjoy this app.   But I was expecting a path route to guide me through the various points of interest.

Also, spent at least 2 hours with representative trying to figure out my redemption code.   Being I thought this was a path route experience, I dealt with this- otherwise would have washed my hands of this app after 5min. | Enjoyed the ride and the stories told by our guide Jeffery! | We arrived late and missed a ticket but they gave us a another  ticket | I tried cancelling cause family sickness and they asked for doctor paperwork while I’m in a foreign country , not even visiting hospital . I lost on over 150$ . These guys not considerate at all ! DO NOT DOWNLOAD , better off using another app! | Excelente aplicación. Un día que se me canceló la actividad me hicieron mi reembolso sin problema. Son respondables y confiables. Lo único es que a veces te sale más económico contratar localmente. | We have used Viator and Trip Advisor in the past (both work great) but Get Your Guide has so many tours/activities at a great price and they are so easy to communicate/make adjustments with. Definitely our go-to tour app now. | This was an amazing experience! We learned so much about the culture and importance of the area thank to our amazing guide! He had perfect English so us monolinguals were very grateful for it. Our transportation from Arles was easy and fun. We stopped in a few locations that allowed us to see the bulls, horses and flamingos. I highly recommend this experience. | The customer service center does not have all the information about the booking readily available. The telemarketers do not have access to decision making options and block access to supervisors. Management of the telemarketing center is terrible. 
Be mindful of cancellation policies because you can loose money easily. | A fun and filling activity, the Trastevere walking food tour is a great way to sample  the local food, engage with other tourists, and learn some fun facts regarding the culinary delights of Trastevere. Our guide, Karina, was amazing. She was witty, enthusiastic, and very informative. I highly recommend this tour. | It is very basic. Be on time!! They won’t let you in late!!! | Go away app nobody wants you I just want my tickets | Just downloaded the audio tour and excited to see and listen to the history of Palm Springs. | I would definitely recommend you stay away from this company. We took a day trip up from Paris to enjoy this boat excursion. We arrived to a text message that said they’d cancelled. Buyer beware | Get Your Guide,

   This is my first time using your company and my booking was cancelled. I usually use Viator exclusively. The booking was cancelled due to weather. I have checked the weather there is no inclement weather in the forecast and other companies are still fulfilling their tours. That’s beside the point. Clearly something is wrong or broken at Get Your Guide. My biggest issue is that you quickly processed my payment but when you cancel it can take up to 14 days for a refund. If you need capital as a company just say that. Don’t take my money then cancel for fraudulent reasons and then make the consumer wait for a refund two weeks. Bad business. I will never use Get Your Guide again. | Worst walking tour I’ve ever been on. 12 of us were wandering around the area trying to find our guide. Location is not accurate. Tried calling the number on the site. Did not work. Tried chatting through the app, and they said they were experiencing high volume of calls, and could not respond. When our guide did arrive, it was hard to hear them as we walked around. Did not know the history, nor knowledgeable on the subject matter to answer our questions. Poor experience, bad tour, waste of money. | We went to Hawaii last year and used get your guide for 3 fantastic excursions. Everything was as described and we had no issues whatsoever. Our experience was so good that this trip to Florida we are booking more excursions. I am hoping all goes as well as it did in Hawaii. I’m not sure if you can get better deals by waiting to book when there, but knowing we have everything booked already is worth any extra expense if there even is one. This app takes you to many destinations, it’s easy to use and like I said so far everything was just as expected. We’re not that tech savvy yet still was an easy experience. There are multiple payment options and it says you can cancel up to the day before if your plans change, so why not book and have your vacation plans well in order. | This company is very professional and their tour guide truly enjoys his job and was very helpful and showed us exactly where we needed to go to see the most scenery on the reef in Fort Lauderdale. if you want to do something exciting that you’ve never done before and walk away amazed… then you should do the Seabob excursion through this company. You won’t regret it! | This app is easy to use. I booked excursions to see things we probably would not have seen if we didn’t use the app. I plan on using this app on all my trips. | I never leave reviews on apps but me and along with the other plenty negative reviews, I would strongly agree you DONT use this app. Communication was awful and the itinerary was not correct. The only positive thing I can say is that the customer service was great when I was getting a refund! | It was nice to see how to make French bread and croissants. Stuff was friendly. Unfortunately we didn’t receive bag with goodies to go as it’s said in description. However, we still got one piece of bread per family before we left. It was informative to know a some history of croissants. | Should have recd the tickets a week before instead of the day of | Guide said there is a “message“ ,  nope.  Can’t reach guide. Maps are not accurate.  Refund apparently takes 3-5 business days, but billing is immediate. | I don’t recommend using this method for booking your activities!
I planned a day trip to Key West for the snorkeling trip, our activities were canceled due to mechanical issues with their transportation! 
I was told I would get a full refund I never received it when I contacted the company they offered me $400 back out of a event I paid over $600 for!
I was there on time with my two kids. There was no fault on my end. Why I cannot take my children for the snorkeling event in Key West. It was all on their end so I should get a full refund. Don’t waste your money with this company! | I did no planning until I arrived and was able to find activities at a great price last minute. 

Mucho Graci | This app has been so helpful on all of my trips abroad. I love the ease of booking and having so many options available. There is literally something for everyone! Sometimes the app is more expensive than other avenues of ticket purchasing, but again, the app is just easier to pull up purchases and tickets. However, the meeting points of some tours are difficult to find and unclear. Also, customer service is horrible to deal with. I accidentally double-booked a tour 5 days in advance bc the app wasn’t working properly. It took a half hour to fix and the person I spoke with was not super nice, told me I was wrong, there was a language barrier and I had to repeat the number 4 times. | Update your dirctions to the dock. What is posted there is not realistic RiverRoaf is block there are numerous new structures between the dock and the aquarium | Last year, my husband and I went on our 20th anniversary trip ton Spain, Portugal, Morocco, & Gibraltar. Get Your Guide was a great app to use in planning some of the places we wanted to see. Purchasing tickets for tours or points of interest was easy and the cancellation policy is very good. We had one place we had to cancel because of time constraints and we got a full refund because we cancelled within the time frame they mentioned. I also like the fact that tickets are stored in the app or you can download it to your phone and since we have iPhones, all our tickets were stored in Apple wallet so it was safe and secure and hassle free as we didn’t have to print physical copies. Also the freedom of not having to get in line to buy tickets is another bonus. We visited the Tile museum in Lisbon and the tickets were for the same day and entrance is at anytime so that helped us plan our day and we were able to take our time at all the places we visited. | Paid €180 and never received tickets. Called the “helpline” and received no help. | Great guides and reasonable price. | Double billed on tour for Same Day in Charleston . Could not be on 10:30 and 1:00 PM tour , as it’s the same exact tour . 
I requested a refund of second tour, and Never a Response back . I submitted both GY code numbers , waited 5 days and still Zero response . Asked to be called 2x , Zero response and no credit issued | I successfully paid for and used this service exactly one time. After that, I received an error code when trying my next booking.
I was told for “security” reasons, I was blocked from future bookings but they couldn’t tell me why. Amazing!!

Output are flight prices better than in google flights, although here they can track the prices. Still, travel agents that I know, they also use Skyscanner, these professionals. It’s the best, | Always find good prices | I used to love this app. They must have updated it and the update is terrible. You can no longer search anytime anywhere. When you initially do the search, you have to click into each location and then a specific city to even see a price which is really annoying. Then once you click into a city, the search changes to specific dates that I never picked and nothing pulls up. | Been a follower and patron of Skyscanner for almost 20 years. Never had a complaint. Keep up the excellent work! | I use sckyscanner religiously for travel. Best prices around and consistent platform. | App is worthless constantly crashes | Used to be a great app, now it’s useless garbage. Absolutely no reason the “anytime” option should disappear once you select a country, if I wanted to find the date it was cheapest, I’d use google, at least google shows prices and availability before selecting exact dates. If anyone wants to ruin an app they made, take notes here from these bozo’s!💕 | Hace varios días compré un boleto de avión con destino hacia Orlando saliendo desde Charlotte, a última hora el vuelo fue cancelado y en ningún momento me fue informado ni por mensaje de texto ni email que el vuelo no saldría esa noche. Ya cuando se acercaba la hora del despegue fui a preguntar y la respuesta fue cancelado y que regresara al siguiente día cuando ya había pagado hotel y alquilado un carro al cual solo estaba esperando mi llegada  a Orlando para disfrutara de los servicios que ya había pagado y llamó a las aerolínea y ninguna persona a respondido | I’m very disappointed to see that not all airlines are listed airline for destinations, and routes. For example a recent US itinerary that I put in, only offered one airline. I know that at least two other airlines offer routes for what I put in because I checked them directly with those airlines. It’s not much help if you don’t list all options available. | For some reason they took off some airplanes from the search. For example the United is out from many search that I now they have flights, so I need to use United APP to check the prices. | This is my all time favorite flight finder app. I rely on it and I swear by it.  I’ve been using this app for a very long time, maybe 8 years or more.  It is easy to use, to create alerts and save trips. You can get as many or as little updates as you want.  People are always amazed when I tell them what I paid to fly. I also love the option of fly anywhere so I can just pick a place to go based on the price. | I'm sorry but The text is too small for my eyes. I coud not find a setting to increase the font not dies the app utilize the accesibilty setting for font size in the operating system.  In this case, an iphone. As a result I have to pass on using Sky Scanner. | Prices 👍🏻 | I find the app most accurate airfare comparison and it shows most of available airlines options | Flight, hotel, car. Dare you to compare with google travel ! | I have tried them all and have settled on Skyscanner as my app of choice. I ALWAYS find the best prices and the best routes . | App redirects to shoddy airfare sellers instead of actual airlines.  This is disappointing as the Star Alliance website uses Skyscanner’s interface for actual airline prices in the alliance.  Best to book via airlines directly and check via other means than using this app. | Setting price alerts is one of the main features on this app but when I set a price alert in the mobile app they do not appear in the “my trips” section to be able to go back and view them. Defeats the whole point of the app as it was one of the main reasons I used it. Still works for the most part to find cheapest flights but no good for monitoring the price fluctuations.

Update: There is no option for “help support” in the app. There is a “support” button and within that a “find help” button that takes me to a webpage where I can search the apps website for answers to FAQs | One stop shopping for travel needs! Great price alerts for more savings! | I can’t see the calendar dates with cost of  fare one way. 
Please help | I love this app. It’s my goto whenever looking for flights. I always find the best rates on here. I’m always recommending it to my friends and family. I book all my moms travel on here. I like that it redirects you to the airlines website. | By mistake, I put wrong email, and I don't have any record for the reservation. | I would like this app to give me the option to filter-out flights on certain airplanes. I do not have confidence in Boeing, so it is important to me to be able to easily filter-out Boeing flights. | Love Skyscanner. But filtering out planes is crucial nowadays. Will change to 5 stars once aircraft model filters are implemented. Reason: I truly do NOT want to fly in 737 MAX planes, and I can’t easily filter them out. | Super app to see all travel options and prices! | Why can't I book tickets on this software? Showing my identity doesn't buy it. Only students can buy it. Why is it so difficult that this software is only sold to students? | All of the marketing emails come to me in Pounds Sterling. I can’t fix it in the app. I’ve tried. Hence, my confidence in this app is low. | Extremely efficient app. | Hate the recent update that removed domestic US flights. Skyscanner was my used travel app and this almost completely ruins the point for me. It was already lacking in filters and the latest update  just made it even worse and ruined the user experience for me | I like it when it shows the price of each day of the months | only reason i used the app | You used to be able to click the explore everywhere tab & it would show you the cheapest flights from your nearest airport. Now it just shows you countries, 0 flights in America. The entire reason I used this app is now gone | Automatic 1 star and deletion of the app | Great deals on airfare directly to the airlines | Why the mention price has been Chang after submitting | Skyscanner is the best app for my travels. They seem to give you honest prices instead of inflated numbers to get extra money from you. I highly recommend. | Not the first time | Links to fraudulent Indian websites | Easy way to compare prices | I don’t fly basic economy. I wish the app has an option to filter out basic economy fares. I have to leave the app to find the regular economy fare on the airline site. The app should let me remove basic economy fares from the results. | Love this app! | Helped me find flights in a crunch when other sites could not deliver | It would be a better app if the prices WERE ACTUALLY the real prices. Most of the time they give a low price but once you click on it, it doesn’t exist. For example: I saw a roundtrip for $81 from New York to Colombia I click it and the price doesn’t exist. It’s so annoying | من آفضل المواقع للحجوزات الطيران و الفنادق و ذلك عن تجربة | ونتما لكم المزيد من التقدم والازدهار | It would be even better if I could save certain settings for the initial search. Specifically, there are certain airlines that I refuse to fly. Of course, whenever I see a great deal, it is usually for one of those airlines (cough, spirit, cough). Any chance there could be an update to the app that would allow for that? A way to save favorite airlines? That way I don’t get my hopes up when I see a super cheap flight that will just add on the fees AND give terrible service. | Awesome | I have used Skyscanner when I start planning for a trip. Every time I have found Skyscanner very efficient, easy to use, and the price indicator extremely helpful. I will never undertake a trip without using Skyscanner.
Wilson | I went through the entire process of booking a great priced flight only to have it REJECTED!  Wouldn’t take my three digit CVV code!  Scammers. I’ll never use or recommend your sight again. | Waste of time, price change just before pay. 
Not just a coincidence with this kind of searchers.

Hosts have the power to set ridiculous rules and choose exploitative policies that hurt guests most. Very difficult to plan group trips when hosts set arbitrary rules about visitors. Additionally, the refund/cancellation policy is nearly hidden until after you book and then you’re stuck in a bad deal. If Airbnb is supposed to be the better alternative to hotels, they need to at least put guests first. | Your support team has been little help and now me and my family don’t have a place to stay this weekend. We are doing some remodeling this weekend and will not have access to our utilities. We decided to go with Airbnb because I have a dog and not many hotels are pet friendly. They won’t let me book a place because of a “safety risk” that we might be having a party due to short notice. Why would I book last minute to book a party. I just want a place got my family while out home gets fixed. ZERO customer support, once I contacted them to try and resolve it the support lady simply read off a script that said summarizes to “to bad so sad” and “we sent it to the right team” . Might as well have AI answer their customer service | The hosting side of the app is terrible. Way too many issues. Booking as a guest is fine though never had any issues on that part | I have been a host for several years.  Generally good experience and the guests have been almost all wonderful.  However I did have one damage claim and got no cooperation or payment from AirBnB.  Very frustrating run around and very contrary to the assurances they give.  So just know you are on your own - they take the fees but do not support. | Trash app!! Don’t even let me book lol. | I love booking with Airbnb, it’s easy and has less fees than other sites! | First time using the Airbnb app.  We reserved an apartment located downtown San Antonio. Had great reviews, pictures looked good and a 4.9 on cleanliness. We arrive to our Airbnb and noticed the floor would creek pretty bad. There was dust everywhere. We found hair also in some places. The sofa was covered in stains & crumbs. There was a towel in the washer (only had a washer) the dishwasher was very dirty also the keurig, the bed sheets seem dirty too. It obviously looked like the place has not been cleaned in a while. We didn’t even stay for an hour there. I let the host know, also taking some pictures for evidence. I didn’t get every single thing because I thought the ones I did take were enough for anyone to tell this place was not cleaned. The host ends up telling it was cleaned that day and to send the pictures. He then told me I had to speak with Airbnb customer services because I asked for a refund. They end up telling me I can not get a refund because it was “minor cleanliness” and only cared if I had a picture of the towel in the washer but not the sofa that had stains all over.  I couldn’t even get a partial refund. Airbnb only cares about the host and will side with them even if they are in the wrong. THEY DELETED BAD REVIEWS ON THEIR APP. | They cared and fixed the issue that we had. | It used to be a good way to book reasonably priced accommodation these days you can book a hotel room for less😂 | Airbnb let Stuart Morley steal $2500 from my 80 year old crippled mom. Don't use this app they're thieves! | The problem with AirBnb can be summed up by saying it could potentially ruin a vacation or save a vacation with many factor built in between. Firstly it’s layered as to who to blame.  First there are AirBnb policies and then there are hosts.  A hotel for example may clearly state the rules and allow rearranging travel because they have many rooms available.  Airbnb just has the one place you booked with a host who has options to rearrange, change, or refund.  Also those hosts aren’t necessarily great when it comes to customer service.  For example if you get sick and need to move a reservation around hotels and airlines are understanding.  Airbnb host might just take your money and run with no recourse other than a bad review.  Which AirBnb favors the host because you cannot sort by good or bad reviews.  It gives the average rating and then you have to sort through to find the bad reviews.  While I have experiences reasonable host who are accommodating.  I have also experienced a host who just took my money for no services rendered. This is the reason why I cease to use AirBnb ever again. | Love this app. If anything happens they take care of you! | This app is amazing I love looking at houses hotels and it is so relaxing to look at  when you are bored | Some of these hosts have the most insane cancellation policies found nowhere on earth - 50% refund if cancelled at any point in time, 100% upfront. Not only that, but you can’t even review the host after interacting with them. I will never use Airbnb again - see ya | Airbnb is the worst they will lock your account for no reason and the customer service doesn’t do anything to help time for them to revamp their company | Watched all the homeowners in my town use this to make more money by letting people stay in homes while the locals moved into hotels and cars. Kinda messed up and total waste of resources. God help us. | Hidden fees not shown until checkout. Other companies like booking.com and vrbo show the actual “price total” upfront on the map view. After cleaning fees, airbnb fees, and taxes, some listing totals double in price (which is insane anyways), so that should all be more visible when viewing map view. | The blocked me from booking at all because a comment I said celebrating me in my spouse alone for peace for his birthday they said it could lead to party’s so I’m not allowed to book any houses so I most definitely deleted this account you guys makes us leave comments then take the account away from your ai that can’t read correctly | Love the interface design. The best design in the industry. Just waiting for them to verify listing to weed out fake listings. It’s not that hard. They have the technology for it. I just don’t know why they don’t do it.

I also don’t like the fact that I cannot see what I made last year. 

I would like for them to show me what dates people like to view the most on my calendar. | This app is a mess. Try to search for a location then click on one…. Who knows where you end up. Date selection is a disaster. Even if you want a destination it always defaults back to “map view”. | Party house . I don’t know who’s renting this out to kids? Over 100
Kids at party in a family neighborhood. Cops
Called,Guns found. 100 kids running from cops at 1:30-2:00 Am .
Helicopter overhead .This in not acceptable in a family neighborhood. This needs to STOP! Please close this bnb | Trust me | You pay with real money, but when you cancel, they give you credits that you can’t even withdraw. It’s really disappointing how the costumer service can’t even solve an issue with the host. | After getting scammed by a host, airbnb sided with the scammer, threatened to cancel  account, and kept my money which is basically stealing. I spent an entire year complaining ti customer service, and they kept promising to fix the problem only to ghost me over and over again. | The app is over 200 MB | Todos los lugares que voy la uso | Price filter in app is nonfunctional. Ridiculous bug for an app like this. | We had one of the worst experiences using AirBnB with an absolutely terrible host and AirBnB was a joke to work with. They do not protect their customers over the hosts which allows the hosts to get away with dirty properties, false listings, etc. and there is nothing you can do about it. We won’t be booking with them again. | I am a superhost of a monthly rental. Unless someone selects monthly rental my house doesn’t pop up at all. There’s a yearly event near my house that lasts 3 weeks. Housing was low and going for very high rates, but unfortunately for me my house is sitting empty because Airbnb won’t show my house unless somebody specifically request a monthly rental or input dates that exceed a month why not homes that are available in the area that are not meeting the criteria so that someone can still click on your house and see why they don’t meet the criteria whether it’s unavailable dates or maybe they would change and add an additional weekend so that they can get housing in an area where housing is extremely limited now there are a bunch of people that need housing that never found my listing and I know I’m not the only one because I’m in real estate and I’ve had people calling me in the area that are having the same problem with Airbnb not showing their listing unless it’s over a monthly rental. Because of this, I’ve listed the house on the local MLS because now it’s sitting empty. Lost revenue for hosts, Airbnb, and also people that need housing won’t find it because it doesn’t show up. | I had a burglary in Walnut, CA while staying with Airbnb. The evidence and police report proved it’s previous tenant broke in with passcode (the Airbnb host never changes password). We have lost our bags and even a car. Although car has been recovered, it has a stolen record on carfax. Airbnb and host started ghosting us since then. Disgusting they couldn’t do anything and let users bear all the losses. | I have been a user of the platform for years. Never encountered a problem (probably my own good luck).  When an issue finally arose, I was met with silence, and then what I can only describe as an automated, generic massage from what seems like a robot. Shame on you the company for allowing customer service to get this way.  Taking my business elsewhere.. | Title: Great Concept, Disappointing Execution

I genuinely love the concept of Airbnb and the unique travel experiences it aims to offer. It's a fantastic idea that has the potential to transform how we experience new places. However, I am deeply disappointed with how the platform operates, particularly when it comes to customer service and its arbitrary process for handling disputes and bans.

During my last experience, I encountered serious issues that highlight these flaws. The customer service for guests was not only abysmal but also completely opaque, leaving me frustrated and without clear answers or support. Even more distressing was the arbitrary nature of how bans are issued. I had an ex who misused the platform to stalk me by pretending to be a neighbor and even escalated to calling the police on me, leading to my undeserved ban from the platform. This situation was handled poorly, with little to no investigation or consideration of context, which was incredibly disheartening.

Adding to the disappointment is Airbnb's lack of a loyalty program, which feels like a missed opportunity to reward frequent travelers. When faced with the choice between an often too-early 10 or 11 AM checkout at an Airbnb and the flexible 4 PM checkout that Marriott offers for Titanium members, the choice becomes increasingly clear. The lack of such benefits, which are standard among hotel loyalty programs, makes Airbnb less attractive in comparison.

While I remain a fan of what Airbnb aspires to be, these significant shortcomings make it difficult to trust and rely on their service. It’s regrettable because I truly appreciate the innovative approach to travel Airbnb promotes, but without improvements in transparency, fairness, and guest benefits, it’s hard to see myself using this service in the future. | I love Airbnb as a traveler and as a super host! The honest reviews and photos assure me especially when I travel alone that I know what to expect. Especially when it comes to other super host properties and the host themselves I know I’m getting the inside of local eats and things to do! | I’ve always used AIRBNB when I travel until recently. I stayed at an Airbnb in downtown LA during a trip. Knowing it was going to be shady finding parking plus the fact that I had rented a Porsche and wanted it garage, I immediately checked the “has parking” option as that was the most important thing to me. 

3 hours before I checked in, the “host” told me that I no longer had parking (I could no longer cancel at this point) he told me I would need to park a block away in an unsupervised lot and pay extra. He told me. Obviously this wasn’t okay, but I tend to let things go with the flow instead of cause a problem so I gave it a chance. Downtown LA is so unsafe and not only did this host lie to me and say it was in West Hollywood, it was a few blocks from skid row full of homeless people. The next day I found that someone had scratched my rented Porsche and was charged for the damage. After taking to I kid you not 10 different employees each asking me to explain my situation when they could have easily keep past conversations in file was sloppy. I spent a lot of money with Airbnb and all of it was a lie. I have no doubt the actual renter of the condo stored his own car in the spot he advertises for and hours before someone checks in, he cancels your spot.
I felt very unsafe walking a block to my Airbnb alone at 1am after meeting with friends when I expected to have a safe garage space. 

AIRBNB sided with their renter and I will never rent you airbnb again. Honestly hotels are now… better at least I know what I’m getting, VRBO is great as well. | This app is incredible but I am no longer getting notifications since the last few updates- which impacts me as a host! I have tried to fix it from the app, from my iPhone setting, uninstall, reinstall- nothing is working. It’s a huge flaw that impacts my experience! | One of my favorite apps ever. I appreciate how many features the host experience has yet still feels lightweight and straightforward. | This app is great if everything goes as planned. But if your place is dirty, with trash in the pool. You only get one day of pool heating even tho you paid for two. They don't help with anything. Our power even went out for an entire day with no explanation. Airbnb have no help. Told me to request my own money back from the host? That's just weird? They also just ended the conversation when I asked to talk to someone higher up and just kept telling me to figure it out on my own. | DO NOT book with Airbnb. If you are trying to save money by staying at an Airbnb instead of a hotel, STAY AT A HOTEL!! It is reliable, safe, and filled with real customer service people.

I have had plenty of good experiences with the platform until recently. After having to leave a booking due to unsafe property conditions, Airbnb did not provide a refund from the host. 

We requested reimbursement for our alternative housing and communicated with Airbnb customer service for 3 weeks straight. We sent them video and photo evidence via email multiple times and they continued to deny that they recieved anything. Every time we sent a message there was a different representative and it was entirely written by AI, with grammatical issues and repeated phrases expressing how ""sorry"" they were in many different ways. They would also call me at odd hours of the day/night. Lastly, they denied that we reported the concern in time and kept on requesting information that we had already provided. | Airbnb isn’t even worth using anymore due to the insane hidden fees. The cleaning fee basically doubles the price of the stay and there’s no way to see it while searching. | airbnb should understand that their platform became successful because host were using their platform. Travelers would go with the cheapest and most convenience place listed my property on Airbnb after one month customer service is horrible. They’re not trained and all they care about is closing the ticket. | Well, I have been with Airbnb for almost 10 years. But last year I stayed with a woman in Norway who was racist and nasty to my friends and I. She left me a ridiculous review and I tried to explain to Airbnb that I had 24 amazing reviews. And on February 5th, they deleted her comment finally. When I logged onto my account months later, I realized that the comment was miraculously back. I called and asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told no. And even though I asked over and over again why the comment was put back, they just said nothing. So I am done. I have heard from friends about Airbnb leaving them in unsafe circumstances and I should have quit at that point. This is just scary to me and Airbnb needs to change their way of doing business. But someone will need them and that will continue. | I had to cancel a reservation because there’s no elevator and it wasn’t specified on the listing. Airbnb refuses to give me my money back. Blatant violation of the American Disability Act. Nobody cares at customer support. Filing a dispute with my credit card company | Annoying and don’t upgrade. Garbage map loading and if it ever loads. | Booked an AirBnB today and it said reserved, 3 minutes later it said my booking was cancelled and that I have to wait 5-7 days for my refund. Stole my money and now I am unable to pay for a place to stay until I get my refund. | I had a host harass and constantly contact me about nonsense and Airbnb didn’t do anything to help or assist me, insisting I just leave the Airbnb and pay for my own accommodation elsewhere. Not enough checks and balances there | Just google “can’t trust Airbnb reviews” and you’ll see what I mean.

My one and only bad review on this app over years of using it was removed. I had a horrible host and I left a polite but bad review but it was taken down within hours. Once I googled what was going in, it seems like there’s way too many having the same issue. Reviews for locations within the Airbnb app are taylored to help the host. One cannot post a bad review which is why you almost never see negative reviews if any. Do not trust this app, just go get yourself a hotel and save yourself the headache and the host ruining your vacation. Not all host are bad but because of how AirBnb handles reviews, it’s impossible to know if the one you’re getting is a good or bad host. | They charged me for two separate stays at the same exact time and said that they were “accepted” reservations though I never booked either myself. What made the situation weirder was that they were in the same complex for the same exact dates making it look like it was a scheme. I have been trying to get a refund for TWO months to no avail. They have terrible customer service and terrible policies that do not help the consumer. I will never be using this app again and can’t wait until something better comes along. | Imagine if hotel wouldn’t let you rent because you was arrested on the past for non violent crimes. Well Airbnb is now doing that. I get protecting people but they took this too far with me and are gonna lose a lot of business!! I feel like they are discriminating against me because I’ve rented from here and all of a sudden they shut my account down due to non violent crimes when I was younger. I’m 50 years old now and married and can’t rent no longer using this foolish app. | The App is user friendly except I feel there is so much information that at times I do t recall where certain information is stored … such as if you want to Edit cost per night… it’s not easy to find. Other than than that quirk, it so easy. Especially the pay-outs and tax time information. | Airbnb always comes out on the side of their hosts, the people from him they make the most money, against those who are renters. They have kept thousands of dollars of my money for their illegitimate and corrupt “policies.”.

Dont buy anything from underprice if u wanna save u money | I always depend on Kayak. For bookings in the US and overseas I go no other. | Super fácil encontrar un vuelo con conexiones. | I haven’t traveled in years and I find Kayak confusing and not very user friendly for first timers. I couldn’t find explanations or instructions on what’s expected of me to actually book a flight. | Gracias x este servicio de avisar | Please add filters for aircraft manufacturer and model. That will make me start using this app again. Ideally let me save the filter as part of my preferences. | Everything good | I have used Kayake for many years now and find it to be the best app for finding the best deals for traveling. | Use Kayak all the time. Today airport codes are not loading and locations aren’t being recognized | Hey!! I love to travel with Kayak, but I’ve been having problems daily with Kayak that I want to be fixed so I can be able to travel much better with Kayak.

Problem 1.
Sometimes when I search up an airport, I’ve been seeing that the airport that I am searching up for, wouldn’t show up.I’ve been seeing this a lot so please, if you can Kayak, please improve that you can fix this problem I’ve been having daily with.

Problem 2.
Sometimes when I search up a flight, it takes forever to load and even when I go to sleep, it is still loading and will never ever stop.Please Kayak if you can improve that you can fix this problem please do so I can have Kayak much better daily.

Please fix these 2 big problems I’ve been having daily with Kayak.

Thanks!!!!! | Great | Doesn’t even show you the cheapest or best flight options. 
I looked on Vueling for a destination with some specific dates: Direct flight R/T 178€
Kayak’s result for +-3 days around same dates as Vueling’s: 190€ one-stop flight..on Vueling.

🛑App deleted!🛑 | Kayak is not disclosing full price you pay- they didn’t disclose resort fee. I would not have booked it if they had disclosed it. Uninstalling app. Would not recommend | I love you | Very good deals. Thanks. | I love kayak! | Kayak used to be really nice, but now they have opened to scammers like Ovago and Gurufare. | Really good at finding cheap flights | The best option and many deals | The search function has been updated in such a way that it automatically brings you to the “Explore” tab and only shows roundtrips (even if you input One-Way in your search) to a specific airport (i.e. only shows flights to/from MIA even if you enter “Miami Metropolitan Area” in your search, thereby precluding FLL and PBI from the results). These changes have rendered the app useless for the purposes I use it - to compare one way flights from general metropolitan areas (i.e. NYC to South Florida). | Booked a hotel through the app.  It was the worst travel experience ever!  Showed up with our whole family to find out the hotel was over booked and they cancelled our room!  No warning or anything. Had to repack our car and drive another hour to the next available hotel. It was not in a great area and a sketchy place all together.  Even though we never stayed in the room and had all these issue we can’t get a refund!!  Terrible experience. | I’m trying to cancel a hotel reservation. No number, no link to cancel, no cancel button. 
Same thing happened when I tried to cancel a car years ago. Intentional. I’m deleting the app as soon as I get this hotel canceled. | Great UI/UK easy to navigate to find great airfares! | Blocked as bot searching for vacay destinations | This site always seems to be where I start to find my flights | Great site. I can always sort to
My preferences and feel like I get a great rate. | Please add filters to remove boeing airplanes from flights. | I love this way of buying my flights, it is very helpful to find a cheap flight along with my budget. Thankyou so much. | Very good app for flight ticket booking, I had very good experience with the application | Kayak sent an alert of $616  EWR to CDG R/T but when I click, I get everything BUT NOT the ability to book! | Super convenient, affordable, and easy to plan trips around your budget. | I’ve used this app many, many times to get great deals on flights. The explore feature is rad. Very flexible app that if you dig into can really get you a good deal. No joke. | Do not use Kayak. They automate travel sites that also includes scams and upcharges. Use Travelocity. They qualify their partners from my experience. Was charged over $1,000 in travel insurance that was hidden: had to cancel my cc. | How do you have eDream here???? | Me encanta | Confianza y son unicos | Kayak used to be an excellent aggregator if information and direct connection to companies (hotels, airlines). Now they often simply direct you to third party sketchy companies. Not good at all. | Does not allow me to book a rental car through the app. | This app is full of legal scams so do not even trust its partner sights. Book directly with the airline | Great information & excellent cost savings 👍 | Sick and tired of Kayak ads. The more i see them, the more i want to delete the app from my phone. | I love how consistently accurate this app is! | Fantastic price. Always recommend friends and families. Always have better deals | When I want to know the arrival and departures of any flight I used Kayak. It’s always up to date with flight information | I’m noticing a glitch I’ve seen for recent years now in that my nearest airport is drastically higher priced than the other airport nearby PSC. I cross reference with Alaska Airlines website our only rural airline and I discover it hundreds of dollars cheaper sometimes. Please correct! | PLEASE 🙏 THANK YOU 🙏 | 10/10 definitely recommend !! | This is amazing because I can’t find these low prices on the actual website for the airline ✈️😃 | What a great site. Gives the whole picture and has many filters allowing to get only and exactly what you’re looking for!!! Been saving $100’s and still only flying my fave airlines!!!

I’m doing this on a iPhone. | I love this app! I only discovered it recently because it was rated as great for car play, but it has quickly become essential for me to plan my routes based on the elevation chart. Living near the Rocky Mountains, elevation is often a key factor in route planning. | All works well just wish the map didn’t lag when searching and creating waypoints | There needs to be a way to change the numbers of points entered so that you can put them in order or can add a point that you see is needed later into the middle of the line somewhere and get it in the right order. Also when you are using, the route developed, it would be more desirable if the turns were referenced by road numbers rather than by street names because most of these people using inRoute are using it for commercial purposes and we use road numbers rather than street names. Desperately need the road number as the points description. The local street name does not help a person who is not from that area. The road number is the descriptor that we need. When the points have been positioned where they need to be, I do wish that the line and route would follow the pointsexactly by their number order and not try to route along the shortest route as the crow flies. We put in a specific order for a reason. Permits require exact, turning points and roots of travel. | I have multiple businesses and I use this routing app for multiple purposes I use it for routing out routes for showings, routing out routes to drive on trips. It just really comes in handy it’s worth every penny and it’s very very user-friendly. | I’ve tried at least half a dozen apps and this is the best for our travel. I can adjust the way points according to my mileage and easily find the best route. It’s not the most user friendly app but they are constantly improving | I’ve tried most of them and this is the best gps for me. I make multiple stops a day at regular addresses. This platform provides an excellent solution to gps guidance. It Integrates, imports , and optimizes routes in a not too complex way. I am very thankful for this app. | Can’t see all the road numbers. Tried everything and still nothing. Not very impressed with the app. | The app has the most flexibility in finding stuff every x miles. It is worth reading the tutorial to get the most out of it. | I find some of the user flow confusing in this app. I’m planning an 18 day trip. Its helped order my way points. It’s confusing why every way point can be a start or end stop as well. That’s un-necessarily complex UX. The segments don’t display time. 

In the list view (which is nice) it shows distance and time since origin - I see no immediate value in this. 

What I want is how long is the drive. While it alternates from stops to layovers, there does seem to be a fair amount of confusing / unnecessary text. For example “next step”
Is redundant as the next line has the step name. This makes the readability easier rather than burying these details. Would love for stops to include URLs to camp sites (I can add them). 

Happy to chat more if the devs are around. | Usability must be improved. There is no posted speed limit displayed, it does not seem to understand traffic problems ahead, you start on your smartphone and then on your RV display it says you have to end navigation and start again, and if you start any other app you have to start from scratch. Not what you’d expect for what you pay. | Not sure if I was maybe looking to have the ap do more than it is set up for, but I found this ap to not be very user friendly. It does not seem to give many options past just the mapped route. I couldn’t figure out how to even get roadside information like RV Parks, rest stops, fuel stations, etc. | Wished it had exit numbers | I can’t figure out how to turn toll roads off. | Purchased pro version of app for RV. I could not enter any specifications. App continues to ask to upgrade to pro version. Paid the monthly and cancelled.
Update:  went through the app restore process previous purchase and upgrade to no avail several times. | I work in the oversize, super load industry. Pretty much everybody I know uses this app because it is the best one for what we do. I have had many conversations with the people at inRoute, and they have made many, if not all of the changes I recommended to improve it. They listen. The one thing that still stands out as an annoyance is when you create a route, and then close the app. When you reopen the app and the route you created, it often tries to reroute you a different way than what you had chosen, or tries to get you to loop around or make u-turns. On some roads you have to figure out how to force the app to go the route that you want. 
Now, inRoute will tell you that you have to change your settings when you create the route because it will use current Apple Maps information and reroute you if it thinks it needs to or if you chose the wrong transportation method. This should not happen, but it does quite frequently. When a route is created, it needs to stay that way, under all circumstances. If there is a new road closure or detour along the route you created then they should simply have a pop-up window that tells you what the issue is instead of rerouting you automatically. The user should have the option to reroute, not Apple Maps or the inRoute app by default. Specifically, in my industry, we follow permitted routes. These routes are already determined by DOT to be safe, open, and available to us. And when I share this route with other users in my industry and they open up the app even when they select the “adjust” setting when trying to open it, the route still changes the route on us. This is a big glitch because I have had coworkers running with other oversize crews get on the wrong road because of the app making changes by itself. Yes, they should know the route or be able to read a permit, but the app should not change the route - no matter what! This is a big issue in the oversize industry. 
So, lastly, let me just say inRoute needs to stop this from happening and allow the user to make the changes if necessary, based on what I suggested above, that perhaps a pop-up window would come up and give the app user the opportunity to change the route, if necessary. The app should not do this automatically. It happens more often than you know. I’ve tried to get inRoute to change this before and they always tell me that when you’re sharing it, the other person needs to have the same settings. Well, my answer to that is when they download the map after I’ve shared it there is a selection that they can say “adjust”, and it will adjust the settings on their app to match the settings that the route was created with. And they still have issues. Other than this, I think it’s a great app. I’ve used it for nearly 3 years and they have made many improvements several of which I have suggested because of the industry I’m in.
It’s still the best app out there for planning a route, especially multi-state routes. | Needs to speed the directions while on a phone call instead of just beep. | The GPS map doesn’t spin around and stays North to South no matter what direction you’re driving and makes directions very difficult. | Rated four star because gps or maps need to be updated and the buttons could be a more user friendly. | Only 4 because of Apple Maps. Would be great if I could highlight railroad tracks and crossings when I ask for them. This app is used by a lot of truck drivers who move oversized loads. More information is better. Thank you. | This is my first time writing a review for an app. I enjoy using it as it helps me plan my trip before I leave. I gave it four stars simply because I couldn't find good sound quality, and the road highlights on the map are quite thick when zoomed out. | Worked great until the update. Now it won’t even open. Have uninstalled, reinstalled, restated phone, and everything else I can think of. Emailed company and no response. Would like to receive the service I pay for. | Need to include exit numbers. Also, a possible way to check bridge height while in hybrid mode. Other than that love using the app. Thank You. | I am a Road Captain for our local chapter here in Central Texas. I use this app all the time creating routes. 
My problem is that I can only use this app on my work phone, which is an iPhone. My personal phone is not. I would love to use this on another platform, and so would so many other users. 
Is there a plan to provide this free or paid service to Android users? | This app helps me see exactly how far I have between stops.. | This app is great for drivers like myself that haul tall wide heavy and long 
Very handy , worth every penny | Necesito que sea como antes que la aplicación me deba la oportunidad de enviar las confirmaciones | This could be the perfect app.  
I use this more then Apple map, Google map and Waze.   

InRoute is still much better then the others mentioned here for a family trip or simple deliveries. I love the weather updates and road closure updates as well as toll information, for all this,  I give 5 stars. 

Features I’d like to see added are speed limit notifications while using the app, satellite street view with split screen for over all route view while entering the desired route, these additions would increase the value of InRoute and the need for other apps to create a route in InRoute wouldn’t be needed.  

4 star for my type of work due to other apps needed to run at the same time for all information mentioned above. | Great does everything I need it to thanks for making it | I’ve tried the application for 2 days and found it is useless app. 
I removed my trail subscription , deactivated the service and uninstalled the app. 
Today I noticed that they charged my account for $4.31 while I’m not using your service at all. 
Be careful, don’t try the app until further update in this review.

Update:
The customer service didn't reply.
I was not able to get my money back.
Stay away and don't be fooled by the reviews that seems NOT to be true. | If you like driving past way points multiple times, flipping countless u turns, and backtracking half the time then this is the app for you. If you’re trying to be efficient in your route pass up on this app. But if you like driving around just to waste time then maybe give it a try. | I use this app everyday creating my daily lawn routes. Has saved me a lot of money and most importantly time. | I love the app but I’d like to see exit numbers and highway numbers when I zoom in on an exit to drop a pin. Zooming in reviews the local names of the roads but not the road number. If you could add these it would be closer to perfect. WE NEED EXIT NUMBERS!!! | Dependable - Accurate - User Friendly - Great planning tool | Trying this on my latest RV trip. Overall it’s OK. Could be a lot easier to customize routes but offset by the ability to save specific routes once customized. 

Major issues: 
1. No speed limit information - which is a major flaw
2. No off line maps.

Minor issues
1. User interface is one of the worst. Hard to find specific actions you want - including just saving routes.
2. Really not good for simply monitoring your driving. Really requires a destination to be useful. | Won’t plan route not good for delivery driver if you need to prioritize deliveries | Great app | The app keeps reversing the order of my stops on my route, no matter how many times I change it and/or save it. I’m planning a roughly circular route going south to west to north to east, the app keeps changing it to WSEN. Also, when I try to zoom in to see the number of a highway, the number stays small even though the highway itself enlarges.

I will not be renewing my subscription for the next month. | Motorcyclist and iphone users dream app. The best of the best. migrated from a dedicated Garmin device to this and brought all my routes over no problem. | This app is well thought out and purposefully built for the traveler. I had searched long and hard for an app that would serve me well on my cross country motorcycle treks …. Recommended it to all my friends. Sponsorship ??? | It is a good well thought out system, but if it were going to get better, it would have the exit number on the interstate highways. | Every update keeps this app getting better and better. It’s my go-to route creation tool for all my motorcycle trips. Highly recommended! | Love the app I am an oversize load escort. Even when raining when other apps stopped working enroute kept working. The only complaint I have is it would be great if you added exit numbers. Because sometimes I have to go to google to find exit numbers to stay on routes that we are permitted to go on by the states.it is the best tool that an escort can have in this business because we are not permitted to leave the route the states have given for any reason. | Great product. Needs mile post on the ramps | I really can’t say enough good things about this app. Sure, there are plenty of apps out there that will route you among multiple waypoints, but this one is different. To say it is designed intentionally is an understatement. The app automatically routes you to the next waypoint after reaching the previous one. The best part is little to know interface is required to keep the app running, which cuts down under distractions and ultimately increases productivity. I have found the app works best on an iPad but it’s great on iPhone as well. For five bucks, I think it’s the best money you can spend if you are in the delivery business or just want to efficiently route multiple steps into your day. What a steal- five stars all day. | I wish it would tell me of a turn while I’m on the phone | Be careful- not all routes are public roads. Pulling a fifth wheel is not easy. | Great app but needs a pause route button for when we stop at a waypoint but don’t want to end the route so it will quite giving verbal directions or tell you to return to route while walking around with my phone in my pocket. Otherwise love it!!! Also it would be nice if it also showed the speed limit for the road you are traveling on like the other navigation apps do. | I cannot figure out how to start a new route!!",4.61059,7840,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/14/9b/5f149b4b-d45f-07d0-33d9-9b8bdfd8bfe8/bb5ec3d5-851a-44cd-9e3c-ed233ba804af_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/06/d9/ec/06d9ecb3-a63b-28f0-f96e-fa0cc5dc76f3/c47fd096-aca3-476c-833f-6ff9acd63d84_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d6/d2/94/d6d294c4-bb44-d9a7-e606-754a94a8e4a8/30d3b8e8-7d57-4d36-8f22-be4f8b0f58a8_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a2/3e/7d/a23e7d2a-23da-bdca-41a1-055c69a60973/a6b2cf54-ec0c-44a4-b0f6-62fd4ae55a4f_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/c6/c2/1e/c6c21e4d-9261-f9f5-f8c7-53bf87bfc75d/3f2cfd8a-52f4-4b20-a9ea-1f64eb7aceef_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5d/c1/f3/5dc1f3f6-bda9-9472-54fd-7bbbaea867e8/1e33be3c-9adb-4ae6-8482-dc923a0a89a6_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5d/15/6c/5d156ce2-1158-6cd6-f445-8af6c5541bb7/1bdbbcfb-9e7d-4d2b-8482-c66b96c51a24_iR_iPhone_5.5_U0022_screenshot7.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b5/7e/82/b57e8290-38f8-bbd7-ecc5-d983a7b8ef59/d05ff24b-73f3-46be-8749-4213826e39be_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d7/71/14/d771148c-51b6-7fcb-200c-3edc80edf146/f329383d-12ba-4eac-b235-606360e613bd_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/55/f8/ba/55f8ba1f-2c95-86c1-c104-e9f0aad46bac/bbaf4e89-a99c-4e6b-b75f-fadd1e40d299_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/75/a7/ea/75a7ea9c-679c-3ed6-c69d-3b61e11563bf/0f15a272-ef5f-47d2-9490-1f628e703f02_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4f/cb/57/4fcb5750-3f68-b803-43a6-ebcbdb979494/45901626-6262-4f73-ac4e-387ce95e9df5_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot5.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a5/08/e4/a508e44c-9616-c411-ba06-010131ebf8d6/4d2f483d-3c17-4543-93c9-7f908e7c9bfe_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3b/13/8b/3b138b19-d1c0-783d-61e7-e6fe9a119bba/6fcc4c93-5a74-4feb-91fc-986c4d33330a_iR_Sc-iPad_12.9__U00282nd_U0029_screenshot7.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone

NOT global at all, and thus currently useless when other similar apps ARE global. | It doesn’t work well, costantly crashes. | No longer way to find cool adventure.  Used to use it all the time. Now will go elsewhere | No matter what region you select, it only returns one result for a paid tour in Japan. No other information, guides, or content present. | This app will help me dream bigger… | Just signed up with culture tour ap.  It has a lot of information and good travel deals. | Half the content or more doesn’t open. 
Yes I’ve tried to reset phone and update app and all other apps are working and wifi is fine | Usually really useful, the app does not seem to work properly. When I go check out the Guides, it just closes down the app | All of my saved trips are gone. 
All of my bookmarks are gone. 
The guides aren’t really there anymore, it’s just paid tours offerings that you can sign up for. 
I will be undownloading and not recommending to friends anymore until the app is better… | From 1 to 4 years ago I used this app frequently to reference the guides when planning trips.  But sometime within the past year the guide function returns zero results for most of the world.  Many countries and cities that previously had many links through the app now have nothing. | I used to love this app and recommended it to everyone. It is so disappointing that I can’t search for anything, nor even access my saved trips. Please bring back the other features. | I used to peruse the app to find articles of places to try and now it doesn’t work at all.  Seems like they are pivoting to selling tours. 🤢 Shame. | I used to love the content on this app but the app doesn’t work anymore. | This app has so much potential…if only it worked. Some of the options to select aren’t being selected when I try to click on them. I also charged the currency to $USD and prices are still showing up in £. I can’t access “My Plans” even though I saved a couple things there. To top it off, the app keeps crashing. Not a really good experience. | Was a decent app a few years ago in terms of articles, insights, and travel recommendations, but now is nothing more than a sales site aimed at selling trips/experiences. Collected a data base of potential customers over the years and then transitions to a sales site. Classic. | Don’t bother downloading the app. 

Not sure what changed in their business model but this app is really just for booking group trips now. I used to use it as a way to find cool local things to do in cities I used to travel to. Great way to plan a trip with blogs about tourist destinations, cafes, restaurants. | Can’t even search for a city. Used this for years and now it’s unusable. | Look I get it that businesses pivot. But you used to be my trusted travel blog that I would come to for every trip for cool recommendations. Now I cannot even find the guides because they’re so hidden behind your big push toward your new shiny object, the tours. 

Some of us veterans aren’t interested in tours. We came to your blog for self guided guides! I really wish that you’d make the guides findable for us in the native apps and web apps. | Sadly this app no longer works. I’m not sure why, but nothing will load. And it is extremely glitchy! | Hard to tell what the purpose of the app really is because it won't load anything, and yes, I'm connected to the internet. | This was once a fantastic app for things to do and see in places around the world.  All of that useful content is gone. Now it is just a booking app for group trips. | I’ve been trying for weeks to get it to work and it does not load. Based on other reviews this is not an isolated issue. | This was one of the best sources of information especially for out of the way locales - the local guides on galleries, fashion, etc was superb. Please bring back the guides and local stories. The app is now glitchy and no longer links well to “things to do” or “food and drink” which made this an invaluable resource. | It’s a frustrating app which is sad because I love the offline articles and content. If I can get the app wouldn’t glitch so much. A simple search won’t upload the content | It crashes every few minutes!!! My saved pages went blank. Do I need to say anymore?  Very sad… | Really sad to see the latest performance. I guess that’s there now Hass to be 3 inches of advertising on every page, however, you could just get the pages to load and I’d It be much happier. As I travel 100#, it’s sad to see this occur. | There used to be a method for searching for many interesting articles on various culture areas. That’s been removed and you only get opportunities to buy travel packages. 

Bummer. Delete. | Love the articles, hate the app itself. I’ve used it for years but no long can stand it. Doesn’t save my favorites, can’t even search easy travel spots that I know there are articles for. I’ve tried deleting the app and downloading a newer version. It’s useless. | I like the content but half the time there’s a white screen or an infinite loading state. | I’m able to register, search (slowly), but nothing shows up. Would love to use but the app needs to kinda work first. | It was a great app until the only thing you can access is now the paid trips that you can buy. I had articles saves for a trip I was planning (37 to be exact), and when I went to access my saved trip the articles no longer were there. Try to search for new articles? They appear on the front page of the app, unless you care to actually read them. When you click on the article nothing pulls up. Useless. | Location services seem to be down. Just downloaded the app, so I have no way to know if that’s an ongoing issue. — There’s also no way to look up a smaller city and populate places in terms of distance. That would be really helpful. — A map option to manually set my location would be a way around both of these issues and doesn’t necessarily need to populate a list on the map. | I booked a trip with culture trip and I am trying to edit the “travel plans“ and I am not able to do anything nor I see instructions on how to. | I miss the feature that showed you popular attractions and restaurants based on your current location | I have used this ap for several years now and my application for the vast information about even the remote corners of the world continues to grow.

Every travel lover needs this ap for their travel planning. | The app has not worked properly for me the last few months. It doesn’t let me search places, won’t display my plans, and it doesn’t save articles to my plans. I have updated it and nothing has changed. | I have imagine such a travel guide app for years. | I love the idea but plans and saved places get lost. My app says I have 6  plans, the webpage says 8, and neither show the 25 places added to my plan, 
Repeat issue | Very useful app for travelers. | A lot of the places have closed or moved since Covid. There doesn’t seem to be many additions since 2020. There is a lack of inclusion of black, Hispanic and lgbtq places. 

I think the app is a great idea and off to a good start but needs some work | There ‘save’ feature is a mess and dies nit work. A waste of time. | This used to be a really cool app where you’d find great articles/suggestions for destinations. Guess it got bought out or something. Seems like it’s more of a booking platform now. Too bad. | Anytime the app actually loads I feel very lucky. Usually I open it and am just made angry as it loads for eternity. Seem every couple of week the app become unusable. The content is good which i would think is the hard part. The app is abysmal. Get it together guys. | I loved this app. I even gave it 5 stars. I now am unable to even enter the app. It freezes on start! I deleted it and reinstalled it several times to no avail.

Update: 28 May 2022 - the latest update has fixed the issues from before. Thank you!! | Help | I used to use this app all the time to help with trip planning. Recently it has totally stopped working; I cannot save any posts and cannot even log on the app. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it to see if it would fix the problem but it has not. I can’t access any plans I made previously either. The problem started around the time they took away the section about hotels/hotel booking.

That are very expensive. | My default travel app from now on. Well done | Very unhappy with Trivago.  My reservation was made, my credit card was charged and I needed to make a change.   Can’t reach the third party company m, Algotel, to make the change.  I never received a confirmation email so I am out $160 .  I’ve spent more time trying to communicate but the layers of communication are ridiculous!  Never again! | When I selected which company to use they elevated the price diferente to the one I saw on the beginning. | Before I found Trivago, I was frustrated. Spent hours and hours and came up with no results, and 6 pages of notes. nothing that we liked. There maps were off or difficult to read, the others you couldn’t  even see the Parthenon or where the Spanish steps were in Rome.
Then I tried  Trivago ….best map….easy to set up filters…easy to see rooms, loved the tags of prices on the map…could see where Parthenon is and Trevi fountain… booked a hotel…thank you | Bait and switch scambug app!! Watch out. The final price will double. | Nos brinda todas las herramientas y recursos disponibles para nuestras necesidades | I don’t appreciate any site that forces us to use cookies | Saçma güvenlik soru ve uygulaması .. robot veya insan olduğumu anlaması için ütüyü çevirmediğim yön kalmadı | Excelente información | All of a sudden, after using trivago, my bank account for the first time gets depleted for reservation next October!!!!!!!!! What’s the deal?? | Not very low I see other apps with less costs 
Adds tell me save but where???? | I like this app because you can found more than 3 prices | Gracias | Minimal | Need them to call me | A beautiful,friendly area. | Best prices I’ve seen. They seem to be able to ferret out the lowest price, great site. | excellent site. easy to use and efficient | I keep getting notifications from your company. I want this to 
STOP. Immediately. | While on the road booked a room for the night. When I got to the hotel realized I booked for the wrong day. Now to try to get my money back. I’m getting the runaround. It’s sad that your site pops up a calendar. That is for a week or two in advance versus the day that you’re trying to book a room for. | Trivago is the best place to find less expensive lodging . I have used it many times and will recommend it to all my friends. 5 STARS | The first place I start and 9 times out of 10 I finish here | Over priced and they are never that low as described:( | We went to LA and found a nice Hotel for a great price!! Ty trivago | Turn logo has a good side overall but when it comes to the filtering, there should be an option to put just the city that you want and not the surrounding areas.

Example: when searching for a hotel in Manhattan New York, it keeps giving me hotels in New Jersey and I don’t want New Jersey. I just wanna know what’s in Manhattan area of New York

Alice | حجزت عن طريق تطبيق trivago وسحبو مني الفلوس ولم اجد حجزي في الفندق ولا يردون على الشكاوي ولم استرجع مبلغ الحجز | Hotels may not really be pet friendly | Trivago has partnered with scam sites such as Rehlat.

The place. The staff was friendly and efficient 
I would have rated it a five except the buffet food was warm not hot. The rooms were great | $88 a night on Trivago, but when I view deal and go to actual site $310 a night? | Prices are fake on the map. Once you go to payment they add a bunch of junk fees which they hide from your in the beginning. Such a scam | This application makes it easy to locate hotels and see all the low prices. I just love it. | I room was awesome. We stayed room# 111 Icouldn’t ask for a better. | Muchas gracias | Every time I want to make a reservation 
They don’t have anything available | We spent a whole week at Lagomar. It was amazing the staff was wonderful. The food was great just the best place in Fort Lauderdale You should rent one of their wonderful oceanfront suites. | I go to the Michigan for college. | The best application ever | Trivago is a very useful application . | Couldn’t get any help with my support dog.

Then the agent manager said they don’t refund, other another hand, they allow people who is under age of 18 can check in hotel in the United States!  ALSO no one is answering my questions, and they are kick the balls between HOOPER and hotel. ‘Manager’ don’t understand their policy well, not professional at all! We even read the policy to him and he still don’t understand, how could let a person don’t understand how to process the customer’s needs. Cutting from my conversation, so rude and trying to cut my call ! | Hop on the hopper for travel deals AllllllllllllYeahhhhhhhhh | I’ve actually been using this app for years I don’t always purchase flights from the app itself but tracking the prices and getting notified when they change is really handy and I love the calendar that shows you what days are cheaper to fly. | Thank you for making travel a bit easier | This app is great, the discounts are fantastic and I greatly appreciate their service | I love the hopper app! It’s never steered me wrong and it’s so helpful! | Great deals | Все нравиться 🙏 | Find great deals. Love it | Love this app for planning ahead | Cheers | Rewards non stop! | Love this app! | This app is the best option I ever have when looking for a price of flight trips and hotels to stay. And it has a option to notify you when prices drop low on the specified date you pick. | Great to track flights | This is a really good app! | Amazing app always with the best deals and service!!! | LOVE IT!!!! My go to for whenever I have to book a flight or hotel! | By using the Calendar you’re able to book at the lowest price available. | Love this app | Perfect | Monitors prices and let's you know the best time to buy. | Hotels baby for my baby’s | It’s easy & always the least expensive! | I love it | This is one of the best apps I have ever downloaded for discounts on things to do hotels, flights, car rentals, and so much more I couldn’t believe how simple it was and yet so cheap❤️ | This has been a great app for keeping track of rate changes on potential journeys. | Love this app it’s so helpful and has helped me find cheap tickets too! | A convenient and reliable app with great group deals and updates! | I’ve never had any issues with this app. Booking is easy and user friendly and prices are very cheap. | Best and accurate app | Good | Great app | Always offers the best deals | This app ALWAYS gets me the lowest possible price and I love it!!! | This is a good app to save your future choices when you’re looking for one. However, it’s kind of confusing the way they have it set up and how the credits work so if they had more information and gave you a tutorial, that would be great. | I enjoy looking at prices on here as they are always less than anywhere else I can find.  It is easy to use which is a plus. | The Hopper app has been great over the years of me traveling. It’s always a great place to go to to check flights before I consider purchasing my flights. | I book all my travel through hopper. It’s so helpful! | I just booked a flight through hopper. The experience was fine, no better or worse than Google flights but after the booking was complete, it took me to a screen asking for a tip… pretty disgusting ngl.

Oh by the way, Hopper, you can show your appreciation for my review by leaving a tip! All payment apps accepted for your convenience, for a fee of course :) | Reserved a rental car thru hopper when I arrived rental car company wouldn’t let me rent the car under the guise of they didn’t have the rental car I reserved. So I didn’t rent a car from them, had to go to national. I’ve requested a refund from the rental car place and thru hopper and both places are dragging their feet to refund my money on a reservation I never got to use. I will not be using either places ever again. Horrible customer service thru hopper. | Helped me save money on my flight to Orlando. Watching for our next trip. | Great comparing fares and trips | This app is awesome. It saves our family so much money when traveling. I usually check the flights on the airlines website, and they are always 50$ cheaper here on hopper! Keep doing what you are doing, Hopper. | Every time I’ve needed help I’ve been able to chat with an actual, (and informed!) person almost immediately. Not only are they able to assist me, they have even given me a phone number to call to be able to speak to someone instead of chatting if id prefer and if I need even prompter help. That’s a rarity in this world! | I appreciate the hopper app being very user friendly for not only me but my elders who use this to travel during their retirement . I appreciate the notifications and freeze price features.

It just blares a continuous message about how to apply for a refund online. Not helpful, as this isn’t what I needed, and leaves me with a sinking feeling as I prepare for the trip, if that’s the only reason why people call. Can’t wait to see if this thing works… | Go City is a waste of time and money. I do not recommend at all. I purchased a 4-pack for myself and my children for a special trip to New York City. The total cost was $400. We were only able to use 2 of 4 passes due to the horrible procedure to exchange this pass for actual tickets. 

If you want to wait in long lines to redeem your Go City pass for an actual ticket and then wait in another long line to see the attractions, then this app is for you. 

If you want to spend your time vacationing, buy the tickets directly from the vendors. | Be wary of purchasing GoCity passes. Purchasing a GoCity pass does not guarantee you entry into the advertised attractions. GoCity website nor app maintain updated information regarding their advertised attractions and reservation requirements. GoCity website, app and confirmation email advertise many attractions as walk up only. GoCity website and app do not permit you to make reservations for attractions that are advertised as walk up only. While GoCity may not require a reservation for an advertise attraction, the attraction itself may actually require a reservation. Before purchasing a GoCity pass, check each attraction website directly for the most updated information on reservations in order to help ensure entry into an advertised attraction. GoCity will not issue a refund once the pass has been activated nor provide any corrective actions for losses incurred due to their deceptive advertising practices. | Signed up for this pass 2 weeks ago and started using it for today and 4 out of the 6 attractions we travelled to get to were no longer operating. 
Fine arts museum, magician Baneck, linq zip lines and Eiffel Tower were all shut down. Pretty terrible. | This was a nine-hour trip. It didn’t live up to the hype. You your his childhood home and see his ranch. Then there are a few stops along the way. The German town of Fredericksburg was the best part, but we only had 90 minutes to eat, walk the town, and visit a WWII museum. Not enough time when you realize it’s nine hours you’ve committed to this tour. | When you pay $1000 you shouldn’t have to read the EXTRA fine print. The ad states that time begins after scanning the the 1st attraction. Our tickets ended at midnight the next day. We were cut off the next day at midnight. Deceitful practices | We did the 2 day pass.. family of 6.. did Universal on day 1.. you have to reserve the morning of the day you plan to visit.. did it, they scanned my phone, no problems.. second day kids wanted to do knotts.. you have to show your passes at both 11/ 12 and they exchange for paper tickets.. same thing, no issues.. highly recommend! Saved so much money! Just pay attention to which attraction you want and follow their admittance rules and you’ll be fine.. will be purchasing again wherever we go!! | This has been nothing but a headache we purchased discounted tickets through Groupon and it was horrible. You can’t reach anybody on Groupon only through a text it took me an hour back-and-forth to get the right confirmation code and then we made reservations for Statue of Liberty and only a couple reservations went through. It has been nothing but a headache. I suggest go straight through Go City, and I actually talk to a human that will help you guide you all this hassle. Just save a couple dollars is not worth it. | The older version can add attraction to a specific date with Morning, Afternoon and evening option. Now, all selected events are unscheduled and cannot do anything else. Need to fix this! | one day only 2 attractions, almost same price for two regular price, but on your own pace and condition, | They have a “savings guarantee” but it’s only if you book 3x a day which is virtually impossible. I used it for 3 days to get premium offers. One of them cancelled on me due to weather. I did the math and I would have saved money if I would have booked everything individually 2 events a day. | Lousy info and customer service | Information on their website is outdated and the customer service is lousy | Don’t even think about using this service. They are overpricing. I bought the tickets for Rome for 3 activities worth $100 and the total entry fee for the very same tickets if bought individually were less than $50. They claim they give you up to 35% which is a flat out lie. | “If it is too good to be true, it probably is”. At first look you would feel they provide better value for money. However, most attractions will treat you like a freeloader. I took a two say pass for miami. And the pass stated “just show up and show the pass”. But Most of the good attractions mentioned they only allow limited people from gocity pass. That means each day, if you go early, you can get one to one good attraction and by the time you finish it all the other ones are sold out. Their customer service is horrible and do not honor the misleading claims stated in the pass. They offered us a partial refund provided we go to multiple attractions and prove that none of them is accepting go city pass. That makes no sense given our valuable time of lost in the process. That said, it is still worth it if you plan to go to multiple attractions. I got a 50% discount on the pass. So covering 4 attractions from the list of 40+ attractions (some are far away from miami and some are not worth your time) will make up for the cost. So plan to book and pay directly for the main attractions like speedboat and if you did end up taking a pass, use it for the less popular attractions. Always call ahead and try to book it as much as possible. | Don’t buy the pass the day you arrive thinking you can use it. It apparently has to go through security checks which takes about 6 hours so now we are here waiting with nothing to do since this was our plan today. I called and they “flagged our order” to be processed sooner but still will take hours. Absolutely ridiculous!!! They don’t advertise this and I’ve been to many other cities using go passes and never had to wait to receive it! | Made accessing attractions quick and easy | The app is glitchy. On initial load- the app looks like it’s struggling to refresh and it’s stuck on a loop doing so. | Everything tells you to make a reservation right? You can only do it same day. Customer service is non existent, I’ve seen 5 year olds with better manners and customer service skills.
Was told no problem as soon as we get confirmation you didn’t go we will redo the tickets. No call, no email. I called back to be told they can not help me. HORRIBLE DO NOT USE! | When you open the map it opens the wrong address. Made us miss a cruise. | We just got 4 go city passes for 3 things to do and in an hour and a half they now say expired and we haven’t even used them once | Title says it all, planned a vacation around a cruise but they had no indication that it was close for the entire weekend we went. Probably won’t use it again. | I saw the promises this app made and was skeptical; it just sounded too good to be true. This app is 100% worth getting. We were able to save $50 with this (we did the 2 day all inclusive). Absolutely get this app if you can | I and my family used the All Inclusive pass and had a blast in Boston!!! We went through sooooooooo many places and there was no hassle of waiting in line or worry about ticket.
The best thing about this was after the whole trip, I calculated the saving of about $1200.
Yeah, next trip to Hawaii!!!!!!!😆😆 | Lowered the review because it asks to rate all the time | I have had nothing but problems using this app! | Tried to purchase from their website, won’t accept payment.  Called the help line, they said use the ap they apparently no longer accept web payments.   Used the ap, get “unknown failure” message with 2 different credit cards.   Guess my money is not worthy of their product. | Could have bought tickets cheaper on my own! | Can’t sync my passes to my email or app. | This pass is useless in Amsterdam. The pass doesn't book tickets so you have to make reservation online with the sites, but you can't pay for the reservations with the pass. Either you chance it and hope that when you arrive you can get in with your pass, or you pay separately and the pass is worthless. DO NOT go without reservations because you will not get in. The sites cost less than the pass in total. And the ferry to the castle was closed entirely so we got stuck 10 miles from the castle without a way back. The Uber cost $70 round trip. Absolutely a waste of money. | A huge portion of the activities were unavailable in general but you don’t find this out till after you purchase and try to make reservations.   Then overnight 1/4 of the remaining options disappeared.  Our premium activity was cancelled by the vendor 10 minutes prior to our reservation and they won’t reschedule or refund, of course on GoCity it shows up as utilized. | Bought this pass as it said I could choose from the San Diego Zoo or Adventure Park (not both). Fine with me as we were only planning to go to the zoo. Once paid for, neither was an option. What a rip off! | The app is easy to use and pretty simple | This has the option to add activities to an itinerary, but I couldn’t figure out how to view that itinerary after adding activities to it. I eventually figured out that if I add activities to my “favorites” instead, I was able to see a list of favorites.

The favorites button is a white button which is displayed on top of an image of the activity. Unfortunately one of the activities I wanted to add to my favorites had an image that was white too in the area where the favorite button was (white on white) so I had no idea whether I was successfully tapping the favorites button. I eventually figured out that I could tap where I thought the favorites button probably was and then go to my favorites list and check if the activity was listed in my favorites…nope, not there. So I tried again…That time it worked.

So after some trial and error I got this to work acceptably to be able to see a list of the activities I plan to do and tap on them to get directions to them. It would be helpful to have these things improved though. | We had a two day pass. We saved $147 each above what we paid for the pass. We used the app and just presented our passes on my phone and in we went. No problems. Probably got to do and see more because we didn’t worry about needing to spend all day at the aquarium to “get our money’s worth”, for example. | Best bang for your buck when it comes to bundling deals AND saves you money in the end. The Inclusive pass is where it’s at. | These passes are great. Saves time having to order at every individual attraction & money… one set price for all depending on the number of attractions. The difference between all inclusive & explorer is… inclusive pass gives you 35 attractions for a set amount of days while explorer pass allows you to experience the number of attractions over several days/weeks. I chose explorer. 😍 | Es mejor comprar por separado tus sitios de interés, no es más económico comprarlo con esta aplicación. Compre 10 atracciones y solo pude disfrutar de 6. Luego no hay forma de tener atención al cliente, no hay quien resuelva tus inconvenientes. | Firstly I like the idea of this app. Rather than scrambling through bunch of different websites to get tickets. You just use this app.

Secondly, I was skeptical about it at first. We went to the edge in Hudson yards. I thought I would have to go back to the ticket counter & get tickets. But it went smoothly. As soon as we went in, the staff was happy to see the QR code and let us in without any questions. I have only used it once. I am actually looking forward to reuse this app. | I bought go-city passes for Barcelona, Paris, and Rome.  In Rome, NONE of the places listed as included (except Big Bus) took our tickets.  In Paris, we got the Museum Pass in addition to Big Buss, but nothing else worked.  We never got the chance to try them in Barcelona, but if you are thinking of traveling outside the US, AVOID THIS COMPANY! | Since you buy passes first, then reserve, you cannot get a pass for what you want to do because everything is already booked. | Processed three different orders and each was cancelled, effectively maxing out my card (at least for 1-2 billing cycles) without a deliverable. WTH. | Seems to difficult to figure it out! | Be aware that this pass is not all inclusive as they say. If you see tours from the same company in this pass, even though it says all inclusive they only let you do one of the tours, not multiple. | It’s a bit confusing on how to add the passes. | The effort to connect the pass to the reservations is unnecessarily complicated and not user friendly. It asks for the code for the passes when you follow the links to make the reservation. It doesn’t tell you you will need the code nor does it automatically provide the code. It should be pretty simple to make this on a secure link. | Very convenient | A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE! Trying to sync tickets purchased at Tickets At Work is taking over a hour. I purchased 2 different kinds of tickets and Go City doesn’t recognize all of the tickets. The rep otp was very pleasant and a little hard to understand.

“Purchasing the tickets to Dream World, on Headout was a fantastic decision. The booking process was smooth and straightforward, and I was able to easily select the date and time that suited me and my family best. At Dream World, not only did we breeze through the crowds, but it meant we we sure of getting entry into the theme park, especially with two children - both under the age of 8 years - eager to start exploring the park without any delay or drama! Buying the Dream World Visa gave us access to (almost) all the rides so with the wrist band on us, we went straight through without having the hassle of looking for change/currency at each ride. All in all, it was a stress-free and wonderful experience!”

“Book and pay a ticket and pay in the app with just a few clicks. Tickets do not have to be printed out and can simply be shown digitally in the app. It couldn’t be easier.
Everything went well on site. Versailles was breathtaking!”

“Through a different provider, I had a trip cancelled last minute the day before and was able to book on to this tour late in the evening the day before. Tickets and confirmation of collection point were clear and the tickets are very easily available on the app. We were picked up at the pick up location on time, and our guide met us and explained what the experience would entail and the time scales. I think our guides make was Raphael, he was very knowledgeable and gave us a very detailed explanation of Krakows history as we were driving through Krakow towards Auschwitz. Showing us all the landmark buildings and their history along the way. Very easy to understand and communicated very well, and very passionate about education us all on Polish history. Very happy with this service and would recommend using them to book tours through.”

I booked and paid only to get an email telling me to expect lengthy waits to redeem my ticket voucher with no option to download the tickets themselves. The chat feature is just a bot that only responds to canned simple questions. There’s no customer service number to call. They do not reply to email. Stay far away from this useless “service”. | This app is just a google drive wrapper.  Should just be a web app. | Disastrous tour: rude guide and the attraction was closed. But will HeadOut refund us? Nope. They offered credits for future purchases. Get effed, HeadOut. | Horribly-designed app, confusing experience, doesn’t allow getting the ticket scan code without downloading the app (so you’re forced to download the app no matter what).  Bought tickets online beforehand, and still was forced to stand in the long line at the attraction to get ticket scan codes. 
Will delete this app as soon as we leave the country. | They intentionally mislead you about what tickets you’re buying and then refuse any refunds when you find out they deceived you. They’re a scalper but they make websites that make you believe they’re the official site of the attraction. Only use them if you like wasting money. | Scammers!!! Stole my money!!! Don’t buy tickets with them, they are mimicking NASA website and don’t return money back!!! | Terrible. I purchased a combo ticket for the prado museum and Royal palace on March 2024 after selecting my date and paying for the tickets the web headout send me a tickets for different dates, a month later. I contacted the web trying to get my tickets modified but they didn’t help at all. When I went to the museum and try to use the tickets the agents mentioned they often receive complaints from lots of tourist with the same issue. Headout didn’t change or modify the date or issue a refund. I had to call my credit card company for help since I had to buy new tickets | First they were not able to book the time they showed and only after we paid they came back and we had to change the time of the museum visit. Then the pdf they showed was only visible on their app and could not download so they can keep you in the app.  Lastly, after a few weeks I noticed my phone battery was strangely draining fast. This morning I looked at the % used and Headout was 59% even though I have not used it for weeks.  Clearly app has tracking me the whole time, either nefariously or they just have bad developers. Either way, deleting now and never using this service again. | They made a mistake booking my tickets that apparently are now nonrefundable and refuse to give me a refund. Never booking with them again. | This is a scam - they rip you off. | Open app, try to log in, it sends a link to your email.   Click link, that opens Safari which then opens App store which lets you re-open app, but you haven’t made any progress getting logged in.

Confirmation of ticket purchase arrives in email.  Aggregation of getting logged in repeats (even though only a minute or two has passed), as you try to get official ticket.  Finally reach a webpage (having given up on the app) that has a download link for PDF of ticket.   Hit “download” and the PDF is pulled down but not shown in Files (just in Safari recents).   When you realize that, you can show the ticket-taker, but you might have multiple PDFs to search through for the (in our case) 5 that are needed (look at the last bit of the looong file name to distinguish one from another and its duplicates). | Think twice before buying with them. They offer discounted combo packages but half of my tickets were denied entry and I had to buy new tickets at venue directly and was told there to email the company for the partial refund. The company replied quickly but the verdict was sorry the local company who sells the ticket is very strict with the refund and just denied it.. so I basically paid for the tickets twice…. | We booked tickets to Rome’s Castel Sant Angelo through what looked like an official website which never disclosed it was Headout. Then, we were never provided with the audio guide information we paid for and were treated poorly by the so called “host.”  The presentation of the website as official and the hiding of the fact that it’s a third party service seems sadly a bit common in Rome but that does not make it Ok. I won’t ever use Headout again for any services due to this misleading and ugly experience. On the plus side the visit to Castel Sant Angelo was great but it turns out we never needed anything from Headout to help us enjoy it!! | They are very bad at customer service and dont attend or give you a callback even after requesting a callback. Also the non refund policy is just simply the worst marketing strategy. I lost over 500$ because of a mistake and they dont even consider any unforeseen circumstannce as a valid reason even with genuine cases | beware when using this app, I purchased two orchestra tickets and when I got to the venue I found out they were switched for first mezzanine against my knowledge. They were not the tickets I selected when I was making my purchase and the even though I have two emails confirming I purchased orchestra seats,  they insist I purchased the seats I got with an obstructed view.  needless to say, my night was stressful and aggravating. I will never use them again. | All the tickets are x2 or x3 more expensive, and they don’t refund your money if you want to cancel you reservation. They stoled 72 euros from me and my family | I have been a avid follower and supporter of Headout and many of their outlets for several years. 

Getting the Headout Plus account has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made! 

I have been nomadic traveling the country for the last 2+ years and thanks to Headout I have wandered and explored some destinations I never would do known existed!  

Would recommend to everyone! Friends, family, and even my enemies! 😃 

Keep up the great work and superb recommendations | I need a code number from a purchase to redeem a museum ticket & I had to download a whole app just to get it…. Deleting asap. I do not have the phone storage for this. I do not have the data to waste to download this stupid app in the street. | The available Dubai offers are Good. The payment worked seamlessly and e-tickets worked well.
But the Currency conversion charges that appeared in the Credit card statement was a surprise! The discount savings that I got from the offer was significantly reduced after these charges. While booking, It was not clear what was the base currency of the site. I could have easily paid in USD with the same card and saved on the AED conversion charges. 
The site should should mention their base currency on the payment page, so customers can choose which currency they want to pay. | This app deserves all the praise! It not only helps me plan my trips efficiently but also introduces me to unique experiences I wouldn't have discovered on my own. Highly recommended for all adventurers! | Been using this app for a while now, and it continues to impress me. The detailed insights, stunning visuals, and easy-to-use interface make it the perfect travel companion. | Can't imagine traveling without this app—it's like having a personal tour guide in my pocket. The detailed recommendations and offline maps are lifesavers! | My go-to travel companion now. Packed with info, beautiful visuals, and significantly enhances my travel experience. Two thumbs up! | This app is not in anyway associated to the official ticketing sits of the museums and attractions. It just inserts itself in the search results using deceptive domain names so you will but the tickets through them and pay more. I think this is deceptive and unecessary. Stay away! | Where to begin…

Headout contacted me less than 18 hours before my scheduled tour to notify me it has been canceled. 

They provided no options for rebooking as they canceled to late, and no other options were available! 

I reached out through email, and never got a response. I waited 45 minutes for live chat, and they told me they couldn’t help, and would need me to wait for an e-mail update. I’ve spent 3+ hours of my vacation trying to get this fixed, and I paid over $100 for my tickets.

I work in support, and I can tell you this has been the absolute WORST experience with a customer support team. This is gross negligence, and it has ruined the last day of my trip to rome. 

PLEASE STAY AWAY!! THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY WITHOUT VERIFYING THE TOUR FIRST, THEN WILL CANCEL SO LATE YOU HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS. 

If I could rate this company a negative 5-stars, I would. | Do not use this 3rd party app. I purchased a ticket and it was cheaper at the door. The ticket was to climb the dome and bell tower in Florence only for the rude people at the cathedral to say it’s not good for the dome even though the ticket says both. Customer service dropped me twice and did not resolve my issue. Do your best to book DIRECTLY with the institution. Also, fees ended up costing more than just buying in person. | They sold me tickets that don’t work. When I went to the Statue Of Liberty tour check in and scanned the QR code that was given to me, I was told the tickets were for October 27th which is incorrect. So headout basically sold me old tickets!!! So a warning to those who hate scammers, DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! I wish I could give this app 0 stars but I can’t, but they deserve it. | Dream World with Headout is a fantastic experience. Their Dream World Visa streamlines entry and ride access, making it ideal for families with young children. Highly recommended for a stress-free visit. | I've used Headout for last-minute bookings, and they've always come through, making travel planning a breeze. Their user-friendly app simplifies the ticketing process, and their guides are top-notch. | Bought tickets and we’re not informed anywhere during the process that we needed to download an app in order to access tickets. Was unable to download the app at the station, missed our train, and had to rebuy new tickets. Horrible communication from top to bottom. | Bought tickets to El Prado Museum using the website, I was never able to get the audio guide authorization after downloading the app. I followed the instructions up to the “You will get an email for authorization”, never got it, tried three times and even contacted their support which was helpless. Don’t buy tckts with their audio guides | I used this app to purchase a couple experiences while in Athens.  One set of our tickets showed in a few minutes with no worries.  However, another set of tickets purchased at the same time didn’t show up until very late.  After much waiting around we ended up buying tickets at the gate to keep our schedule.  I’ve been in contact with customer support who have informed us of a no refund policy and now I am screwed out of money.  Please save yourself the trouble that many here have experienced, including myself now, and take your business elsewhere | My apple pay gets declined for no reason. | Tickets to attraction did not include entrance. We had no notice of that and missed our tour. Fifty Euro lit on fire. Do not use this company. | I purchased and received confirmation for tickets to the Louvre. Several weeks later i received a message that said the tickets were not available and the time slots they offered were one week later — after our trip. I won’t trust or do business with them in the future. | It seems like this company wants to bury the bad reviews that span over multiple years by blowing up their reviews with fake 5 star reviews. They all read like a bot wrote them. What a joke. Had wanted to use the app, but never mind. Shady. | Reliable booking apps. Useful, have been using this apps for more than 2 years. | Really straight forward, rewarded for frequent booking. Great! | Easiest platform I can use. Excellent prices I love it | Great app. Love that we can book over the app with better prices. Thank you guys. | One-stop-shop for all your travel experiences, saving you time and effort in planning your itinerary. | Their discounted offers are a lie/scam based on a super inflated price. You basically are better off buying everything separately and schedule it to your convenience, rather than buying a bulk deal that is NOT A DEAL. Cancelation and refunds are not possible.

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!! | This app allows me to do flight, hotel and cab booking from my smartphone where I want and when I want to | It has been a wonderful experience with headout so far. Looking for more wonderful experience | I am trying to get a flight ticket then my friend refer about this app and when try to books I got a amazing experience with this app | Very easy to use and very convenient | Easy and convenient all for hotel booking. | I downloaded this app while visiting Singapore and tried to buy tickets. However after multiple attempts being told that the payment failed I reached out to customer service. They were unable to resolve this issue. Will never use again. | There are plenty of choices and booking was straightforward. | Laughable process, i booked a skydiving ticket and it was cancelled 
I booked it again and the amount got charged and i didnt receive my tickets, then spoke to customer service and they told me they were booked out?

It’s a good app if you enjoy hiking, but their billing system is a scam. | I feel very uneasy with your recent push to make so much of my experience public. The change to the “public profile” nonsense is the first change ever that makes me want to cancel. I DO NOT want to connect with anyone else nor do I want any of my info shared or searchable. It is not totally clear if I’m public or not public so I have to change my name in the app now to be sure I have anonymity. You lure me to create a review after I use the app (please add a cancel button to the “finish” / “resume” pop up btw that thing is weird) which I’m pretty sure posts publicly. You need a single radio button that lets the users stay 100% private. Many people don’t want a social profile for safety reasons, this obvious push feels invasive. And ditto on the number of pop ups. | It coo, i use it when I travel anywhere because obviously I don’t know the area. So it’s the best app for finding like spots to | 🩷 | I have had this app for years and it has just continued to get more advance and overall user friendly. I have always loved this app and it is a must whether you are a beginner or advanced hiker. | It’d be a great app if developers paid attention to stability and customer feedback instead of rolling out fancy features nobody cares for. | Getting full access to hundreds of trails, camp sites, and other activities is what I call a highlight. There’s so much to see and do so get the most out of it and head up that mountain! | All trails + is 110% worth it!! You can track hikes and other trips, download trail maps, and so much more. Highly recommend | iPads are better for planning than are phones.  If this app is so great, then why is there no widescreen iPad version? | EVER | I’m a hiker in the Pacific Northwest. There are a lot of trails this app simply doesn’t cover. They rely on subscribers to submit them. | Stop the pop ups. Sheesh | Easily the best app for finding new and interesting trails to hike. Support team is also on their A-game when there are hiccups. Highly recommend. However, as a standard practice, any app that has a popup demanding to know how I am enjoying the app only gets one star. Popups are evil, especially for people with ADHD like myself. | It may be a transient bug but I had 5 downloaded maps for use when I was out of cell coverage. No cell coverage and in airplane mode and the app would not open any of the stored maps. My confidence in the reliability of AllTrails is scattered. Hopefully they will explain what happened and why they left one long-term customer in a very bad position. | Great | I used the app this morning and discovered a super cool feature. I had unknowingly taken the wrong turn and after about one or 200 yards the AllTrails app ping me and told me I was not on the right trail. That is a fantastic feature. Plus, it helps you find the right way and gives you, important statistics about your activity. | I don’t think this app as a filter for e-bike friendly trails. Bummer | Good guidance but kills my battery in few hours | It’s price appropriate so don’t raise it anymore. Other than that is 5.0 baby. | We are always finding good hikes to do on this app | I just started my free trial. Apparently I can’t filter results based on distance from me unless I turn on location services. There’s no option to manually input the data. So, my search results based on my hometown net trails an hour+ away from me at the top, but not the ones in my town or surrounding towns (at 500 search results, I’m not digging through them manually). Instead I have to do some funky map zooming. I will be deleting my free trial. | This app stokes the fires of adventure. Vacation starts with AllTrails and planning which trails we can fit in. Filtering by difficulty, activity, suitability, and rating make finding a trail so easy. We have been using it for years and love it. Having a live map makes getting lost almost impossible. | The app worked well on my iPhone until it started sporadically stopping recording during activities.  (I have the ""paid"" version of the service.)

I did a good amount of troubleshooting, following the online instructions. I went further and deleted/reinstalled the app, deleted cache, etc.

Finally I reached to support, which was a frustrating experience. It took 4 days to get a response. Even though my ticket was filled out completely, the rep asked for the info again, then gave me android instructions, then gave me iPhone instructions that don't align with the app behavior. Then they stopped trying. 

I need an app that's reliable and has good support. That's not Alltrails, unfortunately. | App is amazing overall.  Lost a star as you can’t just leave the map screen on while doing an activity.  It times out and goes to sleep.  Not great when running or cycling in the woods. | I have used AllTrails for several years in several countries. It’s been several months since I last used it and so was pleased to see many great enhancements. Keep up the good work! I LOVE this app and I tell all my active friends about it. | Just love this app. Like having a friend along on my walks! Feel confident and secure in knowing where to go. | AllTrails is the perfect app for outdoor enthusiasts! It’s my go to any time I’m visiting another city as I’m always looking for great routes. Thank you! | The maps around my area are always way off. The trails are sometimes up to a quarter mile away from where they really are. There are even 2 trails that are not real trails, not even pathways, but are shown on the map, which makes it difficult to plan hikes or runs. Just take a screenshot of the trail system you are going to hike from your areas parks and rec website, and use the map the old school way. You will be much better off. | Awesome App! So many trails I would not have found without it! | I do a lot of hiking and I can honestly say I’ve never found a more accurate app that can get you through a trail. I hiked El Yunque in Puerto Rico and took a trail that was paved then straight jungle and this app never steered me wrong once. If you hike this is a must. 10/10 recommend | I got a smart watch to be able to use apps like this . The mobile app is great , but the fact that I have to bust out my phone mid trail to use this  and can’t use my Apple Watch Ultra ,is absurd. | Fabulous resource All Trails. A great buddy in the woods- even w/o reception, download before going and voila!  

Very helpful app from which I’ve found a lot of great places to hike. Sometimes info is not entirely up to date re dogs on trails(multiple off leash places that All Trails state dogs need to be on leash). But it’s a very very handy resource 90% of the time. Great app | Wish they would have a feature to filter trails based on what they DO NOT allow. Sometimes I just don’t want to deal with or hearing the clicky clack cyclists or some dogs don’t like horses. As of now you have to go to each individual trail or flip back and forth in map view search between filter settings and find the missing pins | There’s no reason you had to downgrade your website to make people download another app.  Quit being greedy. | Many issues:
bounce out to the main screen instead of the search after viewing a trail
Does a bad job including non English trail names
A lot of pop ups
Very low functionality in free version
Just use any other trail search tool and you maps app. | App works ok. They don’t give you access to much without paying. The reviews on some trails have several dozen from the same person from 1 star all the way to 5 stars for the same trail…so you can’t really trust what the rating is. But it does work ok. Definitely needs better support from the developers. | Please stop trying to force me to download the app on your website. Thanks. | Love finding unsung trails!! | Awesome app, only thing I could ask is if you could add a feature to log an activity as a skate for those that do longboard or inline skate. | Love the app & how easy it is to use and ses beautiful trails all across the country! | Horrible and non-responsive. Can no longer get into my account at alltrails.com with old password or reset password. No help. | simply the best app ever | It’s great. Just buy it. Use it. Love it. Don’t get lost. Have fun. Party on. | All this beautiful creation declares Gods Glory in Jesus name. Thank you AllTrails for making the accessibility to enjoy the outdoors and navigate through them. Very easy to use app with an abundance of information! | Excellent hiking app!  I’ve used it all over North America! | Second year as AllTrails + subscriber. Download maps really helps on trails. Found myself looking several times at the download map, where I had no signal. I absolutely recommend this app to anyone who loves the outdoors, and would like to get out and explore. | I recently got this for snowshoeing and oh boy! Let me tell ya! This thing is amazing for hikes, snowshoeing, mountain biking, you name it!
Saving hikes has never been so easy too with a simple push of a button i have a whole list of new hikes I wanna go explore! 10/10 would recommend! | Even when maps are downloaded first. And of course most of my hikes have little or no signal.

Go get Organic Maps for free … it never requires a signal. | All trails rocks!! A great layout with all of the information I could need.

Unfortunately it would never connect and kept giving me the connecting circle of death that didn’t go anywhere. I contacted tech support and am still awaiting a response 4 weeks now and counting. | I packed everything more quickly than usual and I didn’t forget anything. Will keep using it | I travel a few times per year so I am not a huge traveler. But I did not find this app user friendly. Maybe it just didn’t suit my needs but I’m not impressed. | It has lists that auto populate based on the length of your stay, weather, etc but I really want to just attach my own things in addition, reservations, activities, restaurants. Maybe I just don’t understand this app. And it has nothing to explain it | Not $3, but $3 a month. Super annoying setup where you can just start making a list, you have to put in dates, destinations, and type of trip. I’m looking for a packing list app that lets me input my own lists. Keep it simple. | I’ve been using this app for many years and I’ve been very happy. I only use it once or twice a year and it was free before. I don’t mind paying to keep the app but now it’s wanting me to pay $20 a year. I would be happy to pay $20 just to have the app forever but there’s no way I’m going to pay that every year.I’m very disappointed because I really liked this app | This app told me to bring a scarf to Disneyland this weekend. It’s not going to be cold enough. You need to change your app and only tell people to bring a scarf when it’s below freezing. | Very basic packing list. It is good to include power adapters, health insurance card, but neglects things like an umbrella, hat and jacket and small scissors. Also …for a long trip it suggested 15 shirts …which is ridiculous. I take no more than 5 shirts even if going for months. Clothes can be washed. 
I don’t see any reason to pay for this app. It’s ok I suppose if you don’t already have a packing list of your own. There are many better packing lists for free on websites. | The way the ads appear and they way the interact (close ads overlap, etc), the app is unusable. | Used to be great. Now it’s just ads. How can an app about packing have so many ads? It’s insane. They also deleted all my old packing lists, so I can’t even reference those. Time to find another app. | I downloaded it and immediately opening the app my phone was overloaded with ads inside the app. Absolutely do not like this app at all | I recommend this app to everyone. I particularly hate packing because it’s so stressful, but the customized activity lists make packing a breeze. | Don’t like being forced to watch an ad to use the app | If dobt get premium sibscriptions doesnt seem like you can do much | Update: After using this for a weekend trip, this may not be the app for me. It is extremely frustrating that every time I open the app, it prompts me for an update. However, the App Store does not have an update.

But then all my lists keep getting put out of alphabetical order. This is annoying to find to check out and try to pack. Then items will be added to a person when creating a trip and it is not on the list that I have so where did it come from?

I will be looking for about her app.

———————————————

I am searching for a good packing list. While this one is okay, it is frustrating. I have spent all day trying to load it up with our trips and it is just not user friendly. It is constantly putting my lists out of alphabetical order. So for me to sort it manually within each list and trip is just annoying. I also wish that I could easily remove a person from a trip and changing from multi-trip to single when duplicating a trip. | Updating my review because now there’s offline mode. Great app! | This app makes it so easy to put together a list for packing. As someone who struggles to stay organized, this app helps so much with providing suggested items per planned activity. SO much better than trying to make sure I think of everything on my own. I undoubtedly will either forget something or overpack planning it on my own. | This app is extremely helpful. It customizes your packing lists for the weather at your destination (and can update this). It also customizes it for your planned activities and duration of stay. It is a great way to make sure that you have what you need and don’t forget anything. it is by far the best list of this sort that I have encountered. The only small improvement I might suggest is for long trips on which you will be washing every few days, it would be helpful if you could specify the number of days between each washing so that the app knew what to recommend for packing. Nevertheless, it does a great job. | I’ve never used another tool, but this one has everything I need — pre-built lists, weather forecast and the ability to customize. Love it! | I have used Packr on iPhone and iPad for years. I did not realize there was a Mac app until recently so I downloaded it.

I have tried different packing list apps and packing list methods over the years including a spreadsheet, Notes, a Word document, and other packing list apps. I even tried Macsparky's Reminders packing list idea. I always come back to Packr. Why have I tried other apps if I like Packr? Because I like to try new apps! But I will not stray again. Packr just works for me. I ike that I can make different lists for different needs for different trips and reuse them over and over. 

Thank you for a great app! | I created my trip, selected the categories and when I submitted to continue, it gave me the option to either pay $3/mo or $20/yr for premium or watch an ad. I opted for the ad, because I hadn’t gotten far enough into the app to know if I like it. The full screen, 10-second ad counted down but then it was done, the ad wouldn’t close! The little “x” was there in the top right corner but it didn’t work. I closed and relaunched the app twice, re-created the trip (because it wasn’t saved), and the same thing happened. I could have written out my entire packing list on paper in the time I wasted trying to make this app work. So disappointed. | This app is great, and it just keeps getting better. It works wonderful for multi city vacations or just quick getaways. One of my favorite features is saving customizable list. This allows me to have specialists for each of my trip needs, from camping in the mountains to water sports at the lake. Plus I can add my personalized photo to the top of the trip. | Used to be able to create a new default list with icons to choose.  Not saving new lists or adding an icon.  I thought you could add more than one trip photo. Can't find information on a huge venue tourist site in a city. | I like the concept of Packr but one major flaw. I want it to automatically sync between my iPad and my iPhone. All my other apps automatically sync (icloud) but it appears this has to be manually synced every time you make a change. Very inefficient. | I wanted to try out the app to see how it worked. No matter what activity I chose it pushed the buy-pro. I deleted the app. If you can’t give it a test run to see how you like it, I’ll try another app | My devices have separate apps and don’t load the same trips. It would be nice if they would sync and have the same trips. Is there a profile? Not even seeing a way to log in. | Been a premium user for a while. Really wanted to love it because I travel for work a ton and need customized packing lists. This app has so many bugs and I am tired of items not showing up in lists I create, or reverting back to old lists after being updated. The idea is great but the execution is just not there. | Use basically every trip | Very basic app for the price | After creating your trip, you’re met with a full screen advertisement that can’t be closed even after the allotted time. The X button is unresponsive. | I purchased Packr Premium several years ago and absolutely love it. I had a problem when I deleted this app off of my iPad and thought I had lost all my lists, but the developer fixed it within a day. I use this app for all of my trips because I love the weather forecasts which help me know how to pack. I also have saved customized packing list for different activities like backpacking or international travel. I have recommended this app to several travel buddies who were green with envy when they saw all it could do. If you travel, it’s worth every penny. | I was packing for Coachella and this made my life so much easier because I was dealing with a health problem that made me very uncomfortable and not feel like myself. A month or so in advance, I was brainstorming things I wanted to pack and had come up with a preliminary list. Then as I was packing for the few days before leaving for the trip, I was adding as I went. Finally I finished everything on my list and I didn’t know what else to bring. I had to sleep and then leave in 6 hours lol. It was great!! I didn’t forget anything. 

I really like the layout of this app. Sometimes it can get confusing with lists and removing stuff in lists it asks you if you want it removed forever, i just ignore them and it seems to work out fine since i dont really need to pack for trips that frequently. It works well for when you want an app that’s not your Notes or Reminders app | This app is my CONSTANT GO TO to help me with my business and pleasure travels!
THANK YOU for being such an AWESOME APP!!!!!!!! | I’ve several other packing list apps and have settled on Packr. It just does packing lists and does it really well. I highly recommend it. Also their tech support is awesome. | Can’t get passed the first add. The X is so far off the edge you can’t close the add. 
USELESS GARBAGE. | You can’t get to the packing list.  Watch an ad that allows you to advance but the button to advance to the list page doesn’t work.  Honestly, it’s an app that tells you how many pairs of socks you should bring on a 3 day trip, why the ads?  Delete immediately. | it crashes on my macbook. too bad. I had used in the past | I am a very heavy packer. Though I’m still this way, this app has helped me improve greatly. It’s very cool how it tells you the number of things to bring like socks, and shirts, gives you the ability to add things and tailors needs to the weather forecast…which it also has. It’s been 5-Starts since I bought it and has continued to be with updated and new features added | Do not download. Interface commonly crashes and though it is ad centric, the ads are coded in such a way as not to allow access through once viewed. Lists aren’t generated. | Do not have what I need | It might just be me. I love the app, but I’m not sure how I see the other family members I added. How do I see the list for my son? | This app thinks of everything. You tell it where you’re going and for how long and it gives you the most thoughtful packing list ever. It thinks of every single thing you may need for your trip! I highly recommend it!! | The new version makes you pay to even make a list anymore. The old didn’t. BAD. Try Packing List: Trip Planner instead. | Greatest app of all humanity for packing! | I can’t print my list.  The option is there, but it closes the app and doesn’t bring up a list. This doesn’t help me. If you want to carry your phone while you pack, this may be fine. | App crashed and I lost my $4.99 for the upgrade to premium. | I use this app for every trip I take!   Perfectly organized and easy to use!   The only reason I gave four stars is because the local  attractions are not so local!   A trip to the Bahamas brings me activities to do near Greece! | Premium in app purchase doesn’t share with family, I bought it and thought my wife could share it with 1 purchase. Not fair and the sharing feature isn’t explained well. | I love this app for packing lists. I have used TripIt for a couple years for keeping track of travel info. This works well with that to help me prep and pack for those trips. I’m he suggested lists consider weather and what I will be doing (after I make selections) to make the list very practical. I can also add my own notes and modify the list as I see fit. I also love the ability to share a list. I’m his has been helpful for my husband and me as we can just check that app and make updates (instead of assuming the other grabbed it or grabbing double.) 

The only addition that would have been helpful for this trip is a section for pets. I could be similar to the section for babies, but including things like food, leash, crate, meds, etc. would be super helpful for those of us who have pets but don’t always travel with them. | I want the travel butler back!!!",4.61557,6009,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/5a/47/d3/5a47d3a3-b129-2949-ae98-0b5808b830e2/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/20/db/a2/20dba266-ba4a-1495-34ca-5835c161ac1f/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/1b/7c/78/1b7c78ab-a107-f5db-48ba-6f3b3ac46300/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/d6/02/46/d6024607-cb09-95bb-d0fa-4a215477bfbb/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/46/92/f3/4692f3bb-a142-449b-23b6-df29022df792/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/ab/64/4d/ab644d37-a1bb-93d6-b0d9-5256dc2fa9c2/f7009e51-8ea4-4437-848d-d61fa2542f93_EN_ipadPro129_1_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/71/4c/88/714c88ca-3f83-6194-0c3d-273436619c62/8cc8d6b5-ef74-48ef-95dc-c17f85df32b5_EN_ipadPro129_2_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/f5/ae/dd/f5aedd11-fe30-441c-79e9-7eb6395df7e9/8eba6cb9-4852-48ec-86f0-24b542ebb11d_EN_ipadPro129_3_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I get to the hotel and the the parking is really far from where you check in . The line to check in is ridiculously long. I waited over an hour. Finally I get to my room so I can chill . Within 10 min my eyes start watering and the sneezing starts. I noticed pet hair all Over the place . So I call the front desk to to let them know the situation. They informed me they are a pet friendly hotel. They changed my room and things didn’t Improve. I checked out a day early because I basically couldn’t breathe normally. All the reasons why not to use Hotels.com I have been try to get hold of someone to tell them my experience and see what they can do for me . This company has 0 customer service. Hopefully someone will see this review and get back to me. I won’t hold my breath. | I just downloaded your app.I can not access any listings.But on online I can access at a higher prices.I just left booking.com over being doubled charged for a cancellation.Are crooks too? | There is an issue.  It keeps popping up that I have several notifications.  They are all messages sent throughout the past four years from hotels.  It has them all marked as unread and I cannot get it to mark them as read.  As soon as I click on them, the revert to unread. | We had a great experience. Everything was very clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful especially Deborah in the breakfast area wouldn’t hesitate booking again. | Don’t use Hotels.com to book, they over book you and refuse to reimburse you even when the hotel agrees to reimburse because of it being their fault ! 
We showed up to our hotel with our son for his birthday with his friends and they didn’t have a room available at the hotel and stated we had to notify hotels.com to cancel and refund our money and we notified them right away and we were told that the refund couldn’t be granted because of rules and restrictions and the hotel has strict policies for this even though the hotel themselves told us to make sure we were refunded!!! | Horrible experience and hotels.com will not post my review. It does not contain profanity, room rates or personal info. I have pictures showing the awful room and they will not refund. This is a horrible company who is not truthful with reviews. They sensor reviews and allow reviews that are good to be posted but not the truthful ones that would make people not want to stay there!! Buyer beware!! | As always flawless and wonderful staff.
Thanks | You cannot use a hotels.com gift card to fully pay for a hotel that says you can pay in full with a gift card. Resort fees cannot be paid with a gift card | Impossible to get a live person. Extremely unsatisfied with app since taken over by Expedia | Easy to use web site. Prices were excellent. Room looks very pleasant and location is ideal. | The bed is very uncomfortable 
Lumpy & saggy 
 Room was clean. Check in was ez.
Service clerk was courteous, attentive, with 100 percent excellent customer service | I can’t figure out how to clear my messages. Very annoying | I need to talk to a live person to help with an issue that is not on the list of options from the virtual agent but it is impossible to get in touch with a live person | The hotel is situated ideally in the city. The rooms are very nice, the lounge is expansive, and the restaurant serves excellent meals. | Customer service is in shambles and the reward program is almost non existent. It’s greed bordering on thievery. I’m leaving and going to booking.com I cannot believe how awful this company is now. | Stayed here for a wedding weekend.  MVP Amanda was very accommodating and helpful with any needs we had to make the weekend special for all people in our group.  The hotel was clean and all staff was polite.  The only complaint I have, which seems to be every hotel we stay at these days, is housecleaning knocked on the door everyday between 8 and 9 wanting to clean.  This happened on the days we were booked to stay as well as the morning  we left.  The first day, we were sleeping in and didn’t answer right away so they came in anyway.  Checkout is not until 11, so I am not sure why they are knocking on the door prior to checkout.  I guess the only way around this is to put the Do Not Disturb sign out. | Overall, a clean, self-contained, economical place to lay down your head convenient to the magnificent Bryce Amphitheater. We didn’t get the note (email) from The Host, so upon arrival to the property in the middle of nowhere, we were greeted by a locked-up building with an orange pylon blocking the driveway. It was disconcerting and we felt marooned in Tropic as the sun set. We enjoyed the views from our car as we dealt with customer service and eventually got a call back from The Host. We were not stuck without prepaid accoms after all. 🥳 The unit has a front porch to take in the scenic views. The interior features a curious mishmosh of materials, including a corrugated metal shower. Bring your own hooks if you want to hang anything up. 😉 Appreciated the microwave oven and fridge. | Messages never clear after having been read.  I keep getting messages to contact hotels I have long since stayed at or canceled the reservation. | Perdi todas mis noches acumuladas , me comuniqué 3 veces con ellos y me dijeron que quedaría en 1 semana ahora que me comunico por que después de 6 meses no recibía mis noches , me dicen que no aplico , que no son transferibles | This family owned establishment made us feel welcome and important. They made us feel welcome and it was such a peaceful stay. | App is fine, but you can’t delete messages, or even make them read. It keeps showing up as unread. Stupid. | Steve was exceptional and made our stay the absolute best! Trey was also amazing as well as the ladies. Thank you all so much!! | This new one-key program is nice to be able to use it over several apps but the reward it self is terrible with the old reward system I was able to stay 10 nights and get a night free I travel a lot for work and personal and now with this terrible reward program I half to stay 65 nights to basically get a free night | But where? How? Poor site | 10 nights equaled a free night at an average nightly rate was an awesome plan.

Current “new” plan doesn’t offer anywhere near the same benefits and we are now utilizing other travel sites to ensure we are getting the best rates AND best benefits from multiple use.  Hard to say you have lost “some” of our business. | Staff was nice and check in process was quick. The parking lot was spacious and close to the rooms. The hotel room was clean, also the towels and the sheets. The closet room is huge. The bed was small for two people (full size). The towels are a little too small, ants were walking on the table, the curtains do not block the light from outside, and you can hear any noise from outside through the windows. Good TV and A/C. The room smell a little unpleasant upon entering. | We reserved a room at a low cost motel, it wasn’t a resort! In a bad area of town! Only a 2 floor motel! And we were charged a $200.00 resort fee! I will never book with Hotels.com again! | Our stay at Chasse Hotel was so enjoyable!  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The room was large and comfortable.  Breakfast was a wonderful selection of typical breakfast offerings and the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten! | I was quoted or suggested price would be $277.. and after checking 355.  
- was above my budget.  From the original quote. So I had to cut my trip short.. 
- recommend an app that will be at least a little closer to there suggest price.. 
this is not the one .. | Embassy suites did not have us booked as we were told by hotels.com Embassy suites worked it out for us and luckily they had a room. But it was a big hassle. Please follow through with hotel, hotels.com !!! | Awful will never use again after 15 years | From the second we arrived, we were greeted with a smile, and we were happily surprised to see that the hotel has bell service. everyone is well dressed and they have fresh flowers everywhere around the hotel. The room was clean and their coffee station was superb. We will definitely be back. | The fact you advertise and sell these disgusting crack hotels on your site is embarrassing. Do better. | Is a rep who works for hotel.com and based on his work and how he “helped” me ill never use this app again. Humans can’t be humans. | The I couldn’t talk to a real person and after years of using the app I keep getting a message that sorry something’s wrong on our end and no one to help me get my app working again or informing me what the problem is. | I haven’t been able to successfully make a reservation through the app multiple times. Not happy with the new rewards either. | Excellent staff and very clean / quiet room. Good breakfast also makes this a nice value. Thanks! | Easy to use to see a variety of hotels. | I searched rooms for same night tonight with checkout tomorrow. It filtered results and I chose one just to find out it changes the dates once you click on the hotel room you’re wanting. I chose to pay now and it was non refundable. The dates they booked weren’t tonight they were Wednesday! I’m so displeased. | Clean and basic room, good quality for a low price. Breakfast is a bit misleading- only tea/ coffee, packaged muffins and oatmeal. We were definitely expecting a little more. | Very basic room. Bathroom door didn’t close 
Older property.  No hot breakfast.  Just okay but cute breakfast area. | Booked a lovely hotel with a view of the Marina in the heart of town ending up with a freeway view on the edge of town but it was the same price! Thanks hotels.com! | I hate this one key cash. You were able to get a free stay quicker than this one key cash. I have been a loyal customer for years. While trying to search for a hotel, the boxes in which the hotels sit fill the page and cuts off crucial information like the price. The app was working perfectly until the developers tried to make it better | Great app !!! | Room was great. The layout is perfect. The downside is the noise - you hear everything from the street. The AC units are outdated as well. They are so loud that you literally have to turn them off at night and hopefully the coolness doesn’t escape through the doors. The weatherstripping needs to be replaced on the doors as well. | Perfect Inn on a quiet street. Walkable to everything!! | On 411 my Card ending in 1572 was debited $119.02 that I didn’t authorize ant the the Holiday Inn Express Charged me  …. Why  why hasn’t my 119.02 be put back on my card  I’ll never use Hotel.com again and FYI this is Nicks Father who payed for his stay …… Dam Shame 👎👎👎👎 | There was what looked like a public hair in the mini fridge in the room. | Because of the great reviews for this Hotel it led me to book a one night stay.

The interface is well designed making it easy to quickly add new trips.  I especially like that there are several ways to display my travel history through maps, photos, timelines or through various statistics.   I tried several other travel journaling apps and Pin Traveler by far is the best app for my needs. | Five times | Pin Traveler is an amazing app for anyone who wants to track all of the information on their trips. I was previously using a spreadsheet to track my trips and this app takes it to a new level. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to have a digital record of their trips or plan new trips. | Very little features that are engaging. I paid and then canceled membership before it renewed (months before annual subscription would expire) and was never able to oh back in. It’s an annual subscription and I got about a month of it. | I have been using Pin Traveler for a number of years and it just keeps getting better and better.  I can easily organize my pins into trips with discreet stops and select my own master image for the trip if I choose.  With descriptions for each stop I can incorporate trip journal items.  Trips now show a line connecting all stops in sequence which is so valuable.  I also organize all my trips images across pins.  

I have 279 pins across 67 countries so indeed it is a must for me.

As important, the developers for pin traveler continue to be receptive to suggestions. | This is such a great way to document and journal all of your travel | I love this app!  I have been anle to pin every place I have been  over my lifetime!  With the new categories you can now now customize it for your special places, like my UNESCO Wirld Heritage Sites. | I used to keep a travel map with pins, but it became awkward and outdated.  I looked for a replacement and found Pin Traveler when I'd just begun an island cruise to Greece.  I loved dropping pins for every island and historic site I visited.  I loved it so much that I purchased the Lifetime Membership within days of installing it. 

I gave it only four stars, as I sometimes find navigating the features awkward and non-intuitive.  Reading the help solves some of that, but my biggest hurdle is lumping pins into a single trip.  And once a pin is dropped, it's hard (for me) to add it to a trip.  I'm hoping a new feature including easy to create and edit multi-stop trips will be added.

Additionally, since Apple has made it possible for some iPhone apps to work on Macs as well, I have been trying this out on an M2 MacBook Pro. It seems to work well, is stable, and using the trackpad as a ""pinch and drag"" device works well. 

I hghly recommend thi app, and I look forward to the updates and improvements coming soon. | What a great app! I really like a record of places I’ve traveled to. Thanks! | Amazing app that lets you track your travels! Customer support is swift and reliable! Highly recommend! | I was looking for an easy way to track the places, states, cities, and countries that I have been to and experienced over my lifetime. Doing it the “old fashioned way” of pinning a world map was no longer working for me. I came upon the Pin Traveler app and quickly discovered that it is a great tool! Full disclosure, I recently needed to extend the app to my iPad and admittedly mistyped my email address. I reached out to the app owner and they were very swift and helpful! I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys traveling! | Simple and easy to use with room for improvement. | This is a perfect tool to keep track of your travels. It is easy to use, and works as advertised. Fun! | I've been looking for a substitute for TripAdvisor's Travel Map for some time.  This is it. These guys have a simple, clean, and robust platform. Unlike trip advisor they are extremely helpful and the data is yours...not trapped behind some protected server.  I'm moving all my pins over now and they even have offered to help make the switch!  

Thanks guys. Great App. | Excellent, but how would you even be able to obtain the North Korea flag(unless you’re an important person)? | It’s very hard to use. I keep changing the color of the pins…….they are still red. | If you have been to more than 50 places you have to pay! No thanks! Removing app from my device! | The title of my review says it all. You cannot do anything without joining so it was wasted time to download. | This is by far the best travel journal I have!
I tried mutiple ones and this is the only one
 I ended up keeping and loving! Sure you have to pay for a lifetime premium but it's like buying yourself a travel diary and it will store all your memories forever! Every feature that I wanted on a travel diary is on this app! Add as many photos to every country you went too, pin places you've been to in that country and you can even specify which city you went to and also add photos and pins to that specific city!

The developers are very responsive and has good communication when I had problems. They never leave it unresolved!

This app has gotten better with the updates since I started using it back and 2021! Love love love this app! I can't wait to see what it has to offer this year! 
Loving the new Valentines heart pin, btw 🩷 | This is a great way to document your travels. I have been using this app for almost a year and it is my go to travel app. I document all my trips on the app, add tons of pictures and now it even has a route map which is very cool. The two developers are always working on new ideas and are very receptive to suggestions. You can even go back in and put in past trips and countries you have visited. Can’t say enough for this app!! | This program supercharges the old concept of putting pins in a map. The zoom in zoom out feature on the world maps gives a fantastic ability to see an overview or detail of places visited. The number of countries visited or the percentage of countries in the world visited allows a clear picture of how far your travels have taken you. Truly outstanding for a visualization of your travel history. | I have wanted and easy way to keep track of all the places I have been and this is sooooo it! I searched through so many apps like it but they were all way too complicated and not as easy to use as pin traveler! Totally recommend for any traveler. The only thing that I don’t like is that premium is expensive. I would totally get it because I love the app but I’m a broke student traveler who is spending all my money on new trips soooo I can’t spend the money but maybe one day! Love this app though! Totally recommend! | Best travel destination tracking app ever. | Premium kinda dumb, too expensive but nothing is that much better, it is worth it for the memories | The first explore I got for a place had as #1 a restaurant across a river from the neighborhood I chose. It also listed a place that has been closed for three years. | Une superbe application pour suivre nos voyages et se rappeler des chemins parcourus ! | Such a user friendly way to keep all your travel locations (and possibly memories) in one place. Every time I open the app I get a big picture of where I want to go next. | You will be limited to 50 pins if you don’t pay for some version. | Was so great until they put all of the features that used to be free behind a pay wall. You barely get any access without paying $25/year. Don’t download it. | Gives you a max of 50 pins then wants money. Really? $2.99 a week??  Other options and all over priced. Deleting after posting review | I am a frequent International traveler. Pin traveler has been a joy to use to keep track of countries and cities I have visited. 

I recently had to resolve a question about my subscription and the guys at Pin Traveler were a pleasure to deal with, very quick responses, and everything was straightened out immediately. 

Great app with excellent customer service. I highly recommend it to anyone who travels and would like to easily keep a log of their journeys. | I like it, it works as advertised
I really use it just for the pin feature to see almost the exact places I’ve been but it’s pretty cool 👍 | I’m addicted to this app. It’s exactly what I’ve been looking for to document my travels! This app would be perfect if you could list the places costed such as restaurants etc like you can fit the cities costed instead of having to tap into a city pin. | By far the best ""places traveled"" app. I use it very simply (just pin places I've been and then wishlist places I want to go to) but it's perfect and elegant and doesn't pressure you too spend money. And the nifty extra features are very cool. Thank you for making this!!! | 50 free pins, then $40 to continue. Would have been nice to know in the beginning. Delete. | Finally after years of looking for a travel diary, and over 10 travel diary apps downloaded and removed, I finally found what I’m looking for. This has everything I have searched for, all the features I looked for, finally found in this one app. This app should be renamed “Pin Travel Journal Diary. For years I would search apps with search keywords “travel diary” or “travel Journal” in the apple App Store and unfortunately this app never popped up. I believe its due to the keyword “pin”. This app is amazing! It has the capability of so much! These features include, jotting down your travel experiences like you would in a travel journey, you adding photos, Pinning locations on world map, display country flags that you visited, notates the number of places visited, provides a wishlist of places you want to visit, there is so much more! The one thing that I believe this app should try to include in the future is the ability to create a photo book. This would be another benefit or option to be available for users. I love this app. Thank you developers! | Only allows 50 destinations for free version.. pretend users to pay iver $20/year for full service | I found this app a couple of years ago and I love it! It is such a great way to keep track of all our travels around the world. | Can’t type in national parks or smaller towns. Only allows pins of major cities. Rather useless. | I use this to document each new city that I send an order to with my business. I love keeping track on how far my designs have reached around the world. Thank you!! 🧡 | Limiting free users to only 50 destinations is a waste of my time. | They want annual subscription for you to map more than 50 pins.   Very disappointed. | Don’t appreciate being told about about costs associated with this app after you register into an account | This app is good but they can improve you should be able to type In a address.and you should be able to put pictures on the address 
For free. | I have a job role that allows me to travel, plus I have always liked to get out and see the world. Using Pin Traveler is a great way to keep track, I would recommend it to anyone. | I like the app and especially the potential of the app as they make improvements. Using this as our trip journal. Can just click on a stay and see note Anne’s photos related specifically to that stay. You can also just see your total status across many trips. Very responsive to my email. | Been looking for an app like this for years. Really happy to have found it. Great place to memorialize trips and to add places to visit in the future.  Support was really helpful too. Love this app!!! | This is such a great app but it’s very confusing to use in order to get stats on your various trips. | Limits you to 50 places then tries to rip you off for their subscription

No clean towels 
No clean sheets
No bath mat
No sweeping of floors
Bathroom not cleaned

Every night after a long day of working had to back to front desk to ask for laundry .
Had a evening shift manager who had a really bad attitude, acted as thu he did not have time to give me clean towels. Did not come out from the office behind the counter, as asked “ what do you want now”
House keeping fell down on their customer cleaning check list every day 
We had an extended stay . Noticed after one price it kept getting higher and higher.
This hotel did not meet any of the guidelines set forth in the IHG guidelines of quality and customer care.
This hotel needs to be removed from your list of supported hotels. 
We will be looking at the recommendations from IHG much closer. If we use you at all.
This the second bad hotel I have stayed at in the IHG program.  Will be checking my options else where.. oh I am a gold member 
Gayle Tye | Just love this hotel and its proximity to Old Sacramento. | Easy to use an enjoyable software program I enjoy staying at your motels thank you. | Great app for getting hotels globally! | Your app freezes up constantly! | Very limited options. Extremely expensive. | Great app.   Very easy to make reservations all with free cancellation | I’m renting again because I loved the place and service. | What happened to the Digital Check In on the App? I was a really used tool for business travelers. Please bring it back. | Ez | Wish IHG had their own map with their hotels listed or work with WAZE to have that as an option to make it easier while traveling by showing which hotel and for what rate. | Have over 58,000 points and could not use them! This is a nice hotel, would be nice to be able to use my points. | Haven’t booked in a long time. Just remember how easy you all made it for me !! Thanks Rob | This app allows for quick and easy travell. | Excelente aplicación y acceso a reservar hotel. | There needs to be someway to add the name of the second person also staying in the room to the reservation.  So That person who may arrive earlier than the primary can check in without difficulty.  (Hilton offers this feature on their app!) | Took me 10 minutes to book a room. When I called reservation phone number another ten minutes.  Your time is obviously more valuable than mine. | So easy to reserve a room and finding a great price! | This app makes it difficult to determine if points can be used and at what level.  

Additionally, the non-refundable rates are not well explained.  What if I need to move my date? 

Seems intentional. | Become a member NOW !! | Booking is nice and easy online real convenient for me thank you! | How does one use Award points? I cannot find a place on this App to indicate that I want to use some of my points accumulated. | Terrible policy that if you don’t have activity in 12 months, your points expire. That is simply pitiful and greedy!! | The scan a credit card feature is an exercise in futility. | My previously earned points were not honored, I’m giving you guys a chance to make things right. Please use my email and link my points. | Easy reservations wiyh apl | It consistently logged you out and forget your password what a piece of garbage I would not recommend this Anyone | The IHG App is straightforward and easy to use. | Good stag | I search for a hotel, then it tells me I’m not logged in. So I have to go back to the beginning and log in. 

At some point, it could say not logged in. Sometime before ‘book’ | You have to go through the screens in a specific order, or start over. Too much trouble. | Great tool for last minute bookings! | I traveled extensively over a 43 year career, and stayed at IHG hotels most of the time.  I am retired now and still prefer IHG properties whenever I am traveling. | Clean and friendly staff | As a diamond elite member I’ve stayed over 300 nites with HIE and can honestly say never had an issues. 
PLUS 
Sausage Gravy Biscuits r best in the South | I stayed here a few weeks ago. The place is clean, the staff friendly, and they had a good breakfast. I am planning on staying here again in a week for 2 more nights. I highly recommend | Best booking experience!  Thank you! | MY EXPERIENCE THEIR BE SO AMAZING | There’s no shortage of choices of hotels, but we stay at IHG locations almost exclusively. The exception being when none is in a specific area… which is rare. Clean, comfortable, convenient, and reasonably priced. 

One day, we’re going to book a week long vacation, using just our accumulated points. (We’re almost there.) | In trying to book a reservation today with a Boeing Employee Discount, we were offered the rate through the Boeing Program Website and when we went to pay, it said rate not available. Called IHG, and they did not care to honor. Directed me to member rate which while cheaper than what they would give for “switched” Boeing rate, was still more than what was originally offered. I will for sure be letting Boeing Program Administrator as well as Administrator for another Corporate Client Rate within our family that the use of IHG should be taken under reconsideration. | I’ve always had issues with this app. The latest is it’s inability to pull up any options when I search “Monterey, CA.” Figured out I need to search for hotels in SAN FRANCISCO (won’t even pull them up for San Jose) and then scroll down. Ridiculous. | This was one of the warmest welcome to the Four Seasons Hotel. EVER!!!! Attentive and Helpful | I paid over $1000.00 for a little over a 180,000 points, I’m using the points + money system using over 140,000 points and still have to paid over $1000.00 for a 7 days stay. This is a scam and quite disturbing! | Often have lots of points but no point rooms available thinking of going to another priority club | Clean and nice rooms, front desk and hotel workers all kind and helpful.  Beds very comfortable and breakfast tasty. Last night in Santa Fe and was really impressed with front desk manager’s helpfulness Ant ( sp?) | You are gonna get a call after you book an IHG room from Holiday Inn Club Vacations . Don’t sign up for a discounted vacation. It’s a scam scam scam for a timeshare company. You pay 249 bucks for a vacation to book later. But there’s tons of taxes and fees later to book it. Yuck | Pets allowed filter checkbox should be front & center right below number of persons. See Hotels dot com website. Also on credit card info you should add month number next to month name. Your app has only month name. Maybe it’s just me, but the booking experience would be 10 times better with these to simple fixes. | These hotels have always been there for me and my family, I continue to depend on staying with IHG anywhere I go on vacation or just going for a weekend trip. Best places, breakfast is a plus for us and the comfortable beds and clean rooms. The hotels are also always clean and I’m always welcomed when I enter the hotel.

Packing List Checklist is an easy to use app that provides you with a checklist of all the important things to consider and pack before traveling.

——— PICK SUGGESTED ITEMS ———
 
Get up and running with very little effort by using our Pick Suggested Items feature.

You will be able to pick items from these categories: Essentials, Accessories, Baby, Backpack / Carry On, Beach, Camping, Clothing, Electronics, Food, Healthcare, Makeup, Shoes, Toiletries and many more!

That's it: your list will be ready without any typing involved!

——— SYNC YOUR LISTS ———
 
Created your list on your iPad but want to check it on your iPhone? Got a new iOS device and want to see your lists there?

With iCloud sync we've got you covered: your lists will be with you on all your iOS devices as long as you are using the same Apple ID in them.

——— SET REMINDERS ———

Want to make sure that you are not leaving anything behind? Just set up a reminder, get a notification at the right time and relax!

——— MANAGE ITEM QUANTITIES ———
 
Set the quantities for your Packing List items.
 
——— TO DO & TO PACK ———
 
After a lot of research we reached the conclusion that the best way to go through your travel preparation is to distinguish the actions that you need to take before and during travel from the things that you need to pack.
 
That’s why each list has two sections: To-Do & To Pack.
 
——— CREATE YOUR OWN CATEGORIES ———
 
Organize your items by grouping them into different categories.
You will be able to create as many categories as you need, and you can pick an emoji to better differentiate them.
 
——— REUSE YOUR EXISTING LISTS ———
 
This is one of the best kept secrets of every seasoned traveller. Keep refining your list, and reach sorcerer-level packing skills. You’ll soon forget why you ever packed for your travels differently in the past!

Paid premium and now it doesn’t work and app is completely shut down. So much for lifetime access. | I’ve tried to use the app recently and it keeps force closing and I have the premium version that I paid for a year ago used a few times and haven’t use it after since it keeps force closing on me | I really appreciated this app, but there’s a now months-old issue that causes the app to crash and revert to an earlier (empty) version of the list I was working on upon reloading. So now it’s useless and was a waste of money. | Such a shame. Used to love this app. customer support seems like it’s only on Twitter which I don’t use. Hope it is fixed soon. | Previously this app worked great. When I went to use it more my up coming trip this time I can’t even get it to open. It crashes right away. Did some trouble shooting with no luck. Hopefully this is just a bug and gets fixed but as of the moment the app is unusable for me. | The app no longer opens after the last update. | This app has helped me a lot to remember what I need to pack !!!!!!!! So easy and perfect for any packing !!!!!! | I loved this app, but after my last update, it no longer opens. So frustrating to pay for an app that doesn’t get updated. 

Apple should require developers to indicate a commitment to updates so users know which are worth the investment. 

I’m happy to change my review if the app is updated. I’ve lost years of well-developed lists. No longer a happy customer. | Have used it many times. Love the layout. Very clear, simple. Like the flexibility of changing items, duplicating lists, making new lists, categorization of items | Wish I had found this earlier | I got my new iPhone and now it won’t even open. There are no new updates available so I guess I have lost all my precious lists | Had to reinstall to new iPhone, previous purchase not restored and they forced me to buy the app again!  Use another packing list app.  This one is not worth the frustration! | Nice app but the delete/trash can icon doesn’t work which super annoying. | Nice app, but lists I create on my phone are not showing up on my iPad. | I loved this app, but after upgrading to iOS 17 it no longer works, just crashes immediately. | I just upgraded to premium but I can’t find out how to use the extra features. | So far its fantastic | This app was great. It worked well, was easy to use, and was free. But I just got an iPhone 14 and now I can’t open it. | This app, which I used faithfully for years and even purchased premium features on, appears to no longer be supported. With the new IOS update the app will no longer open. | After looking for awhile I finally found this app.  I really like how I can make & keep my lists.  Simplify’s my life so much . | Great app. Easy to use. Worked well until I got a new iPhone 14. Now it won’t open. | How do I synch my iphone from my iPad? Don’t see any instructions. | Purchasing the new Apple 15 Pro Max made a number of my purchased apps not work any longer; especially my list for packing with Triplist. It also allowed the weather app to work with it so I know what type of clothing to bring. They didn’t keep it up but I at least had my dates of my trips and my list of items needed for each trip. Then it made it so that wouldn’t work, and I had to delete it along with all my trips, dates, and where I went along with the weather. I would love this app to follow in its place.  I would like to be able to personalize this app a little bit like put in background picture of each trip and add the weather even if it’s in Europe, etc. But I’m happy I found some thing that works so I don’t forget important items. | I absolutely love this app and have used it for years now. Favorite features include being able to duplicate checklists and/or pick items from other ones; customize to-do’s; add emojis to categories and easily make changes to categories; uncheck all items if using the same list. It’s super user-friendly and flexible. | I’ve been using it for a few years and love the ability to copy from one trip to another to create a new list, the ability to share lists with someone else who’s on the pro version, and overall its versatility. Highly recommend. | I really love this app. Definitely worth upgrading. It’s easy to use and syncs across iOS devices. We have different packing lists for different types of trips. And for backpacking we breakdown what goes where in our packs. Wish list: web or max interface. List sharing with your packing partner. | I was ashen when this app started collapsing at start.  Assumed I had lost all my lists.

Came to check the reviews, see if other people were having the same issue.  

Someone said they deleted and reinstalled.  
Tried it, and all is good again.  

When in doubt, unplug and plug it back in, right?

Data was stored in the cloud, so I didn’t lose anything there. | Worked ok for what it was for a while- now all my lists are lost because the app crashes whenever i open it. User beware- you’ll want to back everything up if you use this. | Love this app that stopped working on my iPhone. Luckily worked on iPad. After much frustration I installed on iPhone and reinstalled and it now works!!  So glad to have this fabulous app that I’ve relied on for years working again! | Love this app but it isn’t opening on my phone? What’s going on??? | I have several checklists and packing lists stored in this app. Now I can’t even open it. Can you please at least update the app so we can export our lists rather than losing them entirely? | It no longer backs up or even syncs to iCloud like it used to do. Total disappointment. | I’ve checked for updates and there’s none. When I click on the app and goes back to my home screen. Not even working. | Got a new iPhone and now the app will not open at all | Getting ready for trip and tired of forgetting something so looked for a packing list app. Downloaded a bunch, paid and free. Some too confusing, some way to basic. I didn’t want to spend a lot, or do a subscription. This had a very reasonable one-time fee. Installed on both iPad & iPhone. Made my first list on my iPad, and when I opened the app on my phone, my list was there, instantaneously! Really impressed! | I’ve been using this to keep track of stuff in our camper.  I have 2 sun-headings of each location: one is the stationary provisions (what I have bought or need to buy for that “room”), and the second is the high dollar or perishable items that need to be transported back and forth. I use different icons for each room for at a glance comprehension and feet icon for the transfer stuff.   It’s helped me a ton with all the little things you forget otherwise (cleaners that are stored at home to over-winter, Vitamix, tools, staples like sugar, etc)!
Biggest drawback is haven’t figured out how to keep the list synched between hubby’s and my phone. | Can copy and paste lists, specify numbers of items (e.g. 2 t-shirts). Can look at all items in a list or only those items not yet packed. Very useful. | Aplicativo muito simples e intuitivo. Ajuda com tarefas simples e mantém minha cabeça no lugar na preparação de uma viagem ou evento. Interface limpa e bem pensada, sem propagandas aparecendo do nada e tudo muito simples. | I love the Pack app! I bought it in 2021 to help me pack for a girls’ trip with my besties. I’ve used it countless times more for other trips like to go to Disney World, on cruises, road trips to see family, and weekend getaways. You can either have one primary list for every trip and just check off the things you won’t need and go from there, or you can create separate lists for the different kinds of trips you take and who you have going with you, if you need to pack for them. Gone are the days of buying shampoo and conditioner at the resort gift shop (ugh, so expensive) or my son going commando because I forgot to pack his underwear (oops). Then, there are checklists for all the to-do things before the trip. Shave your winter legs (LOL), wax the eyebrows, set up transportation at the destination of flying… Extremely helpful! Pack is the best reminder app of all. | App used to open and now it doesnt | Used to love this but now it doesn’t even open any more. Sad to see. | There’s no way to create an account. The app kept crashing on iPhone. Had to delete and download again. All lists are gone - hours and hours of work… | Used it for years and loved it. Recently it quit opening on both my iPhone and iPad and won’t open on my wife’s devices either. Bad update? | It loads again and works. | I use this for every trip. My packing lists evolve, adding things, taking things off, but I never have to start from scratch. Thank you for this fantastic tool. | I use this app for every single trip. I honestly don’t know what I did before. It’s super easy to use and works great! | The developer responded to my email about retrieving info from the cloud. I haven’t tried it because I ended up starting over. But I did appreciate the response and the effort to address my problem! Still love the app!
********
Ok I got the app to load but other reviewers are right- nothing comes back from the cloud. I had to start all over. I’ll never update this app again. 
******** 
This app is so incredibly useful that I purchased premium! But I did the update and now it won’t open! 😣 | I’m glad to see an update. I use this app all the time. | No help or developer help or features. Or even email replies. Regret paying for premium. If you’re looking for a tool that, as one example, allows you to sync lists with your spouse, family, friends, the native Reminders app meets the need, whereas this app does not. A let down.

It's a clean and simple route planner for roadtrippers and campers like you - no matter if you map out your annual cross-country road trip or you live the #vanlife dream and explore the world in your campervan. Nothing beats the freedom of the open road.

PLAN MULTI-STOP ROUTES

Plan your trip itinerary on an interactive map and pin as many locations on the map as you need. Search locations of attractions, trails, or national parks and save points of interest in a list. You can now add your personal notes to every stop.

SEE DISTANCES & DRIVING TIMES

See distances connecting the road trip waypoints and know the driving times between multiple stops. Easily plan your time on the road and your gas and fuel consumption.

SHARE YOUR TRIP (like Google My Maps)

Share your trip and collaborate with friends on finding the most interesting sights and the best places to stay the night.

FIND PLACES ALONG THE ROUTE (like Roadtrippers)

Use search shortcuts to quickly find good restaurants, interesting sights or good value campsites. Type ""pizza"" or ""burger"" in the search to display these places on the map. Or just click on any place or POI in the map and add it to your list of stops or starred places.

MARK FAVORITE PLACES

Star places to visit and save them for later on the interactive map. You can add a note to be reminded of why you want to visit this place. Once you are on the highway or you map out your next road trip it is easy for you to see if one of your saved places is nearby and you can add it to your route.

USE OFFLINE & NAVIGATE

Change the order of places to visit with an easy-to-use drag-and-drop. Use the app offline while you drive on the highway and never miss out on attractions and sights along your route. Start the navigation with one click in your preferred navigation app and get driving directions in Apple Maps, Google Maps or Waze.

EXPORT & IMPORT YOUR ROUTES

You can make a backup of all of your routes by exporting them in GPX format. You can import them into Google My Maps or share them with friends.

So pleased to have everything at our fingertips vs having to use 4 different apps for things like gas stations, rest stops and offbeat attractions.  

Well done | I’ve used Roadie twice to take a long road trip, and loved it both times. it’s extremely easy to use simply plug in your destinations and add them to your route. it offers a way to kind of schedule/rearrange your itinerary, which is extremely helpful. You can use the itinerary to plan out how long each day will be or what you plan on doing each day of your trip. I did what seem to be bugs in certain areas. For example I was planning a trip that was going on the “Going to The Sun” road and for some reason it kept calculating the route going around the whole park to the other side. | I can’t fully commit to paying for premium if I can’t see what I am paying for.  I need an app I can commit to for my trips. There’s not enough with the free version to make an informed decision.  So I will go with the competitor RoadTripper. With that I can see what I am paying for. Too bad. I was open to trying something different from the usual. 

Unfortunately they lost me as a customer from the beginning.  Maybe in the future they’ll change this and I can consider them for my next series of trips. 

Roadie if your reading this, please consider. | Free version is worthless. Maybe it’s better if you pay. | I would use this app over Google maps but they make you pay just to invite your friends to your map which is kinda stupid considering that majority of the times you are going to want to share with friends | Love the idea, but tons of little issues that make it super annoying to try and use. Definitely not subscribing for another month but I appreciate their efforts. Maybe in another few iterations it'll get to a product that feels pleasant to use. | What is the point of this app VS just going straight to Apple Maps?  This still just takes you to Apple Maps and in fact makes it a lot less seem-less. Bugged I wasted my money because I forgot to cancel before trail was up and was charged for a full year. Not sure where they got all their good reviews. | The app was everything I wanted while planning my road trip from Kentucky to Utah and California!  Super easy to use and works great, and I like that I was able to name stops and split it up into sections so it made it easy to keep track of what day I was planning each stop! | I’ve spent 15 minutes playing and find it way to lacking on everything. I cannot even find the way to read the step by step instructions for a route.

Very minimal web site also. Not discussion that I see about the Premium at all.

Not enough reviews to be rated after 3 years.

I feel they need a macOS app as I prefer using a real keyboard and a larger screen display to plan my trips. Yes, the iPad app will run on an M1 Mac albiet in a tiny screen window.

I'll stick with the great Road Trip Planner - far more features. | After easily installing, I had issues with the app. Mainly text and print not lining-up correctly. Deleted and will stick with Waze. | Used the app for road-tripping all over the West. Convenient and effective. The developers are accessible and ultra responsive. Totally worth the upgrade! | I thought I would be able to put in multiple stops and build a itinerary but, I don’t think it allows and the app is not user friendly. | ဆက်မသုံးတော့ဘူး | This is the app I would have made - super fast, clean, simple, but still has everything you need to plan a trip. Extremely well done, I bought the lifetime immediately (thank you for having that as an option and not forcing me into a subscription plan). | Just getting started. So far, simple & easy to read. | Not paying for an app that you can't try first. | I was hoping to import a trip into this app hoping to use some of its features, but all I get is an error. Tried several different trip files and restarting ect, but nothing has worked. Wish I could get the $30 bucks back. | Very disappointed the the paid version of this app. I was hoping to use the app to plan ahead and see stops to add along the way. We are going from texas to Florida, I mapped the route, clicked hotels and it showed a group of hotels in north Arkansas (a state we are not even entering). The companies soliton is too zoom in, piece by piece rather being able to conclusively plan the trip, we have too basically look 4-5 times but by bit. There is not way better than any free app such as Google Maps to plan a route. In fact google maps actually shows things “along the route”. | Easy to use and share plans.
Wish I could plan day of driving or have app auto plan days. Seeing upcoming weather and better ‘attractions’ highlights would make it a killer app. | Hard to navigate, adds stops out of order and you can’t change them. It’s impossible to sort out. Canceling | Can’t find and add stops, can’t get alternative routes for entire trip. | Love this app.. work better than road warriors | We downloaded the app to find scenic routes, and interesting things along the way. Attractions, Gas Stations, Campsites, Hotels, Parks, etc. are all behind the paywall. Without purchasing the premium subscription, it’s a less useful map app. | This app is paid app when most are free | I love the interface. Very easy to use and can search for just about anything I type into the map search. The smart insert feature is also great when adding a new point to your route in the middle. It gives you estimated miles and times between your points so you know how long/far you will be traveling any leg. Your can save trip routes for planning more than one trip at a time (2 in free version, infinite in purchased version). 
As I pull a travel trailer (RV) for my trips, there are a few things I would like to see added and be able to test in the free version before I purchase the upgrade.
1- allow specs of my travel trailer (length, height, weight, propane on board) to be entered so the app can map around any low clearance bridges, weight limited roads, propane limited tunnels, hairpin turns, etc. to be sure the road mapped is safe for travel with my RV.
2- ability to identify specified miles and/or time travel down a route so that a campground/stay search can be done in that area. Currently, I take a guess by sight, add a random stay point to the route and see how long/far it takes to get there. If wrong, remove point, guess further up or back and repeat until my miles/time is close to what I want to travel in a leg. It’s functional but could be made much easier if the app can just pin a point in the route at how far/long you want to travel as an option.

With these 2 functionality adds, this app would be worth purchasing for me. | I hate that so many apps these days say they’re free but once you start trying to maneuver around the app, you find out you can’t do much of anything without paying some monthly or annual fee. | After paying for the app, as the free version would not allow me to complete my trip, I found it kept rerouting me to roads I did not want to travel on. Would not allow me to select the road I wanted. It is like a section of the road did not exist even though it shows the road on the map. I attempted to use the Contact Us (send an email) and it does not work. Fortunately they only got one months worth of payment out of me. The trip I am planning is on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Once you purchase the app they provide a sample trip of the Blue Ridge Parkway and it is jacked up too.

Update:  after contacting the developer they did a great job of explaining the issue and provide a resolution. Response from developer was fast and professional. I will continue to use the app for my upcoming trips. | When I opened the app, it grabbed a location near me from GPS and made it my home location. When I attempted to change it to my actual address, I was prompted to upgrade to the full version to be able to do so. Really? How are you supposed to plan a trip without setting a starting point?

Failure to be able to change even the most basic information without paying for the full version renders the app unusable to me. I can understand that adding locations, or notes, would require an update to the full version, but preventing a user from setting up a basic profile is pretty unforgivable. Deleting this app immediately! | This is not a very good user friendly app and I wish I had never purchased it!!!! Sad :-( | So easy to use. Can’t wait to plan more trips | Was trying to plan a road trip from Illinois - Oregon - California - Oregon - Illinois and this app was just perfect for giving us the ability to plan out stops for fuel, find great rest stops along the way and even some crazy attractions.
I would recommend this app to anyone who is wanting to plan any kind of road trip. On my trip back to Illinois, I was able to follow Rte 66 and see all of the attractions that I have been wanting to go see. 
The only thing that I had to watch out for was when finding the next stop on my route was that the ‘Smart Add’ feature sometimes inserted the stop in the wrong place so it had me going backwards at a couple of points. But other than that, this is a great app. Thanks for making it happen. | Downloaded the free version, worthless, doesn’t make me want to pay for upgrade, put locations in bizarre order, making the trip twice as long as needed, says you can tap and drag to change order of places? How? Guess you have to pay?
Useless! | This app would be a 10/10 if it had landscape mode!!!

Update: landscape mode added! It’s awesome now. | Love the concept. It started basic but getting better and it appears the developers listened to feedback and have since updated the app to make it even better. | The app says it works on iPad and iPhone.  I downloaded it on my iPad.  It wouldn’t orient itself with the iPad.  It only works when the iPad is held vertically.  My case prevents that.  I then tried it on my iPhone X.  I was able to creat an account.with no trouble.  However, when I tried to actually use the app, it would send me to location services in settings.  This continued even after I enabled everything for the app.  I’ve defeated the app and will look for one that I can actually plan trips on. | Handles multiple stops very elegantly, love that collaboration is now possible. Overall very intuitive to use. Would love to see a smart order feature that orders all stops in a route and/or section, and would also be a nice to have to calculate the price of fuel for the trip. 

Once you’re on the road I could also see a good feature being what is easily accessible for the next 5 or so exits. Often we’re looking for a bathroom or something to eat and by the time we figure out whether it’s on our side of the freeway we’ve passed the exit 😂

Glad to have this app, and have had a lovely experience with any communication with the development team. | This is a great simple app for planning a road trip. Love the design and simplicity, and the developer is very responsive to feedback. | It’s an app that just draws a line from one place to another, and you can add stops along the way. Not much else.

When you want to access flight details you really need you have to scroll endlessly. | Used to be my favorite app for travel things. Now just deleted it. First never finds flight info under booking number anymore, and now every time you open app you need to type in your email and get a code which is stupid if you can set up Face ID Touch ID or whatever but not that stupid way. Disappointed and deleted it. | I attempted to give this app a try. I should have read the reviews first. There is limited synch with this app. This app does NOT Work. Pass it by. There is NO tutorial or how to use guide. You are guessing at this. | This app used to be great, giving you updates on your flight in the airport. Now it doesn’t even register an itinerary!
Looking at the positive reviews, they are from 5-6 years ago, now this app has become useless! | I’ve been using the KAYAK app and wanted to try this one out. However, unlike KAYAK, which seems to ingest confirmation emails that are forwarded to it quite flawlessly, this app does not. Therefore, it makes things more difficult. Otherwise it has a slick interface. | The app was merely spammy and full of ads in the past; after the ‘update’ it is deprived of features, full of bugs, and still spammy. Doesn’t show anything when offline at foreign airports. That’s when you need the app the most. Trips can’t get deleted in the app once added through the chat bot! I’ve cancelled flights and can’t remove them. When opening the app and swiping through flights, the app jumps to the first flight in the list randomly. Ridiculous programming. Trips can’t be added to calendar any longer. Trips don’t get update when the date for a booking number has changed (changed flight with airline) Today I received five times the same spam notification urging me to book a lounge through the app or their website. This app has become utterly useless, frustrating, and annoying (notification spam). Avoid! | Super annoying SLOW Assistant based interface - just give us a basic interface with fields to enter! | I cannot count the time wasted with your app. It is not helpful at all. I have tried every reference number to add my flights. I have tried to manually add and it has only added half my trip. This app is not helpful whatsoever. I sound not have had to work so hard to get my trips added. 
Makes me so frustrated | Don’t waste your time.  This used to be the best for my travels.  It has saved me from missing an overseas flight twice when the airline delay would make me miss the connecting flight to Germany. Since the last updates it is almost useless.  All the information that was so helpful is gone. So disappointing.  I would have paid to keep the previous version.  Deleted from my phone.  Looking for a replacement. | How could they screw this up so badly. This app now has been rendered useless. Can’t check on any detail about your flight, only simple things like flight numbers and time. THAT’S IT!!! You can’t even see your seat and frequent flyer info. And if you have other people on the same booking? Just forget about it, you can’t check on anything whatsoever. What a f up update. Pointless indeed. | This app is just a scam to withhold your flight confirmation number. I’ve learned my lesson. | It used to sync trip details with the calendar, not anymore | Used to be the best traveling app… not it’s just an overly complicated chatbot under a wanna-be AI disguise that simply does not work. | I used to love this app and would use it to morganite every single trip and introduced it to several friends. Then they upgraded and it became completely useless. I wonder if the developers don’t see that usage has dropped. It would be better for them to revert to the former version honestly. This new version is just awful.  I have moved on to other travel apps. | It is clearly on the airlines flight schedule for that day. I sent in request for fixing it and they said working on it. Still nothing done or working. I deleted it as we are leaving in three weeks. | This app was a very good travel app but it has lost it’s way. Recently had to load booking code (6alpha numeric) to get flight information. This was OK. BUT when it provided “check in” tap the app asked for the booking code. Why? No memory. App knows airlines but if you have already check-in the app can’t cross check with airlines.  I find it’s best to use the airline app and merely use this app (if at all) as a quick reference tool | I tried adding my trip manually several times and it kept giving me wrong flight info, and there is no way to update just one flight of a multi-flight itinerary, which is very frustrating.

I then emailed my itinerary as the other option suggested. When it came back it was still incorrect. 

Not worth my effort, deleted won’t try again. | Over the course of five days, I tried to add a trip using all three of the methods suggested.  I tried to manually add my trip at least 10 times all to no avail.  While this app used to be quite seamless, it now doesn’t seem to work and there doesn’t seem to be anyone you can talk to.  The “assistant” doesn’t connect you to a live person.  I’m ready to dump this app. | Something changed with this app and it’s totally nonfunctional, frozen screen, lost decades of travel data and absolutely zero customer service. | I used this app before, but suddenly it stopped working. Try to add trip and it send you to digital assistant and it goes nowhere | This was a good app a few years ago and extremely useful for a frequent traveler.  It would quickly identify your flights based on your ticket code and provide accurate, timely updates if flights were delayed etc.  Not now - since an “upgrade” (which apparently brought in “artificial intelligence”…) it rarely finds my flights from the reservation code and most times now you have to enter data manually, even when traveling on major airlines. The update facility has either disappeared or just doesn’t work anymore - I am sat in a plane which was announced to be delayed 6 hours ago and CheckMyTrip still hasn’t picked up on it.  It is now a complete waste of time.  I used to use this app all the time and rely on it for frequent travel.  Sadly it is going downhill rapidly… | I heard about this app on a trusted travel forum.  I really just doesn’t work.  Can find my flights using confirmation code, cant find my reservation using flight/date combination.

Not worth the time I spent.  Deleted the app on Day 1 | Used to be a useful website and app, now totally useless. Fails to import bookings and relies on a stupid chat agent for doing anything. Just chasing the AI bandwagon by adding a dumb chat bot for basic functionality. Deleting my account and the app. | I’ve been trying for 20 minutes to login for the first time. It keeps sending a code to my email and when I paste and add it into the app, it says it is an invalid code. Does anybody know if a better app to keep track of my travel itinerary? | We used to enter the booking reference but now it asks to enter each flight number and date … bit of a pain on a long trip with many flights and days | Doesn’t add trips either via forwarded email or manually.  No support.  Message app reply to request says basically that they are busy with other requests.  It’s worth the cost-i.e. nothing.  I use TripIt for all my travel —great app and well worth paying for. | It takes forever trying to search your trip if its on a different email. They have ruined the app. Nobody wants to sit and chat with a bot and enter all flight details manually. Not a great idea. Should go back to the way it was. | So extra for no reason, AI used in app is trash I hope to god I never have to use it again | If you can’t access your email that you originally set up the account with you can never sign back in because the app will only send a code to the defunct email account. Its as dunb as it sounds. | It needs a way to correct a flight without deleting the entire trip. Flight from ORD-YVR comes up as Omaha to Chicago | This stupid AI app ever. Doesn’t work whata junk | Used to be comprehensive and good. Now, pathetic | Do not waste your time with this app | It working very well, why u change and remove everything, what is the point now from your current up?!!! | The new version is awful, fully stripped down of features and providing as little information as possible. New trips are difficult to add, they disappear after adding, while deleted trips reappear. The assistant is unhelpful. Amadeus is well equipped to provide a good product and this is clearly an act of self destruction. | The app used to be good without the digital assistant. From the reviews that I’ve read, it looks like the developers aren’t looking to fix the app. Welp….time to switch apps. | It was sooo much easier to use without the bot. Even after adding details, can’t see trip. Scrap the bit feature | The latest version of this app it is a huge mistake. 
I’ve used CheckMyTrip for at least 20 years, even when it was just a webpage and not an app and with the new upgrade I cannot use it any longer. 
I used to store all my business and personal trip information using booking reference and my name info but now the only way to automatically import trip information with the booking reference is if you have personally booked the trip with your email address which it is not the normal practice in the business world. 
I hope that future versions will incorporate back the option to import bookings with the traveler info. | The update that requires use of a cumbersome chat bot for any inputs was a bad choice by the app developers.  It involves what should be in unnecessary inputs and is not initially intuitive. Please bring back the option to enter the old way.  Will not use this app, which I liked using before this change, until this requirement is removed and at worst the chat bit is an option. | We’ve used this app in the past and it was awesome. From the last time we’ve used it it has gone off a cliff horrible | This was a great APP prior to the latest update which crashed all of the data and no longer accepts confirmation numbers when you use a travel agent.  Sent in more than 5 requests to their customer support with no response.  I’ve deleted the APP and made note of the developer to avoid any future APPs created by them. | New version is quite useless and not user-friendly. Unable to add trip easily like the old versions. I will probably not use this anymore and have to rely on each airline’s mobile app instead for each trip. | This had been a fine app.  In March, however, they rolled out a purported “update” that simply does not work in any respect.  It’s not only useless, but it’s a negative — you undertake actions to add flights to the app, only to find that there’s nothing there.  I cannot understand why they ever rolled out the “update” or why, upon realizing that it was a complete bust, they didn’t go back to the old, functional app.  Unreal.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD IN ITS CURRENT STATE. | Was working great, a favorite app. Latest update requires a fresh log in and now my trip is lost and the Amadeus booking code is “unknown.” Not happy. | The recent update destroyed the app. I used to really like this app prior to the recent update and probably would’ve rated it as 4 or 5 stars for that version. However, since the most recent update the app is now a shell of its former self. It is clunky and hard to use, and 95% of the information it used to provide is gone. 
Don’t waste your time with this app so long as this is the version is in operation because it is useless in this form. | This app is practically worthless. Trying to add a trip in the app? Don’t bother. You won’t be able to unless you forward your confirmation email to the developer. This app is a horrible waste of time.

Update: I forwarded my trip confirmation email, received a reply email stating it was added, and it still doesn’t populate in the app. This app isn’t “practically” worthless… it’s COMPLETELY worthless. | Last update makes you go into a chat with a virtual admin assistance and you cannot see your trips anymore. Big mistake, everyone I know is going to another app. | Latest update seems to have broke the app. I keep getting dummy notifications and emails for random trips that are not mine. | Won’t load my SW flights.

They thrive on people panic booking and booking travel/events too soon with no cancellation policy. They will just take your money and run. No forgiveness or flexibility is given to rebook and even if they say they “will look into it” you will never hear from them again. I even offered to take “credits” to rebook the same travel and still nothing. | This app will show you results for hotels in Tokyo with what seems like very good prices but every hotel that I wanted to book, the app would say that there was 1 room left but then when you go to book, it would show no more rooms available. Repeat the search and the same hotels come up again. The app is a complete waste of time for booking hotels in Japan. Use booking.com or Agoda. Much better apps that only show you hotels that are available at time of search. | Easy to buy and quick to redeem. | We are very excited and happy | I’ve booked 3 different experiences around Thailand and the Philippines- amazing 🤩 | Klook is an excellent app to have while traveling in Asia. | great app | Never ever go with Klook. I had a really bad experience with KLOOK. I purchased ticket for Langkawi Cable Car. But the ticket could not be printed and I tried to reach Klook but they did not response. I had to purchase again from counter.  I asked for a refund and  they refused and did not say why this happened | I used Klook to by eSIM for my trip to China. I set delivery date for my departure date and I still have not received the voucher. I am testing to reach customer support, but they do not respond promptly. I had to wait for 1 hr to get a response. When the support stated talking to me I see the notifications but I do not see their messages in the support chat. Very broken app. They say I will be able to get my voucher in the app, but I do m not see anything. I feel I am being scammed. Very unhappy. | This app is a great way to obtain tickets to a wide range of events, trips, and a lot more! | This app work flawless and helpful. | I was looking to book the Shinkansen reservation and came across this app. It was easy to find which day, what time and where the stations are to take the train. I will recommend everyone to use this to book their next Shinkansen reservation, | Stay away from this Klook App! Purchased a private car transfer from Kansai Airport in Osaka and we waited over a hour with no driver anywhere around to pick us up but there were many others around with cards shown for other riders. Klook support is only by chat unlike others where you can call a US Number and after wasting lots of time in chat they say the driver doesn’t answer his phone. We eventually had to catch a taxi for a higher price and later received a email from Klook saying that the driver said he was there waiting for us which was a total scam. They wouldn’t issue a immediate refund so we were forced to contact our credit card company and submit a refund claim. Stay away from Klook like the plague! | We used Klook extensively for booking experiences and hotels for our trip to Taiwan. Everything went smoothly and the prices were good too. | I was hesitant at first but I've booked multiple visits so far and everything ran smooth and at a great price too! I plan to use Klook more for my next trip! | Been using this app for years without any problems.will continue to use it for all my Japan trips and will continue to recommend to others | I don’t understand how a website does not offer any kind of support or help for its users or customers!! Haven’t heard of AI, I guess!! They are more interested in just taking your money, then you’re damned!!! My bad for listening to other raving reviews that are now totally useless!!! It would help to have a feminist touch…😱😱 | We’ve used Klook for 2 different locations so far. It has been so easy to book tickets and get the vouchers sent directly to us. We will continue to use Klook as much as possible for every adventure we go on! | Horrible service and no customer assistance with this app, they just leave you out to dry as soon as you pay!! | HORRIBLE. They let me book and experience for 2 hours away from where i stay on Wednesday for a Sunday, confirmed the booking, and send me my confirmation number. So I book travel for the day, and make arrangements. Then Saturday night they cancelled via email to say it’s overbooked. AVOID AT ALL COSTS | This app is worse than useless. I booked a tour, paid money, then found out 4 days later there was no availability. And since I was counting on this “booking” all the companies have since sold out as well.

Now get to wait for my money to be returned, for a booking that never existed in the fist place. And of course Klook kept their cut “Klook upgrades cannot be refunded”. So they just took $10 from me on top of everything else. 

There are better apps that do the same thing, but come through. Don’t use | I was having problems purchasing tickets to Disneyland website and the app with issue with my debit card and when my cousin send me this app, it was so quick and fast. Now I don’t have to stress about it anymore. Well done Klook!!! | I was worried I was not able to use my ticket voucher for the next day, but help center syamimi was able to help me and informed me that I can use the voucher until May 18, 2024. Great job on the customer service! | To whom it may concern.

On the klook app I have noticed a few times with several different airlines when you add the flight number for example TG404 and my flight is tomorrow it changes the date of my flight airport transportation from March 26 to the flight today on March 25. They use the same flight numbers both days. It would be nice if the date not change.
Thank you. I lost money because of this. | First time user of the app.  I made a mistake traveling to Tokyo making reservations.  No help what so ever.  My transaction is still pending after i noticed the error on my part and contacted them within 15 mins of waiting in a que.  I thought this app would be great to use.  After i use the tickets i previously purchased it will get deleted. To many other apps that have better customer service. | I book basically everything for our trips on Klook. We get to discover new adventures that we may have not have even learned about without it. It saves time on queues too. Thank you Klook | Easy to use and the savings are significant! Refunds are painless and the app gives great suggestions on fun things to do! | from end-to-end this service is awful. terrible interface, completely unclear directions, complete lack of warnings like not being able to book same-day tickets, and then totally unhelpful customer service. thanks for wasting several hours of my life trying to use this ridiculous app and service | Easy to access essential promotion deal in the visited area and great customer service! Highly recommend people use their service especially traveling Asia | KLOOK is the way to go if you want to organize your trip in advance. It is easy to book and no hussle since you bought your tickets in n advance! Thanks , KLOOK! | Site is user friendly for an old dog like me 🐶 | I find the app extremely easy to use | Great service. | Although this app has a lot of good deals they also allow shady businesses apart of their app. We booked a hotel room stay for one night and on my statement it said I check in March 3rd and check out March 4th. We get to the hotel and the front desk tells us we only have the room for 2 hours and wants to upcharge us but on my statement it clearly says that I am booked for march 3rd check in and check out March 4th. The receptionist leaves to the back and never comes back out so we can’t even talk to anyone. We wait over 2 hours to speak to someone while also trying to get ahold of Klook only for them to tell us they can’t refund us because it’s the day of and my mistake.. What do you mean ??? We wasted 2 hours waiting to speak to the receptionist at the hotel and used ZERO of their services and they continue to allow business like this on their app. Be CAREFUL. | Lies and false information from Klook and then no refund. | As expected I sent them the whole story of what’s happened in the link they pretended to provide (like they care). Nope! over a week after, nothing happens, not even an acknowledge or pretend like they are working on the case. Truly, a sad customer support! Previous: This was my first time using Klook, as they seem popular in Asia. I booked a car rental, but in the confirmation email, it stated that refunds were not available on the day of the rental. I attempted to cancel my reservation one day prior, but Klook refused to issue a refund and instead suggested to a full charge. Unfortunately, there was no clear explanation about refund policies or fees prior to the rental date. Despite multiple attempts to contact their call center, I was never given a satisfactory answer about the language used in the confirmation email or why a refund was not possible, the reps were just simply “no refund, bye” and didn’t bother to read my further questions. | I just used klook to schedule airport pickup in Hanoi, VN.  The site asked me for my flight info but didn’t realize it set the date for Feb 27 default (that’s tomorrow).  I needed the pickup for March 9th.  I realized the mistake and engaged them immediately.  They said there’s nothing they can do to cancel.  There is a 24 hour before pickup free cancellation but due to Vietnam being 12 hours ahead of the US, I was already within that 24 hour before I ever booked because of the auto date they set.  

This is a terrible way to do business. And I will not be using them again. | Very easy to navigate and all the tours we had are perfect. | Very easy to navigate thru the app. A one stop for all your train rides and experiences to purchase tickets and have all your information in one place. | I couldn’t find the booking confirmation on my email. I asked for help from Klook live chat. Muhammad A found my booking information and resent it to me. I still couldn’t locate it on the inbox. He sent me a pdf attachment with the live chat so that I could download it. He is one of the best costumer specialist I have luckily had! Thank you Muhammad! | 台灣人是不習慣當面給小費的。有些導遊也不自在提小費，可以學Uber,在review 裏或付款裏加要不要給小費。我以前買伴手禮要送導遊，他都不收的。 | Nice | This software has engaged in false marketing and fraud in Chinese region.

Had a problem with my train ticket voucher voucher. Was not able to use it! Will dispute with my Visa card! | Can’t do without Klook when traveling abroad. | 我喜欢在klook 上寻找旅行项目，价格比较合理 | Best travel APP you can find | Customer support was very courteous and helpful. Sindhu N. assisted me with a refund when I mistakenly booked the wrong month. | I wasn’t able to check out using 3 of the 4 payment methods I tried.

Car was clean and driver was very nice and made sure the temperature in car was good for us. Helped loading and unloading luggage. | Best driver ever! Her driving was safe and conversation pleasant. | Very good driver | This feedback is for Lyft’s development team, and probably not for users. I tried to submit this issue via the ‘support’ and ‘contact us’ sections of both the app and the website, but neither would let me submit app feedback. They both funneled me only into specific feedback categories for ride/driver feedback, and then dead-ended me there, even when I clicked “not helpful/unresolved.”

So an inability to even submit feedback is a bonus issue. 

The actual issue that prompted this was the app’s inability to add more than one extra stop. 

I needed to be picked up at my home, driven to a location where I would pick up a key, taken to another location where I would pick up a second key, and then taken home. Each stop was maybe a minute, just grabbing a key. 

Because the app wouldn’t allow myself or the driver to extend the trip, my driver sped off as soon as he dropped me. It’s not his fault, as he of course was pinged by his next ride. So I hailed another Lyft. 

My 2nd Lyft picked me up at my 2nd stop. The driver was taking me home when I realized I needed to loop back to the 2nd location because I had forgotten something with the whole key juggling mess. This would have been simple if the driver or myself were able to edit the ride, but since he weren’t, he had to simply end the ride back at my 2nd location and each of us confirmed our safety when the app noticed the ride didn’t go as plotted. He of course sped away to catch his next ride, unable to add an option to simply wait for me. (Again, not his fault, but rather the app’s shortcoming.) 

So once I had picked up the last item of my errand at the 2nd location, I then had to summon a 3rd Lyft. The whole mess took much more time and cost much more than necessary. 

I used to drive for Uber years ago. Changing destinations or adding stops was not difficult. This was such an annoying experience that I’m back to considering Uber as a regular option. | We have absolutely enjoyed our drivers and the prompt attendance.  
We were told to take a Taxi from Airport,  I suggest don’t listen to them take a lyft. | The driver was friendly and very safe driver. Thank you! | He was so sweet and kind ❤️ | Very friendly | The app did not let me choose the pick up area desired and it also gave the driver bad directions for pick up. | It’s shocking honestly- regardless of the time of day, can never get a ride. | ME ESTAN COBRANDO POR UNA CARRERA QUE JAMÁS TOME!! ME CARGARON 17 DOLARES EXTRAS Y NO ENTIENDO COMO SU APLICACIÓN NO TIENE NINGUN AREA DE RECLAMO, SOLO MANDAN OPCIONES TONTAS QUE NO SIRVEN PARA NADA, SON LA PEOR APLICACIÓN DE TAXI NO PIENSO SEGUIR USANDO SU SERVICIO | What an experience!! It is my first time taking Lyft since I drive my car always. But the driver was a wonderful person and very friendly. | For 10 years I had a 5 star rating. A driver refuses to take a toll road and leaves me on the side of the road in the rain on my way to an event. The problem is that Lyft refused to take care of me in this situation or even cover the ride I had to rebook at a higher price due to the rain and running late for the event. In their words Lyft doesn’t “monetize on customer safety”. So in this regard Lyft won’t monetize me as a customer any more. | Consistently drivers will accept a ride request and then cancel after you have waited for 10+ minutes. Super unreliable, and when you do get a ride the car typically wreaks of air freshener to mask cigarette smells. Usually my last option when i need a ride. | Too many cancellations by drivers being unprofessional to look at address and only go by location with Lyft sends them and is not always accurate... then they do not respond to text or call in order to get paid for nothing and to charge us for No Service.... too many unprofessional drivers and Lyft is loosing credibility... not good feedback either. ;-( I would also highly recommend drivers to learn English | “I had a fantastic experience with my Lyft driver! They were punctual, friendly, and drove safely. The car was clean and comfortable, and they even offered some great conversation during the ride. Overall, a top-notch experience. Would definitely ride with them again!” | Flawless | Well pleased! | What can I say? Lyft is the big Mac of transportation!! | Went from 9.99 to 25 in a matter of an hour. Highway robbery. | The ride info screen shows ads. 

I don’t pay to see ads, I pay for a ride. I need *ride details* in the app, not ads. | I love it I love it ! | Thank you my driver was very nice person good driving make my morning | I use Lyft about 4 times/year. They have earned my trust to get me to my destination on time even when I only give them 15-30 min to pick me up. Thank you, Lyft drivers! | There’s no way to contact customer service so I’m leaving it here I’m so frustrated with Lyft. Every time I take a ride I’m charged for the ride and still hit with a temporary hold on my account. It is taking a while for the money to come back so now I have limited funds to get to work due to this issue. And I don’t know what to do now I have 4 temporary holds now of unaccounted money. | Siempre que necesito llegar a un sitio rápido y a un buen costo los contrato | Their Maps is ridiculous. Either the programming personal are idiots but the app  will purposely make the driver go longer because they charge you more in your cost. | My Drivers name was Joe. He was an amazing person. Kept Me in the loop and great conversation. Thanks Joe for the smooth ride in. | thank you for a comfortable and safe trip | Friendly and punctual. Thanks. | I love this app drivers are the best cheap rides always on time | Lyft is great for when I’m too drive to drunk! | Cool driver clean car and smelled good inside friendly and respectful went above and beyond with service… keep this driver on the team | When I do ride Lyft they’re always convenient  and on time. | She was a a very safe and friendly driver. Took a nice route back to our hotel and she was the first driver to enter the hotel at the right side. Very thankful for her driving | Good service and good for getting to places you need to or want to go. | She was warm and kind to us. Extremely polite and thoughtful person! | Everything was perfect! | I’m a convert. Uber was $126 to hotel from DC airport- Lyft was $76.   First time Lyft rider- it was so much better than Uber.   I will always price compare from now on- plus my driver -Asif was the absolute best! Had water, iced coffee, calm environment. Perfect. | I LOVEEEEEEEE LYFT!!!!! | Lyft has great prices that are very affordable unlike Uber that has there prices jacked up so high but the rides are good I booked my best friend ride and she loved it as well | You hired someone who was unprofessional and rather keep someone belongings then return them. | Wilga was my driver and he was great! His car was spotless inside and out, he was very nice, and he waited patiently while I had to stop at my hotel before heading to the airport. I had pulled up both LYFT (my preference by far) and UBER and the LYFT was more than $6 cheaper. Win-win, thank you! | I’ve used Uber for Years… today things went sideways with the Uber App. I was frustrated & just downloaded the Lyft App. What a great decision! Effortless & Great Driver!  I know many drivers work both apps, but I’m grateful I tried Lyft!! | I couldn’t get ahold of my husband to come get me from work. Lyft was easy to download, it’s inexpensive & arrived quickly. | Thanks u young lady | Ms. Tia is a 5 star driver. She was very friendly and made my ride relaxed. | Not right. Bumped over 50% from the price promised at pick up. Back to Uber. | I typically only use Lyft when my car is being serviced, if I’m going out drinking or it’s an unfamiliar place I don’t want to drive. Lyft never fails to let me down, such a convenience and I  feel comfortable and safe but most importantly I feel like I’m getting to my destination in one route. | It was a long trip home & my driver was wonderful the entire way.

I’ve had it, I’m done with this app!!!! I def don’t wanna get my money took from my account again from their buddies audiobooks!!! I bet this all won’t even be around in another year! Bye audiobook thieves and Nikes just as bad for letting them do it!!! You can find this post everywhere with screenshots | It used to have multiple options for redeeming the gift cards, and they are available all the time. Now it only has the $5 gift cards, which means you need to accumulate a lot of miles, I’m fine with it, the problem is that these $5 gift cards are never available, it tells you “the card will be available in 2/5 hours “, but it doesn’t, no one will be checking this app all the time to see if the gift cards are available.

Edit on 04/22/2024:
Now more gift cards are available, but they just stopped adding miles you earned. I drove to San Diego and earned zero miles, I guess they just don’t want to give out gift cards. | This app somehow became the #1 storage space consumer on my iPhone, taking up OVER 45 GIGS of space. There is ZERO need for this that I can see and I could not find a way to clear a cache or something similar that would reduce its memory usage. As others have said, the benefits we now get/have available in the app are not worth this kind of usage. I am deleting Miles, as I have other apps that give me far more benefit/return vs my time spent. | The rewards are too high now, the app freezes a lot, and now you need to claim every trip, unless you choose to pay for a premium membership, which costs more than you’d make. Clown shoes app. | It won’t let me sign in it says “number of attempts exceeded please try again later” and it has said that for months | This app takes up a tremendous amount of resources. I understand apps using some resources, but this app was taking up so much that it was preventing most of my other apps from working properly. It was to the point where I contacted Apple because I thought it was my phone. It was not the phone. It was this app. I saw how much it was using and I deleted it, and immediately after I removed it, my phone and all my apps worked just fine. There’s no reason why an app like this really needs to take up nearly 40 gigs of space. I was at 207 GB before deleting it, and now that it’s gone, I have 168 GB used. So sorry to say, but the five bucks a month I may get from accumulated miles that I have to check in myself is not worth a $700 phone improperly working. Best of luck with your app, but I will not be using it anymore. | its so useless and you have to get so many miles to do anything. I don’t know why i downloaded the app and kept it for as long as i did. | At the beginning of getting this app, I was still suspicious of it so when it asked for my health app connection I said no. Now seeing that it works i want to connect them together, so i downloaded the app. I don’t know what to do now because I’m not sure if they connected? | The app keeps freezing, and getting stuck loading, it doesn’t matter where I am at. The app is definitely a resource hog, I have tried it on multiple devices, all with the same results. | The app is not well optimized. Often crashes and does not work well on a iPhone 14 Pro Max. For selling your location data, this app avoids giving payouts and the countdown to available timer just keeps resetting. | I’m just gonna drop to one now since I received an email from the CEO stating they listened to us and I don’t see any changes and it’s still pay to win. | This app just simply is not worth the trouble I’ve had it for a long while and none of the stuff u can “buy” (if you can say that) is worth it and on top of that they are constantly taking all my saved up miles and it’s just not worth it | I put my location services on & yet I’m not earning miles; this app only works when it wants to or the updates don’t work!!!
 My Husband & I just went to Indy on Monday, April 8th for the solar eclipse & no miles…I can only earn by doing the trivia questions!! | Hi this is a great app maybe add more charity’s weekly for people who want to donate to the causes.  I would like to see once in a while a different charity. Plus the three that you have. 

Thank you. | No it doesn’t , the app is full of ads and basically tells you you’re not going to earn anything unless you sign up for monthly plan of $50 💀 | It wont let me put in my phone number, idk if im doing it right or not but pls tell me the way to do it | My friend referred me to this app through a text message link that claimed to give each of us 4,000 miles I used the referral code and it gave me 200 and preceded to give my friend none. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS ITS A LIAR IT ONLY LIES ITS FAKE FAKE FAKE DONT DOWNLOAD ⚠️ | It’s hard to enough to earn enough miles for just redeeming a $1 Amazon gift card…
& I have received an email saying because I haven’t get on the app for the past 2 months, they took 20,000 miles off as “maintenance fee”, super ridiculous, don’t waste your time on this app. | I mean it works fine but it used background activity a lot, i was on a road trip and couldn’t figure out why i was losing so much battery even while i wasnt on it by the minute, turned out it was this app. | I earn miles but i really don’t know how to cash out i specially wanna cash out with Apple Cash. I tried looking for help in the app but  it doesn’t show what im looking for. | These aren’t specialty rewards.. these companies are they give you these awards… can you just have to look for them what a crock. I only want money for my data and information from now on, and it will not be cheap. | I was tryna cash it out to cash app but I don’t know how to so it was hard to use the app | Years ago the app was good. I used to use it often because you didn’t have to pay a subscription to get all of your miles. I travel for a living and it’s crazy to think I get awarded 20 miles for a 120 mile drive, and for a 7 mile drive I get 8 miles. This app is just trying to get your money at this point. They stopped caring about the users experience and instead went for the money grabbing route and it’s sad to see. They’re excuse is that you can purchase their subscription in order to get all of your benefits, but why do I have to now when I didn’t have to before. Stupid change and terrible app, only reason I’m still on here is just to spend the last of my miles. Also you can only purchase on gift card a month and the raffles are fake. Update: the response you have given has only made me not want your app more. What made your app bad was the fact you made it to where you have to have a subscription in order for the app to be worth it. The whole point of the app is to earn not spend. You have changed that whole premise and that’s your response to every single persons post is “miles+”. It didn’t used to exist and should’ve never exist. Same thing as buying miles. At this point you have turned your app into a pay to win Minecraft server. | Overall it’s a good app but I’m super confused how to cash out because it doesn’t say anything on cashing out, I want to cash out my miles into my Apple Pay or cash app account? | I was told I would get actual money from this that I could put on my cash app for example from TikTok ADs. This is NOTA true. All you really get it pretty much a few weeks of a free trial of something but it so hard to get them just for that. You get one mile for every mile you travel but to get almost anything you need THOUSANDS. This is not worth it and you do NOT get like $60 a week like the ads say. Don’t download. | On one trip I drive 136 miles but only earn 34 miles, and on another trip I drive 34 miles and earn 36 miles???? Make it make sense!! | wont even let me sign up keeps saying “there’s a problem on our end” | The app used to be ok when it auto tracked your miles for you. Now they want to charge $50 annually for that. And they now also charge a “maintenance fee” by wiping out all your miles if you don’t log in for two months. I lost 60,000+ miles from my account from this, even though no notice was given of the change and no warning the miles would be taken away. Simply not worth it. | This app used to b much better before it started charging to get the full benefits. I usually always just rack miles up til I have enuf to enter in a raffle or 2. (With at least 250-300 entries) and  I've entered probably bout 300 or more an only one 1. I'll probably delete soon if I keep not winning a raffle after so many I have other apps like this anyway. | I just downloaded this app from an and I was on TikTok (people saying they were either sceptical or earning 100’s of dollars. ) seeing this app now, it’s just not worth it at all. Don’t waste your time unless you want a 3 dollar Amazon gift card for driving 7000 miles. NOT WORTH IT!!!! ☹️ | This app used to be good. And then the rewards got less, and less….. and less. And now it costs double your points to even get a reward. Was a good app. Not worth it anymore. | It’s the number one battery drain, even when tracking is turned off. It used 20% of my battery usage when turned off. Even more than Google maps navigation. 

It’s payout requires at least 10k miles for $5. That’s almost a year of tracking for that. 

It used to just automatically give you the miles which is not horrible. But now with the update you need to go to the app and claim each trip so the miles are recorded. 

And also, now when you redeem for gift cards, its not straight forward, there’s one per hour, so you’re competing against others. You can redeem only 20k miles per month, that’s the limit. | I enjoy useing it getting miles for every trip I take I cash out few times with it getting gift cards that’s pretty much my miles points go to | This app used to be easy to navigate and earn miles.  I was always a Diamond user throughout the month.  Now it’s more difficult, limiting and just not as rewarding.  I get the ads but having to manually claim miles and only being able to claim a portion unless I upgrade is frustrating.  I’ll keep for now, but not in my daily app rotation as it used to be.  Fingers crossed they’ll roll back some changes and make the users happy… | You have made it much harder to earn miles thru surveys, the points are much lower.  You keep changing the rules.  I paid to upgrade and now considering trashing the app.  You are probably a communist funded organization. | I’m getting tired of the teir requirements changing. I feel like they’ve changed a lot here lately. Honestly, I don’t drive enough to make much off this app most of the time so realistically for me to stay diamond tier this month I’m going to have to travel out of town a lot or just give it up. I work two jobs with a roughly 13 mile commute from home to job #1, 5 miles to job #2 and then another 13 miles home and that’s 6 days out of the week. I’m probably just going to stay on the app long enough to spend the rest of my points and then delete it. **a miles+ member** | Love the daily trivia. I get most of the answers correctly. Doing the surveys everyday is worth spending a few minutes. | It’s not worth it. It use to be better before they changed it. It’s very difficult to accumulate points. In addition, it’s even more difficult to win prizes. | Didn’t use it for several months as they now charge a yearly membership fee.

I logged back in, and 51,738 miles were removed. Now at zero balance. | After the latest update where you have to earn Miles to keep Diamond instead of spending them the app is a whole money grab. Gotta pay for auto mile claims instead of it being originally automatic. Unless you doing Uber or something this app isn’t worth it anymore. I’ve never wrote a review on anything but for this I had to. 👋🏾 miles | I’ve been on this app for years.At first it was wonderful. They added your miles, all could get gift cards and you could get really good deals. (I did have an incident they rectified when I won a bid and they actually gave my code to someone else…I should have known it was going downhill then) Now this app is trash. If you don’t choose to pay for their premium membership you’re treated like a 2nd class citizen. You have to manually add your miles or just lose them. You never have enough miles for gift cards and the offers are garbage. It’s just boring and terrible. Don’t waste your time and money on this app it’s not worth it. Uninstalling today !!!! | Great app fr | The average driver in my area drives 10,000 miles a year.  A generic fast food $5 gift card is 10,000 miles.  So if every mile I drove was counted, I could redeem one gift card a year.  But every trip isn’t counted.  Only 5 are counted.  Sure you can boost a trip a day and say what you are doing or whatever for extra miles but my God.  You make it difficult to want to use the app.

20K for a $5 amazon or PayPal card.  2 years of driving.  Completely asinine. | I have had this app for a while and it has just gone from ok to plain horrible. Was able to redeem for a couple of gift cards but they were already used. Support is a non existent . Now they want you to pay for a subscription which is the biggest joke of all time. You need 20k miles for a $5 Amazon gift card. LOL. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this garbage app. | I had 400k+ miles and as part of maintenance fees all of them were removed. 

Not fair. | I recently updated my phone to the IOS17 which is when my phone started to overheat and the battery would drain rapidly fast. At the time I didn’t know the issue, and no one else did either so I had to get a new phone. The new phone did the same thing. It turns out it was this app causing the issues. It was running constantly in the background and it didn’t even track my miles. After deleting the app, my phone is operating smoothly again. | You supply them all sorts of information and they provide you with rewards that are next to impossible to achieve and redeem. | I’ve had this app for almost 2 years and for some reason I can’t claim any of the miles I earned from my trips I can only earn from surveys and I can’t even spend them because it keeps saying there’s and error on there end not happy at all. As I am a student with little income and depending on my trips and earned gift cards to get presents for the holidays I am beyond upset and disappointed with so many miles that feels like useless miles since the app won’t work right. | I’ve had the app for a while, and when I first started, they had different denominations on gift cards that you could choose from and tracked your miles better. Now it doesn’t track them as accurately and they made it harder for you to actually redeem. I wish it would go back.",4.6589,60888,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/09/17/30/091730f7-c851-fd98-7001-bc7d5250d294/360199ba-4dec-4792-8a55-6ffc600f46fc_5.5_screen_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/fb/36/92/fb36924c-70b9-f903-0fcf-21241d79dd64/b786627c-d9ed-464b-95a7-b950bea52c3d_5.5_screen_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/5a/9e/f0/5a9ef03d-ce67-ed78-ebe8-a1f0ebbe4aa0/33d18eed-b2aa-491d-835c-6f7281ba3345_5.5_screen_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/7d/12/f7/7d12f7f4-5aa6-c612-ba1b-4eb5a5326c38/9ec8b31e-b835-411d-8ed2-870389912340_5.5_screen_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/2e/4c/18/2e4c185c-de27-bfc3-1c6e-be67991143e8/afb97480-f6e9-4a7f-a567-19e0b199d0a8_5.5_screen_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/71/8e/38/718e386c-8a08-392e-e9dd-a91233cfcbea/a48937a2-15e5-424e-85d3-1e340a81f5ce_5.5_screen_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/d0/bb/99/d0bb9934-0007-e077-c905-565fae47b2df/e9bed127-79df-4729-b839-16b9c5e3d805_5.5_screen_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/bd/25/75/bd257521-28f0-9971-3b58-020e9ddbe315/ae30a762-9d9b-434a-b744-53716ced1065_5.5_screen_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/a8/31/b6/a831b64b-1f60-587b-f05d-bc837017d49f/ddfcaf78-c86e-4183-80e4-619fe20019be_5.5_screen_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/fb/ec/85/fbec850b-b5f5-dc66-18d9-a6be970794bf/92b26e24-9b58-45f6-b983-23a3c87b9c3d_5.5_screen_10A.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I live in Orlando and this past Saturday flew out to Dallas. When I arrived at MCO which I remind everyone is the home airport to Disney and one of the busiest airports there is, I arrived at the Clear lane to a huge line. The person at the entry said they had 1 frikin person working the lane and we were better off going directly through TSA. This has happened more than once. Clear has become worthless, and has nothing to do with Next Gen setups when they are struggling to get people in to work at these lanes during the busiest periods, along with their recent raise in rates, it's a sign of a company struggling badly. | Literally the worst app ever. Tried it multiple times for linkedIn verification. It doesn’t work at all | Gotta say clear agent and customer service aren’t that helpful but I just decided to cancel and was able to get  what I was hoping for | The service was great when it started but it’s consistently slower than pre-check. What a waste of time and money. | This app is terrible! It couldn’t read a foreign passport, couldn’t verify my identity. Even when I tried to add a California State ID. When I tried to delete the account and start afresh without the foreign passport (as this seems to be the issue), it said it couldn’t verify my identity and therefore would not delete the account. | I got a new drivers license and the app won’t let me update my ID. Now they require an ID check every time I use Clear at the airport. It’s not just me. My wife has the same problem with the app in her account. | They use your hairstyle to identify and verify your account, not safe to use | I used to love Clear. Since up
5 years ago I have been a subscriber and I used to use it everywhere it was available when I travelled.

Now, I go through TSA Pre instead of Clear almost every trip the past year. The reasons are several. 1. At LAX it’s often now faster to just go through TSA Pre. 2. At least the past half dozen times I tried to use here there is this new ID update verification. And every time it has failed, with the agent at security fussing around trying to fix it, and can never fix it, which has added 10 minutes of delay while I repeatedly explain that nobody at Clear has ever been able to fix it. It’s some profile name vs name on ID mismatch. Fixing it in profile has never fixed it and like I said the fussing around by agents in person has been useless. The last time I tried I got so frustrated I turned around walked back and went through TSA Pre. So I just gave up even trying to use Clear anymore. And since the membership fees have gone up, I won’t renew again. Somehow Clear has really dropped the ball when they had a really great thing going. | They are really terrible now. Oversubscribed. Longer & slower lines than tsa pre ant many airports. | This app doesn’t work at all! No matter how many selfies you take or how many times you upload your ID it never takes the picture properly no matter where you are or how the lighting is. It just fails constantly. Unlike one of their competitors, they offer no video call to have a live person manually verify anything. They rely exclusively on technology that just never anything but fails. | Such a waste of time. Repeatedly trying to add my ID. Tried multiple lighting, never takes. Went in for help chat. When I get bar to type my response or question, doesn’t allow my response to populate up in chat! On top, many airports have extremely rude checkin staff | Adding your id to this app is one of the most hideous experiences that you will ever have. One star just because they’ve failed to fix that one feature that is incredibly easy to fix. | After paying for the service and signing up, I couldn’t actually verify any of my physical documents in the app. This led to issues at the gate, and the personnel could not sufficiently assist in this regard. Very disappointing experience! | I am not sure why they have an app.. It does not tell you to update your profile… You have to do that at the Airport and if you do not update your profile at that time.. you can not use the Clear service you paid for and ask to get out of the line and go to regular TSA.  So even if you paid for this service do not count on that you will be able to use it… If you ask to call customer support you can not as the number they lost always says they are closed and the online Chat (Kayle) has no way to help you use something you paid for while you are at the airport | This used to be great but now it takes longer than regular security. The NextGen+ upgrade doesn’t work and their staff are incredibly rude. Save your money, and if you are in a hurry just get TSA pre-check. | Agent at LAX airport never explained or introduced himself. Just said he will help me get to the front of the line and took me to the Clear machine. Said he will get it for free then started asking to input info. By this point, too late for me to back out because I initially thought he would get me to the front of the line out of good grace. Ended up spending longer signing up than waiting at security itself. He should have explained everything before hand instead of using pressure in the scheme of “helping cut line” . Had to get the app and cancel membership because it isn’t free. | Lady at the airport said we can cancel after a week of trial . It was supposed to be a free week but we got charged $288 dollars . And now I had to cancel my credit card and get a new one . IF YOU Don’t TRAVEL A-LOT DO NOT GET THIS ! | This will trick you in enrolling for free and notoriously will lead you to think that once you cancel your membership, thats it! Wrong! They will auto renew your membership and charge you card! | Helped us greatly! Last week we were running late for our plane to LA. We would not have made it if we had to stand in that long security line! I asked about the TSA PRE CHECK, the agent helped us sign up and be on our way around the line, straight to the front! Definitely felt like VIP, I recommend to anyone that travels a lot! | This useless app just can’t verify my selfie for LinkedIn verification. | International airports still don’t work even after they said they were added (and should have been years ago). Try SYD and others. Nothing.

Updated: works now after comment from dev they were rolling it out. Advise don’t put it in release notes if it’s not available. | The vast majority of reviewers left a one star rating; how does that add up to 4.7?? | Clear lines longer than TSA Pre.  Check in process waste even more time. | Nowhere does it say in the same up you can’t use this if you’re not a US citizen. Instead they wait till you queue up in the airport, give them your fingerprints and then they tell. Resulting in having to queue again. 
Cancelling is also extremely difficult as they keep telling my password is wrong and it’s not. 
Worst service and app!! | Only works if you travel within the United States, I have a flight to ST. Croix United States Virgin Islands it should work but doesn’t. Time to delete this app. | The service is awful….you need to wait eternity to get some response…it seams like they watching interesting movie while chatting with you…and they don’t care what problem you was faced… enough of this nonsense from me. Deleting. | It used to be a “skip the line” service but it’s not any more.  Every time I try to use it, it’s broken.  The agents tell me how it’s a “software update” and you have to reregister. Every single time I have used clear on the last 3 years, clear SLOWED me down at the airport. Awful awful awful.  Save your money and do not get clear. | Tried it about five times in the last 2 months and I think I think it would have been faster off going through the regular PreTSA at DCA. Also, they always seem to have technical issues. Will definitely not renew. | Why would I pay more to get screwed at the airport and have regular security passengers get checked in way before I did. This is a rip off - clear is essentially regular security at this point and is false advertising. I would give this app 0 stars if I could. Absolutely useless and a waste of time that will actually cost you more time than saving time. | After having problems with my ID scaling into the app, I contacted customer service via chat (as instructed). The wait time was negligible but when the chat started it took them 20 minutes to look at my account before I could even tell them my problem. I’ve had the account for a week there’s not that much to review. I was instructed to cancel my membership and start again. I inquired about my 3 months of clear plus that I was supposed to receive free and was instructed to use the promo code again. I pointed out that it wouldn’t work because I had already used it. After 15 minutes I was told to cancel my membership, pay for it and then he would give me 3 months free. I am not paying for it before I  try it and determine it it’s worth the $200.  After waiting for 10 minutes for a response I simply clicked out thinking I would let the person at the airport assist me. When I open the app today, I was surprised to see my account canceled. I can’t reuse the promo code either. What a waste of my time and energy. | There’s no reconciliation system or viable customer support for data errors. They collect the data and that’s it! No service provided. Simply horrible. | It is very strange for my that this service doesn’t work with prepaid phone plans I cannot varify my identity on LinkedIn because I have mint mobile prepaid plan. Their support advice me to change my phone number or carrier. It is very strange. So each client with prepaid plan cannot use their service It is ridiculous | This app really doesn’t do much and doesn’t really even need to be used to get on a flight so why do they need to update it literally twice a week?  Once a month is even more than enough. Huge battery life drain downloading and installing this with auto update every few days. | I have attempted over 50 times to take a picture of my ID and passport and it keeps saying it won’t read. I have followed all of the instructions and it keeps saying it won’t read. | Poor customer service. App not fully functioning. | More than half of the airports I try to use Clear on don’t even have Clear so why are you selling it like every airport does this is kind of been a waste of my money. Where do I find the airports that actually use clear? | The experience was weird and complicated and difficult, I repeated the registration process again at the airport, I can't believe that a company and app made the experience of using technology so complicated, it was really awful, I canceled the membership, it was very expensive. | The app is good to contain all my travel ID information and to keep my membership information someplace.  The other features like flight tracking is extremely buggy and doesn’t work correctly.  When I tried to get support, either it was an AI just as buggy or an illiterate person.  Either way, I question if my information is safe or could it be compromised. | In the last year of 40 flights clear has failed to once be easier or faster than precheck, save your money | I landed in Detroit airport and the Clear line was longer (a lot longer) then the regular TSA Pre-Check line.  This has happened quite a bit lately, so just keep that in mind when go to the airport and in your justification for purchasing clear. | Like the title says, the app seems to work okay, but for no reason should anyone waste money on a Clear membership, as you end up paying more just to wait longer.  The concept is great, but Clear has failed to implement the process properly and provide any real value.  End result: DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON CLEAR. | Flying with Clear helps my trips to be easier and less stress!  Scanning my eyes or fingers are easy and reduces my wait time in in the Security Lines! Clear Team are always upbeat and personable as well as courteous!

Money well spent! | Can’t scan my id, image is out of focus. I’d imagine this is a problem with the macro lens and the app not supporting the camera api. Will revise review when it works. | App does not work, I can’t log in | I went to website to set up my account but the app won’t allow me to enter any of my information. | Subpar dev and qa efforts go to this app. They cant even get the basics right | Had a temporary license and tried to use my military ID for registration which they don’t take?! Wasted 30min before my flight just to get in the back of the line. I don’t understand why people pay for this service. | When you need a helpful app and they say I have one for you. This app is not it. Waste of time and money on development… please start over,  from scratch… | Continued to fail to identify me and support told me that you cannot verify your identity unless your name is on your phone company… so a wife cannot verify her identity if her phone plan is under her husbands name… | I was trying to use this to quickly go through the TSA line.  It took me the entire time of waiting in line for TSA for it to finally accept my passport, don’t waste your time.",4.72039,450858,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/cb/59/f6/cb59f603-b01b-63a5-9507-063380741586/2fba2b38-4a5f-42a5-b317-a132716df1ec_H2G_Feature_-_iOS_-_5.5_inch.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/66/2b/d4/662bd404-cfa0-bb1a-f264-ae36c4e949b6/8d88f8ae-35ac-44be-9b25-ec951f350f12_Locations_Feature_-_iOS_-_5.5_inch.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/83/5d/6d/835d6d82-8672-93f9-5f1b-f6b0f158ee18/1210ba6a-7666-4791-84b6-9b541f3e1d4e_Sports__U0026_Events_-_iOS_-_5.5_inch.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/85/49/8d/85498dcd-37ed-883d-079c-75e0ff83708a/56b2dff9-dfa5-4df1-a364-5781d8699d7c_Credentials_Tab_-_iOS_-_5.5_inch.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/9b/ef/4f/9bef4f50-88c6-c546-1055-d6dc681abec3/46a5d071-ad0b-4800-805f-52f62a11038d_Account_Tab_-_iOS_-_5.5_inch.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/ce/d5/96/ced596f9-6915-c2d5-1655-d02ce9cd9394/e8e3f8b6-25f4-4998-81fc-cf5256225c7e_Security_-_iOS_-_5.5_inch.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/f5/e1/6b/f5e16b3f-4375-b950-3527-d2cefe2d2b2f/2c0de84d-4ee2-4a3c-9270-5fa679f099af_H2G_Feature_-_iOS_-_12.9_inch.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/28/09/e4/2809e40b-9b2b-1be7-703a-965d23670464/b587eb24-135a-40de-a892-b48cb48d560d_Locations_Feature_-_iOS_-_12.9_inch.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/7f/89/79/7f897941-6e41-6984-b874-8a2627bf306d/b4111af0-1873-4c2f-9c7a-57d4dc30f201_Sports__U0026_Events_-_iOS_-_12.9_inch.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/24/82/62/248262fb-360e-d251-46b6-ec375822de7d/2b8de611-bc38-46d3-99b5-73f09b6332a0_Credentials_Tab_-_iOS_-_12.9_inch.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/61/4b/01/614b018c-55be-24c8-97fa-10745d3f8295/934fe37b-c15b-4e6e-bfb2-824ab385d786_Health_Pass_-_iOS_-_12.9_inch.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/5e/c8/a4/5ec8a472-809c-9168-86c9-33edab6b29f0/b15e81e8-2a13-4879-9ca5-10d2cc0937c8_Security_-_iOS_-_12.9_inch.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/99/61/4f/99614f8b-652a-38e9-44ed-6c75545e589c/155474a1-f9ff-4b85-8ce9-20af918f51f8_Account_Tab_-_iOS_-_12.9_inch.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAi

When I try to do update my password it tells me the texted passcode is expired but doesn’t send a new one. It’s making it quite difficult to use the app on the phone to make any kind of reservation. | Absolutely the most horrible system ever. I spent three hours today trying to get help. I still have not been able to register. Disney cannot claim the are inclusive and then make the process so difficult! | For some reason in my phone, the das pass option just kept disappearing. Luckily my wife’s did work, but she was often across the park with her parents. (Making it difficult to coordinate.) Das is awesome, and an enabler for my son… the app was very frustrating. | Not so happy trip for our kids | Es lenta | I love disney | To complicated. | Stood in line for a ride. Ride broke made us leave. Then couldn’t use genie plus. Mow k
We at a stupid ride we have at our home town and the wait is 30 minutes. Really disappointed. Our first and of 4 and I want to leave. Flew 5 hrs and paid a ton of money for nothing. | App makes me keep refreshing and will not load hotel | Phone code has been requested 4 times to update my account and after 10 minutes I have received nothing | Constant scrolling, scrolling, scrolling…. More scrolling and the in-app menu isn’t in simplified bubbles or square icons for ease of use. Plus when it comes to making dining-reservations, (especially under “Plan My Day” the app doesn’t provide the restaurant options within the exact park you’ve selected. The assumption here is that you’re booking a reservation at the displayed eating areas within that park but in reality, it’s a mix of diners from Every park; not just the one you’re currently at. Thats where you have the mistakes that are propagated when the user realizes the dining reservations they’ve booked aren't even in the park that they’ve selected for “Plan my Day.”

Colors aren’t really used here for memory/organization to help with purposeful intent with the app. They’re kind of all over the place making it difficult to keep proper track of plans & navigate. 

This is not an app that you can “simply use” while walking amidst and immense crowd in one of the parks. You have to “do your homework” with this app and sift through the concept of the app to better understand what everything is and what they do. 

It’s 80% there, just the confusing layout needs simplifying…

Apps are supposed to make life easier. Plus there’s no GPS directions for your device to guide you to the locations you want to visit within the park. (?) We spend a lot of time just roaming around looking for specific attractions we already had in mind/on our personal itinerary. 

Less is more and better than scrolling to find where you’re at or what you want to plan with it. 
Respectfully, I’d almost rather not even use the app if I’m going to be wandering around aimlessly anyways. 

Using the app gives me anxiety, it’s supposed to be an app for everybody, not for just highly-coordinated people 😒 | If I go on a trip that someone else planned, why do I need to call the help desk to add my pass to the app? I get that this is a theft/loss prevention measure, but you could just send them a notification to confirm my identity. Even better if you could prompt them to send the members in their party the app and pass before the trip so that you don’t have to print the card, streamlining the admissions process.

This could eventually evolve into a locator feature where groups can see where each member is, roughly. Please include dual party consent. | Be cooler if it worked. Great job, Mickey. | I love the app | All of this is way to overwhelming and confusing | Navigation in this app is horrible. | So efficient and when I didn’t understand something the costumer service rep was so nice and helped me and guided me to the right direction!! | Standing here in the hallway, waiting for somebody to come and unlock my door mind you my check-in was much earlier today and I still can’t get in my room | Greetings from Atlanta

I think it's very good because you have the information at hand. | Ricky was very helpful and quite efficient with a question I had from the chat function! | Trying to review my plans and log in using my email. Then site says I can’t view the plans because they are already linked to another user. The name they list is me!!  It says I can’t view the plans because they are listed to me. Please explain that one | This app works fine on my iPhone, but the iPad version is broken and has been for some time. Not fully inop, but many features just won’t load and screens often just freeze up. Please spend some time making sure it works on tablets as well as phones. | If you are going to Disney, you better get it | Confusing | Every year I go to Disney it is impossible to link tickets to my app. Once again I’ve spent 30 minutes and my tickets are linked somewhere but they don’t show up in my app.  This is so frustrating. Absolutely miserable experience for my daughter and me. | Feels so good to be back. Love being here. | App is so hard to navigate and not very intuitive. Very frustrating app. Trying to link all the family members and even scanning the QR code doesn’t work. THIS IS A HORRIBLE APP!! | This app is great, it has a map and it makes getting pictures easy. I am an annual pass holder and it makes life a lot more easier. | Thank you Jared for sending me the information that I need. Your support and information was helpful to me. | For the first time in forever, I got to visit Disney World. Imagine my surprise when I opened this app and was encouraged to accept Google Maps’ privacy policy. 

I don’t feel comfortable being harvested for data by google, so I refused. Now I have no use of the map at all. 

This is a horrible change in the app, and makes it very unusable. | Finally a configuration that is easy to use and find things. | This app tries to do everything but fails at navigation and execution. Many items are not where you would expect it to be. And to make it worse the app is mandatory so you have to deal with the confusion. | In the middle of the hustle and bustle that Epcot can be, back in the country of France, in the world showcase, a restaurant we have not tried before called La Crepery.
Our server, Dora was Magnifique, and the Gallettes and I mean, crêpes were nice change from the typical fair | Did not answer my ? Not helpful at all! | I think for what we pay to come here you shouldn’t put writing over our faces on the pictures | Because it tells you in the rides are open or not but they app can tell you everything like where food is i love it | Not working but when it does pretty user friendly | Too difficult to update email and link accounts | Complicated nickel and dime you every step. Not straight forward | I wish I could make the text bigger. Since you have to be on your phone all the time in the Parks, it would great to be able to see what you are doing. I only have one eye that works because of a brain tumor- and I’m getting old- but I don’t always want to have my readers on sliding down my face in the Florida heat. Please help! | Good app but it

This is great!…. Nope.. total lies… paid my $15 a year … i guess i should just charge people to stay with me so then it will cover the fee? That’s not allowed … my point is BE HONEST! If you say something then DO IT | I have used this app for 11 months now. I have hosted more than 35 Couchsurfers in this period. Out of nowhere yesterday, I got a notification saying my account is temporarily suspended. I have not shared my number or social media in my profile publicly. I have never used profanity in any interactions. I have only provided my contact number to Couchsurfers whom I was hosting or shared it in comments of the events that I host.

After building a profile for this long, I think all my effort might be in vain. I have seen many users with their social media info and links in their bio and somehow that is fine in this very platform.

I am government ID and phone number verified but have not paid the fee to use the app. I am not sure if random occasional temporary suspension is a perk to becoming a free user. If any such bias exists, it should be mentioned in the terms of use. Pretty disheartened to have this experience without doing anything wrong. I am sure many others might have had the same experience so just wanted to write a review. | The app is literally full of old 40 year old men who are treating it like a dating app to pry on young female travelers. The other half is 60 year old gay men who want little boys to be naked in their house. Wouldn’t recommend just book an air bnb or something | Not free | This app is just a  scam, they don’t provide any refund even if you’re not planning using this app | Really good app ☺️ | They only reason why this app exists is the people still have a faith in this wonder land.  Really sad things are most hosts rejected you without any reply…Some of  them only like host females, it seems like hangout dating app….. so rude and disgusting…  DO NOT PAY FOR IT….. | Great | Siempre tengo buenas experiencias con Couchsurfing. Tengo amigos que conocí alojando y viajando por aquí que duran hasta hoy. Gracias | I had used this app on all my travels before the pandemic started. Mostly I used the hangout feature and was fortunate to meet some great people to explore. I am venturing again and so I downloaded the app. I understand adding a fee but why not make it through the App Store? I read several reviews (most are negative) and I don’t feel comfortable giving my credit card information directly. Sad regarding this. Hangouts was a great way to meet people, travelers and locals. | I started using Couchsurfing 2018 and paid for the lifetime verification. I was under the impression that the point of this would be to never have to make another payment. This was not the case. My account is now locked unless I make additional payments. Because of this decision the community on Couchsurfing has died and it is pretty much useless now. Couchsurfing after it changed owners has engaged in extremely dishonest business practices and I don’t plan on continuing to use the app. There are many other good free alternatives online. | Meeting new friends by CS app is the best. | It is stunning that you've managed to bungle the latest update quite so badly. The sort by last login date function does not actually sort all the results, and the ability to filter by people who are accepting guests is now completely unusable (it just doesn't do anything). It seems as thought it will be difficult to make it any less useful than it currently is, but somehow I am confident you will manage it. We, the users, watch your progress with bated breath. | With this app you can go any where you want and find new friends thanks Couchsurfing | First off, this used to be about community and was a free app. Then they introduced a pay wall of 1.99/month, justifying it by saying ‘Covid was really hard.’ Now they’re charging 2.99/month, and this number will almost certainly go up. Whoever bought the app is now using the community for profit… 2ndly I have had fewer and fewer ‘good’ encounters, which has led to me no longer using the app… about 1 out of every 10 people I meet on here is someone who’s like me, and I’m happy to meet. About 7/10 encounters are men who are using this app for hookups… and then 2/10 people on here are just plain weird and ask you to join their nudist household… this app is not what it used to be, shame to say it, but Couchsurfing died years ago. | I had a Couchsurfing subscription for 1 year.  Before my account was set to renew, I cancelled it. However, they charged me anyway. The kicker is my account still says I have a free account and says that I shouldn’t have been charged. I was charged and don’t even have access to the service. To make matters worse, I reached out to the company thinking they could provide me with some clarity on why they charged me. They can’t even find the charge in their system. They keep telling me to reach out to PayPal and Apple. The charge was on my CREDIT CARD, not via PayPal or Apple. They don’t even know how their own system works. Extremely disappointed in Couchsurfing and I’ve lost all faith in their company and app. Whatever you do, do NOT give them any credit card information. This company steals money from the people it claims to “help.” | Couchsurfing, once hailed as the ultimate platform for travelers seeking free lodging and cultural exchange, has seen significant changes that have stirred mixed feelings within its community. The app, renowned for connecting like-minded adventurers and hosts around the globe, has transitioned from a completely free service to a model that now requires payment, a shift that has left many users disenchanted.

Historically, Couchsurfing stood out for its emphasis on cultural exchange and hospitality, fostering a sense of global camaraderie. It was a unique platform where the currency was kindness and the sharing of experiences, rather than money. Hosts opened their homes without any expectation of financial compensation, offering travelers a place to stay and local insights that enriched their journey.

However, the introduction of a payment requirement to use the platform fundamentally alters its original ethos. Users now must pay to verify their accounts or subscribe to access full features, including hosting or staying with others. This move, while understandable from a business sustainability perspective, has sparked a debate on the core values of Couchsurfing.

For long-time users, this shift feels like a departure from the community-first philosophy that made Couchsurfing special. The requirement to pay can be seen as a barrier that might deter new members and diminish the pool of available hosts and surfers, potentially impacting the rich diversity and vibrancy of the community.

Despite these changes, it's important to acknowledge the positives that remain. Couchsurfing continues to be a platform that can offer unparalleled opportunities for cultural exchange and making global connections. The app's functionality, user interface, and the breadth of its community still stand as strong points, providing users with the tools to explore the world in a more personal and profound way than traditional tourism allows.

In conclusion, while the transition to a paid model marks a significant shift in Couchsurfing's journey, the core appeal of connecting with locals and travelers worldwide persists. Users who are willing to pay may still find the app a valuable resource for authentic travel experiences. However, the platform may need to find a balance between financial sustainability and maintaining the spirit of community and openness that defined its early years to retain its place in the hearts of the global travel community. | If you express any kind of boundaries up front, you’ll be met with nothing or aggression. Without boundaries expressed outright, you’ll be flooded with hosts requests. Really shows the intentions of most hosts on the app. Have yet to meet another woman on it. | It functions ok on my iPhone but several things are strange, text fields overlapping, simply aesthetically off. I travel for a living and couch surfing has helped me to save money on hotels. I wish I there was a trip-routing feature on the app. | This app has given me wings to fly to Japan, Sweden, Germany, Kenya, Singapore, India and so many more places. 

I am eternally grateful to couchsurfing and the many wonderful people I met while on the journey. Live long and prosper, CS! | Excelente app para conocer, asistir y ayudar a amigos de todo el mundo. Los invito a conocer La Habana Vieja. Un abrazo desde Cuba. | It’s a great app for meeting friends and traveling new places. Unfortunately, you have to spend a lot of money to get verified, and the app is extremely buggy and poorly written. It frequently takes five seconds to do something very very simple. Or it will forget to notify you that you got a message. Very difficult and unpleasant to use. | Stole $60 from me over 6 years ago when I simply followed their instructions for verification. Never used the app after that because I won’t support scammers. They just tried running my credit card again. They should be charged with financial crimes. | This app is my favorite app of all time but I wish for using the app properly we wouldn’t need to make a payment | I’m not gonna pay for an app like this before i know if it works and isn't a scam. If you're gonna charge for your app charge in the app store, not after download and account setup. | When people ask me about Couchsurfing this is what I tell them…

“It’s like visiting your favorite cousin who happens to live where you want to travel most!

The future people you’ll meet on here, are the kindest souls you could ever find. 
 What greater show of kindness is there than welcoming a complete stranger into your most private space [your home] ??

My experience:

Pick up from the airport 
Cooking meals & being introduced to foods you’d never taste
Guitar serenades
Salsa dancing
Deep late conversations 
Laughs until the sun rises.

These precious people are Ambassadors of there cities & countries, & they give you there time so that you can simply enjoy… | I’ve hosted in the past and had great experiences with travelers. I payed a lump sum to get verified and had to send pictures of my place… which I was fine with. Now they are asking for a fee every month. I’d be willing to pay something when I had a guest but not a fee each month no matter what. | It is truly the buggiest app I’ve ever used, and they charge for it! Disappointing, can’t wait for a better alternative to create a competition for them. | This is the best app to know more about different cultures and languages we feel like a big family helping each others around the world 
I really advise everyone to use it and share it | Hice el pago del año y no se porque en la aplicación aparece un correo electrónico que no es el mío, cuando intento cambiarlo en la app para poder confirmar mi cuenta y poder avanzar no me permite cambiarlo | Search by area on map instead of running multiple searches for myriad municipalities that converge on a given zone. | Knew about Couchsurfing for many years when it was just a website. Reconnected to it now that I’m back traveling and through this app. Glad it exists! | The app has significant bugs (like you can’t login from different devices and I had to contact administrators in order to update my email).  A lot of users are inactive too.  I cancelled my subscription after a couple days.  Definitely not worth it. | Dont download, they stole from me 56 euros for verification!!

They dont want to refund | I just reported this place to the Better Business Bureau. They charged my credit card for a lifetime membership and now I cannot log back into my account because they say it’s inactive. I’m not sure if it was a lifetime or if it was a year, but the point is that is really shady. The verification was only supposed to verify my identity. This company is bad. | Used this since 2007. Now they charge $3 even if you are hosting. Scammers.
App is always buggy on iPhone. The new ownership severely neglects and the wuality deteriorates as more and more hosts leave and more and more freeloaders flood in. Sad. | If there’s a subscription fee for using the service why not just saying it instead of calling it “donation”? How can I trust a company playing tricks like this? | I submitted a request to surf with an ambassador of the couchsurfing app which was denied with no comment. When I requested again for different days and inquired if his denial, he did the same thing again. I go to his reviews and see only white people and people of Spanish descent, so of course, I took this to be racially motivated. I left a review stating that Winston will approve or deny your request based on race and that was removed as they considered it “bullying and harassment.” I’ve had several interactions such as this and couch surfing always seems to back up the racist, coincidence huh? | CouchSurfing and its community is what the World needs more of!! I started 10 years ago and it changed my life. Now about the app: The good: The app keeps getting better. Features are really useful. I love that you can read the communication history after joining a Hangout chat. The bad: Bugs with notifications, I get notified sometimes hours after messages are sent. The messaging in Hangouts feature is quite slow, people quickly move to WhatsApp. I wish the feature ""people traveling to your city"" would also be in the app, and not only on the website. | The first thing this app wants is a per month fee (or per year) or else u can’t use the app. Then they encourage u to spend $60 to get verified so you’ll be able to find a host faster. I paid $60 + $15 yearly fee = $75. I sent about 20 requests to ~ 20 hosts in Los Angeles area. I was rejected by all 20. I suspect it’s b/c I am new to couch surfing and don’t have any references. 

But then it begs the question… How do I get references if hosts will not accept me??!! My advice to travelers wanting to save money - spend money on a well rated hostel eg use the Hostel World app. The $75 I spent is easily a one night stay at a top rated hostel | So what I’m seeing is the movement has been hijacked my greedy people,, seeing as you can’t access ANYTHING without paying first, uh yeah that’s called a scam people run away lol | Don’t used 
Don’t like Muslim and Arabic people 
Please give home 1 stars all time | Don’t pay anything! It blames COVID for lack of activity but, it seems to be just a way to get money because you can’t access the app until you pay. Then, you see no one has been active for 3-9 years!! Even the reviews are old!

I’m a computer software trainer, usually pretty good with these things, but this app constantly has me befuddled. I eventually figured it out, but then when I need to go back two months later, I’m again confused. | I think Puerto Rico is underwater. | We love to travel.  Middle class Texans, been to a lot nations, all 50 states and most of Texas’ farm to market and back paved/unpaved roads. Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao on our wish list then at 87 we’ll take a break. | The map is poor quality and hard to navigate but it gets the job. Zooming close enough to clearly see borders is frustrating on very small island countries. | If I purchase Visited Pro version, is it gonna be a monthly or yearly subscription? What additional features will be available? | STAY AWAY!! This app supports consumption of endangered species and exploitation of native cultures.  Travel apps are fun, and there are many many others that don’t do this. Choose a different one. | Can you please make the country flag size bigger. | I have never wrote a review EVER… but this may be the WORST app I have ever gotten in my life. Very frustrating to work. I LITERALLY had to type where I lived over 5 times. I could not get passed it no matter what. I just want a simple app that tracks the places I’ve been. Do NOT DOWNLOAD. | Nothing saves when I put it into the app. I emailed them months ago no response. Waste of money and I would like it back | Just keeps asking me what country I live in and what city. When hit next, it asks the same question. It’s an endless loop. | You have to pay the monthly subscription fee to even add the places you’ve been. | This app is great for travel and aspirational travel planning. Lots of cool features, I ended up paying for the full package. Tech support was fast and helpful when I had an issue. | Love this app! I just wish it had some better options and visuals for sharing maps and progress with friends and on social media. | The best thing about this App is that the owner actually responds to multiple request to add cities!  Easy and fun way to track my visits to 54 countries to date…. Including many non-tourist destinations. | It used to be you zoom in and see the subdivisions of the country. They got rid of that and now you have to click the country, then click a few other things. Nowhere near as seamless. Please bring the old functionality back! | The site keeps asking me to update where I live and won’t do anything else. | I have fun marking off places I have visited and being able to see my progress.  Also, the developers are great, as I have provided feedback and content and the team updates the app as needed.  Great job! | How is possible that you has to agree to receive thousands of emails that you don’t want to use the app? Plus has to pay extra for add remove but no email scam chain? Blame on you. | Sorry, if I can’t even try the app without signing up for an email list, it is a non-starter. I should not be required to sign up for marketing junk mail before I even know if I like the app. If this gets fixed/changed then maybe I could give a better rating. | I have been traveling a lot in recent years & decided I wanted to start logging locations. This was the 2nd app I decided to try, but I couldn’t even get past the set up because it required me to choose my home city off a list that didn’t contain my home city. It did not offer any way to manually enter my home city, and no way to bypass that selection. So, needless to say, I deleted the app. | Recommend multiple family profiles so kids are encouraged to discover as much/more as their parents | The app doesn’t load | This app looks so cool, but when I try to sign up, there is an error that pops up on the screen. I used different emails too. I don’t know what’s wrong!

EDIT: The app is super helpful. The customer support was amazing. Thank you! | Well I’d like to review this app for its features or literally anything but I can’t even use it. I try to make an account and it won’t get off the loading screen. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times. | Loved this app. But won’t load since the update yesterday! | I had been using this app and enjoyed it, but logged in today to a screen asking me to agree to a privacy policy. There was an additional checkbox asking permission for the app to send me promotional mail. I left it unchecked and submitted and was greeted with “Whoops! You must accept everything or delete your account. The two buttons to proceed were literally “ok” and “delete account”. I didn’t say ok. How insulting | Buggy. I downloaded this app and after 15 minutes of trying to see the scratched countries, I gave up. All I could see was a yellow dot where I live. I changed the water color and the whole map changed to that color except for the yellow dot. Waste of time. | Got this app to log the places I’ve traveled to and even bought the almost $10 packet which includes no ads, unlocks cities, regions etc., of where you’ve traveled. However, every time I wanted to save a city for example in Mexico, I wanted to log Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Tulum.. it would not save no matter how many times I pressed the BEEN button. Even restarted my phone to make sure the issue was not on my end.

Please fix this! | I liked the app but even after you pay to get rid of the ads they force you to subscribe to advertising email list.  It’s either subscribe or delete your account, the only options, I deleted my account t.  I got fooled. | Seriously? 8.99 for this? You can not even exporta decent picture of where you have been in the map. | Useless if you’ve only traveled domestically. | I’ve tried multiple times, and even deleted the app, reinstalled it, and still no luck. | Get ready to be spammed. They sell your email and all sorts of weird malicious spam starts reaching out to you | This is a good way to keep track of world travels. It works great. | Just trying to record countries visited not give you all my info. Ugh. | So it good with the countries. I was trying to update cities I been and lived and it would let me add. It only updates countries. It also isn’t user friendly. I have to re-teach myself how to reset the city I currently live (still not accurate on my app). Also, something I can get over if the city updates work, is it has plenty of Territories as separate counties which love, but it picks and chooses which ones (such as Canadian territories not being separated from the country) and it also doesn’t acknowledge all disputed territory very well. For example Morocco on it’s map has territory that isn’t part of it, it is UN accurate, but if your going UN accurate, then a territories shouldn’t be separate. So Puerto Rico is part of the United States and not independent. I do prefer that it separates it. But I am annoyed that it picks and chooses for you who owns what land. To be honest I wouldn’t have even cared about most of this if the upgrades I paid for actually worked. | Have to enter cities and countries twice. For example; entering city as Barcelona in Spain won’t show Spain as a country visited. You must enter the country as a different entry. Not worth $8 or anything. A waste. | The app itself is fine. But to use it you must accept terms that you accept unlimited spam from them and their partners. There are other apps that don’t do that. There are plenty of websites that do not for free. | This app REQUIRES you to sign up and forces subscription (says you can op-out at anytime).

You can NOT op-out.  Apple should remove this app as a scam to customers. | I downloaded the app because it also has the list of places, food, capitals, parks, etc.  Unfortunately, the app is missing the option to filter searches. When searching for cities in the US, it shows a list of all the cities in alphabetical order and not by state - it would’ve been convenient to filter the cities by state in addition to having a search. Also, when selecting the destinations visited under the list tab, it does not filter lista by “been” or “want to visit”. | This is a good app and I even paid to remove ads and to unlock all the features. HOWEVER, it needs to give more control to the user. They collect so much of your personal information. It’s like either use it and let us collect these information, or leave it. Also, I was forced to sign up to their newsletter. It said I can withdraw from their newsletter at anytime but there is no option for that in the map. I paid for the premium features but you know what? Don’t. None of the premium features were worth it. Let me start off by cities. You can type and choose the cities that you’ve been to and cities that you want to visit. But that is it. You can’t even see a list of those cities that you want to visit, let alone a map of it. Looks like they made it easy for them to collect our information. Inspiration doesn’t have anything. It said it would show travel photos. The only photo it shows is the thumbnail when you select from want/been. If you do download this app, please do go to privacy section and read the “What personal information do we collect?” Section. So far, what a waste of money it has been. If it gets improved, I will update my review. | After you setup your account, the app requires you to both (1) accept their privacy policy and (2) agree to receive marketing emails from them. If you do not do both, it offers a “Delete Account” option. If you choose that, it then tries to charge you $2.99, rather than simply deleting your data. | Absolutely cool, only one issue though; There should be an option for the places you have lived and where you are currently living to be different. | Be prepared to pay $8.99 the ONLY feature you get for free is to select your countries visited. All other content is to be paid for. There are tons of apps out there for free that will give you that. Save your money. | Can I change the email address associated with my account? | I love this app bec it lets me track the places I have been and gives me stats on the travel I have done ! | Love the app except for 1 part. It doesn’t show the different countries for the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are all separate countries and should be counted as such. | App is trash and waste of time | The app seemed interesting. I downloaded it, installed it launched it. First thing that comes up it  asks for your email. App immediately uninstalled.

Even after paying the ridiculous upgrade fee, the app is burdened with irrelevant and irritating ads that take up half of the screen. Just use Google Maps—free and much better. | Useless without platform info. Hundreds of trains and options. There is no way you could get to where you’re going without platform info. Don’t bother with this app. | This app is fine but when it came down to it I just ended up using Google maps to navigate in Japan instead. The app would freeze up for me a lot and I just ended up uninstalling. | Highly recommend for anybody traveling to Japan. Particularly anyone taking either the metro, Subway, or even Shinkansen. You just need to type in your starting point and destination, you can now only the quickest route, but also the fare you need to pay at the station. Worth getting the paid version since you get to see the list of stations and you have to travel. | Too many ads and limited navigation. Google Maps has better navigation info | I just downloaded the app on iPhone 14-  I signed up and registered and also verified my email info and clicked yes for location access on my phone-  then I got a blank screen- I tried turning my phone off- the app just gives me a blank screen when I open it on my iPhone-  frustrating- made me feel like this was a potential scam to give access to my phone | Anything worth using cost money. Might as well use Google Maps for free. | This could have been a good app if it focused on its rail timetable and planning strengths.  Instead, it is cluttered with distracting and irrelevant offers and information for things one can search and find in a dozen other better content sites.  This obscures and undermines the rail planning function which could have made the app uniquely worthwhile.  It is not a question of paying for ad-free premium, it’s a question of app focus to do one thing well instead of ten things poorly. | I can get it to login perfectly on an iPad, but it keeps saying that the password or email is incorrect when I try to login via my phone. | Despite having an expensive subscription service, it is LOADED with ads. The home page of the app is a landing page for advertisements. It will constantly send you push notification ads. The directions are marginally better than Google/Apple maps, it’s 100% not worth it. | We had our own passes purchased direct from JR Rail so it was not very useful. Seemed “marketing heavy” to encourage purchases for other tours. | Does not show route maps! Even for paid version. Don't waste your money. Travel instructions lack clarity. One good feature: it *will* tell you when to leave Point A to arrive at Point B, at a specific time. Other than that, Google maps is far easier to use, plan, & view your route while you're traveling. | We had some events pre planned and I can’t add them. They only show you booking through them. I can find the routes etc, but definitely not worth the money if you just need help with some stops. | Great app when it was free | Latency is bad. Itinerary function is confusing and useless. | This app is great, but…..  it always deletes my saved train routes. I live and work in japan, and it’s very annoying when I look to see what train I can take, and it deletes ALL my saved routes. To the point I have to save them all over again. This has happened multiple times. | I’ve never been to Japan before, don’t speak Japanese. Planned my whole trip using this, paid for premium, it’s worth it!! Would not have been able to get around the subways without it. | Haven’t been able to get it to work from day one!  Deleted it and found something else. | I’m trying to use the Osaka subway route map and it “can’t find” any station I’m trying to search for.  Useless! | 乱扣费 | I used to love this app, but they’ve made some very questionable changes lately. Seeing the station list used to be free, now they’re making you pay for premium to look at it. I’ve also seen a bunch more popups bothering me to upgrade. I’ll be using a different app from now on. | We traveled most of Japan and found google to be better. Navigation seemed hard and it didn’t seem to come up with interesting things to do. 
I struggled to find the right trains to get on and just gave up as it was easier in google. I found the app a waste of money. Shame I had high hopes. 
Third visit to Japan with rail pass and three kids. | Just the free portions of this are worth 5 stars. The routing system is a must when traveling. The platforms, changes, and times were spot-on. This made a 2 week trek around Japan by rail east. | Fails immediately. Continues to fail as you struggle to use it. Paid for upgrade but no upgrade was applied. Use google maps. It’s better and it’s free. | This is a great rail app for free. I was using the other japan official app but it wasn’t showing my JR trains effectively, so i switch to this one and gets my planned and reserved trains. You can use both if you need to but if you want a one and done than this app is it. | I’m unable to pick other bullet trains it just defaults to one | I have been using this app for years now, and it has been very helpful as a resident in Japan. With one of the more recent updates, they started to really push the paid plans. This took features that were free and monetized them. The station list for my route is no longer viewable which was great for tracking my time. 
In addition, they hide the cost of the premium plan to get you to buy it easier. Very sad.
I will be looking for a new app to use. | Have been using the app all over Japan for the past two weeks and it has performed flawlessly. The information is accurate, detailed and reliable. It is easy to use and has lots of great features, like letting you create a menu of your hotel names and addresses so you can quickly search for the best route to or from wherever you’re staying. You can also easily filter searches by whatever pass you may have and/or type of transportation you prefer to use. If you’re traveling around Japan on your own itinerary, you’ll want to have this app. | Great info on train times and routes but I wanted the navigation feature. Even with my pocket wifi it never worked. No turn by turn, no voice prompts, and it was very laggy. Wish I could get my $20 back. We ended up using Google maps. Not only was it more up to date but it tells you which entrance and exit to use. It even suggests which car to use for the fastest exit! | This shows the proper routes with Japan Rail Pass.  Google Maps won't work since it's always showing non-pass routes.  Great app. | The routing is okay but misses several available trains which is a big nono (didn’t get the thunderbird JR booked for me and which Google maps happily suggested), the interface is clunky, but most annoyingly despite having paid $14.49 for a (30 days!) premium I still got ads in route planning. What the heck Navitime?!? | This is a great app for someone visiting Japan as well for people living here. You get all the shopping information from electronics to clothing shops and their discount and taxes save. I haven’t try the Navi drive yet. I hope it will save me a lot of time from using google map which usually take me to all the alleys in Japan before my destination. I like the train directions of this app. | This app was a godsend during our trip to Japan! We used it constantly, so helpful to find the right route, especially with it telling me if the route would be covered by my JR Pass. HIGHLY recommend downloading if traveling to Japan. | I would love the app but it will not let me but a subscription no matter how much I try, which severely limits my ability to plan my trip. | This app is absolutely indispensable for travel within Japan on the rail, subway and bus systems. The search results are clearly laid out with station numbers and your particular track information. Apps like Hyperdia are GROTESQUELY complicated in comparison. 

Couple this app with a WiFi hotspot ( I used Japan Wireless) and you will never be lost. I’d give it 10 Stars if I could. | Best app among all the navigating apps I downloaded and tried out while in Japan. The most helpful feature was that it would tell you which train to take (on a JR Pass), which station to catch it, what time it would leave, and the track that it leaves from. Now if only someone would develop an app to guide you through the
maze of underground tunnels and shopping corridors to find the right exit close to your hotel. | Tried finding train route from Tokyo to my resident city, Tsukuba, Japan, but the app gave me wrong information. I have taken this route dozens of time using the excellent Hyperdia website. But this app not only gave me a bad route, it could not even find the Tsukuba train station. Tsukuba is the Japan Science City and the second biggest city in Ibaraki Prefecture, so this is shameful. Do not get this app. instead, use the Hyperdia website. | If you need a navigation, how to get around japan, guidance on how to take the train this is it for you. I love this app. | One of the best applications I’ve ever used. It always works with no issues. I’m planning my trip and this app gives me ideas where to go and what to see. Definitely will use it in Japan. Absolutely love it! | The amount of information given in this app is wonderful. Location of a.t.m’s, money exchange, free WiFi, and closest stations is great. Travel route are better than the app that my native japanese friend has, with multiple routes to choose from and distinct JR pass routes. Estimation on how much non JR trains cost and taxi travel is spot on. I’ve been to Japan several times and this app made this trip even easier. I utilized all its features on a daily basis. I thank the developers for a well thought out and very usable application. | If you love to travel your going to like this a lot 😂🎁♥️ | I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do it here. It must be the best app there’s to travel using your JR pass. Has good routes, can optimize for JR pass, and even shows the platform numbers which is super useful. | Very smooth great for trains ferries even busses. I wish that there’d be English characters for busses so you can search for bus stops, also to be able to look up nearby busses, maybe add/incorporate stops. Also maybe even a biking route option. 

Finds places google maps doesn’t have. And is much easier to see all times that bus stop leaves as compared to google maps.

I use google maps just to get the name of the bus stop I need sometimes and plug that into this app or use the location of the bus stop. And I’m have reach my destination.

These would all be very cool extras. As it stands, this is a fantastic app. | Definitely your GO TO app for finding your train options. I used this over HYPERDIA app that others recommended. The app helped me in booking and planning my trips on the Shinkansen using JR rail pass. | It’s very accurate. It gives you the exact time and information of where to go. Now, I am an expert with trains! | Place I call, “the HOME of my SOUL”.

I was born near by town of Tomonoura.
A long long time ago! 
Went to the U.S.A. to explore my curiosities. Then found the freedom!!!!! Decided to stay! Got married. Two kids! Every trip I, we, made to my native land, Japan, our trip included Tomonoura!!!! Now my kids want to visit there as their pilgrimage! I feel so warm inside of the core of my heart when I get greeted by the sign saying “WELCOME HOME”. In Japanese!

There must be so many beautiful places to visit in Japan but Tomonoura will be one of the places you can enjoy Japan’s ONCE UPON A TIME! | Don’t buy the full feature. Navigation very difficult to follow and slow to update. Google maps worked better. This was only useful in finding train stations and platform. | I gave this app 3 stars because numerous times, the stores I wanted to find/shop at came up with no information. This is disappointing because they immediately appeared when I googled the same store name with all the information including a map and directions. 
While other portions of the app are fine, for me if I want to go somewhere and this app can’t even tell me it exists I’m sorry to say it’s usefulness is closer to a 1 star... especially considering I had to pay $7.95!!! | I used this for my week in Tokyo and it was amazing for getting you where you want to go.

Cheapest flights available, which is so helpful for a college student like myself! 10/10 do recommend. | Their customer service team is full of liars. Do not try the general English line | Great website and super cheap prices, but the app is constantly crashing and is nearly unusable. | It’s showing high prices compare with other Apps | I booked a flight one night for $344, which was then cancelled because “The price went up as I was purchasing the ticket”. I checked the next day and it was the same price. I called and asked why I’m not able to book the next day after checking and they said “It’s unavailable” so I asked “why is it still in the website” and the lady kept putting the blame on me and avoiding the question and told me “You can pay over the phone the higher price and a $10 manual payment fee”. Absolutely ridiculous. You’re better off using Expedia | I love this app I got best rates | Every time I try to view my trips, it bugs and just closes the app. | Since downloading the app back in November of 2023, I have not been able to see any information regarding my trip abroad after logging in. I instead received the message saying “Something went wrong try again later”. Please fix | Doesn’t give you any more of a discount on flights than any other site and often makes you flights non-refundable. I don’t see the point of the site and would not recommend using it. | My flight was canceled due to the 737 groundings and the airline texted me to notify me of this and said I would receive an email with more information about next steps. I never received such an email from the airline. 4hrs later I received an email from student universe notifying me of this change, asking if I wanted to accept the absurd new flight they booked me on. This was after I had already tried to call the airline about the absurd new flight (2days after my original departure date and an 18hr layover), and called student universe to try and get a better flight. I thought this issue was handled after I spoke to the second student universe representative - the first one had no idea what he was doing. I rebooked a flight on a new airline, as I was told I was getting a refund, only to learn when I landed, that they still had not contacted the airline for a refund, but had instead booked me on yet another absurd alternative flight. Just absolutely horrible experience. I thought student universe was a great company for the prices, but their customer service is not worth the lack of price. They will not be in any way helpful if any thing happens to your flight. You can tell them what you want to happen, that you cannot add 2 days to your trip, that you want to decline the offered alternative flights and just get a refund, but no. They don’t listen and don’t fight for you as the customer | difficult to use it. no live chat. | Run if you plan to use it! | I am trying to look for a ticket and it’s showing me prices but then it says the discounted ones aren’t available unless I verify my status and when I upload the document it just keeps saying uploaded and never actually finishes and I waited for over 10 minutes | This app charged me $30 extra for the flight when compared to other airline sites and to cancel it within 24 hr booking they are charging $40. | I recently had a frustrating experience with an airline and Student Universe. I opted not to take the initial leg of my flight and used alternative means to reach my destination. However, to my dismay, the airline cancelled my return flight without offering any compensation. This left me with no choice but to purchase a new return ticket at additional cost.

When I reached out to Student Universe for assistance, they were unhelpful, citing a clause in their contract which states that if a passenger does not use the first leg of their journey, they forfeit the entire trip. This policy feels quite unfair and was not adequately highlighted at the time of booking. The lack of flexibility and support in this situation was disappointing, and it’s important for potential customers to be aware of such policies and the implications they might have on their travel plans. | I can’t even look at available flights without the app crashing. I had this installed for about 2 hours before trashing it. | They charge you higher than just booking on a regular site | The site not even work when you try selecting from where u want fly it’s not even give you option don’t waste time for this app…. | Wasn’t able to print out itinerary, or save to My Wallet. I can’t find my ticket in the app at all, don’t like this app. | This app is so slow to load, regardless of what kind of connection I’m using. I can’t even load the hotel page because it takes 5+ minutes. | Super easy to use and amazing student discounts. With all my school loans, I will take any student perks I can get! Thanks StudentUniverse! :) | This was a waste of time and false advertising! The prices are the same on any other website. Don’t waste your time or phone storage downloading the app!! | Amazing | This app is deceitful and manipulative | It says I need to update the app but there is no update to offer on apple and I cannot use the app. | It promts me to update but I don’t see the update in appstore. Can even use the app. | If you download and open the app, it will tell you to upgrade to the newest update, then take you back to the app store ….. but there is no update . | i heard about this app and decided to compare air fares from google flights. i was able to locate the same exact flight on google and compared it to the one on this app. i found that google flights’ fare was 6 dollars cheaper than this app. 
if you want to verify this, just pick a random flight on google flights and look it up on this app and compare to see. | Because I book tickets for my mom
And I request for wheelchair but 
She can not get any wheelchair 
Tickets is India Ahm to Washington DC
Any airport | Student Universe is my go to app for flight bookings. | Oh wow, did not really touch food ever in this place | Worst platform to book the flight. If we want to postpone or prepone the flight they are charging more when compared with other platforms. Better to book a flight in direct airline sites. I don’t want to give rating. | I had a horrible experience from airport staff and contacted studentuniverse but they were unresponsive. I tried contacting them multiple times. I contacted my bank and the airlines directly who gave me the refund for $1700 for the inconvenience. But these crazy people, not only did they rebilled my account after4 MONTHS with $1700 again, even after telling all the details what happened, they as a merchant straightaway lied to the airlines to finally rebilling the amount from my card again. This is the worst website you could choose for getting $10 bucks of discount and then you’re going to suffer later and you could never expect any help from them. Studentuniverse are very active only when it comes to sucking money out of your pocket. They told the airlines I cancelled the ticket, but in reality I was talking about the one way ticket where i experienced this whole situation, not during the return ticket which I cancelled later. (For which I never received the refund btw) I would never ever recommend anybody to book from this website it’s a total scam they don’t care about the passengers at all!!! | Won’t save nothing, plus very difficult to communicate with and customer executives aren’t supportive | It’s cheaper if you go through the website of the air line | I’ve been using this app for about a year and a half without any issues. However, since the last update, it’s been crashing while searching for flights and it’s now impossible to use. | Just there was an easy way to add trip details to my calendar. I have to do it manually. And when I share my trip info with my gf, she says she has to enter in my email address and confirmation number to view the itinerary—so many unnecessary steps.

Product owner needs to ask themself why they chose to implement the ability to explore next trip based on user’s zodiac sign over the ability to add to calendar. Bad choice IMO. | A friend of mine told me that this was a good app to find good prices as a college student. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to see if it’s as great as she told me because it wouldn’t let me confirm my student status, and I’m scare of but the tickets without doing that first because what if they raise my prices last minute because of that? What if they end up charging me more claiming that it’s because I never confirmed my student status? If anyone can help me with that I’ll be more than thankful and happy to change my review | I fly a lot, a lot a lot, I flew booking with student universe too, gave them second chances at thought maybe it’ll save money. NO. Please listen it’ll save you so many headaches, they won’t and can’t save you anything. Absolute scam, their whole MO is making customers think they’re paying less, but they NEVER BOOK YOU WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. They always say “economy” when you book BUT ITS ACTUALLY ECONOMY LIGHT AT BEST. Not even light, the ones with absolute no carry-on/baggage at all, last second tickets that other companies toss away. If they tell you that going in, whatever, but be prepared to pay an extra $300 USD for every international flight (the whole flight is only $400). There’s no way to know what flight they’re booking for you since they lie and say “don’t know baggage allowance” and you don’t know until a few days before when you can check in to your airline… It’s so fuqed up who would book an international flight without even a CARRY ON??? The whole thing is so shady, so deceitful, zero transparency. They know what they’re doing, ridiculous company that scams “students” without being upfront on what kind of flights are being booked. Their profit margins must be huge but they have zero ethical values. Hopefully they get sued someday, this happens for every. flight. I’ve. Booked. Basically booking.com with less transparency and false assurance of “helping poor students.”🤦‍♂️ a lot of you might be like me, false hope it’ll save you something, please I beg you just avoid, you have enough stress on your plate as is. | Way to expensive | I’ve always had a lot of years of student universe. Their stuff are super helpful and quick to rearrange flight plans. Their app is easy to use and I love their prices. | I haven’t found any relevant deals for me and decided to delete the app because I also didn’t feel comfortable giving any ID information, but the app simply won’t give you the option to delete your account! | Love it. Short, Sweet & to the Point. | Easy to sign up but I did not see anywhere to confirm a flight or check-in.  Rates are ridiculously inexpensive! | ^^ | There literally just isn’t a reason to use StudentUniverse. They add fees with no clear benefit to using their services and terrible assistance. They’re trying to charge +$700 for a flight change. Save yourself the headache and just book straight through an airline, I’m not even sure why this company exists. | Twice my booking was cancelled for stupid reason.

Over 3 weeks I booked 18 nights and saved an average of $18 per night booking through Priceline. The app encompasses ease of use, fast booking, and the lowest price. | Conviene , great selection and reasonable pricing! | I have used Priceline and a number of occasions. Most recently I flew to Austin. I had to wait an hour for a rental car. And was rushed through the line. Was charged for the rental car again and had to argue with Fox rental car. Went to the hotel and the hotel told me it wasn't paid for as well. I told the hotel it was paid through Priceline. I thought all is well until after I checked out and they tried to charge my credit card for the room. I called Priceline, spoke with someone through chat, told me that the rental car charge would be refunded that it was a hold, but it clearly stated it was six days at $29.95 for the car. They would take care of the hotel and get back to me in a couple of days why I never heard anything back. I told the person I was chatting with I would never use Priceline again and I was very disappointed in dissatisfied with them. And she could say she was sorry to hear that. Have a good day. | We have been having to stay extended stays for medical treatments the Priceline options are amazing and save me money every time | If things go wrong with your booking, and sometimes they do, you do not want to be booking with Priceline. What is the point of a customer service if all they say to you is ""I CAN'T help you"". They hide fees from hotel to make the price seem smaller but eventually get you at the end with extra hotel fees which are not disclosed . You are better off going with someone else. | Hi I tried several different apps and several different websites and priceline was the only one who got me what I needed with a fair price thank you priceline | Great… | I have now been ripped off twice after paying in full for rental cars- I have (and ways use) my private insurance on rental cars, but when getting to rental pickup told I must use their jacked up coverage (one even said i did not have “tire” coverage so insert $35 a day extra or screw the trip and go pay another carrier . This added almost $1000 unexpected on a long trip last year | Terminé pagando el doble de lo que ustedes me cobraron en el app, por un auto, y muchos requisitos que ustedes no aclaran al usar el app. York rent car el peor servicio de rentar un auto | Very bad application, I booked a car when I arrived at the airport and came to pick up the car, they refused and said that they had canceled my reservation. They didn’t return the money, they told me to call this number 1-877-477-5807, here they also told me that they couldn’t help. I didn't get my $330 back. The lawyer advised me to sue. | When folks complain they they can’t find a good deal on hotels or airfare, I often do a quick Priceline search and share the findings. More often than not, they’re amazed that I found a good deal so quickly. And if you have flexible travel plans, it’s even better — not always the case with my travel, but sometimes Priceline finds the best deals for family trips.  Recommended! | I really needed this to book a room and every time I tried all I was met with was error message stating that something went wrong on their end. Totally wasted my time I will never use Priceline again or recommend. | Every time a package deal is set for a low price as soon as you go to book it the price goes up | I used the express deals for Little Rock Hotels and received the hotel I was hoping to get!  Couldn’t be more pleased!❤️ | I’ve had Priceline for years! I’ve never been disappointed either! I’d recommend this app to friends and family! | They tricked customer with express deal by show you three hotels, two are fair, one of them is very bad, and nobody would seeking to booked. I found out after tried few times, they always pick the worst one for you, no exceptions. They ruined my travel. I will never use this app again. | So I’ve been using this app for the past 18 stays that I have done and the hotel says the price I’m paying is more than if I went strictly through them I like wow I thought I was saving a few bucks and I’m actuality I’m not! Great app just a few hiccups over all I’ve saved a few bucks but I can honesty say you would thought it would be more discounted after 18 trips not to mention had a hard time getting my money back not long ago where I was charged for the wrong days!! | I’ve got to stop using Priceline! | Forced me and my family to sleep in our car after they didnt send my reservation to the hotel. Had me pkaying phone tag with them from 11pm -3am , the whole time im thinking surely these oeople will correct their mistake, guess what! At 3 am after taking my money they tikd me their was nothing they can do to help me so me and my family were forced to sleep im a cold car. The next day the abuse continued when they denied my refund!! So after being treated like dirt the night before i had to call them 6 times the next day to fight amd beg for my money back ridiculous treatment of a customer ! Never again! Your taking your chamces using this app | I want to thank Priceline, for the chats they are so helpful! | Love the discounts and how easy it works. | I made a car reservation for pickup at IAH, what I wasn’t provided was good directions of how to pick up that car, including where the rental counter was located!  Exasperated and tired, I called the customer service and they couldn’t help or even direct me where or how to get help….  You see, Priceline forgot to let me know the reason I couldn’t find Budget Rental signs is because they closed their area a apparently merged with Avis….in the pickup area, so the reason why the budget signs led to an empty area!!!  I was walking around looking for signs that didn’t exist, except at the rental desk!

Finally, I find the rental desk with the help of half a dozen helpful travelers…wait over an hour in line and….Then I was surprised further with a $250 “extra costs” deposit on top of the rental fees!  I chose not to use my debit card because that was a $300 hold and a credit inquiry??

What the heck is going on Priceline, that you couldn’t at least notify me of IAH rental policies??

Now  last but not least…I didn’t even get the full sized car, I booked, I got a jeep compass, terribly uncomfortable and it had not even been cleaned!  Cup holders had sticky spills, dash had splashed coffee drink and the passenger seat was full of food debris between the top and bottom of the back of the seat, where you sit….It also smelled like a strange combination of mold and air freshener…I told the attendant about it..she wasn’t surprised…

After my experience at the counter and observation of another customer having similar problems, there was no way I was going back to the rental counter…

This certainly was a “deal” ! | I’ve tried most of the travel site apps, and I always get consistently the best deal with Priceline | Both frontier airlines, the days inn, and car rentals have told me in the past week that my Priceline reservation was a scam and they would not honor it and needed to charge me a different way. I have used Priceline for years without issue however recently there has been a disastrous lowering of quality and accountability. 

Disappointing and unclear if the issue will be resolved…. Hundreds of dollars and lots of stress with Priceline kicking the accountability to third parties…. Frontier tells me I have a scam reservation yet the charge on my card is from frontier not Priceline and Priceline does nothing. 

Hard to tell if the quality issue will ever be resolved. Used to be a good service. I’ve been embarrassed and lied to multiple times over the past few weeks by Priceline and thier third parties. | Always amazing hotel prices | Priceline app saved us more than other websites. | Be careful when picking a Priceline deal? You might end up with a motel not a hotel? 
Check to make sure you have a cancellation available!! | Don’t ever use them. And please read the important things to know in the very hidden  place. They will not refund and it is just sad. 
Never again. | Booked Baymont through Priceline and it was the worst experience, very dishonest and unclean place. After almost two weeks I finally was able to resolve it enough to leave it alone. Then Priceline decides to give me this hotel in express deals, and when I point this out they refuse to change to another of the three possible properties. Indirectly asking their customer to return to this place and take on that battle again. In fact they offered no assistance what so ever with this problem. Priceline has dropped below the brow do yourself a favor and book anywhere else. | DO NOT USE PRICELINE!!!! Booked two rooms back to back, one at our halfway travel point and another at our final destination. First hotel we got to, which was paid and confirmed, well when we got there suddenly they wanted an additional $200, so we were forced to sleep in our car, contacted Priceline and it was a horrible experience with no help what so ever. Next day we get to our next hotel, and let me say is was absolutely disgusting, absolutely disgusting. Bed had no protector on it and you could see stains through the single sheet they provided ‘no blanket’, pieces of wall and ceiling were falling into the floor, food was on the walls, toilet and tub were dirty, mattress was absolutely disgusting, carpet was nasty, smelled awful, tv didn’t worn properly, inhabitable. We went to the front desk as well as called Priceline and got nowhere. NEITHER of these rooms we stayed in, the first one we couldn’t even check in. I will post EVERYDAY in one way or another until I am refunded | Would give 0 Starsvif I could! Booked a package deal with Priceline to Waikiki Hawaii!! Have been getting the run around with Priceline since before our trip started. We booked for 6 people and they booked our hotel for 2 with their partner (getaroom.com), therefore no way for the hotel to help us. The hotel would only allow 4 of us per fire code. I have contacted Priceline for 2 months now since our trip trying to resolve the under booking. Even have an email from Priceline’s Customer Relations team stating that the reservation should have been for the 6 booked and paid for guest. I have spent over 30 hours on the phone, email, and chat with no resolution. Will never use Priceline again!!! | I swear by this app | I’ve saved a lot with Priceline over the years. On a recent trip to Florida I found a rental car for $15.00 a day, and saved on my last hotel trip too. ExpressDeals are great last minute ways to save. | I’ve been using this for many years and they always amaze me with how they find was to get prices down. So keep up the good work | Overall it is okay with this app.  But something annoying is with the coupons.  They sent us coupon notifications on the phone, but these notifcations or coupons do not show up in the Notications or Coupons tabs on the app.

So it is not easy to use the coupon code if it does not appear on the app. | been using it for years and until i actually got to a level i had VIP status i thought it was really good but being gold VIP amd platinum every now and again if you are willing to roll the dice on a hotel or plane ticket last minute for good price is all you know is where you are going and have a place to stay once there i have gotten some amazingly great deals last minute and ended direct flights with no weird stopover! Love being a Priceline VIP | No choice of rental car companies, I was booked with Thrifty. When I tried to get Priceline to change providers, they wouldn’t, even when I offered to pay more. Now, the day of my mid-day, Thursday arrival, there are 20 people in line. Beware. It’s not just Thrifty. It’s Priceline that I blame for this. | Love this app Priceline
It really does save while on Vacation 
Thank You so much

VP Member | I enjoy using Priceline because they make it easy and efficient to book my reservations at prices that are far better than l could obtain on my own. | Website is user friendly… Great hotels to pick from… make sure you read the comments from the customers… check the rating.. | Amazing!! Quick n easy!! :))) | Do not even think about to buy tickets from this app its show cheap but after you pay then problem come to you at the checking in the airport unbelievable at chalking they make me buy another ticket from $ 1131 I put another $ 2200 at the airport to buy another ticket they send wrong information to airline company . My advice stay away from this app.
 If you red my review and  book flight with this app don’t expect any refund  after you get problems | I love the service I get with Priceline. | I love Priceline. They always treat me good. | I’ve been using Priceline for couple years now and I love it. It’s very easy to follow along with your itinerary and as a vip gold I get pretty good deals. Also my hotel rooms are very cheap compared to others payment for the same room. The more you use it the cheaper it gets!",4.82035,967272,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/f4/dd/39/f4dd397b-5e60-1882-cda5-be382aa9e5a3/80e08117-6871-42ab-9589-770bf81ecada_5.5_Inch_IOS_Hotel_JAN24.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/c5/13/8c/c5138cbf-cf7a-86bf-41ae-cc9474cc8799/233517c1-001c-4d9b-8a7c-9736884867a8_5.5_Inch_IOS_RC_JAN24.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/cb/e7/31/cbe731c5-1e8a-702d-dbbd-02919bca279d/4e757c6f-9af9-42bb-8701-5b86fda65c95_5.5_Inch_IOS_FLIGHT_FEB24.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/cb/d8/3c/cbd83c25-f99e-550e-2e58-8270843619bf/b8820f9d-7a43-4107-a471-51d0b3559224_07-5.5_Inch_IOS_Flight4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/99/dc/e4/99dce401-038c-b480-0260-11c3a5107d8a/66fef252-5d93-4c4c-942e-d1ff635437cf_5.5_Inch_IOS_MYTRIP_JAN24.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/c6/68/33/c6683376-0e87-42fe-5228-b02377e2fee6/00f5a7bb-be14-4709-9ea3-21d5f8ea85ee_5.5_Inch_IOS_VIP_JAN24.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/70/c2/18/70c218fa-834a-d5a5-884b-7c7fe809c591/81ac9a19-783f-4ca0-b63e-eea9727c0cc6_5.5_Inch_IOS_RC5-_NEW_April_2023.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/66/77/f9/6677f905-ab16-5132-427a-fb4c8d06628a/05157a47-acfd-423b-aa75-c06e4de45abc_08-5.5_Inch_IOS_RC7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/bd/72/37/bd723796-a462-dd3e-c8e2-dbb0370e9f64/fa7f8bfa-92da-4c73-a044-2fd9492c00aa_ipad_hotels_2048x2732.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/63/2a/53/632a537a-dd99-d239-8546-2cb8283e211f/f8ca56c5-e48e-4ec9-a5ce-b127de88542d_ipad_Rental_Cars_2048x2732__U00281_U0029.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/68/a0/c5/68a0c59d-9dd2-47df-6cf8-587c4537e41e/46929947-687c-493a-bb82-938e1540bfdf_ipad_Flights_2048x2732.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/30/6b/b2/306bb23f-ed9d-8341-ff46-bb31c1f8c02e/17f1c720-fefb-4343-9f43-5915aaea6247_ipad_Trip_Details_2048x2732.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/f5/14/61/f514612d-c04f-8071-8f84-5efc4ad89791/81fc47cd-a720-49db-9582-834f79692947_ipad_Road_Trip_2048x2732__U00281_U0029.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iP

Thank you for reading and hopefully these will come on the next update. | I don’t understand how this is so highly rated it is so ridiculously expensive there’s nothing free about it and no reason to pay for something when you can’t even tell if it works | Excellent | I didn't even download this application, for some unknown reason, a weekly subscription appeared in my settings, which for some reason took $6 from my card every DAY, return my money, scammers!!!!! | Muy útil y necesaria la aplicación | Easy to use and the searching for flights is well optimized. 

It’s really annoying to have ads in an app like this, but they have to monetize it somehow. | Since United’s  777-300er became my favorite plane I used this app to track flights and it is helping me a lot now | Annoying, asks for subscription for a simple check | The app assist in keeping those picking up their loved ones informed to the location of the incoming flight. | Released an Apple Watch app, NEVER SUPPORTED IT BUT LIED THAT IT WOULD BE  SUPPORTED!!!!! And this app supposedly wins awards. AWESOME | Is the best. No more circling the airport real time take off and landings!! | Best app | Reassurance re flight times depart and arrival | Very helpful when I p/u family member from SNA | Con esta aplicación no pierdo tiempo esperando en el aeropuerto porque sé exactamente cuando salen y cuando llegan los vuelos, si está atrasado y por cuánto tiempo, mejor imposible. | Is getting less useful all the time. I use this app to track arriving flights for people I’m going to meet at the airport. But needless notifications days in advance are nothing but an annoyance.  Ads run each time after a flight is added to be tracked, which is fine and assumed on the free version. The problem comes when the ads  are obvious scams. And lately, the ads have been so long that you have to just shut the app down and reopen it if you want to continue. | Flight Tracker is very precise in tracking all flights including their departures, enroute and arrivals | Like this app. It’s got everything I want with flight schedules and radar views | The last few flights I tracked this app was way off & take off & landing times. As I write this my daughter is sitting on the ru way at Tampa 14th in line to take off. App says it took off 45 min ago. FIX THIS PLZ! | I found my flight in under 10 minutes | I just can’t make it work for Ethiopian airlines specially the local ones it doesn’t track it at all | Love how it keeps us updated and the small details such as baggage claim numbers | Even though I had to pay for no ads and live tracking, it is very accurate! I'm going to Vegas and I had a layover. I put my flight number and it was 100% accurate. Best flight tracker I've ever used! | I do not like this app and want to cancel it. 
Thank you | Tech support was very responsive, and corrected the issues in a timely manner. Flights are easy to search, and display the correct dates. Departure and Arrival times appear to be updated quickly and accurately. I’m very satisfied with this app! ——————————————————————— I subscribe to the Pro version of this app, which used to work well. As of at least yesterday, 1/21/2024, every search for an an Alaska Airlines flight results in “No Flights Found.” I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, with no change. Like much of the nation, we’re under very nasty weather conditions, so I was hoping this app would keep me advised of flight status. Time to look elsewhere. | Flight Tracker is a wonderful app and I use it all the time for business and personal travel. 

However, before the app will ADD a flight to my calendar, it wants full access to my calendar. A flight app should be able to add a flight to a calendar without full access to my private, daily schedule. I should be able to select the option, “add events only” without impacting my privacy. Thank you. | Super | I love this application | I’ve never written a negative review. I’m of the opinion if you don’t like something don’t use it an move on. This app pushed me to my breaking point. 
I’ve used this app for several years. Loved the ease of use and accuracy. However, since I don’t travel a ton the only paid option at 50.00/year doesn’t make sense to me. The ads last about a minute each and you need to watch one or two between adding any new information. This is particularly aggravating while your literally at an airport and trying to get information quickly. Sadly, I’m going to search for a new app as it’s become incredibly frustrating and unfun to use. | Have used this app for many years. The new version is horrible. I finally deleted it; it is useless to me. | I just paid for real-time tracking. It told me the flight had already taken off and showed the plane over the water on the map. Then I got a text from our son saying they were still in the runway and there was a maintenance issue. 
Really misleading and dishonest app. | Within five minutes my screen was taken over with a full page ad to ‘free up space’ … and I could not figure out how to get rid of it. No ‘x’ to hit. Only an opportunity to free up space. So I got out and deleted the app. | Flight Tracker reported that my sons plane left on time at 12:45. It’s 2:50 and plane is still at gate delayed over 2 hrs. So much for updates. | No flights are shown after the last update two years ago. Before this update the app sas 👍👍👍👍. So please fix the issue please. | App stopped tracking flights two days ago. Getting little help from customer service. Was using paid app version. Very frustrating. | Amazing app helps tracking and getting stuff together also you know what time everything is | Very useful app highly recommended | Stop showing flights | Interface is far worse than Flightaware. No ability to find where your jet is currently. Dumped it | Flight Tracker is amazing and so accurate!! | When you only fly once or twice a year and annoying. | Everything gets monetized.
Gone from my apps. | I've been using the Flight Tracker app for years now, and it's been great. It's reliable, easy to use, and has some really useful features. The TripIt integration is a game changer. Overall, I have no complaints – this is a must-have for those who fly a lot. | I never seen any of us before and now I have now because you’re tracking were so good that I literally just saw an airbus A380 and it was so cool and huge. Your tracking told me where it was and where it was located. | This application is not compatible with the new iPhone. The middle screen freezes and doesn’t go away until you uninstall. | NOBLESVILLE Indianapolis | This one is the only flight tracker that doesn’t glitch or is behind in anyway. My favorite thing is the map of each airport! Such a useful tool. If I could make a recommendation for a better app then I would have to say that if they included the map of where the baggage will be, how to get there from the arrival location and a map of where the terminal is or where the location is after baggage claim, then I will have to pay for the premium account definitely. Otherwise, the price for premium doesn’t seem worth it since the free version has everything I needed. Also, I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because the app kills my battery if I forget to close it so they should probably make it force close upon exit to fix that, the flight will still be in the recent section for easy access. | Would not recommend this app.! | I had used the app in the past and liked it. But without paying for a premium membership it’s barely useable now. Way too many ads now. | This app drained 61% of my battery within 8mins of on-screen activity. Either badly programmed or they’re scrapping

This app is almost useless - I’d suggest you try some other one unless you want to buy the paid version. | I’ve had this app for years. Enjoyed using it occasionally when I wanted to see what plane was flying overhead. Now there is no way to get out of the opening screen without buying a subscription or a free trial, which of course is not free. Don’t mind ads, but I have no need for a subscription to this kind of an app. If I flew a lot, maybe. Will have to delete now. Too bad. I always enjoy looking up. | Suddenly planes are nowhere to be found.  Or planes are “frozen” .  It used to work great, not anymore. | New edition is pricey, no chance to use limited version for free, but the worth part is - it doesn’t work. I started trial period, can’t use, not working | I had to delete the app and reinstall it and when I did it is only giving me the option to purchase.  There is no “x” at the top to bypass and when I click on enable trial it is only good for a week I guess its time to look for another free app to use I really liked this one but will not pay to use it | I hate this app. 👎👎 After I updated, I lose all my data. | No planes appear when i open the app I’ve had this app for over a year and simply wont work now. | $39 to $89 is not acceptable.  Will not renew. | برنامج مفيد وضروري | Worthless..
 have to force it to update | If you try their “free” trial period & it falls over the end of the month, you will end up being charged the monthly fee even though the trial is not up. Be careful, not as advertised. | This app is wonderful and has so much easy features and accurate but after a while I starts to freeze and can’t types and other stuff I don’t know if it’s a bug or just my phone but it’s kinda anoying but overall it’s a worth it app and simple directions how to use it great job making this app it perfectly made but I don’t know about the bug so yea. | Not great. | Planes live used to be great probably the best… until they added ads and pro. | This app after you get it for free will start charging you $12.99 per month. Don’t fall for it. | Very easy to track flight | Love this app , watching the planes move around . Kids are always asking dad  for my phone . | Spend more time viewing junk adds. Supposedly saved 4 flights, but can’t view them. Makes me go through the process again, and again, and again. I suppose if I subscribed to paying $40/year they might give me more to review. But if their free trial is any indication, it would be something of neverending frustration | The most accurate flight info I’ve ever seen | This app has so many adds. Either you pay to get rid of the adds or you just stop using it. Horrible concept…to get paid. Considering alternative ways to get customers to pay. | Try Flight Aware better and free. | Misleading app, hard to use with out subscription | I’m loving being able to keep up with my children’s flight in their small plane. | Great app, but can you add a night mode. The white bright screen is annoying at night. | Great how it’s integrated with the airlines and gives accurate info in real time. Love it so far! | App of limited value outside continental US. | It’s an amazing app because it tells you when the planes are moving at what speed and altitude and I just got it to track my sisters flight but WOW!!! | It’s amazing how accurate it is. I see the plane on the map then go outside and it’s right there. Super cool app | It does cost money but you can press x to get out and you get to see planes round the world and it showes it like a gps would that makes it easy for you to go to places and you can go to airport and you can see planes around you. | Recently, searching for a flight or an airport is not returning results, showing an error message. | I just used this app for first time AND each time I try to type in a flight number or airport, nothing shows up, search just spins. So frustrating!!!! | To many add | Have been trying to cancel this for 2 months and they keep charging me. | This feels like a game to me and how much money do you actually have to spend on seats? | Love this app. | This is just a ripoff of flight radar 24 and this is the worst version of that | I cannot locate the flight of my loved ones like you promised!! | As soon as you give them your email which there is no way around it they immediately want you to subscribe. I’m guessing I will get a bunch of spam like always when you give out your email. I deleted app because of better options out there that are better and cheaper | I can follow my family flying!! Awesome ! ETA  and other things … have too many informations ! | I’m trying to find a please note the next day and the prints or not there. Hope they consist of this soon😀 | I use this app to keep me current on family travels - makes coordinating transportation so much more efficient. Very easy to use - intuitive. Good stuff! | Recommend it. | تكلفة التطبيق مرتفعة جدا | I was trying to track one of my family members flights to see when they would get there and it was going good at first till it showed me that THE PLANE WENT BACKWARDS. I was confused because there was no information or email that told me that the flight was going back. So I decided to go download a BETTER app that told me the their flight was on track and not back at where it started. Based on the other reviews I have seen Im sure the company did this for money because everyone I try to open the app it showed me an add. 1/5 stars This app will never be on my phone. Thank you. | I like the app, but I can’t give it 5 stars cause it’s a pay app | Its the best i have ever used | This app will only work for free for 3 days if you subscribe, you have to remember to cancel before the 3 days is up or you are automatically billed.

Update: The developers fixed the bug and the app works now, nice job! | Seems I’m always checking out planes in the air. | My go to APP when checking on flight status, weather conditions, airport delays etc. | Love this app, it provides such details regarding flight information | Can’t find “where’s my plane now?” | I can’t get it to load, I’ve tried deleting it and reinstalling it but still nothing | It’s a little confusing and sometimes it doesn’t recognize flight numbers. | Gracias. Me encanta flightaware | Searching for a specific flight in the future only shows those within 48 hours. It would be nice if I could see all scheduled flights within a week, not just 48 hours ahead. | I was about to look at my grandpas flight and it just it was just spinning. If you can fix it please reach out to me. | Doesn't work.. can't do alot of things promised.. my biggie... can not put in a date | Can’t get the alerts to work n now app isn’t working | And won’t go back up. | Love the tracking from start to finish. Well done. Thanks | While it lagged in time I still enjoyed using it to follow my family across the skies to their destination. 
Love it!!!! ❤️✈️ | More info was available before recent update. Previously could see boarding time and whether boarding had started but now the emphasis seems to be on showing other flights going in or out of airports on both ends of flight which is only useful for cancellations | I found this app to be at Times very confusing. I keep on going back to the other app I have, FlightView. | This is the most difficult app—it’s absolutely horrible! I have to go to google to find anything. | Downloaded the app during my flight when I realized that United uses Flightaware in their app. But it won’t run, just a spinning wheel. Deleted and reinstalled, same thing! I give up… | Not user friendly. Difficult to navigate the site. Confusing! Not worth the money at all! | I’ve used Flight Aware before on google and I finally got the app. But then the app would not work it just kept loading and loading over and over again. Someone please fix this. Flight Aware more like flight nowhere. | Way better than a reader board in an airport!
Accurate up to date info that will keep you moving! | Very very exemplary every moment trucker | The app doesn’t alert you when you set the notification bell for reminders. What is the point? Isn’t that the entire reason to use it? I don’t get it. It was set to alert me 45 min before landing, now it’s 22 min before landing and no alert… delete. | Your app is as accurate as can be. | I have marveled at the technology, design power,  grace and travels of airlines along with the skills, training and dedication of crews who carry many souls or sometimes precious cargo.  The daily activity in the skies using Flight Aware  allows me to imagine the crews, passengers, and cargo that show we are a people engaged in the world and it’s people. | When family travels peace of mind! | Thank you FlightAware for putting the flight data back to the old style! Much better | Fast, accurate & clean. | Unfortunately, your ADS readings concerning speed, climb and altitude are all wrong. I suggest you do two things. The first is that you correct whatever errors are in your software program that's corrupting the information we're getting and the second is to report speed in knots, not miles per hour. Right now, I could not give your app a really good rating like I would like to. | It literally blows the average person’s mind when I point at an aircraft flying overhead and inform them of the flight’s details! lol | I love the app and the fact that I can track my loved ones while on a flight, so I know when to pick them up. However the app doesn’t send out notifications like it says. I have them set for the “45 minute out” alert,  it not one alert has come through. I have checked the settings and everything is set to allow it to send notifications, but I have never gotten one. 🫤 so yay for tracking, but nay for notifications. | Not only does this app. serve as my defacto RADAR but is also used in conjunction with othe apps to provide radio communications (receive only) and weather radar apps provide airport diagrams, frequencies and real time weather. I can pinpoint storms arrivals to within five minutes of arrival at my location. The ADS-B this app depicts, is useful often all the way through the turn off the runway after landing. Fabulous ! | There is no way to remove that box with altitude etc and it blocks the flight path. Pleeeeease remove that box. I’m talking about the pop up box that follows the plane. I love this app! | Undo last update. Can’t find airport on map. Total waste of time. Looking for different app for my needs | Starts up, no aircraft appear. 

I need to change views, then return to the start up view to see aircraft. But then the map displays the South Pacific…!! 

The display is lagging way behind real time. 

There is a control to view my flight feeder (I have one from the company) but when I select the control I’m taken to a web page, not my flight feeder’s data…!!! 

There are many other intermittent anomalies; there are spurious failures, crashes and hangs. 

Disappointing. And I have the enterprise version and use the app while logged in to my account. | As MANY others have said the latest update is trash. Missing features that we enjoyed just a month ago. Lame. Bring back the old version and ALL the features or after SEVERAL YEARS I’ll be switching | Really like this app.  It’s good to track friends when meeting up at a fly-in.  I can also look up my plane and check out all the different perimeters of the flight.  Great job guys, you knocked it out of the park with this one. | I use the app to understand what is happening with the police helicopters. The big gray box obscures the flight path.  Please remove it! | When using classic background especially, nearby flights are muted ,hard to see | We are at the airport waiting for a flight but the app won’t let me check todays flight. Only tomorrow. Will delete app asap. | The update that now has a large box with flight info often obscures the flight path and other important map information. Please go back to the old way or at least give us an option to toggle it on/off.

App is fine otherwise. | The iPad version doesn’t seem to work at all on the Apple Vision Pro | Sometimes a new software update is a step backwards. The latest version occasionally freezes. Sometimes it freezes for a couple of minutes and occasionally the app must be closed and restarted.

When you tap on an airport like SFO all the other flights in the area disappear for a while.  The previous version of the software worked better.   

Can we roll back to the previous software version.    Don’t fix the software if it ain’t broken | Latest “update” took away the “where is my jet now” feature. The single most important feature to track whether or not your flight will be on time or not.

Wish it could have landmarks/points of interest highlighted on the map. | By far the most accurate app for navigation that I’ve used both in London and New York. | Do not trust! Apple Maps is better | Works. No Dark Mode. Still?? | I didn’t know what to expect, but this app is essential for getting around in London | First time overseas and was recommended this app through multiple YouTube channels and they were right.  Public transport was my biggest worry and this app made it simple. | This app saved my life and made me feel confident in traveling around town. I would recommend this to everyone | There used to be an active compass widget that you could add. This was so useful! Please bring it back 🙏 | Love it!!!! | My favorite thing about this app is that it has an option to select a quieter biking path! Love that. My biggest concern is that it automatically tells you how many calories that would be burned by walking or biking a certain route. I tried to turn this off in settings, but I don’t see that as an option.

The calorie count should be removed. It is…
- Misleading. Calorie burning is different for everybody, and these numbers are more inaccurate than anything else.
- Harmful. A lot of people in modern-day culture have a very fraught relationship with the concept of calories in food, a concept which has largely been used for fear-mongering and marketing. It is harmful to be confronted with this rhetoric in a transportation app.
- Not physically meaningful. The number of calories in a food is how much energy will be released if you set it on fire. That is not what is happening in a body during metabolism. | Used the app a few years ago when in Tokyo and it was fantastic. This recent trip, not so much. Relied on Google maps for transit directions with excellent results. Citymapper routes took long with more connections and lots more walking compared to Google maps. Some lines missing completely on Citymapper. Not sure what has happened. | City mapper needs to figure out why their app doesn’t stop when the user repeatedly closes the application at the destination. Very annoying. Otherwise the app is perfect. | I just downloaded the app and I’m trying to figure out navigation in a different part of the country. When I type in the address of my final destination, before I can even enter in my starting address- the app seems to be taking my current location (which is on the opposite side of the country from the final destination), and it keeps crashing and exiting me out. I’m unable to use this app. Please fix this, thanks! | Thank you for not getting us loss. 

We were impressed! | This is what the Parisians use because it is better and more reliable. Americans use Google Maps and it is less accurate. It didn’t note a major closure for months. Use this one. | Wrong bus times the whole day…. C’mon now | I just started using this app for the NYC subway and I have to give it to the developers, the use of the Dynamic Island is amazing. It shows me the time for the next train I need to take at the top of the screen and even a handy feature where you can see the best place of the train to board so that you will be near your exit. Not only this the app also gives detailed directions for walking and I find it extremely easy to use. | Changed my whole trip. So easy to use. London, Paris, any city. | In summary, Citymapper is an excellent choice for urban navigation, especially if you rely heavily on public transport or need detailed walking directions. Give it a try and see if it suits your needs. I suggest everyone should download it | This is an essential app or anyone visiting London or any other well known city. Lots of different cities mapped out in app. | App is good and accurate with timing of the trains. My only gripe is that it doesn’t always let you know if the train is an express or local. It just defaults to local trains. Can be stressful if you need to catch an express train but end up on a local train. Besides that it’s good. | I use this app all the time. It's better than the MTA app. | App shows you various routes, cost and time.  While using a selected route, even has real time updates and reminds you to get off trains at stops etc. | Dark mode. It’s been out for years idk why it’s not native. | Easy to use and clear information on how many stations left to to your destination | I used to use this app all the time when I was living in NYC, it was the best. But I’ve since moved to Florence, Italy, and it’s been very disappointing. It seems to rely on the scheduled bus times instead of the live ones. In this town, the bus schedules are completely meaningless and only the live times are reliable. If the app is using live times, then they’re not using the right ones - it’s always wrong, while the official bus app has reliable live times. Also, buses here are very frequently diverted and that’s never noted in the app. Even worse, the app has quite a few of the bus routes completely wrong, even when there are no diversions. It’s a shame, because I love the app… but all this adds up to it being completely unusable here. Unfortunately, I’m deleting it. | So much better than using google maps. If you get stressed about which platform, which train, which exit...then this is the app. | I live in NYC and this is my main form of transit help. It’s easy to use. You add your home address, work, and favorite place to find a route with a click of a button.

The only issue is that sometimes it gets train arrival times incorrect. In my case, the 7 train never has correct arrival times. For some reason, around midday (mostly around 1:40) at least, it says that the 7 train is going to arrive at my designated station starting 3 pm. 

I have to google maps so I can get on the 7 train, which is twice a week I have to do this. 

Pls fix! | Sometimes the location on what part of the train to enter be inaccurate | Ok Wow this app puts google maps to absolute shame. I’m a New Yorker who prefers to take the bus when I can (sunlight + cell service!) but NYC bus schedules can be notoriously unreliable depending on traffic, weather, politics of the week. This app has VERY impressive real-time tracking of trains and busses. I haven’t waited 15 minutes for a train or bus in months now because I check this long before I do google maps. THANK YOU | App no longer works— won’t let me change departure location. When I try the screen goes black and the app crashes. I updated it and the same thing happens. | So baffled… did anybody ask for this??? | Can’t believe what a wonderful and efficient APP this is!👍😊
It works perfect and took me all around the city I was in. | Love Citymapper especially the “best doors” features. I can stay out of everyone’s way, deal with public transit snafus with ease, and get where I want to go without unnecessary hassle. | App works great for getting around the city. Only thing that would make it better is allowing me to out multiple stops in and the solving for the best way to do them all. | It was priceless. Helped with the, bus, walking and biking. | Used to be Moovit // I even coined the tagline // CityMapper FTW | I was on a trip to England and I was lost and I relented my you guide recommended me this app. And I haven’t not used for since then | Great App | I live and travel all over the place, and Citymapper has been the most reliable navigation app I’ve used. Others are fine as well, but I really like their interface, the clean layout showing all the options (walking, transit, cars, etc), and - living mostly in Paris - especially the alerts re service outages in various transit lines. It’s reliable, works in most major cities (I have used it extensively in Paris, London, and LA personally), and even the free version (with minor footer ads, not obtrusive to the usability) is great. Big fan. | I wish there was a widget or a live activity for a specific station without the entire transit navigation to keep an eye on a specific bus in a specific bus stop. If one is missed the other is shown. This would really help in catching the next bus. | I downloaded this app after coming across a recommendation, but it’s been a letdown. The app crashes every time I try to start a trip, despite my software being up-to-date and attempting a restart. Unfortunately, Citymapper is unusable at worst and unreliable and buggy at best. | I downloaded and tried Citymapper on a recent trip to Spain. Incredible experience! I quickly found myself preferring Citymapper over other major map apps. I even found it more reliable walking, but the transit options were terrific. Fantastic experience! | Works great in NYC, train times are accurate and offers far more routing choices than google/apple. Goes above and beyond with info about subway exits and Citi bike stations. Unbelievably, it’s free. Not for place search, but Citymapper is in a class of its own for getting from point to point. | Wow!

I’m surprised as it has been opened for almost 2 years now. | I found myself coming back to this app again and again despite also having the TfL app. This one is much more intuitive and I love the clean interface. It gives multiple options for connecting which is helpful if one line requires you to wait, or you need a specific line with multiple stops for different people. The offline options are especially helpful when on the underground as there’s no cell service. | Soon as I opened the app an ad popped up! Nope deleted right away | I would honestly pay to buy this app if the ads weren’t as obnoxious as they are in the free version.   I mean, lock out some features to make people want to upgrade, don’t bombard them  with obnoxious ads every 20 seconds. | The amount of ads is awful in case you don’t pay for their fee. Terrible user experience | I went to London for a trip and this was a life saver | Love it and sharing with stepdaughter - on her way to London | Used the free version on a recent visit to London.  The Tube moves a lot of busy people and is often crowded. Just when you need it to decide which lines to get you where you want to be, and trying not to impede polite but busy people, you’ll get an ad. And not just a quick ad you can x out of, but one that forces you to endure for way too long.  If you want to plan in advance, use CitiMapper, which includes more options to get you around by foot, train or bus. If you just need to navigate the Tube, you will find wall maps through out the stations, and they also provide free paper overviews of the entire system.  I understand ads support free apps, but these make the app unusable on the fly. | This is useless. Every tap redirects to ads which have  a fake x button. Rubish | I am getting a pestering array of Ads every so many times I use the free version.  These adds are not a typical banner at the bottom but are quite intrusive and disruptive. I used in 2019 to visit London in the same fashion but didn’t experience this Ads onslaught.  I get the impression the developer is wants users so annoyed to buy the premium service. I am only visiting for 5 days!!  Com’on developer, be a little nicer!!!! | This app surreptitiously installs a Safari extension called “ Shop & Save” that can read and alter webpages and browsing history — this is listed nowhere in the app description or during installation or during runtime. | I used this app six years ago and found it invaluable. Unlike many apps, this let you plan the route long before arrival in London. Many apps require you to already be there. However, to use the app now requires the user to submit to very annoying game ads. The ads run for a long time and even then the user can’t get off the ad and back to the app. TOTALLY USELESS!!! So after six years, I am deleting this app. What a relief! | I tried this APP on my  recent trip to London. What a waste of timeline. This App is confusing and counterintuitive. It is also REDUNDANT, because the regular maps app on your phone already does a far superior job. Just put in where you want to go in London, select “Transit”, and it does a 50x job. It will guide you through what platforms and stops you need and even keeps you apprised o mr arrival times.

Don’t bother with this garbage app. | If you like looking at ads and missing your train this is the app for you | Used this last week. If you can deal with the continuous ads it’s a good app. Missed some connections because we had to wait for all the ads to stop running. Never had an app that showed so many ads. Here is an idea to the developers, come up with a short term pricing plan like a week or two so we can get these stupid f-ing ads turned off and can make our connections!!!!! | Great app. Really made my trip to London easy to use the tube. Love that I can plan a route and save it. | Lots of ads, unclear map, and wants you to subscribe to a yearly service. Get real. | For a casual traveler, not wanting the paid version, there are just too many 30 second adds. Citymapper is much better. | This is just adware, it doesn’t show the map long enough to use it. Why would anyone use this when there is literally a free official app. | Terrible app—one of the worst metro map apps of any city in the world.  Absolutely choked with ads rendering it basically useless. | Just got back from our first trip to London and using this app made getting around London to see the sights via the tube so much easier. 
It can show you the nearest tube station to your location and all you do it put in the location of the station you will be starting from and where you want to go and it does the rest. Gives you what t train to take and tells you what stop to get off. If you have to switch trains, it tells you the stop you get off ti switch the train and the next train to take and what stop for your final destination. 
This was great and the tube is so nice to use to travel around London. Highly recommended to anyone going there and planning ti use the tube. Much, much less expensive than a taxi. | Every time I try to use this app it takes me to some new advertisement. Practically unusable. | 30 second ads every 30 seconds makes app unusable. Use the National Rail Enquiry app. That’s the app the rail workers use. | Used it for many years but recently it became unusable as ads are non stop and take forever! On top all of them trick you when you try closing them. Deleting now. Enough is enough | I loaded this app on my phone prior to a trip to London. And trying to search out various routes pop up ads come up right and left and make it impossible to even use the application. Would not recommend this at all. Looking for another alternative. | Live thevtube | I can’t get rid of it | Pop up adds are horrible. This used to be a good app. | My dreamy London and its comfortable …. | If you don’t subscribe to the ad free version, once an ad loads you can’t get back to the map. Extremely annoying | I’ve used this app for years.  I paid for no ads and extra features. Now the developer is wanting users to pay for an annual subscription. It offers me a “one time offer” for $9.99/year. I feel like if I’ve already paid for the app, I shouldn’t be held up for a subscription, and I have no intention of paying more. TFL has a great journey planner for free. | Unless you purchase the app don’t waste your time. It’s nearly impossible to use it before the screen is replaced by an ad probably every 15 seconds max. | I’ve been using the free version of this app while I’ve been here in London for the past week and can say without reservation that it has worked well without issues. It’s well worth your time and effort to install if you need a guide for the London tube system. | Everyone was very helpful and it was smooth sailing!! | Inaccurate for trip planning. Example: West Hampstead has three stations: Jubilee Line, Thameslink and Overground. Only the Jubilee Line is on this map. The Elizabeth Line isn’t shown either, although if you search on it, there’s a very detailed description. | Don’t like the pop up ads for diapers | The ads pop up just as you are starting to find what you are looking for and are incredibly intrusive. They also freeze the app. | The Elizabeth Line opened today after years (and years) of postponement. It’s not as if this app didn’t have sufficient notice. And yet, this line is nowhere to be found in their map or their line statuses. But there are various update history over the last several weeks with the app patting itself on the back for trying hard to be better. I have two words of wisdom for them: try harder. | As a tourist, I find the app difficult to use. The trip planner is great because it helps you figure out what lines to use. It does not however give you enough information to figure out if you were going north south east west, nor does it help you figure out The final destination which is how all of the trains are labeled. So it’s not quick and easy it requires you to try to find a map try to understand what the final destination is then try to find the train then try to find the list so you understand if you hit the final destination all of which you could do without the app which makes the app almost useless. | Sometimes Google Maps is better for route planning. Sometimes this app is better. I use both and compare. | Easy to use. Study it before you go and you’re a pro. Mind the gap! | Have been using this app on and off for ages, was brilliant. Now, it has so many pop up ads, it's unusable. 

No, I'm not paying a ridiculous annual price when there are free options available. 

Uninstalled. | The map of the London Underground is the best I have seen. Well worth getting. | Great app | Too many ads, especially back to back to back ads. Very annoying | Used to be a great App. I don’t mind paying the fee, but yearly?! Ads are horrendous | The free version has awful full screen ads that work disappear. | Works well. Can’t complain. | As soon as you bring up the app, ads display with no way to delete them.  You are better off bringing a paper TFL map when in London. | So many adverts keep popping up.

I’ve been choosing TURO since 02/2023, which is when I was introduced to the Car Rental Service. With TURO it’s going to be as smooth as you allow it. Finding a car in any area is too simple. Getting in contact with your host is simple. Everything is done strictly on the app. No Deposit needed. TURO now allows you to reserve a vehicle for 0.00 down. You pay in full on the day that’s assigned or if you pay in full on the same day of booking it’s a done deal. The app will then advise you when check in is and departure date. The app allows you to take and save multiple pictures of the car upon arrival and departure. And of course during this time and throughout the booking you’ll have full contact with your host if their are questions or concerns about the vehicle. Customer Service over the phone is awesome. TURO is very confidential so write down those password or email. It’s important but TURO has you covered with their awesome customer service agents ready to assist with any issue. Do your due diligence as a customer by looking at reviews and making sure your choosing correct dates and time for the trip also reading cancellation policy, guide lines and important information you’ll be good to go. This is why I don’t leave reviews I spill it all ahah. Overall 10/10 or 5/5 BOOK WITH TURO! | Seems like every few days there is another update to the app. This is very aggravating as it takes considerable time to process these updates. Your tech team need to evaluate each update change more thoroughly so they don’t have to send out frequent updates to fix problems in last version. This is still going on. Five updates in the last eight days. Rediculou. | Awesome was easy to start and simple to receive payments | I have rented twice now on the Turo app. The app is easy to use. Everything is straightforward and clear. And the renters have been very nice accommodating and very easy to work with! | So far so good using this app pretty intensely past few months. | Turo is by far the best way to rent a car. The app lets you do very specific searches to find just the right vehicle for your needs.
I’ll never rent any other way again.
Awesome service! | ZERO STARS PLEASE JUST GO TO AN ACTUAL RENTAL COMPANY

‼️TURO HAS NEWS REPORTS AND FORUMS
ON THIS EXACT FORM OF SCAMMING!!!!!‼️

I wish I would’ve listened but I tried to see for myself!!!😞I used TURO for the FIRST AND LAST time this month. PLEASE DONT USE THIS APP!!!!!!
Everything was great at first I even turned the car back in better than I received it, left the guy a great review and went so far to make sure I took OUTSTANDING care of the car for the 3 days I had it. FAST-FORWARD 4 DAYS LATER,  4 FREAKING DAYS LATER 😡!!!!

I get hit with a $165 SMOKING FEE!!!! Host sent pics of “ash” taking in the dark with flash on BUT SOME PHOTOS WERE TAKEN DURING THE DAY(how did Turo NOT CATCH THAT) and then said (ONLY AFTER I ASK IF HE SMELT ANY SMELL) he says “smoking smells”🫤 THEN cigarettes after just repeating “smoking smells” when asked to be specific…‼️IVE NEVER SMOKED CIGARETTES IN MY LIFE‼️this was a blindside scam I took the issue to Turo WITH SUPPORTING EVIDENCE and they still sided with the scammer. At this point Turo has to be in on it like they get a cut or something THERE ARE SO MANY CASES OF THIS AND ALMOST ALL WERE SIDED WITH THE SCAMMER HOST 
 
 I’ve never smoked cigarettes in my life as stated above, hate the smell and image🤢 !!!!!!!Please do further research don’t end up scammed like me😡!!!!!!! | This app is the way to go for some side hustles specially if you have more than one vehicle thank you Turo!! | This app amazing best rental car app ever | Took good care of the car! | Would recommend this vehicle to anyone ! Last minute work trip made extremely seamless ! | Excelente | I’ve been using Turo for a long time. They are definitely my go to. | Best way to travel | Worth it!   Offer something for the experience and make it easy and effortless for both host and client. | Excellent experience so far | Good so far… | Completely unhelpful and unsatisfactory customer service. When I pointed out that a host had misrepresented his vehicle, the host became irate and threatening.  He sent menacing screenshots of my location after failing to disclose that he was tracking my movement and making other false, absurd accusations. So in the end, I paid $500 for a car rental, which didn’t have the features I wanted, and a stressful vacation based on the ongoing verbal abuse of a host. Turo did nothing to help the situation, and they actually let his verbal abuse of me stand on my profile, based on their “free speech policy.” Customer “representative “ did not understand English well enough to grasp the situation. I’ll only be renting from airport rentals in the future. | Waaaayyyyy better than Avis Budget Enterprise or any of those other places | Although I appreciate the fact that you offer a coverage of 40/60 percent, I believe it is excessive that I have to switch to a coverage of 25/75 percent. Furthermore, is it possible for you to include a dropping off option at TJ airport in the San Diego area? | I prefer renting vehicles on Turo compared to any other car rental agency. It’s the “Airbnb” of cars. I am also a host and thankful their is a platform such as Turo to help accommodate my hosting ability for my vehicles. I’d highly recommend this platform to anyone. | Great car, even better host! The directions provided to get to the shuttle from the airport couldn’t have been clearer. The vehicle was spotless and well cared for. It accommodated our party and bags well. I will definitely use the same host when visiting Denver! | I was overcharged $600 for a rental the host reports a chip in windshield, and a seat cover damage! Totally false! Will never use again | The best alternative to conventional rental cars | Love this app. | I am a long time customer to Turo I recommend anyone using them. The Tesla I rented was a wonderful experience not to fond of all the charging stops and over charge fees but all in all she was a great host who help me anytime I needed her . | Turo is an easy app to rent fun cars of regular people. Convenient and nice | Turo the way to go | Turo is very easy and makes it convenient for us to rent our car. We appreciate how it walks you through the steps to take to ensure safeness all around. Thank you so much!! Keep doing what your doing. | Me and my boyfriend went to Miami for a 4 day trip on February 1 and rented a nice bmw from a guy named Artem. My boyfriend payed every thing, even parking spots. Months after we get home artem texts my boyfriend and tried charging him 85$ for a parking ticket that we never had a ticket from in Miami. My boyfriend asked to see it so they send a picture and it clearly says that the charge was in January way before we even got to Miami. He finally realized his mistake after being persistent about it but we get left alone. That next morning my boyfriends card gets charged the ticket so he has to call the people from this app and they said an agent charged saying “they didn’t see the evidence” thank god he is getting it back but we are in a tight spot right now and needed it. Never rent a car from a guy named Artem on here, they were very rude and not very smart when it comes to checking tickets and times and then charge anyways. Never using this app again | They charge insurance on both ends

They probably should just reimburse small damages without any deductible since its so common with rentals

Guess we dont have a choice - turo is the only game out there

The app works great and the customer service is responsive 

95% percent of my guests have been good | I absolutely Love Turo ,it’s so convenient and i can always find a vehicle to fit any occasion. It’s the only way i will rent a car . | This app is awesome every vehicle I have rented has been on point | So far so great! | I love using Turo..The flexibility of choosing any type of vehicle you want at very reasonable prices is top tier.I have always rented from Enterprise until I fell in love with Turo❤️❤️❤️ | App is very user friendly. Really appreciate an app that is not difficult to use! Turo is the best! | Overall I have not had any major issues. I really enjoyed the luxury vehicles that I rented were exceptional. I give all of them a 5 star. 
Meco | Lotta customers are having a hard time booking vehicles and just get frustrated and go somewhere different to rent a car | I love Turo…when ever I need a rental car I always use Turo…cars are great, prices are straight forward…and you can rent cars that aren’t usually available for rent…it is part of the fun! | Forget about the traditional way of renting a vehicle. Turo app has been really a blessing of covience. | Awesome experience. | I’ve had great host and there is always a good selection. Turoing a Model 3 help me buy my current Model 3. Rivian is my next rental. Stoked to see what the hype is about. | I love using the Turo app platform. It has allowed me to several times rent vehicles at a much lower rate than I would from the airport rental places. I was able to get a much nicer car for a much better price. | Turo is consistent, easy to use, and very customer focused. It’s gives power to the drivers and car lenders; that’s why I continue to use them and recommend them to my friends. 

Thanks Turo, keep it up! 

Maybe some price cuts/affordability benefits now that you’re public? | We got Black’s 2020 Ford Expedition MAX. Easy instructions to pick up the car. When we first got the car it was a little dirty. No big thing, had little minor issues like the radio display not showing and he addressed our issues right away. The side steps at times wouldn’t come down but other than that it was a great car and great on gas. I would recommend this rental to a friend. Definitely would like to get the car again. | Smooth easy check in process
I prefer it to normal rental car agencies | Love Turo for personal use and business! | I think the app is ok and I look forward to learning more. Thank you! | Roger was great communicating gave clear instructions. everything was great! would def recommend! | Really helpful app.",4.78437,237814,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/53/5b/1f/535b1f4d-d621-d8eb-169f-8e0addef2224/1bd68860-8289-4c23-ad37-310dcf17e5d0_2401_app-store_5.5-1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2c/b4/0e/2cb40ee7-e774-ad34-0228-36b8901ddea4/d5751a0b-49c6-447c-a0f6-958580885353_2401_app-store_5.5-2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5d/3f/5f/5d3f5fa1-f19a-ba6f-6aa1-f05553099b18/8b170c68-9ac4-4da1-acce-2edca4365e97_2401_app-store_5.5-3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d9/b7/73/d9b773cb-a4af-ef0e-4397-d1c3f9f4a05d/4aa503c2-fb99-430f-a528-e5c9de0b08d0_2401_app-store_5.5-4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/18/c7/9e/18c79eea-fcfa-b4b2-2a49-ac73658c7e1c/c74f170e-6cac-4ba8-a3dd-9e70b18a8ac7_2401_app-store_5.5-5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/17/c9/5e/17c95e77-1660-5372-75f1-4bff0e21bf0e/0ca0bfc3-898e-4bc7-b7fc-05a48dd2dc96_2401_app-store_5.5-6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I don’t see Center City Philadelphia or just simply Philadelphia in general I don’t understand. | This app has a great concept for planning trips, however is very slow when searching destinations to add. | Very glitchy - takes a long time to load. Shows all results of things to do, after you put in the location, to places in completely different countries!! | The map feature only shows you the most recent 10 recommendations. To see them all I have to scroll and load each recommendation which takes FOREVER. And when I click into any recommendation, I lose my place and have to start over. So it’s virtually impossible for me to actually see all my recommendations laid out. So disappointing, I’ll have to just use google maps | Before you begin there is a short questionnaire which asks who you are traveling with. I put family and children, yet when I inserted my travel destination and had an itinerary generated, it recommended things that were not kid friendly.

Additionally, the questionnaire asks what your budget looks like. Although I chose the lowest bracket, it recommended five star restaurants that were completely unaffordable for me. 

There were a couple hidden gems in the recommendations, but overall it isn’t worth the space it would take up on my phone unless some more moms joined the community to beef up the kid and budget friendly recommendations. | Looking for a great planning tool that allows you to share with others in your group. This is the one, nice layout and many recommendations for your area of stay. | I could not for the life of me figure out how to see any reviews for places in a city. Whoever designed the ui for this app should be fired. | I want to live this app but it’s certainly glitching on me. I’m clicking on what I know is a restaurant I have saved in San Fran and it’s saying it’s a beach. | Great to find people who like what you like, so you can get a better idea of what you may like in new places.

I’ve added a bunch, and the location are off. For example, upstate NY is occasionally included in NYC and 2 of my Japanese restaurants in NYC are being listed as a cathedral location. | I love the concept of the app, but some features don’t work or don’t have a real purpose. It’s really hard to just search an area without looking at someone else’s list. When you search something and add it to a list, the UI just throws you back to a random place and you have to start your search over again. Needs some work on user experience, but I’ll keep using and hope bugs get fixed! | People use Apple Maps for the same use as an app like this. This is just a places finder. So no point and not recommended. | So excited to use this app! Look me up and share your travel tips! @bohemianspirit | I love this app—so helpful for planning trips! If I have one suggestions, it’s that I wish you could add comments/reminders to yourself when you add a place to a trip (e.g., what dish everyone loves at a restaurant). I think you can’t add notes like that when you’re planning, only once you’ve marked it as a recommendation. | I use OOO both for finding new restaurants and as a quasi-travel diary so when I go back to a city I can remember my own favorites! 

With fake reviews / AI seeming to be on the rise on other sites, it’s fantastic that OOO allows you to filter by reviews of people you know. | I love this app, but I think it’s going to take some updates and improvement before this app becomes trendy. Users should be able to categorize places manually because some of them are incorrect—e.g., it lists one of my hotels as something to “do” instead of as a place to stay—and there is no way to change it. I also saved a recommendation in Utah and it is showing up as a location in Michigan. But I would love to see this app grow and for more people to start using it, it has such awesome potential!! | You’re only able to make itineraries with limited items. I work really hard to find hidden gems so it doesn’t really make sense that I can make an itinerary using only the most popular spots | The best way to make the perfect itinerary for all your stops & trips 😍 | Love all the features so far, but how can I make a reservation as I don’t see how you do it using open table. Is a booking feature coming soon? | Not only is the brand name perfect. I love how the app is designed and it’s features. I can definitely see this app being a must have for travellers with a few extra features. 
I use it to plan my trips and save my must go to places. It’s been super handy! 

I would love to see a option on the trips section to share the itinerary via PDF. I can imagine it would look perfect to share with friends who don’t use the app or if you are planning a trip for a family member. 

Keep up the great work! I’m a super fan! Finally an app that not only is pretty but also super useful 🫶🏼 | I love this app. Just starting to use it and I am in love with the My trips part of it. Love being able to add places of interest with times for each day! The only thing is that some of the places I rec show incorrect info on my page. I recommended a place in Utah Wyoming and the final place on my place is showing Ann Arbor, MI. Another is showing incorrect town with a picture that had nothing to do with my review.  Also the feedback does not work on the app. Unable to send any feedback. | EDITS:
Would also love to see the ability to add a “manual” item- for example: hop-on, hop-off bus tours. Would be super helpful to leave a review and just save my pictures and notes from the experience for keepsakes.

This could easily be the next big social media craze, especially with travel coming back! I love the concept: plan and document all my trips in one place, with ability to recap them in the perfect mix of photos and written descriptions, WITH A SCHEDULE :) so I can easily pass down detailed plans. Amazing. BUT, there are definitely features missing before it can go viral… I’d love to see: - The ability to add photos to a place just for you/even if you don’t “rec” a place, so I don’t have to post personal pictures to the internet if I want to use it like a social network with a cute recap of me and my partner on a trips’ pictures for our friends and family. This would go along great with better privacy/sharing settings, so I can share my trips and photos and comments/notes with people, allow others to add comments who are tripmates and maybe a “view only” tier with public/private comments for what I want a friend to be able to see (if someone from work asks for trip recs, but maybe I don’t want them to see my reservation notes on a place but do want them to see my review). | As a travel agent, I LOVE using this app to build trips for my clients. Once all of your activities/hotels/restaurants are loaded, my clients are able to click on the itinerary and everything shows up on the map in their app, which saves them  TONS of time from having to Google everything individually outside the app. Super trendy, modern, and unique recs from all the users. Such a fun travel space to be in! | Amazing for travels recs and finding new places.  I’ve been sending lists of my recs for years and now this makes it so much easier to share with friends! | I hope more people use it, such a cool idea | A really awesome function that should be incorporated in to this beautiful app would be a visually appealing countdown feature for “My Trips”. A bonus would be the ability to create a Home Screen widget for your countdown as well! | So much potential. I got so excited for this app and to use it but has a few problems. This is my first ever review on here because guess what? Your feedback option does not work. You click on submit and does nothing. Do you guys not test your app after updates?
Also, does anybody who works for this app ever use it at all? If so, you can easily catch the glitches and what needs to be fixed. For example, when you click the “back” button, it doesn’t really go back to the previous page you’re on. When i am checking out another person’s profile, clicks on their recs, and then tries to go to back to their page, it doesn’t. It leads me back to my profile! It is so annoying. Please fix this. The app is way too focused on “aesthetic” but has no quality. Way too many problems. | I love this ap!! I love having lists for all my trips in one place, love the aesthetic, & the map feature ! 

I would LOVE to be able to make my own notes for businesses that only I can see. That way any research I’ve done on the place can be there too. For example- a place that doesn’t take reservations for breakfast, I’d like to note that :) | Love the look and design of this app, and the concept and information you get for trips is amazing!! Really helpful to create your own trip folders or wishlists all in one place with pictures, location etc etc. convenient and helpful to get you to all the places you’re wanting! 

The docked star is due to some interface annoyances through using the app. When clicking into someone’s recommendation from a trip and clicking the back arrow it brings you all the way back to the search page rather than that person’s trip to continue looking through their reccos. So you have to find your way back to where you were if you want to continue browsing. | Love this concept and the ease of use of the app. As a business owner, I wish there was a way we could edit information that isn’t correct, such as hours of operation. I understand the concept is for this to be different than Yelp, just wish we could provide accurate information. | This app is a beautiful way to plan trips and to remember past trips. | So helpful to see hometown recommendations! Love love love this app and can’t wait to see all the new features that get added 🙌🏽 | As someone who loves traveling and giving recs, this is perfect. Still needs some things worked out,   Like my profile picture and background photo do not load or show? probably a bug issue. Also I would love it if you were able to have a tab with a grid of all the photos you’ve took at locations, similar to Instagram, and the ability to change the main photo on your profile of trip locations. Otherwise great app can would love to see this grow | While I’m pretty proud of the state of my travel spreadsheets, this app blows them away. The social aspect, easily saving and sharing ideas with friends, make planning so much easier. | Pros:
+ GPS enabled search
+ Clean, intuitive functions
+ Collaborative space

Cons:
- does not map from location to location
- there’s no default view of a trip to show the entire itinerary, you have you click day by day 
- you can’t share trips to Instagram stories, there should be an attractive easy display for sharing on social media 
- there is no FAQ or feedback section in the app to suggest changes 
- you cannot make notes about a location or place you select for your trip, therefore I still prefer using notes over this app until it adds features

I am happy to use this app for an upcoming trip and will provide an updated review if the app features are updated. | I love this concept! The app is super easy to navigate and fun to use. I love logging all of the places I’ve been to, because it both helps give people I know recommendations, and it gives me a nice memory bank of where I’ve been. I used this to plan a recent trip, and it was such a neat way to keep track of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do. Love the map feature to see where in a city my friend’s recommendations are, and to find where my next stop is on vacation! | Love all the features so far. Genius idea!! When I’m planning trips, especially international trips, I use google maps to organize the itinerary based on location and proximity. I’m def gonna start inviting friends to join to make our lives easier. 
 For more effective itinerary planning, I would suggest adding the following:
1. Times
2. Option to add attachments, videos or images because some of the images don’t do these places justice)
3. Finally notes within scheduled places (as shown in the previews) and also notes to add activities that are not listed. 

I also love how the map shows the proximity of places to each other but is it possible to add a feature where we can see the actual distance from one place to another and perhaps driving directions? Currently, google maps only opens for directions to one place. | truly changes the game | Really great concept and I love the user friendliness. However, each time I try to see a list of someone’s recs on their page (or even my own), the recs do not load. The only way I can see recs is by searching a city right now. Needs an update probably

UPDATE: it works fine. This ^ was only happening for a few hours the first day. Really cool app! | Great for planning trips and sharing recommendations with friends! | It’s so awesome that you can put locations on the day you plan to visit but why not add time? It’s not a full function collaboration or trip planing tool if you can’t plan times in your day. | Cool app. Will definitely be using in future travels. Just wish there was an option to add your own photos and notes. Could possibly make this option private or public for others to see. | There are many things I love about this app. I just started using “plan my trip”.  
Not only am I adding all the places/ things I want to do as I prepare but this will also serve as a record for me for future,  Have u ever tried to remember that little restaurant you had stumbled across but couldn’t. Just park it here. | Love the app, such a great concept, very user friendly, and very great aesthetically. Just one thing- please make an update where you can make folders within each city of recommendations so that we can distinguish between food recs/activities/shopping, etc. Right now they are all in one category under each city and I’m afraid my recommendations will get lost in the sauce and get confusing if I keep adding to it! Would love a bit of organization and categories within each city. Thank you! | I’m already obsessed with the app as-is. It’s been. A very practical, helpful tool for trip research & planning - especially for group trips with friends or family. I don’t have a ton of friends on the app yet, so my planning process is still to go to Pinterest or travel blogs for ideas and then I save my wishlist things to do in Out of Office. If they keep building out additional features that make it more useful, building a user base I want to follow, and create more opportunities for engagement across users, this app will be an absolutely must have for anyone who enjoys a trip! | I love to see what friends and influencers that I follow are doing when they travel. Places to stay, eat, sights to see! I sometimes DM people and ask but this makes it so much easier especially when planning a trip and giving others recommendations. 10/10 recommend! | This is hands down one of the most beneficial travel apps I have ever used. For someone who loves to travel the reviews and recommendations have been spot on! Can’t wait to use the app on my next trip! | A user friendly interface that’s so easy to use! And because I trust my friends (and some influencers), it makes picking my hotel or restaurant so simple! Why didn’t someone think of this sooner?

I didn’t see it but having a map incorporated into the app for the visual reference would be nice.  Thanks. | I created a stellar account years ago. Didn't use it much but I remember thinking it was cool. I came back to try after seeing an ad online that made it look different. But I can't login using my old login (fb) without it saying my email is already associated. I'm clicking login, not create account. 

So I guess it just isn't meant to be. Sad. I had high hopes. | Love sharing all my fav travel moments in one place. The new trips feature is cool for planning trips or sharing trip itineraries with friends. | Hello. There is a bug with the current (11.2.1) version of the Stellar app for iOS. The app provides an option to use a Twitter/X login to create an account.

If the user backs out (cancels out) of the Twitter authorization login, the user will is sent back to an unresponsive Stellar app. The app freezes until it is manually restarted or deleted and then re-downloaded. This is very odd, as I have never seem this happen with any other iOS app. Canceling out of the Twitter authorization prompt is usually the first thing I do. I have never seen an iOS freeze the way the Steller app does.

My Twitter account of @RandomiOSBugs tagged the @StellerStories account online. Please investigate this issue, thanks.

P.S. the Steller app’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions links are not working on the Twitter authorization page either. | I used to love this app, I still do ….

Except for the inability to create stories, with more than one page.

The format was far better when first created .
It was much easier to use. 
Maybe it’s just me , but the changes make it harder to compose stories that allow for multiple pages as it used to.

Also . I was locked out of my original story page ,  for which support was never able to help , making it u organized and harder  
to create. | After falling out of love with so many social platforms, Steller give the experience feel without the pretentious vibes of some *cough* other platforms | This app was so easy to join and will definitely inspire you | Great for finding beautiful places to travel! | I'm
So disappointed that this app was so much better and easy to share to download plus easy to make stories before.  Now I'm confused again it's like the 3rd time changing your app. I can't share it on my social media etc. I'm very disappointed and sad about it. | Love the app. You see travelers’ perspectives organized around locations that are hard to get elsewhere. Like the simple nav too! | One of the better apps for creatives, it incorporates text, photo & video to allow anyone with a creative eye to present their work and/or their life in the most beautiful way possible as “Stories” or “Moments.” | I’ve been on this app for many moons.  I’ve seen all the changes.  Some I love, some irk me to no end!

The best thing about this app is that you can explore the world from your phone.  You can plan vacations, workaround and add to your bucket list without the hassle of talking to a travel agent or scrolling for hours on other social media networks.  

O probably should also mention that  it’s simple to use and easy to share content to other platforms.

Download it today! | So cool to see how this app has changed over the years. I remember this before search was even added. Keep up the great work :-) | I just started using the Stellar app this week and cannot put it down! I love adding stories and seeing the cool new places I want to visit. And soooo easy to use. I’ve been looking for an authentic travel app and THIS.IS.IT! | I’ve had major issues with this app from trying to create an account to trying to post my first post. It seems either something is wrong with their servers or with the app. The only way I have been able to get in was by using a VPN. Even then the functionality still isn’t there. Considering who built this app I find that very odd. | Screw the algorithms, ads, and noise of your other social apps. Steller is a simple and beautiful way to discover and create stories. Turn the camera roll on your phone into beautiful stories to share with families and friends. I use this for trip recaps, building my travel hit list, and discovering hidden gems and adventure ideas. I can’t recommend this app enough. It’s so fun and easy to use. | I love Steller for finding travel recommendations and keeping up with friends travels. The new feature, Moments, makes it even easier to share things on the go! Great way to connect with fellow creators 😍 | This app was so great but I still can’t figure out why they had to make every page auto advancing. I’m having to pause every page and it makes the entire experience feel rushed. There are other apps for that. This should be for well told stories that deserve more than 2 seconds per page. | I started using Steller recently and I love it! It’s such a great way to share travel stories and it is also perfect for sourcing inspo and tips for upcoming trips. It works well, has all of the necessary features, and the user base is full of like minded individuals who love to travel, get outside, and explore. | Been on the App for les than thirty minutes and my mind is blown. Incredible content from real travelers. Bravo Steller. | I used to love this app when it launched but this has become hard to use and needlessly complicated to create. | App is wonderful but I really need to be able to turn the sound off. I have the sound turned off on my phone most of the time so I’m not disturbing anyone else nearby. But the music plays on every story with no way to turn it off. Have to turn the volume all the way down, then hope I remember to turn it back up later. Really a miss in an otherwise great app and platform. | I cant reset my password knowing my username. I haven't logged in for about a year and yet my account is viewable. 

None of possible emails (of 3) received any reset email. | This app is honestly amazing, all I want to figure out is how to move the frame around so the photo i want to post i can center the subject in the frame but I’m sure that’s coming. Love this app so far! | I have been searching for an app that I could switch to from IG, since IG has so many ads these days. Steller is stunning! It’s not as active as Instagram, but I love that there are no ads and I can choose who to follow without algorithm suggestions. | I love this app, but is there anyway to pay for the service so there will no longer be a watermark on the page if I repost to other social media accounts? It ruins the clean layout of the page, and that is why I use this app in the first place. | When I first stumbled on this app, I was a love! A beautiful story book play this year short simple stories through photos and an economy of words would be ideal for sharing. Unfortunately, it has a ludicrous Instacrap format to it that you cannot control the speed in which to consume it. If I wanted IG, I would’ve just gone with the real thing, but since I am not 14, there’s no reason to go with it. Bring back the old storybook format! | I love Steller because I can tell stories and write through a social media app. I’ve only done one post but I already love the app! So much fun, and very simple. It isn’t confusing at all. (That sounded sarcastic but it wasn’t, I’m serious) 100000% recommend. | I really wanted to use and love this app.... I created a story but was unable to upload it I reached out to stellar via Twitter. Someone reached out to me and tried to help but then dropped off the face of the earth it’s been over a month and I’ve yet to hear from anyone. I’m close to deleting it at this point there’s just no point in having an app I can’t use. What’s worse your story doesn’t save on their sever so if I delete and reinstall the app I’ll loose my story ..... so wish I could have enjoyed it but oh well it is what it is | This is all that you need. One app for all your Instagram stories need! | Para mi es la mejor aplicación que he encontrado para escribir mis historias con fotografías. Las herramientas son fácil de utilizar y quedan muy bonitas una vez finalizado el trabajo. Saludos desde Costa Rica | Update: Since recent updates to app,
Some of the best previous features are gone. It is not as easy to format and select styles, captions, and even to import photos. 
A wonderful medium for sharing stories - art, photography, recipes - easy to use. Highly recommend for creatives and appreciation. | Love how Steller has some beautiful and simple templates to help share photos of my travels and add tips and notes about the destinations. The new map feature is helpful for finding unique spots to explore. I also love that the stories can be downloaded and shared easily to IG, making story creation useful for multiple platforms. | Minimalist visual storytelling. It's perfect, easy, and across multiple channels. Done. | I love this app... it’s clean, it’s classy very easy to maneuver. We all have A story to tell. Make it Stellar. | I just started doing this and I just read a review and I feel like the person had some very good points; it would be great to do little family skits and save them together and eventually combine all these skits to become a movie night actual mo a movie type bigger one you can include” just to have them in one place and all of the projects saved. I love checking out the stye 
This is not an option yet.  I also would like to change the theme for new videos etc.  Nonetheless, I will be using this one specifically probably more than a few Thera I’m will to train myself to use. Thanks overall. Looking forward to many acquaintances I love and we support each other. If you would like to pitch in too, show posts to others and get help when stumped, it’s all good. You’ll belong. Children are encouraged to have interest in family stories. Not like is new grannies, and considered more than me and my family adventures aka best comedy to pee your pants from low bladder function.  Overall:    Thanks for all this! My new scrapbook project/ video family scrapbooking new is waiting to start. Too happy to form memories in an updated. | User experience is great with this app. Everything is where I expect I'm going to find it when navigating through it. I find that really important because apps that are easy to use keep me coming back. I'm really loving it! | It’s pretty cool! Lol helped me step my story and post game up a bit lol | Title ^

Otherwise great app, simple and not bloated. Minimalistic yet functional.
Love it. | One app I’ve kept around on my iPhone but the iPad version is less than desired! Like half the apps available it does this weird non-full screen thing that has a black border that takes up 1” of of the screen on both sides! Until that’s fixed I’m iPhone only :( | Nice clean design layouts, and it’s perfect for me to get my artwork out there! Easy user interface. | This app is simple and straight to the point more articles should be like this versus beating around the bush | I’d been working on a post for stellar for quite some time, putting in hours of effort. 
Months later I went back to add other thoughts and pictures to this draft and it’s gone... 

I’m sooo upset. So much work done that I will never get back. 

Hoping Stellar will reach out with a solution. Hopefully they can recover it. | Love this app so much!!! | I can see how this could be a great way to share photos in a story format. I might be overlooking it but I feel there needs to be an option to change the background color. Not just by purchasing blush, but custom color, or even a photo from album. Also I think the option to rearrange the photo spots to where I want would be fantastic. Other than that simple to use and nice designs. | Just downloaded and it’s great so far | I hate this app. Bought several fonts and now they’re all gone. And it doesn’t do a square format for Instagram. Also, the choices in the purchased fonts are really lame. Meh!!!! | Occasionally I wish I could better place my picture in the frame, though.  But still, I have been having a blast using this app and have told everybody I know who takes pics about it! | I am completely in love with this app. You can explore truly beautiful photography and true stories. The app is not full of people that are just posting random stuff. I am truly hoping that it stays as amazing as this.",4.72557,962,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/23/a7/df/23a7df91-f1c0-2c9d-e555-5de94b887748/efe6a37b-d6b9-4bb9-86c5-0f94e8ac81c4_iOS-Screen-1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/9c/99/f3/9c99f357-f660-b5a1-8630-03afd5824af4/baad08fa-e506-4e21-99d5-fc77ce404699_iOS-Screen-2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/94/db/e8/94dbe8e2-b015-7637-fb8c-1eb40cb27249/9b306927-3745-4f5f-b5bb-7bca01b14470_iOS-Screen-3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/11/18/ba/1118bad1-4bd1-ec2b-e338-1129dc8d5cb2/f3125067-659f-47c6-be35-f42717ef1d78_iOS-Screen-4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/49/2d/aa/492daa0f-4165-dbcf-3dab-6eef4d6b98cf/0b756676-985b-4fc5-bd1a-b7a349b3ea42_iOS-Screen-5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/05/c9/e8/05c9e8c0-baac-9c64-f12a-69a5f597a258/169b58f1-6af4-45fd-9b52-3bcb77358858_iOS-Screen-6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/28/42/f6/2842f69c-a8da-e8b0-71ad-0a5ff6e6cea9/a305905e-6ad8-4b5a-9cb2-10b776d34586_iOS-Screen-7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/85/c9/23/85c923c8-1d08-9585-d919-9c57ed969905/43dc975d-246e-45bc-bee7-a3fa5f218f63_iOS-Screen-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/48/78/5e/48785e72-9c4e-5f66-bb8e-7b29d78a2d65/ce7262f3-829e-4db1-992a-c06bd76f7f3d_iOS-Screen-9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I have NEVER done social media before.  No FB, InstaGram, etc.  I’m old school.   But my trip to Spain to walk the Camino de Santiago demanded that I post (socially) my travel adventures.  First for my wife and secondly for my mom!  So I hunted and searched for the best-simple-way to post daily pics, videos -and comments. And what I heard from multiple sources was “FindPenguins”!   So here I am.  It is user friendly.  Today is my very first day on my Camino and also beginning to use this app.  And I have already successfully entered 4 “foot prints”.   Join the app and you’ll see what I mean. | On my fifth trip with FindPenguins and absolutely love the app. Don’t really like sharing my traction FaceBook and other social.This lets me pick who I share with and encourages me to write a little each day while traveling. 

The best book is the book you can print once you finish, they are very well designed and printed. | This travel blog is so simple to use, add pictures, write notes, and caption photos. Love it! | This is the first app I’ve used of this kind. I’m using the free version. 
I like being able to load pictures but do wish I could add more than 20. Also, I need to learn more about how things work- like if I can add maps and such. 
It’s one of hard for me to keep up with doing it every travel day but it’s the best I’ve ever done before so I’m really happy with it for that reason | I spent considerable time trying to find a travel app that would create a breadcrumb map, allow me post pictures and text and share with friends and on social media. FindingPenguins is it. I tested it for a few days and it seemed user friendly. I just started my real trip and am really enjoying it. My only recommendation is to adding boating as a travel type (I’m not on a cruise or sailing but I am traveling on a boat). | A fan and user of FindPenguins on my phone and ipad, I really hope for a native Mac version which will be stable and less buggy.  Trying to use this version on a Mac is fraught with incompatiabilities. 

My two main complaints:
1. As soon as you try to reorder photos, the app partially crashes with a thumbnail on the screen of the photo you tried to move until you force-quit the app.

2. The spelling and grammer check constantly rewrites perfectly correct and normal words, or cuts you off in the middle of typing.  Its horrid.  If you try to turn off Spelling and Grammer correction in the menu, for some inexplicable reason it will return within just a few minutes on its on, and will continue screwing with your text.  

The app is so annoying that using the browser version is often better, but also fails in that it can't read from the photo library.

Overall a dissapointing offering and much less usable than the mobile versions. | So far I am liking the app.  Am still getting used to using it and using its features. It is easy to post to Facebook and also easy to do an entry. I am hoping a photo book at the end of our trip will be easy too. | Loving it | This app has taken the drudgery out of kee a scrapbook of trips and events; I love how simple it is! | We have posted several days and our friends appear to be following us. Time will tell how successful we have been. So far it’s been easy to use and my 80 year old parents figured out how to follow us. | I have used this app for 5 years.  I first used the free app but upgraded so I could add more photos to an entry.  
The things I love about the app - I can look back on trips and remember where we stayed or an activity we did.  I like that I can share my travels with only those who I want to see them.   
I like that I can make a travel book easily after a trip. 
Things I didn’t like
I find it can be glitchy.  It has closed the app on me when I load photos.  Something it just goes black when I am typing.   Usually it saves what I’ve been working on by not always.  I’ll give it 5 stars when the app doesn’t have the glitches. | This app helps us keep in touch with family and friends when we travel. Very easy to use and lots of fun. | Just started to use it but quite impressed | I'm late to the tracking game and this app makes it so easy to add your old stuff by using your photo's metadata. I'm specifically comparing it to Polar Steps, I don't think it had that capability or if it did, it was difficult to figure out. Antarctica was particularly difficult since I didn't have internet and there aren't really any ""landmarks"" so being able to use metadata and automatically is such a treat. | Great way to keep in touch with friends and family- especially when traveling through areas with spotty internet! | If you have the discipline to do an entry every day or so, your friends and you have a documented trip in more or less real time. Hard to beat. My only issue has been sometimes trouble editing once I posted. | I went on Camino with this app and I am amazed at how well it tracked my trip! not to say my battery was not drained even after full day of use. Highly recommend, and I will use this for all my future trips | The app I find is hard to operate and if you don’t have internet can’t download | It’s too hard to navigate this website. It doesn't allow for enough photos or narration, so I stop using it | So easy to write a travelogue. | Easy to use. | Fun and easy to use. Great way to connect with family back home. | I love this app! Allows my friends and family to follow my adventures 💗 | Spent an incredible adventure and took Find Penguins along on the journey.  Oh my…what a beautiful way to keep family back home up to date about what we were experiencing while keeping off the social media platforms which inform everyone ‘I’m away on vacation’.  May I say how much I love Find Penguins and am recommending it to my people when they travel! | I’d give this 5 stars but I have the hardest time finding footprints that I put in the “upload later” because I haven’t finished with that post. It’s always hunting around & then it just shows up somehow! | We have friends in Switzerland that turned us onto this app. Great alternative to Facebook. | I have used other systems for creating blogs. However, I absolutely love this app. The eloquence and simplicity in creating text, photos and mapping is wonderful. Everything is so logically set up and organized. I love how I can easily add 20 photos and even 2 videos to my text. Great job. It is wonderful for travel blogs. At the end of the day I can polish off my text, photos and video in 15 minutes. | I used this app for the first time on an around the world cruise of 4 months. I wanted a record for us and for our grandchildren. The electronic version of the app was wonderful to share as we traveled, but the BOOK absolutely knocked us out. Will be using this app for all future travels!!! | I love this app - I traveled on a cruise and used this to keep family and friends updated on our travels. It was very easy to use and I liked how it tracked my travels. I like that there are limits on what you can post and I think it’s just enough.  I would highly recommend this app.  Actually, did recommend it to fellow travelers. | I have been using this to chronicle our sailing adventures from Michigan  to the Bahamas and I love using it daily. I can easily write a post, add my photos and videos from the day, and upload at night for friends and family who are following (sharing the app is also easy). When I’m done with a “chapter” of our journey, I can edit a little and then easily prepare a book for printing- seeing a preview before I print. By ordering a book I get a free ebook to share. It’s easy to use and edit, tracks our journey, records our stats, and creates a beautiful book in the end. Easy Peasy! | And hard to navigate. Ought to be more intuitive. | If you want to capture tour traveling memories and stimulate your creativity in photo,  video and ruminations, then take a little time to learn this app. It’s intuitively built and easy to use on the fly. Keep your device charged so you may track your footprints. You will create a path whenever you make a footprint. Even if you footprint your trips to the bathroom! 😛 | I’m not sure how this app isn’t more popular than it is! Fantastic, easy-to-use, and perfect to keep family and friends updated on your travels. The map feature is particularly impressive. | Find Penguins is a well developed and stable platform that delivers exactly as it promises-
A user friendly way to memorialize travels and actually enjoy the digital
Photos we all store on our phones. 
I have now used it for two trips, a world cruise and a trip to Ireland. It’s fun to create wonderful memories using the app and I highly recommend you give it a try. About one hour reviewing the articles in the FAQ’s and you’ll be all set to go! | We’ve used this app for multiple trips. It’s easy to use and has great functionality. | The app is great, especially for those of us that are non-Facebookers. One area that needs improvement is the set up for people following others. A comment to me from people I invited to follow us is that it was not easy to just follow us, i.e, down the app then get to my trip. That's all. Otherwise I love it | I love how easy it is to add photos from any photo folder on my iPhone and the interactive map. We haven’t tried the printed books yet, but it sounds amazing. 

Our family and friends have found it hard to see our travel log and the settings can be a little confusing so we only have one family follower who has been able to figure it out, so we keep a separate shared iCloud folder for everyone else.  We also had a friend who was added to someone else’s trip (mistakenly) and  because we followed her there was no way to unfollow that particular random person’s trip to Germany 🤪… so that was frustrating for a bit.  Otherwise it’s great! 

I especially like that I can add photos as a draft even when we have a poor signal and add text and upload them later. ❤️ | First time user. Very intuitive. I liked I could start a footprint to get the location and finish later even if I had left the location. Making adjustments to my moves from place to place was messy and I gave up on it. I look forward to printing a book and seeing how it comes out. 😀 | Cool, I’m getting better at using the app! | It’s a great idea. I found it hard to navigate the options and got confused with my sharing privacy options. Nobody could see my posts & it was frustrating to me. I love the idea it was difficult. | I wish it had a few more features like notes you could add to photos. | Wonderful way yo stay in touch with friends and doucument as well. | Although this is our first trip using it, it’s been super easy to use so you’re not wasting time pressing lots of buttons. So far, I love it. | So far; I haven’t been able to upload photos from google or external hard drive to create past trips. I’m disappointed by that. Hopefully someone has advice or help. Without that feature, I wouldn’t see upgrading to pay for premium. I have photos from a camera I would like to use. 😕 
Making a photo album was simple and editing process was also easy. | Love it easy to use | I am a first time user of the Find Penguins app, using it to document my transatlantic crossing. This app does a great job of helping you time-stamp and memorialize waypoints along your journey. I wish I could post more than six pictures at each “footprint”, but the premium product does that (and more) for a cost. The standard version has a position tracker, which automatically geolocates you! I have not found this to be the big power-drain others have complained about. It would be really great if it allowed me to post my footprints on Instagram (hint hint) as it does for Twitter and Facebook users. This app is very intuitive and easy to use, I think you might like it too. | I used Find Penguins to record a recent trip to Central America. It excels at capturing details from photos and allowing you to quickly capture “footprints” along your journey.

I shared the link with family and friends and they were able to keep up with our journey.

It is supposed to capture waypoints along the way so that you can look back and recall places you’ve visited on a map. For the most part this works really well, but still seems a little buggy.

When I returned home, I was prompted to turn off automatic waypoint recording, which I did. About a week later I opened the app and realized it had continued running and my map now included a lot of extra waypoints.

I also noticed the map drew my return flight home as though I flew directly home, rather than through a connecting airport. 

Those points aside, this is a really great way to quickly capture details about your trip. | Super easy and fun to use this app!

Auto sort by date. I *sorely* wish it had auto-save: I lost good stuff due to Apple’s system glitch today 😢. Easy typing, *most* markdown support. Sometimes unexplained request for login: WT? | The app helps to put my thoughts in focus.
It’s a good planning tool and a quiet way to express myself.
I don’t do it everyday but it’s there when I’m ready.
I like revisiting the memories too. | Life time pay price on the app or no buy from me. I not subing to an app in the videogame era end of story. Greedy are we 99$ i would pay and for end all be all for life.

Ty good bye...!!! | Does the widget streak don’t work any more? | I was hoping that I finally found the journal app I was looking for, unfortunately that isn’t so. Before even reading the specifics with the app I thought it was finally a completely free app with multiple capabilities. As I was customizing my app to my liking, I was promoted to subscribe to a $35 yearly service. Honestly, it’s a NO for me. I’m so tired of these money hungry developers who take away the experience for others. Unfortunately I will have to delete this app, because I’m unable to utilize it the way I desire. Everything is a cost nowadays. | I’ve never written an app review before but this app is just absolutely perfect for my needs. I wanted a way to capture my days and add photos that will resurface in a meaningful way and this app is exactly what I was looking for. | I have tried a number of apps/systems to record my daily thoughts, experiences, and reflections. I always return to Day One. It is the perfect platform for me, and has all the features I need. Added to this is ny ability to access it across all my devices. I do not expect to stray from Day One anymore. | ANITHER UPDATE: April 2024. Syncing is now a disaster. I’ve been down on multiple devices and despite half a dozen emails and tons of log files, support has no idea. What happened to you, Day One ?!?! Curse you, Automatic Inc, for the decline of what was once a shining example of a customer focused app with rock solid support. You are hastening people’s move off the platform. I WANT to use the app but every month there’s a new issue. Bugs are popping up all over. UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE, 8/16/23: Nope, they're actually wrong. I'm a developer myself - you have a bug in your app. The exact commands referenced puts you in the same looped workflow of documentation and never opens the email client. And the revamped timeline still looks awful. I'm looking at alternative journal solutions - like Apple Journal or Bear Notes. Day One has gone backwards. UPDATED 8/1/23: They are making changes, and not for the better. Dropped from 3 stars to 2. They totally borked the time line view now - increasing the front size and adding useless data, so now you can only see like 3-4 entries at a time with lots of wasted space. Journal apps don't need constant UI changes. In fact - it's a problem. Journaling is a routine oriented task - and millions have adopted the Day One workflow. Changing it for no tangible benefit is crazy, and has me looking at Bear Notes and other alternatives. Who is driving these feature changes over there? It's getting worse... Oh - and despite being a premium user - you actually cannot contact support anymore! Their own documentation directs you to an area of the app that seems changed - it just redirects to old, outdated documentation instead of directing to an email message client. Yikes. If you are considering Day One as a newbie, consider something else. This app is not the clear winner it used to be. Fixes no one asked for, while user-favorite features (cough cough web app) are in perpetual Beta. OLD Review: The iOS app is great, but the application itself is severely lacking due to the recent, quiet, abandonment of their web browser app. They were working on it, and there was a highly anticipated beta - but it’s been shutdown and abandoned (they say temporarily, but it doesn’t look like it - they wouldn’t shut access down entirely if really temporary). There is currently no way to access any part of your journal on a windows desktop browser. So - the app is good, but it’s tedious in daily life as you can’t easily get items from your desktop into your journal. | I’ve been using it for years. Love it! | Paid full price for versions on ever device (iPad iOS and iMac) and now just pushing subscription model even though we were promised.  

Charging a subscription monthly to add media to posts seems an odd line to draw.  I use iCloud for storage and hosting.  So what why ?   

This subscription madness must end. | Used for 5 days and was very excited about it. Day 6 it's frozen and I can't log my entry. Bummer. It's annoying, but I guess I can just use the apple journal that comes on the iPhone. | Was so excited to try this app as it has such great reviews, but it is so glitchy I cannot even write an entry! The minute I hit plus to type a new entry, the entire app freezes. I’ve tried restarting my phone, opening the entry from a different path, and no matter what when I get to the page to type my entry, the app freezes. I hope there is a fix so that I can actually give this app a try. | Almost everything I would want from a digital journal is here.
It would be great to see some design updates and modernizations though. 
And please bring the macOS icon to mobile soon! The one on macOS matches the native app styles better. | Simple, beatiful and effective | Wanted to like it but the app is too frustrating if you don’t want it to use your soon ID username and password.  Too many options on the market ti deal with one poorly done. | Best journaling app available. I've tried several and they all fall short of Day One. Keep up the good work, devs.

EDIT:  ten years on with Day One and the app just keeps getting better and better | Whether you are new to journaling or a seasoned pro, this app has something for everyone.  Some of the things that I love about the app include pre-populated templates to begin your journaling.  If you have never journaled, this makes it easy to get started because you don’t have to think about what to write about.  If you are more seasoned and/or you know how and what you want to write about each day, you can easily build a custom template and begin with the same template each day.  
I love being able to add pictures to the journal as well.  There are several ways you can use this, but I prefer to add any pictures from the to day to my daily journal entry.  Some of the other features include being able to add or include other types of media to your entry.  Although I personally do not use this feature, it is cool to know its there. I also appreciate the timeline feature of the app.  This allows you to go back and see previous days, months and years.  It also allow a streak building for your journaling habit.  Highly recommend.  This and the Bible app are two apps that I use every day without fail. | I never review apps, but this app is exceptional. Probably my first written review of an app, but it goes above and beyond to make journaling from a phone so easy and intuitive. Many thanks to the creators 🙏 | Super frustrated with this app. I wanted to print a book for my son’s birthday and they payment will not go through. Also no real support is available. All these daily note that can’t be printed. So disappointed. | I’ve only had the app for a couple of days and I love it already. I haven’t had time to try the extra features but I will in the next few days. If this app measures up to its ratings and reviews It is going to be just the app I’ve been looking for. I will update this writing after using it for a month or so. | Love this app! | The features are awesome, and the best part is that it’s FREE! You get lots of features for free and never get ads or bugged to upgrade. Best journaling app ever! | Been using this app for years and I love it and recommend it to everyone — however , my one big complaint is that I can’t get it to work with Apple’s new “journaling suggestions” feature and can’t get an answer from the app’s support…. Frustrating not to be able to use this Apple feature and the lack of response is bothersome | It decided to just start crashing, even after updating. Five years of entries presumably floating in the ether unobtainable. | **update 4/5/2024: I got my Plus tier features back after reinstalling the app, thanks for the help from the Day One support. **

I paid for the app years ago before they changed to the subscription model, got over thousands entries in it. Suddenly my photo upload limited to only 1 per entry today, and was required to subscribe for premium if I want the original features back. Not gonna use Day One anymore for this reason, if they can do it to the old users, they can do whatever they like to anyone to maximise their profits any time later. | Been using Day One for a few years. It’s simple and reliable. Everything works smoothly. Love that they have desktop and mobile app. | I have used some form of diary for a long time. This is the best one I have ever used. It just seems to suit me. I am happy there are more notebooks available to use. I am experimenting with keeping a medical journal… Try it and just keep trying it 😀🌹

Even if you don’t do everything on it you think you should…it will be still be more than if you did nothing! | So convenient, I use it all the time. Love the user interface. Great enhancements. Keep it up! | I use DayOne every day. The clean and simple interface, the ease of use, location of entries, and most of all the entries on this day in past years make it an incredibly valuable app. One of very few apps that I cannot go without. | I highly recommend Day One. I have been using it for over a decade and think it’s the best on the market. In fact I live in fear it might someday go away! I have prints books from my journals and they come out beautifully and high quality. Treasured items in our home. | The help feature on this app is absolutely horrible! I used to love this app. I used it every single solitary day for almost a year and now I can’t log back in. I am in just the death cycle of trying and trying and trying and not getting the email sent to me for the password reset. I am really concerned because I have over 200 or more journal entries and I can’t access them or create new journal entries. I used to use the text feature to add a journal entry and it was so easy but now I can’t login. I don’t know if it’s because I got a new phone or what. But as I said, at the beginning, the help feature on this app is absolutely horrible. THEN THEY TRY TO PATHETICALLY answer / of COURSE I have an email with the login and there’s ZERO WAYS to actually get help. There’s no way to get to an actual person.

And now I get a THIRD response and STILL NO ONE ANSWERS!! I have been in the same death loop of help. I get no email yet that’s the email I’m using. | I purchased the Day One Premium on January 7, 2024, through the Apple Store along with another app called ‘Me+’. The total was $59.52 ($34.99 for Day One with a promotion, $19.99 for Me+, plus tax). I attempted to cancel and get a refund for ‘Me+’, but since it was purchased together with Day One, I couldn’t receive a partial refund. I got fully refunded $59.52 on January 18.

However, I recently discovered that I was rebilled by Apple on January 29, but I cannot access the Premium since it shows as cancelled. I can provide my bank transactions and the receipt from Apple.

Please help! I’ve tried reaching out to customer service, but there’s been no response. I haven’t been able to use the Premium features for the past three months. Can you please check?

I love this app. I will fix my rate once my concern is resolved. | I’ve been using Day One for seven years now. In the beginning I tried some other options but nothing worked for me as well as Day One. It’s really good at what it is and fits all my needs just right. 
Thank you for making a great app and thank you for continuing to maintain and improve it!! | Love Day One! Began writing daily on a challenge a few yrs back, have since grown to love my daily pondering, and especially seeing my pics from my phone for REAL when I send it to print 3x a yr! | I don’t know that this review is worth much as I have never used any other digital journal but for my many purposes, Day One is perfect.  I liked it so much I purchased another subscription for my spouse but she still prefers a paper journal with her fountain pen.  And here’s where the huge differences between the two forms really shows up.  When she wants to find the date when something happened, it’s a laborious search.  I just type the event or name or place into the search feature and I get all the hits, the most recent entry first.  With Day One I can add photos, video links, emails, texts, or even parts of daily newsletters I get as instantly as a 72 year old man can do anything instantly.  I have separate journals for books bought, borrowed, and read, for projects I’m working on, and for travelogues.  For my spouse to do any of those things is nye impossible in a paper journal just from a space standpoint.  And if I too want the feel and flow of ink on paper, which I often do, I do just that and take a photo to enter on my digital journal.
	But it’s when you’ve been at Day One for awhile that some of it’s marvelous features begin to show up.  The “On This Day” feature is a treat.  For instance, today it shows that I have four entries for today.  To click on that and discover anew what I was doing three, four, five years ago today is, in addition to being fun and informative, a daily jolt regarding the passage of time.
	Two other features I love about Day One is that it syncs my journal across all my devices.  I can jot down an entry on my phone when I’m waiting in line at the car wash or having lunch in a diner.  I can check on an entry from last year when I’m on the go.  The other thing I prize is the privacy.  My Day One is password protected which allows me to be a little more free with personal details than I otherwise would be.
	Does Day One have some warts.  I’ve yet to meet an app that doesn’t but, again, for my needs this things I would like different are so few that I haven’t even bothered mentioning them to management.  I hope I’ve made it clear why I think this app deserves five stars. | Love this journal and look at it everyday.  I’ve been writing in it for 12 years now. I go look at what I was doing this day for the last 12 years. I don’t even remember some of the thing I wrote and I’m so glad for each and every memory. Thanks Day One for a quality product. | One of the features I love, having used Day One for several years, is that it lets me know I have previous entries from same date in years past and of  gives me access to read entries from same dates in years past. 
 Day One also has a search feature that easily helps me to find topics that I wrote about last week or last year. | I bought Day One for iOS and OSX but didn’t feel the need to purchase a subscription. I would have if it offered features I couldn’t live without, but it doesn’t, so why spend the money unnecessarily? I’ve rated this app two stars because the journal is good, even if buggy at times. I couldn’t go more than two stars because I don’t think it’s right that they reserve live support for subscriptions only. I paid money for your apps and should be able to get support when needed. I can see giving subscription members priority support and making others wait longer, but to not offer live support to those that have supported and purchased your products before subscriptions were even a thing is just wrong. If a subscription offered me something I needed, I’d buy it, but I don’t need to add more than ten photos or videos to my entries. And I certainly won’t pay just to get support. In fact, that alone is reason enough to never buy the subscription. You might as well call your subscription a support plan, not a subscription. | I have a brain injury, so I have very very poor penmanship... but I have always love love LOVED the idea of journaling so so much though, so I started to journal first on Microsoft Word on that app on my phone, but the very annoying thing about doing that was that I had to keep scrolling down down down alllllll the way until I found where I left off! 👎🏼 I first got so annoyed that I started to reverse my order of journal entries so that the first thing I could do when I opened Word was write my newest journal entry! It eventually got so messy and long though, so then I thought, “there’s GOT to be something else out there!!! This is the 21st century for Christ’s sake!!!” Then, I opened the App Store and found Day One, and my life was literally changed forever, and I could not be more thankful for this app!!! 🤩🤩🤩 I’m currently using Day One’s free premium trial, and it’s so great that I wish so so badly I could make my own money bc if I did, I would TOTALLY pay for a subscription immediately!!! Too bad I only have so long until my trial ends... 😔 | The recording of your life will become invaluable later in life. This app’s feature makes it easy to do that. The ability to sync between devices is a win over apples basic journal app. | This is the best digital journal app I’ve found I love being able to see what days I’ve journaled and it’s a great way to try to journal every day! | Emailed DayOne Journal to cancel as I’m not getting anywhere w/ Apple to cancel through the App Store … and DayOne is the ONLY app I have that has not responded because all I go was a bot.  They gave me an email (through the app) but the automatic generated email, send you back to App Store or the bot.  You will get NO WHERE trying to stop this subscription.  If you purchase this, and lose your appleid and apple can’t seem to help you w/ that either (that’s another story) …  be prepared to pay for this app for the rest of your life or until your cc expires. | Features of the Journal program can’t be beat. Have used it for years and have never had a problem. When I’ve had questions customer support can’t be beat. | Been using several years and it’s been great for me. | Ggggg | Every day, I think about the things I am grateful for and it reminds me of the good in my life. Moments of positivity. | Great app. Easy to navigate and use. | I downloaded this app over the weekend. I have been using Day One (original) for 5 years. I was so excited to use the new and improved version; however, it is constantly (and by constantly, I mean with each and every use) crashing. No matter what I try to do (write a new entry, look at historical entries etc) or where I try to do it (iPhone vs iPad), the app freezes, and the only way to fix the issue is to close the app and go back in. Further, even when I am typing on the new app, there is a big lag in the words. Please please please fix this. This app would be perfect if only it didn't freeze all the time! | Best journaling app ever!!! | I’ve been using DayOne for years.
I love it!
It is easy to keep track of my life and look back over the years to see how far I’ve come.

Nomad was a quick solution, and although I’ve never been using eSIM, setting it up was really easy. | Probe Nomad para mi reciente viaje a Estados Unidos. Comenzó a funcionar desde que me bajé del avión y cubrió todo mi viaje.. es buenísima. La recomiendo | All I can say is that I’ve had nothing but good experiences with this app. My wife and I have used both the Asian and European eSIM offered by Nomad and it has worked brilliantly, and is quite affordable relative to most other options. Furthermore, the user interface is easier than some and their instructions for use are clear and easy to follow. Best of all, their customer support has been almost immediate, to the point and effective. They even followed up to thank me after I let them know that a minor issue had been resolved with their kind help. Stellar ❣️❣️❣️ | Good connection around Europe so far except some underground spot in UK. | Since the apec is a Hong Kong esim at its base, tiktok is disabled as long as the esim is turned on. Nomad should have used a Singapore or similar country as the home country of their esims so that users don't get caught up in Beijing's security law. | Lots of issues changing countries, not ideal for nomads. 

Support is fine until there’s a problem they can’t solve. 

In my case they just disappeared for DAYS and you only get an apology email days later for the long delay. 

It saves time, and is safer, to use a traditional eSIM. I almost did, but my ride app was working fine with airport WiFi.

But imagine being in a taxi in a foreign country where you don’t know the language and can’t see where the driver is taking you. 

I’d contacted support one or two days before my flight to avoid issues like this, explaining that I’ll be in a new country and asking how to ensure the installation goes smoothly.

I also reached out from both the departure airport and the arrival airport. Still, I was left with no connection because the app wasn’t working properly.

I could send and receive support messages on the app but nothing else worked, it kept freezing up. 

I tried 4 different apps, including the ride app, and all worked perfectly, except Nomad. 

If this issue is resolved it would be a great service. Hopefully tech can figure it out. | We used Nomad eSIM’s a few times and overall we would recommend their products.
Used it in China on an iPad Mini and it worked like a charme. Installation was easy, great connection and good data speeds.
Recently we used a Nomad provided eSIM in Argentina and it has been rather disappointing. They use Movistar and Personal for cellular service and their connections as well as the speeds have been rather disappointing.
Our regular US cell service with T-Mobile connected to Claro - no compari! So much better availability, much faster and reliable connections.
The China experience was a 5 star, Argentina a 3 star at best. We will still use Nomad in future but they should definitely look for other/better carriers in Argentina. | Instalacion sencilla y relativamente rápida | Website works great on mobile son it’s fine, but I really wish I could stay logged into the app on two devices at once. Also, lately I get an error when I try to add on data, so I have to go to the website. 

But customer service is TOP NOTCH and worth dealing with some bugs. | I used this app in India and it worked great! I did have to use a VPN while in country to reload it, otherwise no issues. | It was not working properly in Bangalore, India but all was ok in Bangkok, Singapore and Korea. | Worked perfectly for my trip to Germany | I am traveling on vacation with my family and did not want to pay the $10 a day from my US cell phone provider. I downloaded the Nomad app. I full capabilities on my phone! | On my trip to Australia I bought the e-sim online; the qr code installed easily but the internet didn't work and I was never able to use it; I tried several contacts with support to ask for a refund and only received automatic responses; I don't recommend it to anyone... buy it at the airport and you won't have any problems. | This e-sim application saved me in India when the local sim was turned off due to a silly, complicated Visa misunderstanding. Although it’s more expensive than getting a local SIM card, it’s hassle free and easy if you take your time and follow the setup instructions. All we need nowadays is data, and NOMAD connected me to the network with speed and reliability. Took less than 15 minutes. Thanks! | Total fail in installing the plan I purchased from Nomad. I'm visiting Argentina, downloaded and paid for the plan (iPhone 15 iOS 17) . The *paying for it* is the ONLY part that worked. I have spent three hours of my life trying to use what I bought from Nomad -- but have failed with every restart, reboot, each dive back into iPhone Cellular settings to change settings per conflicting directions on Nomad site and app. Included in Nomad’s fails are useless instructions, conflicting pop up screens, and ... buried at the end one of of the two “Congratulations on purchasing” emails from Nomad ... notice that the eSim was actually provided by ""eSim Go"". That latter fail was enough to send me down a thirty-minute rabbit hole getting rid of “ESim Go” so that I could succeed with Nomad. Conflicting instructions on how to activate, tech support only available after a business day, FAQ article useless. The New York Times should retract their endorsement. Epic fail.

Update 2/6/2024:

Dear Nomad, 

Kindly do not accuse me of making things up in your online reply. Here are subject lines of the TWO emails I received from Nomad after I paid:

1. Welcome to Nomad! Travel like a local with eSIM!
2. Here is how you access your Nomad plan!

Sadly, neither email was helpful in actually making the plan functional. Eventually, a colleague who’s an IT prefessional and an iPhone iOS expert got me going … only after the three hours lost mentioned in my initial review.

(Note that juggling the email screen, and the Nomad screen, the many Nomad popups, and the multiple Settings screens within my iPhone made the nightmare even worse). | The eSIM I bought is very fast and easy to use
Will buy it next time | I did extensive research on many eSIM choices for my travel from the US to Portugal and Malta. I decided to give nomad a shot and am very pleased. I had a tech question and submitted it via the app and they were very responsive and also followed up on my satisfaction. I was out of the US for 15 days and decided to choose the 10 MB package, which was much cheaper than other eSIM providers. On day 13, I have only used 3 MB and I have been on maps the entire time while walking. The service is great with no dead spots. 
I’d be happy to recommend nomad to all. | I want to use the app but the after sending the code to my email, the keyboard will not appear to type it in. I have done everything to try and force the keyboard open but it won’t pop up. Waste of time. | Well, I don’t expect too much from these companies but when I finally needed customer service, they failed miserably. 
Aíralo is also pretty bad but I recommend their eSIM app over this one. 
And finally, I recommend a phone with a SIM card slot … the new iPhones for the US market don’t  have them anymore. It’s the only reason I need buy eSIM in the first place | First time trying it out, I like it so far and will keep using if all continues smoothly. Even got $3 off with a promo code. | The unlimited plan caps you at 2gb a day, but it’s incredibly hard to find this fine print before you purchase a plan. (Like literally impossible, they have no reference to data capping on their terrible website). Their app is unintuitive, their data plans are OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced (Lyca mobile is less than half the price for more data in the UK) and in general I’ve had such an unpleasant experience. Not sure who they paid for their good reviews but I’m really upset | Make sure you use a temp email to sign up for this service. They claim they only send *one* marketing email per month but it’s one per day. Unsubscribe and they will send you another marketing email the very next day and the day after and so on. | love using nomad, extremely easy to navigate and makes traveling headache-free. ran into some issues and customer service reps were able to get it resolved within 24 hours. will continue to use nomad for my international travels 😊 | Great customer service, I had an issue with an eSim purchased for Brazil and they were quick to resolve the issue and issue a refund. I’ve used them traveling abroad in Switzerland, Italy, and England and had a great experience. Only advice is to pay attention to what countries are offered on the eSim (Switzerland likes to be special and require their own) but Nomad is very up front in which Sims work where | I was traveling in Europe and got an eSIM from Nomad.   It worked great until I used up my bucket of data.   When I was hit my original usage limit and rolled over to the new bucket, it said it was used immediately.   I contacted their support department and was told they were looking into it.  Every day for a week, they sent me a message that said they were still looking into it, then they stopped updating me.  I returned home, so I don’t need it anymore, but I never got any kind of resolution. | I used Nomad to purchase data plans for a trip to China and Hong Kong with mixed experiences. I installed the China esim before my trip and activation was seamless on arrival. My experience with the HK esim was not as positive. Checkout in the app repeatedly returned a generic error message. I was only able to complete the transaction by removing the promo code—frustrating because the deal was being promoted in the Nomad app. Once I completed the purchase and activated the esim, I was unable to get connectivity. The troubleshooting steps in the app were not helpful. I contacted support for both issues and they were responsive but unfortunately due to time zones differences I lost a full day’s use of the plan I paid for because Nomad’s default network configuration was incorrect. The idea of seamless access to international data plans is great, but be prepared to be anchored to wifi to troubleshoot on arrival abroad. | Awesome travel app for Europe and US. Saved me lots of money and fast connections. | Bought a 45 day plan and so far only getting 4G in Seoul. Literally one of the best markets to have 5G 🔥 but I’m poking around like a peasant. iPhone 15 Pro. 3 stars for being average. | I was hesitant to try Nomad on a three week trip given some negative reviews but it worked seamlessly for using different cell providers in 6 countries or regions :  Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan.  At every stop the service worked without a hitch, never needed to reboot or wonder what went wrong. | Stopped working in US and support does not answer | I travel the world a lot and often and this app is one of the best things for me. To be able to easily have date anywhere is fantastic. 
Easy to use and get access to the esims | It works ok but I don’t receive phone calls for my us phone number or text messages. Add on feature failed and I was left without data. Data randomly stopped working one time and I had to rely on my primary carrier for data to navigate a foreign cut in the pouring rain at night. Use with caution and have back up plans. Not recommended if you use us phone number as you won’t be able to call or text with foreign data enabled. | Easy to install fast connection,good signal even in crowded areas, glad to use Nomad
( thanks for sale packages ) 🥰 | All worked smoothly, easy app installation, easy activation, 10 gb for only $12 USA. What more can you ask. I even got 5G speed in cities. | I’ve purchased a APAC 20GB for 45 days . The data shows 5 G but only can run 5Mpbs. you can barely do anything with this internet. | I used in Switzerland and worked really good! | In the midst of a genocide, thousands bought e-sims for people who don’t have access to telecommunications and internet. Nomad made changes to ensure that these people couldn’t use their e-sims. Absolutely not reliable and grossly dehumanizing. | Don’t bother wasting your time with this. The internet speed was so slow it wasn’t even connected… literally. It acted fast for the first 30 minutes and then got so slow it couldn’t even load the plan in the app. I deserve my money back and so does anybody that ever bought this crap | Would rather have paid more for actual 5g speeds from a legit provider | Upon arriving in Barcelona, Spain I started my Nomad connection. No hiccups, just plain access to my text, WhatsApp… etc.
One little problem created by a conflict between my expired purchase and the new SIM, I contacted the help support and… the team could not be more professional, dedicated, knowledgeable.
The communication was excellent and prompt.
I recommend NOMAD with the certainty that it will make your life easier. | Used in Australia and New Zealand. For the most part it works fairly well. The app is quite good compared to others and using Apple Pay is nice. The downside is that you will get a Hong Kong IP address, which can be a bit sluggish and cause issues with apps and websites that block Hong Kong. For Example, Citi Bank and TikTok will refuse to work. Even on local WiFi, TikTok will not work unless you turn the eSIM off in your phone settings. | Thanks guys!!
Easy to buy 
Easy to install
And it works!!! | Bought a 45-day plan for Asia 16 countries. Worked well 7 days in Seoul Korea, plus 2 days in Shanghai China. Stoped working after no matter how try. | Muy buena app para viajar, buenos precios, fácil para recargar los planes. Abarcan muchos países. | I purchased wrong data plan by mistake. And I contacted customer service in help center. They responded quickly and help me to canceled wrong one. And also teach me to purchased correct one. | My husband and I travel full time worldwide and using the Esim has been a huge money saver. Installation process is easy, even for this retired lady😉 When I have run into any issues their support team is quick to respond and walk me through the process. Currently in Japan and Rachel was quick to help me solve an oversight on my part in the simple installation process. Use my referral code if you want to save on your first use TEAC55AJ | You download the app and start using your phone with the number that was given to you. It is that easy. Compared to another app I bought, NOMAD is much friendlier. Highly recommend this without any hesitation. I used this for my Italy trip and had no problem at all. So what are you waiting for? Go get this.

I wish my club would go back to routes printed on paper. | It not very clear how to use. | Definitely frustrating to try and set up a trip | It would be nice to know how to navigate this app. It feels like something that could be useful, but I am having trouble figuring it out. | Sharing with the family doesn’t work | So EASY to use, we transfer files (trips) between our IPDADsthen we independently review

We can easily pull up old trips to find our good memories along with data like cost, distance, how long we stayed….

Who could ask for anything more! | All the app does is display a map of your route. Pain to have to open computer to get more info when phone is always handy. No arrival or departure dates, no address of destination pin. Pretty much just a non functional picture. But the desktop part is great. | I like the idea but the map lacks detail… one of the reasons I don’t like Apple Maps.  Wish it would interstate with Google maps. I find that Google maps has more detail not just major highways. | App is not intuitive, gave up trying after 5min | Hard to use | I paid so I can save my trip and it is telling me I can not save my file.  Also, it does not auto-populate the addresses. | To think about what point you want to go from another point where you want to begin.
This one like the three others I tried make you start from where you are and want to track you where you progress.
I am flying somewhere else then driving from there. No pin drop allowed without exact address or data downloaded from something else. Planning not allowed.
Want 5 stars? Dumb it down and allow me to be smart. Allow me to just put pins in cities and towns and pick my path and once complete compute the distances and let me decide how far I want to go and drop pins in hotels and campgrounds and places to eat. 
Collect what I want from me and then collate. 
Going to just go sit at google maps and print to pdf after I look it all up myself. | I spent four hours planning a trip, and when I came back to it, the stops were scrambled with regard to the order along the way.  Many were also missing, even though I added them using addresses, city, state, etc. | Miles, time, tolls, ...  Trying to plan a trip, but this version won’t specify details from one location to the next? | This app dose not have all roads, just main ones most county and state roads do not exist, this app is useless. I type in an address it goes to nearest town, with no roads.  🤷‍♂️ | Not able to get support without joining google groups, then the support is mostly other users.

The app doesn’t recognize that I paid for it. So won’t save or route my trip, therefore useless to me. Apple App Store marks it paid for 
So bummed can’t get it to work | Tried to use the demos numerous times and kept crashing.

Contacted support and they said try a different browser-safari, no luck, Firefox, no luck, Chrome, no luck on either my iPhone or IPAD.

I’ve tried to set up a password for the subscription I paid for- link doesn’t work.

I’m going to have to send an email to technical support just to cancel the subscription I signed up for. | Not user friendly! | After I bought the paid version, it works really well. The developer seems like he’s tired of hearing about how his free version doesn’t work. | Very difficult to figure out how to use. Haven’t programmed a trip yet?! | Can’t map a very common route | I was trying to figure out routes that can be taken driving across country and it’s not very good at explaining how the app works | It doesn’t know all zip codes when searching location by zip code only. And there is no option for crossing Houston except using the only toll road which is stupid, there are 100 ways to get across town without using that. Overall it’s a basic app | just downloaded this app and planning on deleting it right after this. it seems to do good things but not for free, the free version doesn’t save anything for you. basically if you want it buy the paid version | Why would an app ask you to review the second you download it ?

There response was feel free to hit the cancel button ??

Why ask for a review the second you download it | I haven’t the faintest idea of what this app does! | Deceptive way to force you to purchase. Should have allowed saving with few pins so that we can see how it works. Developer responses are just rude, lacks compassion to understand basic feedback | I’ve spent a lot of time searching for a trip planner, this one is beyond my expectations.
The tutorial is just the get started guide.

I’m traveling full time in our 5th wheel trailer. I downloaded this app after starting this seasons trip. Many of the features available were not in the tutorial but in the sample, so don’t forget to check it out. 
When entering dates and times I found the travel time was added in the data. 

One of the best parts in this app is the ability to edit the errors easily.

Bottom line I’m loving it! | I downloaded the app for the elevation feature that is advertised but foe the life of me I can’t figure out how to access it. I wrote to “support “ and all they did was refer me to the online help page which only says that the elevation chart is very handy but don’t show how to access it!
So far this app doesn’t appear to be what it claims. | Fails to advise you can’t save your trip unless you save. Bait and switch. | App doesn’t work. Help is non existent unless you join a google group, but the email address to join does not show in the directions. Created a .GPX on my computer (round trip from Ks to MA, with hotel, dates info). Tried opening file in RTP, brought in 25000 POI pins, didn’t recognize my route, no hotel info. Very dissatisfied. | Before you can even plan a trip, you have to buy the app unless you want unsaved edits. Total rip-off. | Nothing seems to work.

Can’t edit pin names 

Can’t share contacts | First let me say I’ve been using computers for a very long time and I can generally figure things out pretty quickly using the trial and error approach.  Appreciated being able to try a free version before buying the full version.  So I started with trial and error and soon realized that wasn’t working for me.  No problem, I’ll use the tutorial. Swiped through the examples and thought “cool” this is easy. So, started a pretend trip, which should have been pretty easy. Home to 2 poi to home.  Got the home in.  Even got the first location in.  Couldn’t figure out how to add the second location because the + sign wouldn’t come up again.  Back to the tutorial.  Went through that again.  Started over.  Same issues.  Played with it for about an hour or so and finally decided to move on.  

I agree with the person who commented about Streets and Trips, not because I’m looking to go back to a pc but for its functions and ease of use.  The developers snarky comment to a helpful suggestion from a customer told me all I needed to know. | Not clear how to use it to plot a trip | This has the potential of being a great app, but as is, its mostly just frustrating. I have yet to figure out how to delete a pin once it’s placed without deleting the entire file and starting all over. 
There also does not appear to be a search function in HELP.  If there is and I’m missing it, that’s just more evidence of being non-user friendly.  The developers would do themselves a huge favor to study Microsoft Streets and Trips for useful features and intuitive user interface. | Have not had the pleasure but hope this review gets me to the down load | I don’t see why this is any more useful than maps. There are no features that allow you to set a destination and plan a multi-day roadtrip, by setting the destination and adding legs of the journey while looking at the entire route and seeing pois on the way. You have to know where you want to stop ahead of time and that can be mapped with google or safari maps. Or maybe you can do that but it isn’t user friendly then. | Have to purchase | I have been using this app for a couple of years now. 24 National Parks and counting. I pick an ultimate destination and edit stopping points along the way. I try not to drive more then 3 to 4 hours between stop overs. This allows me to see the routes and time travels. I can insert new POI/destinations and edit the pins to reroute accordingly. I am not to techie,so probably don’t get the most out of apps? But I believe that free apps are just that and no one makes stuff for free. Always room for improvement, but time cost money and programmers aren’t free. | You will waste more money by wasting time with this app. Not worth it | I have not downloaded the app yet but reading the comments from the developers responses is entertaining. Not very customer service friendly responsive.someone gave a good review but the app developer reply’s with instructions. I am gonna try this app but mainly because the app developer response is entertaining. Lol BTW the excuse that nothing can be done about how Apple maps work is not valid as you can as a developer use your own mapping tools you don’t have to piggy back off apples map app that is a choice. Just FYI

Update:
So trying out the app so far found many issues with it. Even though this is a basic free version it should give you the ideal how the app functions. As I am gonna try it first before buying the full version. When searching a spot it doesn’t actually go to where your search is just the general area. Also the search list shows a list of places that match the search which is good however it’s pointless if you can’t scroll down and look through that list. Other things wrong with it is it isn’t user friendly. I am a tech guy and know my way around an app. I can see how people will have issue using it. This is not the case to be blamed on Apple as this is your App and you control how well it functions 100% app developer. It also does not seem to have a feature to plan the trip in advance as I see no option to adjust the date | Crappy app | This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen! Way too difficult | Downloaded and before I can even start they let you know that none of your entries or changes will be saved unless you purchase the “other app.” It’s a waste of time and a trap. I will buy another but not this one because it was initially misleading. Thanks but no thanks.

DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME | Not user friendly at all. | This app is dumb! Not user friendly- you think it’s complicated on the app go see the desk top version that btw you have to use to view anything on the app...... using this app is like playing poker in the dark with a group of 4 year olds | It's not free if you have to pay to make it work.

The map does not have much data. I downloaded the maps for the cities I am visiting, but most restaurants are not on the map. When I use it to navigate off line, it draws a straight line from point A to point B as if I’m a bird flying instead of walking on the streets. I don’t get it. | I bought Sygic Travel and paid the additional $29.99 to get Premium.  I am unable to mark 2 locations in Edinburgh so that I can see clearly how to get from my hotel to the location where a tour I am taking originated.  So I logged into my account online and all that comes up on the screen is a page called “Account overview” .  It tells me that I have no active subscriptions even though I purchased Sygic Travel Premium.  There is a help page on the website which tells me that with Sygic Travel Premium, using the mobile app on my phone I can unlock full place details, get walking directions and access itineraries, maps and guides offline.

I have none of that functionality with the mobile app.  They have online chat so I explained my problem and received a reply in chat that I would receive a response in five business days.  Appalling service.  This is a bait-and-switch app and I will never recommend this app to anyone who | I’m not going to write a long review or list pros and cons, just some things I don’t like about the app. 1) Route planning is god awful with no convenient ways to alter them. The route it chose for me to a particular destination was nearly 11 hours vs the 7 hours Sygic and Google routed. You do get transferred to the actual Sygic navigation app for GPS navigation but again that is inconvenient. 2) Even if it was just a summary I’d like to see my whole trips itinerary instead of just being able to see a single day. 3) I was going to send this note as feedback to them but their feedback email doesn’t allow you to actually SEND the email. 4) Finally, there have been no updates for over a year, which implies they don’t really care too much about it.  Maybe I don’t understand the app well enough but it’s looking like it was a waste of money. | This app is wonderful. One question. I know Sygic gps navigation does not require Wi-Fi of cellular. Could that be incorporated into Sygic Travel? | In 2016 we were traveling through California’s vast Anza Borrego dessert and lost cell signals. Scary! We found our way out and I looked for an app that would serve as an offline GPS, rather than adding a cumbersome Garmin device. After installing Sygic I literally could navigate anywhere without the need for a cell signal (other than initially downloading maps). 
     That was the start of my appreciation of the extraordinary value and features of Sygic! It continues to get better with more features  since 2016. We travel about half the year throughout the country in our Class B RV (Ford Transit camper van). Apple Car Play supports both Apple and Google maps, but Sygic through Car Play is our go-to navigation.  We depend on it and the features other navigation does not offer that are too extensive to list here. | Great app. Wonderful for creating day-by-day sightseeing itineraries, which is exactly what I was looking for. But 1 star deduction because it claims to support Family Sharing and yet doesn’t even show up I’m my subscriptions list, which makes it impossible to share. | When one doesn’t understand what it takes to develop an app, you get reviews like the ones who complain about its costs and features for premium version. I did not hesitate one second getting the premium version of this app, it has all-in-one what other apps offer separately or lack functionality. You get trip planning suggestions, tour suggestions and their cost, navigation help and instructions, all the information you need to plan your trip and a lot more! Honestly, this app is a gem and the developers really outdid the features and actually carefully selected what one user NEEDS and can get lots of advantage for. I cannot stress enough how awesome of an app this is. I just downloaded and needed to share my thoughts because I barely buy apps and let alone leave reviews but this one deserves every good review it gets. I applaud for the effort and thoughtfulness of making this app the most convenient one for trip planning I have seen in the app store. Thank you and I really hope you continue making it as awesome as it is and seamless to navigate. Two suggestions as an iPad user would be a calendar view to visualize trips in a calendar format (or calendar integration, which I am still exploring in the app) and an apple pencil/ draw format for note taking as it is easier for me to use but those two suggestions are just that, the app is awesome as is and has a lot of room for growth. | If you are not a premium user you are done this app will not provide any information for free. | I just downloaded the app and planned for my trips, the app is amazing (free version) however, for me as a traveller, I would like to know the admissions/fee of the attractions. Along with budgeted amount.

I would recommend to add this feature (even if for paid version) and it will be great app ever. | This had a few tourist sites listed.  Other than that, I find Gaia more useful:  Lots of map choices.  Tracks my location.  Routes easy to set up | I travel alot and this app paired with the sygic world maps premium package are great. Even if you have zero internet connection you have offline access. I used in at the Grand Canyon on a motorcycle ride and came in handy was not able to get my maps to work on google and sygic came thru gave me gas stations on the route etc and made it back in total darkness without any interruptions 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 | Wasted half a day fighting with this app trying to input a specific scenic day trip route.  Good for point a to point b routing but nothing more.  Waste of time and money imho. | I just paid for premium and it’s still trying to up-sell me.
No user info in login.
Definitely not intuitive!
Not having a good time! | This was so smart and easy and worked all through our trip - kept everything in order and got us everywhere in London & Paris! | We’ve been using Sygic travel app for a few years.  We are the do-it-all-by-ourselves crazy type who always try to squeeze as much as we can in the short time we managed to take off.  This app makes planning an itin so much easier.  We usually start off with reading various attractions both in app and online.  After we identify where we want to go, select what we want to do in each day and the app map out a logical route and give us an estimate of how long the itin will take.  Planning to go to the 50th country next. | I downloaded this and tried to set up a trip. I failed completely. Not intuitive at all. | I’ve tried a few and this one is by far the best. I love how it lets me schedule my day with walking distance (or car/train etc) being able to estimate my entire day. It also gives me the map on how to get there etc. I’ve used it in Italy, Greece, Turkey and now I just got done planning my France trip. I love it! | Keeps crashing, too few sort filters, way to slow, needs a complete overhaul ! | Been a premium user since 2016.  Been happy on most part.  Would like integration with CityMapper for public transportation routing so that I don’t need to exit this app and then to type in location in CityMapper.  The Visitacity free map already can do that. | I have been enjoying this App since the year 2015 or before.  I use it on my international trips, has never let me down. Thank you for this great app. | If you buy this you will only get support if you have the original receipt. Save that receipt, or don’t expect to ever have an issue. | I attempted to make a route using my iPhone, which was difficult. After reviewing, I see that you develop a route online, then save it (favorite) and it’s supposed to show in your App.   I do see the route on my iPad, but not my iPhone.  And, when I try to ‘share’ from my iPad, it shuts down/closes the App.   What gives????? | After the last update the app is not working I have perches some of options but it’s look like I’m losing money with your app after the update | It is a good basic app but to make it perfect developers need to:
- add lots of missed attractions.
- make country Templates “Road Trip”.
- make a list of top attractions as you zoom out. | من افضل برامج تلتنقل | Please Add Persian Support Language Like Official Sygic | Hi I am trying to make an app with the same concept but I’m going to focus on a small island only. How hard was it choosing between developers and may I ask how much it costed?
Thanks | This app is absolutely worthless!  To build an itinerary is painful. You first need to build it on a piece of paper because there is no editing. Even if you input the time for each site the app will not move the items in the correct order. You can not choose the mode of transportation between places. The app picks one for you. Basically zero flexibility with this thing. Very disappointed, now I’m sure it will be a pain to cancel the monthly subscription. | Everything has been working just fine and unjust wish there was a way of ticking or clicking done on the things I’ve already fulfilled on my list. | A waste of time, it's free to download and nothing else, I can't even try it because I have to pay. Deleted. | Trips from my group will not appear in my app. Only on the computer version which defeats the purpose. | Doesn’t allow you to create your own itineraries. | Great app especially putting a trip together on a computer but a total disappointment when coming to the app on an iPhone XS Max. Even when I’m in hotspots takes forever to go from one screen to the other and majority of the time it kicks me straight out. Doing a lot of travel to Europe the first couple times I used this app was slow but ok but my last trip to Cologne it was non functional period. | Nothing on this app works. I paid 4.99 for everything and I can’t even make an account. Can’t save anything. Everything I click just pops up with an error code. Terrible app I’d like a refund. | The search is terrible and you can’t find anything. When you try to search by street names it re directs you to a entirely different search. | It’s good improvement. 
thanks | Who is giving this thing good reviews??? It just freezes up. Totally unusable. But they got their $4 out of me and thats all that matters. | You have to pay to see anything | I was hoping it will work but it is complex and not worth the money.  I consider myself a tech savvy but got lost in the complexity.  Wish I could get the money back. | What good are the offline maps if the software is going to insist on attempting to provide a preview of the route using online data when sufficient data connection is not available. | This makes it so easy to find places to see, it lets you pick bubbles on the map and dig into reviews and other valuable information right there. Then adding an item to your itinerary is simple and you can start managing the days on the trip so you aren't doing too much or too little. | I used to plan to my trips using trip advisor, however they took away the ability to schedule items within each day of the trip. I tried using Google Trips, Tripline, and any other app that was recommended for trip planning. Sygic is the only one I have tried which had all the options I needed. Some of the features I appreciate include: being able to select multiple types of transportation for each day. If I am trying to plan a route on google maps for a day it won’t let me switch between using a car and using public transportation. Sygic let’s me decide for each destination whether I want to drive, take public, transportation, etc. The app also estimates based on the activities and routes how long of a day it will be. I used to manually estimate how long I would spend at each place I wanted to visit based on googles average for how long people spend there. Sygic automatically has an estimate for each travel site already. Also those times can be adjusted if needed. 
The premium feature of printing trips to PDF is also great. The PDF looks great and includes the travel guides for the cities you are visiting. 
Overall the app has everything I want from a trip planning app and I looking forward to continuing to use it for many more trips to come! | Wow off to Japan, and Asia. Out of all the app’s this one is way better the all others and I purchased five looking for something like this one. Thank you | Just started using this app and I like how easy it is to plan your itinerary out. Even share it. The biggest problem I have is being able to use my choice of navigation. I’d like to be able to use Google Maps or Apple maps for directions but it forces you to use their GPS solution, which then requires an additional purchase to get turn by turn directions!

Update: User error. Sygic actually uses Apple’s way of doing their settings so it wasn’t apparent to the user. Support is correct and you can change the default navigation app. Home Screen/Springboard > Settings > Sygic Travel. Amazing. The only issue I have is the app should walk you through an initial setup to get these things sorted out. With this fixed definitely an app I could recommend to others. Transferring my itinerary back to this now. Thank you! | Move an item from one day to the next, deletes any notes you had on that item. Pretty frustrating, for what would appear to be a rather simple programming task. | حسين من الكويت من عشاق السفر
شكسبير الكويت | I have been using this product in the last couple of weeks it has great features that you don't see them in other GPS applications. | مركز سعدون لصيانه الايفون | Loved Sygic for planning trips. Newest version lost all the tools and views I relied upon to plan my trips. How can I get the old version if the app back? Find the new version impossible to plan, arrange and time my day. | Be VERY careful. If you install you will be charged $25 to your Apple account without your approval.  Apple should take this down!

Just name the step the location you searched, like Grand Canyon should not be renamed to the county), then when you add photos the suggestions are always off and you have to manually look through photos. 

What it should do is look at your photos and suggest all the ones on that same date, even if they don’t have the geo location tag (DSLR photos). Entering in dates is also a pain, new step button for some reason always assumes you do it on a new day, so I have to go back and manually change that too. I’m sure if you use it to actively track new trips it works okay, but I’m frustrated with the experience of filling it in manually. It captured some of the trips I did in the past by analyzing my photos, but again renames all the locations to stuff nobody knows (it calls Muir Woods national monument by its county name) and will split trips into two sometimes, with no easy way to combine them. 

Features seem to be there but usability is lacking IMO, not really worth the effort (I did try a few other competitor apps and this is more features but still a pain). | Our daughter is traveling alone in SE Asia and this has been such a wonderful way for her to regularly update all close family and friends with photos, commentary, and maps all in one spot. | Can’t believe how well put together this is. I put in all my trips and it shows the pattern and rolls up all the statistics in a nice clean dashboard. It really is a marvel to behold. Best app I’ve come across in quite some time. | Let me drag and drop steps wherever I want, make the location search better by allowing actual addresses. And I can’t seem to change whether a distance is set to a flight or driving. Do better! | Useless app just collecting all the pictures from your gallery and pretending it to be a trip. Not user friendly at all | It so easy to journal your trip and keep all the love ones up to date. | I love the app but the UX is kinda not good for example I can’t search for a specific location in the guide section  i have to go back and forth google maps to see where it is located on the map , also in the search bar it says search people & place when it shows up it turns to trip , this is UX disaster. Overall make locations searchable | So fun to follow friends on their two-year adventure from Oregon to Antarctica and back - in their custom van! | Recently downloaded the app and was really happy with how it tracked my trip to remote areas in Antarctica.  However, as a whole, this app is frustrating and disappointing to me as a lifetime traveler.  To see it reflecting the sum total of my travels as 2% of the world is not only inaccurate but insulting.  The app should add a means to record lifetime travel or its usefulness is only in the moment during travel or as a means to look back only at recent travel.  

Adding a checklist of countries, cities or the like to capture a user’s full travel history would make it a more fulfilling experience as a user.  I do like how it uses location data from photos in the phone, that too is limited to relatively recent history. | Great app for allowing new puppy owners to track the travels of their new puppy in real time! | This app is simply brilliant! It’s a real journal of your travels, step by step. | I love this app. It’s so fun to see my journey develop over 4 years of travel and beyond | Since joining it has kept me current with my brother’s journey | I always enjoy traveling yet keeping up on these travels can be a bit challenging.  With Polorsteps, I can revisit my specific trip, exact places, comments and photos.  Additionally, I appreciate the ability to track all travel experiences across the globe.  Highly recommend | This is the number 1 app for travel. I can used for free, #1 #1. | I love polar steps and use it to keep a personal record of my overseas and at home travels. It’s easy to use and I really like the map feature. Highly recommend. | I absolutely love this app, I have been using it to track my travels for years now and it’s my favorite! It is so cool to go back and look at the maps it makes! | I absolutely love this app.  I have been tracking my trips - I don’t forget things and my friends can see my adventures! | I have been using polarsteps for about 7 weeks now to track my travels. I loved it at first and had no issues, however in the last few weeks I CONSTANTLY have issues uploading videos. I've tried uploading videos on wifi & data, it still comes up with an error though. Not sure I'll continue using it if this bug persits. | I use Polarsteps for all my travels - it's not just great to share your trip with friends and families, but also to keep your trip documented for later. It's an amazing memory and I love going back to past trips and see what we've been doing. But most importantly, the photobook which you can create is absolutely fantastic. The quality and the design are just perfect. I've ordered about 5 photobooks already and love them all! It is so easy and fast to create that you actually do it. Would 100% recommend!! | I’ve been traveling for a month and found out about this from a fellow traveler. It’s brilliant in concept but I cannot get it to track my current trip. It synced all of my trips from 7 years ago from my photos with all gps location details, and attached photos to those locations. But the point of me using it is for my current trip and it is just a blank slat. Does not import my photos, location, or dates at all. I’ve done everything I can think of, went into a deep dive in my iOS settings, went through the trip settings, my account settings, read through pretty much the ENTIRE help center, scoured Reddit, updated my phone, deleted my account and reinstalled it, restarted my phone etc and NOTHING WORKS!! It wants me to add everything manually down to the date I flew and the location I flew into and then the next place I stayed etc but at no point does it ever finally pick up in syncing to fill the info in. I ended the trips, restarted the trip, every thing I can possibly think of and NOTHING works. What is the point in using this for your friends and family to track your travels if it only syncs trip details after you arrive back home?!?! The only trips it syncs are ones where I’ve ended AND flown back to my home location. Otherwise this stupid thing is WORTHLESS and you might as well just post on social media because it will be endlessly less frustrating!!! | I documented a month long trip through Scotland after I returned home and the result was impressive. It would have been even better had I known about and used the app during the trip. The browser interface for sharing & viewing the trip works well; navigation would be aided if trip steps could be collapsed to a single line showing just the step name. A native iPad UI for the app would also be great as would a built-in airplay option. I could go on with feature requests but for a free app with no advertising Polarsteps shines as is. | we be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. | I have been using Polarsteps since its Beta phase and I love it. I like that my trip posts can be private or public. The app is easy to use. The book editing can be a little time consuming but the final product is of first rate quality. | Polarsteps is awesome!   I have used both the app & website versions for years and can’t say enough good things about them.  It just keeps getting better all the time.  

The team behind PolarSteps is committed to providing a seamless experience for everyone.  I recently encountered an issue, contacted them, and the problem was corrected quickly & perfectly.  

If you are considering PolarSteps, don’t hesitate to try it…..you won’t be disappointed! | Absolutely the best travel tracker app I’ve found. Best way to save all of the memories from your journeys and even convert them into a high quality photo book. | I have three trips that were taken years ago that still show I am traveling. I have tried numerous times to go in and change the end date. I have deleted the app. I am only working on my iPhone. I can’t understand why I can’t get it to end the trip. | Amazing app if you’re into traveling really easy to use. | We are | Great app which is intuitive, easy and highly functional, however the photo book process and options needs work…merger with Shutterfly or Mixbook(?) | I love this app and the concept of documenting your travel. I also love the idea of being able to make a book at the end. But the app is insanely glitchy!!! There have been several instances where I added all my photos and wrote out paragraphs of text, just for Polarsteps to delete parts of it after posting. For example, I just wrote out many paragraphs detailing a day of my trip, and polar steps deleted everything but the first couple sentences. There is no archive and no way of retrieving the lost text. Another time, I uploaded many photos and the app only actually uploaded one. I had to delete the step entirely and try again. 
Love this concept, PLEASE fix this app!!!!!! | I learned about Polarsteps from a fellow American I just happened to meet in Izmir, Turkey, and he told me he was using the app as his  travel blog, so I downloaded it and followed him. Actually, now that I think about it, I started using it that same day in 2018! And I never stopped. How do I remember such details? Because my experience is forever recorded in the app, complete with pictures, maps, and real time experiences. Polarsteps is so easy and intuitive, I have used it for every trip i’ve taken since then. At least 20-30 trips, many them abroad. It is so fun to go back through my past adventures and relive the details. Travel is something so special to me, and I want to remember everything I did, as well as keep my friends and family informed in real time. Polarsteps helps me so that. I highly recommend it. | I gotta tell you, PolarSteps is the bomb-diggity of travel apps! 🌍✈️ Seriously, it’s like having your personal travel guru right in your pocket. I’ve been on the app since the beginning and I’ve happily carried PolarSteps around the globe with me.

One thing that totally rocks about PolarSteps is their overall travel statistics. It’s like looking at your own travel résumé - you can see how many countries you’ve conquered, how many miles you’ve trekked, and even the time you’ve spent in transit (Jetsetter badge, anyone?). It’s perfect for impressing your friends with your travel street cred.

But wait, there’s more! The interactive global map is where the real magic happens. You can zoom in on the exact spots you’ve been, and it’s like reliving your adventures all over again. It’s like having a digital scrapbook that you can share with your peeps, complete with photos and notes.

Plus, the app is super user-friendly. You don’t have to be a tech whiz to navigate it. Whether you’re a seasoned globetrotter or just planning your first big trip, PolarSteps has got you covered. It’s the ultimate travel sidekick, and it’s all about making your journeys cooler than a polar bear’s toenails. 🐧❄️

So, if you’re into tracking your adventures and reliving the good times, PolarSteps is the way to go. It’s the app that turns your travels into epic stories. Happy adventuring, my fellow wanderlusters! 🌟🌏🌟 | Love this App! Wonderful to make a book of your trip! They do an awesome job making your book! | There is a bug where I cannot follow the trips that have been shared with me. When I click a friend’s link, it takes me to the app homepage. Even when I search for that person, it says they have no trips. It works fine on the web version so it must be an app issue. No way to contact support either. | Nice to see friends on their trips | Splendid app to track friends from all over the world as they travel! | I’d like to start off by saying that I absolutely love the step tracking features in this app. It’s like the perfect digital journal for my trips. There are just a few features that irk me when trying to use the newer features. I don’t understand why, if you can load predicted routes using roam to rio, we can’t just use the predicted route as an actual one in step tracking. I hate having to use the steps suggested when tracking is on, but the straight lines look sooo bad in the finished trip map. Why can’t I just say, “yes I took the exact route suggested by roam to rio, use that for the map”? The tracked steps are always random and sometimes skip major sections so it doesn’t follow our route.

 And I want to buy one of the travel books so badly because I spent so much time documenting my trip in this app that there’s no way I’m creating a book in another one, but the features to edit the layout are extremely limited. Only getting to fit 4 photos on a page with a 400 page limit is so hard! If I have a long trip or I want a more photos I’m unable to fit everything I want to show. I took a 2 month trip and was so excited to print the book only to realize that I’d have to pick like 4 photos for each step and they don’t fit onto the page very efficiently. I would gladly drop the $200 for a large travel book if I could actually control the page layouts.

Finally, is there any plan to incorporate the 3D globe that androids have for the iPhone app. I love being able to look at all the steps on the globe on my friends phones but it’s just a flat, non-interactive map on the iPhone. Again, I love the app and I use it all the time, I just wish it had a few more features to make documentation easier. | This is a wonderful app because it allows us as travelers to keep our family and friends abreast of our travels. It’s almost like they’re being there with us I would highly recommend it. | My family and I followed my daughter and her friends on PolarSteps as they traveled through Europe after college graduation. The graduates loved posting multiple photos on PolarSteps and journaling about their journey. They also felt more comfortable posting multiple photos on PolarSteps than on Instagram. | What a great way to record a trip. I tend to take a lot of pictures and I appreciate that I am not limited in what I post, nor am I limited in how much I choose to write. Unfortunately I cannot provide captions for specific pictures. 
Combining a live map of where we are at any specific time is fantastic.
I hope I can make their work worthwhile with picture books ordered after the trip. Great business model idea - I hope it pans out! | I have been using Polar Steps for more than 5 years and my Italy Trip on the app was ruined. The location services are always active and there has been internet access during the whole trip but my steps were not recorded. So basically day one and day 8, no exact routes or anything.

Thanks for that. | Whenever my friend goes on a trip I have the worst time signing in to follow. Get stuck in loop of new password not recognized. | been loving this app. makes keeping my friends and family so easy and fun. I do wish there was a feature where i could turn off the live location without going private or followers only just for safety reasons. | This app is something I have imagined before and wished existed. With a few UI thibgs and some other flow improvements this app could be near perfect in what it does and delivers. 

My only wish is that users were more in control of the privacy settings, and that there were more ways you could manage the way the data is stored and used. | The application give me the feeling to travel from my house in the USA with my family in Europe.  I can follow them through the countries and beautiful photos they take. Thank you | Love keeping up with my granddaughter🙃 | We just came back from a one month trip. We used Polarsteps and shared with our friends. They all said it’s fantastic. They read every what we wrote at every stop and the pictures we posted from different places. It’s a good thing to remain for us as a fond memory and a travel log. We may review those pleasant experiences at any time.

Just unbelievably wasteful | We need an iPad version | Reservation showed up a day later in the app, baggage claim info showed up 3 hours after the flight has arrived.

Whether it’s airlines, hotels, or rental car companies, they all have their own mobile app that allows me to contact them directly, not sure why I need this app… | Not sure is this is an app problem, or an iPhone problem. But when I fill an address to select a car rental agency, clicking “Select location” button on the app does nothing. It could even be an SAP concur issue. I don’t know. But this is a massive pain | My previous issue was resolved with help from support. Leaving at 4 stars due to the initial occurrence. | Why do I need an App if I have to log in using my computer!! Feels ridiculous | Waisted an hour of my life trying to get logged into the app. If I can’t reliably access the app, I will never be able to rely on it during travel. | Unfortunately my company partners with BCD for travel arrangements. The app is just laughably bad and has been that way for YEARS. It resets the search whenever you cycle between apps, so you’d better have all your details straight before you try to book a trip. It requires you to select a time of day for your flight, but no matter what you select it shows every single option anyway. There are many other examples. Who at BCD uses this app and thinks it’s a good experience? Incredibly frustrating. | App no longer works.  Always reports that its unconnected and can’t retrieve data.   Been a problem for several weeks.   Uninstalled and installed again.  No fix. | Registered the app and validated that credentials work with website, but app won’t get past the login screen on both my iPad and iPhone. Contacted support, who noted my website login and ignored that the ticket clearly stated that the app didn’t work. Buggy app and poor support. Website looked useful, however. | It does nothing???  Really? | This app isn’t all that great when poop hits the fan and you need quick access to your travel info. I keep having to sign in to be able to see anything. It’s quicker just to use disparate apps at this point. | Being interrupted during normal sleeping hours is inappropriate, especially for a flight two days out. No one likes to be woken up at 2200 hours, especially when one is sleeping or trying to fall asleep!!! | Now the the app Forces me to ‘update’ at the airport-right when I need my information the most. When I open the app I want it to work. An Update should be at my request! I don’t expect TripSource to be like the DMV by imparting policy. I never had a problem the past w/o updating, but I guess the developers showed me. | My company (Network Television) started using this app for us to book our air travel. It is so frustrating to use. You would think it was designed by someone who builds government apps. I had to use a stylus, a lot of the buttons (time of departure) etc don’t work and since u have to constantly zoom in to input data it’s always asking if you want to leave the app. None of my co workers like it either.  
The real problem with it is they ported a website to an IOS app. It would be fine if you could use it on a laptop (which we can’t) but doing it on a phone is brutal. If the developer would ever use it to book a flight on their phone they would rebuild it immediately | It’s been many months now since my job switched to this app. Since then it’s worked exactly 1 time for me. If I’m able to even browse hotels and get as far as picking one, whenever I try to book I get a “it’s not you it’s us” message and to try again. I’ve rebooted, uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared app data and everything else I could think of. I’ve even changed phones but it still acts the same. Garbage. | Your FAQ indicates that you can add your flight itinerary to iCal using the app. No you can’t. You removed that option in this version. | With the latest update, I don’t see any flights or hotels.  It says nothing is there.  ? | This app’s previous version worked great but this new version has issues updating information during a trip. It doesn’t terminal, gate and baggage claim information correctly like it used to before in previous version. Importing externally booked trip details has now become cumbersome. It adds imported trips into existing or previous trips book through BCD travel. It does not recognize logical dates of booking when year details in booking is not provided. For example, when trip commences in Dec 2019 and ends in Jan 2020 and the year details are not given booking, it would show the booking as starting on Jan 2019 and ending in Dec 2019. I don’t think I can use this apps anymore. I wish you could go back to the previous version that worked correctly. | App functions ok but the new UX is a major step backward.  I’m sure it looks good on screen shots but harder to navigate. | Redesign makes this very hard to follow, and disorganized. No idea why they took the clear cards, and make it a mess of dots and giant titles and confusing layout | Latest update took this app back in time.  No apparent way to set up and data and use Touch ID, which just came to last version of app recently. | I never get worked up enough to write a review, but the latest update has ruined this app. It is buggy and unusable to the point that I stopped and booked a hotel room through my company travel website instead for the first time ever since getting this app. 

Someone probably needs to get on that. | It no longer seems to have this feature. It’s recent update makes this nearly worthless. | Great agents and excellent customer service always.
Thank you for being helpful and assisting with all my flights | I find the new update very confusing. I used to use the app for preferred seating upgrades and I can’t find that anymore! | Received notification to download newest update. Now app won’t open. Keep getting server is down message. | Super intuitive and easy to use! This app is a life saver on my work trips! Thankful for the great look, feel, & functionality. | Very resilient and reliable. Enjoying using this application. Ruslan | It is so frustrating that a business app doesn’t have a saved login - or if it does, isn’t working correctly. Viewing trips should be quick and seamless. 

There’s a lot to be desired of this app. It doesn’t handle multiple legs of trips very well. If part of a journey is complete but not another portion, it shows the trip as in the past. 

For one of my hotels, the pin on the map was wrong and showed it in a city an hour away from where I booked it, nearly causing a panic. The address booked was correct though. 

When it comes time to check into a flight, or at any point you want to review/edit a flight, there’s no way to click through from an itinerary to an airline site which is quite frustrating. | Very difficult to add information, screens are not user friendly
Can not navigate between screens to add information | The app has all of my travel info needs integrated nicely with my IPhone. | Very slow app | Clean interface, integrated hotel booking...which is incredibly convenient.  I receive messages from TripSource before I get them from the carriers.

Well done. | I use this app and love having my trip info organized in one folder. It makes it easy to find locator numbers to check in ... except when it doesn’t download the Locator number, flight, or gate info. For some reason when I travel on Southwest the folder will show trip and cities but not all the details you need to know. It’s really a pain to go through having to go find your locator number; especially if your company makes your travel plans for you. Most of the time I can then load my Mobil boarding pass in my Apple wallet but today it wouldn’t do that. Just sometimes not reliable . If they fix this I would give a very strong 5 stars. | TripSource keeps all my reservations in one spot, which is great! I wish it could help me select a motel based on the proximity of my destination. I’d love to be able to enter an address and have it show me motels, distances, and reservation costs. | App is not very good.  Tried to load loyalty programs and unable to load any airline programs. | Where is outlook invitation capability?  You would not let me submit with 3 stars so try 4 | I wish our actual electronic tickets were part of the itinerary.  That would save from having to use multiple apps.  Also, when emailing the itinerary to others, we should be able to write a note with it. | This was a great app until a recent update changed the login policy. Now I have to type a password after 30 mins of inactivity. That’s nuts when my MDM solution forces a complex password for the phone and allows for remote wipe. Very disappointed. | Password, security getting too intense and making app unwieldy | Trip Source AP was very useful and accurate while traveling. My bags were late coming into my destination due to an airline error and Trip Source sent me notification long before the airline. 
Very impressed!! | The app is generally good, but the new login screen no longer allows pasting in the password field, nor does it have any password manager integration. This is quite frustrating for users that use password managers and are unable to paste in their long, complex passwords. | Please make the app so it rotates for an iPad | All of my trips say ‘Your trip to Bloomington, IN is ready to view.’ None of my trips have been there. Just kind of annoying. | Would be a great app IF I could remove past trips.  The app is helpful on alerting others, keeping you updated on travel updates however when the trip is done, I want to remove the trip from my iPhone-so far I haven’t heard back from the app help desk.  

I’ve deleted the app. | Need to login each time you open the app now. While I expect that level of security for a banking app, it’s unusual for a travel app. TripIt doesn’t do this. What’s worse is their customer service - customer care and tact certainly aren’t high priorities for them. | I love(d) this app but this new forced log on “feature” every 30 minutes might just force me to remove it. It’s ridiculous to type in a password so often while on travel..
Please make this an option. | I’m finding the info concerning my trips is lacking. For example, I cannot find my flight confirmation number anywhere in the app. That info is literally the one piece of info you need to fly, why would you not include in the flight info? | The hotel reservations in the app has not been working.

I’ll try my PC but this leaves a bad taste in my mouth. | I tried to sing up for an account and the app keeps deleting the last digit of my number.. pathetic app | After multiple attempts over three days, a supremely negative review is warranted. After logging in to attempt a seat assignment thru this app, the best I get is a blank white screen. 
Trying VietJet’s app for “other airline” compounds the frustration since no reference number supplied by either airline will retrieve my online booking . 
Instead of AirAsiaMove, I’ll choose Bangkok Air henceforth. | I am totally disappointed with ur Mobile app. I have filed the complaint many times and it’s over a month and still it’s not fixed. I guess the Management is sleeping n dnt care about the customers. I dnt recommend to anyone with so poor service. | The so called “modify booking” function does not work. It allows you to select the new flight then the “continue” button promptly turns grey. I was told by the “support staff” that the only way to modify the booking is to actually travel all the way to the airport of departure and talk to sales staff who couldn’t care less. I was told to talk to the “chat box”. Absolute rubbish. | The worse app I ever downloaded by for! Can’t check in online because the app can’t find my reservation even a the reservation code and name was correct! Can register because the number shows up when doing the phone verification, it always missing one digit! I tried multiple times and the issue was still the same! | Wanted to look up a flight. Open the app it says I have to download the app update, so I updated. When to flight search screen, and where I type in where I am flying “from” and “to” I cannot type anything because there is no keypad to type anything. It is not possible to fill in the blank 😆 so I am canceling my membership and deleting the app altogether. | App crashed continuously while I’m trying to go through passport and ticket check. Very poor performance, slow and buggy. | I created a profile with my USA phone number but the app deleted a digit so I am unable to verify my telephone through text. Please fix. I am trying to buy a flight.  Thank you. | Most features don’t work, or don’t load any information. Why even bother with an app if you can make it work. Seems mostly focused on up-selling primarily useless products and promotions. | I tried to book this flight yesterday for $165 and could not get it to go in could not receive SMS so today it cost $188 for the same flight and I spent two hours. I had to re-enter data credit card several times not happy. | Really really useless app. The website instructs to download the app to get live chat support but the app use the same chat bot as the website. The bot couldn’t understand most commands and request for human, live agent, people, customer support all return the same “I can help you faster” message. Exactly the level of poor service you expect from a Malay airline | This app is so bad that I must leave a review. They don’t even have real humans. I wish their chat bot ‘Bo’ didn’t exist, it is actually the most infuriating thing I’ve ever seen. Hopefully this company goes bankrupt. | So I am leaving in a week from the United States to the Philippines and I got a text today that said I should download the app and login there for my flight information. I downloaded the app and upon signing in and creating the login with my iPhone, it asks for date of birth and country dialing code as well as your mobile number. The mobile number is seven digits plus the area code for a total of 10 but every time I go in and try to register my cell phone to get a code sent to me. It says invalid number, because it leaves the sixth digit out after clicking next. I have tried it 100 different times and downloaded the app all over again after deleting it, and even restarted my phone, but nothing I do helps. This app is unusable for me and I don’t know who to contact to even get support. | New review:

New update reminded me that I still have this app on my phone 4 years later. Still a terrible app. Not formatted for an iPhone 13 Pro. No dark mode. Don’t need it and won’t be using it any time soon. Will be deleting it.

Old review:

Soon after entering my phone number into profile , I started getting group texts from random emails. Email texts contained links to scam sites. Their data bank is hacked. | The OTP system does not send the numbers to my email and I am unable to log into my account. The system is not upgraded but flawed. | Just downloaded the new app….the site froze as I was updating my telephone number. Check my WiFi, all good. Tried numerous times to input the
number. No chance to make a reservation. 😡 | Moving away from company branding is not smart move. I almost deleted this app as I did not recognise when I ever downloaded the app. Not to mention that functionality is just bloated. I never expect to use this app other than booking a flight. For hotel and other services I would have looked elsewhere. All I need is just flight detail and checkin. Please deliver only that. Do not force feed your customers. | So frustrating!
Force you to sign up but the app does not accept any phone number | Worst airline customer service on earth. In the history of earth. I’ve been locked out of my account for 3 months and all they can tell me is why. I know why but only they can fix it. And it goes on and on and on. | It would not take my password or accept a new one either. I spent 2 hours screwing with it on my phone and on the computer. Their tech has gotten much worse!!! | Any time I try to create an account or login with my existing one, I’m required to verify my phone number - an expensive requirement when traveling outside one’s home country - but the verification prompt for some reason deletes the third digit of my phone number every time (at least displays as such) and, perhaps consequently, I’ve never successfully received the OTP text | Worst App Ive had to deal with! | Apparently airasia is able to aver charge you in any flight once you change from booking details to payment method with the app/page (my case was 4 min to fill out both).
They haven’t disclosed any details about the extra amount deducted from my account after booking my flight, on the ticket (receipt) received by airasia indicates a different amount than the one charged to my card.
The costumer service assured that they are able to do that due the time difference in between booking details and payment method. They have also mentioned that I can check on the breakdown of the price to know extra fees, which I have but I doesn’t mention anywhere the excess charged to me, and I either received a email to clarify this. | I don’t like this airline becauseee:
- they charge for every bag they can
- they force you to check in at baggage drop counter instead of online 
- not that polite 
- slow line | Keeps messing up my phone # and won’t let me change to verify. Won’t let me change my flight and doesn’t save my flight. Too many pop ups. Not gonna use this airline again | good ride | When I buy tickets by app , I can’t  transfer k plus bank | It’s a great idea to create competition but 9.5/10 times I try to book a car (Penang) they cannot find a driver. Believe it or not sometimes I even stupidly wait to find a car even after 30-40 minutes. | I tried to leave feedback on the app. But the submit button doesn’t work! Which is infuriating because I have a big complaint. Also, when I tried to contact customer support I get sent to “Bo” a really bad AI program. | I have tried to complete my profile to use the app but cannot get past the first hurdle due to a glitch in the app. When I fill in my phone number, it has a 1 in the 3rd to last number of a 10 number string. When try to verify the number using an OTP, the OTP request screen which captures your number from your profile doesn’t register the 1. I have tried inserting other numbers in the space and it works. Only 1 doesn’t but it means I cannot verify my number and this cannot get into the app at all. Incredibly frustrating. | The service was good and good price. In Malaysia we used the ride and the service was really good and good price. | Cannot verify a USA phone number in the App.  the app drops a digit out of the phone number, so the OTP cannot be sent.  This is a BUG.  The Website is able to send the OTP | - I have booked SNAP but when I went to hotel, they said no booking.
- Customer service difficult to contact and reply to late. Waste time to wait them.
- CS just said ‘Sorry’ this cost only flight.
SNAP showed me so clearly, I will have flight+hotel. 
And finally they have no responsibility.

- Every time opened the application have to update but Nothing improve in the application.

Should be improve your service first, no need for application. 😡💀 | The form truncates your phone number so you never receive the OTP | Booked flight online and never received ticket. No, Customer Service responded!! I tried for 24 hours to contact customer service multiple ways. Never receive response never was told if I need to re-purchase ticket or if the ticket was available at airport. Very frustrating!
Does not provide the information needed
No way to contact Customer Service!
Bookings do not show up under “my bookings”… Customer Service does not know how to fix for me. | This does not let me sign in and put my phone number | When i use app, it comes up with a mandatory screen to update my profile.  The phone number is valid.  When i click to verify phone number it drops the last digit and then says its an invalid number.  I cant get out of this loop to actually use app to check flight status. Not good. | I’ve had to enter my details into the app several times. I also wanna warn you that if you’re catching your flight at DMK, the line is so long to check in and drop your bag and then you’ve got about 1 km to get through security to gate 12. It takes 30 minutes and all the way you’re trave there though threatening to close the door on you | I filled out my profile too quickly, and didn’t switch the gender from male to female. Now I can’t edit it. Even if I open my profile on their website and change it to female, the save button is greyed out and I can’t save my changes. Their chat bot Bo won’t help me with it, and there’s no way to contact anyone for help.",4.40848,15374,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/3d/37/91/3d3791cb-e053-2a1d-6fdb-bb1dc54136e2/bef64666-e773-4b8f-80de-e00654a5ae45_AS-1242x2208_EN-01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/d2/c2/1e/d2c21e97-a626-7a2a-2b21-feebbcf4e22e/51fdcc76-b9fc-4825-84d1-f5109b1c5f6d_AS-1242x2208_EN-02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/67/db/5f/67db5f18-6418-9728-10d2-bc1248e6f981/243a5bab-7679-43f6-8018-5e8cb727840d_AS-1242x2208_EN-03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/8b/bf/af/8bbfaf34-9a25-d651-0d4f-9de4043ab66a/2c12cb20-09b4-4fba-927c-873c2bdac91b_AS-1242x2208_EN-04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/0b/32/cf/0b32cfea-2a85-365b-bb9b-bb3aeebe64d9/4c63cb12-fcb4-4a62-aafb-b6c4fff36a9f_AS-1242x2208_EN-05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/8d/e4/90/8de4907a-d128-7c59-eaa1-0767b3e8dbf9/59c1a0ba-5d34-4e86-9df9-67e8ed1de0ae_AS-1242x2208_EN-08.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/eb/18/af/eb18af01-922a-d9d7-5b59-8dab1eeeaad7/ae46d121-4e98-4e8b-8101-7c5b6812a5cb_AS-1242x2208_EN-07.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/c7/79/f3/c779f30a-c07f-d7ef-30ee-209b13ad924c/dff07df3-7d08-42fa-9802-9bd5581d769b_AS-1242x2208_EN-06.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Couldn’t navigate back to the Home Screen after signing up. Lost me 2 minutes  ✌🏻 | It asks me what city I am in, so I type it, London, and it doesn’t work (no results). So I type several cities in America, still nothing. I type in Dubai, Tokyo, Rome, Paris and more and still “no results.” It’s sad because this looks like a good app | At first I thought I was imagining things, but I tested it with a few specific restaurants and monitored whether or not they disappeared over time. A bunch of my restaurants are gone from my map, which defeats the entire purpose of the app. switching to Beli. | Love the app but even after several exchanges with developer still cannot edit locations that do not have an address which are the majority of my 1k locations (waterfalls, trailheads, kayaking river access points) … | I found the interface very confusing when I tried to skip entering my phone number. After a bad review and multiple developer follow ups, I finally found how to skip it. I still think it should be more clear. Update: My one star review is because of the interface regarding entering my phone number which I found to be confusing. The screen has a blue circle with a white phone at the top and a big empty field which says “What’s your phone number?” and way down at the bottom of the screen it says “Show My Friends” This interface is bad because in the previous screens I was asked for my preferences, and I was asked to share my contacts, which I declined. These screens had a very helpful “Later” button which gave me a clear way to skip. But this last screen that asks for phone number did NOT have a “Later” button. So it switched interface paradigms near the end of the process after setting up my expectation that I could skip with a “Later” button. So I assumed if I tapped “Show My Friends” it would tell me the phone number field was required. I am the user. I found it confusing. I am entitled to give a one star review for an app that I found hard to use. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would. I might reconsider if they make the screen more clear and add a “Later” or a “Skip” button to that phone number screen. Otherwise, my review is one star and I gave it because in my opinion the interface of the app was confusing to me when I wanted to skip entering my phone number. Also, since I did not share my contacts or enter my phone number, it makes no sense to have a button labeled “Show My Friends.” My intention was to use this app as a way to bookmark cool places I have been. Nothing to do with friends. Which again, think about how confusing the interface is: I did not share contacts or enter a number, and now the only button I was given was “Show My Friends.” It makes no sense. Especially as a new user, I am expecting a “Show the Map” button or something like that. As I said: I found this interface to be confusing. | I absolutely love the idea of this app, I’ve had it for awhile but every time I try to open it I have to “reconnect” it to my Facebook account and 75% of the time it just won’t reconnect and I can’t pull up my maps. 

So many bugs that need to be fixed that have been occurring over the last 5+ months. | Perfect way to organize all my favorite spots without cluttering my driving maps.  Can’t recommend enough!! | I absolutely love mapstr whenever I have a day off I love to go explore news places right in my own backyard! Or if I am coincidentally in the area of a place I’ve marked I always try to make a stop, thanks to alerts that you can set. I could rave Al day about the customization of this app truly but, I did come here to say 2 things, one, that I wish there was a function where you could pin something and it would recommend you others like it or things others near that location have pinned! I think it would be a great addition because sometimes place really are hidden. Two maybe having a toggle function where you could see reviews for the place you’ve pinned if you wanted. I love having my own personal map but sometimes for places I haven’t been a review would be helpful. I understand that’s what the internet is for but having it streamlined into one place is just a little more convenient. I love this app with all my heart and regardless of what I think I will continue to use it forever :) | The app logs me off and tries to get me to establish a new account every time I open it.  No one has the time for that, no matter how useful a new app may be and even if they love the concept… | I just want to say that you guys did a great job with this app. For several years now I’ve been keeping everything in my notes, but this is clearly superior. I have one improvement that can be made since I saw another app do it. I like the tags feature, but you can make it so that we can modify the order that they are shown in on our list? I think it would be nice for aesthetic purposes. Because that way my tags can all be in the same order down the list without me having to delete and re add them in order every time. | I’ve been using Mapster for a number of years. I travel a lot for business and I would store restaurants and other places for reference for when I’m on a trip and seek a restaurant or tourist spot I have saved in the area. 
It is probably user error but as the app has evolved, my ability to find saved items where I’m at, or search for places I’ve stored, but don’t recall exactly what they are called, has become an exercise in frustration for me. I really liked it as a reference library of my places, I’m not really interested in the social media aspects. | I just wish the app was more offline/offgrid friendly. Or at least have the ability to toggle a button to turn on/save for offline use. The app will not open if I have no signal/wifi. And sometimes I can get it to work offline if I stick my phone in airplane mode (50-50 chance). Other than that, it’s a pretty swell app. | I have used this app on several trips. The ability to map sites of interest is such an excellent idea and tool for travel. However, you cannot retain or add maps. If there is an ability to add additional maps then I could not determine how. | When I first found Mapstr about three years ago I recommended it to many of my friends out of my excitement with what it was then and hopes for its future. Unfortunately, the app seems to me to have been on a fairly constant trajectory towards feature bloat that has made the core experience harder to use and appears to have degraded performance.

I wish the tremendous effort that it must have taken to convert this app to a social network would have been instead directed to making improvements to the UX of the core experience of adding and viewing places. Specifically the biggest issue to me is content density: there is lots of whitespace in the UI, there is much less information displayed about a place than in other map apps (so that I have never been able to meaningfully rely on Mapstr for this info), and many touch targets are too small by modern standards. Also important to me is performance, especially on app launch, which is unfortunately much slower than other apps (and often banners appear which further distract from accessing the map quickly).

On the social side, I would have been quite happy with the simple ability to share lists/categories/map via link, and no concept of “friends” whatsoever.

HOWEVER, I have a lot of respect for the developer, which seems to be a really small team, possibly just one engineer. Persevering with a project like this, where your competition is all massive companies, for as long as you have (without selling out!) is impressive and commendable. I still think Mapstr has potential if the development focus can be returned to the core experience. | Mapstr is by far my favorite utility app. I love recommending others use it because if they don’t have mapstr then they aren’t able to remember all of the cool places they hear about to visit, especially in our home city, Chicago. | The app is nice itself, just wish they didn’t sell your data. Now I get random creepy emails from the CEO of this app asking me to verify my email address over and over again and junk emails addressed to my burner handle (which I created especially for this app), so I know it was them who sold it to the scammers. So annoying. | This app is a great for keeping track of all the places you want to save. However, I would really like the option to use it on an iPad. Developers: can you please update this app so it can fit on a larger full screen display? | This app used to be fantastic but the recent changes to it have been fairly detrimental 
Firstly when I open the app I don’t want/care about a news page, everyone is clearly only using it for the map section 
Secondly the performance has taken a hit recently, I used to be able to speed through different saved places but now there is a second lag when selecting/deselecting places
The centre arrow button… hitting that should always just centre on your location, move the ‘centre elsewhere’ button somewhere separate 
Basically I used to love this app and recommend to everyone because it was so smooth and easy to use and had such a clean interface, it’s not the same anymore | Good luck mapstr | I’ve been using this app for years as my way to keep track of bars and restaurants and I think it’s the best way to do it. But it keeps getting more and more bloated every time they add “features” that distract from its main purpose which is a map app. I don’t need prompts, recommendations, and lists. I just want to have a directory of my favorite places. | No matter what I do it won’t let me get past the sign up or sign in process, it asks me if I want to follow a list of people and then it starts to load the map and then crashes. I have not been able to use the app. | Hey guys, love the app but if I can make a suggestion, it would be so useful to see the names of the places we added on the map without having to click on the tiles which can be slow and inefficient. Would be great to be able to eyeball all the names.

Thank you!
Matthieu | Used this app throughout Spain and France and it was great to keep track of all the placed we wanted to go and learn from others what to check out.  Hate using it on the phone though.  When will the tablet format come out? | Just got the app and the first place I added shows the correct address on the listing, but shows up in the wrong place (a few miles away) in the map. I added a couple more that seemed to be accurate. But by the 7th one, the opposite error, is shows up in the right place on the map, but has the wrong address (completely different state this time) and even name of the restaurant wrong.

Seems like a cool idea for an app, but I haven’t even added 10 things yet and I’ve already run into two big errors with their database. I reported the errors to Mapstr through their app, so we’ll see if they get fixed, but that many problems right off the bat doesn’t bode well. | I have iPhone 12 Pro Max with latest iOS and am currently in Singapore. I love this app a lot and it’s exactly what I want except the gps doesn’t work. The precise location doesn’t work either and doesn’t notify me when I’m nearby even though I enabled it. The support couldn’t resolve this. Such a pity because this would be great in singapore and Asia but I can’t recommend it if the main feature doesn’t work here. The company should really look into it. | I’ve tried several apps that were meant to serve the same purpose, but each was always lacking something. THIS ONE IS PERFECT! They cover all the bases. | Great interface, but EXTREMELY buggy. Expect the app to freeze about twice for every one time that it works properly. | Another app that forces you to create an account so they can get your email or facebook info, as well as your travel wants and history. All I want to do is make sense of the hundreds of places Ive been. Simple. An account should be a choice. | Crashes when opening the app | Love the app! Please please just add the following 
1. Ability to rate each location 
2. Ability to add dollar signs of cost | Please explain why my account that I have used for years, was erased. | I love this app! I’ve been using it to keep track of places I want to visit all over the world. It’s awesome. Super easy to use and fully functional. Great dev as well. I have two suggestions: a colorblind mode and a tip option. The tags get very difficult to read if you’re colorblind. And, for people that really don’t need premium features, it’s be nice to be able to support the development with a tip now and again. | Use it all the time for recommendations, places I see and want to try, and places I want to remember in NYC | The map and places tracking tool is way better than any other app out there now for simplicity and ease of use. 
EXCEPT. That no matter what I do, restart, update software, delete, redownload, it always slows down all apps on my phone. Not just this app, its not only warping time in its own world, but it slows down everything on my entire phone until I close it several times.
These bugs are going to ruin it for me! So disappointed, I even emailed about it and never got a response. | I’m so glad my boyfriend introduced me to this app. I love being able to look back at places I’ve all visited, notes about what we ate, and to see other places nearby. | I love this app - I especially like the way it allows me to track locations that I want to remember to visit the next time I am traveling to a location, or even to keep track of cool spots and highly-rated restaurants in my hometown, with tags and/or “you are nearby alerts” to help me find them when I finally get around to checking them out. Highly recommend! | I have been searching for years of a way to keep track of the fabulous food scene of Chicago.  Mapstr is the best app to do that. Tagging by neighborhood, cuisine, chef, great rooftop etc etc has been super helpful for me to be able to easily pull up great options that meet my criteria. Many friends and family contact me because they know I’ll have great recommendations on where they should go because of mapstr. I love how there’s now more room for a restaurant description. More detail has helped so much! I also love that I can include links to online articles about the place so I can easily find more info. Super excited to continue to add more locations to my mapstr!! | I know there is a social aspect to this app, but I really use it to keep track of places I want to go in cities I’m exploring. For that, it’s perfect. The only thing I don’t like is that you have to tag everything, but that’s not a big deal because it forced me to be a little more organized in my locations. | Mapstr is the second app I use the most, right after Instagram. I use it in my hometown or when I travel, I store my own spots or look for new ones to discover. Couldn’t recommend it more!! | It’s just perfect. A clean, simple way to track and remember places I want to visit or have already been and loved. | I love Mapstr, it is so useful in my everyday life! Very easy to use and so practical! Being able to add tags to every places you save on the app makes it super customizable and practical. I no longer have 100 notes on my phone with restaurants ideas my friends talked to me about or that I saw a month ago in a magazine: all these places are on my Mapstr, ready to be tried! Also, being able to take inspos on my friend’s maps is what makes it much better than any other app! 
Really love it! Recommend ++ | Great app to save all your best places in one place. I’ve been using it daily for more than one year and the app works very well! | My only regret is not having this app 10 years to keep and share my favorites addresses | I love Mapstr and have been using it for a few years now. Maps are important to me when I travel and having this app suits my way of organizing the things I read or hear about that I want to visit. It’s also handy in LA where I live, since there are cool things to see and eat in many neighborhoods that may be off my beaten path. In Paris last fall I was able to easily see places that I had been plugging in rather than going thru a folder full of old clippings and then not knowing where they were, my previous method of saving good ideas. Very useful! | I love this app, it’s how I keep track of all the restaurants I have visited and want to try. I highly recommend it! | Love this app! Using it all the time! How to get reviews from people you trust instead of strangers... | For anyone serious about exploring (read: people who are both curious and organized), you can do no better than Mapstr. | I love Mapstr. I love to travel and use a map to help me plan and navigate trips. Mapstr allows me to save the places that I’ve been and reference them as I go. You can share your map with friends or keep it to yourself as you travel over time. Very simple to use and easy to understand. | When I find a new venue to visit or get a recommendation, Mapstr is the way I keep track. My favorite is going to a neighborhood I’m not typically in and looking at the spots I’ve marked. Easiest way to keep the adventures flowing. | This app was recommended to me by a French friend a few years ago. I love it!

1. It’s great for those times you walk past restaurants and think I’d like to try that but then you always forget. This way you can just save straight into the app

2. You can save places you’ve been so you don’t forget them. Especially for holiday destinations 

3. You can share with friends who ask you for recommendations and the tagging system helps localize their preferences

It works perfectly",4.75338,1403,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/5a/3c/02/5a3c027c-d2cf-6942-6190-584d9f6a5ce6/a8c131ed-9cb1-4e9e-95c0-0f26e4e915e7_visual01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/53/8b/f8/538bf8f5-65b8-b0b9-ed03-9de68b7f46ad/2fde34ac-da1a-4f28-a456-5b10fdfac6c9_visual02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/1d/ec/a4/1deca462-d187-4e19-915f-1b588c29dbae/da719077-1edd-4f9b-b0fc-130bc999e75c_visual03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/46/a1/bd/46a1bd3e-a560-a8c5-e6b8-313769ca78b8/afd9619e-f12b-4bd7-954e-56131e0ab8e1_visual04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/1c/13/9e/1c139e9c-b12a-457c-50fa-3bc444352997/b5a5517c-0bed-478e-ae72-b0b395c0d9c2_visual05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/c4/0a/65/c40a6505-8c6c-a660-9880-423abddd034a/94559555-8eca-4d57-9fba-fe9aedde6594_visual06.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/d1/c2/b9/d1c2b941-ea00-81d0-4de1-48f73042b9e8/c1282e3a-dd96-46e7-82d0-27cbf99ddb81_visual07.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/04/70/4e/04704e54-ceb0-c3ca-666b-a0a72d2f975e/84ae9ccc-c563-496d-b77c-cd0d78359801_visual08.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/ca/cd/91/cacd913f-b429-81aa-098d-0c1fdeb26161/18c8d874-46dd-473a-b6f3-795cb608c728_visual09.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

A few improvements though. First, when you search for places for your plan, the result doesn’t narrow down to your destination. Instead, it will display all the places with similar names in the entire world. When I plan for my trip to Paris, why would I want to see places in Australia and Canada?

Second, management of sub groups within a trip would be great. For example, allow creating trip to Paris and Berlin and Rome under a larger plan called Trip to Europe. And then allow forwarding of reservation emails to the Trip to Europe plan for automatic imports. Thanks. | Would love to see the document section incorporate actual word and excel documents...odd that it doesn’t support that.

Notifications could be more specific...pretty generic at the moment.

Would love to see hiking/camping trips incorporated, to include camp sites.

Great App! Keep building it and improving! | Great idea. But everything is based on where you’re going rather than the chronological order in which you seeing/doing everything.

The only option it showed for pick up was several miles from the airport, near a business parking lot. We took an airport shuttle there, only to learn the bus stop was a decent walk away, through a weird industrial park. After finally finding our bus stop, the bus drove right by and didn’t stop! We tried to flag it down with no luck. At that point we were stranded several miles away from the airport and out the 5 pounds I paid for a day pass. Overall, using this app wasted 2 hours and resulted in a $140 Uber. Just go to the bus station at the airport and ignore the app completely. | Do not use this app if you are traveling from LHR. It listed the only available route from LHR to Oxford as departing from a bus stop outside of the airport.

While the bus did come, it sped right past us, even though we were waiting at the stop this app told us it would stop at. We sprinted after the bus and waived it down but it would not stop. 

This app will lead you astray, stranded, and with blisters from walking around so long just looking for information.

Most of the shortcomings I see are minor opportunities for enhancement:

* Notify and correct for time zones
* warn of dirt roads
* more sophisticated meta data like confirmation code and budget 

The journal option (capture photos that correspond to date, time, and waypoint location) is an amazing capability. | Always happy with the user interface, very handy with estimated driving time and easy to share itinerary with friends. I tried google trip and I’m just not as impressed. I recently ran into problems not being able to add scenic spots to my itinerary, sent them a user feedback with details, they responded quickly and resolved it within 2 days. I rarely see app that attentive to user feedbacks. Great job Funliday! | Love how I can share and others get to be able to input to the itinerary such an awesome app. | This is truly the best trip planning app. I’ve been using this for a few years now for every trip. Back then I literally tried 10 or so apps and none of them did what I needed. This one had a couple glitches, but it was so close to great and was still the best so I stuck with it. Customer service also fixed/enhanced some items quickly at my request. Now, the app works perfectly and does exactly what I need it to do. I tell everyone about it! Thank you for making this app! Also, I looove that you can share it with friends/family and they can make real-time updates to it as well! | This app used to work really well and was amazing for planning trips.  I used to be able to look up places and attractions easily and add them to my plans for each day but now adding attractions takes a long time to load.  Also, the app used to quickly determine transportation time based on whatever transportation mode I selected, and now it never figures it out.  Finally, I used to be able to easily move and rearrange the order of places to visit but now everything gets messed up when I try to do that.  When I first started using it I would have given it 5 stars but now I would give it zero if I could.  This app used to be perfect and now it is basically useless. | This app is great as everyone traveling in the group can see the plans on a given day. However, it’s difficult to have more than one activity in a day because it doesn’t let you set a start time for anything but the first activity. After that it assumes you are going directly to the next place. A little annoying as trips frequently have down time in between. | This is the first time using the app and am planning two trips simultaneously. I like it for the most part, once I figured it out it got easier. I am not able to edit the days, my travel partner imputed the wrong start date so that’s something I have to work around. Overall a pretty cool way for everyone to add to the itinerary and make the most of the trip!! | If I’m planning a trip to multiple cities it would be super useful to search and select a city vs a specific attraction. I thought at first this is what would happen when I selected a day and a map came up. Nothing happens when you do that. You can roam around in the map, but there is no ability to simply select a city as a way point. | I typically like using this app over TripIt. I like that it routes my activities on the maps and gives me allotted times of days depending on my duration. I like that it’s color coded by day. I like that it shows the drive time from one place to another. However....I would LOVE this app if it could Integrate our flights and hotel information and information of attractions, like tripit does. I would also like to edit an attraction by clicking it and assigning times by the minute. | 感謝設計這個軟體！唯一美中不足的地方是不知道為什麼每次電腦網頁版的起始日期總是比app版的日期提前一天呢？（是因為系統自動調整為台灣時區嗎？） | I’ve been using Google Trips and it did a lot of things well, but it’s itinerary mapping features are lacking and this app has been very useful in completing the job Google left undone. There is room for improvement here but in general very useful. | 如果附近景點能以（假如有前一筆資料的話）上一筆資料的附近景點做搜索的話就會更好了。往往使用者可能在旅程前就規劃！ | Easy to use! Thanks for the help in planning our family reunion!! | This was the best app to help with planning my vacation! I tell everyone to get it now! | Really good interface, nice functionality. | Super easy to arrange your travel schedule with your friends or family even your enemy! Lol nice app!! | As an avid traveler, I am VERY impressed with all this app has to offer and the hours it will save me with all of its amazing features! | Edit: My travel partner contacted the app developers and got an almost-immediate response.  They fixed the invite so that we were able to share the trip and though currently only the primary trip planner can make changes, that fix is coming. I'm excited to see what can be remedied. 

Well, I like the idea and the format, but there were a couple issues.  First I successfully was invited by a friend but when I attempted to invite her on the trip I had already set up, she never got the invite. Also, in an attempt to circumvent that I was going to add all of my itinerary to her trip but the app states I don't have permission to edit while not allowing her the option to grant permission. :-/ | Good app | It's super convenient to combine all the info together and google map. I love it's flexibility, can work offline and super easy to share with others. | Overall this app is excellent for creating a trip itinerary--using the app is fairly intuitive, and only takes a little while (10 min for me?) to figure out what you really need to start planning your trip. I especially appreciate the integration with Google maps (I think that's what it uses), and how you can save specific addresses (even residential ones) with nicknames (aliases). The developers have a good product with great potential :)

There are only two issues preventing me from giving the app 5 stars:
1) The travel time estimation feature for public transit in Japan (the area for which I am planning) doesn't work. As of this writing, the app only estimates driving time between locations (and sometimes walking times...but that's not exactly realistic when I need to go 30-40 km as quickly as possible). If this feature worked, it would help me greatly in realistically planning how many places I can actually visit in a day. 
2) The pop-up notification asking me to turn on location services comes up too often. Every single time I want to search or add a destination, it reminds me to turn location on. I prefer having it off, because having all the ""nearby places"" listed is distracting (and irrelevant right now, since I'm in a different country than the trip I'm planning for). Having the pop-up appear only when the app is opened would make for a much smoother, less annoying user experience. 

Aside from those two areas for improvement, I am really impressed with this app and thankful to the creators! | 還算好用的app，但有一些小功能不是那麼順手。 | I never could get this app to work. Very complicated and not at all useful. | 非常好用的規劃軟體，很適合 | Really useful!! | Overall it's a good app, user friendly.
One way it can be better is by letting us to add some notes into it rather than just adding location of here and there..
looking forward for improvements..
=] | This app is so cool. It really helpful for me, and help to efficiently manage my trip a lot. Even a short trip, I could be easy to handle it and change my schedule.

I never am able to do everything I want when I visit, and it’s nice to have past trips saved with stuff I have already researched. Also great you can add trips way out in the future. | Thai is a great tool for planning Vegas trips as well as finding places to go. Whenever we plan a trip we inevitably talk about places that we forget about once we're in the middle of it all. Pair this with Vegas Lists, another app that helps you save those places on your wish and to-do lists, and you've got a good way to have an even better time in Las Vegas. | Excellent for traveling to Vegas. My favorite part is the ability to find restaurants by location. It tells you what’s nearby, what’s open, and usually has a link to the menu. Been using this app for years and it has gotten better and better. | App stopped updating! | This does not help me sort my time I’m
Going to be on the ground | Awesome App!!

I use VegasMate to put together a list of places I want to visit in Vegas. The App gives great info regarding hours and menus for restaurants as well as great maps to know where you are going. 

The app creator, Hunter, has put together a great place to help people who love Las Vegas love it even more. Hunter is awesome. | Super helpful! Great tool!! | Ok. But where are many of the maps?! It's missing way too many maps. Like The Cosmopolitan, MGM, etc..... | This is the only app for Vegas that you need. I go to LV 2-3 times a year so I know if information is up to date, and this app is. For a Vegas greenhorn, you can read reviews and really get a feel for what you want to do, or where you'd like to stay, while avoiding the rip offs (like cabbies taking you through the tunnel to get to the south strip). Also functions great - never had a glitch in 2 years of using it. Download. You won't regret it. | The only Vegas guide you'll need. | A lot of info and features. Heard out this app on Vegas Gang & Five Hundy By Midnight podcasts | I download this app before every trip to Vegas, lots of great info to make getting around Vegas and planning your trip easier & more enjoyable | I love this app! I especially love the cab check feature!! Thanks Hunter! Keep up the great work!!! | Not written by the PR people, just others who have the app and use it. Very well done an updated every time I open it for new places to stay/play/eat | Time is precious when visiting Vegas - don’t waste it with at lame places - 

With Vegasmate on my phone, I can make plans on the fly and look like a Vegas expert to my friends. | I renewed this app since it worked so well last year.  Very disappointed that the dining section has so many old reviews that were worthless.  Also the distance did not work. Every restaurant was 0 feet away and within walking distance. | I get to the Permissions black screen and nothing else. Can't use app. Waste of time. | I have made 3 attempts to download this app and each other time I have reached a screen stating Permissions. It's a black screen and that's it. Freakin' frustrated! | So far works well !!! | It a good app for Vegas stuff, but the app is slow when scrolling. And why do I get ads? I paid for this app a while ago! | Useful features to help both with trip planning in advance of a trip and also help find things while in Vegas. | The best Las Vegas app, Has everything you need and more, I'm so glad I have this app ,It keeps me update on everything in Vegas as we all know it changes all the time, Thanks Again | I love this app. I have been using Vegas Mate for about 3 years and now can't really use anything else. much prefer the reviews of users to that of the hotels telling me how great  or bad the hotels/shows/restaurants with 0 PR BS.  Very stable and with a huge amount of info and pictures, I can't recommend this App enough. | How does this app have ""only"" a 4 star rating- it is totally 5 star all the way- I have this app in my iPhone - iPod touch- and iPad- and love it on all Apple devices. The constant updates that Hunter puts out makes this the most have Vegas app for any apple person! | This app is extremely useful for people visiting Vegas for the first time, and still useful on my 21st time! | Best. | Great concept, but missing a lot of information. The attractions section is sparse and the overall look is boring. Also more pictures would be helpful. | Do not waste your time | Joining the long list of Apps that want more $$$ from you after your purchased it. 

Also, annoyingly sets up an always-on geofence (constantly using GPS) even when the app is closed. | Paid for original version. Now they want you to pay again. Not worth it at all. Most content reviews are outdated | This app is always getting updated with the latest Vegas info which is amazing in a city that changes so much and so often. New versions seem to be well tested and customer service is great. You can tell there is a love of Vegas built into this app. I wish it existed for other cities. | Used to love this but crashes and never opens. Have reinstalled to no avail. | This app is fantastic! Even if you 'like', not ""love"" Vegas, you're going to enjoy this app! Restaurant menus and their hours, reviews of the hotel, rooms, amenities and all casinos makes this app a must have from newbies to Vegas experienced old timers! | Truly the most complete app about Vegas available and getting better all the time. Perfect for newbies and frequent visitors. Don't know how I ever got around Vegas without it. | Don't waste your time. Has a ""subscription"" service for updates. Give me a break. Can get this information from other places without the subscription and fake reviews on places. This is just a scam to get more money by the developers. | I have used VegasMate for years, this new update is the best ever. Even as a veteran Vegas visitor i find it indispensable in my trip preperation. | After hearing about this app on one of the Vegas podcasts I listen to. I didn't even wait to read reviews before purchasing it. 
The app has potential but it seems that all of the features I have looked at are at least 10 months old! The Vegas news is current, but reviews, pictures, shows, etc are all outdated. Even the recent update section is three months old. Please catch up!!! | This app provides little useful information and instead just continues to show the same web link for most requests.  Useless.  When updating the database as the app wants to do immediately, I believe this app is copying your contact information, since all the scant information is still both very general and as others have indicated, out of date. 

This is most likely a scam application. | Omg, this app could not be more worthless. When searching for rooms with this app, it quoted me rates such as ""$900 average rate at tropicanA"". Obviously that is totally wrong, as was every single hotel rate they quoted. They must be averaging all of the rates, including suites, which is worthless to me. Every hotel rate is going to look expensive if you lump in the fancy suite rates. Seriously, worthless app. Just google Las Vegas instead, or ask a friend whose been to vegas. Awful app! | Don't waste money or time on this. | I love this app! It's so helpful every time I am planing a Vegas trip and even better when you get there. It's always being updated so no information is out of date. Worth every cent you pay for it. | Lots of great info, even for a Vegas regular. Lots of updates too--always seems up to date with the ever changing/evolving Vegas scene. Recommended! | We use it every trip to Vegas | Vegas Mate is a fantastic Vegas app at a very reasonable price.  I use it every time I go to Vegas and also to help plan my trip there.  Keep up the good work!! | This app crashes constantly. Too difficult to use with the constant crashing. | Vegas Mate, Vegas Mate, it's really great! | Title says it... Maps news, reviews, lists this app has it all. | I've travelled to Vegas annually for a conference for several years and can't believe how much I used this app on my recent trip. Great info. You won't be disappointed. | This is a great app! I basically use it to brainstorm plans for upcoming trips. When I read or hear about a place, I look it up on Vegas Mate and dump it into my upcoming trip. Then when it comes to the planning stage, I sift through my brainstorming to see which things I want to make time for. The app also has lots of great articles, and I find it especially useful to be able to see restaurants' menus and hours. Thanks! | Vegas Mate has it all.  Hotel reviews, attraction info, restaurant menus with reviews, menus, and in many cases prices. Always very helpful.",4.67692,260,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/04/f8/82/04f882b1-7a80-2a47-9188-9957f157c41e/73eb3092-d4af-4dfb-bb1b-a9cb2b3acf23_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2022-04-08_at_17.13.25.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/79/15/2e/79152e7f-bcdd-2c76-00f7-8c251619eef8/f40a193a-ec4b-4caa-b7b1-2c7a7174d3f5_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2022-04-08_at_17.13.32.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/9c/12/6b/9c126b14-49a0-efa5-969d-4a2daba0868b/4b2da261-08c2-47e8-9868-1517f55a8948_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2022-04-08_at_17.13.38.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/af/ff/d5/afffd5b0-191c-8d67-3ac7-dadc728630e4/4110fc67-8347-4553-9ab3-c84cdf800d7b_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2022-04-08_at_17.13.41.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/c8/82/6b/c8826be3-97fe-d599-27e0-9dbf54068a95/554612bd-ea75-4a3b-873a-64e1c381c7cd_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2022-04-08_at_17.14.00.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/86/6e/08/866e08c5-9ad6-9e15-37db-3ef1182abeb4/11bf4bb7-4582-4806-a91d-7e48bf788c3f_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2022-04-08_at_17.13.49.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/ef/b8/e6/efb8e657-88f1-8256-8602-0c8bce7089d2/84ed1f26-5c22-4609-bb29-a589cfb7f798_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2022-04-08_at_17.15.55.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/86/79/31/8679310b-13e1-79c2-66d9-9a491441b413/3a3af4d1-40d5-4916-b8f9-b3a538e069e0_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2022-04-08_at_17.16.12.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The OSM Maps are the best maps for offline (or online for that matter).  Guru's move to the macOS platform is a really nice addition - though I must admit I don't use it on my MacBook Air much as my iPadPro is much faster and I like the touch interface.  Overall, Guru is my go to offline/Navigation App. I do my long range travel planning in Furkot.com and Export my GPX data in Guru GPX format. Data management on Guru is straight forward and I haven't found any real limitations. With the Pro-version, I have 79GB of the worlds roads (maps) on my iPhone & iPadPro. Those maps update frequently at no additional cost. 

The only thing missing for me, feature wise, is Track Editing features. | After many km in the road with Guru( I’ve used other navigations apps before) this is THE best app. 
I get to see small backroads that I’ll never have found by myself. And I’m confident that I’ll not be taken to dead ends or anything impossible. 
Thanks a lot | Easy to import GPX files. I was able to navigate with Guru Maps Pro in the mountains of Ecuador. I use the app anyplace I might not have cellular service. 

I'm very happy that the app keeps improving and getting updated. A lot of features have been added over time. 

I use it less for recording, but the option is there.

A solid mapping and navigation tool. | Have tried them all, and this one is truly outstanding. | This program is by far the best program for navigation of offline mapping. Evgen is always improving the functions for faster access. Just added is Apple CarPlay which puts it above the competition. A few minor bugs are being worked on at the time of this review but believe me, they will probably be fixed before you download. I highly recommend this program for both vehicle and hiking. | the settings in the system settings app is gone. along with the “disallow cluster” settings. 
please bring it back!!! | 为啥账号不能互通会员？ | Best offline map app but please develop iWatch version. thanks you! | Would recommend. I use it for motorcycle trips where I am frequently out of cellular service. | I got this to use offline with only gps on trails where service doesn't exist. This has become so bloated with features that it has been less and less appealing and useful to me...now I have to provide an account to sync?! It's a shame since I've been using this for years and it's stable and polished... | Couldn't download any maps after 4th of July,now new update won't work on old IOS , disappointed, app served well for few years | So I caved in and created an Apple Sign in. However it will not sync my bookmarks from my iPhone (a running Guru Maps 4.10.2) that were synced to the cloud. So if you deleted your old version and sign in with this new version you lose your bookmarks!!

Please bring back an option for the old iCloud syncing!

Ver 5.0.1 iCloud Sync still hasn’t been added back (without having to sign in) for iOS devices. 

 Ver 5.0 Why can’t I still have access to my bookmarks I have previously synced with iCloud? Now I have to create an account in order to do this? No! This is not what I paid for. Please bring back the ability to sync via iCloud WITHOUT needing to have an account! Otherwise I would like a refund so I can go elsewhere. Thank you | I used this map program for years.
I love being able to track where I went and look at it later, and even save the data. We travel quite a bit, and use it on every trip, to help us get around, and to track our routes. Then it tells how far we traveled. Great for bike rides as well.
I started by using the Google maps while traveling, but have trouble getting it to fill in, and needed to find someplace with WiFi to fill in the details. Galileo let’s you download the maps you need and all the details are there.
I also really like being able to measure distance between two points on the map. I have organized a number of files that allows me to turn on and off points of interest, and past routs that I have traveled.
 Excellent map program, I’ll never travel without it. | I us the app in offline mode fishing in remote Canada. No fear of getting lost among the numerous islands and lookalike land features. | This app has exceptionally fast map redraw speed of its offline maps. Import of GPX files is easy and once they add Routing to Galileo (Guru) it will be a 5 Star App.

UPDATED:
Turn-by-turn was added and works flawlessly offline.  Did I mention the maps? They are the best map implementation of any mobile nav app - OSM or proprietary maps - and I've tried them all!

I travel the world and have the world's OSM maps on my phone - 69GB!!! With that much map data other nav apps crawl to a halt performance wise - not Guru. Of course most other map makers don't cover the whole world like OSM does. | 12/6/2021 the map needs some type of traffic notifications. Also, show map  in 3 D. 

12/4/2021 it would be nice if once a destination is calculated. The map would show several route alternatives. Presently, it only shows one. 11/24/2021 for the price one pays for the app. It should have better Lange guidance method. It should have a visual depiction of the lanes and what lane one should get in to exit 11/24/2021. For the price. It should have traffic notifications. | I downloaded the trial version and started downloading images while I had high speed internet. I just paid for the app, and ALL my images are gone, and I don’t have high speed internet now. How do I get my images from the original to the pro version? | Would not change a thing.
Make sure you save to the cloud! | Great app | I’ve had this app for several years and use it regularly to navigate where cell and WiFi are not readily available in places like Cuba, Ireland, hiking in the Great Smokey Mountains, etc.  

I especially like the ability to save locations in categories and control which POI’s are displayed on screen.  

Uses relatively small amount of storage for the detailed maps and routing. 

Does exactly as advertised! | Getting “error: 6  cannot resolve host name”. The default map is useless for navigation and points of interest. | This is a real navigator. You can daily trust and rely on. I use it on daily basis. One defect if you wanna call it a defect. Why Arabic language is not supported?  Really thanks for this amazing app. | Thanks for nothing. | This app represents separatists view on the borders, representing unrecognized, separatist territories as independent states.

This is purely russian view, as the rest of the world thinks that:

ABKHAZIA AND SAMACHABLO IS GEORGIA
CRIMEA IS UKRAINE
KARABAKH IS AZERBAIJAN

RUSSIA IS OCCUPANT!!! | I’ve used this while walking around London and while riding my motorcycle around the SW United States. Works well following saved tracks as on the COBDR or finding a route to a pub for a late lunch. | Please consider to add Arabic language in the next update | Holy crap again, did you see the response to my review? Shoulda woulda done this or that like its a problem with my phone not with the app! If the app is difficult to use it’s not the phone it’s the NAMELESS  PERSON WHO ANSWER THSES REVIEWS.Holy crap, have you seen SEPTEMBER 2 review, the developers answer to a complaint? ASK APPLE FOR A REFUNDI well heres my chance to get my monies back.upgraded to pro a long time ago, check in once in a while and its still not as practical nor  useful  to use as the Gmap. Whats the point of having tons of different maps if doing a simple “show me from here to here” takes longer than five minutes to figure out. | was a great app, but now you can’t import a gpx file anymore. App does not show on the share sheet. No answer from customer sipport/developer | Simply the best maps for hiking! Shows all the trails not just the official ones. The data is from open street map and Guru Maps adds a well polished interface. | I do winter hiking through the winter months, several times a week.  I go to places where it would be easy to get lost.  The app uses very little phone battery reserve and the combination of the comprehensive off line trail mapping with the satellite location feature is powerful in terms of knowing where I am located and what my options are for a great hike and getting back to the trailhead.  The “two-finger” distance measurement, while not crucial, is extremely useful and unique to navigation apps.

The documentation and organization feature of all past hikes is also extremely valuable in hike planning and sharing of its GPX record files.

I don’t leave home without Guru!!!
PapaJoe | Very helpful apps for record track as offline , | Love the features of the map and the ability to track the routes. As an avid rider I love seeing my stats for my run and this provides a great amount of detail. What’s lacking is the map seem to be pulled out of a paper map. The visual effect of google or apple maps is missing giving it an old feel to it. I have found myself more and more using rever for that reason alone as both apps do the same. However the graphic quality of rever is better. Would love to see better maps in the feature. Otherwise a great app. | This was my five star navigation app, then I upgraded to iOS 13 and can’t even load a gpx file into Guru now. Doesn’t show as a viable recipient of gpx files on the ‘share’ list. Help! | Dont know what happened to this App, used to work great now, worthless... unless its an address like restaurant or bar etc,,, wont allow you to navigate to the address. Sent 2 emails asking for support with no reply over a week ago. | Great until it simply stops tracking and doesn’t let you know it has. You could be going a long time without tracking as intended leaving big gaps in coverage. 

Very frustrating and damaging. 

Developers advised but offered no solution. | The first time I used this worthless app I put in a precise street address in Paris France. The app immediately put in a different address with the correct number but a different street. I tried to correct the error but it would not allow me to change the wrong address. What good is this app if it changes your address to another wrong address. What an expensive disappointment this is. One star rating because there is nothing lower. | Nice app.  Only wish it would work with apple CarPlay. | Very helpful to be able to navigate walking around Havana offline!! | I initially bought this for my Camino de Santiago walk but have been using it for every walk

Download the offline maps for the areas you will be...they enlarge up to incredible detail

What I love best is the GPS tracking of your walk.  You hit record at the beginning and turn it off when your done with your walk and you’ve got an accurate tracking of where you’ve walked with mileage, time walked, time idle and elevation changes 

It works completely without Wi-Fi or cell signal 

I can’t recommend it enough! | I based my entire website on this app. I love it. I’ve used it for years all ready. I recommend it | I’ve tried several map apps, and this is the best, no question. I just wish it would show as many local stores as Apple Maps in my area. | I have used it for several years. I live in the USA and travel a lot there and internationally, especially in China. Guru (Galileo) has never failed me.  I never use google, and rarely use apple maps.  My first look is always Guru. It even works to track your flight path when in airplane mode.  

I walk around foreign cities and countryside, never worried about network connection.  I tag my hotel, or friends home or bus/train station to maintain my orientation. If I find a great, tiny restaurant in an urban maze, tag it.  

Just download or update maps before you go and all is well. | Love this app, I first downloaded it because of work and then I moved away where services can be even worse. The great part about this app is you can pre download the map for the area and it works offline which is ideal especially if you’re not wanting to use data or unable to. Being able to pin things to find them again is great and the pins have different categories which is perfect for me. Hands down better then the other maps for these reasons. Google maps has some offline capabilities but it seems to not be as accurate. | A great app!! I suggest GPS filtering.  Evgen suggests accuracy filter 100 ft, distance threshold 20 ft.

The ascent and descent needs work. It needs filtering, because at present it adds in all the ups and downs of GPS data and gives you a figure that is at least double what it should be. | Have LOVED this app for years. The most recent update appears to have broken it. All maps deleted and no way to re-download them.

The maps are back! Hurray!!! So excited everything is working again because, as I said, I haves loved it for years. | I’ve used and loved this app for years. Normally I’d rate it 5 stars. However, the latest version started crashing instantly after I entered a search term. I’ve tried force closing and restarting my iPhone, but no luck. Please get this bug fixed! | App crashes when loading a map. Doesn’t last 10 seconds running. I want my money back | After some hours app is crashing and app can't use. IPhone 7 plus, ios 10.3.3 | Easy to learn/use. Great visuals. Really want to calculate routes in evening while online to use offline next day. Too bad. | I downloaded and paid for the app, downloaded all the states that I will be traveling and clicked the offline option.
I’m in my vehicle going to new locations constantly and you can Not put in an address even though you have the maps downloaded, you have to have internet so not offline at all unless you just want to watch yourself drive around real time which does nothing for me and probably most people.",4.74056,821,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bb/ca/be/bbcabeb7-ae14-d1a9-9464-77526558ea42/2b96a0ca-2332-451f-bd9e-995044952fd2_iPhone_8_Plus_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2f/06/bf/2f06bfe0-ee84-b852-a3d4-c1adde0c8848/07da6753-a97a-4da9-86c8-7d7859694dad_iPhone_8_Plus_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4d/73/c3/4d73c343-2937-d0e4-8ad2-0496b9249c9d/658136f2-6fa9-41c3-93a9-65d1f558c4fb_iPhone_8_Plus_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/68/3b/5f/683b5f6b-a5d6-c1d6-74e7-e05b86364c0a/1ef160db-711c-4e5a-83ce-c8b13f956cac_iPhone_8_Plus_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ab/5c/2e/ab5c2ee2-b9f6-4cbc-3970-877678941ef5/abb2e2db-aa7c-4e41-9d5d-ac67e23e0cba_iPhone_8_Plus_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/19/83/a3/1983a312-4b70-6e7a-535c-1536d43c3481/3a67752c-7c8d-4d55-8b2c-94c195e35179_iPhone_8_Plus_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c7/c2/f1/c7c2f157-8640-fe6a-b51d-2ad0d234f246/322d8819-503b-494b-9f63-0f1173da1d97_iPhone_8_Plus_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0c/7c/fe/0c7cfe95-1be1-b45f-6352-4471703f74b7/36ec02e4-b272-4d02-8f8f-4197e723a718_iPhone_8_Plus_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d2/2a/fd/d22afd7f-4552-00bb-0526-4612d35d7d62/f3188da1-6382-4e7c-9152-e0423478f908_iPhone_8_Plus_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0f/96/46/0f9646f8-3dbd-c0b4-c8e4-a42ea9ecd731/8e187544-21a2-48e4-89cd-fdc18b72b985_ipadPro129_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/af/82/4b/af824b69-cdae-26f7-65b1-fa5468e99337/0fd6f008-7a62-4c9c-811f-666f6c31051e_ipadPro129_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/cd/aa/07/cdaa0737-858c-0179-380c-929ef4bb1991/bc3d322d-dfec-4ddd-bc1b-5f30877098ef_ipadPro129_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a8/83/74/a8837425-1856-9d91-045a-e6af076452ad/543b5b63-5ba4-451c-9df1-f74878d73e8f_ipadPro129_4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/b1/41/5fb1410b-edec-baee-c72a-b82b7dd6be52/48f5f2c8-be51-453e-b07a-9970e623469d_ipadPro129_5.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/25/e0/72/25e0723e-4550-0dd3-91d5-ba9f195c5bef/d75c039e-51be-4a0a-b916-d2c079e8a201_ipadPro129_6.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/91/2b/08/912b0820-fc28-61cb-a598-4e37a6a17079/e733c6dd-5586-4bed-9e51-4cd9dfbb786b_ipadPro129_7.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7f/31/30/7f31307b-dafb-6199-3700-0507d68929bb/5a5213d9-7fbe-4e24-95c3-09dec6358ba7_ipadPro129_8.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/fc/fa/28/fcfa289f-40ee-728d-768f-4cce18a6c0a9/53067dc0-3f64-4889-9afd-3648db9a222e_ipadPro129_9.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iP

A good pick when you outgrow Duolingo. | Not as fun as Duo but more useful content! | I wish they had Easter Asian Language options - but great way to learn a new Language | Bisaya please | Absolutely amazing resource! | I had expected more conversational lessons. There is too much formal and writing lessons. 

I also have technical issues with seeing all answer options because I can’t scroll down to all answers. 

Disappointing. | This app has been very helpful in learning Scandinavian languages. But it has a glitch. It often opens to a white screen and the only resolution os to reinstall it. Not anymore. STILL IT SHUTS THE ENTIRE IPAD DOWN when I change to another language. Sending a screenshot makes no sense; the shot would be a black screen. Sometimes the ipad will restart, other times I need to restart it. I’d give this a five star for the teaching method, but the steps that were originally suggested  did not work. Log out, reinstall, fine for a  few weeks, but crashing again. I use the iPad keyboard that has the characters on it for the language, and I am learning, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish.
Additionally, why is an icon on my home screen that talks about.             ”everyday conversations updated”, yet when I access it, I am not able to use it?!!! An error screen appears. There is plenty of material to learn. If the app doesn’t work, take it off! | Will charge you without warning!   I got many charges of about $100 every few months without email or warning.  This is an automatic charge they will it tell you about. | El interesante | Awesome app | I bought the lifetime subscription, but seeing the mistranslations on the very beginning lessons that are suppose to be the easiest is dishearting. 
I took screen shots but cant add them here. 
But they translate “¿Están casados?"" to ""Are you married?” And they translate “Ellas beben unos vasos de leche.” to “They are drinking some glasses of milk.” 
If there are mistakes in the easiest lessons how am I to be confident that the harder lessons are mistake free? | Functional wise, it’s perfect. I’ve used it on the computer, tablet, and phone. And while technically, it is better than Duolingo, for the money it’s not worth it. You’re better off to get the paid version of Duolingo. In my opinion, this program is a mix of time wasting absurdly easy tasks, mixed with things of impossible difficulty. Because they will ask you questions on things that contain words that they did not teach you out of nowhere.  Or they may show you something once and then just presume you to know it forever. There’s no study sheets on verb conjugations so that you can memorize them or anything of this nature that I’ve seen. It’s just simply not good. Not in my opinion. I think if you wanna learn a language, you’re better off to just do a hodgepodge of whatever free programs you can get like Duolingo and just look things up on the Internet yourself and just memorize stuff and then do a mixture of watching TV and movies and possibly talking to chat gpt, etc | It is not as advertised. In the ad and in the pictures it said nowhere about a subscription. Then once I had spent fifteen minutes doing the introduction, signing up and the first lesson, it suddenly says I need an expensive subscription to continue. I’m disappointed. For those who can afford it, it would be a great app, but not for me (a broke student). Hopefully we can get a free version with ads soon. | When doing the lessons and having only one answer below, it gives the answer away. Additionally, trying to figure out what the lesson entails is difficult at times without an explanation. Lastly, the student should be able to go back to beginning lessons and review and this is very difficult to do. I’ve been studying vocabulary on my own with much better success than what I’ve gained from Babbel. As a result I have been avoiding Babbel. | Auto renews without warning, only tells you when you’re charged.  And if you try to cancel the day you find out, they won’t let you until the next cycle.  

That’s the behavior of an app that doesn’t believe in its offering.  Bad form. | I’m only a few lessons in and it seems very spelling based. It shows you the words once or twice and then has you fill in the word with the letters. I was really loving it at first but I had to download a few other apps to get me through it. It may be teaching you one skill but throws a ton of vocab you’ve never seen before into the mix and it can get over whelming fast! | I will buy a lifetime subscription if you make that offer available on the mobile app | Don’t interrupt | I really recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a new language. I am currently learning German and it’s just 👌although one small problem… when I started my subscription I chose British English instead of American English as a joke but when I switch British to American It restarts me, really wish that it would keep my progress. But overall, 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 🤫🧏🏼🧏🏼‍♂️

Yes, I’m a gen Z person. | Hello, I am a learner on Babbel that is not satisfied with the production. I do not like how you have to pay for the second lesson. I like Duolingo much more. It is free to learn Spanish and more. It also has a variety of languages you can choose from. Like Klingon! I checked the languages and there wasn’t my language that I wanted to learn. You might think I am being dramatic, like of course not all language apps have Navajo and High Valariyin like Duolingo. Sorry if I spelled the last example wrong. But, I was actually looking for Irish, which is a common language spoke by millions of people. I really wanted to learn that language. It also has very little instructions on what to do when you want to review your speaking. You were supposed to hold down the microphone, and then you speak. I thought you click the microphone, and then say it. That are all my concerns. Sincerely, Ex-Learner. ❤️ | The “Review” sections don’t work in any of the lessons- really dissatisfied with this expensive app | Please offer this option | Great | If you really want to learn how to speak a language. This is your app | Before practicing daily, I didn’t fully notice how great this app is at teaching you! I might’ve done a few days in a row but then I would fall off for multiple days if not longer. 

Well I’ve done just a three week commitment of everyday practice, 15-30 minutes. It’s incredible how much I’ve retained. Specifically, I seasonally work with people who speak Spanish, and I’ve noticed a difference the past few days with my ability to communicate. Just simple phrases and sentences but things that previously left my brain so quickly are staying.. and with the way babble teaches tons of things at a time (almost sneakily!!), it feels almost like a snowball effect. 

I’m very excited to see where a few months of dedicated practice gets me! 

*Also, I love to get my Babbel practice in everyday on my lunch break - that’s how little it feels like work! | This app is good at teaching and it might be helpful for those who have some difficulty with learning | Hi! Just a quick review on this app here! I started learning German just about a week ago and WOW… I’m having so such fun!!! It’s easy to learn quick helpful reminders and techniques, while also letting you have free time on your hands practicing translating sentences. It’s also really fun and interesting to learn how to speak the language. I liked everything about this app overall and I definitely recommend going ahead and giving it a try!  However… the app only gets 4 stars because if you want to learn more, you normal have to wait 12 hours or get the subscription. I personally think if you plan on using a subscription, it should be used for bonuses in the app, instead of paying for more content. This is still a VERY wonderful app, so I will continue to support and I also ( once again ) definitely recommend! | this is perfect for those who sre just starting out, but once you get like half way through you’re gonna wanna start supplementing other sources like podcasts and books to continue learning | Finally, an app that works as advertised. Easy to follow along and understand. | Tfjjvib | There are many good things to say about the app, like many reviewers already pointed out. So I will focus on the things I don't like so much.
For one, it does not repeat spoken words, unless you force it to by tapping on it. Why not automatically repeat them a few times. Or at least give users the option in settings so that new words are spoken 3 times (or any number of times) maybe even with different voices in different speeds. 
Then it asks you to fill in blanks in such an obvious way by providing pictures with the possible answers that everyone can do it without thinking. 
There is just generally too much interaction involved. You can't do an exercise without constantly tapping your screen to continue. 
It also throws in lots of new words while training you a specific new word without explaining the others. Yes, they give you the English translation, but that's not helpful unless you constantly look at the screen. It is just too visual for me. 
In combination with my LEARN SPANISH podcast it is quite nice, despite all the things I mentioned above. Not cheap though. | Great app,  I used it to keep up on my French for quite awhile and also to start learning German.  Things are very intuitive and laid out well.  It made it very easy to learn writing/reading/speaking which is a hard combo to find.   

I didn’t renew my subscription the last time though because they only support 14 languages (mostly western) and I was getting into learning Korean which they don’t have.  

I’ll keep an eye on things though and will definitely be returning if they ever add support for more east-asian languages ^.^. | Per the fine print in the “terms and conditions”, your access auto-renews and if you are done dealing with this not very effective app, you’d better cancel this auto-renewal before your subscription expires because otherwise they will charge you for the renewal and run with your money. | I use this app on my phone.I can’t always see all the material on the questions. | Price is ok but hard to maintain consistent practice for reasons below. 

Gives you more sentences in the beginning and moves faster than Duolingo but makes you spell the new words out!! At the first part of the lesson there are no tips for spelling which is HARD when you’re trying to learn French.

Also introduces a lot of extra words to make sentences so prior knowledge is helpful to figure out the context. 

And the microphone is reeeaaalllyyy picky. Overall, more advanced than Duolingo but hardly close to user friendly for a quick lesson. | This is all I’ve ever wanted in regards to learning Spanish. I need something convenient since I’m always on the go. I also needed something fun and engaging, so that I can stay consistent. It also keeps track of how many days you practice in a row, so that you can uphold a streak and thus remain accountable. Love it! | I can’t use it it wants me to subscribe Fine I won’t use it but will a better app to use I canceled early so I wouldn’t have worry about renewal if I wasn’t using it. Now I don’t think I would use or recommend | A+++++++++ | I got this because I wanted to learn french but i don’t have the money to pay for it:( is there any way you could make a free version with ads or something? | The Babbel ads make it look like this app is great for quickly learning conversational language in preparation for a trip but I find it focuses too much on grammar and not on conversations. | Other then the fact that it doesn’t let you do some lessons it great but it is a bit confusing to work the app in the beginning | I love Babbel. Babbel, unlike all other language apps, is very comprehensive on grammar and provides many great resources that the other language learning apps do not!! | all of my ""writing"" sections in both reviews and lessons are autofilled. the ""speaking"" portion glitches constantly—i thought it was a result of my pronunciation but, after i speak, the app glitches and asks me to repeat myself again. i've liked using babbel for the past few months and am disappointed at the seemingly overnight change once i took advantage of the lifetime promo. | So it is ok but the thing is there is only like 5 languages | Purchased the app a while back. Was a little confused on what I purchased and contacted support. They reset my account without me asking and said they thought that was what I wanted. Then I said no and asked again. Next day I got an email the ticket was closed. 

Then I got a ticket asking me how the support was and I clicked bad and stated we never addressed my question and closed the ticket. 

I had paid for a year and since just moved on to a new app so it was a waste of money due to poor support. | So I speak a fair amount of French this app is not only confusing. It’s useless. Babbel is terrible. It doesn’t teach you anything about conversation that you will ever need. I am so upset that I actually paid for a year of it. Don’t waste your money take a class online or a tutor. | Very helpful | I can’t get customers service.  Please give me back my money | God is great 👌 | I so wish this app included some sort of search feature so one could go back and review a specific topic, like articles, for example.",4.72274,592039,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c5/b2/24/c5b22493-227f-09bd-59d2-797abda5167e/faea642e-c65f-4abb-a9a3-f8fa0c29e8af_AppStore_1242x2208_ENG_US_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a6/b2/0f/a6b20f67-344d-a755-14bd-6c7c29c923ac/63e554d0-4b47-4fab-be3d-a57280fe21d1_02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/13/0c/8f/130c8f8b-1e4f-fcae-a2a1-60c904e3128c/6538a687-e7bb-4c1e-8e6f-5ef54e0cb402_03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0b/ca/40/0bca40a5-fe17-5257-9376-9d198f6756fe/15fe13e8-425a-4e01-9462-b35bf88ff168_04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/25/fd/3f/25fd3f8e-bce1-63c9-26af-33255f0f60bc/900477bc-a5c2-4147-abd6-b3a66c457ca5_05.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b1/96/da/b196daac-f7da-6c77-1026-4f5fc0c25ec0/c52c443f-de6c-4361-8c01-ec16e6eee9fb_06.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0f/af/4f/0faf4f4e-a45b-ff00-6679-027eceb40adf/91a78ce3-e500-4014-95c5-5c0d33a5b7e6_07.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/4f/9c/a7/4f9ca7b4-bcde-304d-78d3-c93d55fc1532/e8f6b604-915d-48f7-9063-5df865220be9_08.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/bb/5c/70/bb5c70d2-d998-89e4-02a7-dcb8f8c8dff6/f924c1bc-03d7-40b4-a266-bb93854d7462_AppStore_2048x2732_ENG_US_01.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/87/db/ac/87dbac6a-1026-3510-cf8e-7a91f2767b73/d6b301e0-cb1a-4ae7-85cf-185dbe6e7cda_02.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/21/b3/c4/21b3c4c5-d9c0-70be-c9dc-f68773c3b3d2/a932651c-cde4-4d85-9aeb-fe65daf0e1f1_03.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/25/19/f5/2519f511-83d9-c705-b820-8fde0999a065/d892c114-1064-46ba-8152-93df55eab364_04.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e7/dc/17/e7dc17d6-c21b-893f-78c7-b140562037fc/ffc10c49-21c1-489d-b22f-d83a19e946fe_05.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1c/12/86/1c1286c4-f171-3868-0589-d2158b453585/067e60e9-2969-4eb2-b6e5-186f9b61af2b_06.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f6/02/7f/f6027fd6-6a4b-266b-d1e6-24ffedad6566/69a6c1d1-b50e-426c-8bd9-931d9e4d9348_07.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifth

Gives you the price of all the airlines, and you can call or book it right there on the app. Def an app that everyone should have | I'm in the travel industry as well as I'm always commuting from all over the place domestic and internationally back home...and I couldn't do without Cheap Flights.  It's the best for all your price searching best price.  Thank you Cheap Flights... I can't do without you in my travel world??✈️. | Easy to use and always find best deals for flights. | Easy to use, always get me the lowest price. Two thumbs way way up. | The title says it all. When I need to travel and want the best value, Cheap Flights comes through with reliable results. | Best Travel App Hands Down. It always has the lowest prices of every airline. In years I've never seen the price beat anywhere. | Easy to use, accurate, and covers all the basic info you need to know in simple format. Great for actual and dream trip planning. | I love Cheap Flights. It ha great features, like the option to adjust your dates based on an easy to use map that shows price ranges. Great features, straightforward, comprehensive. | This app is great!  Found me a flight that was less expensive than all the online search engines - I compared ALL of them within a few minutes time. | Love this app and I always use it for my travels.  Love their updates on price changes!  I get both emails and in-app notifications and if you no longer want the alerts, you can click on the email link and delete notification. | I used to love Cheap Flights, I would used it always. It was great to be able to choose a whole month, select everywhere and be able to see the best prices and destinations to choose from. Now is more about deal packages and more difficult to select countries according to best price. Sometimes updates and ""improvementes"" simply destroy the expierence. | Don't book anything without looking through this app first. | This App is pretty good in actually find easily the cheapest available flights. Much easier than searching in browers or other Apps I used. I can easily check daily with one click the same flight over and over again. And prices vary from time to time. I am pretty happy about this App. | I have been using this website and app for over 5 Years now. 
Local, international flights, hotels and car hire. 
No site comes even close. Luv it ?☘? | See title.  Would not use anything else for air travel! | I've tried many others but I keep coming back to Cheap Airline Tickets Bookings for my flight searches. I love the interface and it consistently finds the cheapest fares. | Stay away, they are scammers . I just lost 4000 bucks in  Tickets!!  FRAUDULENT SITE !! 
PCM travel agency ! Stay away!! This site should be banned . | I love this app | This is a great app for finding deeply discounted airfares. | I booked 2 flights on 06-05-23 to Cancún, flight was booked I received confirmation, with in 2hours they called and emailed me and said we are sorry this flight is no more available but we have an other option for you- their option had extra layovers and was not convenient and was 300$ more expensive, after negotiation they offered me 100$ discount which I approved it,  next day  I saw they charged me 100$ extra as agent fee, 
Be care full with booking through this app, they will scam you and will try to find ways to get your money | This App works perfect, always a good discount the only problem. Is that the Business option never works, it used to work a year ago but not anymore | This app I realized is missing some important airports, for example the airport code XPL it need to update the airport database for newer airports | This app shows bogus prices in order to get you to commit to purchasing a ticket and enter your credit card information. You will get a confirmation from the app but you never get the E-ticket or confirmation number from the airline. Then you get calls from a call center overseas stating that you booked a “restricted” ticket where you can’t bring anything with you not even a carry on and you can’t purchase that at the airport and that you can’t cancel either. Then they claim they will be working with you and try to find you another ticket that’s far more expensive than what you saw online of course and they will not take no for an answer. 
Just stay away and book your ticket from a reputable website | I love the tips! | This is the best app of its kind that I’ve found so far. It’s got great insights and helps find the best ticket prices around. | No functionality! Don’t understand who is giving it 5 stars !! | This is great app and cheapest in every one I know it thanks for a good deal tickets I will give a five stars for it, thanks. | In low with this app, cheap! | This app is great but nowdays all of the time i see a good offer from company call myholidays when I am about to proceed for payment I find a different amount of the deal they was offering I don’t know why but I think it’s kind of scam that app was more than fine to me I booked many flights from it | Best deals. I just need a contact number have a few questions. 

Thanks! | I used this app, and it took me quite a while, but I was not at allDisappointed. I got a great flight at the price I wanted.I’m keeping this app on my phone in case I need it in the future. | I love this app I went to México City for several days for only $277 it really searches for the cheap flights!! I absolutely love it! Highly recommend it! | I don’t normally write reviews because I never really have anything positive to say!! But this app is the best app I’ve experienced and I’m not a frequent flyer I did everything wrong booked last minute of all places Disney in December but this app was a life saver!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED | Thanks | I really love this app honestly. | I saw my mom using this website and I was shocked to see low prices of tickets on her screen! I thought she found a gold mine! I tried the app and now I can keep a lookout for low priced tickets without so much searching and sifting! I love this app! It really does find cheap flights because I love traveling internationally! | Title tells it all. | Awesome app | Thumbs up! | #1 | Most excellent! | Muy buena esta app.. me gusta mucho y fácil de usar | Thanks! | Best flight search engine | Use it mostly for price comparing and booking of flights works great almost every time. Sometimes direct airline sales are cheaper though wish they would include those in the results too | Don’t use this, they will steal your money | Not a seasoned traveler and I have been looking at about 9 different apps for a big trip.. This app won! Easy and it came up with a good prices and the variety of depart and arrive times I needed. Recommend highly. | App is great and already save me lots of money but there is no option for multi-city trip. 
Most of the time when I travel,  I want to go back from different city. If I get each tick separate as one way it becomes expensive. If there was multi-city option like google flight that would be great | FareDepot seems is not a serious company
I found this in BBB.ORG:
Pattern of Complaint
On September 7, 2017, BBB staff contacted FareDepot.com concerning a pattern in complaints filed with our office.  Specifically, consumers alleged the business failed to provide timely refunds or no refunds on cancelled bookings, failed to honor the original booking price, or the price increased after booking, and failed to provide effective and courteous customer service. FareDepot's customer service manager responded to our concerns stating they were addressing these issues and working to resolve them.  He stated that when a refund ""is under process by the Airline or the bank the transfer of funds is not in our control"" and that they are working on a different method to satisfy ""the customer as soon as possible.""  In regards to pricing changes, he claimed that some changes were due to consumers not providing the necessary documents required to complete transactions and that prices changed consistently in this industry; sometimes multiple times throughout the day.  Lastly, FareDepot claimed that some difficulty in obtaining customer service was due to a misunderstanding of their customer service hours.  They are currently adding business hours of 9am to 9pm (EST) through various media channels to make this well known.

BBB would like to acknowledge the recent efforts of the business to resolve outstanding complaint matters and will continue to monitor complaints to discern if the fundamental issues of the pattern of complaints are resolved.

Hilton is an incredible brand but their point system needs a major upgrade. I’m missing 4 stays in the past two years. | I stay at a Hilton property at least one night a month. That’s at least 12 nights a year. This year they downgraded my status from gold to silver. …not really happy about that. THEN the app asked me to turn on “allow tracking across apps” to they can “share” my information to their partners. Yeah, sharing is not caring. It’s selling my information to the highest bidders. No thank you. 

When my car was stolen from in front of the Hilton Garden Inn, in Memphis (Cordova), TN, I got no support from Hilton. Not even an “our sympathy”. | Been using this app for 2 years now and I moved over from Marriott. The quality is next level. | So, it does work sometimes but there are some flaws one of them very serious. The app frequently locks up. Now you have to reboot the phone and start over. If you do get through the booking process and try to use the so-called digital key you're going to spend lots of time out in the hall. They do honor their listed room rate and give you the local taxes down to the penny however once you check in they are going to overcharge you. You will not know how much the overcharge is until you check in. Too late to shop around. If you complain they will tell you it's for incidentals. This is textbook credit card fraud. I filed a complaint with the credit card in order to recover my money.  Beware.... | Being a Hilton Honors member has been a rewarding and enjoyable experience. I appreciate their dedication to quality customer service. | Whenever my family needs a quick getaway, we can always count on the Hilton hotels for their cleanliness and comfort. | Very friendly desk associate
Enjoyed the Happy Hour | Harrisburg Hilton always accommodates our business meetings so well | Easy to book a room and then use a digital key with the app | Staff is very hospitable. Always enjoy my at this location in Morganton, NC. | I am thankful for the staff at all of the Hilton hotels that I have had the pleasure of spending the night. I am a diamond member, and can say that I have only had awesome experiences and would highly recommend this chain of hotels. | The app is very user-friendly. Use it on all my trips. | Everything works | Always a pleasure and nice rooms. Small Refridge, micro, big TV, bedding is perfect.  Nice Bathroom set ups. Great place to stay.  Only thing missing, is a safe, but its Vegas.  Lol. | Hilton always makes it so easy to travel. Everyone is always so friendly reservations to make changes easy to make and they always make things right when they are wrong. | Love my Hilton app. 
Hilton app has been consistently an excellent performing app over the last 6 years | No reason that US hotel prices can’t show fees AND taxes. Have a toggle at least like marriott | These are the kindest, most helpful people I’ve ever experienced at any hotel ever. And I’ve slept in 100 hotels in the last five years. The crew there day or night are always thoughtful and they’ve even gotten to know my name which is always special. | We just love the benefits as diamond members with Hilton their first class and it’s always an enjoyable experience. Very rarely. Do we ever have anything negative to say, and we’re honest honest upfront people when it comes to our reviews. | The only goal of reservations and Diamond services is literally to do nothing but give you the run around | Wish Honors would offer deeper discounts for members! | Efficient and fast. | Download this app now. No matter if you regularly  stay at the Hilton or only make trips once a year. This app gives you all of your keys digitally, allows you to check in and out. Message the hotel. Look for things to do. Order Lyft. I mean the possibility’s are endless. Plus it saves on key cards and paper so more environmental. They give you digital keys and they can be used to enter hotel, room, pool, elevator etc. it gives you access to all the amenities on site. | Super easy to use! | Wish the digital keys actually worked properly. | While I enjoy the facilities and the staff are amazing at most Hilton’s, the rewards program is a scam. You could spend your life savings at their hotel and only qualify for one or two days rewards. Find a better reward program through a website or credit card. I’ve even tried to redeem my points only for certain locations to cancel and falsely claim they were sold out- a quick internet search proved they lied. Customer service still hasn’t answered why I was lied to and denied service that time. Choose another App/Hotel please! | Like the app. Easy to use since we have Hilton Honors. | 如果有其他的语言版本会更好一点 | Totally disrespectful and unhappy

Hilton uses every effort to NOT give a price match even when proven over and over to 3 different reps! | They spam you with popups that direct you out of the app while trying to book a room….deviating from the sale during the immediate process is idiotic not to mention annoying… | always friendly staff
always clean rooms 
always comfortable lobby
always delicious food
always great coffee
always safe parking
always operational laundry
always treated like family
always clean pool/gym
always welcoming | Easy to use the app | I travel for business a lot and I almost always find Hilton to be the very best choice. | I’m giving the app a try and checking in early: looking forward to not waiting in line and having a digital key. Now I have to learn how to share the key with my roommate… | I love how seamless Hilton has made it as a business traveler. Great rooms and amenities awesome food when you’ve been traveling all day and amazing customer service all the time..thanks Hilton! | This Kunming Airport Double Tree is an exceptionally well managed hotel.  Initially, I had difficulty contacting the hotel via phone from US.  Later, we connected via email even WeChat.  The Assistant Front Desk Manager, TingYu Chen, went out of her way to give me the best possible service.  My flight’s arrival time was 2:30am.  She scheduled a shuttle and driver held the sign with my name waiting at the arrival hall.  The staff at hotel are all professional, friendly, and helpful.  The breakfast was full of varieties and delicious.  This is my first time in Kunming.  Double Tree definitely made me feel at home.  Hilton, keep up your great work.  I am a very proud and satisfied Hilton Diamond member.  Thanks! | Hilton is one of the worst chains now.  I was close To diamond for life status, but the service, cleanness, hidden costs, etc were getting so bad I have decided to just finish using my outstanding points and never go to a Hilton property again, if possible.  And yes I did try to work with customer service but the form letters and bots I was writing to made it a more unpleasant experience. | I travel. A lot. I used to use IHG and Wyndham but I’ve switched to Hilton and can’t stand to stay anywhere else.

Key on your phone, check in and out without ever hitting the front desk. It’s awesome.

Occasionally Digital Key won’t be working, and that’s a small hassle. But 90% of the time, I come and go with no issues and the rooms are always nice and the gyms are almost always killer!

Cheers! | Please give me the ability to change dates instead of having to cancel and rebook the stay. | You can’t go wrong with a Hilton property 99% of the time. Your stay will be flawless. The staff is always friendly, the room are always clean. Hilton is my go to property on the road. | The ease and convenience provided an an Hilton Honors member makes me feel valued | It always make me go to the front desk , so why they even offer the digital key for … frustrating 

Horrible service | Could not change away from my Army email address without calling customer service. Retiring. Need to start using civilian. | I travel for work and live in Hiltons. The app gives me everything I need: directions, digital key, organizes my stays and shows me my points. | The Hilton app has so much easy to use features to make stays more convenient . Thanks | Great-Love Hilton | I love this app !!! We use it to book all our vacation stays.. it has not failed us yet!!! Thank you | I LOVE the convenience the app allows by sending an alert when check-in is available and allows you to pick your own room! Easy, quick, and I won’t have to stop at the front

U get a really high number. | I need to cancel 1 members flight in my reservation. Instructions say task can be performed on line. I have looked numerous times through the menu options…..no “divide reservation” option I can find. Big time waster!!! | Thanks for making this easy now. Let’s hope it all goes good. | Ever since I paid for an early upgrade, SWA now gives me the worst assigned boarding position trying to force me into purchasing the upgrade. I just checked in for my next flight before my travel partner and she was given a boarding position 21 positions before mine.
This is a horrible and unfair business practices by SWA!!!! | The App is very easy to work with. One can cancel fast, re book, add the “early bird check in” . | SWA is the best service airline.  Ben if there’s a delay I’ve been notified not to come to the airport.  The people are friendly and try to keep us travelers happy. 

Ray Kaufman | Spent over an hour attempting to upgrade my boarding pass.  Attempted on PC and received a payment error.  Was able to upgrade my companions boarding with the exact same payment information.  
Attempted again to upgrade my pass and Error stated to call customer service which I did.  They informed me they couldn’t help me.  Attempted to add other forms of payment with them all being errored out.  Attempted on mobile app and received error messages.  
You must do better.  
Shut everything down and attempted again on the mobile app and it finally went through.  There must be a better way 
Thank you | The Best! | Helpful but nothing special. | Final annual post on this topic for the SWA app; when upgrade options are presented at time of check-in, none of my stored CC’s allow me to purchase the upgrade. Instead I am forced by the app to re-enter the same CC number again. This appears to be either an issue with the Zip Code field mapping or the CCV’s 3 digits not coming across for those ancillary purchases (which throws an error). Would love to see SWA fix this before 2025. | Best, most friendliest airline ever. Have been flying with for 40 years and have never been disappointed! | Almost good | When it came time to check in, the app said I wasn’t online when I most certainly was and it took me 10 minutes to get checked in so I got a bad boarding pass | Very convenient check in process.  2 mnts. | At least for my iphone i have this issue. Otherwise mostly gets the job done. | You can do just about anything from the SWA app. Easy to navigate! Highly recommend. | The app is not good compare to other airline keep on circulating need to improve a lot guys | My TSA pre check (Global Entry) never works when I travel on Southwest. Alternatively, I often fly American Airlines and the pre check works every time. | A great company | Love, love Southwest! Best staff, best rates, and very easy to book! Thank you!! | For every place I go, I fly S.W.  I use points and  enjoy everything about it.  Flights are always good and everyone is so nice.  I just wish I got drink coupons.  Thanks Southwest Airlines!! | Could not get my boarding passes on my phone southwest server would not respond | Southwest is a great airline -seats are nice -fares are good and it’s so customer friendly with being able to reschedule flights! Also their luggage policy is amazing! | Always love flying with SouthBest airlines!  Friendly, reliable, and their app is great! | The app is very user friendly | We have not traveled recently. When we used it today, the APP appeared to be very improved. Keep up the good work! | Donna!!
Thank you for helping me book my flights with the companion pass while my iPhone 8 struggled to make it happen. Great experience! Such a jovial spirit! Southwest is lucky to have you!! 
Cheers! 
Bryan Weathers | Love flighting with southwest.  Everyone is very welcoming. | SW is it | Love this airline | We always travel southwest! Everyone is so friendly, and we love Southwest!❤️ | I appreciate so much that there is no charge for changing a flight, unless that flight has a higher price. It’s so convenient to use and super easy. | I tried to update my Global Entry number and thought it was accepted. I got my boarding pass, and my pre-check did not appear. This happened the last time I traveled when the desk “updated” it and it still didn’t work. You have a problem. | Not enough bag drops at phoenix airport. Long lines and rude attendants. | Great for tracking your travel plans. But the check in experience in the app is so slow so I always get b group. I have been flying SW for 15 years religiously and I have gotten meticulous about checking in at the 24 hour mark. Lately that has jut not been enough! But as I was watching the airplane circle of doom load my boarding pass I realized this part of the problem. 
Otherwise great app and very convenient to have on hand for checking flight times etc vs digging through emails. | Always a pleasure! Love the sense of humor that’s always happening with staff and the whole atmosphere of southwest! | Using the Southwest app, I tried to check into my flight using the provided confirmation number. I kept getting an error. I had to go back into my email and look to see if there was a different confirmation number and there was. This delay caused me to be very late in checking in and will be one of the last to board.  Why put a confirmation number with the app check in if it’s going to be the wrong one? | They have the quirkiest policies and make travel cumbersome and irritating.  Delta is my preferred airline and is worth the extra cost, but my company makes me fly Southworst because they are the cheapest airline.  You get what you pay for. | Sometimes hard to check in if everyone else is checking in at the same time, but otherwise it's a good app. | Thanks for the great convenience and service | It’s my go to airlines 😊 | It would be great if you would just keep me logged in | I payed and got a message that I had been upgraded just a few minutes after the 24 hour window, however it didn’t show up on my boarding pass. After 2 phone calls because my first call was dropped after 20 minutes. I was told that there was nothing they could do to fix the issue. My bank account was charged and I got the message that we had been upgraded.  Very very poor customer service! Very disappointed and frustrated for my wife and I. No help!!!!! | Just got my companion pass and was able to add a companion to my existing reservation!!! Easy to use! Works great! | Title says it all | I’m going to quit flying Southwest Airlines. The worst check in procedures. The last 3 flights I’ve had to add something like passport, address etc. before checking in. I will find another airline to fly next time. | Lost my A station and early bird… | Always get a B or C boarding position regardless of how quickly I check in online. Southwest card holder and it does not appear to provide any benefit. | It’s horrible that now you have to go through extra steps just to check in! What happened to you just clicking “check in” and you get your boarding

Rarely do I have any issues. | Bonvoy app makes it easy to manage my trips and see my points. 

Future idea I would love to see - it would be so cool if the app had a digital fitness component to workout in my room when I travel. Y’all should look into Sworkit! | Good stuff | App was changed several months ago, requiring changes in security settings on my iPhone. No other app had that restriction. Older version of the app worked on my iPad until recently when I was required to update it. Now I have same “security” issue on my iPad. App is now unusable on both devices and has been deleted. Quite, quite disappointed in the app and in the company. | We have been using the Marriott Family of Hotels for 30+ years. In all that time, I have only been disappointed once with a Marriott Hotel. We have stayed on average 50+ nights every year. Marriott Hotels are the most comfortable and have the friendly staff of any hotel chain we have experienced. Kudos to Marriott Hotels and Vacation Club Resorts! | Had my account hacked and used more than half of my points but I was able to cancel and customer service was great, thank you so much!!! | Love this App and love Marriott Bonvoy and all participating hotels worldwide !!!! | The app is great, but I should mention the policy to treat me like two different people whether I am staying with you as a flight attendant or as a civilian is very uncomfortable. I have earned my status over decades very close to ambassador and exceeding platinum for life, many thousand of dollars spent. Most of the time when I come to your hotels you treat me like I am a first time customer and don’t acknowledge me in any even though I know you know who I am, (I’m in the app) no breakfast no lounge no welcome gift, sometimes no points even when I am paying myself. I think it is wrong for you to treat me this way when I am staying with you and wrong for you to contract with United Airlines to undermine my status. It seems you have met at high level to plot to demean the status I have earn with my loyalty. It is unjust, immoral, and an interference in our business relationship for you to meet with a third party United to undermine my relationship with Bonvoy. You have been doing this sporadically for decades, but the bad behavior has now reached a crescendo. While you are capable of a five star performance you treat me At at two star level more than half the time I stay with you. | Marriott is my home… I believe I stayed more times at Marriott rooms worldwide than at home. Marriott made me feel at home 99% of the time. Thank you! Medhat | I love the hotels and the experience my Texas stay was my favorite so far | As a loyal Marriott customer I really appreciate how easy their app is to use. | She has been the most wonderful host and I love that she will take the time for her customers. I truly appreciate her dedication. | Can do most anything but gets a little glitchy when sharing mobile keys. | I have been a loyal dedicated customer and believer and Marriott and the Marriott organization. I travel along business for the last 2025 years as well as all my vacations, if I up all of my stays, I have a lifetime of Marriott , my family loves to spend time with me at Marriott properties. We feel comfortable and at home with that keep up the good work thank you Marriott . | Used to work no problem but for over the last year I get a security message anytime I try to open the app. Tried updating the app as well as IOS with no luck. Can use it on my iPad but not my iPhone which is not convenient at all. Use Hilton instead.. it actually works | I used to have the app on my iPhone but then one day it refused to open based on some security message I was getting. I felted the app and then attempted to download it again but the system won’t let me. Keep getting the security issue message. Any thoughts on what could be the problem? | This app is very easy to use! I love it. | It’s my first time using the APP 
Its friendly use and I like it 🙏💯🙏💯 | Marriott’s reward program is clear and concise in its presentation and its parameters. Reward attainment is more realistic than other reward programs in my opinion. | The app is slow and has glitches. I tried to update my credit card it wouldn’t allow. Also I was supposed to be a Gold level, but show’s regular. Called customer service they said the system had omitted my level upgrade and to allow some time. I waited a week , it’s still not updated. 
Pain in … to use it. Booking is way easier, less costly and more convenient. | App and desktop website stutter at times which can be very annoying. Would appreciate updated pictures of locations. | All the information I need is summarized very well in this app | We have had issues with the app on a trip. Spoke with approximately 7 different people. We even received an email to login in on a laptop however we don’t bring laptops with us on trips. The issue has never been resolved so I’m going to use all my points and start staying at other hotels! | My stay at The Whitley Hotel is everything!  I would recommend to ALL of my family & friends 💯 | Its always there when you need it | - G | Better than the website! App allows you to choose up to 4 options such as AAA, Senior, points and corp code and displays all the area properties with the lowest price of the 4 first. Beats having to toggle the EDIT STAY button! | Eric at check in was awesome. Very courteous and made check in really smooth. Answered questions and was helpful. With the lack of customer service across all industries Eric certainly exemplifies it. Overall a great stay. | BRING BACK THE OPEN EXPLORE MODE, allows people to freely explore locations around the world on the map without searching areas and dealing with filtering. | My husband and I have enjoyed watching our travel points grow, we also enjoy being able to travel with our family and friends by using the points the we have earned.  The other wonderful thing about traveling with the Marriott Bonvoy app, is that all of the properties, no matter the price, have good standards. | Very good | Top quality staff | Been using the app forever. Super easy to use! Wish all apps were this easy. Well done to the developers. | Thanks for a wonderful stay and a special birthday girl celebration. The chocolate bar was a delightful treat as well. Loved it! | This app has a terrible missing stay request process. Your have to log in twice before you can even get to the request form. Is this to make it harder for their members to get credit for their stays? Seems likely. Uploading the form has not worked on my IOS products. Very frustrating! I expect better from Marriott. Hyatt and Hilton here I come. | This app keeps getting better! | The recent Marriott app for iPhone forces user to turn on 2-step authentication. 
When I tried to turn it off, the app immediately asks me to Confirm Identity by calling Marriott Customer Support. I also can no longer login to Marriott from my laptop. Please remove this 2-step authentication and NOT FORCE USERS TO USE IT. I now have to WAIT FIVE DAYS BEFORE I CAN LOGON AGAIN— this is what MARRIOTT Customer support told me! Makes me want to void my LIFETIME PLATINUM ELITE STATUS!!! | Love Bonvoy !!!! | Nice experience. | Very Convenient for booking, checking in and out. | The app is easy to use and saves time for me traveling often. | This Marriott App is so easy to use. I love it and would recommend to anyone! Please get setup! | Love the app and the perks that come along with being a member especially the higher up you get. I travel for work which makes it easier for me to gain status and get points. BUT… for whatever reason you don’t receive the bonus points that you pay extra money for. Especially the 2k everyday deal they offer at Courtyards. I’ve been a member for 7 years and still if I don’t call everytime and make sure then i don’t receive the points but yet they have no problem taking the extra money you paid for the bonus points.

Can not get out of my account!  Not user friendly!!!! | Lately every time I go into this app, I can’t sign into it and I can’t book a reservation so I just go with a  different hotel brand. When the app doesn’t work, you tried to use the web browser and it still says the systems down so obviously Marriott doesn’t care very much about reservations if they can’t get their act together. | I do feel like I get slightly better service at Marriot hotels because of my membership. | Who need a travel agent with this app? So user friendly!!! I plan all my family vacations on it and booking is so easy.
I have traveled the world with my points and the app. You can even chat with the hotel when you are checked in. I even order towels and extra pillows through the app. | If there is one thing your competitor does better is the mobile key. They let you go straight to your room without stopping by the front desk to set it up. That saves a lot of time when you travel a lot.

Some updates fixed it but it is freezing up again. I think it is something to do with loading all the places in the view. The app doesn’t crash, it just becomes unusable. As if the rendering is taking up all the allocated. I have tried reinstalling it already. This feels like a performance bug on client side | Google maps not only becomes worse become dangerous as well. Hey google what you are doing? Flaw is clearly visible when on express lanes combined with normal lanes. Suggest dangerous lane changes which make zero sense. Sometimes suggest dangerous turn with heavy traffic, usually sit and wait for 10 minutes until someone gives way for you. Apple Maps is way better as a software. Google is finished? | For like the last month Google Maps has been running like it’s in offline mode (different voice, less guidance, no street names) even though it isn’t in offline mode. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling, signing out and back in, checking all of my cellular/wifi settings and Google Maps settings, but I can’t see why it’s suddenly different. I’ve started using Apple Maps again for new destinations, it’s too stressful trying to navigate a new place and not being able to hear the street names and more detailed directions. I hope there is a fix for this. | I used to work at Google, during which I used Google Maps exclusively thinking maybe I could help improve it. Recently I switched to Apple Maps, and I can’t believe how much better it is. Every PM, SWE, UX on the Maps team should use Apple Maps for driving directions and compare.

I mainly used the Google Maps app for driving. I’m in the San Diego / Los Angeles area, but the experience is consistent in all of California and when I’ve visited out of state. 

Voice guidance is often late. I might be driving 65 MPH in the left lane and hear “in half a mile, take the exit on the right.”

I often struggle to figure out where I’m supposed to turn when I hear “in one thousand feet, use the left two lanes to turn left on <street>”. Many streets are poorly marked and it can also be hard to see their names at night or in poor weather. Apple Maps says “go past this light, and turn left at the next light”.

Apple Maps in general gives more timely and human directions. I was stunned when I first heard it say “turn right into the parking lot”. I didn’t realize that was possible, having used Google Maps for years.

Sometimes Google Maps stops naming roads. “In a quarter mile, turn left”. Or “in half a mile, take the interchange on the right.” I believe this happens because of IP geolocation—if I use a WiFi that a family member has used via a VPN from Russia, Google marks my account as being in Russia, and somehow this affects voice guidance. I know this because it also affected my internal permissions when I worked at Google. It’s gone on for years. Directions this bad are dangerous.

I’m happy to go into more detail if anyone from Google wants to reach out. | Just viewing maps really helps | Keeps freezing on iPhone 13 Pro even with the latest app & system updates. Consider switching now | Update version is annoying. | good | I had a great time coming here the managers at la fitness are amazing. They are very helpful, knowledgeable , and caring. They always make my visit perfection. | The mapping is so inaccurate. Google has so many unnecessary features, but the most important feature, which is the mapping feature is so inaccurate. | First off Google maps is great.  It gets 2 star review because it is lacking a building GPS speedometer.  It is available certain areas according to some entries returned by Google.  Otherwise it is a accurate and correct with its maps and routes. | Calidad | I love the work they do | Do not recommend staying at the new condos in Parkside unless you want the industrial aesthetic from your living room and balcony. | Ironic i am here leaving an actual review..

Googles security and customer service is bottom end. 

Googles team does not prioritize their customers. They ignore all messages to remove false reviews on your business page. 
Once the review was finally removed after 8 months… it still affects our google rating. 

Its been a month since Google has reviewed and removed the false review. Ive left numerous emails and messages to fix our rating. 

Have not heard anything from Google. 

They openly allow fake accounts to leave false reviews. They dont take action to fix this issue that could cause harm to your business.

Ive searched peoples questions about google removing reviews and all the answers are the same “google fixed our issues within 2 weeks”

Those are false answers that googles representatives fill out to make their “employer” look like their doing something…

You are better off starting new and renaming your business/google page rather than dealing with Google’s representatives that dont care about their customers. | The app is getting lost on roads it knew a week ago. Starting on Monday, it kept crashing and also would point the wrong direction on a road and then when I would correct it it would lag horribly and I missed my turn a couple times. I was headed to the San Diego airport so come on that is a commonly navigated route it should have no problem | This has been a problem for a long time. Every time I try to delete a favorite it’s still there. I’ve tried many different ways. | I recently upgraded my iPhone. The first time I used google maps with it Siri was over the top in making Maps unusable and in fact so obtrusive that it was in fact dangerous. Was this in an attempt to force me to use apple’s map app. Who knows. I would not put it past Apple. It in fact would not show a search line with the exception of forcing me to use Siri. This was after I pulled over and had typed in the airport. Thereafter Siri wouldn’t allow me the ability to retype in directions. Only displaying Siri as option to input desired the location. What was that as Siri then refused to complete directions to an international airport because it determined after I started driving that it didn’t know where I had started from. Kept telling me to go to settings to allow exact location which guess what was already turned on. Needs safety fix now. What federal agency needs to be reported to | Seems to be adding random contacts to my phones contacts,despite not having any permissions to do so. | I have been using this app for as long as I’ve had a smartphone like the majority of us. But I don’t know why it crashed every time I use it. I open it, or an address, takes FOREVER to load, finally loads. And then crashes. OR- When I switch to another app for a few seconds, I come back and it’s crashed. It’s impossible to use for more than a minute. I used to be a beta tester but I stopped, thinking that would help, but I think now it’s arguably worse. | I loved Google Maps that it replaced the usage of Apple Maps completely. Lately it has been glitchy and slow where the app constantly crashing when I am just trying to get directions quickly. Google maps has multiple features such as satellite view and access to reviews of the places you’re going to. It is still not enough for me to keep using it after the constant glitches. I have moved on to Waze | I don’t know what is going on with Google Maps, but it just keeps turning in circles and makes it appear I’m driving over houses. It never picks up on where I actually am and just randomly chooses a location to over over. | Google maps direct me to anywhere I want to go easier! | freezing more now tbh this update did  not help | The app, along with other google apps consistently freeze for a minute after a few seconds of use. Even one it starts working it tends to be very slow. | Great App | This app make me mad becasuea it has no no right dreitnds😡make me mad al ye rime😡 | I don’t know why I got such laggy Google maps. I have a new IPhone 15 pro and for three months a had no problem but after that strange things started to happen with an app and only this app. When I open google maps, 5 seconds after that it starts to freeze for exactly 15 seconds, then works again. But after some time, when I continue to use navigation, it happens again and again and only with google maps and no other navigation services. I tried clearing cash, reinstalling app, using different acc, nothing worked. I guess, I just need to change a phone just for this app to start working properly. | This app keeps crashing and taking forever to load. Can you guys please fix that.

You are on the highway, it tell you to get off the next exit, make a left at the end make another left on to the ramp onto the highway you just got off. | Ever since the last few updates the timeline is not tracking properly  and freezes when making edits.. and cant even pull up timeline on my samsung tablet | Ted was amazing guide.

Only the log in page of google map app on iPhone SE 3 doesn’t disappear after I log in. It just stays there and covers the map. I have to cancel the log in to get the map back.

HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 35,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.

Also I would like to be able to filter out the non-passenger flights. | Kind of weird story but I’ve been really scared recently that an astroid will come hit earth, (okay, actually mortified) and this all has helped a lot with my fear. Whenever I get nervous about hearing that sound in the sky, I always assume the worst. I looked up “plane tracker” and this came up and it’s helped me ever since. Whenever I hear planes and get anxious that it’s something else, I just check this app and it makes me feel so much better knowing that I’m safe. On a side note, my dad also loves this app. He and I have genuine conversations all the time about what planes are going where and how we didn’t know about certain routes and airports. We both really enjoy the app, especially since it’s free and anyone can download it easily! Thanks again, I would 100% reccomend this to anyone with the astroid fear or, more commonly, just likes to know cool things about planes and their schedules. | அருமை அருமை அருமை. நீங்கள் விமானம் தொடர்பான செய்திகளில் ஆர்வம் கொண்டவரா!!! இந்த செயலி நிச்சயம் வேண்டும் | Poor | Thank you for being here for  kids that want to fly……and only speak of  planes..!!! | Very groovy watching the planes fly around. Your friends will like it. I like it too. | It works pretty good, I like it | The best app to track planes for a plane lover like me!!!!!!!!! | I love looking at the sky and seeing an airplane and getting to see the plane it is what airline operates it I will sometimes look up my friends flight and showing it to them this has inspired my interest in flying and I am just 11 and I love this app | Sluts | Love planes and this is a very accurate app for flights! | I love aviation and this is the PERFECT game for me | This app is amazing and I would consider giving it a five star but one time there was a plane right over us but it would render even though we lived at the same place were it was going to. But even though that plane didn’t appear on radar I can’t believe how many other planes It knows are near us. Probably someone and many others put years of work and much more Into this app, bravo. This is probably made from a person who is very smart and works at a airport, which would take years of work more than many others. Thank you for reading this
By Ezra | I love this flight-tracking app. Very cheap to get premium. I also love the AR feature. Detailed aircraft description. 5 out of 5 stars! | I’ve been using this app for a while and I’ve seen the competition kind of left them in the dust but now that it’s added live activity I think it’s brought It’s game up to where it should be. | airplane go zoom zoom | Best game you get to see plans so yea | It’s a very good tool to keep up with my family trips. And updates | Wonderful app! Accurate and fun! | Great app to confirm the incoming flight to your gate will arrive. | The new update so nice 👍 | FR is one of the best apps I have ever come across. I use it on daily basis to view the air traffic and locate the flight carrying loved ones. 
 Keep smiling | Can see EVERY airplane on the app that I do in real life! My family can track my plane when flying and I can look at it afterwards to see my patterns and maneuvers!

One bad thing, WAY TO MANY ADDS!!! | My wife and I love this app! It works perfectly and we dream build about where we are going to travel next . our home is in the flight path between JFK and most European cities | Doesn't work and freezes | I like the app because when I see my house I can see what planes fly over but when I do 3D mode it does ent show me the real plane and it doesn’t show the ground sometimes also need subscriptions for like 90% of things it’s really annoying money grab | I sent a message in to flight radar 24 customer support a few months ago and they said that they would not add McGuire AFB after I requested it. but now I look on the app and the base now has details for users to look at. The app it self is incredible and I use it on a daily basis. The one thing I do have to say is flights at Tel Aviv often appear to be stacked on top of each other going 2 knots at around 30,000 feet. Besides that, Flight radar 24 is ,in my opinion, the best app for AV geeks out there. | It takes some time for the earlier screen to clear once I open the app before updated current radar loads. Flight information is blank and shows N/A to N/A for clicked commercial aircraft and stays that way for sometime. Also, altitude used to climb smoothly and now climbs in fits and spurts by 250 or 300 foot increments. I’ve recently started to rely more and more on Flightaware and ADS-B which both seem to be more reliable for me. But the in app ads come right up! | Very informative. Would like more on how this information is retrieved. How does it compare to what is seen in the cockpit.  Also, ATC communications would be an added feature. | The best aviation app in the world | This App is great for plane spotting and for Aviation Geeks To Use
I Highly Recommend it | Using it for several years now always a app you have to install. | This is my new favorite way to avoid being social. | This is a wonderful app. You will enjoy the 3D feature that gives you the pilots point of view. | I meet my mom after 20 years I am so excited Waheguruji tera shukar hai | FlightRadar24 used to be a great app, but now they’ve filled it with 30 second ads instead of 5 second ads. Disappointing considering I’m running on a tight budget. | Many thanks to the phone app that lets us know what’s flying by! | Good | Great app for what’s up in the air but sometimes you don’t see any information on it we have helicopters because of the hospital coming over sometimes it on the app and sometimes they’re not. It’s very frustrating. | Title says it all. Everything you could ever want in 1 app. Excellent! | This is my absolute favorite app! So interesting! | Love This app , I can check at anytime any flight that flys over my house! | My son is training for aviation. At the beginning we were able to track his plane and now we can’t. | planes are coolz | I love this app! As a certified aviation geek, I find this information very useful and interesting.

498151501,"com.samvermette.Transit","Transit • Subway & Bus Times","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transit-subway-bus-times/id498151501?uo=4","Transit is your real-time urban travel companion. Open the app to instantly see accurate next departure times, track buses and trains near you on the map, and see upcoming transit schedules. Use the trip planner to quickly compare trips - including options like bus and bike, or metro and subway. Get alerted about service disruptions and delays for your favorite lines, and save frequently used locations for trip directions in a tap. 

HERE’S WHAT THEY’RE SAYING
""Gives you the best route to where you want to go"" - New York Times
“You won't realize how much time you can save planning until you use this app” - LA Times
“Killer app” - Wall Street Journal
""MBTA has a favorite transit app — and it's called Transit"" - Boston Globe
“A one-stop-shop” - Washington Post

AND HERE’S THE WORD FROM PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERS
“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car.”
“Blows Google Maps out of the water.”
“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”

 6 GREAT THINGS ABOUT TRANSIT:

1) THE BEST REAL-TIME DATA
The app uses the best transit agency data sources like MTA Bus Time, MTA Train Time, NJ Transit MyBus, SF MUNI Next Bus, CTA Bus Tracker, WMATA Next Arrivals, SEPTA Real-Time and many more. We combine that data with our fancy ETA prediction engine so that you get the most accurate real-time info possible for all transit modes -  including buses, subways, trains, streetcars, metros, ferries, ridehail and more. Prefer to travel on two wheels? With GPS, you can see live bikeshare and scooter locations right on the map. 

2) TRAVEL OFFLINE
Bus schedules, stop locations, subway maps and even our trip planner are available offline.

3) POWERFUL TRIP PLANNING
See fast and easy trips combining buses, subways and trains – the app even suggests routes that combine multiple options in one trip like bus + bike or scooter + metro. You’ll find great trip plans that you never even considered! Don’t like to walk a lot or use a certain mode or transit agency? Personalize your travel in the settings.  

4) GO: OUR STEP-BY-STEP NAVIGATOR*
Receive departure alarms to catch your bus or train, and get alerted when it’s time to get off or transfer. When using GO, you’ll also crowdsource more accurate info and real-time ETAs for other passengers– and rack up points and thank yous for being the most helpful rider on your line.  

5) User Reports
See what other riders have to say! With millions of users contributing, you’ll get helpful info on crowding levels, on-time performance, the closest subway exits, and more.

6) Easy Payments
Pay your transit fare and buy bikeshare passes directly in the app in over 75 cities.

The sun has incinerated the last remaining snowflakes of Canada’s winter. Which means Montreal’s super cyclists have escaped from their exercise-bike-equipped basements and taken back the smooth tarmac of Circuit Gilles Villeneuve from the F1 racecars. Sometimes we ride down on our fixed gear bikes to watch the roadies pedal in circles for hours and hours in their skintight suits, like they’re training to be the prettiest horse at the Kentucky Derby.

Back home at Transit HQ, we’ve made the usual spring cleaning adjustments, and more:

- We’ve added bikeshare fare info to the app (in select cities, more to come) so you can see how much a ride on those metal tanks will run you
- New iOS emojis have been christened and added to our GO nickname generator
- Real-time data for nearby lines should now load a picosecond or two faster (by prioritizing downloads for visible lines first, and then downloading real-time for ones further away as you scroll down the list of lines)
- Other bug fixes and aerodynamic improvements

Rate us five stars to put Sriracha in the roadies’ bike bottles for extra motivation.","5.15.16",0,"USD",true,889728710,"Transit App, Inc.","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/transit-app-inc/id889728710?uo=4","https://transitapp.com?utm_source=appstore-us-en&utm_medium=store&utm_content=marketingURL",4.63983,"Los motoristas cambian la ruta y no es la misma de la aplicación | Timing is everything and it’s sometimes right on the mark but then the other 65% of the time it’s off by 15 or more minutes. If the weather was bad and this happened I could understand. But for example take quite Sunday and this happens you might have the time to spare but during the week it’s a pain. I’m using the Apple 13 and still have poor coverage using this app.
Also, notice the bus drivers are part of the problem. They don’t stay on schedule. | 4/24/2024 latest version ONLY works for “Leave Now”. Tried several time using “Arrive by” and briefly routes flash on then disappear. “Leave at” shows only one route that is more than one hour later than the time set. I am near several popular bus routes, so Transit is wrong. Not sure why I keep trying to use this app…
11/7/2023 Unfortunately, updated to the latest version 5.15.6 and now unless you leave now, routes flash on for a second and then disappear to NO routes. That is setting to arrive on the next day @ x time. There still is NO GO button despite their claim to have fixed it. Just gets worse. 10/28/2023 There is no “GO” button. Can’t choose a route… 12/5/2020 latest update show all “other modes” when those are all “off” (unchecked). So much stuff canNOT read map. Just more uselessness… 6/5/2020 so a bus line shows a yellow triangle alert but the alert shows every line but the line the user is planning to take. Note: the alerts include other transit services NOT the transit service the user is looking at in the app. Also, the alerts are beyond the city the user is trying to use transit. Use a different app or just walk. False ETAs and NO buses: Just walk 12:12 PM response from Transit support is ""we're really only in a position to offer support for the latest version."" So, keep watching the app store 24/7 to catch their random updates. 12/20/2018 Last two days, the ETAs are worse. Waiting for a bus that Transit said ETA was 2 minutes. Waited over 10 minutes and it still showed ETA as 2 minutes. Walked 15 minutes along street of bus route and NO bus(es) passed me. Sent a couple of reports to Transit support and they canNOT understand that time only moves forward NOT backwards as reported in my 12/14/2018 review. In addition, another support rep stated, ""We get all our info from public transit authorities, and sometimes it's not fully accurate."" Basically, they're right and users' authentic experience are wrong. They instruct to use v5 but I already tried that. I'm jumping ship . . . 12/14/2018 ""ETAs = arrival time is before end of bus ride"" -- I reinstalled v4.5 and the ETA of buses were not as erratic. However, on a route, the last bus stop was to arrive at 11:21 AM, then disembark and walk to final destination to arrive at 11:16 AM. Huh? arrive before getting off the bus? No wonder Transit is now so inaccurate, the developers do not know that time moves forward NOT backwards. The app no longer uses my favorite bus lines when creating routes . . . 11/8/2018 after one week with v5.x the times are totally inaccurate. As other users reported, a bus line shows arriving in 2 minutes and while starring at the screen it changes to 50 minutes, then 38 minutes, then 2 minutes, then 96 minutes . . . The new interface is okay, but inaccurate times is no different from me dreaming up any time that I think the bus should arrive so hence, no need for the app. Curious as to why the ETA times via GPS are so wrong with v5 versus v4 of the app. 11/1/2018 v5.0.5 3 stars ""Change (v5) seems to work"": I tapped update by mistake. Knowing some of the issues users reported reported about v5 changes, I was holding off... I read the blog post and then took a looksie. Two years of muscle memory with the old versions, v5 takes a bit to get proficient. I could not delete recent routes. However, I was able to make a route a favorite and then pressing and holding that favorite offered a delete option. That is way too many steps just to delete...the old way was to swipe left and tap the delete button. Please bring that back. Then it froze my phone. After restart, I tried to use it but it froze again. Another restart, deleted and re-downloaded the app. Had to reset my preferences and favorite bus lines. I'm getting the hang of this new version...[iPSE iOS 10.3.3] I'll be updating to iOS 12.x soon. 5/9/2017 v4.x.x 5 stars: ""It just works"" ...in San Francisco. Its GO feature that was added several versions ago is simple to use providing real times vs interval of times with the transit feature of the Maps app. Now, I think public transit or walking over driving. The additional info such as schedules, maps, trip planner etc. are invaluable. 10/5/2016 v3.12.1 working with iOS 7.x again. Thanks for fixing. 9/28/2016 NO longer Works It seems that since the release of 4.0.x the previous version that runs on iOS 7.x NO longer works. It no longer can find my location, therefore stop bells don't work. With all the verbiage of your release notes, a warning about the next update requiring iOS 8 would have been helpful. But I canNOT update my iOS. And shouldn't the previous version still work? Time to delete and find another app. To bad because this used to be good. | For over a week now my transit has been saying “sorry try again in a little “ when I try to use it I’ve deleted and reinstalled it over 5 times and I can’t even get past the provide access step the drivers are accusing me of wanting free rides but I just can’t get my app to work and I can’t get downtown to get a card Plus is it really that hard to send a message on the app saying you don’t have a driver? I’ve stood at stops for hours waiting for the bus that the app said was on its way it’ll give you how long till it gets there but if there is no icon on the route no bus is coming to you but apparently it’s too much to ask to be notified of that | Very rarely do you get a customer oriented driver. They stop where they want, 1 out of 5 times on time. Someone with a clue provide training. | Doesn’t Even Show All Busses On Route Missed 80 Bus Last Week Cause It Never Showed On App | Is bee in very accurate. Safe me to getting late to work | Es muy mala la aplicación no dice bien a qué hora va a llegar el bus | Muy buena trabaja en tiempo real | One of the best apps I use. Always accurate, and I use this app daily! | 54 lakeforest is not always at the time the app mentions, this made me go late to work plenty of times | This bus never on schedule it always late | Highly recommend | Having to pay to see the full schedule, messes up everything for me a person who plans their day around the train schedule, and then for some reason my train only stops at one point now and not my house | Well Done | ， | Muchas veces las informaciones no son correctas y uno se la pasa esperando en vano. | It’s pretty bad when I’m already carrying a bunch of grocery bags and also have to go home and clean before my BF gets home from work. | As a Senior Citizen I completely rely on this app to get to my doctors appointments | Horrible absolutely horrible times are almost never right bus goes from 8 minutes away to 0 minutes away in 2 seconds extremely unreliable don’t download if you want any proper information | Works very nice 😃😀😀😁 | Smd | Bus 62 always late | I don’t have a car so I use this app ALL the time—it’s great! Easy to understand and super helpful. | See above | Transit is one of the best mta apps. It tells you when any transit system is coming just from the people on the train or bus. Although there are some stuff you’ll need to pay for you don’t really need it. | The location bugs out and when there is construction near a bus it doesn’t show near the bus stop. I have go to another bus stop losing time for work. | Trying to force royale and subscriptions for later times.  Ick | They just leave unio station stop so fast seeing you come down the step especially in the morning if your a female they don’t ever give you a grace period and I f your older you need time to get to plat form spot to I’m just saying if I fall I’m blaming it on the metro not  aquire enough time to get to it plus it’s a problem I will start screnshooting times and submitting them appropriately thank you | You harass your users into enabling notifications with this pathetic banner that never goes away. I'm going to smear your worthless talentless product managers faces in dirt.

For the love of god please change this behavior. It's so so pathetic and annoying. Why on earth do you insist on doing this to your devoted PAYING users :( | Helps out a lot | This is the only app for Metro, but you can’t see the lines unless you pay $25. This app is butt cheeks. It shows the lines it wants to show you, but wont let you select the lines you want or need. | The iPhone version in the iPad looks with the letters a little bit chunky.  I don’t think it is too much difficult to release an iPad version you already have the codes of the iPad. | Why do you have to pay | App says that several buses have came and never did, im now late to what i have to go to. | I do not drive but am able to get around allof the downtown area by using Dash buses. I go to Chinatown. Japantown, USC and much more. It is very safe and well kept. | Every time I prepare to use the bus, I use the time shown in the app in regards to when the bus should arrive. 9/10 times it’s incorrect and it’s causing me to be late. Give correct information… | I came ten minutes early to the bus stop because last time I at 4 it came and early and left me. It came ten minutes later and drove pass me and the app said it service ended. | There’s no real time arrival available on this app. | Kind of frustrating | Muchas veces marca que el bus llega en un minuto y cambia a 10 o más. Inclusive hay unidades que llegan y no están en el
Mapa…. 
Carlos | Love it | This app hasn’t been accurate for the subway for months now. It’s really annoying. | Why do I have to pay to see a bus that I take everyday. You guys are ridiculous. | The bus 42 is always late | it never works rightly | This transportation helps you to get anywhere, either buses or trains etc, whatever area you are living the Transportation App is your best option. | I have missed my bus countless times from this app. Whether it says the bus has already left the stop but hasn’t even arrived yet, or the time skips from 10 minutes to 3 in the blink of an eye so I have no chance of catching it.. this app has caused me to miss so many of my classes. And by the way, why is there no option to just display what time the bus will come? That would be way more useful than reading “27 minutes” and needing to do math in my head to figure out what time to leave. | Great app and very accurate | Not accurate . I could explain in one example-Bus Q35  going from Brooklyn college to Rockaway at 4 pm.Your app show ,that bus will be in 5 minutes,then is show 0 minutes,but bus didn’t show up and at this moment there is a sign 75% accurate,then next bus will be in 19 minutes.19 minutes passed and your application show 0 minutes again and the there is no bus. You continue to wait and your application show 0 minutes ,then 0 disappear and now is 5 minutes for the next bus.What is good about your info if is not correct .Complaining to the bus service has no results either-they just lied ,that traffic is big and they sorry, but there are no improvements,so is a trains and NYC ferry.Very disappointing.",4.63983,512559,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5d/14/3a/5d143a50-8897-a0fb-b8fe-5efe830d1eb2/48d0213a-99fe-49c8-8466-2b82927ccb71_US_EN-S1-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/5e/25/eb/5e25ebc2-164b-46a6-218c-d06f0028c1ee/3eae367a-fd22-4add-b93b-7a67b05a9d3a_US_EN-S2-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d2/cf/7e/d2cf7e4d-f556-6dd5-6ac9-10c50a11b738/f000fa45-af82-4bb0-ab6e-4b672deb8bbd_US_EN-S3-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/65/e8/e2/65e8e21e-748d-01e8-9b40-b31b8b1c5b24/6454f654-51f6-4df6-be85-5fed38590cb3_US_EN-S4-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/72/4c/58/724c581d-b972-1e00-ccb0-85aeee4636bf/251fd8e8-ad56-4ea4-a100-a48649551cd8_US_EN-S5-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a1/fb/ee/a1fbee13-f200-28a0-f622-051ca1bef41b/340da1d1-0bef-4d66-8e04-55c984d7d8ee_USA_EN-S6-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/27/c5/06/27c506ee-fc07-7120-e893-1de3587d7d53/8e83ce66-6e5e-45fc-b34c-200e92ec1353_USA_EN-S7-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8d/db/d4/8ddbd445-b263-9362-c127-324032d38421/2697c730-a556-46a1-b3e9-6e771a6c393a_US_EN-S8-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4f/a3/7b/4fa37b06-6bcb-8fb7-0fdf-8249a33731ca/9d114825-03d7-474b-a029-62d04dc07016_US_EN-S9-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e7/a5/61/e7a561c4-7910-b84f-a270-62d91dd111ec/ec9b03f4-9cbf-4cce-978b-50cb825c5168_US_EN-S10-5.5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Prepaid and saved $20.00. Highly recommended app for my iPad Air. Very nice layout. | Thanks for having a deal available that goes away when I download the app. Really appreciate that so appreciate this review | I was looking for a round flight from SFO to Toronto. After picking the flight & paying for everything, I went to the airport & I was asking why in the itinerary there is no return flight info only to find out that they charged me full price only for a single flight rather than round trip. 
Their app and website is a mess with a lot of non-relevant advertisements which makes the booking so confusing.

Stay away from these SCAMMERS!! | Terrible service and no help at all with our 3x delayed flight by spring airlines. When you as travel agency have partners like spring airlines and you allow them to do what ever they want with passengers,than you’re nothing better than them. Took 6 hours in delayed flights like tomorrow we do t have obligations to do in location where we traveling. Good bye trip.com thanks to your precious partners who don’t respect their passengers time | Trip.com is an all in one travel app. This app manages every aspect of your travel, from bookings, to travel suggestions & excellent customer support. My only regret is that I didn’t download this app earlier. Don’t leave home without it. | Difficult to navigate. Not even sure what this is. | The policy is different than the Chinese version Cyril. There is no protection for flight cancellation and change. | I have 0 trips pending.  Yet, unless I’m in the app, it is the only notification allowed in the bar.  Close the background and it still persists.  Other apps can’t seem to get in there unless i delete Trip from my phone. So  I did. I then reinstalled it, and what do you know, still no relief. 

 I’d love to send a screenshot of the other apps I’m actually currently using while this garbage notification trashes up my notification bar. There’s some reason you think i want your app in my face when I’m not using it and have no need for it? | They screwed up our ticket they didn’t issue it. They said they would give you a bunch of coins as a refund and pay the difference between the new ticket you had to buy they didn’t do any of that terrible company liars. | They claim up to 50% cheaper then other it’s lie they actually cost 50% more then other apps , best deals you will find on skyscanner I want to fly to Europe this summer and skyscanner same dates $1040 and this app(trip) $1600 cheapest and there is 4 passengers difference $2300+ so this app is junk check it for your self | I booked flight with this company my second leg of the flight got cancelled leaving me stranded over night. Neither this company nor the airline that canceled was really concerned about how my husband and I got from Denver to Washington. I filed a dispute with the company and they refunded me yet. Trip.com kept the money and when I filed a dispute with PayPal, they lied and committed fraud and see it, the flight was never canceled even though I had proof. Do not use this company. They are scammers and are not for their customers. | Do not download this. Their human customer service is so useless, you’ll be wishing you were dealing with an AI bot instead. The experience is akin to being the protagonist in a Kafka novel. | If you traveling around Asia. You better use this app. | User friendly, good customer service and best prices | I’ve been using this app for well over five years with great results. I use it to take about four trips a year to different places. I normally get my confirmation within two hours. But if I book with multiple airlines, it sometime takes a few hours longer.

I just booked my latest flight and hotel and everything worked out great.

I noticed that I no longer have the option to select sending it to my Apple wallet or to my calendar. 
The option put the flight information into my calendar with the date and times of the flight. It also put my hotel information for sign in and sign out. It also put the ticket information into my Apple wallet, which was convenient when I went to the boarding gate. 

These options was very good and made the program nice and easy to use with my Apple iPhone.

So, 🙏🏻can I have them put back in or what are you going to do.

I still enjoy using the app.🫶🏻👍🏻👊🏻🤛🏻🤟🏻 | There are trash don’t use this app 
They will tell that they didn’t have tickets available at 2pm but my original reservation was at 10am 
Please don’t book anything with them 😡😡😡😡 | I was going to book through this app but what I read on the reviews I’m good I rather continue looking | All of the stuff was great and the my stay wonderful | i ma currently in China alone for my first solo travel i am young and new to everything i have ZERO internet access to anything so i must use trip.com to book and this horrible application keeps saying my payments are failed with every single card i own when i have but i get charged over and over and over for things i don’t get then i don’t get any receipt or nothing in between just a lower bank balance ZERO costumer service and no tickets | Horrible terrible evil this is a scam site! My father and I bought tickets for the Monterey Bay Aquarium for my birthday using this site. But when we got there, the tickets showed up in the system as returned. This site buys tickets and sells the same ticket multiple times for an attractive price. Thank the gods I was wearing a birthday party hat otherwise they might not have let me in! The staff at the aquarium love birthdays. | Good apps for every traveler experience | Hello I have used this app for bookings staff but I will never recommend this to people ever they are scammers and never try to solve your problems. I hit to use their apps plz don’t use them they gonna put you in big trouble… | Bwst | Impressive features and services. Highly efficient and reliable with lots of offers and affordable travel rates. Great work team TRIP! | Just don’t use this service. No no no. Horrible customer support. Never again. | I use this app extensively while traveling through Asia (South Korea and China mostly). I don’t really have anything bad to say about it. I’ve booked flights, hotels, and trains ahead of my travels, and I’ve never had an issue with checking in or getting tickets. It is my go to travel app for Asia. | Too many adverts from Trip with no way to turn them off in the inbox. Also customer service not very helpful when you had problems pre booking seats on flights | This app will not delete even though I did not sign up for it. They keep sending me spam. This is a crappy app. | I had a flight delay and it affected my whole itinerary.no support is very bad attention no one calls you to warn you and on top of that I had to pay almost 200$ for the flight change them. O are not responsible I do not recommend anyone this application be careful they are scammers . | 航班轉機時間只有50分，根本趕不及，坐不上下一班飛機，結果延誤7小時，還是飛市裡最遠的機場。兩個客服嘴裡說的都好，但就沒有任何實際結果。結果是我在機場浪費半天，更遠是機場廢了更多路費 | Worst, unhelpful customer service I’ve ever had | Great air fare | Only a scheming business would send a flight to ONT instead of LAX to scrape a few bucks off of customers unknowingly booking their flights to the wrong airport. This company needs to go under, they have no way of cancelling a flight within 24 hours of booking. Instead it’s only an “application” for cancellation and even then it’s not a full refund. Classic thieving business tactics. | best super easy to use app for tickets 🥰 | Very good app for price analysis and reservations while you travel | 机票日期📅选错了，为什么不能给退票，哪有这样的，杀人犯还分故意和非故意的，机票不小心选错了日期为什么不给退票，太恶略了。 | Confirmation and changes are fast compared to other similar platforms. 

Well integrated with notifications and reminders. I had a flight ticket awaiting payment and already have a calendar item waiting to be added. | Don’t book on this site. Horrible mistake | First time i used it. Truly i fall in love with this apps as a traveler. | 这平台给我们提供很多便利帮助，也及时给我们带来更新信息，谢谢☺️ | AVOID TRIP.COM AT ALL COSTS!
 
We literally got notified hours before the first leg of our flight was cancelled and our full trip was unrefundable despite not being able to make our connection.. we got scripted responses from customer support telling us to reach out to the airlines ourselves and now we’re out hundreds of dollars… absolute nightmare | Just keep in mind if you ever would need to a change in passenger name or whatever they will charge you for additional service, will keep telling automated replies”thank you for your patience” but won’t be able to solve your issue, because they have lots of greyish ticketing offices in the world whose are actually responsible for your booking, but don’t now their location and phone numbers. Also they will offer you 0 refund.  Terrible attitude and service! | Selected hotel on google maps, then selected and downloaded trip.com — automatically placed most expensive hotels in front of my face and “forgot” hotel I was trying to book. Bozos | It was so easy to book my stay at this historic hotel through Trip.com. The price offered was reasonable. I got a rate with breakfast included! Enjoyed the hotel stay and thanks to this platform! | 是我旅行的好幫手 | Garbage app. They screwed up my dates and then wouldn’t refund my money and blamed the hotel. Called the hotel and they said they couldn’t do anything because it was through a third party. Don’t use this, go literally anywhere else | Your first choice to travel all of the world | For hotels they charge you a deposit and tell you what you should pay at the hotel. The price you pay at the hotel is no where near close to what they tell you the price it’s. They do not disclose any fees the hotels may have and they do not advertise them until after you check out and then you can cancel even tho they changed the price. | Very bad app | Is very good and very easy

His car was clean and a good driver. | Likely the best Uber driver I have ever had. | Ótimo | Ótima experiência, ótima pessoa, comunicativa e muito prestativa ajudando o passageiro!!!! | Professional, on time, pleasant!!! | Way cheaper than a dui !!!! | Breanna was awesome!  Very professional, enjoyed the ride | He was phenomenal! Thank you! | Very nice young lady named Thelma gave us a ride. | Very great at times, then at others it’s hard to find someone available | NOT OK | Great ride  thank you | Thank you universe for my Sengali driver made my night!! | Es una aplicación que auxilia en el transporte, da opciones que pueden ser accesibles a todos | After an extremely long travel day, catching an Uber was so easy & convenient.  Its a great, stressless way to travel. | Drivers get lost and never make it you. Drivers accept the ride and then call you, ask you where you are going, and then tell you they can’t pick you up, so you have to cancel. Had a driver go on a sexist tirade about how he couldn’t get hired for a full time job because he wasn’t a woman. For food delivery, one time they assigned the delivery to a bike carrier that was going to take three times as long as a car or more, because it was winter in Colorado and he had to travel several miles uphill…. then I had to fight with Uber for a refund for 20 minutes. | Exceptional service to get from point A to B. Thanks. | Loren was great!
Strong grip 
Good kisser! | Мой аккаунт сломан и мой поездку шифрования получил моя семя | Thank you for your service. | I am so sorry to forget. I I hope this made up for it. A true gent, kind man, great driver and god fearing man. | Marcus was very informative friendly on our ride from the airport to downtown Chicago.  He talked about the city, the buildings, the neighborhoods, and more. Very pleasant and enjoyable ride. We highly recommend him. | Alex is such a nice person! Friendly and informative ~ | Enjoy riding in the Tesla | Excellent driver, most enjoyable ride. | Very patient and kind. A1 driver in my book where expectations are high. | Beyond smooth | Our driver was amazing and his service and professionalism was a true 5 star experience! | Brian was awesome!! | Great ride . | Why not just say “no driver available” versus waiting for seven minutes for the app to keep refreshing and say “no driver”?

So yesterday the app couldn’t find a driver and I didn’t even notice that I was getting text that the driver was on their way, but the app kept saying trying to find a driver trying to find a driver trying to find a driver. So unfortunately canceled it on him but after I canceled it, I noticed the text that said he had been coming so I tried again, and I waited till the driver showed up. The entire 14 minute trip. It said I was at the hotel and the app was trying to find a driver. | Was very prompt and knew how to get me to airport quickly and on time. Great service‼️👍🏻 | Ron was very nice and had great a great conversation. I hope to book him again. He showed up right on time too. | I redownloaded the app. Part of logging in is entering the security code on the back of the last credit/debit card you used. If you no longer have that card then you’re just screwed unless you want to sit on the phone with customer service for 3 hours. Gonna use Lyft instead | Very kind spirit. Great conversation! | Que curioso encontrarse con otro maratonista, la plática se torna amena. 
Gracias por los tips para correr el Marathon de Madrid 👍🏼 | Communication was good, he let me know when he picked up and dropped my son!
As per my request he also  checked with him to see if he had his key.
Thanks Ron | I had the best Uber driver that you can possibly have | The driver was professional and got me where I was going in an efficient time. Highly recommend! | Thank you to Annette for being available to save the day! I’ve never used Uber before and I needed help getting two people to different destinations on short notice. I’m grateful for her efficiency and being kind to them. | Sunay was on time , clean car and just know what he’s doing. By the way I gave him cash tip. | I’m getting charged $9.99 each month in the health menu it says how to do it but it doesn’t do it. It goes right back to the help menu with its way of telling you how to do it. | Doug was prompt, friendly, and reliable. Thank you! | The experience was amazing!!
I had always been skeptical about this service, but my driver made my experience an absolute joy!
He was on time, friendly, respectful and very professional!!
I will definitely ride with him again anytime!! | Excelente service | On time, safe driving, polite | Great driver, very friendly and drive very carefully | Uber is charging me $9.99 every time I take an Uber I don’t understand why this is happening.

She goes out of her way to support customers and she always treats her runners and hostesses with dignity and positivity like they are part of her team.  This is probably why we see them happy to run around to compliment her service and support.  We also notice that she always provides round trip service to all the tables in her section.  Her hands are never empty.  Her attitude must be a reflection of the management and how they treat their servers and staff. | It's our favorite for special occasions.  We drive 2 hours to get there. Out of all the Japanese steakhouses, we like Brandon the best and also Kobe is the best place we have found compared to other Japanese restaurants that are available | Beep bop boob I’m here | Not sure what happened to the iOS app but mine stopped working and just goes into a “oops” and refresh loop.  I’m on the latest iOS and latest update of the app.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled it and still not working.  Tried to report the issue but can’t seem to do that either.  I have to use web browser to make reservations and it keeps trying to open/relaunch the app on my phone. | Sitting single ladies in the back away from other guests is not a good way to develop clientele. The food and drink were good and prepared uniquely and well but were a bit overpriced. The banquette seat was too low for the table. The applied decorations are several steps below the exquisitely original, restored finishers. Too many staff not properly dressed/trained for the advertised experience. | The sign in process for this app is really frustrating. 
First, you have to provide your phone number, then they send you a verification code. Once you  do that, then you also have to sign in through your email, which they send you another verification code for, but you can’t cut and paste it.

It’s like the mobile experience was total after thought. | Best tuna tartare in town | Love using the Open Table app. It’s very informative and greatly helps pick restaurants that you can enjoy. 
Thank you ! | Easy to access. Easy to use. The reservations are honored | Love it. | Go-to app for fine dining experiences | Craftway in Plano has amazing food and the staff is really friendly. They portray professionalism on so many levels if you haven’t eaten there, you should. It’s a great place for happy hours and other occasions this year we celebrated on the patio with the staff for the solar eclipse. It was really amazing and we really enjoyed it. It’s one of my favorite places to be I can’t express enough how great the food is. | Open table has changed the way you sign in.  You no longer need a password but it wipes your account clean.  I have had them for yrs and now my points are gone and they indicate they can’t find my email account that was tied to the at which is the same account they responded to me via email.  

I had accumulated over 5000 and now they are gone. | Amazing food, This restaurant has a great vibe, really great service. The staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable. The  best restaurant in Fort myers and the surrounding area hands down. | I’ve been trying to login for days. It keeps telling me to check my email for a code but the email never comes. I had to call the restaurant to make the reservation because the app is useless. | I have never had an issue with Open Table at an established restaurant. I’ve used it in other states as well. 
Wish Kitchen Social would join! | 4/20/2024 on vacation got food poisoning At Lombardo’s that we paid dearly for and this makes for a great trip kids throwing up, you throwing up, everyone pooping to death thanks to this place Lombardo’s!  A man reaps what he sows, read the Bible! This place should be checked out for poisoning people! This is a safety hazard to guest tourists and the community! | We had a great time! The wings and margs we delicious. Great happy hour too! | Easy app | Jesus <this app | Had to go through 3 rounds of verification to log in today. Hope this doesn’t continue. | Terrible verification authentication to book a reservation at a restaurant.  It’s easier to call the restaurant and book. | The system doesn’t allow you to add notifications and does not show up in the Apple notifications options. Sadly sticking to Resy to go on waiting list until it’s resolved. | You state you give points for my last 4 meals and you are not giving my points | It’s been awhile, but Morristown’s Restaurant Week got us back to Freddie’s Friday night. Because I waited too long to reserve, we took an early 5:30 seating. We were guided to a sectioned area of 5 tables where my wife and I were seated at a 4 person table. Very comfortable. And to our surprise, next tabled was shared by Freddie himself entertaining two old friends. 
And it got even better after that because we ordered our dinner. Took advantage of the MRW special. From beginning to end, it was delicious. Presentation was beautiful. Service was perfect. We’ll be back soon.
 And BTW, Freddie asked us if we knew any $$$ people who may want to invest in his heart’s desire, a fish restaurant. Well…if it ends up like Morristown’s Freddie’s, are you in?😉 | Open table has been my go-to app for dinner reservations for a decade. It’s so easy and keeps getting better. | Hello, it would be very helpful if this app could support sorting the search results by guest ratings. Otherwise, I get the impression that this business favors the restaurants over the consumers. | Why does it ask me to log in from the app every time on my phone? | This app for some reason doesn’t let me make reservations. I make reservations and it doesn’t allow it to send to the restaurant I’ve tried multiple times and only once it worked.Fix the issue please! | After enjoying excellent cocktails starting the best calamari anywhere, the manager came out to apologize because the chef and he decided that the dish I ordered was not up to par tonight. He suggested I order something else and he would comp my entree. I ordered the lamb chops and they were fantastic. I’ve never had that happen before. I’ll be back. | Just as the TITLE indicates, Easy & Convenient! | As a non-tech person, I appreciate how easy Open Table is to navigate, as well as how it remembers me from reservation to reservation.  Going out is a rare treat for my friends & I; knowing we are expected takes stress & waiting out of the picture.  Thanks! | The chat bot couldn’t answer my question, but never gave me contact information for support. I also could not find this info on line. Finally, it appears that there is No way to change a password | Was very disappointed at last visit for dinner. 
No meat… no steaks or fish were available. 
also, really miss their tri-tip steak salad which is no longer available. | Love to use this site to make reservations, it’s easy and I’ve never had a problem. | I have lived in this neighborhood for over 20 years.first place I think of. Food is delicious as is staff. | Impossible to cash in rewards points.  Tried to get in touch with a human to discuss problem, good luck with that.  Resy is going to kill OpenTable (more restaurants are going to Resy from OpenTable). | Just open the APP and scroll to what sounds interesting…discover new places that welcome you. And if you already have a favorite, almost all are using Open Table. Love it! | Reservations are a snap, plus if you repeat a location, your notes are saved. Even changing reservations or canceling is easy. Don’t know what I did without it! | I love booking via open table. We always get a special seating attention when we reserve via openable. | The app won’t let me proceed unless I write a review, which is annoying | This is is super accessible, accurate and easy to use. Will definitely continue using!! | When I go to get code I get kicked out of the app. Not user friendly! | Why do I have to pay round table to make a reservation then have to call the resturant to make a cancelation. Shouldn’t the cancellation be done through round table? | This is a very good site. Easy to make reservations and get confirmation 
Excellent | Good service and nice atmosphere.  But the tuna in the salad wasn’t fresh.  Very disappointing. | Once I set the date, time, and cuisine, it only gives me a few moments to scroll through the requested list before it resets and gives me a list of all cuisines and I have to redo the whole filter. | Open table has decided they need to make more money from your data. Going forward they will require your first name and picture made public whether you like it or not!

After a week or two of use, I couldn’t believe I didn’t switch sooner. I also like how you don’t have to have an address plugged in and still able to get all the traffic alerts. | Reporting:
A recent update removed the option to report animals on the side of the road, and roadkill. This was definitely useful and I hope they bring it back!!

User interface:
They also recently changed the layout of different report options and while I understand they’re trying to make things easier to report while driving, I had gotten used to where the buttons were so I used to not need to look at my phone to report something. But now it feels like it requires more of my attention since the buttons are all in different places. Would’ve preferred smaller changes over a longer period of time.

ETA/Best routes:
I feel like recently my ETAs have been less and less accurate and I don’t know why. I have ‘personalized ETA’ switched on and it used to be very very accurate. It has been taking me on routes that end up adding time to my drive as well.

All in all, I am NOT happy with recent updates. I used to love this app and would use it for my everyday commutes to avoid any unexpected traffic, but now Apple Maps seems to be a better option. Hope they fix things soon! | This app does not know how to give you directions to the left side of the street. it’s so weird that the only directions I can give you is going around the block when you can just turn left. | This last update screwed up my shared voices. Now I get a default voice and not my downloaded voice when I start my drive. Some of us like to listen to other voices and not the default ones. This is what made Waze the best Traffic/GPS. Now you are taking it away? Allow us to use our downloaded/custom voices! I submitted 3 tickets and no one has responded. | Changes my mood with every wake, sometimes my car icon, please fix otherwise great | regular user here. It never works when I try to set it to go home; it always freezes the screen, and it's necessary to close the app. This issue started after the last update. I've been a loyal Waze driver for more than 14 years, and this has never happened before. I drive 200 miles a day, and I hope you guys get it fixed soon. | Tells us to go one way when the other way is 20 minites quicker. DO NOT LISTEN TO WAZE | The voice stop working on the app. Can you fix the bug. Other than that the app is great | My family and I love Waze!  We all have it on our phones.  I love all the new voice options.  Makes drives more enjoyable.  
I do, however, wish there was a way to disable when on AppleCarPlay.  When I am just running to the store and not using the app at all, I don’t need a notification where the railroad tracks are. | I can’t sign in with Google or any of my emails. Please fix I want to use your app | I keep having to restart my phone and open the app again……  it keeps saying I’m invisible and won’t let me report things….. the only way to fix it is to restart my phone and then it works for a little bit. Otherwise love the app! | Несколько дней назад при начале поездки перестали использоваться кастомная озвучка | No widget, most recent update deleted my self recorded directional voices,  when I use the app in some remote areas as I head to clients it is woefully inaccurate ( Google maps and Apple Maps are now both better). Waze is now almost at delete from my phone status after YEARS of preferring it. Developers giving it a slow death. | I’ve used Waze for years, both in the U.S. and in Europe. It’s saved me a great deal of time by allowing me to find the best ways to get from point A to point B without sitting in traffic for hours. It’s also saved me from numerous speeding tickets by warning me where the cameras and cops are hiding. The latest update I hate. They have the most annoying alert sound now. I don’t want a sound, just a voice alert. I wish the developers would allow you to choose what sound you want but no, you’re stuck with the default sound which is annoying. Still glad to have this app and though its mapping system isn’t perfect it still is better than Google. | This app needs a disclaimer - “DOES NOT WORK IN BOSTON”.  That is all. | Just get it so good for my kids and me | Removed ability to see multiple routes after you start the drive. Big L, loss of main operability and benefit of driving in congested areas | Excellent with route information and great at routing around slow downs. But why can’t a program with access to this much map information deal with time zones when it comes to computing ETA’s. | Longtime user of Waze who recorded custom voices for each set of instructions and alerts. While I enjoy the app, I can’t tell you how much disappointment the most recent update brought by using bell dings replacing the alerts previously provided by voice. | This is one of the best apps i have used | I can no longer find this voice 😡 | The new update has overridden my custom voice direction settings with your default voice. What’s the point of that option if your system is just going to cancel it out? | Waze should do better design the app to better serve EV car users. | I’m going back to the house to go to the gym with the girls for the night so I’ll let you know if you want to come over and help me with the stuff I need to do for you and me and I will be there in a few minutes if you want to come over and help me with the stuff I need to do for you and me and I will be there in a few minutes if you want to come over and help me with the stuff I need to get you done | *** UPDATE*** Finally figured out how to keep this app from restarting itself and draining my battery. 
I deleted the app! 
The last straw was close the app. The time highlights blue again. The app is open. Closed the app. Time highlights blue again. Five times in a row then I deleted Waze. 
NO MORE PROBLEMS.
I don’t need Waze tracking my path from my kitchen to my bathroom. Why does the app keep restarting itself? When I shut off Waze through CarPlay it continues to run. Close the app on my phone it continues to run. Wondering why my battery is dying? Waze started up again. When it use it’s ok. To get it to stop sucking up battery I nearly have to restart my phone. Fix it so it shuts down when desired. | App is fantastic but gets two stars for one reason alone- STOP changing my route without asking! I purposely choose the toll free routes so I don’t spend an extra $8 driving to and from work everyday, and the app switches back to it without asking! Unless you’re going to start paying my tolls for me, this needs to stop. | I use this app a lot to get places. The only problem is you have to be careful especially when driving in the country. A lot of the areas I go to involve going through dirt roads and sometimes it misleads you or makes you go longer alternate routes. The only other problem I’ve had is that it won’t delete my history. I tell it to remove old drives from history and it won’t do it. I have to literally uninstall the app and reinstall it to clear it. | For no reason.  SMDH. | i really wish you can add what apple maps has. | Just noticed today (4/18/24) that the alert for “Hazard Ahead” is no longer a woman’s voice but a soft ding. Sounds like my vehicle is alerting me to something seriously wrong. When in fact it’s the new alert that there’s a car on the side of the road. After eight or so years of using Waze and being accustomed to certain alert sounds,  is you’ve changed it so much I don’t know what it means until I take my eyes OFF the road to read the silent alert. Commuter nightmare! | Been using Waze for 9 years now! I’m on and off w/ Google Maps. I miss Waze’s friend feature, sad they got rid of it. It was actually pretty cool. 4 stars because connectivity seems to be an issue sometimes and if not, the only issue I have (and that’s the reason I hop back n forth w/ Google Maps). Other than that, Waze is the app to use. Their features are better and more user friendly accessing the play by play directions like Map Quest back in the days lol. Google, I’d have to click like 3 diff things to see the step by step route vs Waze I can just click the name of the street and it’ll pull down! Download this app tho | For almost an entire month, the app has not been working. It keeps freezing when I enter my destination and try to start the GPS. I’m very disappointed. The latest update did not help at all. I did the update about two days ago. if it keeps freezing like this, it might mean that they need to increase the amount of bandwidth their servers can take. | BRING BACK ROADKILL as a hazard report | I really love Waze for all the assistance it gives, there’s a big problem..

I intentionally set the settings to avoid tolls..well it actually tries to direct me to tolls and it even tries to get you on toll passing my exit and redirecting me to follow tolls.

It’s pretty irritating.
Please fix. | I really appreciate this app. My sister told me about it. I used it when I traveled to Manchester, New Hampshire. Really smooth navigation. My one issue that I have when I first started this app it had master chief voice. That was the only one I used. Please bring it back.It’s a awesome feature. | I love this navigation app but I have not been able to use it because it keeps saying it is offline. Please fix | For the most part, I love this app. Love that it has more real up-to-the-minute traffic data, and I love to add data/info/hazards, as well.

But some features are difficult to click while driving. When I try to make a closure, it’s too hard to select the specific street/exit/ramp etc that is closed. The app tells you to click an arrow indicating the direction of the closure, and it’s a really small target, and sometimes the arrows overlap. They need to fix this problem. | Waze is the most intrusive app I’ve ever seen. Putting the app to “Sleep” mode means absolutely nothing when using CarPlay. I don’t want to start the app automatically. It’s good to use while driving on the highway and when I chose to use it. It should be illegal and I’m sure it’s not, for an app to start even when you don’t want it to. A user shouldn’t have to play games with other apps just to keep Waze from opening. This app is not humanity’s gift, so the app developers need to stop treating it as if it is. An update to turn this app OFF needs to happen immediately. | Edit 4/17/24 having sound issues, I have no navigation sounds and no alerts. 

Literally have zero problems. Use this map everyday, drive truck for a living, no worries here. Live in one of the worst cities to drive in, and idk why you guys don’t get the proper routes you’re supposed to? I literally get mapped around traffic daily, and never usually have any bugs or problems outside of that. Great work guys! Works like a champ for me! Even with apple CarPlay! | هذا الإصدار لا يعمل على آيفون ١١ برو ماكس | Waze is a great app. But the master chief voice was 50% of the reason this was a great app for me and it really brought back my halo Period. Me and Master chief have covered a lot of miles together and I would like to continue hearing his voice guide me on my expeditions. So please bring chief back so I can continue to Waze | It’s nice to see other wazers and report anything on the road but Waze is Google and I’m afraid for my data. I’m using Apple Maps. It’s way, way better. You can report as well. (also with you voice) It’s much more better than Waze. It’s not Google! And it’s secure. The only sad thing is, you can’t see other people but I can life with that. | My sister showed me this app and I love how easy it is to use. Only thing I wish it had and hopefully I will find in the setting is when you get close to where your going other apps so houses and stuff. It helps me a lot more to see what house versus telling me it’s coming up in .3 or 300 ft. Some houses aren’t clearly marked and that feature makes it easier | Ya could stop putting me on a side road to the interstate every 100 miles and making me think I need to go 35 on interstate 40 but whatever. I’ll take that to getting a ticket from Babylon enforcers. Also the car on side of road helped several of us in a group avoid a nearly nasty accident, so bless up for that. Besides the technical issues this is a pretty dope little app. Especially for free. | Every time I plug my phone into the car for Apple CarPlay, the Waze report function doesn’t work. Nothing pops up anytime I report a hazard or a cop or anything. Please fix this and I will change my review thank you.",4.84797,2996704,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/5b/c9/a9/5bc9a9bc-a950-2318-c5f0-cde4e336b4bc/8a99ba1c-50e1-4521-bef6-8140db5a9936_Screen_01_Pothole_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ad/cc/14/adcc147a-9629-098a-b90f-9b0a14721ebf/14a15076-4aaa-4b60-839f-4cd9017369bf_Screen_02_Reporting_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a7/21/91/a72191c3-c6b7-4691-7603-21e95a94a4ab/55d76f58-7815-4761-9c38-7e9cb759d817_Screen_03_Reroute_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/80/a4/a9/80a4a938-3bd7-c65a-13e4-c1f6fb2d65cf/41eb45b9-3493-48e0-ae68-95c73de0f2a6_Screen_04_Speed_Camera_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ad/e6/af/ade6af1e-31e9-856d-1204-ef0d622a9b54/2f5bba53-5e4c-4f47-9b4d-b73ca9177305_Screen_05_CYD_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3b/be/4a/3bbe4abc-5994-bc3f-a81a-a7f1c458c0cc/a60ae708-2520-47d0-bbb5-ea55605b121c_01-POTHOLE_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/01/1c/60/011c602b-a7a9-15bf-fa0b-2498a48e62a9/8f7fd96d-60cd-4415-aa5c-d4df8344d960_02-REPORTING_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/75/6b/ec/756bec5a-78df-7348-35b2-1e00740d6c23/d406f30c-6490-4323-8810-525a3d0046e4_03-REROUTE_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f4/87/73/f48773bb-864a-ea1c-018e-2b306c1c4764/86b99d5d-7a60-4ed1-b158-118e40c46dc3_04-SPEED_CAMERA_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4f/6e/86/4f6e860c-9f97-8902-15b7-51bb638353a0/5660ff26-0421-488a-9b67-95ade4ef805f_05-COPILOT_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Well that’s not entirely true. We now for the past 3 years shooting each other the top 20 email along with our joke of needing more time off work. The deals are real and we have had several great vacations. Thank you Travelzoo. | Joined under “3 day trial - cancel anytime” and realized quickly that everything was a scam. They will list one price but once you click on it - the price doubles (at least). I’ve spent HOURS looking and every single offer does this. The real kicker is there is no way to cancel the free trial, so I paid $40 to view click-bait. | Travelzoo is an awesome site to get bargains for travel it never disappoints | This app and it’s notifications have saved me time and money.   People are still clueless and afraid of using TravalZoo.  Don’t be.  The deals are real folks.  Don’t wait. | My favorite travel site, I see no reason to look anywhere else. | It show 400$ when you click on it, price jump to 1200$!! | We have used TravelZoo multiple times to go on different Vacations. Very happy with our Trips. There’s no telling how much we saved. This is a great way to see the world! | Love the app | When starting to brainstorm travel, just remember it’s now ok that it’s a ZOO at Airports. It’s simply Travel Zoo!! Knowledge is potential power. Saving thousands on a trip is true power, ACTION!! Thanks Zoo!!!!! | I’ve been on many Travelzoo trips. They are always high quality, low, cost, and safe. I wait every Wednesday for my next update on the deals. Thanks for being such a great resource. DLW. | There’s never anything that lives out from my airport, so it’s pointless for me | Without landscape support, this app is useless to me. That’s sad, because I love Travelzoo! | The deals on this site and the customer service is great. Never less than par. | love the things to do and activities in my state of california | Booked several vacations thru Travelzoo.com and have never been disappointed! | I love receiving my weekly notification about travel deals. I enjoy traveling & getting good deals. Travelzoo provides me with what I need on a variety of travel destinations! | Always on top of the best deals offered.  Thanks | Been using the site a while Did Phl Argentina $600 plus tax 6 nites thru marnella

Plenty offers at everyone’s price | Very few offers with longer stays | Best prices you can find and simple to navigate through app | Won’t let me book. Keyboard gets stuck. | My wife got a great deal on a hotel in Asheville with all her tippler fruends. | Did a ski trip through Travelzoo and the place was great
Place awesome
Looking forward to more trips | Prefer the website. The App is too crowded and stuff not accurate. Kimpton deal in LA continues to cram back in the amenities fees that supposed to be waived. Tapping another path took me to Google and other suggested logins. Then it cannot because Google doesn’t it considered secure. App and paths would benefit from much better testing. No clean way get in app help or questions things. Just a slightly over engineered app that needs some additional testing. Back to web. | I have used Travelzoo for over ten years and it is always my first app to search for travel deals. Ten years ago my husband and I celebrated our 25th anniversary and had blocked out 3 weeks in May for the trip. I scoured Travelzoo for months and was able to grab an incredible trip to Australia with flights included from U.S. and 2 flights in country plus 12 nights of great hotels the first week of May. My husband was nervous about not booking earlier but I knew that Travelzoo would come through! Have booked many great spa days in Chicago and excellent dinners on the App. Never been disappointed by the quality of the experience or the value that Travelzoo offered. Planning a 35th anniversary trip this May and know that Travelzoo will come up with an amazing trip deal for us. | Love Travel Zoo!! Never have been let down!! | I have been using travel zoo for years! I tell everyone about it!! We have traveled to places like London, a 3 week tour in Vietnam, hotels & spa packages in Vail, Colorado and a Caribbean cruise to name a few. All our trips were Amazing and great deals! 
I look forward to the top 20 deals coming out every Wednesday!! | What a dump. Shame on you Travelzoo for promoting this dump. Shower did not have hot water, nor did it drain properly, room heater was loose and never heated the room warm enough even though thermostat was on hottest setting- 85 degrees. Bathroom sink was hot and cold were reversed. Bathroom was incredibly cramped. For Travelzoo to promote this, I now don’t trust your website. | Highly recommend it app if traveling at a discount is your goal. | I’m a long time user of Travelzoo. I enjoy the easy to navigate app. Chootie88 | I’ve been checking TravelZoo for several years for travel bargains. Many, many people I know ask where I get my info and good travel deals. 
I always say Sign up for TravelZoo. It’s the best resource for reasonable and good travel locations. | Travelzoo has allowed my husband and my self to travel 2 times a year due to lower prices 😁.

We have been using travelzoo for over 15 years, at least twice a year! I can hardly wait till the new trips come out on Wednesdays! Great way to travel the world for very reasonable prices! | Great app | It's very helpful to find a dream vacation . | I have been using Travel Zoo for a few. Years now. The deals that they offer are fabulous. I have told so many people to check out this wonderful site. We are now retired, but for many years we were a family of five. Sometimes living from paycheck to paycheck. We definitely took advantage of some very affordable vacations. I also just love looking on the site to get ideas, or to just dream! | Cellular data is turned off for Travelzoo | Travel zoo was once a decent app. Now it’s a lot of third-party shenanigans. Not sold on it. I’ll do my own research thanks! | I love travelzoo they always have the best deals at the cheapest prices, no scams no telemarketers just good honest deals for people who love to travel | Because of Travel Zoo I have traveled to places I never thought were possible. | Travelzoo has the best deals the best aventures and the best dreams! | My name Is Jose Rivera from Puerto Rico, Thanks to your reliable and excellent offers I have known many places in the world since I discovered them 4 years ago.!! Thank you travelzoo | Most people love packages that include air. People worry they won’t find a good air rate.  Please show more air-inclusive packages and tours, as you used to do. | I’m happy to be able to access this application to find great deals for travel. We are always satisfied! | I love Travelzoo! So many wonderful travel and food options. Can’t wait to go on my next trip to Costa Rica. | Selected the wrong language and don’t know how to change to English | Since my wife and I found travelzoo we have taken advantage of several trips. We have experience places we never dreamed of at great rates. I look at the top twenty almost every week just to see what might pop up. Never had a bad experience with their deals.

4321 Amelia 4321 4321 | The game was mid but like was intertainig | Nice and relaxing enjoy playing the games | I love this game cuz I get to build my own things and send off the helicopter | It is so fun cause I am a farmer girl and it is so fun | I’m disappointed the photos show an entirely different game then what gets downloaded the game in the photos is the one I wanted I didn’t get that game I got another game that I had played before so I know it’s different then the one in photos I’m getting tired of everytime I find a game I want to try to play I download it just to find out it’s not the same game advertised truly disappointing! | I was busy learning on Duolingo, and a demo ad for this game came up. When I clicked continue at the end of the demo, I downloaded the game and was greeted by not a game where you move around collecting items to sell to customers and manage buildings, but a top down city building sim where you do none of that. Please make your demos actually reflect on the gameplay in your game in the future. | J’aime bien | Thank you Township
You really are the goat 🐐 | This game is great, but right now it is ruining all my work and spending all my money. Please fix this. Also could you please make t-cash easier to earn. Thanks and please fix I love this game! 🫤😐😥😓😭😢🥰😘😍 | These ads are a game that I would actually  enjoy, except that it’s clickbait to a totally different game.  Nothing like what is advertised. | The game is simple, fun, and a bit addictive. It not like the ads that you’ll find for it though. But that’s okay, it’s essentially a “city builder” and a match-3 type game smashed together. I’d give it 5 stars, but the ads really should better reflect the game that you’re downloading. The game also starts to add a lot of extra little features the longer you play.
On top of that, if you have the habit of spending too much money on slot machines and/or other mobile games, you may want to steer clear. The game doesn’t force you into spending money, but it’s definitely entices you to do so. | If you have an issue No real support team available to communicate with, you just chat with AI and no good solutions or results | I saw an ad that got me interested in the game and it’s nothing like that | The videos, photos and ads all show a totally different game. Yes they are both farm games but how it shows the game is played is not actually how you play. Which is disappointing to expect one thing and receive another. 

The game is also time consuming unless you spend real money to make products harvest faster. 

There’s also not many options to earn cash without purchasing cash with real cash. 

I do enjoy playing the game, there are just a few things that cause me not to play as often as I’d like to. | Fun game but gunna spend some real money so no from me. | Some candy crush copycat game levels are so challenging that it takes the fun out of playing. When all available boosters still don’t help pass then it’s less frustrating to just play a different game. The main game takes too long to accomplish anything so it quickly becomes repetitive and boring. 
  The time is also off on several tasks. Factory and construction times take way longer than they should while timed games seem much more accurate. | Nothing like the preview of the game through ads. Game was deleted due to false advertising. | Really nice overall. The timers a bit too long though | I am so pleased of the game! I have been playing for a year!! Once I was talking in the group chat and someone said mean things to people like cursing and I deleted the game for a while because I have a cousin that likes to play the game on my iPad but when he saw them he started to say the words. When I opened the game again I saw no more cursing and that is why I give the game a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ out of five stars | The ad showed much more activities then what you actually do. It was noting at all like the ad and wasted a lot of time in my end. | THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVERRR OMG I PLAY IT EVERY DAY ITS AMAZINGGGG!!!!! LIKE WHOEVER MADE THIS GAME I TRULY LOVE YOU AND. WISH YOU THE BEST IN LIFE 🍓🍓🧘‍♀️💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ | It is so much fun and addicting! | They only show you a mini game in the ads. That you never really get to play | This is a great game ! | I love this | Listen, the game is enjoyable. The variety of things to do in it will keep you signed In for hours but after a while it just seems impossible.  There’s no way crops are taking 5-8 hours and buildings are taking almost 2 days.  I’ve gotten pretty far but I’m losing interest because every time I turn around, something I need won’t be available for hoursssss.  Of course you can buy things to speed up the process but that shouldn’t be a forced option.  Developers should make upgrades available that makes the factories and farms produce faster.  I want to keep playing but the large wait times are making me check on my community less and less. | I’ve been playing this game for a couple weeks and became super addicted. I loved the variety that this game offered and it was a great mental break from my stressful day at work. I also enjoyed the fact that you didn’t need to keep spending money, it takes longer, but still possible. HOWEVER, when I went to open the app yesterday, it would no longer load on my device. Instead, I received a message that my device was no longer supported with the new app release. As a result, I lost EVERYTHING, my progress, my rewards, and right before I was about to earn the 2nd phase of the Camping Event decoration. Really disappointed in this development team for not letting people know that certain device compatibility would no longer be available with the newest app release. If I had known, I would have synced the game to my social account to save it. I also reached out to their support team and have not received a response. | The game is so fun! Nice job creating it. 
                       The only thing I like to do at night. | Love this game but I’m very impatient so building this seems to take a bit long for me. | lol | At first it’s relaxing. You feel like you’re accomplishing some little goals and building your town. Before you know it you have to have ridiculous amounts of numerous items that your barn can’t hold. So then it takes forever to make progress. Not fun anymore. Boo. | Love township! | This game is kinda fun but I like robux betteRRr because thê ADDS area fake and Roblox is Nop a play to win | Its so relaxing and there’s no ads | I love this game it is so good ! I love it so much it is awesome! | Another micro purchase game where after the first few levels, everything you need to continue the game (without waiting days and days to get materials through random chance) must be purchased through real cash. It also is NOTHING like the AD that they posted that made me interested in the game. 

These type of developers are the worst off their kind. I wouldn’t be surprised if these are the same developers for Airport City. Another game you should avoid at all costs - unless you enjoy spending lots of money to play a game on your phone. | Iam having fun with daydreaming about real life was so real | I saw this app in a ad and it is not like the ad at all so just keep in mind that.
Other than that it’s a great game! | The game is not as advertised 
This is like FarmVille but a little bit more boring.
I was hoping for the advertise game where the character walks around collecting stuff then expanding, disappointed | This game can be frustrating! Does anyone else feel like Deja Vu. Like I swear I worked my town and I am doing it all over again while time is running out? Then I never finish my airplane or train because what says it takes 1 hour turns into all day to make.  How can this be right?
The only thing I like is you actually earn dollars I stead of other games where you earn them twice a year.  I do like that, but seriously if I work my town, let it save and if it says 1 hour dont make it run 4..  very frustrated!! | Got based on ad, I have yet to see anything like the ad. Stupid game click bait type company. | This game is really easy and fun | I really like this game but there are a lot of ads and I don’t like when you come back in to the game after a while and gives you so many games to go play it is really annoying after a while | I’m sick of the updates | I wish I could skip or fast-forward the regatta recap each week, it takes too long | The game it self is fine. Like any other farming game but the ad for it is fake, false and not like the game at all. In the beginning the game is fun but once you go on you have to spend actual money or hope you find the things you need for quests or to upgrade houses/farm things it gets to get old real fast. Since they updated it, it's also full of ads. Not worth playing | Building your town is fun | Ok people I have had this game for over a year and so today I had 96$ (aka) township money and so I spent it all on the 200$ grand prize at the mine and guess what just guess what I got nothing because I had 6 more tasks to go and so the reason why I am mad is because you would need around 200$ to get 200$ and so now I have nothing so please do not get this game I used to love it and play every day and I am now at level 40 but now I am going to delete it but for the people that is reading my report, I hope this gives you an idea of what this game is and so thank you for your time.

Nothing great!  But you better not lose your account credentials.  The forgot ID and forgot passwords links never work.  You never receive a response from the host to reset.  If you lose your credentials you will have to setup a new account with a new email. | Please bring back flight times on main page of flight information. It’s annoying to have to click to know when the flight leaves as some people may also want to consider that when booking…not just price and travel time | I am unable to add my flights to my calendar from the app unless I give the app full access to my calendar.  Delta does not need to know when my next dental cleaning appointment is in order to add flights to my IPhone calendar.  So then I looked at the data the app gathers and it’s an abusive data grab.  Health and wellness information is gathered from your phone by the Fly Delta app and is tied to you. The list of data they gather and match to you is extensive but the health data is the best example of what appears to be Delta’s attempt to mine your data because it’s valuable.  In now going yo have to figure out how to delete this app from my phone and still get what I need done when I travel. | The Best | App kicks me offline after airplane mode and will not let me reinstall or open | I have always enjoyed playing Delta and I’ve had very few problems with them. However, they have the worst Internet service of any airline I have ever flown on virtually useless other than getting your email. Sorry that’s the way I feel. | I am currently sitting at my gate (fully checked in and through security), but the app still says that I am unable to check in. Luckily I have paper boarding passes, because the app is unable to show my boarding pass at all.

Additionally, my earlier flight had a gate and seat change that the app did not show, which led to confusion during boarding. | This app and the Delta mobile experience is objectively terrible. I conducted a heuristic evaluation of this app one year ago for UX design school assignment and compared it to JetBlue, Hopper, and Kayak, which offer much better experiences for flight booking and management. Delta is still bottom of the barrel. Mobile web checkin is so problematic and the app isn’t much better. It is basic UI/UX design and engineering. Why can’t you get it right, Delta?? | I checked In online and my boarding pass was stored on the app.  I was first in line to board FIRST CLASS.  
The boarding pass vanished!  People behind me were in a long line to board. 
The app demanded my password and fingerprint ID.  
My password is stored, not memorized so I was not able to log on.  
The desk agent had to print a boarding pass and I was last to board.
This was embarrassing, frustrating and stressful. | Why have an app if it’s so nonfunctional that you still have to do everything through a web browser? | Since the last IOS update, the app doesn’t bother to show flight times when attempting to book a flight. Have to either click on details, or break out the PC. Tried deleting and restoring, powering off the phone, airplane mode…

Trash. | I have had an account with Delta for 3 years. Got kicked out and had to re login. They tell me my information is wrong (it isn’t) and I have to do forget password/username. I do that and never get an email. FRUSTRATING. Haven’t had this problem with United! | Main cabin seat selection merely a game for delta employees to play with passengers. The app has a diagram of a plane with seat which are not selectable and the information not real time and likely made up! I suspect Delta is overbooking their planes. | Kept sending me multiple updates about my seat being chosen and my boarding pass being ready but everytime I went to go confirm my boarding pass it would say there was an error. Totally disliked this app | Delta is my favorite, and preferred, airline carrier, to the point that I work towards status every year. Their app is my least favorite of the major carriers. It is incredibly slow, glitch, and not as functional as its competitors. | Can't even get it to work. I tried contacting customer support to add games but instead they made me book a flight to Dallas, Texas. Now I'm in the middle of nowhere, everyone's looking at me funny because I'm wearing a rainbow shirt, and I can't even play Kirby Tilt 'n Tumble. Waste of time. | The flights are on time by and large, the staffs are great as well as their customer service. You don’t see that in other airlines. | Delta is what the other airlines wish they were. They are competent professionals in their line of work. Consistently knowledgeable and helpful.They always know the mission. The other side of that is what American Airlines provides. When I have to fly American Airlines, it always feels like everything they do was designed, and organized by incompetent toddlers. They do NOT know the mission. It’s not the employees fault, they are people trying to make a living and have not been given the proper training or pay for their positions. I would definitely blame upper level management. DELTA- is the Chic-Fila of the skies- minus the chicken. Thank you for holding up your end of the bargain. | Only allows you to add the outbound flight to your calendar. Add an easy way to add the return flight to my calendar. Your stupid today view doesn’t show arrivals times. It doesn’t show when I’ll arrive at my destination. For some reason using the app makes me phone brightness go way up. When it’s dark this feature is BLINDING! Give me a warning or something. Or in dark mode delay it. YIKeS! Ouch! | Most of the domestic flights have been great to us but when we have international flights more expensive in the front that’s when we have few things can be better but that’s okay. I have to write u and U have to read millions of our reviews and work with us. All
In all is a great service and greater airline. ✈️✈️ | I get that the electronic boarding pass reads easier when the screen is brighter, but I shouldn’t have to be blinded every time I load the app within 24 hours of a flight. It’s bad enough that I don’t open the app on the day of a flight until I absolutely need the boarding pass. | Much easier to manage than before 💯 | I always feel confident when I book. A flight with Delta. Thanks for the consistency and high standards.
Aaron | Would like to give a shout out to Angel who was the flight attendant in first class from SLC to Fresno on Sunday 04-14.    Very personable.  Said each persons name.  Went and got the biscotti cookies from coach when a passenger asked for them.  Got me a couple extra packs of gummies.  Said good bye to all when we left.   Helped put luggage in closets that did not fit.  I could go on and on but just know she was super during a turbulent flight.  

Also the pilots kept us well informed of turbulence and the impact it would have on beverage service so the flight attendants could be buckled in.   Eliminates some of the complaining.   

Great crew making for pleasant flight 👏 | Apparently I’m the only one incompetent of making this app work. But it will not let me login! Then, when I go to reset my password, it won’t let me. I keep clicking submit over and over again and it won’t work. | Thanks to this app, making checking in or any changes to my itinerary possible in a breeze! | Used to be a easy fast app to switch seats, I travel a lot and now it literally takes about 50-60 seconds to load the seat map. Poor experience! Everything else seems fine. | I specifically reserved the two seats with window/aisle.  Why do I now have seats in the center of the plane? | I will avoid Delta’s new flights as much as possible now.  I am a female, 5’3”, weigh 118 and could barely get to the window seat even with no one else seated in my row.  Uncomfortable red-eye flight.  No room for legs even for me.

Also, the flight attendants on my earlier flight were average at best. | I wish there was a section where I could look for last-minute flight and travel deals through the app versus having to go online and look that route. As a loyal customer, I wish this was an opportunity. | App is ridiculously slow to update. Checked 3 times on my connecting airport for the new gate. Every other web operation I did was quick. Not Delta. Caused me a needless walk of a literal mile out of my way. Don’t trust the app. Check the board. 

Also frustrating check in. Why do I have to confirm the info already stored in sky miles MULTIPLE times when I am logged in???

Typical of the overall delta experience of the absolute minimum service possible and where we can, we’ll charge you more for the privilege of the frustration | Att: Customer service Supervisor! 

Please send a message to the supervisor of our AMAZING inflight flight attendant on your international flight! 
We had the absolute best experience as a first time customer on your airline on our international flight from Germany 🇩🇪 back to USA 🇺🇸 Atlanta based flight crew. The crew member Especially “David Diver” & Iris was Extremely helpful ! Completely impressed with this crew member! Wow! Exceeded all expectations! We felt we were given First Class service in coach! We had previously flown on Lufthansa & the food & services were below par your food & services far above the rest! Wonderful experience! Pure joy & loved this crew :) A million times thank you! Please share our comments with Flight attendant David Diver! His caring attitude towards passengers brilliantly demonstrates how important hospitality is! Grateful for everything! 
Thank you:) 
Sincerely, 
Cheri Robell & Bri | Delta never disappoints. Great service. | Over the course of nearly 15 years I’ve brought my business to Delta, buoyed by the perceived rewards and customer service that being a SkyMiles member brings. I recently had to cancel a ticket I had recently purchased, only to be charged 200.00, and lose 20,000 skymiles. And for what? To cancel a flight that was a month away, that creates no actual inconvenience for Delta, the computer age and the internet have made airport booking easier than addition on a calculator. I called hoping to find some reason, some rationale, thinking the thousands and thousands of dollars spent over the years, the years of SkyMiles loyalty would matter. Instead I get the same, familiar script. My mistake of picking the wrong day, for a flight a month away, was going to penalize me $400. Thanks to this, I have no reason whatsoever to opt for Delta in the future. At a time when it’s difficult to make ends meet, and prices seemingly increase daily, how on earth do you justify these kinds of penalties? Shame on you... Joe Holt | Delta change the seats. We had booked out over a month in advance. Claiming that when the aircraft changes the computer switched everybody seats. Even though this was an identical aircraft. So the agent moved us to a more preferable location and that is not the seats we got when we got to the airport. Very disappointed in this policy.also on the flight from the United States to Japan. Service of beverages was minimal at best. I don’t think I would choose to fly Delta again overseas. | Always an excellent flight | App for iPhone:
The info is not updated automatically. I need to kill the app and relaunch to see any updated info such as gate or seat numbers. | I travel most every week and will always choose Delta. I get to where I need to go one time and always fly with the best Delta employees | The application is very slow and not user-friendly. It's difficult to find key data and it doesn't even show the baggage claim number like the United app does. The whole app needs to be sped up and easier to see all of the key information. | Excellent.   Like it very much | Seems to be the easiest and most functionalmkf all the airline apps 🤷‍♂️ | We use Delta Airlines exclusively! I have been flying Delta Airlines from Detroit to Houston mostly! With a Cancer diagnosis and treatments for not only myself but our Daughter. We fly from Detroit Michigan to MD Anderson frequently for treatment and diagnostics. The entire Delta Airlines crew from customer service, to airport staff, and especially the Airplane crew have always gone above and beyond for us. Outstanding job to all! 

Mrs. Avra 
Michigan | Had to repeat often when we thought we were already checked in | For every flight, staff take great care of passenger who needs wheelchair for distances and must check folded scooter and walker. They offer assistance at every step including bringing carryon from wheelchair at plane door to passenger’s seat and making sure airport wheelchair arrives at connections. They make disabled person and companion feel safe and free of worry that things will go wrong. | Super easy and fast. Recommend!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 | Last time I flew Delta I was harassed by a gate agent and I only received $55 voucher which may as well have been nothing. | Dear delta airlines I’m sure there are many people who write reviews expressing there thanks I truly hope so. I do not fly very much and would like to express my personal thanks,  so I’m taking this time to write something nice for someone to feel my genuine appreciation for what you all do for a career.🙂 I’m sure everything will go according to plan an would like to say thanks ahead of time for everyone’s hard work and and attention required in doing so. Dear delta airlines you rock and this is me saying thanks for a great ride and see you again on the  20th for my return trip 🙂 | Easy to use except for getting birthdate. Should be easier to get to | It is very frustrating that you can be confirmed on a flight and seats are available but you can’t select one.  I booked a flight yesterday for a flight today and it wouldn’t allow me to do so and I had to wait 45 minutes in line to get a seat assignment and although comfort showed to be available I couldnt upgrade.  That flight due to weather missed connection and I am starting all over with now having two more flights tomorrow with no seat assignment. It adds undue stress to travelers especially when you can see the available seats.

better.",4.84082,6040428,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/67/d4/35/67d43554-87f9-894a-940e-685a13e30acc/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9e/82/f8/9e82f89a-4e06-cd5e-4630-ec58d2811530/1c4a9c86-5af0-4ff6-90c5-0314d4d4c6d9_Slide_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/47/7f/1d/477f1dd3-bb23-9bde-fe0b-f30eb695b4ec/893a2969-6f8e-4ae9-87ed-35d2346e506b_iPhone_What_U0027s_New_5.5-min.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1b/84/54/1b845416-42c1-bff3-cd54-53cbf9353077/c1cdc377-0201-43da-a094-de4a045dc821_My_Trips_5_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0b/0b/87/0b0b871f-2cab-2d6a-a8b0-df8b57ea92e8/a0acd7e3-f1f3-42a9-a7ea-ff0e30151b54_Slide_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/51/e2/b0/51e2b00e-4829-392c-d20d-ebaf3d750981/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/62/81/9e/62819e7a-6a58-6017-988f-89b2fc32c0bb/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/63/6f/09/636f09f7-adb0-3bbd-a0fc-d6e590d412ee/d4fa9e88-7245-4b11-b6d7-0c30b6587dc9_Slide_9.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7f/07/75/7f0775b8-1df1-1935-f6d6-96293731567a/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/a0/0e/03/a00e0375-8cf3-7aec-daea-09f05819f609/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/eb/ae/ee/ebaeeefb-5180-1412-7a04-e643e22b9fb4/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9a/73/38/9a73388e-9f32-5749-ac3d-ed7a49776c95/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/71/36/01/713601c1-d837-c734-f6ef-3a1595f6ec72/11271511-b89c-4745-9de1-02f338960fa4_iPad_12.9_2nd_Gen-min.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/80/68/b7/8068b7c6-32c1-8d99-7da8-c5864ea3dcb8/3fd25f77-fad5-4948-b50e-b1b4f41f86d2_My_Trips_12_9_2nd_Gen.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/98/70/db/9870dbaf-422b-2af9-42ed-eb33787707e3/f4c9963c-aed4-428b-b49f-6040ba948137_SkyMiles_12_9_2nd_Gen.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/e0/ab/58/e0ab58c0-3718-446e-01ce-5df4488a2668/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/fb/24/d6/fb24d63a-db40-2549-d080-a058c53d67f6/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/fe/d8/c8/fed8c8e9-238c-7878-615c-4b9d3d0b6b11/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/58/08/35/58083546-8855-745e-8625-1959891551bc/pr_source.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",

You have orders to fill. There are various ways to produce the order requirements, including automatic producers. Automatic producers release items, into adjoining cells, every few minutes and don’t require energy. The only thing is some of the producers used earlier in the game, are never used again. So they just sit on your board or take up space in your limited storage. I would have given a higher rating but the Daily Challenge is impossible to complete if you’re employed or have a life. | I like this game, I just wish they would bring back the delete button for the bubbles, it’s annoying that they’re just floating around taking up space. | I quite enjoy this app and spend hours at a time | i was really excited i played it for a few days to complete and offer and i reached over $140 to cash out and now it tells me i have to get 15 clicks in a referral link, invite 6 friends, complete 6 games, and now get up to $220. | Absolutely love this game | The amount of clicks doesn’t match the number of energy decrease. Please fix | Ok so I love this game and don’t mind spending more here or there to buy diamond to keep playing 
However, the first 2 purchases were ok but my last 2 they keep charging incorrect price for things. I just bought a 80 pack of diamonds which is 1.99$ and they charged $6.49 which is absurd. And the previous time before this I bought the 5.99 pack and they charged me $10.82!!!! Very disappointing and such a scam, I will absolutely not spend a dime more on this game. | My game will load to 97% and then it will stop loading. I’ve reinstalled it restarted and restarted my device and it still will not load. | The tutorial was making me tap the bucket to add it to my board but my board is full but bc the tutorial was making me doing a specific task it won’t let me tap anything outside of that bucket. This is horrible pls normalize a skip tutorial button on every game 👎🏻 | It’s a really fun game but getting energy takes so long. You have the option to purchase diamonds and energy, which I don’t do since the value for your money isn’t good at all. Once you get to higher levels it can take multiple days just to complete half an order. I’ve been trying to get to a sandwich sticker for one half of an order and I’m on day 3 and I’m now finally getting close! That’s with winning energy, completing daily challenges, trading diamonds for energy, and honestly I’m kinda addicted to the game now lol so my energy doesn’t just sit there so I’m using all I get. If I had spent money on packages for energy and diamonds to try to get this sandwich sticker I probably could have bought quite a few real sandwiches by now. Why would it take a minimum of $10-$15 dollars to get enough energy to get half of an order in higher levels!? Yall think we’re millionaires don’t yall! | It’s unplayable without spending money for more energy. | I like this game, it’s entertaining.. but the daily challenges are ridiculous.. what do you mean I have to make 15.5k coins a day? It’s impossible considering you can only receive 4 orders at once and there’s no “reward boost” in some sense.. I think you should reduce the challenges goals for the players to be able to complete most of them. | Very Fun and satisfying game | Yet another, it’s fun at the beginning but now you need to spend money in order to have energy to continue, or wait 5-6 hours to play again. Don’t waste your time. | It’s a good game but when it was full I couldn’t get out of it anymore, is that a bug? | Only bad thing is u can’t stop playing lol! | I love this game!!! | I’ve only just gotten to level 30 and have been playing this game for 3 months. You really can’t  get much done without buying energy because it’s so difficult. | I’ve played this game for about 2 years. It’s a great game, and super fun to play. However, with the recent updates, it looks more like a kids game. The changes in some of the graphics make this game look like it’s for toddlers. It’s made me want to limit my game play, and I would prefer it to look the way it did before. | Used to be a lot of fun. And probably still would be, IF I COULD PLAY IT!! For about the last two months it won’t load. It gets to 36% and that’s it. And I updated it, still won’t load. | One of the better merge games for the simple fact that you just have to merge two things which makes merging flow faster, especially when you have to merge the more complicated stuff. | This is a great game to play. I find myself it’s been an hours on it. I also find myself spending a lot of money on this game in order to achieve and complete some of the tasks that you have, but what I come across is that you don’t get any of the cars that you need to complete decks and it’s very discouraging, especially since I spend a lot of money playing this game. | Stupidly addicting game! I honestly don’t even know why it’s so fun but there’s a certain thrill when you complete a high dollar order! Daily challenges could be easier to hit without spending money and it’d be nice if more than two trades a day. And possibly a way to trade gold cards. | This game is truly designed to make people want to spend money to complete challenges. If this is problematic for you, I suggest to never start playing this game. It’s also designed to motivate you to get on your phone often since certain ‘free producers’ will ‘unlock’ after certain intervals. Even while doing stuff like this I rarely was able to complete daily challenges. This creates a habit of hopping on your phone more throughout the day, and an intentional ‘just a few minutes to use up my free producers’ can turn into a landslide of time if that ends up unlocking energy points for you to use. Time better spent with family and friends. The creators have mastered the art of dangling a carrot from a stick in front of someone. If none of this makes sense. It absolutely will after you’ve played a few weeks. | This game is very flawed and unfinished. It’s as if they spent their entire time on the look of it and only 10% on the actual game itself. 

5 stars for having great fun graphics and being an enjoyable game. But the cons outweigh the pro resulting in the 2 stars.

I feel as if the game’s real objective is for me to spend money. Which to be fair, most games are. BUT this game in particular makes obvious to where you can’t enjoy the game without spending money. When you play you’ll know exactly what I mean. 
The amount of plays & gems they give are unrealistic and if you want to continue to play, you HAVE to spend money because there isn’t any other way to gain more. Similar games at least let us watch ads to get more ! Or gain virtual coins to buy gems. 
Compared to other similar games, this had the best graphics but I deleted it because realistically, you can only play for about 5 minutes because im not spending money on games. & Even if you did, it’s still only another 5 minutes of play time. | I like this game. Reasonably challenging and fun to play. However, you collect card packs to win prizes. The game won’t let you collect all the cards unless you pay. It won’t even let you complete half the packs. It just gives you the same cards over and over. | I love this game, I’ve been playing for years.  There is a BUT, but you will spend money if you want to finish the events. This game has started fights with my spouse because of the amount of money I have spent on this game. And the crazy thing even when I spend the money , I still don’t finish the event.  If they can fix the money trap  it would be great game. But that’s how they make their money . I had  to delete the game to save my marriage. Lol | This game is so cute to play. Honestly you play and just get into such a innocent game you just relax playing it. I use it as a way to just tune out for the few minutes and get me back together lol and go on to the next responsibility I have to do. | The game was fun at first…, but now it has too much going on. It takes way too long to get coins, make builds, and move to the next level—it forces you to buy coins and diamonds to get anywhere. Accessible at first, then definitely aims for you to make purchases! Don’t play!! | The game was very fun and addicting. Now we have to spend a lot of money to achieve a goal. I don’t understand when you need to complete a certain order with the rare items they never come out. It’s starting to seem like a scam. Not enough energy and it doesn’t refill fast. May be deleting soon. | This game was so fun at first... When things didn't take over a million energy's to complete. There's absolutely no way at this point to successfully accomplish anything without spending actual money... Which unfortunately I've done way too many times. It's kind of crappy that when you wait out the time to gain the free energy it only gives you 100 and stops, I feel the higher you get in the game that number should go higher too considering 100 energy's doesn't get you far at all- it's literally gone in 15 seconds. Then you have to wait hours to get it back to 100. There should be more opportunities to watch videos for free items and turns as well. I'm not saying it should be EASY, I just think it wouldn't be so discouraging if it were EASIER.
I've also played the little games to try to win free stuff on the Facebook page everyday and haven't been successful with that either. | I really only see one major flaw with this game being one I play for much longer: trading cards is too difficult. Most of the other games I play with trading between friends makes it easier in that I don’t have to go to a third party (Facebook) to find people looking for cards. 

Collections for friends should be accessible to view and gift from their profiles. I suggest looking at other games which have done this well. 

Also being able to form clubs to have a side quest/game/card request would be great, but not as necessary as the first suggestion.

Thanks for a cute and fun story, with gameplay that is interesting! | I really like this game. It keeps me entertained  the only thing that bothers me is you run out of energy fast. When you’re higher in level you almost have to spend real money to progress  other than that it’s great. | Graphics that weren’t broken were updated to straight cartoon goofiness. Bugs too many to describe have popped up, and now my game won’t even launch all the way. You’ve lost an avid fan. | GOT TOLD I WILL GET 750$ GIFT GARD FOR SHEIN IF I PLAYED TIL LEVEL 14 ITS A LIE DONT DO IT
YALL | If you find a site saying you can get free Pokécoins (pokemons go currency) by playing this game til level 10…. It is a scam. There is no content locker, support leads you in circles. Its a scam. Mediocre matching game. | My board was full and it told me to add another bucket onto it, i cant because the board is full. tried resetting and reinstalling the app but nothing has worked and im still stuck at the pop-up forcing me to add a bucket to the board. (edit): A skip button popped up and it doesn't do anything. | I really enjoyed it. It is very easy to play and you don’t actually have to buy anything to keep progressing. | Compelling game, but it takes too long to load and often shuts down in the middle of play. Frustrating! | I’m going back in a | I have to have my | Great visuals and quality but you can’t play this game for longer than 5 minutes or progress at a decent rate because of the limitations on energy. Actually so frustrating that this is just a cash grab and way to force people to watch ads to do anything in the game. I would be willing to watch ads if it was clear that the game was developed for enjoyment but it clearly is designed for the owners to just give player 2 minutes of play for them to get you to watch 8 ads. Just disappointed that we can’t just have a freaking game anymore. | I can’t stand how we can’t trade gold cards or trade more than 2 cards a day. This is why I’m kind of playing less😞! | The game doesn’t even load all the way up anymore | I downloaded because of the fetch app (I needed to earn points) but now I forgot about the fetch app and just look this game up everyday. | This game is so addicting! I can sit and play it for hours ! | Get ready for endless pop ups to wade through before you even begin game play. Then get ready for endless disappointment as you realize the only way to achieve things requires buying more gems. This game is a money pit and became more annoying than enjoyable before I deleted it. | This game doesn’t allow to trade with other players to send more than 2 sends a day.  There is no special gold cards trades.  So it’s hard to obtain gold cards or trade with other people.  I am about to give up on this game. | Love the energy boosts | Addicted to this

Very intuitive and helpful in unexpected but appreciated ways. | United needs to update their software system to include hyphenated last names!! | I spend more time on the tarmac than in the air whe I fly United.

I’ve flown FBO and air cargo better than this airline.
I have 186 million views of my reviews on Google .
Hope they enjoy what I will be writing while I am trapped at this hellscape of an airport! | I have never been on a United flight that hasn't been enjoyable. The staff is courteous, kind and super attentive. I travel with my 23 year old daughter with Downs Syndrome and I can't say enough about the genuine concern that United employees have shown her. Thank you so much for making a travel experience that can be stressful so worry free. | Very efficient. Easy to use. | Go do I purchase a seat for $129 and it changes when I get to the airport | United explorer holder disappointed about seating row 47 | Very boring and very unhelpful user interface | Been trying for three hours to check in and your impossible app keeps me going around and never finishes the process.  I’ve scanned my passport 10 times and keeps sending me back to the first screen | My family will NEVER be doing this again!!   So yes I fly to economy.  Yes a lot of airlines charge for a checked bag, but NOT for a CARRY ON!  They won’t even let you download your boarding pass to your phone unless you have paid for a carry-on or checked bag because all they allow you to bring a purse.  Who travels with just a purse??? unless you’re going and coming home the same day which is highly unlikely if you’re flying over a five hour period.  I had to play a feed to make sure I didn’t have a middle seat going there or coming home and could not pay them in one fee and then had to pay $40 in two separate transactions equaling $80 to check a bag. If I wanted to carry on my bag, it would be $99. so my flight ended up being about $200 more than the price listed. if I knew this was the case I would’ve paid an extra hundred dollars to fly with an airline who takes care of all their passengers and I am simply able to download to my phone a boarding pass, let alone not have to pay for a carry-on. so I had to give them my credit card number not once not twice but the six different times and this was over the phone. needless to say, I will not be going through this headache again the agent I spoke with name was ICE she of course, said she understood all this and agreed on most of it. | As a 150+ day per year traveler, I need to be able to change my reservations more frequently than I care to think about. United new app with some of the terminal specific updates is really helpful when I need to squeeze 26 hours in a day. | United knocked it out of the park with their app. It’s easy to navigate, easy to use, doesn’t have overly complicated security access, and have every possible link and tidbit of information a traveler might need. | The flight was delayed from ATL but was able to arrive in Denver on time. The flight had no gate ready and sat on the ramp for 40 min. Causing us to miss or connection. | I have to wait a long time to check in, navigate the pages, etc. a good 20 seconds or more. | Changing the UI to hide flight credits and make people manually enter information the app already has available/used to autodisplay is…a choice. | My check-In process was excellent.  My passport was successfully scanned and documents approved within minutes. | Please indicate in the app to people using a ride share service that drop off is on the fifth level. I had one of your premiere members scream at me over level six rather than level five. | App was draining my battery despite disabling cellular/background refresh. App was NOT in use for travel related activities. Deleted app and battery drain/use is back to normal. | UA51 on 4/22 Flight was delayed for 4hrs causing our following train connection arrangement and travel inconveniences. | Boarding passes should be listed on the Home Screen for each flight. Trying to find them is a nightmare. | I have been on a few flights since getting this app and it has not added my mileage since the first flight.  
Also, I went to look for a receipt for baggage and it is telling me the 1st bag was free each way, so I cannot get a receipt whatsoever. 

I am very disappointed as I may have to pay back my company for the baggage, and I should have many more miles than what is shown.

Very poor coding on this app. | UA has the best airline app of all airlines for employees flying non-Rev!  It is the easiest to navigate and link your mileage number.  It is also the most dependable! | Normally the app is great. I rely on it for everything I need and it anticipates what I need. My only suggestion would be to not move around the things that we might look for like baggage tracking. However I think I hit a bad bug this morning. 

I had a flight yesterday and checked in via the app. That flight went as expected. I also had a flight today and checked in yesterday before I had completed the trip I was already on.   This morning, I went to check the status of today’s flight and it (and two more future flights) were missing. I was able to log in on the web site to get my information and add it back to the app but my confidence in the app has been shook. 

I tried restarting the app several times but have not tried rebooting my phone yet or uninstalling/reinstalling the app. My iOS is up to date. | Excellent flight and excellent experience over 40 years of flying with United.
Thank you so much! I’m so impressed! | my app has stopped opening on my macbook even after the updates | App won’t let me edit spelling of my name. Can’t speak to a human for assistance. I spelling h discrepancy causes delays at airport | All day I was not able to check into my flight. For a major airline to be down all day is 3rd world. From a million miler. | Shame as it was a descent app but developers appear to have dropped support for iPhone 8+ which is limited to iOS 16.7.7. Trying to keep older phones out of landfills. Be nice is they still supported older iOS like all other developers. | United treated my luggage very poorly.  Worse I’ve ever seen.  Damaged my luggage.  The flight to Destination had no tv nor any internet.  Very bad experience. | The on line version and iPhone app both make make it very difficult to get a mobile boarding pass. | Are all United app updates mission critical to patch flaws or new must have features?  Probably not.  But we are forced to update almost every week before we can “use” the app to book a flight.  Imagine you need to have new tires or seat belts or an oil change every time you drive your car.  If they can’t get it right the first dozen times there is clearly something broken like your BA planes! | I felt like the airlines has deceptive practices. There are many underlying fees and everything is extra. I had to check a bag and pay for it. I brought a carrying so I won’t have to check a bag but apparently the r only ticket I bought requires any carry on be checked. | Stopped working a while ago. Tried reinstalling, updating iOS, but nothing works. Been like this for several versions of the app already | It would be nice if you could select checked bags and select “military on orders” without having to pay $40, since it shows bags should be free. | I’m traveling with my elderly parents and my father who was just diagnosed with Parkinson’s. I called to ask if we would need to check in our carry on since they were basic economy. We do not want to check in luggage. Rachel was so wonderful in getting my parents closer to the front of the plane. And helped me understand we do not need to check anything in and are each allowed a carry on and a personal. It’s so nice to be able to call and speak to a human and get such wonderful service. My family and I love United Airlines and we don’t fly any other airline!!! You’ve always taken great care of us and we thank you for that!! Keep doing what you do and give Rachel an award!! We give her 10 out of 10 for her communication and patience!!! 
Thank you! | Worst app, user unfriendly. United needs to look at American Airlines app. AA app has lots of info, you can share your trip, and doesn’t keep asking the same questions. Do better United. | I went to check in for my flight and discovered I was not allowed a carry on bag. This was NOT mentioned while I was booking the flight. You need some transparency a little earlier on. It took me all morning on the chat to find out that even my mileage plus account was meaningless. Do better United. | This app is garbage. No synchronization across the app. Clunky interface. Slow. Doesn’t provide notifications for flight updates.

All the info is there is an aesthetic, condensed view.

However, I would say 9/10 times, when I open the app, it is the laggiest app ever and crashes my entire phone. This is the reason why I’ve tried nearly every other weather app. But all the others are missing some piece of information, where this one has it all. 

Not sure if it’s because I have an older iPhone (SE first Gen) so it can’t handle the app, or what it is, but I keep putting up with it because this is the only app with all the info I want. | No portrait mode on the newest version, the layout is also terrible. Uninstalled already!! Hate it now as most longtime fans! Won’t install back until the iPad version feature the portrait mode | settings are worthless.  I pay a premium price to be notified of stupid weather that is supposed to be “OFF” ?!?!  How dumb am I !?!?  My notification settings are presently set for weather related warnings in my area ONLY !  Instead, I get onscreen prompts to look at weather channel reporting I could give 2 shts about.  I am positive this is intentional on the part of the weather channel because if it wasn’t for those who paid to have this app, none of these shtass stories would be seen by anyone. !!  And yes I have reviewed my notification settings !! | I do not like the new look. The radar screen takes 80% of the space. Looking for another app | Poorly designed app with conflicting colors, small fonts which leads to eye strain. Info is scattered thru out the app. There is no watch app. Subscription has been canceled. | Weather alerts are useful, but the gloom and doom junk science alerts that get delivered multiple times each day have become pathetic and are pure rubbish. | Unreliable does not even load in time to look at the weather and is very much inaccurate. Will tell you 0% chance of rain when other apps say 30 or 50%. | I am so tired of The Weather Channel pushing climate change in their stories. Please stick to reporting the weather and not push an agenda. | I want to first start off by saying the weather channel widget is arguably the best in its class as far as weather goes.  Being able to glance at my phone to see if rain or snow is on the way is really nice, however…with this new display that was released you can barely see the rain on the daily/hourly forecast and I keep mistaking the sun displayed as lightning, please fix this. | The app is horribly riddled with ads to try and force you to pay for premium. You can’t even look at anything at all without ads constantly popping up. | Simply unusable. Confusing interface. Hire new designers please. | The base layout of the screen, which I haven't discovered a way to modify, is absurd. Radar takes up roughly 2/3 of the screen, with the information you're most likely wanting to peruse squeezed into the remaining 1/3. Accuweather is much better in this respect (and many others, for that matter.) | App won’t even open on latest version for iPhone.  Is been sporadic for over a year, but now won’t open at all | On days where a weather event is showing in my zip code, can you suppress the ads (like Temu, etc.) that take time to load and may cause a delay in getting emergency data in a timely fashion? For those of us that depend on your tool and live in areas affected by tornados, seconds matter. | I love the Weather App.
It has all
The weather, interesting quick to read articles and lots of other information!  
Thanks! | Why do you block the UI thread when opening the app to update the data? It makes me want to throw my phone through the wall. Do it in a background thread and show the user a progress bar on an indefinite loading spinner. Anything other than freezing the UI to refresh data! | The update is only in landscape? The radar map takes up 2/3 of the screen. Full screen pop up ads. Small font. Clumsy navigation in the smaller 1/3 of the screen. Time to find another weather app. | I have had The Weather Channel app since it first came out. I used to love this app. Loved it. Now, you have updated the interface, and that really is horrendous!! I am a Premium member that pays you money. Have an option to revert back or change the interface the way it was, because the new one is long on a design that is the worst possible choice you could have made. The old interface was really nearly perfect. Why mess with something that just pisses off your member, like me? I will not renew your subscription, and I’ll find another app that has an interface that I can stomach. Yours is so horrendous, I should give you negative 5 stars. That’s - 5. | It makes me aware of what I should wear | April 24, 2024…what in the name of common sense have to done to the weather channel app? I open it up on my iPad to find I have to give you all this personal information just to watch the last eat news videos. And even when I “think” I’ve done it…NOPE the videos won’t play.  This is the absolute WORST “update to an app I have ever seen.  I absolutely hate this app now. Have enjoyed just watching the news updates while eating my breakfast.  Well thank you for ruining that.  Why can’t you people just leave well enough alone?! Huh? Just leave things alone. I hate this app now.  Maybe I can just watch them on my phone…but I’m sure you’ll find a way to ruin that as well. | The widget I use from the app changed its font to something way smaller. The app doesn’t load as fast as it used to. Why the changes? It made it worse | The weather app is my daily planner! Thanks !It is a great comfort to be able to plan your day because the Weather Channel influences your mood for the day 
. | Great | This app is loaded with unnecessary features that slows it down. It takes forever to load and you constantly see ads. Terrible | What happened to portrait? I used this app for years, but I could not turn it from landscape, so I looked for another app. Bye now | I hate the new layout. Quit changing things just for the sake of chang! | I liked the app before it was updated.  I find it much harder to read now…both daily and hourly are way too weird to read! | Please delete the last update. This app Went from amazing to horrible in one day. New update is terrible, can’t even see daily night-day weather without selecting through individually. Checking weather for 5 days takes 5 minutes instead of 30 seconds before the last update.  Look at weather bug, Literally one click and you can see the 10 day for both daytime and night.  Weather channel now takes 30 clicks to see the same info, that’s horrible. | As is typical for app updates, this one has made the Weather app worse. In my case, I can’t even open it. I’ve had the app for years, but it won’t let me log in. When tried to reset password, I never received an email needed to reset. Time to find a new app foe weather forecasts | The new design is awful | Still doesn’t show places you try to save. Incredibly annoying as the older version worked fine for this. | Locations I have saved won’t load. When I tried to add them, says already added. Need to fix the bugs. New look is ok. | Reeeelllllyyyy accurate weather | This update is terrible. So difficult to use. If you simply want to quickly get your forecast, good luck. You have to weed through. Used to have it all there at a glance. Now it’s all spread out unnecessarily. Too bight needs a dark mode. Font is far too thin and difficult to see. Notifications average over 12 a day when all I’m experiencing is clouds and my notifications are set to local only. I’m a premium subscriber and I will not be renewing. Look to the Clime app if you’d like to see a functional “weather” app. This one is garbage. Then they went ahead and ruined the iPad app and stuck it in landscape only mode. Did you not test market this poor decisions. So disappointed | Slow to load. Notification excessive. But good layout. 

This app needs work. | This app went from being great to being horrible in a matter of six months. And I’m sure it is so you will pay for that properly works. Horrible,horrible app! | The best weather app but I would prefer WeatherBug and fox weather but  I use 3 weather apps but this has to be the best weather channel to use it tells you when there’s a severe weather alert like severe thunderstorms and tornadoes and when there lightning | Very accurate | This used to be a great app but not after this update. DELETE! | I used to love this app until they updated it. It doesn’t update the correct time of day and is so much harder to navigate. I use my iPhone’s app now for the weather. There’s also a bunch of ads I get now. | This new update is a mess. Stuck on the sign up pages and all my widgets are broke.  Uninstalled and reinstalled and still not working. | Suddenly this app only displays in landscape mode, so I stopped using it.  This app was once my favorite% | Before I posted this review, I scrolled down through the other, more recent reviews. And review after review, without exception, they are one or two stars. I’d give this ZERO STARS if I could. It is absolutely NOT helpful, OR accurate beyond 1-2 hours. And even at that - you’re pretty much on your own. I DO find it very interesting that regardless of all the mostly 1, maybe 2 star reviews, your app average continues to hover around 4.7. So either y’all are paying Apple off, or they let you “grow your own” with the averages. It is utterly amazing to me that people would PAY for your crappy app. Now, it USED to be pretty good. But anymore? Oh HECK no - no way would I pay for this garbage. | Now you can’t even read the alerts till 20 min later. Nothing works. And it’s 95% WRONG | The new version is one of the worst apps I have.  On the hourly forecast, the times are all wrong, there’s no times past 11am. It goes 11am then 12am, which is incorrect. Furthermore, the layout is bad, nothing flows. It seems like they just wanted to put as many ads as possible everywhere and really screwed up the app. I used to rely on this app daily for years. I’m so disappointed. I wish TWC would bring back the old version. | I’ve generally enjoyed this app (as a premium subscriber) for years. I find it’s better than the native iPhone weather app with more detailed forecasts, radar, and alerts. And the recent redesign is really great. However, a MAJOR flaw is that it doesn’t respect audio settings. My phone can be muted, or the volume at the lowest setting, and anything with audio in this app comes on at full blast. This is especially annoying when I accidentally tap a video. Imagine being in a meeting at work, trying to quickly assess if I’ll need an umbrella on my commute home, and then my phone starts blaring a video (often with background music) at full blast. Fix this, and it’s a five star app. | I’m a Premium subscriber. This used to be my ‘go to’ app for checking the weather, but I probably won’t be renewing my subscription. The new, updated app has too much filler and not enough actual weather reporting. The weather video clips used to have a great team of knowledgeable, friendly meteorologists. They are gone now, replaced with much less informative videos with text box overlays and loud music. Overall, the new version of the app is visually more cluttered, with a lot of filler content. I’m guessing these changes were done to cut costs, but unfortunately what was cut is what made this a great app. | New format is awful. | Since updating the app on 4/23/24, none of the locations I saved show up anywhere. I have to search for every location I want to see instead of being able to choose from my saved locations. There is also not a single day overview like there was before. The only option is hourly or weekly. I liked the single day overview as that gave me an overall view of what to expect without having to read descriptions or go through hour by hour.

Back in the car and back home. Works great for my life style. | Awesome | Life is hard enough without the lives we stand in!!! Scan-n-Go eliminates one of them! | This still hasn’t been fixed after adding items to scan and go you can’t check out because the checkout button doesn’t work. Not sure if it’s because the phone gets locked, not keeping the phone open the whole time, but have to force close the app and reopen it to check out. Already deleted and reinstalled same thing. | I love my Sam’s in Bossier City.  The only complaint I have is, there is no manual wheelchairs in the store. Only motorized ones.  I have a special needs daughter that can’t walk very far.  The last wheelchair that was there, was so worn out, it wasn’t safe.
I would love to see some new ones in the store.

Thank you,
Deborah Garrison | We enjoy the value @ Sam’s Club on things we use frequently.  Bathroom tissue, paper towels, laundry detergent. | Please I beg you please don’t ever stop this self checkout app. It’s every. Keep making it better.  Now that you all decided to employee less employees (ridiculous) the checkout lanes are out the door. Just horrible and those self checkout machines are a joke! | I went to Sam’s Club in Winston Salem on Summit Boulevard yesterday to look at the 6’ x 4’ garden shed. A really helpful employee wearing a Vietnam veteran hat showed me the one that was put together that was outside and walked me through the process of purchasing the shed.

He was extremely polite, helpful, and I appreciate his help. It was just what I needed. | I love being able to order items I need when I need them. | Once you put in a credit card, the app does not let you delete it. | Awesome checkout system thank you so much. Blessings everyone you already have.🌹💕🌹👑 | Had a hard time getting items to load in store | We have ordered everything from an air compressor to coffee, soap and various household items and have never been disappointed. Deliveries have been as scheduled and often before the original delivery date. | What does Sam's Club, a shopping site need with my health and fitness information or my search history? If you use this you are giving them permission to take absolutely everything off your phone including private contact data! People, wake up and start looking at the privacy is for these apps. It's right here on this page! The only way for them to stop stealing our data is for us to stand up and stop using their freaking apps! I don't care if it makes your life easier. You are making it harder for everyone else to stand up. Stand up and say no! Your convenience is not worth the entire user bases data. Every person who uses this app is being incredibly selfish. And you should check your other apps also. | Every time you place an order, you have to add a pick up person when I constantly use the same person they constantly make you put in your four digit code on your credit card. You’re the only company that does that. | I am very upset that I signed up for a Plus membership to get free shipping only to find out the item that’s only available to ship is not free shipping!!!
If you don’t offer free shipping you should at least have it available in store for pickup. 
Karma Probiotic Lemonade Varirty Pak. | I can’t believe how long it’s taking you to finish your reconstruction in this store | Love this app makes it easy for shopping and I get great prices that Sam’s Club | I like the app but do not like that I can’t search past receipts all at once… they are broken into 3 categories and online online orders can be searched. Very inconvenient and I don’t recall if I picked up or bought an item in store when it’s been a minute since the purchase. | I simply order my Starbucks coffee beans online at SAMS CLUB and order shows up at my front foor in a few days. Cheaper on any online store incl A. Once it arrives, I grind a weeks worth of delicious coffee in my blender and Tadah delicious coffee every morning with $100ss savings drinking starbucks at home. Thanks SAMS CLUB : ) | We live over two my hours from the nearest Sam’s out in the country so the shipping option is such a blessing!  I wish the refrigerator, freezer items were available as well since delivery service is provided by FedEx . | Great prices ! We’ve recently switched from Costco to Sam’s club because the prices are soo much cheaper. | Kudos to application development team, who worked on this app development. Easy to use and perfect design. | Great job | Very easy to find things and so convenient. | Great service at Sams on Serene in Las Vegas | This is the way to go when there long lines you get in and out very quickly and easily | .. | I am in utter amazement at the customer service I experienced today at Sam’s off of 635 & Midway!! I was trying to pick out a Hibiscus plant but couldn’t seem to find the perfect one! Yolanda saw me struggling, dropped everything she was doing and went through almost every hibiscus until we found the right one! She had so much patience and grace when I finally got in the car tears just rolled down my face!! Her kindness is beyond amazing I hope she gets to see this review so she knows how much of an impact she had on me! Thank you Yolanda! Hope to see you at my next visit! ♥️ | Love using the QR code | Best app ever invented! | Great products and fast shipping! | Love The Vibrant Colors. . . Love The Performance Shorts That Are Built In. Haven’t Received It As Yet, But All Of Members Mark Clothes Are Phenomenal | Easy and quick | When I go to my cart, 5 items that qualified for free shipping, changed to pickup.
I removed and ordered again.  Three times!!!!

We will not be renewing our plus member in July | I have been suing drive up shopping since before Covid. I was stoked when Sam’s club started it. I’m picky about my stuff, however I have not an issue yet with what is put in my cart. | No wait! No lines! In and out! | Shopping done in minutes!! | Please bring back the churros!!!! | Scan and go is the best part of the app. It’s the only reason we use the app. Easy check out and not have to wait in a check out line is the best! | She was great showing me how to order from the app. Thank you. 
Also I want to recognize the young girl that register me and the guy supervisor too for the amazing customer service. | That girl is amazing Angelina I see her running back and forth and she has amazing customer service I seen in who knows she is amazing | Inventories of items that would keep ny membership alive are not available among many others:

1. Fiji Water
2. Leaf Unsweetened Iced Tea
3. Dishwasher Rinse Aid

Not worth the plus membership fee I paid!

Sincerely,

Hector | Easy to order love Sam’s club | The app works well and is very useful when I am on a schedule and don’t have time to go to the store | Love the ease of using the app when shopping in store and checking out and skipping the lines.  Super easy to use | Love the scan n go !!!! | Easy to use!! | Getting what you need and checking out in a busy Sam's club is easy now! Scan everything you are getting on your phone, and you get to walk right out skipping the line!

Using app sometimes redirects you to online site and makes you login again. Why?  Should be able to see and do everything in the app and not have to login more than once. | The there are 4 rides that we would like to ride but it’s temporarily closed. We were in line for 2 hours when Radiator Spring Race broke down. We asked for some compensation or fast past the attendant are so flat affect, not apologetic, less affectionate | Basically a fast pass downgrade you have to pay $30 for. The mouse needs more money apparently. | Cannot figure out how to link tickets into the app, and cannot find instructions for doing so. Also need to share account password with travel agent and others to link tickets with them. How secure is that? My Disney experience thus far has been disappointing even before visiting the park. | My grandson broke his leg yesterday. He is in a full leg cast and a wheelchair. I called disability services phone number. It’s no longer use. I emailed Disney disability services, they sent me the same phone number.  We are going in two weeks and I need to know what I can do under the circumstances. | The wait times posted are inaccurate! Add 30 minutes to reflect actual wait times. | I had the app before and it worked just fine. I have downloaded it again and now I can’t upload tickets, see the map, order food or try to chat. Help I want to use the app but for some reason it just spins or wont open any pages 😢 | It is so so so so great and totally helped me on my Disney journey!

THANK U GUYS SO SO SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY DAY UNFORGETTABLE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ | This place is amazing and magical. | So confusing. Intro video on how it all works would be ideal. 

Issues linking tickets, had to go customer service

Map could be more user friendly. Better naming , color coding, division of lands etc. 

The whole genie thing is confusing. | The ride I wanted changed from 10 min to 20 min | Can’t reset my password. Says it’s down. | Every time I’ve tried to buy tickets through the app , after selecting my date, which park, adding the geenie pass- once it gives me my total and I press continue, it always takes me to a blank page with just the word “Disneyland”. Super irritating, it does this every time. | my visit to Disneyland, Ca was 5-years, now 2024 will be my 1st time using Disney App. Very helpful, step by step, to order online food, including wait time for rides, That is only the beginning. Keep up the good work 💯👍 | We came to Disneyland again this year to celebrate my wife’s birthday at the Star Wars After Dark party and from the moment we walked in every cast member has made us feel special. Even Vincent who was cleaning the entry restrooms was engaging and friendly! Thank you Disneyland for all the joy you provide!🙏🏻 | Love!!!!!! | The payment I made on my Disney card was taken before I could finish my total purchase and then my screen went blank and when I started over it was gone! | Spoke with Marcie and she is an excellent example of what customer service is. She guided me and answered my questions and I really appreciated that. Thank you!! | Trying to get tickets and get the system error issue, now I have to check to see if I’m double charged. Why can’t this just be easy! | The one time code was never sent though I tried t dozen times | Where a kid can be a kid Chucky | The Disney app and the process of purchasing tickets and the so-called “park reservation” is so ridiculously confusing and frustrating. I’ve been on the app for two hours, and going in circles. The selections are contradictory and take you all over the place then back to square one. This is in addition to the unending paragraphs of parameters to read about, and how your admission into the park isn’t guaranteed, EVEN if you’ve done everything correctly. Huh?? The only feature that actually functions efficiently is the credit card payment process. Gee…. | I have the most fun magical enchanting time with my family | It is confusing how to navigate the site. Maybe say tickets for pass holders. | Haven’t been to Disney property in over 20 years. Purchased 4-day park hopper for specific dates and when we arrived with no reservation found none available for the four specific dates I purchased tickets to visit Disneyland. Not a perfect system. | The App works really well if you are in the park, the map shows where you are, you can mobile order and show you the wait times of the ride | Our family struggled to use the App die to the font soze being too small and unable to increase the soze. | Curating your Disney trip itinerary is just a few clicks away. Seamlessly streamlines all things related to your upcoming trip. Holds on to passes or tickets. Reservations are a snap! Virtually assists in mapping out day to max your time in the park. Can’t decide where to start? No prob. Genie can help with that! ✨ In park, need to make game time decisions? Ride times are at your fingertips. The hard part might be getting your party to agree ;)  Order ahead makes dining a breeze. The chat feature is great and response time quick. Making magic happen! ✨🏰✨ | This app is very helpful and time saving, I believe we get more for our money by being able to plan our day at the the happiest place in the world. Thank for the best memories with our families 😊👍 | New updated feature when you look at the map repositions the screen everytime you click a ride. It was much better when it stayed still as you already had it.  Now I have to move the screen every time I want to look at rides in the same area.  Not to mention it makes my eyes go crazy to see all the movement.  Please put it back to normal. | The App said 25 minutes when we first got here. It’s been 85 minutes and we’re still in line. We want to leave but also hate to give up on all the time we have invested. Would have been nice if the app was actually factual. Disappointing from Disney. | This whole app system is a nightmare. I was forced to spend my entire day in Disneyland, staring at my cell phone instead of enjoying my beautiful time here.
I was also forced to purchase a rechargeable battery because I was forced to use my cell phone for everything. 
Did Genie program is only valid for each individual person so everybody in the family has to purchase the Genie app additional $30 I did not know Disneyland was so hard up on making money .
I will definitely look into other options before coming back here again it literally feels like I’m spending my whole day on a wireless office working an eight hour shift.
Definitely not the happiest place on earth.
Andrea Dixon | Was trying to buy tickets using gift cards. Had to combine them, that was a pain, but did it. Then it wouldn’t accept my card to make the rest of the payment, but sure why. Used another card, it would take them either. Then all the money disappeared from my gift card and had to buy the tickets. They were useless is helping. This place is a joke. It’s an amazing park. This side of it is disgusting | Thank you | I just want to be able to see what events are happening on the day we’ll be there. I was unable to get any information on that. Hard to plan my day around fireworks and parables without knowing what is happening. | Genie pass is a waste of money and inconvenient. It is not valid for most rides and you can only book 1 ride at a time. It blocks bookings for later rides even if they do not conflict with the ride I booked. As a guest I need to spend my time managing your app to determine what is eligible and if I can book it. It created more frustration than the product is worth and is a poor guest experience

(Update: I received a follow up to go into the app and write more detailed feedback. Why bother in the first place then? The above was sufficient. Do you even read these? Why bother sending pro forma responses?) | Amazing, truly life changing | You can’t go to the next screen because the “continue” button is behind the navigation bar and you can’t slide the page up. | So I'm trying to buy tickets. I have a capital one visa. My card denied the first attempt at payment because of security. I had to answer a text from capital one to let them know it was a valid purchase. After that the Disneyland app just kept telling me that the card was no good. The chat advice was useless. I tried changing the billing address, logged out and then back in, did everything they suggested. Finally they told me they could make a reservation for the date we are going so I had to do that. But, I realized that I now won’t have a credit card on my app to use in Disneyland AND I’m going to use the same card to pay at the ticket booth. And they said they can’t guarantee the prices because they are subject to change. If I wasn’t taking a grandchild I’d cancel the whole thing. Walt Disney would be so sad to see what they’ve turned his park into. Oh yeah! I also have 5 pending charges from Disneyland on my card that they said were pending because the merchant had reversed the charges which means the app is dysfunctional. | Fairly accurate wait times. | I have tickets and a hotel reservation and nothing is showing up on the app. It’s like you need a foreign language interpreter to understand Disney speak. Not user friendly! Not friendly for first time visitors. | Waiting lines are too long
Have to buy an additional genie pass. 
Rides are cancelled 
Othe rides closed
We will be return | Magic key holders should be able to view no shows without cast member service and it is impossible to get through over the phone | The app as not as easy or simple to use as it should be. It’s not that intuitive and it’s easy to get lost in the weeds. | Happiest place on ____ | DIFFICULT & NOT WORKING | This is such a great app!

Owner denied a refund, and denied the issues existed. Awful communications and he only responded to my messages when VRBO contacted him first. VRBO customer service did absolutely nothing to help, and the company itself will not watch out for the interest of the renter, only the owner. Furthermore, VRBO allows the owner to charge whatever fees they want. As a single renter, I was charged with an “additional occupant” fee. Although it was successfully refunded, there is no indication the host was reprimanded or corrected. As long as VRBO gets their money, they don’t care what happens to you. | The host communicated very well before and after our arrival and Wi-Fi and TV functioned perfectly. We enjoyed our stay there.
Perfect location for us to explore. The pool & hot tub area is very private, beautiful with a tropical atmosphere. 
🌴👍🌞 | I had originally booked a cabin when My Son decided to come along with us I canceled and was refunded 100% super easy I rebooked a bigger cabin with no hassle at all . I love that they do make it so easy thank God lol!!😄 | Start up on app has been weird and still waiting on confirmation on a time sensitive trip it was difficult to get a login in | Love almost everything everything about the app except that it keeps defaulting to a basic search | I love having the  VRBO app on my phone. It makes planning quick an easy when you want an impromptu getaway. Pull up the app browse locations and select. It's literally that easy!! Headed to a weekend getaway should never be hard.  Thanks Vrbo for getting it right 🥳 Live life and travel because we all work hard, you deserve it. 💕 | Enjoyed our stay. | Maybe it’s me, but the simple search of a specific beach house can’t be done from the app. If it can, I don’t understand how. Shouldn’t be that difficult . | Enjoyed our stay with excellent accommodations. Owner responsive. Right on the beach with excellent conveniences. Unit clean with beautiful balcony view of beach and gulf. We will be back. | Sure won’t let me tie she’s search for the property I know I want. | Recently when I used the app, it wouldn't give me prices for any places. I needed to press ""see listing for more details"", and then it never showed me a price. Now, trying it again after a few weeks, and I can't even find a location if I start typing it in. This app is broken and useless. | Great spacious property. Very generous with towels, toiletries, items in the kitchen that you sometimes forget. We really had a great weekend. 

Katheryn and Mike Paradice | Our family enjoyed the apartment for a week. Management was wonderful. We were within walking distance of the Duomo, Uffizi, and so much of what Florence has to offer. The apartment was quiet, spacious, secure, and easy to bring bags in and out of with the elevator. Bathrooms were great and no water issues at all. It’s a mile from the train station and buses run nearby to get around away from the city center if you like. We would happily stay again. Thanks to Monica for helping when we left something behind! Best wishes! | I set up a new account via the app. No where did it ask me if I am a traveler or property owner. Went to the help tab and it tells me to choose list your property, something that is not there to choose at the top of the page. Very frustrating. | Posted at around $100... final tally $250 and I denied all the extra fees I could!!  Not to mention the extra $1500.00 just in case fee that may or may not get back to me.   YIKES 😱 | The property was excellent for our reunion. We had all moved away from the area and returned to enjoy places that we had enjoyed. Half of the group stayed here and half stayed at another Vrbo. We used both homes and met for meals at favorite restaurants. This home was very comfortable, clean and worked well for us. The pool was quite nice and we had lots of room. | One key is awful and forcing you to sign up for it just to use the app is not okay. Why do I need to sign up for two accounts just to use an app? I uninstalled, too bad because I used to like using VRBO. | Over the past year, this app has gone extremely downhill. Avoid. | They have fixed the app and it works great! Good user interface! | Not only was this house beautiful, but the experience altogether was amazing! We have a family tradition of coming to the ocean every year for the past 5+ years and this has definitely been the best one yet! We really appreciated how the hosts honored your privacy and exceedingly helped all your needs! Amazing hosts!!! The fire wood was stocked for the house, the propane tanks were filled, and they provided everything you could possibly need even chairs for the beach and sand toys for the kids. The view was amazing all around, looked like you were staring at a moving painting all day and the beach was so easy to get to. This year we celebrated our parents 40th anniversary and this house couldn’t have been more perfect! It fit everyone so well and had plenty of space, it was roomy yet cozy and I just can’t get over the view and the amazing hosts! In the past we’ve been to houses that were dirty, or the hosts kept calling every 5 minutes for something as small as leaving a pair of shoes on the outside rug or even catching them walking past the house everyday just to make sure we weren’t throwing parties which made us feel extremely uncomfortable! Our family ranges from our parents (in their 60s) and kids as young as 1 year old all we want to do is to be able to reunite and spend quality time by a campfire while watching an amazing view so the constant stares is definitely a big no from us. This house was very clean, stocked, well organized, and had plenty of toys for the kids. We LOVED that the hosts were just so amazing and nice and just overall the best hosts we have ever had! Would recommend this house to everyone! The experience was really great and the views were beyond words. Thank you for everything!!! | The home was very comfortable, clean and in a charming neighborhood. We especially enjoyed the outdoor seating areas. The hosts were very easy to work with. We would definitely stay here again. | The app doesn’t have a download feature for the reservation to my calendar. I can’t share with others. | We enjoyed our stay. Plenty of room and everything we needed. Great location. Lots of fabulous restaurants nearby. | Although the accommodations were clean and comfortable there were some issues that needed attention:
-no toilet paper in all the bathrooms 
-missing panels in the pool blinds
-dripping water in the shower 
-remote control for ceiling fans inoperable 
-no directions on how to get local channels on TV | Using my app on my iPhone: I’m logged in. Did a search. Want to save a place. It asks me to log in and then freezes up and I have to reset the app. Frustrated | One of the best condos I have stayed in. Everything was close to where we were. The place was spotless. Loves it!! | This is a great application that connects people from all over the world. I’ve rented in multiple countries and many times have always been more than satisfied by the apps ability to connect homeowners with vacationers like myself. | The house is in ideal location quiet but super close to lots of shops and restaurants that you can walk to. House is very clean, beds amazing, outdoor area is beautiful and relaxing   Also inside and outside equipped to cook and entertain in comfort | So far, i thonk the VRBO element of this process is TERRIBLE! 
i spent 25-30 minutes w a heavily accented lady, wasnput on long holds twice andbultimately she was of zero help and finally referred to the ""hosts"" on the site. Attempting to contact them was equally futile. It seems that no questions may be asked and answeredduntil the reservationnis fully complete. This defeats the whole intent of asking questions before booking and had the effect  of forcing me to but trip insurance. 

This is not at all what i would w expect w a national reservation/property management company the size of VRBO. 

We went ahead and booked-- (The property appears to be just what we want) but itcwould sure be noce to talk to a human being before having to lay down $2300

MIKE BRADY 

918) 640- 7350 | Really hard to find my quarterly financial information on app or website version. When I did find it today I couldn’t change the dates to the current quarter.  30 minutes later I still do not have the information I need to run my business and pay my local taxes. Awful experience every time I have to do anything on VRBO. SHOULD JUST REMOVE MY LISTING. | Facility was lovely. Enjoyed the quiet, but convenient location, particularly the sun room and screened in porch. The downstairs bathroom and shower was a bit awkward for two senior citizen couples. Otherwise it was a perfect getaway for us. | We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were in town for business as well as a couple days to relax. Our favorite part was the outdoor area for showers, the tub and just sitting under the porch, enjoying the beautiful flowers and relaxing breeze, and atmosphere.

We would for sure stay again. :-) | VRBO steals your money.  Beware. | We started using other services because the fees are ridiculous! | My college bound son and I stayed in the Mod Pod for the Experience WSU weekend.  It was roomy, nicely furnished and extra clean.  We were also welcomed with a nice personal note and small basket of treats in the kitchen.  The host even offered us homemade fresh baked blueberry scones one morning!  The beds were extremely comfortable with crisp white cotton sheets.  I will definitely look up the Mod Pod again on another trip! | We really enjoyed our time at this cabin. It was our first time with Vrbo so I hoped for a good experience and it fit the bill. I took my time to select a cabin my wife and I both would like. She is picky and she loved it. It was nice and clean as mentioned in several other reviews. She loved the king sized bed, the hotel pillows and the towels too. I liked the view from the large deck and the cozy screened in porch. The hot tub was an added treat. I also liked that it was all on on level without stairs. We hated leaving and surely will return. | Our condo was clean and spacious and centrally located. The people were great to work with and very gracious and generous. We will be keeping their number for future vacations in Branson. | Great house, in one of Destin’s nicest gated neighborhoods. Right on the ocean with breathtaking views from all balcony’s. You’ll get a great stair workout during your daily travels. Ice makers were an added perk, beverage coolers and bars. Just the ultimate chill palace for the week. 
Only complaints, cleaning fee is pretty high, for the level of cleanliness we experienced. Blood clot on the bathroom trim, right by the toilet was an eye sore. Few places with some buildup that needs to be worked on. Smell of mold was very strong. Decorative pillows left on bed and around had some questionable stains, def could use a bath. Also it would be nice if we could fill up the hot tub while we are there, it got pretty low and maybe access to some cleaning chemicals for those families with lil kids who enjoy being in the hot tub. Other then that, wonderful place, loved it! | We just spent a long weekend at Bearadise Condo in Gatlinburg TN.  It was a very peaceful relaxing mini vacation.  The condo is decorated very nicely.  We had everything we needed to fix some meals while we were there.  The view from the balcony was very pretty.  The owner is very friendly and super quick in responding to any questions which was much appreciated.  We would stay again. | I’m used to the way I look and search on VRBO and now I am being switched to the App. I’m sick of people forcing change. Makes me think about searching AirBNB | After reading all these reviews I have to ask why are you people spending time trying to get in touch with these people? Make the attempt absolutely. But that is the only courtesy I owe them. My time is more valuable than theirs- at that point I call my bank and allow them to get my money back for services not rendered. | Cabin was in perfect location, secluded but still close to everything. Cabin was very clean and perfect. Great value for price. Would definitely stay here again. | We had a nice time. Comfortable beds, very nice and well stocked kitchen. The outside patio area with beach view is great.  Best for travelers with a car. Nice pool downstairs. No complaints- recommended. | The website doesn’t have any way to contact regarding security deposit. I left the rental in perfect shape it’s over one week and I still don’t have my $1500.00 deposit back. | The location was perfect, the view was awesome and our host Karen and Mark were very helpful and friendly. Could not ask for a better more quiet place. | It was a great experience. You did an outstanding job on decorations .  You
Had everything we needed. Thanks for sharing your beautiful home with us. | Very comfortable & spacious accommodations. Loved the pool! Very clean. Great host! | Thank you so much for the quick and easy response turnaround time and navigate abilities on your website and app. Bravo. | Our stay at the Island Inn was perfect.  Walking distance to multiple restaurants. Steps to the sand and great ocean views from our room.  Pool was warm on our cooler first days and throughout our entire stay.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  We will be returning to this resort. | Everything was perfect for my stay. It beautiful and close to the beach. It was also quiet and peaceful.

Accuweather is hands down the best. | Not the greatest you vacant change locations  otherwise it’s all right | App has been glitchy since latest update about a month ago.
For instance, Click on daily weather and it displays the days for a few seconds at most then just a blank, blue screen, and it never changes until I go back to Today or radar, etc | After the recent update I frequently see access denied messages on my screen when I try to check the daily weather. I can only see hourly. That’s not helpful | Difficult to use | App has a bug, for most of 2024 so far, that never returns locations in the search. So for local weather app works fine enough. But if you want to see weather somewhere else you need another app. | I’m in Mi, you forecasted clear to PC - it couldn’t be cloudier…0.00 sun.  what the?? | Other app sent out frost warning in time but got one from this app after it had already expired- just not helpful AT ALL. | App uses a massive amount of data. Over 1GB a month. Unacceptable. It’s as if they completely forgot that this is a MOBILE APP where data is limited. | How can I get the radar or refresh with new information? | I need to see the wind mph on hourly and daily. Thank you | As usual you hype everything. | stupid. changing apps. | I trust this app for accuracy. I also enjoy reading the articles. It’s my go-to every am for my local and regional weather. | Access denied codes instead of the usual info. Slow to load. What happened? Please fix this | This App is OK…It wants to be premium, but lacks in many ways. Interestingly, it’s mostly the user interface that is of issue. | I have owned AccuWeather for many years but when I had to update my phone I lost my pro status and was moved down to free version which is less accurate | I’m planning a trip to Europe and when I search for weather in cities there it come up with “no results found” Useless! | This app when always location is enabled will eat your data plan like crazy! It burned my data allowance for the month. There should be a data saver option in the app. I drive for DHL and would travel places daily. Otherwise an overall awesome weather app and I have it installed on my other devices so I still have them. | I try to use this app but it’s constantly buffering with the circling arrow round-and-round. It is Not like it used to be unfortunately. I wish it would work like it used to. | I realize ads are necessary but now they are blocking or partially blocking some of the app information such that it is not totally visible. For instance, the %rain for the week only now shows the top 1/2 of the %.  I am going try to a different app.  I think your page designer would be able to do a better job.  This is irritating as I used this app throughout the day. | So another price increase and nothing new has been added- | And even more difficult in the valley. I have found this app extremely reliable. Have referred to it always. Love that it shows when the percentage of rain may be higher or lower. | Stop with these ridiculous pop up ads it’s so annoying . No one watched them they just sign off then back on to avoid it , your ruining this app and losing viewers !!!! No more ads! | Too expensive. Too many ads. | All pages have error codes saying access denied, please fix this error. | In the Widget can you add what is the HIGH and what is the Low? I see only the temperature , city, state, real feeling | Finally deleting after using it for years. Impossible to search for cities and doesn’t auto update your location. | THE ENTIRE WEATHER TEAM IS GREAT AND THERE PREDICTIONS REGARDING THE WEATHER ARE ALWAYS TO THE POINT AND CORRECT, I WOULD RECOMMEND THE WEATHER CHANNEL TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS BEING WELL INFORMED ABOUT WEATHER PREDICTIONS .
THAT IS AS HONEST THAT I CAN BE. | Imagine opening the app to learn that tomorrow there’s a 95% chance of rain. Now open 3 other apps (national weather service, local news weather and Apple weather. Guess what? Zero percent chance of rain from all three. But here’s the ticker, Accuweather will change the chances as things start to go sour for their failed services. I need reliability, not outlandish on the fly guess work. | Don't like the fact that people with seeing problem it is hard to see the print on light blue background would be nice if you would make the free app one that everyone could use !! The temperature is actually more on the mark than weather channel but I'll have to go back to weather channel because this free app isn't user friendly for everyone little disappointed ... | Paid version is not add free. | I just want the weather for the next day but I have to search to find the basics - temp rain. Make  it streamlined | This app used to be great but over time it’s gone downhill. It takes forever to load and is always glitchy. I would no longer recommend this app. | The ads could be smaller | Very slow to load. Otherwise, okay. | App is great as far as weather info. The downside is the app crashes or closes constantly. Using on updated Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. | Price increases!! No thanks I’m out !!!! | App bobbles around, won’t stay loaded, cannot see the percentage of rain at bottom of weekly temperature.
This app WAS fine, now it is aggrevating. I reloaded and still not good. Take advertising banner off app. Soo we can see full information.
Will be unloading and getting another weather app. | Did exact location. Sitting here looking out into the sunshine as it says it is raining and will be for the next hour??????????? | Deleting this | If I could give 10 stars, I would. This is by far the best, most accurate, easiest to read and use weather app I’ve ever used. And I’ve tried them all. | AccuWeather does a great job of reporting weather for me! It gives detailed information…especially regarding rain (radar, time of rain in my area, which is Plano, TX). It’s very helpful in planning my day!! :-) | I don’t know who is naive enough to trust this app. They tell you to remove then reinstall but it still doesn’t work, now the hourly page won’t update! I guess this what you can expect from woke weather. So sick of getting Spanish ads! Update now this horrible app isn’t able to show current weather conditions in various locations. | The new version’s radar map is better, but nothing else is. Can’t report conditions any more and a daily precipitation total would be very helpful. | Not able to get weather for this town! Weird that the app picks up places all over the world. I just want USA. Thanks | Inaccurate weather app is more like it! Showing 90% chance of rain and 4 other apps plus the national weather service saying 0%!!! | Came 2 days late. | Weather features are great. I love the minutecast option. The full page advertisement on the hourly page is so annoying with how it hides its X out by a timer. | I appreciate your weather app. It’s usually accurate for me in the Los Angeles county. 
The weather videos you provide are not very visible on my cellphone.  Please spend the money to make them able to expand. 
Lastly, I do NOT appreciate the panel that blots out the last seconds of your weather videos.  Those panels are NOT NECESSARY.  
If they persist I will have no problem blotting out the entire videos.

Annoying… | This app is a rip off. Needed to cancel my order due to an emergency and they said they had no problem canceling the order but refused to refund me. | The email said ""35% discount added at checkout."" However, at checkout, rather than a $37.00 discount, a whopping $10.00 was taken off of my total order. 
I am not counting taxes, service fees or tips. Upon checkout, it clearly stated ""Promotion $10.00."" When one orders more than $125 worth of food, it is very disappointing to be surprised with a misleading promotion. 
I guess it's back to Door Dash for me. | Have tried numerous times by calling and emailing to delete and cancel my account. Was told account was deleted and they have no information however they continue to TAKE My MONEY!! Have never even used their service !!! Total disgrace and no customer service person has helped. | Fantastic food!! | After multiple attempts at receiving a refund and not getting one for the same order delivered to the old address twice! I have made a third to finally get my meal! After contacting the driver before the order was even picked up to notify them that the last one had gone to an old address he said there was nothing he could do to help me out and that I had to reach out to Customer Service , who has been zero help thus far! demanding refund for two orders that were lost to Evo wok! | I thought I’d try this instead of doordash and I regret it. I was wondering how they help about their drivers just taking peoples food and they didn’t care. Their customer service is absolute garbage. My driver literally just grabbed my food then proceeded to go the opposite way of me by miles!! I will never be using grubhub again. They need to tell customers if their driver is going on other pickups. | Grubhub will give $5-10 compensation and get on with it. Whether they gave you meat instead pf vegetarian food or hurt you dietary restrictions/ religious beliefs customer service will just give you cold sorry and refund that’s it. No improving situation, company without ethics, no stopping it from happening again, no shame, no restrictions on the restaurants they work with nothing. We gave you pork instead of vegetarian sorry. Beef instead of vegan sorry. Get your REFUND and shut up this is how grubhub worked-works-will work. | Every delivery I have had has been as fast as they could. Sometimes even faster than the actual deliverers that work theres… I get constantly updated how the delivery is coming along. No inconveniences and/or food tampering like people told me happens with these types of companies… They won’t hesitate to contact you if there is a problem. Overall one reliable delivery service. | This app does not allow me to submit any issues I have with my orders or deliveries while using voiceover, my screen reader. So if something is wrong with my order or delivery, I am screwed by both the restaurant and GrubHub since I am blind. | Literally don’t do it if you want your money there rip offs they will take your money just download ubereats don’t give them a chance that will be a big mistake | Grubhub really needs to get a system where we can rate the drivers and remove their tip. I’ve had this membership for years and I quite often end up with my food being undelivered. Constantly trying to contact the driver and nothing. These people just get free meals off of customers and we get a measly credit. There have been times I’ve waiting upwards to an hour for the driver to steal my food and then have to turn around and order again then pray it doesn’t happen for a 2nd time. Drivers (not all) do better, Grubhub start reprimanding those that do this! | We ordered $52 worth of food. Was left Dramamine from 7-11. Called the driver, was sent to VM twice. After 25 minutes to talk to someone, we were offered a $7 credit. This is by FAR THE WORST EXPERIENCE! Do not use this service ever! I promise it will be regretted!!! | Ordered a sandwich, didn’t come. Instead of a refund all they gave me was a 10 dollar coupon that expires in a week. Will never use again, awful service!!! | Please make it more clear to customers that the written reviews are not for their delivery speed/driver. People are messing up restaurant ratings by voting 1 star because of the driver. I otherwise love grubhub, hence the 5 stars. | WHY ARE THE DELIVERY COSTS SO EXCESSIVE

50% UPCHARGE OF THE TWO SANDWICHES | I've been using other competing apps and never encountered such an issue. I initially chose this app because my colleagues gifted me a card. Using the card for my first order, I found a missing item, which was promptly refunded after I reached out. However, the next day, I couldn't place any orders. Contacting customer service yielded vague explanations and no clear timeline for resolution. Considering becoming a Grubhub Plus member due to the card's substantial value, but now reconsidering that decision. | I received the wrong order and the only fix was to refund me. I was on a timeframe for my lunch and due to this I was unable to eat. This is ridiculous and I wonder how many times this happens in a given day. I should receive a partial refund and have an order expedited to me asap. I can’t understand how this is any kind of a good business model. Won’t be using ever again since I cannot trust that I will actually get a meal. | This is the third time I’ve placed an order and when I went to pick it up, the restaurant had no record of the order having been placed even though the app lists it as “in the works”

Look, Grubhub, if I wanted to wait on site for them to prepare my food, I wouldn’t have bothered using your app. And moving forward, I don’t plan to use an app that only works about 20% anyway. | I preorder in advance and later I received a call telling me they do not have idli, so I asked if they could do anything about it. They said they could not update the order and instead told me to cancel and reorder again. I told them that if I cancelled I would not reorder again, so if they could change it to something else I would be ok as long as the price was close, the employee was not helpful but in the end the proposal was accepted.

 This feature should be in the restaurant and other providers app so that they can cancel the product that is not on their menu and update the order price accordingly. This ruins preorder since later you can get an out of stock call and now you’re plans are changed, which happens but with an app and such a big infrastructure supporting it behind, an easy product update for the order with a click saves time and money to everyone involved. The restaurant does not loose the order, the user does not loose their time and grub gets another user engaged.

I know there are more steps involved than just allowing restaurants to change the orders but there must be a way. | Seriously tho. How hard is it to pick up pizza drive it somewhere and drop it off? This is the second time people couldn't pick something up drive it somewhere and drop it off is this really that hard really? | 5 failed deliveries in a row. I never received the first four deliveries, one is still pending my refund. 5th and final order was Pollo Loco, 3 minutes away. Driver took my food at 5:25pm and went on another delivery first. I received the food late and it was placed on its side on my porch. Cold soggy nachos and cold everything else. $50 completely wasted. The $7.00 voucher from the previous canceled orders covered the driver’s tip only. Fool me 5 times… never ever ever again Grubhub. | The worst experience today with customer support. There is some kind of UI glitch in grubhub app system. I ordered two items and it lets you add an item “BUT” instead of adding one item it repeats everything with addon as a whole new order. I ordered and it gave me confirmation on the app for the order being prepared and delivered. But coming back home I see two separate orders and charged my account twice- first order with 2items and second order with same 2 items and addon item repeated. Customer support dint even help me with refund or care to create a “ticket” raising glitch concerns. If the glitch is with grubhub and restaurant delivers you wont get refund. Complete ridiculous instance with no help and refund being an elite member. When I have the confirmation on the app why will I go and check my email back and forth, that is ridiculous. What is the use of an App if I had to check my emails for confirmation of orders. What is the use of even having membership with having no help. What will I do with your apology?Grubhub #badcustomerservice #nocustomerservice #dontorder #uiglitch | Would be better if customers were allowed to make changes, like no onions, etc. | I ordered a large delivery order from a restaurant.  Grub hub cancelled it one hour after ordering saying that the restaurant had closed.   I called the restaurant and not only was it open, they had the order made and waiting.   I ended up driving there to pick it up.   

Grub hub refunded the order but had no explanation for why they would have cancelled.  If they were going to cancel the order they should have done it immediately instead of waiting an hour. | I have 2 delivery apps. I’ve been using Grubhub more recently until now. I rarely have an issue. And customer service was fair. Ordered from Jack In The Box. Received alert my order is on the way. No other deliveries delays. My driver stopped mid way. I texted them if everything was okay. No response. I clicked on request about delivery delay. My order arrived just before being considered late. Noticed my drink did not have seal. All other bags had seals. So I requested “help” again. The drink was the only issue. Customer support said I had an unusually high request for refunds, discounts, and requests and can only give me a $5 credit. Great. But the “unusually high requests, refunds” comment was not justified. I sent request to delete my account. I canceled Grubhub + membership. 

Next time, just lead with $5 credit. And end it there. Now you have one less customer and revenue. | I only use this garbage app bc it’s free with a credit card. Overpriced food, overpriced service fees, free delivery only with a large purchase. Delayed food every time. Like a hour or more. No customer service Not worth it even when it’s free to me. | We ordered some IHOP pancakes through Grubhub.  IHOP is 2.5 miles away from our house.  Our ordered was placed at 11:04 am, around 11:40 am we get a notification that our order was delivered.  No picture of the delivery and our ring cameras never saw anyone delivering our food.  I walk outside and I look for our food out front and also the back of our house.  Nothing! I notify Grubhub and they ask me all kinds of questions.  They offer to re-order my food. I tell the lady, I agree but only if they make us fresh food and not deliver us the food they forgot on the first try. She assured me the food would be a new order and fresh.  Grubhub places a new order and we receive the “new” order just shy of 1 pm. This was supposed to be our breakfast! We get the order and it’s the original order! The receipt shows that the order was received by IHOP at 11:04 am and it stayed there for hours! Keep in mind we live 2.5 miles away from IHOP!! 

I submitted a guarantee for late delivery and I got a notification that my order was not eligible! If two hours late is not eligible for late delivery, what is? A day or two days? 

We have deleted this app and will use other services.  Thanks but no thanks. There are many delivery apps way better than Grubhub. Well be back to using DoorDash. 

Bye Grubhub. | Fees are out of control. But i’m hungry | the worst drivers | Of course these delivery apps are convenient except for when the delivery is extremely late , not due to the restaurant but because the delivery people take many orders from all over the place and get to you with a very late cold order . Also I’ve had guys leave the food outside the apartment building where it was stolen or outside of the apartment building in the cold , no call no doorbell ring . Rude . 
Then there were the times the app malfunctions and drops the order and for no reason it’s cancelled . 
So ok when it works it’s great but for what you charge none of this should be happening . | I made an order around 2 PM and the food was supposed to arrive between 2:30 PM and 2:45 PM after waiting till 245 extremely hungry and waiting for my food. The driver canceled my order saying that the store is closed. I contacted the restaurant and they say that they are open every day till 5 PM and they prepared my order and the driver just canceled out saying that the restaurant is close. This is unacceptable. I waited for my food. 45 minutes. Hungry and exhausted. until he canceled out they are on trustable | Ordered breakfast & the wrong item was delivered.  I did get a refund but then had to reorder.  Not the best way to start the day. | Grubhub doesn’t know how to treat customers! Rude agents will just offer you a $5 discount and disconnect your chat!!! | Don’t support Grubhub instead support the local business directly | Go direct to a restaurant website. Not uncommon for them to add $10 to the cost of a dish. | Get off of your lazy butt, get the food and save your money. | Grubhub is the best! Hands down! | Sometimes I’m busy working at home and I don’t have time to cook or prepare stuff. It’s a good service a little pricey, but if you want to eat if you’re drunk, they come to you with your food. | After having 2 problematic orders and 2 customer service agents who didn’t listen and definitely didn’t care, I deleted the app and will not place an order with Grubhub again. They outsource their customer service, so it’s one empty apology after another. They’ll apologize for apologizing, just so they don’t have to listen to anything you say. You can be as polite and patient with them as you like but make no mistake- your delivery issues are not their problem. | Before I could see my balance and now I can’t. | Always on time Always to perfection | Ruchvj | Convenience over quality. No attention to detail. High fees and no consistency. Orders are continuously late and often wrong. I purely use it for the conscience. Don’t expect quality. | The worst food delivery app. Literally anything else is better. | I downloaded this app, and I got stronger and more productive!! Better the Gym, and better than the movies!!! Xoxox | If you call the restaurant you will find the prices are MUCH cheaper than they are in the app. We got this app free for a year through our bank. Can’t wait to delete it. Too expensive. I ordered the exact same thing and went to pick it up myself…. $11.78 cheaper. We are done with this app. | I would like to be able to add driver to after I received the delivery. Many drivers don’t follow the instructions Like I put in the order.

The past trips are also hidden pretty well from the app so basically you’ll need to pay some effort to log in your miles. | Enjoyed all the features this app has to offer. | No communication skills | I’ve used this app the three times I’ve flown with the airline and it’s been very helpful with check in, boarding and any necessary updates. The airline is awful, and I’m done with them after multiple bad experiences, so I’m deleting the app. But if you are flying with them, the app is a must have. I got notifications on my multiple delays and cancellations before announcements were made, and was able to rebook in the app, and not call the very rude people at their rebooking line again. | Best app hands down compared to all the other airline apps! | Flight was delayed continuously, the information provided by the app and personnel at the airport was truly lies. They knew it was impossible to take off in 10 min when the aircraft or flight attendants were not there and boarding was not started. Truly a joke. Very different from other airlines these days | For some reason my app takes a while for the check in option to appear when it’s time to check in. I get notifications but am unable to do so on the app. I’ve even sat next to a friend to check in on the same flight and they have no issues. I’ve reinstalled the all several times. | Por Favor. Es de gran interés que intenten agregar el idioma español a la aplicación. Gracias | We had the best flight thanks to a wonderful and personable flight attendant named Imran Chaudhry . It started the moment we walked onto the plane by Imran welcoming us and saying Happy 60th birthday ! He continued his hospitality throughout the whole flight with a smile and made us feel very special. I wish there were more flight attendants like him !! | Ticket booking thru iPhone, the primary phone number country code selection dropdown not working. 

Fix it ASAP!!! | Sometimes doesn’t find your flight. Doesn’t update seats on boarding pass. Can’t communicate with partner airlines. The in-flight entertainment and WiFi are cumbersome to get to. It seems they have one site that explains what’s available and another site that plays it. | I was very happy with the chat service and the quick change to an upcoming reservation!  All worked out and was efficient!  Well done AA! | Their check-in process was anything BUT quick or easy!! They needed a ton of info from me that should’ve been requested PRIOR TO check-in!! It took me 16 minutes to check in due to vague errors stating “something went wrong” (TWICE) and then miraculously working after I hadn’t entered anything new! I had to enter my passport info on two separate screens. Why wasn’t this requested beforehand. Now I’m in the last boarding group. | I would travel Spirit over AA. At least they know what they are. | How in the world does luggage not get transferred to the connecting plane 
Such an inconvenience 
I’m over airlines | My TSA pre-check never shows up on my mobile ticket. I always have to get a printed ticket so I can use the TSA pre-check, I cannot stand this, it’s so frustrating, it should not be this hard. | Buggy app does not work most of the time | 1) does not notify when time to check in (yes banner notifications are active)
2) requires a confirmation or ticket number in order to find travel. Seriously? I logged in and you don’t have my ticketed travel available to choose from?
3) adding details to my account and the form returns error because I cannot select that area code for emergency contact. I don’t care about that, just let me add details modularity (one piece at a time) so even if your layouts are messed up I can at least provide you with my known traveler number.
OY | AA customer service has always treated customer as secondary.  Other airlines do much better. | I was scheduled to fly from Las Vegas to Dallas at 11:00am on Saturday, April 20th, however after several delays the flight was inadvertently cancelled. My flight was rebooked for a 7:00 am departure on Sunday, April 21st. I received a message around 9pm on Saturday night that the 7:00am flight was cancelled as well. We were rebooked on the 11:00am flight. To make a long story short we have been delayed 5 times and the last update the time was changed to 4:05pm. There have been several flights leaving Las Vegas going to Dallas and we have been unable to get booked on any of these flights. This has been by far the worst experience I’ve ever had with American!! 

Pamela L. Malvern | When you cancel a trip the app or website does not make it clear or allow you to just cancel one person in the trip. Recently my wife tried to cancel her ticket but ended up canceling all tickets in the family because it wasn’t clear to her in the user experience that she was doing this | Lost bags down graded seats and canceled my flight. Stellar performance | My next flight will not appear in the app. Very inconvenient when trying to change it. | Baggage could but be tracked. | Incorrect information about bags | The baggage tracker module does not work. | After changing my flight all because I was 1 minute late even though I was standing in line waiting to be checked in. Then flying back home I checked my luggage and it did not leave the original airport. Trying to be understanding I went to the ticket counter multiple times asking if they had any information about my luggage. The 4th trip to the ticket counter I finally got something other than just go to the baggage claim and wait. The great news I received was that my luggage is still setting in Washington DC and you can swing by here sometime around 10 or 10:30  pm that makes you feel super confident in the ability of American Airlines and just shows you how valued you are as a customer! | Saturday travel to Key West ruined due to multiple equipment issues (plane and TUG) in CLT airport.  Still sitting here waiting to get to my family vacation while AA sorts it out. Very disappointing. | I have generally loved this app for several years, but recently the dialogue box for entering the contact phone number has been broken, and I have had to go on a browser to complete reservations. PLEASE FIX THIS! | Flight attendant in first class was just rude | UA/DL have much better tech in their apps! Just saying… | Americans Admiral Clubs continue to go downhill. 
They are always over crowded. The food is lower quality and almost always in short supply. They keep increasing the cost of their affinity cards and the number of miles that it takes to qualify for higher rewards!
Ticket prices and profits are soaring but they are not investing in keeping their loyal fliers.

Time for a new airline to beat the big carriers by offering good service and amenities at fair prices! | While I appreciate American Airlines as my chosen carrier, I find their digital presence lacking. The AA app is riddled with numerous bugs, making it challenging for me to manage my reservations or check in efficiently. The app frequently times out and moves at a sluggish pace, giving the impression of being stuck in an endless cycle of processing. This experience is incredibly frustrating, especially when I'm unable to complete basic tasks and must resort to using a computer to access my reservation. It raises the question: what's the purpose of the app if it doesn't serve its intended function? This issue isn't isolated to my iPhone 14 Pro Max; users across various iOS devices are facing similar challenges. My disappointment is profound. Despite eagerly downloading the app update in hopes of “addressing the bugs”, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Unfortunately, the update did not resolve the issues, leaving me disheartened. It seems the bug spray being used is ineffective, as the app continues to struggle with the same issues. Until these issues are resolved, I'll have to reconsider booking future flights with American Airlines. | The crew at SFO made us gate check our bags. They were totally hysterical to the passengers waiting to check in. Once we got on board, we noticed all the over head bins were mostly empty. Now we’re waiting to get our carry on which is going to cause us to be late to our meeting. The crew needs to do a better job of managing the overhead space. I am a frequent traveler and I pack a carry on for a reason. This is one reason I don’t fly with American anymore.
Wendy Toth | Be prepared for completely unexpected random passport screenings that will prevent you from checking in, and when you check in a couple hours late your window seats will be given away and you get stuck with middle seats despite paying a premium to be able to select your specific seat. | Standing here for more than an hour waiting for my luggage 
flights that came in after mine have gotten their bags masked agent what’s going on they said they don’t know. It’s been unloaded. That’s all they could tell me. | On the flight purchase page, the phone number “select phone number” drop down doesn’t work.

It blinks briefly but doesn’t render.

I cannot proceed | Seems the good folks of AA may be spending too much money on hush payments with Boeing and not enough to keep their app up or airplanes flying. Plenty of time for me to sit here at the gate waiting for ongoing flight delays to contemplate the various deficiencies of the leadership team at AA and how short their tenure must be before getting fired. Can’t wait to see what the next round of morons elect to spend money on. | The American Airlines is a great app. I love the map feature in the app and the ability to track my bags! | I tried to log onto the onboard entertainment. I received an error that said the browser was not supported. So I switched from chrome to safari and got the same error message. | Horrible baggage handling. You somehow managed to lose our bags during a two hour layover in Miami. I expect a full refund of baggage fees and flight fare. Thanks for ruining our vacation. 

Todd Fogle | A very convenient application, but it is impossible to enter the emergency contact phone number. I suppose there is work for testers and developers. | In the span of two years, American has easily become the worst Airline. There is no experience flying with American. It’s all about profits with this company. The service is terrible. Many of the desk hostesses are just rude. Status is merely a status symbol with no real benefits and your still treated poorly. Flights are constantly late to depart and arrive and planes have consistent maintenance problems. | Your app has errors every time I use it ugh fix it | We have not received our bags which are vital since we are here for our daughter wedding
Last trip one of our suitcases never arrived and had to go through a long a tedious process to get partially reimbursed | This is the first time I’ve flown with American, and it was a great experience. On the way home from Phoenix we hit some really bad weather, and it was the scariest flight I’ve been on BUT I cannot thank the pilots enough for getting us to CID safely, and showing their true compassion for their job during the flight. I will be flying with American again soon. | I’ve had so many issues booking and changing flights with AA’s app. Rarely do my changes or purchases go through and I have to get on the phone with a representative to get them implemented. Multiple times now I have lost out on better prices or seats because of their inability to build a working app. It has gotten to the point where I actively avoid traveling with American. | La aerolínea a decaído muchísimo cuando no te dejan botada se pierden las maletas , ya es la 2 vez q pago los dineros q quiero y después te sientan donde la da la gana a ella o sea si vas en familia y quieres viajar juntos no pagues asientos q es por gusto ellos te sientan todos regados por el vuelo ✈️ yo la verdad estoy muy desilusionada de lo que fue AA ya no queda nada 👎🏿 | genuinely an awful airline service. i’ve dealt with a fair share amount of airline issues and delays but american airlines doesn’t even care to tell you until it’s too late. we had a flight scheduled at 5:30pm 4/15, got delayed until 6:50pm, got delayed again until 9pm, then got delayed all the way to 7am with denial of compensation. we got up at 5 to make a 7am flight just to be told it got pushed back AGAIN to 12 pm. now i’m missing work all because of an illegitimate business. | I am logged in with my account, so all my info is pre-filled out when I go through the booking process. But if I change my mileage plan to a different airline, it says “are you changing passengers?” and my only options are “yes” or “cancel” and of course i have to say “yes” and it completely resets the form, and I have to fill everything out manually.

When I FINALLY get to the payment screen, I leave the app to make sure I have my dates correct, and when i got back to the app, it takes me back to the main home screen!!!! so i have to do it all over again.

It’s not even for scanning - I just wanted to see membership info. | Can you guys add a bar code as well on the app? So we can use the app also in other countries.
Right now its impossible to use it in Mexico because they have the system on Bar Code reader, and US app uses QR code. Thanks | Your app is not user friendly to see if you have items in stock or price check., | I would like to be able to order grocery products on standard shipping rather than having to use the two day delivery. | The app has always been a clunky experience that seems to be 5-10 years behind other modern apps. The latest update inexplicably removed the ability to share/copy a link to a product, now you can only share to social media. Whoever is in charge of this app development needs to be fired. | My husband and I enjoy going to costco since we can find things easily with affordable price. | Useless.  App doesn’t even open. | The app developers need to update the app. If it’s asking for a zip code - have the numerical value populate not the entire keyboard. The verify your account never works. Thought this would be a good subscription to have but the app leaves everything to be desired. | Need to be cognizant of the tabs across the top, and the fact that they show out of stock items as a default.  Can be tricky to navigate, so the interface takes some getting used to.  Ultimately gets the job done though! | The app more often than not fails to launch after the first time. If it does manage to successfully launch, it sometimes crashes or causes the phone to overheat. This started after the major update a few months ago. I can’t even use the app to show my digital membership card which is all I ever really used it for. They need to fix this app or support Apple Wallet for their membership. This has been going on for months. | I have found the app easy to navigate and the information is very helpful. | Costco next can’t check out. | To be sent an email or phone call of GOLD COINS being available for purchase. | Very easy to navigate, makes shopping for home supplies more convenient | Costco forces you to update their app before using. Once you do this, there’s now a digital membership card that can only be used in one device! Most of us go between two or more devices, like a phone and tablet. Now the customer must choose, with no warning and no work-around. This is one of the most digital user unfriendly stores. Makes me rethink my membership. | Can’t order what I see in store. | Very annoying app. 
App keeps loading stuff from the web. Why can’t the monthly deals be seen more easily? You have to scroll around now looking. 

Why can you add to your list from the deals? Shopping in the app is frustrating. | Love everything about Costco from the clothes to the food to the service. You never can go wrong with Costco. | Not enough results related to search.  For example, shrubs returned one result which did not include boxwoods.   However a search for boxwood came up with the correct result.   Makes it hard to consider other alternatives. | I love Costco but their app is probably the worst shopping app I have every used. The only thing it is useful for is your digital membership card. | Most unusable app. No in store inventory. | Every time I order something through Costco online, the product is delivered in a timely manner, and great quality. | I would give Costco five stars except for their packaging. Most of it is impossible to recycle, and is often excessively excessive! as a corporation, I wish they would do more to go zero, or very low, waste. I find I am shopping less and less at Costco because of the packaging. Also, do I really need so many avocados? | 1.  Can not select more than 1 filter item at a time. Once touched, the filter closes and must be reopened to enter another filter item. Good apps allow selecting multiple features, then applies with a confirmation button. 

2. Why can’t I see what is available to buy in store. It appears that way but when entered into the shopping cart shows it as needed to be delivered to the store for pickup. 

There’s more but Im too frustrated to keep writing. | I mean it’s Costco.  
It’s Awesome, and I don’t even eat the samples. 
Or return things.  

Food court should host weddings as far as I’m concerned. 👰👰.  Love the joint. | It took a major part of my day but my order was finally accepted. | Quick and easy. | Easy to use! | With this version when I tap share it only allows me to share to Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter. 
It should be like the iOS native share sheet that allows AirDrop, Messages, and copying. 
Please fix. | Works well enough but there are glitches often where I have to reload the page. | Better | The online order works fine | I can’t believe I’d say it, but Sam’s has a better app. Costco needs to bring a similar feature like Scan & Go with Sam’s. I’m starting to shop less at Costco because of how long the lines get. Someone is going to get hurt one day, and all of it can be prevented by allowing for faster checkout. 
The app as it stands now is just a basic one. It’s basically a web page with touch interface. | Would be nice if it had Sam’s Club ability to scan and go right on your phone to pay and check out so that all you need to do at the door is show electronic receipt otherwise not very helpful just ok. | Search feature no longer works. It just reloads the home screen. Products do exist but you have to hunt them down in their category. I’ll pay more and just order on Amazon. | The app doesn’t let me add my membership or my last name to be able to confirm it. It freezes and it doesn’t let me do anything! | We travel a lot & preferred to see the warehouses pop up on the menu so we can tell which one is the closest in the direction we’re going. Now we just get a list at startup & it wants you to set your home store! I don’t want to change my home store while I’m traveling. Please change it back or give us the option to see the map. | Thanks | Why can’t I minimize the app during checkout to go look for credit card or shop card info and come back to the same screen! I add a shop card , and go to look for another one and when back on the app the previously entered card is gone and I’m back to the cart and have to click checkout again! Frustrating beyond belief! | If you have sensitive eyes, you need to be careful when accessing the account page/tab in the app. The app will force the brightness of your screen to the max level, literally blinding you!! Why!!! Almost felt like I tried to stare directly into high beams to burn my corneas. The app DOES NOT respect your phones display setting, please be careful!! I don't understand why Apple allows apps to bypass user defined settings like this! | Costco works with budget car rental and give veterans with service dogs a hard time and wanting to see forms (that I thought was illegal). Costco travel does not care | When trying to check out, I only see an error page now! | STOP telling me about your stupid app “tour”. Who cares. | Easy to navigate and make purchases. | The best and most reliable products at the lowest prices. | Can yall do something right and just put the warehouse savings somewhere actually visible. Why do I have to go through king tuts labrynth to find that. 

The 2016 app was 10000% better. Fix that. | If you want to read reviews, you can’t get past the first page due to the way the app is setup. You can’t scroll down far enough due to, ‘check availability’ feature getting in the way. | Love ordering on line or in store always great

Could not park although other scooters were parked in that area. Navigated to parking area and still was told I could not park. Card was held and charged on several rides today and the majority was spent trying to get into zones to park or ride freely. | I live two minutes down the street from work in Nashville and lime is my favorite way to go back and forth I love it great company | Fun ride really recommended | I simply love riding the scooter with my best friend!  
I just wish we had them in Va Beach! | I’m a truck driver broke down in Caldwell town over. So decided to come to farmers market and met the gentleman from lime green ride scooter he showed me how to set up and ride it so helpful and great way to see the city would definitely recommended to anyone | I like their scooters, although the app is deductively more difficult than others.  Our first ride had tons of billing problems because the app messed up, which got resolved. 

The real reason for the 1 star review is the app uses notifications to advertise their service. That ain’t cool. | This idea simply rocks! | What’s irritating about the pass that they sell you on by minutes is that it takes like 15 seconds to lock and if you go over by 2 seconds it takes a WHOLE minute away from your ride pass. That’s essentially theft for not letting me use the extra 58 seconds. Lime is already expensive as it is but the fact that they just take these seconds away from you is literally theft. | I was trying to pay for my ride and had to add cash and still says my card was declined | Great Service but expensive | I like a lime because the lime I like a lime I like a lime like a like, like a lime like like the lime… Because lime I like a D lime lime, likey likey lime likey | Love the option to use the bikes. 
Short rides are affordable. 
Needs to be a monthly subscription with unlimited 30 minute rides like in NY with Citibike. 
Longer rides are way too expensive and will probably avoid. 
Alway can find a bike close to me and they are charged! | I simply wanted to make a trip to the bank and it seemed to have a lot of dead zones, downtown Spokane,WA for some reason the whole spot was red so I ended having to walk for 2 miles with the scooter, and as soon as it got 1.3 mileage battery the area that was just red cleared up and I was able to ride for for the last 0.6 miles of my trip. All the areas that were a dead zone that I’ve walked through cleared up, I’m looking at the app like why wasn’t I able to ride earlier but now I can, and on top of that I was charged 36 bucks for a trip I wasn’t even able to ride. It was fun to ride the scooter but whatever system they have for the “dead zones” need to be fixed because earlier it was a dead zone and now that I passed it isn’t,  was very upsetting having to pay such amount when didn’t even really get to ride it. | Lime was cool back in the day but they’re getting too expensive to use.  Don’t take inflation and use it to your advantage. | Lime was not working on any street, even the ones that were not off limit zones and would not accelerate! when i tried to ride it when I paid for it but they were NOT WORKING! | You guys are the best can’t wait until you guys have it where your able to go to aurora as well | What an awesome experience | Finally decided to have a ride, spent 8 bucks constantly pushing/kicking a 10 pound scooter that didn’t have a motor or acceleration whatsoever. Thanks ! | if I compare the past Lime access points program’s price to current Lime access points programs. Then it’s  quite  clear  that the price has increased by 90% . For example, in the past Lime used to charge $0.04 per minutes but now it’s charging $0.40 per minutes. As a frequent customer of Lime , it’s quite shocking to see how much price has increased within a months in Lime Access Point programs. 

Earlier that in March I had Active Lime Access point as a result per minutes Limehas charged me $0.04 . On the other hand , in April lime Lime has stated that my Access point must need to be renewed. So, after renewing it ; I was getting charged  by $0.40 . | So basically I went on the scooters the process of paying was very difficult it wouldn’t let me put my card in. And when I got done riding it wouldn’t let me park and end it , while I left it there it charged my friend an extra fee in fair 25 total. Why charge per min when it should be charged per hour it doesn’t make sense. | Blue parking spots didn’t exist on my map | No to bad but pricey | Parking spots full but fun way to get around. | This app called Lime used to be very convenient and fun to use but now they’re asking for approximately $12 each ride as a hold on your card, I assume to make sure you pay. So not only do they a loan from me. They also want me to pay for the service to ride for a few minutes. I’m 100% sure there is a better method to make sure people pay because not only does this way seem suspect it’s also very inconvenient for a scooter that cost two dollars sometimes $.49 depending on how long you ride for. I’d rather just walk at this point. | Very bad app. Ask me to log in in the log in page. What the f does that mean? I am trying to log in bro. | My fault I didn’t end my ride correctly. Lime took care of me very nicely. Could have put the screws to me but did the right thing | Will do again | Honestly, this app is annoying to use and it makes it impossible to start, go on, or end your ride. First, to start the ride, it takes over 5 minutes and is still confusing to use at first. Then your actual ride is loud and not reasonable. I was on a bike and a friend of mine on a scooter. Her scooter was going maybe 5 mph, I can walk faster than that. My bike would wail and scream every five minutes. Besides, this e bike still was really slow. A fast walk would’ve been quicker. But the worst part of all was the end. My friend and I parked our bikes and tried to end the ride but lime wouldn’t let us because “we needed to park in a preferred parking area.” We were in a serious rush. Please note that there were several other bikes/scooters but they were in regular rotation. It’s a perfectly fine area. Then, we tried another area, same conditions, and the same thing happened. When it finally let it park our bikes, it was 10 minutes later and we had been charged $10 more than our trip would’ve been. I will not ever use this service again. Me and my friend saw that an Uber and a bike would be the same time, so we made the eco conscious choice. But it took so much longer- double the time, and was more expensive too- double the price. I would not recommend this to anyone. | Lime has become one of those things you used to use if need be. Now i stay as far as possible as i can from them. I recently grabbed one and it wouldn’t allow me to end the ride and it made my lime stop working. I had to push the lime back a total of 7 blocks and it charged me for the time that it was not working. I tried using the help buttom in the app but nothing changed so now im late to work and down money because the app failed me. | Took 15 dollar from my Apple Cash when I scanned the QR code to try to reserve it and I didn’t even end up using it or unlocking it | They over charge u DO NOT USE IT go to another scooter app literally bought 2 passes and got charged over $170 and they are still charging my card tried calling customer service and they was no help at all | Zoom | Difficult to understand how to do group rides | Great make me don’t late | App didn’t work so extra time was added on. | Unusubale. I was unable to return my scooter today. Tried everything, including reinstalling app and hard resetting phone. After reinstall couldn’t even log in due to constant network errors. Everything else on iPhone networks just fine. Cannot even get into menu to contact support. Simply useless, stay away. Get TIER instead. | Not sure what’s going on but couldn’t end my ride and bought a ride pass so we shall see what happens | these used to be okay but they’re a total rip off now | So today I was trying to get on a lime scooter and it won’t accept my money I used my cash app and my Apple Pay but it won’t accept it mind you It was working a couple of days ago so I don’t know why it won’t work. ONTOP of that I paid for the 30min day pass but it scammed me and just took my money with out letting me ride. | Go fast. | Good | Womp womp ur update crashed the app congrats | Can’t park anywhere and is more expensive than an Uber it’s stupid for anyone to use | It’s the slowest scooter in Denver and if you go anywhere near a no parking zone the scooter will stop despite the fact you should still be able to ride. Just walked a half mile in the rain before giving up on the scooter working again. Do yourself a favor and use Lyft. | The scooter was parked in the red zone, I didn’t realize it was. I was riding it, and it started moving so slow, they charged me for having it in the red zone. I wasn’t the one who put it there. It was too far for me to ride it to a non red zone and they were going to charge me. So I walked the scooter to where it originally was and didn’t realize they charged me 18 dollars twice. Because I wanted to confirm that it was already in the red zone. It was and then I ended the ride before the got to 1 minute therefore making me pay 18 again. I didn’t realize until I check my bank account. | Was a fun ride but battery wasn’t charged. | Tried several times to verify my identity. Had my drivers license perfectly legible. App wouldn’t recognize it so I couldn’t be verified. Delete! | Was smiling and laughing the whole ride. Super fun and easy. Ready to start a shooter gang!!

Then after membership renewed the last time it keep asking me to upgrade my membership. I would hit upgrade and it would say i was already a elite member. Yea i know….. refreshed my account and still didnt work. Delete app reinstall app sign in. Refresh purchase and it worked for about a day. Was out hunting trying to figure out where i was where i need to go and what property i was on (cause one boring property didn’t have permission and was close  to line to get to spot.) well app decided not to work again. No clue where exactly the line was. There i was trying to refresh membership. Didn’t get it to work. What a joke when ur out hunting. Had a gut full.  Wast of $100. | I absolutely love On X! I use it to find trail heads and backroads daily. | We bought our property in October of 2022 and now a year and a half later it still doesn’t show us as owners. Makes me skeptical of the other properties I’m looking at. Also the imagery is behind most other apps that I use. Many of the other features are easy to use and very helpful. | Been meaning to get ON-X for a few years now and I am really liking this and using it 
Perfect for keeping usable field notes 
Thanks Cory | What a great resource not only for hunting but for property ownership information. What a great tool! I use this app in Florida,Minnesota and Idaho. | Love I can download maps for when I have no service | Terrain, map overlays, property owners, GPS coordinates, elevation, the whole kitten kaboodle. I use it for backcountry driving, hiking, finding camping spots and land watching. | Every two minutes I’m having to click out of an ad, a real pain that makes a slow app even slower. | I use both versions all the time and they are outstanding.  In my Tundra, using CarPlay, i have a much moving topographical and satellite view of where  I am at AND my surroundings.   Ive been amazed at terrain, openings, water, etc. that I didn’t know was there even though I’ve hunted and explored for 25 years.  And, downloading and storing maps for places you know won’t have cell service is easy, you can cover a large area with the down loaded map with as much detail as you decide. | Priceless to know when you’re on public land and what is private, very helpful scouting areas and planning hunting trips with the terrain tools as well as the land measurement tools provided by onX | Maybe good in other states but for the price and the State of TN, this app is completely useless! | ONXHunt is a great app even if you don’t hunt a great mapping tool for property owners and finding your location even hiking knowing boundaries and property owners knowing where to go and where not to go so many uses for location if you don’t have it you should it should be required for everyone who works or plays outdoor even driving a vehicle looking for location a great app👍 | The new update breaks if you use VPN though | I’ve used OnX for years and I’ve loved it. However, recently the app has been very unreliable. It crashes constantly, and after I just bought the iPhone 15, the app doesn’t even load. When I open the app, it stays on the initial screen that’s red with the OnX logo. I’ve restarted my phone, my software is up to date and I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app several times. I’d love some help from OnX support on this issue but they’re hard to get a hold of… | OnX is the best app for hunting I have ever used and I have used just about all of them. Their support links are outstanding as well as the educational zoom links to answer any other issues or questions. Great program. I have 3 generations of hunters that use OnX app, exclusively!! | Would nice to have a map option that looks like google earth. Sometimes hard to see environment with the available map layouts. | Greatest mapping for hunting and great support team, I would like to see waypoints being live to see movement and interactions with other OnX members to view their movements on your own device and theirs , this would be awesome during deer drives to actually see drivers in motion and safer, I’m sure this will be available in the future | Been like this for awhile. | The support is easy to contact and work with. The easy button. | Beware of the sneaky charges they’ll place on your account! I was charged $99.99 for a FREE 1 week trial of the Elite membership. I’ve never ever used the app before this and now the customer service team is backpedaling saying that they cannot issue me a refund and Apple Support told me that I need to contact them for a refund. It’s a whole mess so just be careful because they will charge you even though you didn’t sign up! | Awesome maps. Awesome response from you guys!! Couldn’t be happier | This app is a game changer for those of us that hunt public ground.  It’s real easy to lose track of where public and private meet when your tracking/stalking that deer or turkey.  This app will show that even without cell service.  Plus being able to map out a track in a new area is handy, especially a new area where you’ll be going in the dark.  We was stalking turkey today and kept getting further and further in the woods, but I knew there was private land close to us.  It was nice to know we wasn’t trespassing.  Thanks OnX. | The satellite map used by onX is very dated. It is years old; at least 3 years old in Missouri. Makes it difficult to hunt, scout, and know areas when the map is so old. Would be much better if the satellite imaging and map were up to date more-so. | OnX Has been the most up to date and feature-rich app I’ve used for knowing I’m on the land parcel I should be on and helping me to get in, to my chosen destination, and back out without any confusion. Great and prompt customer service.
Ken | Really helps with boundaries and private land! | Folders not working on iPhone 14 for over a year now | I really wish the people that made these apps would have a real people that you could talk to about your problem but nope. Contact support sure I tried all I get is a freaking computer. Put a phone number on your stuff… please!! | After an update now I can no longer view the property boundaries and basic info. They real you in and then take away what you use it for and place behind a pay wall. I’m fine with adding feature and charging for them. But it gets old when you take away feature that were free to begin with. | It’s a great app when it works but I’ve already lost all my information three times because the app won’t open even though my phone is currently up to date on software updates and so is the app I’m disappointed in the app because of that but other then that it’s great for saving spots I’ve been using this app for 4 years now but it always seems to bug out making me look at other hunting apps | I’ve had an elite member ship for 3 months then out of knowhere I’m back to basic. My app is fully up to date and can’t even load. It stays on the orange screen that you get before it loads in no matter how good my service or wifi is and customer service has so far been a waste of time. | This app is fantastic! I won’t go in the woods or mountains without it…… on-x Hunt is constantly updating and improving the app to give us the best product available. The various functions are very accurate and super easy to use! | Please make a faster way to delete points and other markups. It’s very time consuming to delete old points from past forestry projects. I don’t know why after a share a folder I can no longer delete everything that’s on my screen. | I pay for premium yearly membership and can’t even get app to open. | This app is a scam. Downloaded to see property lines. Was offered a 7 day free trial. Sign up and $20.51 immediately comes out of my account. 7 days later another $29.99 comes out. $50 and I STILL CANT SEE PROPERTY LINES. Do not download. I want my money back. | I do hunt but this is good for just roaming around the property. | My app will still not open. This has been going on for more than 6months. It would be nice if someone would reach out and get this fixed. I have been paying for this app for years. It use to work great but now it will not open. | Loved the app till a couple weeks ago. 
Then, when you go to use it, it just stays on the red loading page. I hit app support, and it takes me to a OPPS NO LONGER EXISTS page. 
Paying $30 /year. Deleted and downloaded it again three times. | I made a six years old. I have a Can-Am defender and I cruise all over the area. I meet my neighbors. I can even see who owns the property love
This software | the app used to work good unfortunately it had an update now. It never will load at all. | So far I’m having a good time seeing who owns the property I’m able to hunt!!!! | Best hunting App out there. Going on hunting trip on one of the Hawaiian Islands for axis deer and have been able to scout and plan the whole trip using this App | Signed up for a free trial and they charged me for it after I chose to cancel | I have been using Motion X GPS for years, which was one of the first hunting apps available.  Now using On X, there is no comparison.  People that are using Google are using a bare bone app with limited tools.   “On X” provides property line in bright colors for both private and public land where Motion X used a fine gray line that was extremely difficult to see.  There are built in compasses showing the direction you are going, tracking devices, built in range finding and the ability to share information with other users.  There are too many features to list on a review and I strongly go to YouTube to view On X tutorials to gain a better understanding of all the capabilities.  On X will soon add a feature ysed with the Major Range Finder Manufacturers (Leica) which uses google to drop waypoints for exact location of where game was shot or known expired to retrieve in various different terrain. This by far is the most advanced product on the market. The advantage of this product is that is its continuous upgrading and added features to maintain its #1 rating in the market.  Customer support is 2nd to none.  Thank you for providing the best product that I have ever used that is irreplaceable in the hunting and outdoor environment. | We are thrilled that your application has been a tremendous help in our Volunteer Search Efforts for Elijah Vue.
Being able to apply the premium program aids us with land owners,
along with the type of terrain we need to walk through. The ability to create files of section maps improves on our efficiency. | I’ve used onX Offroad for a few years, I absolutely love it. I also use onX Hunt and onX Back-country.  Each has its own uses and additional features.  I only wish that there was an “all in one” desktop application and possibly even “all-in-one app”. It would reduce the frustration of changing apps for some of the things I do. | I use this app for my forestry business. It is accurate, reliable, and user friendly. I have been a long term user of Arcgis and Avenza. OnX has replaced my need for the others and at a much better price. 5 stars coming from the forestry community. | This the best hunting app out there | Great Application to have on your phone. Would not leave home without it. | Super for real work!
Dr. john | I’m new to using onX.

My suggestion is this give off good vibes and you will receive good vibes back 😊 Thank you JetBlue ✈️ | It’s disappointing that a cup of water is given to hit the baby bottles while the baby scream for her bottle and making the flight experience horrible

Super friendly, attentive and helpful customer service makes flying enjoyable. | Una súper aerolínea | La experiencia es súper de verdad no me quejo | Easy to make changes! | On Wednesday, April 3. 2024, I flew from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Austin, Texas. Although the flight was delayed, the flight attendants could not have been nicer. The young man who was the head flight attendant was very funny and entertaining. it was evident that the flight attendants were focused on our safety. I am extremely upset because JetBlue is ending the flights between Fort Lauderdale and Austin. I have relied upon JetBlue to visit my relatives in Austin for at least six years. The other airlines choices that are nonstop are abysmal. I wish that corporate would reconsider ending this route. My children who fly from Austin to Fort Lauderdale, are equally concerned about this change. Every flight that I have taken from Fort Lauderdale to Austin, or Austin to Fort Lauderdale is usually full. That’s why I don’t understand why you are ending the service. Please reconsider.

Loyal Jet Blue member | It would be nice for you all to have a way to recognize connecting flight issues. We are coming back from the from Punta Cana, DR to Boston  on flight that you all delayed by 1.5 hours. We had a 2.5 hour layover built in so now we will only have 1 hour to get through customs, security, and to a different terminal. I hope you all recognize that this is affecting 14 people in our party. Yet to see the outcome…..4/4/24—Scott | Update requires iOS 16.  My phone is at 15.8 with no ability to update to 16.
Boarding passes don’t generate.
Not a happy traveler right now…. | Wayyyyy better than calling for customer service. Can do everything to manage your reservation on the app, add bags, select seats, even change your flight! There’s confirmation every step of the way so you don’t accidentally purchase or make a change you don’t want to make. Even the option to chat with a representative | Easy to use , to work your way around.  As the words suggests Tru Blue | Does what I need it to . Hopefully they bring back the badges soon . That was a fun little thing to do while traveling/ going to new places | While traveling from Puerto Plata to New York JFK Flight 1528 on April 2, 2024. I have always been told while waiting to use the lavatory not to stand in the forward gallery area but to always stand behind the line by where the first seats are……. This is why yesterday I found it much to my surprise when 2 passengers an elderly woman who was sitting in seat 1D and and another man in his 60’s was allowed to stand there for over 30 minutes laughing and talking with 3 crew members (a lady and 2 males) all of Latin descent. The male passenger was even drinking wine in a plastic cup. During this time on several occasions we experienced turbulence and the Pilot announced for everyone to remain in their seats and buckle up your seatbelts. And these 2 passengers was allowed to stay in the forward gallery area all while intending bathroom users had to excuse themselves and navigate through these 5 people who had congregated in this small area for well over 30 minutes…… In all my years of travel and this being the first time in 9 years I haven’t made Mosaic Status, I’ve never experienced anything remotely close to this…. | This is the second trip we have booked with JetBlue this year that in the process of entering our information and hitting ‘process’, our flight has increased in price within a matter of a minute. This is very upsetting as we prefer to book with JetBlue and seem to be having this issue frequently | JetBlue is the best airline in the world 😎 | Employees at JetBlue are always kind and accommodating. It's wonderful how we can help ourselves to snacks and beverages. Thanks to JetBlue I have discovered Seagram's ginger ale which is now my favorite beverage. I always look forward to my flights on JetBlue!😃 | Since day one their app has been user friendly!  ❤️ | Yes JetBlue is the best airline 💙 | Always kicks me out of booking flights, websites and app freezes, just overall pathetic. | Customer service is always professional and polite. | I was just trying to book my flight and it showed one price then it didn’t let me booked then the price went up that’s unbelievable and getting over on people. | Way to go | The app crashes if you have to switch between screens to fill in information from ID docs, and after all that, your trip does not automatically display on the dashboard, so you have to re input your confirmation number and if you had to retrieve that info from an email or etc. it glitches and closes… return to go, do not collect $200. | Great UX and details like circling the times on the boarding pass are extra fabulous. I think it may be the best airline app in my phone, and I’ve got them all. | been flying with Jet Blue because service is good. | Pretty effective app | Everything departing from Sfo to Fll very smooth. Departing from FLL horrible. I knew as a tvl coordinator were allowed one carry on 45 inches plus a back pack and your purse. This was not applied and made it difficult managing my handheld personal items, very embarrassing. Once we passed through security I kept seeing many passengers with backpack, carry on 45 inches plus shopping bags. Not fair. Please stay true. Harassment unnecessary. | Yay | I always check Jet Blue before making any trip plans.  As a 6”4” high traveler the extra legroom is priceless at standard fares.
Staff are always courteous .
It’s my Go-To Airline.
Always look for their email specials. | This app makes tracking your flight so much easier! | En mi vuelo de regreso no me está dejando agregar maleta extra. | The app doesn’t not let you log out of your account.  When booking travel for a family, one sometimes need to switch between accounts. I have tried deleting the app, erasing cookies, deleting and shutting down the phone then reinstalling, turning off cookies, and I spent over an hour with tech support for the app. This could be easily solved if the “log out” button in the app actually worked.

Have to purchase everything, carry-on baggage, checked baggage, seats. Surprised they don't charge for restrooms. | Cool app | I have been flying Spirit for 20 years!
Spirit is my go to for all of my flights.
LOVE SPIRIT ❤️ | It is disappointing that my checked bag costs more than my round trip ticket. | Never going to fly Spirit again. I bought them as a budget flight, but ended up spending way, way more on luggage than I would have if I would have just flown a normal flight. Not even a complimentary cup of water. | Very easy | Service 5 starts | So I had a flight yesterday at 6:40 pm from Kansas City back home to Ft. Lauderdale. The flight was delayed several times until 2 am that evening when they cancelled it. No real explanation was given. We got a hotel room for the night which I appreciated but regardless I’m getting home a day late. Luckily, I had planned for this because everyone I know told me they had a similar experience with Spirit. If I had to work today this review would have been a lot angrier. Not giving up on Spirit, but I have been left with a bad experience | Buenos precios, me gusta mucho por que a mi y mi familia nos encanta viajar. Por esa razón se hace posible cumplir el sueño de descubrir nuevos lugares. 

Muchas gracias | So good, love it | Best experience ever on a flight stewardess was outstanding | I truly don’t understand why it was so difficult to book my flight | Not the best service | Excelente | Th chat service is a joke. I was on for hours asking for help to get my wife home.on an earlier flight after being in the emergency room for hours trying hen dorectefnto a 2-3 hour chat to be charged $69.00 and nothing done so she can sit in a seat with more room.  Spirit is about making money.regardless of the circumstances. I am.watching my wife sleep after crying for hours in the emergency room. Ask for help from the airline, what you get is a up charge to move and waisted time. That’s not service and I will not use an airline that can’t see that. | Spirit has always been on time for the flights I’ve taken.   Their counter staff at MIA are fantastic!
For the most part the staff on board are pretty good.   I really wish Spirit hadn’t changed their schedule because it was perfect before.  Their competition has the most uncomfortable seats I’ve ever used.  So now on my monthly trips I either have to brave those awful seats for  my trip or stay an extra day or so. | The price that you charge for a suit and luggage and the carry-on is outrageous. Probably will never fly with you again. Definitely not a discount a rip off. | I’m don’t understand why I’m paying for a seat again when I’ve already paid for it when I purchased the ticket. Make it make sense Spirit Airlines 🥴 | So many problems with one flight and we (me and 20 more passengers) are still in the airport waiting for another flight because of Spirit delay and weird transfer services. There is also no one here to solve our problem. Its purnlqst time to use this trash airlines. Its better to pay 100$ more and fly normally. Costumer services and information is  0 out 5 stars | I am always happy with spirit.
When I travel Cartagena- Ft Lauderdale, everything is perfect.
On the other hand, when I travel Ft Lauderdale- Cartagena, there are always long lines everywhere. Lines at the counter, customs, the airport and the waiting rooms are always packed and messy.
The flights are very nice ( once you are on the plane).
Thanks | Me encanta viajar por esta aerolínea , siempre me han dado súper servicio , solamente no me gusta los precios de el equipaje es alto . | Good airline | The update didn’t upload. Everything else was good… | The people over the phone don’t understand anything I said and I was having a hard time to understand them too. It took over two hours to assist me. End up going online with the chat to get help with the automated which doesn’t work either. I wish I didn’t have spirit anymore. It is a nightmare. The agents has different prices than the app. The just steal from you. Very disappointing | They sold me ticket by mistake with wrong departure and don’t want to return my money in 3 minutes after that. | Everything so far has been great | My saver account is not registering to book a flight even though the $69.95 is paid. You can never speak directly to a customer service rep. This is a bereavement flight and is a difficult trip on its own. I will be sure to copy this on all social media. | We had the most difficult time checking in and working the app and website. | Pretty bad tactics hitting a person for $79 for a carry on. 

If you have a family of 4 you rob them.

To me, I have the money and friends said I should try Spirit rather then the long standing airlines I travel on. 

It makes a person with a brain think, what mechanical or other tactic are they hiding from customers. | Checking in was fast and easy. Great job | Excelente compra rapida | Extremely disappointed in the pushy, sales-y feel to travel with a budget airline. | Hate this airline. Bait with low fare the hook you with add on cost for FIRST carry on. 
Ripoff. Avoid. | Spirit charges extra for everything imaginable.  This is my 1st & last flight on spirit. | Affirming-professional attire & attitudes. As well as friendly, energetic and accomodating as allowed by Spirit protocol. Free ice. Wow thank you, Spirit! Be real. | Overall enjoying the Spirit Airlines app. When I purchased our flights I “boosted” our tickets and it said we have 50lbs weight allowance for our checked baggage. Now during online check in it is saying only up to 40lbs. This is a big difference, up to 30lbs for all three of our checked bags. Now I’ll have to potentially under pack to avoid getting hit with a last minute heavy luggage fee. Frustrating. | Appreciate the method of confirming the flights online! | Always easy and accurate | Do not fly spirit. You are going to be disappointed. Use your money to buy a ticket at Delta, jet blue, American Airlines, etc. all the hidden fee and horrible service is extremely unbearable. I paid way more than I could imagine and on top of that the Orlando agent are the absolute worst. | Facil y práctico de usar | Won’t let me take  carry on bag and made me check it, lol. I’ve flown with the same bag for three years with reputable Airline companies lol | Thaank you | Childish for charging people for bags. Extremely high for such a basic flight service. Will NOT fly spirit again. Promise that | This website is very easy to follow. Should always be like so simple, uncomplicated and manageable. Thank you. | I have already paid for a checked bag but I don’t see it on my flight when I was checking in online. | When you have relatives outside USA that needs your attention flash, Spirit always have an option for me to choose and that’s priceless!!! | I tried several times to change my method from a previously selected payment method and it would not let me. Almost decided to book on different airlines for this reason. Not happy. | Or non US Citizens when asked for details like where are you staying in the US…. | I’m a Free Spirit and the app works for me! Much better than Frontier, I found out recently. The only issue I have is that the app doesn’t show prices for alternative dates when booking like the site does.

I’m not able to change cities and dates without beginning a brand new search.  This is a minor inconvenience…everything else is fine.  Also it would be if points and cash prices could be shown simultaneously.

Thank you Soirit! | My experience with this airline’s customer service was extremely disappointing. When I had to cancel a flight and book another one for the next day, the representative provided conflicting information about what fees I would incur. Despite my explicit inquiries, they failed to give me accurate quotes for upcoming flights and neglected to disclose all the associated charges. After I submitted payment, I discovered significant discrepancies in the charges, including unexpected fees for cancellation, phone assistance, and rebooking. Not only was I misled about the total cost, but I also realized I was charged for services I did not agree to or receive. This lack of transparency and poor communication left me feeling frustrated and deceived. I expect better service and honesty from an airline, and this experience fell far short of my expectations.",4.81186,1408425,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/4a/6a/aa/4a6aaae8-6fd6-0fa5-be70-082e64d36ff8/fa69651c-6efd-4f19-a7dc-fe48486a2a87_iOS_5.5_-_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/eb/a5/db/eba5db72-a25d-092a-c6f8-ba625581b3a6/f1f23663-4503-4e77-ac83-fe62bdda6984_iOS_5.5_-_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/3a/a7/92/3aa7927f-41a0-7a3d-2c74-33708e639110/5149fe9e-2279-4483-9ec4-43399ed269a7_iOS_5.5_-_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/b1/b2/bc/b1b2bc87-378a-66d6-44a4-893df26f5418/0453cb24-3a9c-4e43-b9a9-5432e9a8d163_iOS_5.5_-_4.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Their flights often show to be less money until you go to check in. This is where the charges begin.  I understand airlines have to make money but charging $4.39 for a can of soda and or a cup of coffee is beyond ridiculous. Plus the baggage checks and other things they expect you to purchase it is very easy to spend just as much or more money as you would with a different airline. 
Furthermore, the seats do not move or recline. I will say that the staff on the airplane were great. 
I have photos. I will be sending to their customer service department as well. Very first trip with a new suitcase and it has black marks and scuff marks all over it as well as being torn on one side in a hole punctured the other side. Not what I expected for the money that I spent. | So as usual, I selected to not pay for saving because we generally always end up setting together and per frontier policy. They say that they do everything they can to accommodate and seat the party together, which was clearly not the case because when I checked in this morning, they had me and my wife sitting at Rose apart yet I could choose to pay to sit next to her so the seat was open, so they literally force you to pay for seating which I think it’s pretty crooked considering the level of danger with flying I mean who would want to be sitting next to their wife as they fall into the ocean.

Would not update address, bday, known traveler #, etc.  Just so exasperating to navigate here!  Kicked me out or froze several times, would not pull info. Into screen for travel companions.  Just so very ridiculous.  I wish I had a better option to travel to Orlando from MI. | The only way you can check in with this airline is through their app, which does not find your flight, then sends you to an online chat that sends you to a new link to check in. However that link then gets hung up just before you get to the page where you get your boarding pass. Absolute garbage airline. Will never fly again. | So quick and easy | Hello
I found it quite frustrating booking today. Purchasing bags was confusing and I had to start over to correct the errors. It seems extra carryon bags kept being added to my total. I am familiar with booking tickets on line with other airline with much more ease.
Julianne Poland | Very easy to book. | It has been a good  and affordable price | Hi Frontier. I don’t want to be forced to download your poor-performing app for your poor-performing services. The only positive function you serve as a company, is keeping the competitor prices slightly more affordable as you slowly decline towards bankruptcy. Rest In Peril. | I love the app works very well i fly between my home in Maine to Florida and I haven’t had a bad flight yet … | Best airlines with best deals ever. | Avoid at all cost! Always late no gates … awwful! | Not being able to access your boarding pass defeats the purpose of having an app. | Have been very pleased with the service and selection of flights. | Love travel with Frontier, low rates and good services. | I have the newest iPhone, and the app can’t even open. Plus, I just bought a ticket a couple of hours ago, and Frontier didn’t send me my confirmation number. I reached out to consumer service, and I only heard crickets. It was a terrible first experience, and I will never buy again. | This is my first time using this app and is very responsive and intuitive, they do push to get bundles but I didn’t need them for this flight. Direct flights to my destination and back, yes please! | When I see an airline with good deals all the time, I want to fly with them. When they charge excessive duplicate rates for incidentals like baggage and seating it makes travel with the competitor more likely | This idiots wouldn’t let my kid’s school backpack through on the return flight even though it fit just fine flying in the night before. | I wish I could give 0 stars - accidentally booked an overweight bag, and couldn’t call any customer service agent because they’ve fired all their agents so they don’t even have a number anymore. Tried to resolve through the chat system and got the runaround, so when I got the airport I went to the desk and the agent “helped” and told me I’d see the refund in a few days - NEVER CAME. He basically pretended to refund me. So I filed a complaint to their email, got a response asking for my info and then they just never replied again for months of me following up for assistance. They’re SCAMMERS AND DESPERATE FOR EVERY PENNY I will never fly with them again and they don’t care about their customers at all | The flight was delayed 5 hours because of them when I arrived at my connection I had already missed it, they want to give me one for two days later in an unknown city and they don't even pay for the hotel or the food. | Just a terrible website | Your on line service is terrible tried cancelling one ticket due to medical emergency for myself only and you cancelled two tickets ! I wish there was a person we could talk to instead of “Bots”. If you want to look into this (but I doubt you will) it was for flight 1363 with confirmation JBV66M for Paul Young. This means I will not be using your airlines again, after your impersonal service. I can see how you are keeping your rates down by eliminating essential service. Shame on you and your airlines! | Great service. frontier has the best rates and nonstop flights | This happened today. I booked ticket with 1st checked bag fee together. And their limits is 40lbs. However. When I google it shows 41~50lbs for 1st checked bag. My first checked bag fee was $64 and my bag was 48 lbs. they charged me $100. Why not return $64?  Worst experience ever | Had to cancel a day earlier no refund policy is a ripoff should at least get half your money back!NEVER AGAIN! | Worse airline!! How do u ask client to pay $25 before checking them in? | Worst airline ever. | Website and customer service are horrible. I have a detailed issues with no person to talk to to resolve. | Since I joined Discount Den, when I chose the Den flight, my KTN will not populate not allows me to enter when I book thought app. Almost late for one of my flight cuz can’t get through PreCheck line. | Had some family stuff to take care of and I appreciate how I can get last-minute flights for good deals most of the time! And whenever I fly, every flight has had really great flight attendants! | Airline cancelled a flight couple hours before boarding and did not put us on a direct flight back or cover the expenses if we wanted to book with another airline. 
Also does not have a live customer agent we could talk to so we had to go to the airport when we had this issues. 
Anyways hate this airline but cheap.
It’s rated this low on trip advisor for a reason. | Good website but need apple pay as an option | I tried booking on the website with 4 different cards and 3 different computers. Booking was unsuccessful until I used the app, yet the payment went through with the same card. | I was trying to book & the app didn’t work and then when I closed & open it the price was different | No true communication and they want you to download what’s app to talk to them. Which I did and no one spoke to me for help. Only an email work and all I was asking was can I add 1 more family one my family vacation. They said to buy a separen ticket?!?! Wow | Only reason I’m flying with you is because it’s a direct flight and I’m in a hurry. You nickel dime everybody and I am not very happy with your service. Plus when I cancel the flight for emergency, you had agent had promised to refund me and you never did. Your agent told me that they would reimburse me on American Express. Which was a lie  So I don’t trust your airline and you nickel dime everything you do. Your website is very tricky to make you overpay every time you click a button. Plus, your bundle packages are also deceiving. Only way you get a better review is if you ever refund me the $530 I spent for a return trip that never refunded or reschedule | I’m relocating and Frontier has been the best thing since sliced bread to get me to and from. In a timely manner. | The lack of customer service is insane.  If you cancel a flight and receive a voucher the credit is not immediately applied to your profile in the app.  You have to wait a week or more for an email with a 16 digit voucher code.  Meanwhile, any thought of using that voucher to rebook a flight immediately is gone. | They write a time when flight leaves on ticket ? But close 15 minutes early ?
Maybe should be considerate and write the 15 minute early time on the ticket cause that is what it actually is, missing a flight for being sent false information does not make you a 5 star business | the worst airline I have ever flown with. Spirit was better than this. the employees in the airport right before boarding the flight are extremely unprofessional and rude. I even saw how rude they were when servicing other passengers on the flight. The airline has all theses extra fees and unnecessary charges. You think you are getting a deal but buy the time you purchase your ticket and everything else you could have just purchased through a better airline. I booked two flights through frontier and one flight has been changed 3 times ruining all the plans I set accordingly. Although I can say the flight was smooth and how frontier did have a woman during check in when departing from home in Dallas who was very kind. I wish I would have gotten her name. Other than that I feel the service needs a lot of work and the extra fees should be up front. 2 stars only because of the plan crew and that nice lady at check in although I still would not recommend. | What sort of data piracy is this? | FRONTIER IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!!! | While I enjoy direct flights from RSW to ISP, it is extremely difficult to do business with Frontier if you need to contact them. Two plus hours on the phone! Time is money! | Trying to hard to sell extras. Got stuck trying to get past “bundles” page because the two options when on that page just took me back to all the options. The option to decline had 95% of the button hidden so I didn’t even realize it was what I wanted to click. | It is extremely hard to book a flight and to get questions answered. I really wish you had people that we could actually talk to on the phone. Chatting just doesn’t do it. | Es la peor aerolínea que hay en el mercado, son súper malos, qué malo que no le puedo dar 0 estrella, no la recomiendo | Was difficult to opt out of the bundling. All else is relatively easy. | Wow unbelievable prices | Love the airport and proximity to my home. However:  1. Website is terrible, 2. NO customer service at all, 3. Lost suitcase going from Trenton to Palm Beach (NEVER LOCATED), 4. If you have any questions, the response from the Chat, doesn’t help, 5. If you’d like to talk with someone, it costs $40.00, 6. If there’s bad weather or the plane is delayed or cancelled, it takes days to get a new flight.",4.67188,827103,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/13/06/91/13069113-018c-3bfd-1d9f-fca66a8254fd/703c2def-5fa5-4097-8f78-d39ace14a173_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-02_at_15.17.40.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/a3/d2/34/a3d234c0-1912-1c46-9e46-c6a77630bc3f/187b1a00-06e5-4d4a-b73d-1cef243445b7_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-01_at_11.15.01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/95/0f/aa/950faab3-e9af-f65b-7bd7-0c390335b476/f7a8da08-e7cf-4393-bb07-6071235a91e8_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-01_at_11.15.05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/8f/b8/31/8fb831fc-3148-0fe6-7f46-04723927546f/c917a3ab-3a9e-4940-9a41-04a9194092ed_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-02_at_15.18.33.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/23/be/e0/23bee021-3dfa-d604-fd36-b33416c021c8/64c81ac1-e8a9-4c8a-bcc1-f9a839466dd6_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-01_at_11.15.07.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/af/44/70/af4470bc-7f0b-b3f0-c7e2-bbcace3bc15e/53c4096b-e889-4f8c-9f8e-9d1aaa710b3c_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-01_at_11.15.19.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e3/f4/a3/e3f4a3a9-3d76-ff20-a2ed-562405a207e9/1bfca2e7-8cf8-47df-8a2b-45a07776ab38_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-01_at_11.15.27.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d5/01/a6/d501a62b-518a-a6ad-338e-a4d31541cb93/fc53ac8e-c01a-477b-9a9e-b872fa9170f6_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-02_at_15.19.18.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/9a/ed/75/9aed754d-9047-5067-053a-8c90a8802b83/8997e71e-6cb9-4068-9a41-bb82167743fd_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-06-01_at_11.15.42.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/2e/d1/98/2ed19855-779d-50d4-7d9f-f464c75f8c6d/39e64be7-4f43-4abc-b591-73207138a7f9_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.27.49.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/16/08/1f/16081f58-afc6-bc7b-843e-f0bf28625335/09195774-e7fc-409f-a1b4-db3aec6e8d2d_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.32.55.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3b/02/ee/3b02ee32-96d1-913c-f26b-b176de23e78b/8dd4d6ee-d761-42d4-bc56-1534a9c0093c_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.32.51.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/cb/4c/29/cb4c2946-3e9e-cfc5-eaf3-522773eb875e/4379e031-f094-41f5-a027-61d7d22cff61_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.32.12.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/88/d2/fa/88d2fa7c-493b-c608-b5f8-4c80768ef051/d1492d63-d3e5-4b7d-810c-277a45284af5_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.30.08.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1e/b7/01/1eb701d7-0f21-3f87-ff3e-5c27ef949d56/e120346a-d9f0-421e-8c15-0ff46f29d893_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.36.57.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7f/ba/06/7fba066f-f622-389b-a55e-f1cf0e223418/e01a77fe-cabb-4fdb-ab0c-ffefac86d190_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.32.16.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/03/ca/5a/03ca5a0f-49d1-5a59-74b0-0b3309bb9e3f/90bb2b4d-d7f9-4f06-b4ac-ce4d3e963525_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.32.19.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/e5/eb/ec/e5ebecfc-176b-7c22-ebc4-6598507759dc/e8c3106a-d4bd-44da-a02a-bf525783dc88_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00286th_generation_U0029_-_2023-06-02_at_15.32.37.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellul

Just bad design and especially poor usability design.  It could use apply pay. It could have a great login flow.  Easy vehicle selection. But no… | They wrongfully forget your license plate every time. They intentionally refuse to let you use Apple Pay. They never let you add any cards manually as it just throws errors. 1000% unacceptable. Expect a lawsuit for you and any politician who attempts to enslave their constituents with such malicious software. Shame on your existence. | I paid for parking but I received a ticket. And when I contacted ParkMobile, they left my high and dry and told me to contact the authorities that gave me the ticket since they have nothing to do with it. So now I paid ParkMobile and I have to pay a parking ticket because the town doesn’t account for my license plate in the ParkMobile database. Hmmm. Seems weird that I paid a fee to ParkMobile but they never forwarded my fee to the town. Fraud? It may be. Hmmm… | Saves a lot of time | The new update kicks me out of my account and won’t let me sign in.  Now that it’s send a link to the email. And it doesn’t ever send | Tried to park at work today since they closed the free lot. No payment kiosk in the lot so was forced to use the app. I had my old credit cards on the app and tried to add my new one. The only options available to me were to add paypal, which I don’t have, or to preload a minimum of $25. I could not even edit my previous card information or remove them as all that changed was the expiration and CVC when I got a new one. Horrible user experience. | Once we learned how to use the app, it made things very convenient. it’s nice having the receipt show up in my email. | Updated review: after reviewing our receipt, I’ve figured out what happened. There were two UX failures:

1. Due to a lack of clear signage, I paid for parking on a Saturday. Turns out weekend parking was free in that zone, but the app did not indicate that anywhere. It gladly took my money - and set my parking expiration time to the time when paid parking starts on Monday plus the duration I paid for. 

2. The Live Activity immediately began counting down the duration I paid for. However, the main page of the app showed the Monday morning expiration. So, the Live Activities are bugged: they are setting the countdown based on the duration chosen rather than the expiration time, even though there are cases like above where the expiration time may not be “right now + duration”.

Really the bigger fail is #1 though. The app should indicate when parking is free and recommend against paying. That was the whole reason I paid through the app in the first place: no clear signage around, so I had hoped it would indicate the schedule, but it didn’t. | This app is unusable. I reloaded the app and tried to park today. Won’t take my password and never sent a link. I had to spend a few xtra $$ and park in a garage, which I don’t like to do. Fix this p0c app! | When I found a spot, I found parking number and setup time, done. If want to do extend, just put time and pay. | this is the best app i have ever used. it works so smoothly and so clearly. do not change a single part of it. i love it just the way it is | What kind of an app loses all your stored information when it forces you to update? This is truly done of the worst programming I have ever seen! | App has intrusive notifications advertising themselves. Please stop! | What concevable reason is there for pausing my music? There aren’t even any audio cues. | Login with email does not work. No code sent. Have to contact help for them to tell me to enter my phone number in email field to get in. And not possible to change default pay. Yet we’re required to use this app to use public transportation. How many barriers would you like to throw? The help (after 1000% useless help bot) was effective, but took effort and time.  get it together guys | Love the app - it’s easy to use and replenish when needed - great for the beach I never have to go back to feed the meter just set a timer to replenish | Recently tried to use this app for parking in Florida, it wouldn’t allow me to pay. I tried adding a new card, tried using Apple pay, tried restarting the app, etc. After many, many attempts I gave up. Went back to the car and I had a ticket. Reached out to support and they were unhelpful and seemingly didn’t understand what I was trying to tell them about what happened. Ugh, very frustrating and expensive experience with this app and customer service. | This app is terrible. It is so frustrating that you need so many different parking apps. To be able to reset your password is so incredibly frustrating. It doesn’t work. Unfortunately, if you want to park in a particular spot, you need the app. So why would a city or town bother spending money on an app that works. | Should be able to transfer unused time  to another parking are | Found a parking place and parked last night. It would only let me pay for the amount of time left before free parking. Woke up this morning. Renewed my parking. It keeps track of the amount of time you have left for you. Probably haven’t even found out everything it does at this point. Keeps your credit card on file. Keep your numerous cards on file so you don’t have to go around re-entering everything. | Sending a login link via email is one of the least secure methods for logging into a site. Do you know how easy it is to execute a man-in-the-middle attack with that method?!  No respectable site or app does this. Please rethink that requirement. | Screw every designer of this app. It’s like you hate anyone who wants to search or navigate. This app is garbage | The genius who made the decision to not enable log in via password, has never found themselves in a parking lot with the app the only available method of payment, only to find out you’ve been logged out and the only way back in is via email that never comes!  How about changing that!!! | I think this was one of the best things that happened. The parking space is very low cost and you don’t have to worry about paying expensive parking tickets. Thank You. | Love the convenience, certainly beats putting change in a meter. One thing I’d like to see added, that would be a very helpful feature, is the ability to zoom in and have better resolution of what zones cover what streets. currently this isn’t that accurate, and you can accidentally get the wrong zone identified for the location you’re car is currently at. | Come on man.   Would be so easy to check out using Apple Pay.   Rather than dig out a credit card it is tempting just to walk away if my visit is short. | App incorporates Nift adware | It’s everywhere now, it’s convenient. It stores the places I frequent. It’s just so much easier then searching or holding into coins to pay the meter.  One good thing, I never knew that the first hour is free who knew. I love it, I give it a 10 | I have been using this app for years and it only gets worse. Zero customer service. | Best app invented no more tickets ever put your vehicle information in an press 2 buttons walah | I live in Dallas and parking is horrible! I ONLY look for the big green sign with the parking numbers! It’s affordable and convenient. I’ll walk a little to park cheap. PLEASE never change your prices!!! Lol | It glitches. I parked the car and paid for it. Then i went to check if i need to extend or not. App didnt show, and i said ok book for another time and paid. Openned app again and i see i have 2 time slots with different time of remaining. What a ripoff? Test your app, and fix bugs. This is ridiculous | I pay 25 cents for 30 minutes in the app is 80 cents it’s too much money | I rate this 5 stars because downtown in my city I got used to inputting coins and ever since I downloaded this app and used this new mobile app it’s been way easier and fast to purchase time for parking. When I’m far away from my parking spot I can add more time from a click of a button on my phone, no need to grab dirty coins or walk all the way back to add more time. Best app I ever used for parking meters. I really hope they add them to more cities! | I found this app while on vacation in a busy location, and it was convenient and easy to use. Unfortunately, there’s no option in the App for cancellation of service and charges. You need to open a help ticket and send a few emails. Annoying and inconvenient. I also had to block them with my banking institution. | Could be more intuitive, but very easy to use didn’t know how to enter the parking spot number at first but I figured it out. Also would be nice if they had more directions on when parking expired and how long you park

Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. 

Many online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.

Ditch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app.

I will pronounce the words perfectly and it says I’m saying them wrong. It’s trash! | Enjoying the challenge. | Lo mejor que he visto y wooww | I am two weeks in. This app is perfect! It helps me with different lessons and it was worth it’s price. I love it. Would DEFINITELY recommend | My husband and I are relocating to Europe and I am trying to learn a couple of languages, until Rosetta I didn’t really find it sticking. I am new at it but so far I am really impressed. I have tried a lot of other YouTube and other forms to learn the language, like driving with tapes, etc., etc. and none of them have been helpful up till now. | Excellent way to quickly learn Spanish. Only drawback is I wish they had a driving mode that I could use during my 1 hour daily commute each way. You can’t use this app while driving, which is why I bought it (learn Spanish during my 2 hour daily commute time). | I’ve been learning Spanish to travel and I’m putting it to the test. I’ve traveled to 2 Spanish speaking countries and am getting better! Do the lessons and don’t be afraid to use what you have when you can! Practicing with fluent Spanish speakers is so helpful. I’ve enjoyed my time with RS! Thank you! | I love it is easy to learn | The developer has been saying for literal years that they are working on a fix, yet nothing ever materializes. I have tried with and without headphones and the app cannot understand me under any circumstance. Genuinely useless app as a result. | That is the only thing stopping a five star rating 4 me | This program teaches you step by step. It’s not only educational, it’s fun. Just follow each step. It might seem overwhelming at first but suddenly… it just clicks and you’ll find you’ve learned more than you thought. Enjoy! | App is garbage. Difficult to use. Difficult to restart a lesson or go back. Need to be in near silence for it to respond to verbal responses. Grading/responses seem random. I’ll have ones where I deliberately messed up and got full marks. Ones where I felt pretty close and get low marks. This app is no good. On web it’s pretty solid. | The best app for learning a new language fun fast and easy | Es una aplicación increíble!!! gracias a esta he podido aprender francés y mejorar mi pronunciación a pesar de ser gratuita. La recomiendo mucho✔️✨❤️ | Love it! Makes learning fun | Is helping with my German | I’m a huge language nerd and have been studying with Rosetta Stone for a few weeks now. It’s a certain kind of learning style, one that is considered the most effective: emersion. There is no literal English translation, only pictures to explain what a certain word or phrase means. This is how infants and young children learn their first language, and is the scientifically proven best way to learn a new language. So if you want to learn quickly in the way that will stick best in your brain, I would download Rosetta Stone. I’ve also tried out other language apps, such as Duolingo, which is good, but doesn’t teach the language in full (depending on the language). But I would highly suggest Rosetta Stone. The only thing I would say is that the emersion process is really fast! I would just slow down the course a little to let the words and grammar sink in better. But other than that, it’s amazing. Thank y’all so much!❤️ | Using Rosetta Stone in addition to living in a Spanish speaking culture and taking in person lessons.  It’s a great help | Why do you have to pay !!!!!!!!!!!!! | I honestly love this app it can teach you almost any language. I rate this infinity out of 10. | I like the use of a lot of similar pictures for learning. | It works! Its fast! Its easy! | This is just SO good first it has lots of content and corses but duo is better still but no heat :P | I love Rosetta Stone and I love to learn Italian. | I was born in Costa Rica and when we travel there, I want my children to be able to speak to their relatives. This app is helping a lot. The only thing is that the microphone connection is poor. But other than that, this app is a lot of help.

                              Thank you! | Amazing app, I was learning Japanese on Duolingo and got nowhere. But now I’m using Rosetta Stone and can speak to my parents in Japanese , not like they understand it, this app is actually incredible. | I’m an intermediate Spanish speaker and Rosetta Stone is a better app experience than the other popular apps, which I’ve tried. I also think the content and structure of Rosetta Stone are better. | The speech recognition is very shaky. Sometimes- it works just fine. Right now, I’m trying to complete lessons for a college class and I can’t complete the lesson because of poor quality. I’ve tried using headphones on the computer, with my phone, with my computer microphone, and with my phones microphone. No matter what I do the 10 minute speaking lesson is taking 20+ minutes. Aside from speech recognition the app and website are great. | Rosetta Stone has made learning Italian so easy and fun! Lessons are quick and combine pictures for easy learning. | I love how it shows pictures without a translation. Feeling like a newborn figuring it out on my own. | Thank you thank you for helping kids that speak different languages learn new ones yes, so fun learning Portuguese | I have always wanted to learn Italian. I studied it as a child and got to an intermediate level. Now as an adult, I wanted to improve my speaking and after several attempts with other apps throughout the years, I didn’t feel any improvement. I have been learning with Rosetta Stone at the intermediate level for 4 weeks and I have learn so much! I feel that the sentences stay in my memory and  I don’t need to stop and think how to say this or that because phrases just come out of my mouth! Plus it is so much fun!! | Learning so much. The best place to learn! | For a very long time I’ve said I want to become fluent in another language. I’m so glad that I don’t have to be limited to only English anymore. This is only the beginning. | I like it and i know to say girl in Japanese | Listening randomly stops working so cannot get pronunciation unit complete | It doesn’t translate to you. So off of pictures you have to figure out what is being said. There’s no way you can learn that way. | Love this one | My microphone has 0 issues with anything other than Rosetta Stone. 

I have a 12 pro max and am yelling Spanish at the phone and it’s not picking it up. It acts like it can’t hear me. It’s extremely frustrating. | I am really enjoying learning Italian with this app, I would recommend this to people who would like to learn another language. | The instructions are so confusing. The app won’t advance if you can’t figure out the instructions to one part! The microphone doesn’t record.  I had to scream my replied into the microphone. I am out 199 and very disappointed! | I very much enjoy learning español with this program. I like that it jumps right into the lesson with pictures. I didn’t realize how much I was absorbing until like my 3rd day. I was like wow, I’m really starting to put small sentences together. The only thing that bothers me is the mic. I have a iPhone 14 Pro Max and the room is completely quiet but the app constantly says my mic is having poor connection and that get kind of frustrating. But other than that I love it. | Unbelievable waste of money, no explanations of concepts or vocabulary whatsoever. How can you learn a language without simple vocabulary or grammar in the lessons? | I just love how fast that I am learning! | I am trying to learn Turkish because my family speaks and I have learned so much in the past week I am speaking full dented already you don’t have to pay anything you just get the app and get started. There are many languages including a planner, timing and it even has a choice for you to speak into the mic or choose cards. This has helped me so much a fan now my mom is so proud of me and is now considering sending me to turkey to my family!!!! Thank you so much whoever created this app you have made my life so much easier and my experience with this app is just so good I could go on and on all day saying good things about this app. Also fun fact I’ve been using this app since I was 8 and I am way older now but I have stopped for a while Becuase I got bored but now that I am older I can’t wait to speak Turkish to family and I am so happy teşekkürler!! It means thank you in Turkish! 😉 | I signed up to learn French after a year of using DuoLingo. With Rosetta, I signed up as a complete beginner. Sheesh, it’s a good thing I had already been learning for a year now because their beginner course is not beginner at all. They jump right in with no explanation of anything. If I didn’t already have a little backround, I would be so lost. At least with DuoLing, they explains grammar structure as you learn it. So far, Rosetta does not. Not a fan so far but I’ll continue using here and there to see if I like it. Thankfully, I have a free membership through work or else this first impression would absolutely run me off. | They kinda just throw you right in but I enjoy it I’m also quick to get frustrated but it takes time can’t learn overnight but overall it’s great and I’m kinda hooked | I haves used Duolingo for two years. It’s not perfect, but ok. Tried Rosetta Stone. Lessons are worthless. No help no explanations - fail over and over again until it decides you pass.

I don’t remember the last flight I had with Alaska where my flight was not cancelled and seats downgraded but I was still charged more money. | For clarity I fly Alaskan Airlines because I live in Alaska and you have the best flight schedule. Delta is by far the best American airline. I take Delta every chance I get. Alaska Airlines recently went to a no paper ticket boarding pass system. I do not like it. To be honest how do you expect elderly passengers to travel??? Or how about people with disabilities??? Or people that recognize that these digital devices are addictive and who want to go back to a flip phone? The new boarding pass system is not welcomed by all. | Why did it say to see a gate agent when I checked in when I picked my seat when I booked it then after I checked in it gave me the seat very confusing | Why save a credit card if your app continues to remove ot and make you add it every time - also it’s 2024 - start using Apple Pay! | The crew were so attentive to passengers needs, and the flight was smooth.
I like the head rests and small shelf to hold cell phones while charging.

At the top of my list to fly on ALASKA.
🙌 Danielle | Muy buen servicio y fácil documentación | I go to the app and there is no gate number.   No boarding time.   This app need more info | Went through the full booking and then the transaction failed on your end. Had to start over and my guess is the app thought the seats i selected during the failed transaction were taken. doubtful in the 3 min it took to go through the process again. | It is annoying that we are not able to add boarding pass to wallet | The apple wallet feature doesn’t work. It is not possible to add separe add for each person in the group. | Very pleased with the thoughtfulness and professionalism of staff and app usage and will highly recommend to friends and family in the future.  I look forward to future trips with Alaska Airlines. Thank you! | Not everyone can navigate today’s computerized world. A few of us were born in the late 1900’s. Several tries to set up had me frustrated. | Need to improve app | Your app was extremely easy to follow and do. Thank you for such good service ‼️🤙🏽😃 | The app doesn’t allow me to input my mileage number. | The Alaska website is very easy to use and it’s also very competent in that you can do all the things you need to do to schedule, purchase, and change travel plans. | App won’t allow me to add boarding pass to wallet. 😣 | Alaska Air app is easy to use, responsive and accessible. All I need for travel at my fingertips. | The best yet | If I have a flight first book the first thing that should show up on my app is the flight information.

If I have multiple flights, the first thing that should show on my screen is all my flights booked in the future-  all future flights. 

Connecting to the WiFi is not simple and unclear how to buy it prior to the flight.  The app is below average | Won’t let me sign in to my account or reset my password. The link it sends to me when I reset my password is an endless loop to the same link. Complete garbage | This airline is so great and then something goes wrong and it’s an hour or more to get someone on the phone. The message says we’ll call you back. So you don’t have to wait. Still waiting after multiple attempts to get a callback! That’s a drag. Work keeps me very busy and this extra time eats into what little free time I have. | While flying out of Orlando to Seattle I made an error on checking in bags.  I had three free bags and accidentally put the extra three on one ticket.  Which cost 345 when I went to customer service to fix they told me that well now I know better the. They charged me for a seventh bag that I didn’t have.  I then called customer service and asked for them to help and was told they couldn’t help me until I arrived in Seattle..  I called again and asked that the charges be changed and that I should only be charged 135.  I was rebated the 45 for the bag I didn’t have but I guess Alaska Air is so bad off that doing right by a long time customer and card holder wasn’t worth it. So much for customer service and support | Add passes to Apple Wallet broken and requires deleting and reinstalling the app | So easy to use and understand! | It works as well as your door plugs | Unable to pay for bags on the website. | Crew did not check that all electrical units working on plane until everyone is loaded  and ready to go they realized, so they gave us sit in a hot plane for over an hour then make us get off.. | The last couple times I flew I cannot get my TSA on my boarding pass. I am still in the process of trying to get that done on the computer. | Usually a solid app, but lately add to wallet is broken | Is it time to check in for my flight yet? I don’t know because the Trips view doesn’t show my trips and I have to force-quit the app and swipe down to force it to reload.

When it’s past time to check in the flight page doesn’t give me the option. Even when I have a message saying it’s time. Even when I’ve force-quit the app.

Oh, my partner checked me in, but Alaska didn’t pull my Known Traveller Number from my profile so I don’t have TSA Pre-Check.

After several more attempts I can finally re-check myself in and have a TSA Pre-Check boarding pass, but I can’t add it to Wallet. No amount of force-quit fixes this, but I can share the boarding pass into a new message and load the boarding pass into Wallet that way. | I took so long to pack my bags I barely made my flight. | Using this app made me feel more secure that everything was fine with my reservation to go home. Paid for meals & luggage as well. | Not intuitive, have to go online / web browser to access discount codes, other features, cant use hyphen in last names, authenticator doesnt work all the time perfectly, customer service isnt good. | No other airline I’ve flown requires me to download their app to check in. Not a great customer experience. | No stop overs. Pleasant flight attendants.
No delays too! Thank you! | Last two trips will not load into apple wallet. | We find that service is always the best, flights are on time and planes clean and comfortable! | do you benchmark against any of your competitors? | I’m in my 60s and not thrilled to need an app to do what I for so long did competently without a cell phone. Still, if I have to be enslaved by technology, at least it’s easy to use and pretty self explanatory. | Very disappointed that I paid for a lounge plus membership in January 2024,  and now it is not showing in the Alaska App and I can’t access the lounge on my trip. | I want to thank Judy from Boise for helping me book a flight to attend my father’s funeral. Dad dies yesterday and the funeral is on May 2, 2024. 

I was having difficulty finding something affordable but Judy helped me use my frequent flyer miles. She was very kind and that took one burden from my shoulders. 

It’s a wonderful company that hires such caring employees. 

Mariane Heisler | I like flying Alaska Airlines. Don’t get my wrong. I love their points system and most of the time they are on time. However, I have not seen any significant improvements or updates to the app since I started flying with Alaska Airlines in 2012. It uses the same analogy date system instead of making it digitized so you can easily scroll up and down to select travel dates. Instead you have to click for each month.  The app does not save your recent searched cities to make it easy when booking flights. You cannot switch between cities using a simple arrow when comparing departure and return flights. Adding boarding passes to Apple wallet should be one click instead of having to add multiple passes or connecting flights individually. I will be happy to see new changes to this app at least once in a while not the same app over a decade. Developers of this app need to take a look at other airlines apps and also keep up with technology. | Love Alaska Airlines! | I love the interface and information presented. However, after checking in, I was not able to add my e-tickets for myself and my partner in Apple Wallet. Tried following instructions using different internet connection on iPhone but nothing worked. 

Please conduct usability/back end testing to fix this problem. Thx, Trevor | I can’t get a seat assignment.

But there is one thing I would change: the talking. It is so long and it should just play a video. Everything else is awesome 😎 | The previews of this game are nothing like what the game actually is.
Still a good time passer though | I HATE THAT THEY TOOK AWAY THE DAILY ENERGY CHEST.
This makes the game less playable without spending money. 

So they have fixed the game enough that it hasn’t crashed my iPod in quite a while. My only complaint is that it’s gambling. You can pay real money for energy and there is no guarantee that you will get the item you need. You could spend $100 and have zero guarantee that you will be able to get the item. Because it’s “random” they will say. I think that when you need an item it’s rigged to give out that item less. Like when I don’t need tea cups I get tons of them but when I actually need tea cups to make a jug I can spend over 100 energy and not be able to complete a jug. ,for that reason. I never spend money on this app. | I really enjoy the graphics. The color choices are fun. But why? Why ruin this pleasant game with divorce… homelessness… “help me” storyline. Ugh! Cringe! | At first I thought its a useless game because there is no option to get energy by playing tasks or other games but now this is my favourite game because you don’t have to give so much time to play!! It doesn’t waste too much time. Different but interesting!! | Was super fun at first and I liked the story, however, as many other reviews have mentioned, the recharge time for energy is abysmal. Can only play for 10-15 minutes. And with the higher level requests? Might take days to fulfill. | I have been over charged three times for a bundle that is supposed to be $4.99 and I was charged $14.99 each time. 

I am having a difficult time contacting for refunds. | Game is too expensive. It gets to the point where you can’t complete orders for DAYS unless you buy the expensive energy/gem packs. It was really fun at first but without unlimited money, you can only get so far🙁 | Wish we could okay continuously and didn’t have to use energy takes away from the game | Basically is not how it shows in the advertisement and I hate it. This is the worst game I’ve ever played. | I downloaded this game because of the ads. But it’s nothing like the ads. IT IS SO MUCH BETTER!!! The storyline is carefully created, and the characters are very diverse. Sure, there’s ads, but not much. I played for 20 min today without an ad! And here’s a tip: when you receive reward boxes with energy bottles, merge them! Download this game now! | The only problem is really hard to get more  energy to be able to play but other than that it’s funn and not alot of advertisements and even if you want to watch ads they will get you  some prizes !! | Buen juego | Don’t waste your time | This game is so fun and kid friendly you learn while playing this game! I love playing this game! | not like the ads they have for it or the pictures she show in the app store. completely different game | So yeah. Free Ipad game, and it’s not boring or irritating. Gameplay is simple enough, just match the pictures and satisfy the customers. The story’s a bit ridiculous, but I find there’s kind of a charm to that.

Been pretty enjoyable so far. | It’s not what was advertised with the child and mom stuck in the cold. | Found this game through an ad. Game is nothing like the ad. You get minimal playing time because you pretty much need to make recipes in order to level up. You can’t make recipes without lightning. This game needs a lot of work. I’m sorry but I’m not paying to play an app. Recipes require too many steps. | One of the ads this game runs shows safe haven boxes with the label “xxx-xxbabyxx”!! | Generally if you ignore the story the game is ok to play.  Many of the items don’t take too long to merge to reach (for example Love and Pies which takes ages to merge orders). It barely gets three stars because if the storyline.  It is awful, if you fast forward through it then it is passably bearable. | Not what it shows. Just making a great restaurant and things. The ad shows that they are homeless, parched, and hungry! NOT WHAT IT SHOWS, DO NOT GET THIS GAME. Did 5 stars for it to put it on the front. | This game is the best you get to do everything that was in the ad your going to love it thinking of downloading it you definitely should | This game is fun but it’s NOTHING like the ads!and there is WAY TO MUCH DRAMA so thanks,but NO | This is a fun game. Enjoyed the real life story line. People will identify with the characters or know someone who is like them | The game play is completely different than what the ad shows you. | I loved this game. I’d even spend money on it occasionally. Then I started noticing charges on my card I didn’t approve. Somehow these purchases were going through while I was sleep and never popped up on my side at all. Only saw the charges left. The rewards from the purchase wouldn’t be on the app either so idk where the money was going. I finally decided to just delete the game and report it to Apple | POTATO LIGHTBULB WITH A GUINEA PIG JUDGE. And we call that an attention-getter, kids. Now on to the review! 

This game is incredibley enjoyable and intriguing. The merge game is relaxing and fun and the story had me hooked from the start. It's almost like reading fan fiction (not sure why I think that; I just do). 

The graphics are GORGEOUS and there are SO MANY AREAS to unlock in the restaurant, I'm very excited to do so. 

You'll see reviews saying that you can't play for a long time because you run out of energy, which is true. I kind of like that as it moderates my screen time. Also it's free and there's no ads unless you willingly watch one for a prize so I see no reason to complain. 

The only thing negative I have to say (and not even really negative at that) is there are some more adult themes and also some LGBTQIA+ tones which I personally am not a fan of. But to each his own, I'm very satisfied with this game. 

Thank for taking the time to read and if you're considering downloading this game, let this be your sign to do so. 

🥔💡🐹👩‍⚖️ | It is meh . The preview is completely from what the actual game is. Sigh 😔 | I need 5 hours of my life back Gossip Habor. Takes too long or too much money to make real progress. Reclaiming my time | This is a really good game the graphics are great but you run out of energy really fast and watch to many ads but anyways a really great game pls download | This game was really fun to begin with but quickly you have to pay money to keep playing. You can maybe play five minutes before running out of lighting bolts that are needed and they take forever to refill. There are very few extra ways to win more lighting bolts, gems etc. like other games. The concept of the game is fun but not rewarding enough to continue to keep playing without spending money. | As of right now, I’m playing the game but it’s not even close to what was advised. At least I don’t see it that way. | It’s so relatable ✌🏼 | The mystery to solve should be who’s is jacking your hard mundane earned inventory as it seemly disappears when you exit the app pretty frequently.  Next up is you serve a customer and watch your coin count increase nada any.  Furthermor.. this wasn’t presented  in an accurate dipection of what the game is all about (very misleading) and overall pretty lame the dishonesty  built in makes it a HARD NO .. don’t waste your time ! | Taking a long time to get started in the game hard to follow what to do next and why. | The ad I saw was nothing like the actual game. The game is really good, but nothing like the ad. | I absolutely hate that she never changes outfits as it would
Be more interesting to see some clothing changes when we pop on day after day.  Cole’s outfits have changed but not hers and the shorts and T-shirt wear on you | I play every single day and I absolutely love this game! Definitely 5 stars! | You only play for like 5 minutes then you’re out of energy for a couple hours unless you spend lots and lots of real money for packages. And the first 5 preview slides are nothing like the real game. | Read the recent reviews.  Nothing like advertised. Just another another scam to get you to spend money when you’re bored. Stay away. Definitely a false rating on apple | But it actually exceeded my expectations and i love to play this game whenever i’m relaxing 🙂 and there isn’t annoying ads in the game

(I was hesitant cuz i wasn’t sure if the ads reflected the actual game play, and it’s pretty close. The ads themselves are good marketing cuz it made me download the game 😂) | This game is horrible. It wasn’t like the advertisement at all. And it’s basically just a copy of other games just like this. I wasted my time even downloading this. 0 STARS! | Do not believe the ads for this game. The actual game play is not at all like the ad. Not even close. Not even a little bit.  Why do they create ads that are completely different than the actual game? I deleted the game after realizing your false advertisement. That was about five minutes. Do you get paid for downloads? Is that why you lie on your ads? Not sure what the point of false advertising but there must be some benefit to lying in your ads | These are such depressing subjects on which to base a game that is likely focused for younger people. Aren’t there any positive reasons to program in this “game” rather than sadness and desperation?  I’d have to stop playing online games if this is how they all are. | I love this game because there is gossip and drama. | I was looking for a game to relax at night, and when I found this one I first I liked it.  But is frustrating that the Energy runs so fast, there is not enough time to complete the orders, even with the energy you can not do anything because they recharge in the middle of filling the orders

Alice as a child, she heard stories about adventures in Wonderland. Yet, she journeyed through time to a Fairyland she dreamed of. As Alice navigated Wonderland, she encountered residents and resolved their issues. Over time, Alice has come to know the truth about Wonderland's destruction.

What will she do when she encounters bizarre situations and new challenges?

Features
A vast worldview
The scenery ranges from fresh fields and mysterious woods to a royal palace. During Alice's adventures, players will see classic scenes from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

Delicate scenes
Speaking plants, giant mushrooms like wise men... The classic scenes have been redesigned and presented to the players in a brand-new way.

Merge and scene repair
Each item player merged can be used to repair scenes with the storyline of Wonderland's destruction and rebuilding. By merging items to a higher level, players gradually restore Wonderland to its former glory.

Order System and Magic Cuisine
The residents will provide Alice with magic cuisines as a thank-you gift for rebuilding their home. Besides being delicious, the cuisine has magical effects. According to original stories, Alice shrank to her original calf size after drinking liquid marked ""DRINK ME."". A bite of bread could also cause her to grow as large as Mr. White Rabbit's house. Other effects require you to explore!

Nevertheless it’s fun | This game is so much fun to play! It is really easy to learn how to play and it is such a great way to relax! I love playing the game after a stressful day at work it always helps me relax!! Love it! | Really cool | Why you have to pay to unlock :( | Fun game | So far it’s more than just a puzzle game. I prefer puzzles to building | 好玩 | This game is so addicting | Like it so far but just started it today so I really don’t have time to know how much I like it yet | 🎉🎉🎉🎉 | 💕 | Yess | Very fun and entertaining. Simple but a lot of fun. Unlocking the next challenges | If you’re looking for the game to be mostly releasing the rings, this isn’t it. The rings are just a very small part. It’s got some matching, some gathering, and it’s all over the place. It’s so chaotic it’s hard to enjoy. | But real cute and keeps my attention through my adhd crashes | Thank you for making this game I love it.😇 | Have the character’s chat able to be skipped.  Some people don’t want to have to read all the chats. | Great graphics and endless fun for all ages | Nice | The cutest merge game ever 🥹🥹🥹🥹 the cute little baby tinker bell and everything about Alice in Wonderland 🥹🥰 soooo cute | I enjoy the game but it seems unless I purchase items I have to wait to play longer. Maybe if there are more free things to do. | I wanted to enjoy this game, but I had to keep dealing with the story. And that is why I am no longer playing it. | Try it! | It is a great theme with Alice in Wonderland and it involves clicking lots of things to make other things to make stuff work and open up new areas of things. | Muy adictiva la cosa | The game is fine, but I find the advertising offensive as it depicts domestic violence toward women. | So fun | You don’t have to spend a lot of money to play the game | Too Much going on on the screen you have about five different areas where you can purchase things you earn all these coins, but there’s nowhere to spend these coins you, you have to buy everything with cash. Im going to play for about another 15 minutes and then I’m gonna delete the app if all it keeps wanting me to buy bye-bye, you should be able to earn what you need | Same little mini games that last 2 day are to large to complete . Everything repeats itself (mini games as well as the other mini games . I had this game for over a year and I still can’t get enough of anything to do anything in fairytale island it’s always the same animals. I have played repeatedly mini game to the point I don’t even do them because it will be gone in a day or two . Give more do less please. | Fun so far! | Love it | While it’s not exactly like the “ring” add, the game is still very fun! | No ads. Forced fast tutorials, easy game play, constant rewards and interactive activities. It’s actually really fun and the expanding Alice in wonderland world and characters is super engaging. I do not play phone games. I’m sold on this. | Could have been enjoyable if there weren’t so many pop ups begging you to spend money.  Impossible to play due to the constant clutter of “offers” on the screen. | Nice game l like it | I am a big merge fan and this by far is one of the most interesting games by far! The graphics are beautiful and there are so many little quirks that taking merging to the next level! Definitely enjoy the “ring” mini games as well! Quite refreshing, worth the space lol | I’m glad theirs no ads so far | This is a merging game more than removing rings. Not worth the Finishing this game | Fun game! | very addicting love it | I like it more than I thought | No me gusta pues no es fácil de comprender | I like the game, but there are times when you should be able to watch an ad to get a free item or more energy and I get a “no ads available” message. Restarting the app seems to fix it. Otherwise, it’s a fun app. | I just wanted to play a Ring game and it turned out to be another one of those building games!  I’m not sure what they’re called .
So if you want to just play the Ring game, this is not it. | Great game | Too much going on and difficult to level up. Very overwhelming but some fun stuff. | Don’t get it | This game starts off slow but gets more fun by the minute I just started yesterday and are already more intrigued for the next level can’t wait

But for me, I only give it a one because I can’t give it a zero. | Real cash back, AWESOMEEEEE🤩 | Is the best | I drive about 1300 miles a week, so I use a lot of gas. However, in about 3 years of using the app I’ve only gotten $300 back. Also, for the last several months, I only seem to get a penny back per gallon. It’s not even worth the time. | Great | I absolutely love this money saving app and literally get paid to make everyday purchases. It’s great! | The only thing that I could say and it just happened I accidentally swiped the upload option. And I cannot find how to upload my receipt to claim my last offer. Gas and in-store merch. Other than this I am thoroughly enjoying. Who wouldn’t like extra cash on things that are necessities. If anyone knows how to remedy this please share. Thank you bunches. | I was going to rate it lower than 3 stars considering the whole point of this app is to cash in on the savings, however over 50% of my gas purchases using their qualifying stations, don’t get processed and they expire after the pending period. Haven’t used it for any other savings other than gas so I’ll give it 3stars for now | I’ve had upside for about 2 years and I loved it but this past month it’s not been working. It’ll say processing then expired and that’s on my last 6 transactions. Mind you I actually have used this app a lot so now I’m a little sad it stopped working. | We have used this app numerous times, especially on gas. We save money on fill ups. A few of our favorite restaurants are on this app, more savings. I noticed on your new commercial, you advertised groceries? I see no grocery stores on the app? That might be considered misleading, unless you only have groceries in certain areas. Otherwise, this actually pays out, I have cashed out & will continue to use this. I agree with one review, sometimes it doesn’t load your usage when fueling up, having to manually try to record the transaction. | Haven’t received any call back since last year. I only use on gas purchases. I only have one card on file and always get an expired response | I’ve cash out for $100 for less than a year!! | Some rewards apps make you have to jump through 100s of hoops and accumulate so many points before you can cash out. Not this app. I can cash out (at least $10) after 3-4 trips to the pump depending on if I decide to go out my way to participating locations (no sheetz). 

I’d say it’s worth it. You do have to give them your debit card number instead of uploading a photo of the receipt for some locations. | I uploaded upside for gas cash back, 1 In 10 transactions get approved, too much hassle to find the gas station that has an offer and then claim, and most times it’s not approved. Do t waste your time on this app | I always have issues with them expiring. Yes they’ll manually add it after like a week after it tries to get the information. In my opinion that’s too long. Wish I could just simply add the receipt every time to prevent any issues.. didn’t go through, and used a bonus? Good luck getting that fixed. Need the screenshot of it to show them. Otherwise you took a loss. I keep trying to find the good in the app but it always seems like a hassle. | I think Upside is amazing. You can get free money by just making the normal purchases that you will make anyways…… I think it is a must have app…… | I would give more stars, but upside claims to give cashback but there’s barely any qualified store or restaurant in my area. Even if there were. The cashback is even lower than 5% like they claim from their commercial. It’s pretty misleading. Stores you shop at? Barely any in site. Restaurant? Just on or two in my area qualified. Gas station? It’s just a few but it’s not even places that I go to. Wish they offer more for Pensacola, but unfortunately there’s not much to worth using this app. | This app is for real the real deal. I use it all the time and it literally pays to use it!!! | I am very excited to see the real cash rewards on gasoline purchases.  I’m really happy I’m able to get some money back into my checking account.  Gas/Diesel prices are sky rocketed.  Every cent counts.   Thank you | The app itself was great. I was able to get a little over 20 dollars cash back balance in the app in less than a month and a half. I went to use the app recently and was signed out. I changed my password & once I was able to log back in my balance was gone. 
Emailing the company was no help. All they did was repeatedly ask me to provide them with another email. I had no other to provide because I only use one email and reiterated this to them multiple times.
I lost the cash balance because they couldn’t find my account from their end. And they were very unprofessional, patronizing & not helpful with my issue. 
Basically saying sorry nothing we can do for you have a great day. | I use to use this app everyday for purchasing gas. All of a sudden once I built up a cash balance I was locked out of my account and haven’t been able to get help to recover my information. | I’ve been using upside for a few years now and I love it! It’s not just for gas, they also have several local restaurants and some grocery stores with cash back offers. | Enter the code “MP5VTZ” during signup for an extra 15¢/gal off👍 My family has been using this for a couple of months and it has been great. In the beginning with bonus discounts we were seeing around 60¢/gal off at some places, 20% off grocery, 40% off restaurants, just wild! Discounts seem to mostly go down after that though, and your offers will be different from your friends and family. We asked Upside support about this and they said your discounts depend on a wide range of factors that are always changing, both on your end and for each business. Time of day, how often you go, how much the business wants to discount, etc. I’ve noticed that some restaurants and grocery stores will have a limited number of offers that you can claim in a day as well, so keep an eye out for that. Upside support also clarified that active bonuses will show up on the current discounts you see, but will be applied to the next incoming transaction, which you might have already done, and it’s just taking days to process. So this can also be a little confusing but so far all of our transactions seem to have gone through no problem. Sometimes it just takes 2–5 days. My first gas experience needed a photo of the receipt, and needed me to type extra info about the station, but since then most places don’t require anything, apparently they match your card’s last digits with the business’ records to verify. Also your card info is submitted through Stripe which I already use and is very secure. Don’t expect transactions, cash back, and cash outs to happen quickly. Rather look at this as an occasional rebate where you get a nice chunk of cash you’ve built up, after you’ve waited to pass the $15 minimum of cashing out with no fee. So far for us it has been a great app that is helping us save money and also helping some of our local businesses receive more customers, which is great! 👍 | Veremos a ver que tal sale por lo tanto le dejaré una reseña de 3 estrellas en lo que veo si es verdad que cumple This free app gets you cash back on gas! Use promo code SABDIEL3534 | Upside is great especially when you get cheaper gas while earning cash back. Thanks Upside!! | The app is user friendly and hassle free. Who doesn’t love getting rewards for everyday purchases like gas and food. | There’s no way you can earn $5 by pumping gas especially with the prices and only pennies on the amount of gallons | It’s not much but every $ counts! And it is super easy to do. | Excellent App. I've already saved almost $300 | I purposefully go to businesses that use upside! Wonderful app easy to use. With this economy you need to save as much as you can. Thank you Upside! | What a plus when I discovered it today. I need to be more observant and use Upside more often | Great free app to save money and it’s all legit. | Good savings on gas for cash back and restaurants. Use it every time i get gas now | Thought I’d try it after seeing it would give me good gas rate; but it brought me to an Arco gas station that was closed down.  Found out from a local it’s been shut down for over a year!! | I’ve been using this app for a couple of years for fuel for my personal and business vehicles and I’ve saved a lot | I love the app | Awesome, no complaints | With gas prices forever on the rise cutting into our monthly budget significantly I really appreciate this Upside app to save on every gallon. | Update 4/22/24
Since it’s been over a year I thought I’d give it another try.

Same crappy service. I’m done won’t be back.

App was recommended by a trusted source. Regrettably the app relies on capturing your debit / credit card number to track purchases. Which would be fine if they would match it to the restaurant you ordered from. I grabbed a 7% off from Bueno Ye Sano. I ordered online and picked up. The receipt does not have the last 4 of my card. Which would be fine if the app didn’t count on matching the card number to my receipt. Try to get app customer service about this and they are non existent. The answer bot says it can’t answer questions. I’ve not had any issues with gas purchases and this was my first (and now only) restaurant. I traveled over 10 miles to save 7%. Which I will not get. That purchase was Saturday and it’s now almost 11pm on Monday. The worst part is that I have 2 good burrito bars in my town. Both less than a mile from me. | I click claim, then use my credit card and click I’ve paid.  I thought I was earning cash back, but I just realized my cash never shows up. It says it has expired (which it isn’t supposed to do.) I tried to contact Upside support, but you have to provide a date, a receipt and a store. I have about 10 of them, some as far back as December.

This is very disappointing! | I’ve submitted pictures of receipts and they are stuck in “progress” and later deleted. It’s a waste of time. I’m highly disappointed. | Used to receive rewards with no problem most of the time but now, likely most transaction now will expire and waste of time using this app. might as well use the apps they recommend not to use to earn rewards. | Upside logged me out of my account without my knowledge or consent. 

I can't log in because it doesn't recognize my email account or password. 

When I try to change my password, I'm sent to a page that doesn't exist: I get an error. 

When I try to set up a new account, it won't accept my email address because it's already in use. 

When I try to log in on their web page, I can't: I have to use the app. Which doesn't work. 

I have money in my account. 

So: questions for company:

Why did this happen?
How can we fix this?
Will I ever hear from you??

I already know the answer to the last question: No. 

Or am I wrong?? Prove it. | It doesn’t cost anything besides a few moments of your time and I’ve collected about $80 | Delete and find a better app | This app is clearly a scam. I’ve tried to get gas back over five different times and it’s never giving me the money back for it so I don’t understand how other people are saying it does it for them maybe in certain areas and not certain areas but that’s not fair for everybody. This app really doesn’t make sense to me.scammers | This app is so easy to use. I literally get money back for doing what I have to do anyway…putting gas in my car.

Such a totally underwhelming experience. I have dined there prior to the pandemic and couldn’t wait to go back! What happened Chef Vikas Khanna?
The amuse bouche soup was tepid and the flavors of the coconut milk clashed with a tart ingredient I couldn’t put my finger on
The first course appetizer chaat spheres were good but could have used a little more of the peas
The second course pav bhaji had red chili powder that was way too much and more importantly raw - I had to request butter (which they didn’t have) but were nice enough to provide yogurt to temper the taste of the raw chili prefer
The main course I ordered the Arbi with veg nihari- had some uncooked/ dry rice
I passed on dessert as I didn’t want to be disappointed further
Sad as I really looked forward to going back
Trying Gupshup on Saturday
Will try to get into Bungalow - cannot get reservations
Hope I have better experiences there. | Yelp is ok, but Yelp Guarantee is just for show. Yelp Guarantee is very effective in adding confidence that it would seem Yelp has vetted providers. However, when you encounter a problematic provider that Yelp guarantees, they will do all they can to delay and as much as possible not honor their so called Guarantee. Until now, my issue has not been resolved and their support takes all their time to respond. | The place where friends are made over torturing a wolf pup. Never go here!!! | Your not showing me the menu | I want to thank everyone, the Doctors and specially Yenny and Susana they are always so helpful and nice to everyone. Thanks for helping me getting the appointment to see my doctor as soon as was possible. I appreciate you. ❤️🙏 | Si po | If I specifically type into the search for a well known name of a restaurant, don’t show me 15 other restaurants and hide the one I actually wanted to look for. I typed that name in for a reason: I wanted to see reviews for that restaurant. If you want to spam me with other options, fine, but don’t treat me like a toddler who doesn’t know what he wants. | Don’t come here girls, go to real professionals and save your money. | Fantastical! | Lo mejor para mi negocio | Thank you for your services in my home. Thanks | Had such a good and relax time. Dinner was good pot roast tasted super yummy and Alma was our server super nice and helpful. Very attentive. Will be back again | I’ve tried posting a review on a business page at least 10 times and it doesn’t show up even after the webpage says my review posted. Super frustrating. | Dine in  |  Dinner  |  $50–100
It’s such a nice new place in Islamorada. The food was delicious , stuff was wonderful, there is no better view , for sure we will come again . Thanks Charles that you came to our table to ask what we think about your place ! I think you couldn’t do better then that and you are so nice and handsome that immediately I offered you to get together with my daughter 🧒, I wish you a lot of success in this place, you built it with a vision and a good one . | This is the worse Lexus dealership experience that I have ever had. I love Sterling McCall. I am a previous customer and when I went to look at a car today to see if I wanted to trade up I spend 20 min walking around with no one to greet me. I saw one many chauffeuring a couple who acted like he did not see me. There were 3 people at their desk watching me walk around.   Do yourself a favor for all of your hard earned money the it to another store! Do not buy here! | Terrific street tacos. Toppings the best. | Greattt | This company is trash. No support for bad reviews in areas. We have never serviced nor done business in. | Todo esta muy rico | Let us assume there is a hypothetical review that can be conclusively proven to be a lie. As long as it describes the reviewers experience, the review will remain. Meaning Yelp allows people to make libelous reviews and remain unpunished. | Started blocking VPNs, so I can’t review Yelp on Yelp. | Positive feedback matters. Thank you for creating a way for us to share. 💋 | The real customer reviews are not shown, and it always shows that the reviews are not recommended! This software is not fair at all, very bad | 10 minute delay was told to pick any any chair on the plane for weight distribution from Kona to Honolulu. The emergency plan is to exit at the front of the plane. Demanding people sit   20 seats back no one sitting in the exit lanes over the wings to open the emergency doors not required because that is not their emergency exit strategy! FYI, future flyers of southwest. Encourage people to inquire if this is standard for all airlines. | I called Precision Appliance Repair for a 
Issue with the washing machine.  They responded quickly.  The young man that
Came to my home , Thomas Cardenas
Took care of the problem right away and did the repair.  I was extremely satisfied 
With his performance.  Before leaving he took the time to put it thru a cycle making sure it was working correctly.  Thomas also cleaned up after himself which isn’t always the case.  The owner, Jayson was on top of everything as well.  I have some other items, smart appliances that I need help wit so they will be getting a call as soon as I have the time.  Thank you Thomas & Jayson⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | Nesha was our bartender when we sat at the bar. She was very attentive, suggested our drinks which was great. The drinks were amazing. Food came out promptly and was hot and delicious. I would be returning and bringing friends and family. Will definitely be back as a normal. | Our server Edwin was EXTREMELY attentive, and Manager Melissa checked in on us a couple of times! My husband and I both got Victoria’s filet, and it was cooked to PERFECTION!! | This park has been cleaned up a TON over the last year or two.  No more homeless hanging out, clean public bathrooms with toilet paper in them, newly paved sidewalks and paths.  
They even have “A Little Library” next to the new children’s playground and fenced in park area.  They’ve finally taken out the sand in that area too, and replaced it with poured rubber tire & entirely new jungle gym structures and drums/pipe tubes for the kids.  there’s not a ton of seating but it is shaded it looks like they’re in the process of putting in new picnic type tables last week when we were there.  There is no off leash area for dogs at this park but there is a Lisa Jackson down the street.  However you can take your dog for a walk there and go down by the Bay.  It’s nice! | App crashed when ordering from Olive Garden within app. | We order from Kim Shang at least once a week. The food is generous, very, very good and is ready in no time flat!!  The staff is friendly & accommodating. You can’t ask for a better takeout restaurant. We highly recommend it!! | Jeff just finished our laundry and powder rooms. Excellent job and extremely neat. | I have never written a review but in this instance I feel compelled to let folks know not to use this place. I took a trench coat in for cleaning. I purchased it in Italy. It had amazing details. Natural Cleaners completely destroyed the leather buckles on the sleeve and the very unique buttons. When I got the coat back, the buttons had threads hanging from all the buttons which, I reiterate, had been damaged. It was an absolutely horrendous dry cleaning job.  I immediately brought the coat back for repairs. They said “the owner” would call me. No one did. I had to call repeatedly for several days before getting a response 6 days after I brought the coat back. When “the owner” finally returned my call, he left a message saying they had ordered replacement buttons and buckles. I called back three days later to see when it would be ready and was told they did not know when I would get it back. When I expressed dissatisfaction about this given it had been now over two weeks since I took the coat in “the owner” asked what he was “supposed to do.” I asked him to give me $200 for the time and expense associated with getting the materials and coat and finding and paying a tailor to fix. He told me he would send the coat back to the store. He then hung up on me. For the amount I have spent at that store, the unapologetic and cavalier attitude from the owner - who I literally had to hound for a response - is clearly a statement about how he views his customers and the quality of work which is quite poor.

I would not use Natural Cleaners after this experience. | Used to not have this, and this made finding a restaurant much faster for me. Thanks! | Courtly Island, let's convicted sex offenders live in their park Steve Roeglin convicted sex offender out of Wisconsin. A felony plea bargain down to a misdemeanor rapist, attempted rape, sexual abuse of a child all perverts just the same. | I was driving by I noticed this place I stopped in for lunch and I'm very glad I did the food. Excellent day. I've been turning my friends onto it daily to try it. You won't be sorry. The food is molta Bella 🇮🇹👍 | Yelp is probably a good app. I don’t think I take advantage of everything they have to offer.  Sometimes hard to navigate, at least for me. Mainly use it to find restaurants in foreign towns and cities. Pretty helpful in most cases. | Love this place the coil is amazing but today I had beef enchiladas, which were very tasty! Tina had chili Renos, which were awesome and there was so much food we took more than half home with us | Fun and friendly place for the whole family. I would recommend coming here on the weekends with friends and family. Don’t forget to check in on Yelp to get free tokens. Located inside Westminster Mall right next to JC Penny | Very friendly staff and delicious food, we have been looking for a great Mexican place to go as a family and I finally found the place! I 100% recommend this place! | Super place!? | I’ve avoided many mistakes by reading the reviews. | We went for happy hour. I got the Meat Lasagna and a glass of Cabernet. It was a nice and relaxing atmosphere and the staff was friendly. Will definitely go back. | Went to the Krystal for breakfast at my favorite store on South Broad Street and made a point to get there before 11 o’clock when they stop serving breakfast. There three egg breakfast platter is always good and filling. I have a watch that is extremely accurate, so I walk into the restaurant and waited for someone to come out front knowing that breakfast should still being served. When she stuck her head around the corner from the pick up window I gave her my order, she shrieked back at me that “breakfast is closed!” I replied that looking at my very accurate watch which read 10:55 and said “but it’s not eleven o’clock yet.” She shouted back that it was after 11 pointing at a display that I could not see. I said “Mame it’s five minutes ‘til by my watch” at which point the manager sticks his head around the corner and shouted “it’s five minutes past eleven and breakfast is closed” refusing to serve me my usual three egg platter that is always good and fresh. I showed him my watch showing 10:55, and he threatened to call the police. 
      I patronize that Krystal regularly and have found the service to be good,and I usually leave a generous tip to the same lady that has been there for years which I feel certain she appreciates. 
     I will go back to that Krystal, one of the Many Krystal Restaurant that I designed the drive up windows for over fifty years ago and which I have patronized ever since. If either of those rude, lying individuals is there, I will get their names, add them to my list of liars, and leave.  
     I will continue to write accurate reviews on all the Krystals I patronize, and maybe the service will be better, and they will stop lying about setting their clocks 10 minutes forward. If I were their supervisor, I would fire both of those lying individual on the spot. KRYSTAL, YOU CAN DO BETTER!!! 
   Signed. A disappointed patron of over 70 Years | Wanted to try a new place for anniversary dinner. I ordered surf and turf. Filet was just fine- nothing special about it. But I was served spoiled lobster tail. The odor was so intense I am not sure how their chef let it out of the kitchen. Yeah not the greatest experience for $250 price | I just finished a tour of seven countries in Europe . This hotel was my favorite . Excellent service . Very comfortable . The staff was very helpful and friendly . I will definitely be back with my family . Located in a safe area . We walked to the near mall and felt safe . | Good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good love? | Overpriced, average bbq and bad service. Bartender probably said 3 words to me while I was there and it wasn't crowded. | Bought a Nissan at Olympia Nissan with the help of Tira Morrow, sales.
Very professional and no pressure 
Very happy with the service at Olympia 
Joanne D | We stopped in for dinner and drinks and had a wonderful time great atmosphere.  The food was so good and the service was incredible.

It is a seamless system for parking and I can add time from my phone! Love it! | The app makes paying for parking a breeze. I especially enjoy being able to pay from the train on days when I pull into the parking lot just as the train is arriving. | It was ridiculous the amount of steps, and codes to pay. verifying by email, then by phone . Takes too long to pay !!!!!!!! | There is no limit on length of parking here. Why is there a limit on this app? Are you trying to have it run out and then charge me. I will be away from my car longer than your app allows. This feels like a purposeful move on your part to cause me to pay a fine to you. | App doesn’t work! Did not extend parking. Got a ticket. You need to fix your bugs. | Where  in the app can I get fees that apply to Ft Lauderdale residents? | All good!! 😊 | No notification on Lock Screen about how much time left | I have a few license plates under my account and accidentally clicked the wrong license plate for three hour parking stay. Realized it only seconds after I started the parking and trying to switch license plate to the correct one - no options to do this. The virtual assistant did not help and basically told me to re- purchase the parking, no refund options. This is not a good practice. | Why is there a pop up ad for Wal-Mart?
You are making enough money from on this app I shouldn’t have you soliciting for Wal-Mart. | The app keeps glitching. It has caused me to get TWO tickets while trying to pay. | You already have my card info. Don’t make me get my card out!!! | Accept Amex | Why have the feature when they never work? | I repeat your app is garbage | $0.50 meter rate cost $1.20 with fees.
Carry quarters! | 15 minutes is supposed to be free. But this is still charging me. | It allows to park for 3 hours but can only get 1 hour | Borderline entrapment of forced parking ticket due to instability of payment processing. | Very impressed with the ease and functionality | Fast app! | This app is so easy to use. I appreciate how it interacts with my Apple Pay- making parking very simple

It’s the easiest of all the parking apps | Apple Pay doesn’t work | Miami price gouging paid 10$ for 2 hours next 2 $30 hours @ the Bay | Can’t always tell where I’m supposed to pay for parking when there is no meter, and the ap doesn’t always let you select a location… I got a $100 ticket because this ap wouldn’t let me put time on the meter 😡 | App crashed on a Friday night.  I was at a show that was going longer than I originally anticipated and wanted to add time to the parking.  The app kept spinning and a red banner came up saying the app was experiencing issues. I had to leave the show early in order to avoid a possible parking ticket. | Easy to used and manage thank you keep the good work 👍 | I love this app but the lot I use has a problem where many of the stalls do not appear on the app so parkers must pay by license plate instead of stall number and I don’t see a way to do that in the app. | It would helpful if you carry over your payments from one parking spot to another.  Although you can extend. You can’t get a return of time 
Some places you can only stay 2 hours. So you have to keep moving 

Parking is not visitor friendly. 
Some times it’s hard to get a signal and the app processes for a long time. 
Times that are free to park is not posted clearly

There are street sweeper times to watch out for and towing hours to watch out for 

It would be nice if you left before your time was up you could either use that money for the next spot or get a refund. It’s not like a parking meter and the next user can use the rest of your time. | App is so much better than the machine. | this is is so unreliable and somehow is completely imbedded into vancouver bc parking. twice in two days i have gotten tickets bc of app malfunction and guess what, conveniently there is no way to get help outside of waiting for a bot email. | I tried to extend time 4 times.  The app wouldn’t let it do hours. Only mins. It didn’t send me messages on time left 
It’s not as user friendly as I need | Quick and easy way to pay the meters. Wish more places would use this as the way to pay for parking. | I am paying for parking and should not have to scroll through offers! | This app used to be awful years ago- I used to pay and still get tickets.  No way to resolve so it got expensive!  BUT, they have worked out the bugs- hasn’t happened since 2020… I only use this feature because there’s no other option to park at my job. | Lots of issues. Never works well. Hate it. | Love being able to pay and extend my parking through the app. Love the reminders that my time is almost up!  Love not getting a parking ticket because I forget or can’t make it back to a meter in time. Love love love’ | What a horrid application. Had to download in order to pay for parking because the card stripe reader wasn’t working and it was a terrible experience. One use and I’m already receiving ads. Had to save a credit card with the app owner in order to pay for parking instead of being able to utilize Apple Pay, PayPal, etc. Stay far away. | Love this. It’s quick and easy to use. | My Dog loves your parking and convenience to pay online with his paw. | I am not sure what the purpose of multiple choice adverts. | Works better than every other parking payment app out there. Every time, no fuss, it simply does what you need. | I don't want to see ads and offers after I've paid for parking. I turned all the ""Promotions and Privacy"" off; why do I still see them? | Every couple weeks it declines all my payment methods and I have to Delete and reinstall the app every time | An awesome lil app with a sharp design that empowers and puts control into the hands of people who park. The app conveniently recalls previous parking data making the process faster and worry-free. The notifications keep car owners aware of the parking countdown while offering a link to extend parking seamlessly. After years of submitting to the Parking Demon, I’ve broken from the chains with the tech-leveraged magic of PayByPhone! | Parked at 4hours max spot. App only allowed to pay for 1 hour and then only extend by 30 minutes at a time. Sometimes extend failed as well, so had to keep retrying

UPDATE: Turns out that you can pay for 4 hours. There is a field where you can enter arbitrary number of minutes/hours to pay for, but it is not obvious at all. Numbers you are presented are just suggestions. Bumping to 3 stars. | Gadzooks this is klunky and awful.  This sort of app has no business not integrating with Apple Pay so that it’s all one tap that doesn’t need me to give a real credit card number to whoever runs this.  It certainly has no business using a wonky credit card camera scanner that forces you to use a tiny area of the screen and then omits digits every time.

Most restaurants have this working nicely without an app at all, just scan a QR code to pay, why does this even exist? | Makes parking so easy. Love the extend feature. | La
Aplicación se demora para cargar por debilidad en la señal
De Internet | There are 2 apps in Miami in which you’re allowed to park with. Parking mobile and PayByPhone. By mistake I hit the wrong app and paid a location in which my car wasn’t.

Visit https://help.discoveryplus.com/hc/en-us","17.40.0",0,"USD",true,325058494,"Discovery Communications","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/discovery-communications/id325058494?uo=4","https://discoveryplus.com",4.87415,"I was recently forced onto this ill conceived, slovenly app when MotorTrend+ shut down and moved everything to Discovery+.  Since that moment I have not been able to Chromecast any one of the shows I previously enjoyed.  It causes me to wonder what the + stands for.  Is the ‘+’ symbolizing the additional difficulty and needless complexity that has added to my life?  Is the ‘+’ a moniker to denote the extra helping of 1000 lb sisters or 90 day fiancé that I could now weave into my highly gasoline and motor oil based viewing diet?  I think not.  I’m sure there is an executive somewhere at Discovery that, in a fit of originality and to make a name for himself, decided that it was too much expense to keep a separate and functional application for the gearheads and that we would all be better off if we could toggle in between a good old fashioned engine swap and getting a polygamous baptism from a few episodes of Sister Wives.  Those of us familiar with the 80s blockbuster ‘Ghostbusters’ learned early on not to “cross your streams”.  Well, in this case, I am afraid combining these two apps has resulted in a chain reaction that has caused total protonic reversal.  In layman’s terms, “I’m out!”

And Sure!  I’d love to cancel.  The only problem is that I never actually signed up with Discovery+, so the mechanisms to stop this meaningless drivel from entering my home are and likely will remain a mystery.  Under traditional circumstances I would likely close with something to the effect of, “Shame on you, Discovery.”  However, I think the exploitation of a few morbidly obese women and the normalization of others on the fringe of society is enough proof to demonstrate that shame is no longer an effective deterrent.  So maybe just a generic “Way to go!  Good job!!” Will be sufficient to speed the Discovery channel along towards bankruptcy. | The app functions and has many features of other streaming apps. My one gripe is that the app doesn’t support a simplified log in when it is installed on multiple platforms. It still requires that you log in normally with your password when installed across multiple devices. The use of a QR code or other activation code when doing an install on another device (other streaming apps like YouTube, Prime Video, Paramount+, etc all do this and it makes life so much easier when installing on a Smart TV and logging in with screen-based keyboards). 

Otherwise, the app seems stable and I’ve had no problems this far. | They killed street outlaws and npk. Not worth paying anymore. | Has lots of stuff to watch. The adding of Motor Trend into the fold of the app is what’s keeping me on it. | Quit messing with us! If it’s on Discovery and is a original Discovery program put it on D+. Having to buy another app to just watch a couple shows I like but is NOT on D+ is ridiculous. | The app went from great to good.  The reason being is that a lot of seasons were removed from shows I watch like Monsters & Mysteries, etc. | I enjoy watching the paranormal shows. I am elderly and bed bound an I enjoy watching on my iPad. | I love the shows and like that I can watch them on my schedule. | I love the shows, love everything except one thing… I wish I could turn off auto play. If I fall asleep to Mike Rowe talking in how the universe works I hate waking up hours and episodes later. I wish I could turn off auto play but that’s still a small issue compared to how much I love it | They are not airing anymore street outlaw shows. Without that it’s not worth having for a couple shows like gold rush! | I LOVE this program. However, you haven’t updated Seaon 9 & 10. Why?  I have been waiting and waiting for you to update the show.  Please put them on? | Me encanta solo quisiera que tuviera el idioma  español | Over a year ago, I saw a Verizon ad about Discovery +. It caught my eye because I could see it on my iPhone, TV, computer, etc.. The more I read, the more interested I became. So I got my Discovery + added on my iPhone. I also saw the option for not having ads popping up. That was great! I have enjoyed Discovery + since then, everyday and night. I can put my earbuds in, enjoy it at night, not disturb my husband like TV could. I love the “No Ads” option! Now, if I don’t have my Discovery+, I am devastated. I am now thinking seriously about putting it on all our TVs. Much better option than cable to me. Do I recommend Discovery+? Absolutely! Every chance I get. It is the best and very reasonably priced!
         Happy User, Janice G.   N.Carolina | Funny | I’d like to see more crime and mystery shows or documentaries based on real life .. like newer missing people, unsolved or solved homicides,  shows about addiction and addicts… just real life struggles that everyday people go through… those are the best shows by far | .. | I love discovery + it has so many shows and things to do.  It is a great channel. Thank you . | On Roku, anytime I watch an episode it will revert back as unwatched or partially watched. Super annoying. I thought it was a bug, but it has been going on for months. Then I tried stopping the show at the end, letting the next show start (why does shows I do not have saved start here, that’s another issue I don’t like), rewinding, fast forwarding… nothing prevents it from showing episodes I have watched as not. | This app has to many problems and they don’t seem to fix them. I was watching moonshiners on my other iPad and my screen had purple showing up in different spots then the whole screen turned purple and I’ve thrived every thing even called the geek squad they looked at it and couldn’t get to go away and I couldn’t do any thing with it, so I had to buy a new iPad again then  with my new iPad after I got it all loaded I installed discovery+ again and with in two day the same thing happened again. I’ve lost two thousand dollars on two iPads plus my subscription paying for something I can’t even watch. I gonna cancel my subscription . | Hi discovery plus really love this app thank you for adding episodes from guy’s groceries games season 35 you do know you still missing part 1 of Antonia vs jet and part 2 Antonia vs jet as well. | Does not show you the program while you are fast forwarding or rewinding like all the others. Not even worth mentioning the rest, as I have sent them emails and they’ve done nothing to fix anything. | The River bank flows bro | Paying fora subscription I no longer can use on my iPad due to iOS 13 requirement. | If you are using a phone to stream to the tv or plug into the tv to play it will constantly stop working and say theres an error. Sometimes it will work fine for hours, sometimes it will mess up ever 30 seconds | I love watching Mythbusters, but I noticed that several episodes are missing, even whole seasons. Please check! | There is no Spanish at all. My wife loves all shows from TLC. She prefer Spanish speaking. Most streaming services have Spanish speaking. | One of my favorite parts of the day | Got this app to stream street outlaws NPK.  Waited long enough.  I’m out. | Worse streaming app ever. Nearly impossible to watch anything | Amazon Prime and Discovery both said that the series Expedition Deep Ocean was available when purchasing Discovery+.  We purchased this app based on that information. The Discovery App says that this series is not available.

Watch out for false promises - we have enough streaming apps. We will cancel this subscription. | Can always find something to watch! Also shark week central. | I’m an advent fan of the food network and HGTV, so when the discovery streaming app was launched, I was thrilled to take full advantage of streaming without ads. This streaming app has been live for 3 or 4 years and the kinks still haven’t been worked out!! 

I’ll start with the most aggravating thing I deal with is the need to log back into my account so many times! It doesn’t matter if I’ve been watching every day or hadn’t turned it on in weeks, I’m constantly having to log back in. What’s even more frustrating is when you have to log back in, there’s no ease of administration, like a QR code. The keyboard on the app is so joke, it’s so first generation streaming!! With Apple, Amazon or Netflix, they make it convenient to log back in when necessary, so please take a look at what your competitors are doing to provide the best user friendly log in possible. 

The app doesn’t use any AI to facilitate what you might like based on the content you’ve watched.

If you’re trying to find something you’ve been watching and can’t find it on the network, then you have to exit out of the network and do a search for all of the networks the app supports. 

The buffering has gotten better but it’s still too much. 

The app loses where you are in a show or it’ll go black with no reason. 

It’ll ask you if you want to skip the intro but not every time when you’ve been streaming the same show & come on, who wants to watch a 1 to 4 minute intro!!

Just please get it right developers and listen to your biggest fans. | This is for the Samsung tv app.   Stop with the logging out.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to use a remote to enter the login and password?  There is absolutely no reason to log me out on my TV.   Rather large and attached to the wall. | AUsome | This streaming service is my favorite with plenty to of good educational content! | Disappointed by not being able to update! Cancel my subscription! | I’m here for Mud Madness, that show is great!! | The app works fairly well, all that’s needed it to have the option to use full screen mode and when you move your phone it doesn’t stop every time. | I like this app because they had all the good ID crime stories. Now all they have is repeats. I see new shows in ID but Discovery+ don’t show them on the app! I’m paying $8.99 a month and I’m seriously sick of watching reruns . I love my crime stories.  So I may be looking for another app to watch. | Loved the app right up to this morning when I was prompted to update the app. Come to find out my old iPad will no longer support the latest update or iOS version. Not buying another device so I’m disappointed that I can no longer take my shows with me on the road. It says I can download the last version but its not offered anywhere that I can find, I can see the history but nothing available to download. | Why do I have shows put back on My List, that your company took off, without any seasons or episodes to watch? They all say “episodes currently unavailable!” What’s the point of putting them back on My List, if there ISN’T ANYTHING TO WATCH? I e-mailed your company, but as usual, the problem WAS NEVER CORRECTED! Please add the seasons/episodes back so that I am able to watch them again!!!!!

*******IF YOU ACTUALLY READ WHAT I WROTE, I TOLD YOU THAT I ALREADY DID E-MAIL Discovery+ AND NOTHING WAS DONE!!!!******* | You should offer refunds for accidental subscriptions | Love not having to watch commercials | We love Expedition Bigfoot and enjoyed when you could view new episodes early!  Please do not cancel that show.  We want more!!! | I love this discover.
Why would you go up on your rates?
I’ve had Discovery + for a very long time.

When I started watching it. I paid more for no commercials.
Now here we are AGAIN more $$$ for no commercials!
So aggravating!!! | Discovery has the best of every world!  I’m a True crime junky and have been watching different shows on Discovery for years and there’s still so many more I have yet to tap in to.  Don’t know how I’d survive without it😉 | So good a lot of good shows | There is so many different types of shows that Discovery+ offers, that it was made for all of us I swear, but if not, it was definitely made for me lol! All of the interesting and quality shows that they offer, pretty much make it so that I could just live on Discovery+ all day and feel fulfilled. I know this sounds like they paid me for this or something but it’s just that honestly every type of show that I truly love is on this channel. Between mysteries of the abandoned,to all the house, hunter shows and unusual, Home things, to what on earth and the science shows about space… I’m so happy! Thank you Discovery plus! | Excellent app, all the shows you’ll ever need all in one place. Epic, love it | I hope Roadkill and Roadkill Garage keep going. I heard that Engine Masters has been cancelled, but I really liked that show too.",4.87415,799076,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/85/8d/1e/858d1e58-0cfe-1004-2d3e-5bc2cfaa9cae/c2c6235e-1d86-4b78-8f28-15d5beeb9753_5.5_Mobile_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/bd/eb/62/bdeb62f2-22d9-e479-7801-3469c79519d2/0d5f2f44-753a-4d9d-aadd-c1132deab749_D_U002b_30.1_Apple_English_US_PH-5.5_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ac/b5/2a/acb52ab5-6bf5-cf37-053b-2af250eedc06/dc9d509e-6346-434f-8bcd-513935b186c1_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_PH-5.5_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7f/3e/e4/7f3ee4f9-4067-85a2-8ba0-dd8a5bfe0916/81c08fd5-e71f-446a-a50d-319c826360df_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_PH-5.5_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4b/b8/05/4bb8059a-6b5c-a865-2cf0-9d4b64619196/491e5fc5-b470-439e-9d61-f0d45c27e68a_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_PH-5.5_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/d8/85/18/d88518c9-13eb-d7a6-9052-24a65e4e25de/3ca54c48-8805-49ef-b2ce-0c863b239ead_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_PH-5.5_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7c/8f/78/7c8f7861-5eef-1fa7-708d-eb07864a9843/407c1d31-2bd6-4ebb-bba0-945b50da1892_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_PH-5.5_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/32/01/2a/32012af4-7f62-d990-a3f9-edfb8414e065/efda04e8-7724-4131-a597-9272a033c8b7_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_PH-5.5_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/9a/95/0f/9a950f14-cdbb-5723-6c90-3abdc664e267/d8e7b1d9-499e-4b16-a093-de185ab64415_iPad_2.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/46/f5/3f/46f53fbb-3cdf-ca73-1a7b-454bbf4fa059/a9ac6e87-c8ca-47d1-bd61-ff04c724d16d_D_U002b_30.1_Apple_English_US_TB_1.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/32/23/c7/3223c793-f4e4-7808-13e7-0ec8307de07c/bb290283-b82a-4a20-b4d7-58fff0ae207d_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_TB_2.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7f/2c/d8/7f2cd814-f5c9-be27-48a8-773991800cfb/6b28cd6b-51a6-4a04-9ae2-17bb7f998edc_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_TB_4.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/17/0c/45/170c45cc-f9b0-e163-1981-5e507d8b94cc/a417fc53-402a-4083-b14d-331b54a401d1_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_TB_5.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1d/9f/15/1d9f15a5-625e-90b8-fc25-28a3e7e84059/2691baa0-0e2c-46b4-9838-de14c88d99bc_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_TB_6.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/37/9b/5d/379b5d85-2317-d720-52e7-70a1272fe390/38fe9696-16d1-4cd4-9d3d-c190cd21c919_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_TB_7.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/cb/7d/d1/cb7dd1c6-0b96-215d-b38f-8675a880845a/9b3e4e1e-d5dc-4911-b036-e247108dd865_D_U002b_27.2_Apple_English_US_TB_8.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellula

Terrible app. | This app is great! I love the extra information you get from the $20 a year subscription and for $20 it was a great deal. The alerts I would get are super helpful as well since my regular weather app doesn’t do that.

But now I got an email notifying me that the subscription is raising from $19.99 to $69.99 which is absolutely ridiculous to have that kind of jump! I will definitely be unsubscribing now. I will miss the extra features but it is not worth $70 a year. | I’ve emailed 4 times over the last 2 months to support over app issues without a single (non-automated) response.   Widget is consistently not showing the correct location or weather.  When I open the app it shows the correct info.  You would assume opening the app would update the widget info, but it does not.  Also when using the app the data is very slow to load, even though my internet is 200mpbs+ and other data driven apps work great.  Would appreciate customer service especially to subscribers. | This was a great little app when I got it, for 10/year. Now 60/yr is laughable especially since it’s just repackaging NOAA data. | What a scam. Shows it is free and immediately is $7.99 after 7 days. | I NEED A SUBSCRIPTION FOR EVERYTHING! TO MANY ADDS | Comparing this weather app to others, it definitely did very well especially from an accuracy point of view, but it’s definitely not worth the increase from $20 a year to $70 a year. The app isn’t all that fancy especially the widget was useless so I just always opened the app itself. At this point I’d rather go with a cheaper version of what this app can do that’ll be fairly accurate. No app is dead accurate! Think for your self always. | $60 annual price, cancelled !! | On my app it’s been raining in central Indiana for a couple weeks now. Pretty sure something’s not working properly | Weather is so dynamic it’s not always easy to get it All 100% right!  On occasion my weather in my specific area, east of those massive Rockie Mts which are their own “influencers”, is different But it’s rare.  Thanks for working hard & improving it all the time. | Just got a notification that the yearly subscription for this is going up from $19.99 to $69.99. That’s a crazy increase. It was a pretty good app. But definitely not worth that. | Any app that increases the annual subscription to over 6X the previous amount deserves to have loyal subscribers abandon ship. Absolutely ridiculous. Subscription canceled. | I’ve read the contract and TOA. Social engineering. Bending Spoons wants $80 to send your information and behaviors to their (or all) third-party for their financial interests, not yours. They are violating HIPPA. Double dipping, 190% price increase. This is a popular app. It’s probably already been compromised. Bending Spoons will not tell you if your information or who has it, they don’t know for sure. That means they don’t have control over this app and your intimate information. Clime and Bending Spoons is an appropriate marketing communications name, not to be confused with NOAA. The original app I had 4 years ago was far better. This app has regressed too far. Apples built in app works fine. | This app is broken. When I tough the arrow, to start the radar moving image, I get the weather report for place underneath that arrow. When I then touch my location, the moving radar image stops. This started relatively recently. A longer-term problem has been that when rain was falling right on me, the radar image showed no rain in the area. Now, to sort-out how to stop payments going to this fraudulent app developer. Edited to add: Well, apparently, this did not get through, the first time. UPDATE, Alril 18th, 2024; this app is still broken. Surrounded by obvious thunderstorm activity, this app is BLIND to it. | Just wanting to watch the weather since I’m outside of tornado siren areas. Immediately duped in to a one week subscription for $4.99. Are you kidding me?  Run away. | How can I trust a weather app that thinks sunset is at 1:11 pm and sunrise is at 11:29pm in Branson, MO on April 17th, 2024?

This has always been my go to weather app - so much so that I pay for the subscription - but with obvious garbage like this I guess I’m going to have to find another app. | $19.99 to $69.99? Joking right? 
No way, cancelled. Goodbye. | This is not a free app there is no free version it is subscription only so just a heads up.  They should just be upfront and honest about pricing very deceptive and manipulative.  If It’s subscription only then just say it not that difficult.  Save yourself the trouble there are better options out there without the deception. | A 6x price increase for an app using publicly available data is bonkers. Do you guys think you’re AccuWeather? it has been good to have this app and the Pro features, but bye. | I wish I could trust this app it says it is clear and it is actually raining you would think if you pay for it it would be some what accurate | This used to be my go-to weather app but since switching to iPhone it’s never worked right. The widget constantly gets stuck in the past or old locations. I regularly have to go into settings, change the location setting to something else, then back to “while using app or widget”, give it a minute to think about what it’s done, and then it finally figures out where I am. I mean, whenever I go to work it thinks I’m in France! And no, I don’t commute to France for work. I can’t get a quick glance at the forecast, the app itself hasn’t been all that accurate, and with the subscription fee jumping so much this simply isn’t worth it. I’ve installed/reinstalled several times only to have to reset all my preferences and then guess what? It doesn’t know where I am or what time it is. I’ve sent in requests to the devs multiple times for this issue only to have the same suggestions (uninstall/reinstall, check location settings) suggested. It’s bad for $30, atrocious for $80. | There are a ton of weather apps out there. To go from 9.99/yr to 59.99/yr is a joke. See ya! | I’ve been a paid subscriber to this app for years and each April it is time to renew and I think about all the issues the app has that just shouldn’t be happening. The past year has been really rough for the app; I can’t see the lightning strikes regardless how it’s toggled, the widget is typically blank or hasn’t refreshed, and I constantly have to go into location setting and turn all location info off then back on just about each day to ensure the widget does update. For two weeks the widget just sits blank on my phone. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app so many times. I’ve emailed support and they have recommendations for how I can fix it, which I stated here, but the fix is only good for a few hours, a day at best. | 5 degrees is pretty substantial.  Wow. | Love the forecast, the ability to let app know actual conditions if different than observed….   Only complaint is the wind section - it doesn’t show/describe wind direction | Bait and switch I purchased a lifetime subscription to this app on the Google play store. I then changed to an Apple device climb began sending me annual renewal coupons so that I could utilize what I had paid for this year. It appears the company was sold and between them and Apple they want to start charging an absorbent annual fee for something I already paid for, if I were you, I would use a different product very deceptive people. | A lot of people can’t afford your price gouging app | This app is not worth that. Canceled my subscription. | Widget stopped working. That’s a shame. I work outdoors often with dirty hands or gloves and don’t want to open the app for basic, at-a-glance information. Yearly price more than tripled! Decent forecasting but price cannot compete with others. | My first time at trying to send a text using my iPad. | Too many pop ups, graphics are horrible.  Downloaded because of intense storm forecast.  Can’t see map of my specific area with any clarity.  Maybe the tornado warning s wilp work.  Maybe sometime in the next decade, the radar site in Hammond,La will actually come on line.  It was taken down in Slidell and moved more than 2 years ago.  Long time to he without good radar coverage in an area prone to hurricanes,tornadoes and flooding. | I really enjoyed this app and found it very helpful. I canceled my subscription because the fee went from $19.99 to $69.99 per year | So far good | You have to pay for something’s | I actually paid $9.99 for this app last year and I kind felt ridiculous paying that much for a weather app.   My renewal notice came a few days ago and the price jumped from $9.99 to $59.99 for the year! That price hike is ridiculous. | I’m looking for an alert in my phone like a tornado alarm and for Severe weather too | Not accurate. At the tame of this review it was supposed to be raining in my location but instead was sunny and clear of clouds. | Shows Weather Patters, Forecast Above Average. Layout is good as is the navigation. Its as good as other apps no beater/worse. Premium for $5/ week? No go. Grown tired of the excessive $$ for subscriptions for everything. | I used to use and rely on Clime for weather radar and notifications, and when I had issues, I used Clime support and got fast responses. 

But for months now I’ve noticed app notifications stopped working even though I have them on and on in my phone, and support does not reply. As a result, I just cancelled my subscription because although it was apparently only $9.99, the app isn’t working and working correctly, so I was paying for something that didn’t work and support isn’t helping. | I just could afford the paid version but otherwise it’s a good app! | Happily using this app for $9.99 but a price increase from that to $59.99 is insanity. Sorry | Typical modern day bipolar company. Not another dime. | I have a yearly subscription for $70 a year

However my gripe is that they’ve removed features which I’ve paid for.  The app is acting more like a ad supported version instead of the feature rich one they had a year ago.  They’ve removed features which I relied upon. 

I’ve contact support but I’ve only received computer generated emails and no actual support.     Don’t pay for this app | Keeps saying I am two states away 
Unresponsive controls
Won’t renew | Keep getting winter storm warning from a location other than mine. This is really annoying. 
The forecast is for over one hundred miles away. Where can this be changed? | Now Bending Spoons is bending my wallet for all kinds of little features. It’s like they figure out how to monetize the toggle switch for each little app feature .

No thanks. Seriously, the new ownership destroyed the trust i had for the app. Tornado Warning - wait, we’ll show you an add to subscribe to wind speed maps before we take you to the text of the warning. No thanks, I’ll use the noaa website going forward. | This app does more review mirror than anything. All useful features have been stripped out— unless you want to pay. I guess I should feel sorry for the developers. They are just trying to make a living during Bidennomics. Unfortunately things that don’t contribute to food on the table have to go. This app and other non- essential social media and news channels must go. This app primarily because the basic has no value. | It is a complete travesty that a nationally funded organization is charging citizens to see safety information like tornado tracks. | How can you charge $5 PER WEEK for features that are free in other apps?! That is simply daylight robbery. | Forces you through a pop-up experience to buy premium EVERY time you open app. The “X” to close out the pay-to-play screens is invisible - VERY deceptive. I deleted the app immediately and do not recommend - users don’t have time for these games.",4.46378,995252,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/34/40/c1/3440c1b8-4c48-c5e5-cc13-8e3083a4d5a5/e440ebaa-f52b-42fe-a0d7-8e2243a6de29_iphone5.5_s1_en-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/8e/0c/19/8e0c1901-1adc-a0f3-95b5-a81b9d3ede42/4d58c0b1-8295-4dee-9740-b39a6c3a480a_iphone5.5_s2_.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/64/8b/86/648b86b9-4fab-18bd-93e0-cbd599005efd/7a65b61b-fb5a-40ee-95d7-449c124aebd3_iphone5.5_s3_en-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/30/10/2c/30102cc6-3398-6ad6-1d16-79e02948362d/fc1ca508-55f4-4a24-b478-f22ef1616277_iphone5.5_s4_en-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/66/fe/2d/66fe2de6-c7a2-26d3-4ec8-7f3e458f9bcb/63a3022b-82d2-4d2e-909f-1a9f76044b93_iphone5.5_s5_en-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/07/2e/ae/072eae82-52ab-6aa4-e3e0-57ff247a0cd6/0797d5a5-c198-4cb5-9599-310bac9ef43c_iphone5.5_s6_en-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/d4/de/be/d4debeac-358d-be9d-c35c-73a2f14eb091/18a3aca1-fee2-4e27-a129-f726ad905765_iphone5.5_s7_en-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/62/26/ce/6226ce17-d7f8-18e2-eed2-c272169778e0/72b1e42f-675d-4904-b0f5-90558ab05d9d_iphone5.5_s8_en-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/cf/65/4b/cf654b3b-a315-8a70-3d46-265c19ee7d8d/a4b88403-143c-4b59-a6be-73c78a00f9d9_iphone5.5_s9_en-US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/a8/14/78/a81478af-f717-f4d0-f5a8-fd145384e23e/d9926d13-0344-4a9c-986f-fcb5eb1befe6_ipad_12.9_U00282_U0029_s1_en-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/04/f8/ad/04f8ad3a-31a3-2af3-cfb2-830b5a85d915/c50d2fae-00b8-4cb2-8e30-9f718db75547_ipad12.9_U00282_U0029_s2_.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/c0/42/32/c04232db-2d5b-75a0-4415-78cc1d5553f9/81e3fccd-e764-4102-a33e-950176c07f34_ipad_12.9_U00282_U0029_s3_en-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f5/1d/da/f51dda65-7921-037b-c3a7-4d228be49ef9/92efb53c-b873-443e-80b5-5c1f5991506c_ipad12.9_U00282_U0029_s5_en-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/bb/d2/b0/bbd2b08e-6104-fc2c-eaac-74649aaceae8/ad95e64e-2c10-4bcb-b204-2973c2600527_ipad_12.9_U00282_U0029_s5_en-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/97/52/58/975258c5-062d-ee95-d7d4-c372be4db2b4/fabc0b09-babe-481e-a4fa-52ddfed0a170_ipad_12.9_U00282_U0029_s6_en-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/fa/d7/dc/fad7dc5f-86db-2010-38d5-77d4c757f4f2/4e289712-7e22-418d-9666-9cfc77751e41_ipad_12.9_U00282_U0029_s7_en-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/af/6f/f4/af6ff4a4-0d2a-91b4-7012-768191544018/94835fda-c35c-4d6c-b659-0b8628cfc826_ipad_12.9_U00282_U0029_s8_en-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/75/0f/3c/750f3c05-de5e-4b9d-d939-aef6fba57ec9/48396cf8-abdd-4736-b710-831623749eda_iphone12.9_U00282_U0029_s9_en-US.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""

Get the app, go into it and then it does do anything or offer anything. | There is a 45 minute delay in my flight. 

The airline shows the delay. The airport shows the delay. Flightradar24 shows the delay.

Meanwhile Flighty, the paid service: ON TIME!

Great job guys. | An excellent app!  Keeps track and keeps you updated with all the latest updates and information on the flight.  I totally recommend it! | The iPhobne app has no troulbe loading the map under the flight path on airplane wifi. Yet the Mac app is unbelievably slow to load, and sometimes absolutely refuses to. It also won't load in the background, so if I want to see the map, I have to sit on the app for 5 - 10 minutes. This is with plenty fast airplane wifi where every other aspect of my system is working fine with said connection. | I have spent most of my airline career being frustrated when I’m the last to know about changes to a flight I’m the captain of. Why am I the last to know? Couldn’t someone tell me these things?

Flighty picks up where airline internal facing IT drops off. Really where airline general internal communication drops off.

What gate are we out of? It’s right there on the Lock Screen. Are we on time? Right there. Don’t even have to unlock the phone. And it all just appears automatically as it imports your schedule. 

Need to add a commute flight to it? Just yeet the confirmation email off to flighty and it’s in there. Doesn’t matter who the flight is on. 

Inbound flight status? Yep. You get all that. It just tells you. Don’t even have to ask. 

I can’t emphasize how much the “it just does it” factor weighs in here. You just point Flighty to your calendar and it just runs. You don’t have to add flights. It’s doing that in the background. 

Halfway to your walk to gate 97, they change it to gate 2? You get a notification. You don’t have to walk up to the gate like a stripy shouldered chump looking like you’ve never heard of a gate change before. 

Then there’s just the “cool” factor stuff. Map of your flights over the last year? How many miles youve flown? It’s in there. Not essential info, but neat. | As a former designer at Apple I am probably the pickiest person in the world when it comes to apps. Flighty is hands down the best flight tracker and probably one of my top five favorite apps in the entire App Store. It supports live activities on the Home Screen and shows a countdown to departure along with your gate on the Dynamic Island. The iPhone widget is lovely, as is the Apple Watch app. iMessage is well supported with a nice share UI for friends. If there’s a neat iOS feature it can use this app absolutely does. 

 Notifications are incredible. My flight was repeatedly delayed and I Flighty told me about it faster than Southwest’s text messages. 

 I don’t travel enough to make the annual membership worth it and love that they offer a weekly pay as you go plan. 

This app is clearly made with care and love. No other flight tracker comes close. I can’t say enough about how much I love this thing. Hats off to the team behind it, they’re truly stellar. | There’s an ongoing software issue with background refreshing on Apple Watch, where it won’t automatically sequence to the next flight in a multi-leg day, you have to open the app each time on the Apple Watch. 

I contacted support months ago and followed their advice with no success. There’s an obvious software glitch that they don’t seem too keen on fixing | There are few apps that I love, but this is one of them. It’s a well designed, impeccably executed product whose feature set is well considered and just make sense. And this app has been a lifesaver with respect to delays and cancellations countless times. I never take a flight that isn’t in flighty. And I hope I never have to 😍 | Latest version 3.4.3 is broke.  iCloud doesn't sync My Flights from iOS app to macOS app.  If it syncs, flights get put under Friends Flights.  When new flights are entered to My Flights on macOS, they get put under Friends Flights.  Brought up with developers, customer service acknowledged but no update to fix issue.  Pretty disappointing to pay almost $50 per year for the Pro version to see the app not work properly. | This app saves me all the time - Amazing!  Keep up the improvements 🙌🏼 | I would just like to say that it was a great pleasure to travel with Breeze Airlines again.
I can confirm that they have the best people in the industry that are willing to work for their customers.
From the start of booking your flight to the airport and to the plane their staff makes sure that you are the number 1 priority to them.
I would just Love to make a commercial for them to tell everyone about their superior service and their staff.
Keep up the great work Breeze Hierarchy as you are making a Good Company Go Great.

And Thanks again. | Absolutely no complaints, the features work flawlessly.  As someone who is terrified of flying I flew for the first time in 10 years using Flighty as backup.  The flight was delayed but I knew before anyone else at the terminal because I had live updates.

Can’t recommend more! | Really like the app as the No.1 app for flight. But I really hate when the Pro subscription Ad showing up every time I open the app. This is breaking all the good experiences of it | By far my favorite travel app (as someone who flies weekly) and one of the few apps I’m willing to pay for. Unfortunately I’ve had to disable notifications though. Like every app, Flighty has gone bananas with waaaaaaaay too many notifications (you’re flight is getting ready to take off, your flight is taking off, your flight took off, your flight is flying around in the sky, hey there are clouds around your flight, you’re going to land someday, you’re about to land, you've landed, you landed a while ago, you landed yesterday, etc). Yeah I exaggerate a little bit, but it’s not too far off. It would be refreshing for app designers (and email marketing “experts) to wake up to the fact that people HATE too many notifications. The more one gets something, the less value it has. How about offering notifications for just important items such as when something goes wrong (gate changes, significant delays, a wing falls off, etc), instead of EVERYTHING? 

Peace and love Flighty team ✌️ | This app revolutionized the way I travel. I can check my flight and flight options whenever my flight is delayed. It syncs beautifully with my calendar . Hope they create different friends flights profile in the future as right now I have all friends , family and work colleagues flights together . For “my flights” it works great. A sync with Apple Watch would be nice also.  These are just improvements details from a robust , reliable 5* app ! | I track a flight maybe 3-4 times a year. Every time I open the app it’s always “get the pro version” ad. Horrible experience. Will never purchase. | All of sudden in the last week I have not been able to add flights. Once I type the airport code it does not generate. When I hit next the previous flight I inputted only comes up. Please fix | One of the key things missing for me in this app is information on the planes altitude. I find this to be interesting and useful information that all other flight trackers (eg FlightAware and Flightradar24) have. 

It’s also a bit concerning that sensitive information like your booking code get shared when you share a flight with someone. There should definitely be an option for this. 

“Where’s my plane” is also pretty buggy often. Shows multiple conflicting flights, or no tail number ever available. It seems like you should be able to get more accurate data for this. 

Also, a promo code to discount the annual or lifetime purchase would help… 😃 | This app has a gorgeous UI.

Big concern/annoyance is that there isn't a way to share flights with others without sending sensitive information like the booking code.

About 20% of the time the ""where's my plane"" feature shows incorrect information. Surprising because if I research it on my own on other apps, the right information is available.

Also, there should be an Android version otherwise you can't collaborate on flights with non-iPhone friends. | The app opened one time and was extensively glitchy. As soon as I tried to view the first flight, the app crashed and would not open again. | $4.99 a month just to add older flights to fill out your passport is ridiculous. Sure there are other features but to use that as a lock out is ridiculous. Uninstalling and not trying a trial of the other features. | I generally love this app for its rich feature set, but today it failed me. My flight was delayed by an hour and 20 minutes, the announcement on the Delta app coming 45 minutes ago ands, but Flighty still shows it as departing on time. I knocked a star off for this. | “Very resourceful it keeps me informed and up to date of my upcoming flight, I love it.“ | I'm a product designer and no easy critic when it comes to the UI/UX of an app. This app is so well designed that it makes me want to travel more. I crave hearing the airplane chime when a flight is added and seeing my stats change for the year and seeing a new path added to my passport and....I could go on. Point is, it's my new favorite travel app and you should absolutely pay for pro and support these developers. Safe travels! | But Flighty has been a legitimate game changer. Sure, I could cobble together most of the functionality it has by having five different apps, but even then, Flighty is better and faster. It often has updates on things like gate changes and baggage carousels before the airline apps do, and it is just otherwise seamless to use. 

When I add flights to my calendar, they appear in Flighty within seconds. 

I’ve also added my wife, who travels for work a LOT, as a Friend on the app, so I can see when she takes off, when her flights are landing, etc. 

I find the premium features at $50 well worth it for the price of basically one airport meal. 

Anyway, obviously a fan. Highly recommend. | but extremely well designed | This is a great app if you have a specific flight number that you want to track. However, if you’re interested in just looking around at random flights, or looking at flights coming in and out of an airport, you’ll be sorely disappointed as you can’t do this. Wish it was at least an option, especially with the yearly fee being what it is. | Flight info is either updated once a minute with incredibly annoying alerts… or it's not updated at all. At this very moment I'm on a plane still sitting at the terminal that Flighty says is ""taxing to runway"". #sigh I don't see any value above what the airline apps already provide. I signed up for a subscription, but I'm letting it lapse; it's just not worth anything. You know what would make this app *great*? Highly detailed terminal maps. That’d move the needle for me. Otherwise, I don’t get it. | Best most accurate info and timely. Easy to use. I wouldn’t fly without it. | I am extremely picky with apps I use (I'm a software engineer by trade and a bit obsessive and critical with app design). This is a top 5 app I've ever used. Up there with the likes of Apollo for Reddit (RIP).

Amazing design, super useful features, and plenty of nifty trinkets and hidden features that you won't realize you'd want until you see it.

Super useful for tracking your flights, your friend's flights, updates while at the airport, and native-iOS integration with live widgets, dynamic island support, etc etc. The list goes on.

10/10 app. For real. | Trying the app out. Flight delay info is completely off. Airline app most accurate. Flight aware second best, flight tracker 3rd. Flighty info all over the place. | Best app in App Store | Love this app. Really helps @ | The app is very helpful, but I’ve never had airplane mode work.  Connect to free in-flight texting with iMessage on Southwest and it never goes into airplane mode.  In flight updates are therefore useless. | Very good and easy to use | Nothing seems to be left out of this app that an air traveler would want. Relatively easy to add flights. | 1.  This is my favorite travel app.  I pay because it’s good and I travel a lot.  

2. Recently when I send flights in via email it does not add to account.  After sending in a third time via email it seems to work.  This should be fixed.  

3. I’ve written to customer service about the above issue without response.  I had a database issue about a year ago and it took them a few weeks to respond.  By that time issue was resolved.  I’d suggest they respond to all customer service inquiries from paid customers within 48 hours.  

I’d give the app 5 stars.  It’s great.  But a few issues remain to be resolved. Overall you’ll enjoy the app very much. | They never answer customer questions. F&Q really doesn't have answers what you need to know. App works fine there are some glitches here and there but works good. However the customer support basically doesn't exist so there will be zero solutions to your problems. Not recommend to purchase the subscription, but keep it in free mode to use it otherwise you'll be frustrated with the unexplained problems. | This is really the best app for commercial flights, totaly awesome! | Works better at keeping me updated with my flights than the airline provided apps ! | I fly 150-200k miles per year; this is my all-time favorite app in this category | Great App ..I love the updates..very convenient | This is what happens when you pester customers! | I signed up for a premium family membership after seeing rave reviews. I’ve reported numerous data issues over the past month and none have been resolved. Every flight I’ve taken with LATAM is incorrect in some way, having never updated upon landing (only estimates show in the app). One even has the wrong aircraft information — I’ve reported this three times to no avail. Also, older flights from the 00s that I took on Continental are incorrectly showing as Copa Airlines. These issues need to be resolved, particularly regarding LATAM flights I took this month (Google/flightaware have correct info) or I will not be renewing my membership. | Look else where. Their costumer service is one of the worst I seen. | What an incredible app!  So easy to use and love the updates!  Recommend it highly!!!🤔🛫😲✈️🤗🛬 | I am shocked about how the app is so user friendly, displays a BUNCH of data but still is extremely aesthetically pleasing. I just simply love every aspect of the app and want to support it by purchasing pro. However, Im a person who likes one time payments instead of annoying subscriptions. When I wanted to subscribe to the life time option, I found it quite too expensive and the price point is quite an outlier to the rest of the plans. | I like the app but hate the relentless, merciless, constant bombardment every time I open the app on my Mac or iPhone to ""upgrade to pro!"" Who does that? It's in the way of me trying to check something. Contacting support about it several times they deny this practice and keep saying it on;y happens occasionally when it actually happens EVERY. SINGLE.TIME.YOU.OPEN.THE.APP!! | I first heard of this app in apple’s WWDC,It has a lot of unique features and everything you need to know about your flight. | good app but unusable without paying $50 per year

A cool breeze!Derek1Cooper | Not that enjoyable kept slowing down and beeping | Used it ONCE and paid for the ride with credit card. Said I still owed $2.12 after 3 months of not using the app whatsoever. | Super ride | The ride didn’t go through and I was charged | Rear breaks are bad/ not safe and shaky when full speed | I have been in Austin for a convention. The hotel is a little further from the venue than I thought. Getting to use these scooters to go back and forth has been a blast!!! It definitely added to my trip!! | Great ride great price | My Apple Pay was charged $169…. They definitely took more then what I owed. Bunch of scammers will never use again ! | My first ride the tire was flat. How do I request a refund? | We thought it might be fun to take a scooter home but me and my partner in the end ended up spending 4 times as much as the uber would have been. Also had a scooter that wouldn’t go and had to swap mid ride. | Such a fun activity and super easy to use | Also convenient. App could be a little less confusing but overall good experience | Efficiency is key! | I purchased a pass after funding the account. 
It wouldn’t accept my drivers license or my wife’s. Thankfully there were like scooters nearby. 
Trying to get a helpful article on getting a refund was difficult and there was no help on our license situation. 
I’m giving bird the bird. | I supported this company when the the bird ones came out. The scooter was great until the last 2 months I can not lock my scooter in the bird app. I rely on this scooter to get to work but now have to take Uber😒. I noticed this company went bankrupt and I wonder if this is the reason behind the no support to fix this software issue | The cost of birds are increase | Feels like it goes when you don’t want it to..
Brakes need adjustment | Wouldn’t work and refuse to pay for ride | My Bird scooter never activated no matter how much I kick-started. I attempted to read all the self help articles and no help. I asked to bot for a human they sent me to an email. The technology shows you how far you have traveled and it could clearly see that I traveled nowhere yet still charged me full ride price. I have sent an email per the bot auction of yet another article and I’m doubtful I’ll find resolution to my issue. I had to walk the Bird to a bike rack per the suggested acceptable photos in the app however I picked it up on the side walk. What should have been an enjoyable way to get to my destination faster ended up in delays, unsubstantiated cost, and a much longer travel time to my destination. I will never use again. 

Shanttel | They pushed a notification to me letting my know I can tell my family to sign up for this app… yeah thanks. No more notifications for you pal | Speed 15-17 max mph | I bought a ride pass… supposed to have ride time everyday..The first time I tried to ride, about 20 minutes ago…The scooter I made it not even a full block and it stopped me… In no way that was my whole ride time... took my money, I didn’t get anywhere, placed a holding fee? For what?? When did I place a hold?? I did not… I hopped on and headed out.. Locked my card up! I got stuck clear across town in the bad weather I was trying to avoid… I dunno why there’s extra fees when I’m under my ride time and it’s a RIDE PASS!? Give me my minutes then seize up all you want.. If keep getting charged and not able to ride anywhere I will not ride these things ever again after my pass is done… when they first came out they were all cool but I regret my decision hardcore.. 🤦 | It charged me $15 for the first pre load because that’s what i put ,then it charged me another $7.61 and it doesn’t show why, and then it charged me another $15 pre load even though i still had 3 dollars left from the previous pre load and the money isn’t even on my account so it charged me for basically no reason | Why so expensive eh? | The scooters are everywhere. Which is great. But there will be a $15 pending charge per ride on your account for days. Which means a few rides could easily hold $75 and above for days. 

The other very real safety risk is the bells. In Downtown Seattle communication with other riders and pedestrians is key for a safe ride. I don’t think the bells have worked on one bike since I’ve used them. If I wasn’t an experienced rider I would not ride these. For this one reason it makes them very unsafe. 

I really hope they upgrade their scooters before people get hurt. 

So positive- they are everywhere

Negative- safety improvements need to be made as well as how they charge their customers | A lot of times it’s hard to find parking and the bike won’t shut off even when we are in a parking zone | Their payment system never works and has often left me stranded. No point in using a service like this if you can’t rely on it. | You will bre charged outrageous amounts and there is only automated robot support
These need to be removed from all cities | My trip cost about $50 and they took $120 from my debit card for security (a guarantee) and never came back. | I’ve had so many bad experiences with this app, I’m local to Memphis and most of the time the scooters don’t work but you still get charged for it. When you try to dispute it in the app they will offer a credit but if you want your actual money back it’s a lengthy process. It’s cheaper nowadays to just get a Uber or Lyft even if it’s a small distance. You will end up spending $20 to go a mile, it’s just ridiculous. Total scam and waste of money (edit to add, for the robot commenting on reviews to contact support, I already did and it did nothing so you can go right on with all that mess) | helps in cleveland | I wanted to do a ride with my friend in Reno, we both payed for the single day pass and they charged me 3 times! And every time that we tried to call to customer service there’s no response! Such a shame | So picky on where to park even though there are PLENTY of bike racks on campus. Made me over 25 mins late for lecture and used 40 cents less than $15 that I put on just for my one ride that is less than a 6-7 min ride from campus. Absolutely terrible!! I wish I could get a refund and already deleted my account. Don’t waste your money!! | But fun. Also super hard to ride while holding a coffee and your phone… wouldn’t recommend. lol. | The bird didnt work | Absolutely horrible technology behind this app. Riding in the middle of the street (where you are legally supposed to ride) bugs out and limits your speed to 3mph. This is frustrating and outright dangerous. It also benefits them as they charge you by the minute. | I’d give this 0 stars if I could. It’s way to expensive and the scooters aren’t reliable. This is just a scam so they this company can get rich. $110 a day | You can check my account, but there may have been 15 times where my card would not reload. Also the scooter that I got just died towards the end of my trip for no reason. | I attempted to use multiple scooters which appeared to have sufficient charge however they did not work.  There appears to be no way in the app to dispute these supposed rides which clearly show that the scooter never left the starting location. | Most of the bird scooters on our area were non operational. We were still charged the startup fee and charged for the 0 mile ride. Never use Bird in Memphis. | WORST SCOOTER. Shady company. Ridiculously bad app. Doesn’t tell you where you’re even allowed to use until it’s too late— then they steal your money. Never using again. | the sobriety test doesn't let me type | Charges are very unclear, ride passes disappear from your account, customer service is nowhere to be found. I see why company is doing bad and going bankrupt | Will charge you multiple times for a day pass. Won’t work properly. No customer service. I will never use this all again. Same issue with my brother who was riding with me. | Brakes are needing repair or Maintance | The app is extremely buggy. Often it will not load beyond the splash screen. Restarting the app does not solve the problem—instead one must delete the app completely and download it again.

Update: Bird has responded here saying they would like to look into this. The reality though is that I’ve already written to support multiple times about the issue before posting here. They have not been interested in investigating the problem. | We tried to out our scooters away in a designated parking section, just for the app to not let us end our rides and tell us it’s not a parking spot, even though it clearly was one and there were other scooters there. We decided to ride to where we originally picked up the scooters but that, unfathomably, was not a parking spot either. We couldn’t end our rides and it kept charging us, with a total cost of 125 dollars just for riding three scooters for an hour. During this stress I called the number and tried to report this issue, but conveniently there were no people to help us with our problem no matter how much I tried calling. We are trying to get our money back but we aren’t sure if we will be able to. The fact that public transportation costed us a weeks worth of grocery’s for one hour is disgusting.",4.8852,1383613,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/43/79/4c/43794cf1-a63c-c8a0-a151-4acc8d28b0cb/a942cacc-8a1d-4884-b083-d7c75ded04f3_Bird_AppStore_8plus-01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/7e/02/34/7e023480-076f-04aa-7742-78a057a182c4/53eb8106-ae30-438e-bfb5-350196dc5021_Bird_AppStore_8plus-02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/37/33/00/373300a5-a00b-73f1-2313-5d8b41b3e52c/086a2a0b-2b61-4392-8007-c71adcebc343_Bird_AppStore_8plus-03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/cf/07/2b/cf072b0f-117f-b449-f721-9709ad7c8c2e/3a0a3f4c-c1c7-4236-8ae8-07d9f6c52007_Bird_AppStore_8plus-04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/77/5d/d7/775dd7f9-b9b1-e171-d313-daa4138fe8ff/012297d7-a01f-480d-a91d-ce3b7802b467_Bird_AppStore_8plus-05.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/eb/42/c1/eb42c181-3982-3bb8-ff30-c64b3c49e4bd/99068558-7325-487c-ab02-3bd9ae964e13_Bird_AppStore_8plus-06.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/7b/82/7b/7b827b94-0af4-4c55-91b9-7e4f2f7cc33f/86592aa5-1271-46bc-8398-76a34fda74c9_Bird_AppStore_8plus-07.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/c8/61/47/c8614798-f676-22ec-dcbf-611ad4d421af/49b23e29-5c01-436c-9ad7-cd189cd79676_Bird_AppStore_8plus-08.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"
1520656722,"gov.dhs.cbp.pspd.mpc","Mobile Passport Control","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobile-passport-control/id1520656722?uo=4","Mobile Passport Control (MPC) is an official application created by U.S. Customs and Border Protection that streamlines your CBP processing experience at select U.S. entry locations. Simply fill out your traveler profile, answer CBP inspection-related questions, and proceed straight to the “Mobile Passport Control” lane at the airport or seaport. 

MPC is a voluntary program which can be used by U.S. Citizens, Canadian Citizen Visitors, Lawful Permanent Residents, and Visa Waiver Program Visitors at any of the supported airport and seaport locations found on our website: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/mobile-passport-control 

MPC provides a more efficient, secure in-person inspection process for the CBP Officer and the traveler, and shortens overall entry wait times. 


MPC can be used in 6 simple steps:

1. Create a traveler profile using biographic information from your passport; You can create a profile for all eligible members in a family group. Your profiles will be securely stored on your device completely free to be used for future travel.

2. Select your method of travel, select your port of entry and terminal (if applicable), answer CBP inspection-related questions, certify the truthfulness and accuracy of your answers, and, upon arriving at your selected port of entry, tap the “Submit Now” button.

3. Capture a clear and unobstructed photo of each traveler (including yourself) that you added to your submission.

4. Once your submission is processed, CBP will send a virtual receipt back to your device.

5. Proceed to the MPC designated lane upon arrival and be prepared to present your passport and other relevant travel documents. Please note: MPC does not replace your passport; your passport will need to be presented to the CBP Officer.

6. The CBP Officer will complete the inspection. If further information is required, the CBP Officer will let you know.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/79/1b/d3/791bd364-368b-d141-95b9-f1dd3dc471cd/AppIcon-0-1x_U007ephone-0-0-0-0-sRGB-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel""]","[""6003""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN"",""FR"",""DE"",""IT"",""ES""]","49594368","15.0","2021-05-11T07:00:00Z","2024-04-02T16:31:36Z","Additions

the expiration time is nonsensical. if the time out is 4 hours, no overseas submission would be possible. 

finally, to submit within the 4 hour limit you d need to do so on the plane. but  enroute wifi is hardly widely available. 

bruce schimmel | So what’s the point? | Too complex, not user friendly even for a technical person like me. There are no instructions in QR code that you need to connect to WiFi or open App Store

There are simpler ways of doing this | The app doesn’t tell you that you can’t do it while taxi in - you have a time frame window of four minutes. So that’s something that should be noted UP FRONT . Don’t submit until you’re in custom hall. | Came in from Dominican Republic to MSP said Mobile Passport isn’t available
Because they can’t staff it. Huge bummer. | Downloading this app and taking time to fill it out didn’t result in anything getting better or faster; a complete waste. | Great app!  Thanks | When the MPC lane is open and working it speed things up a lot | They have the system but aren’t using it? What’s the point of having it? | It will make immigration entry much easier. | Great app and overall functionality, try it! | What’s the point of the app when every time you try to use it the lanes are closed or there is some mysterious problem with the app. | Nice job devs! | I like this app !!! | Excellent | Keeps giving an error after 20 times | Completed all the mobile steps for MPC entry but it was closed | Makes entry a breeze | Got to Toronto Airport . Did all process. It keeps giving me error. So couldn’t complete the process. | This program was very easy. Scanning was the best I’ve seen. | 10 minute wait with this. No wait for global entry | Very easy to use app. | This should have been easy, but multiple submission failures almost made it not worth it. Didn’t work until we arrived at destination airport. Hoping for better luck next time. | Terrible directions! I have a master’s degree in English and the directions caused me nothing but anxiety and stress. Hope this is used only at DFW and not in Denver. | Arrived in Miami this morning around 0450. Completed the Mobile App as did many many others ( you advertise to use it, so we do). All of us had connecting flights. Hurry to the US citizen line, and the mobile app lane is CLOSED. Asked one of the agents for the Mobile App line-stated it was closed.   Over 100 people in line most with connecting flights.  Only 3 agents working to process passengers. Multiple times the agent at the head of the line was told about the connecting flights. Let 1 guy go, but no others. Suddenly 9 people came from somewhere else and were able to jump the line!  THE PROCESS WAS SO SLOW!!  Many of us at the end missed flights.  I have used it before and it was GREAT. Not today | Need better examples for what the questions mean. Ex question one for “commercial use” what does that mean? | So I scanned our passports  now what? Where do I answer the 6 questions that customs wants answered? What’s the point of adding scans of passports | I prepared my submission, took pictures and when I arrived at the airport it wanted the pictures added all over again. Bad app and should work better. | Nice application | No one at the Dallas/Ft Worth airport even knew the app | What’s the point if it’s closed at busiest times?! | So easy and no problems! | Some airports that are on the app don’t have this service. It needs to be updated. Newark airport! | Very good got me right trough the airport customs!!!! Made the airport really easy and I wasn’t worried at all about missing my hotel taxi

It worked for a couple of months now I can’t get it to do anything??!!! Such a waste!!!! | Ford F-150 Best Truck Ever app not updating like it’s suppose to. 😠 | Can not redeem my rewards , kept getting net work errors | Great free app for now this days that everything cost you money to have, fingers crossed for ford to keep this app free!!

Excelente aplicación y gratis ya que en estos días todo te cuesta dinero para tener, ojalá Ford pueda seguir ofreciendo esta aplicación gratuita!! | Even though I set a schedule, the car never charges. It’s always stuck on ‘charging pause’ and I can never unpause it. So annoying. Plus all the screens is annoying. | The app will not unlock or start my truck 90 percent of the time | This app is awful. It disconnects and forget it if you do an update in the vehicle you will never get the app to work again. If they know there is bugs and issues with the app then why not fix it. This has been going on for awhile. Will be deleting and not using again | It’s very cool I like it thanks | The app lags a lot when trying to lock doors and unlock doors. | I do not understand why Apple ford can not fix the truck | Cannot activate my vehicle. Dealer and FordPass can’t help. Would love to be able to use the App again to remote start my car or unlock doors. | While entering 3rd party maintenance in service records the keypad will not go away to enter record | No sirve | Very nice technology | This app simply doesn’t work. I’ve been in touch with Ford Support and was told they are aware of the problem and are working on it. | Cant schedule service through the app tells me error when i click on schedule service needs fixed | The worst app.  9 times out of 10 it does not connect with the vehicle.  Can’t lock vehicle, can’t unlock vehicle.   Ford came out with EV’s.   How about coming out with an app to WORK with EV’s instead of giving us technology that you had Ford years. | My oil still has more than 60% of life and still recommending oil change soon. | Súper bueno esta aplicación indica todo | I’ve had an EV for a few years.  I’m so used to the Tesla app, which isn’t perfect, but 100x better than the ford app which I’m using for my E-Transit. | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | Great updates and instant status! | This app is buggy and glitchy. You really just need to start from scratch. Every time one item gets fixed it breaks two others. I tow a trailer and have set up the profile for this trailer several times, because things didn’t work properly. I tried to set up a trip with my trailer and tried to add my trailer but your app says it doesn’t exist, so frustrating. Please get a new app that doesn’t seem like it’s from the 90’s

Please feel free to contact me, Bill | Can’t track my vehicle.
Stopped working!!! | This is very nice to have during cold days and in the summer when it’s hot turn it on and cool it off or heat it up | About a year ago, a person was able to set the charge level and schedule for the vehicle from the app. No longer is this possible. On my particular MachE, I can no longer get the charge logs from the vehicle.
I used to be able to override the charge level from my phone if I needed to do a 100% charge for a long road trip. No longer possible.
It seems like there is features being removed from the app over the past 12 to 18 months. | This app is great when it is working. 
Most of the time it doesn’t work properly. 
I set a schedule for it to start. It actually starts maybe 1-2 times a week on the schedule I set. 
The other times I get a notification when it supposed to start, saying vehicle failed to start, could not locate. I look on the map and it shows my truck 50 miles away when I’m standing right next to it. This happens almost every time. I have to uninstall app, reinstall, add vehicle back in for it to work properly again. Just for the same problem to happen after a few days. It’s very frustrating. I don’t have remote start on my key fob so I rely on this feature, but somehow I always get let down. 
TYPICAL FORD. DO BETTER! | App is pretty reliable. Occasionally I have to unlock my phone to get the doors to unlock. | Very informative and helpful. | Won’t ever unlock/lock the doors or start the vehicle | This is by far the best app I have ever had for a vehicle and love it! | Fantastic app! | I don’t understand why people are complaining on here about this app. You can start your truck, lock and unlock, check levels. It works every time, and for my Apple Watch. | Hard to navigate and there’s no depth to each button feel free to contact me to talk about it. I would be more than happy to give reviews. I’m a new truck owner. | Love it | There are no offers that make sense and the tiers also do not provide anything. Completely useless application and program. | Crashes frequently and not always accurate | The app is great. I can pay my payments, remote lock/unlock/start. The connected services, on the other hand, don’t work nearly as well- as in not at all. I’ve seen a lot of chatter about it on the forums, but I’m not sure it’s worth doing a bunch of resets and such since I’m not currently spending money on any services. | Hyundai Bluelink is a 1000 times better, but the explorer itself is 1000 times better, I’ll meet it half way with the stars | App crashes all the time. Glitches out. Does not work. Just horrible. Ford figure it out. Tesla app works a lot better. | I was able to view my F150  on Ford site for
almost 6yrs. I now cannot see the vehicle information center anymore. | After using the remote start feature, the app takes as long as 24 hours to update for reuse. | Not intuitive, slow to update (unless it's in Ford's favor/ direction). Can't save changed settings to hold in one position until the OWNER acknowledges a change (ex running boards staying deployed until vehicle placed into Drive gear). All in all, about as user friendly as the dash ""owners manual"", which is ironically missing more than 50% of what's actually in the user guide. 

When I spend $80K++, I expect value for my money... and not something that looks/ behaves/ interacts like something that a semi competent middle schooler doodled on a napkin at lunch 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ | Ford’s app has minimal information that the driver/ user could use to improve their driving efficiency. I love my lightning, I wish FordPass would tell me more so I could understand my trips and consumption more. 

This app is a glorified “key to phone” that tells you your charge percentage and projected miles. Compared to their competitors in the EV/hybrid field, Ford could do much better. Also what’s up with not picking out Over the Air updates all at once for all vehicles. 

Do better Ford, we ford EV drivers deserve it. | I received outstanding customer service today !!!! | Why did I have to change the password on a 3 year old account to get in! I don’t like it! | So happy for the ford pass team at first I couldn’t put on my phone because it wasn’t updated once i called ford pass she waited till the update was complete then told me exactly what to do my life has been easier every since | Very bad | 5 stars ! James was excellent, great staff ! Thank you for your time.

It is less painful to pull teeth than use this app for managing your internet. | I WILL NOT ACCOET THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO USE THIS AS IT VIOLATES MY PRIVACY. | To log in to the tmobile app on my iphone that runs on the tmobile network I have to enter my tmobile iphone number? ""Rewards"" may not work. | I wish this company would work as hard improving the service as they do working on scamming us.  We don't need another useless app we just need the service to work. The only use I have for this app is restarting the gateway from the couch instead up walking over. Which I end up doing anyway because the app wont work. Tmobile is the worst of the worst. | This app is just ok. I do miss the simplicity of the T-Mobile Tuesday app. I don’t need all the other stuff that comes with this app besides the Tuesday stuff. | Easy to navigate, very user friendly. | Even though the App Store says I can download a previous version, when I open the previous version, I get a screen that tells me I must update tow the IOS 16 version. I cannot do that since my phone only goes to IOS 15. I keep trying, hoping that TMobile will correct the issue, but they have not, so I can’t get into the app anymore. | after the T-Mobile Tuesdays app merged into this one, I haven’t been getting ANY notifications which means I haven’t been getting any of the deals offered. I went and checked my notification settings and adjusted them but still nothing. at this point, I should just delete it because it’s just wasting space on my phone | Unfair to change the iOS compatibility to 16.0 when you have current customers on 15.8.2 
No discount provided, for no access to benefits paid for on monthly bill, and no one bothers to create the website access for us customers.  A real let down from the company to not consider all the customers and only focus on customers with new phones to reap the full benefits.  Shopping around for a company that considers all parameters and doesn’t leave their customers in the dark.  Per the tech dept, no change to come, in fact he just discovered today that the app is not compatible with 12.0 iOS and higher like it said in his system but rather 16.0 iOS and higher as I kept explaining.  Go ahead and listen to our call, so much for tech support. “No” should never be the answer to a customer when they are not being out of line or unrealistic.  This is bad customer service, T-Mobile. | I just picked up my free XL tote from the t-mobile store and i am really happy about it! BUT they haven’t been doing many good deals at all since this new version of the app got launched :( I think it is just now starting to pick up with good deals again! I hope the creators of this app to keep improving it for loving loyal customers! :) | So lame. Every Tuesday the app crashes. Not kidding. EVERY Tuesday! | Deals were better pre T-life.  Also one deal the free AAA for a year even if you had AAA already didn’t work for me. A rep for T-Mobil was suppose to handle this for me and didn’t follow through | The update says you can now manage remotely, but it still asks you to connect to the gateway via WiFi? Maybe I’m missing a step?? | App requires admin password every time to restart the Gateway. Will not use for this reason. | Doesn’t work. Won’t even connect to my router. No matter how many times I disconnect and reconnect to my tmobile WiFi in my phone it’s not recognizing my router. And the app before this for managing the internet didn’t even work either. Even when I get connected on the old app something messes up. Your managing internet interface needs some serious work. Why can’t I manage it from my web browser anyways? Or can I and I just don’t know about it. Things that aren’t told to you out of the box. | Offers are seldom honored, and disappear early. | My wife and I switched over to T-Mobile and we have been enjoying the perks and also we do like T-Mobile Tuesday. I haven’t had any issues redeeming the offers and just yesterday we were able to get get a chicken bowl from Panda Express for $1. I’m really glad T-Mobile is giving us these offers especially in this crazy economy | I have been unable to access Tuesdays offers for last 2 days. I deleted and reinstalled app several times with no luck. Message states a glitch that they are aware of and try later. | T-mobile always has amazing deals on food and free stuff, AMAZING APP HIGHLY RECOMMEND | I was with Verizon for umpteen years until they switched the cheaper plan to strictly AI bot service. It was terrible!
Now in T-Mobile for almost 4 years and every time I call about something I get a HUMAN who answers all my questions and even credits me money if the complaint is justified. I choose T-Mobile as Number One! | This app started off cool, with some real deals for T-Mobile customers, but now it is a platform that pushes lack luster deals together with advertisements. I don’t know why anybody would download an app that just displays ads with an occasional coupon. | Unable to logout of the app.  I deactivated my main account and tried logging into my wife’s account, but it won’t let me.  Not even deleting the app and reinstalling it allows me to login with a different account.  Plus it’s a hassle to set up multiple tlife accounts when you have multiple phone numbers in the same bill. | You can’t access t life if you have an older phone. I was able to with tmobile Tuesday. Now I’m excluded from these deals, which I pay for on my monthly bill! I SHOULD get a discount if I can’t access it!! | why would you have deals that come out on tuesday expire by thursday night??

they should last until the next tuesday! this is ridiculous | Advertised soemthing, downloaded app and it is not as advertised….smh | I love this app and all the offers you get. Thanks T mobile! :) | I enjoy every Tuesday that there’s something new and enjoyable for almost everybody but I enjoy the gas points the most | Sweepstakes entries don’t work because after you put all the information it needs. The “ENTER “ tab is blocked and sits under other words. This has been like this for almost a year now. | So much stuff I can’t even use !!! Get better stuff | This app is garbage and never seems to work. I’ve tried clicking on the Tuesdays offer many times and it almost always says error. Because of this, I didn’t get my freebies for a few weeks including the sunglasses. Is T-Mobile even worth it if their Tuesday app won’t give me my benefits? | Afaict, this is just a standard customer service app that’s been designed to prioritize marketing. You log in and the first/only thing you see is like a huge Burger King ad or something. Plus the name “T Life” is painfully cringey. | Is so much better 😭 | I have a single notification badge that will not go away since the switch to the new app

Please please assist. It’s been months. | Let me just tell you, if you think these offers work better for customers on the mainland, you are WRONG. I can’t think of one time I’ve went to use a perk for a discount whether it be Little Cesars, an event or my most recent disappointment. “Blink23” promotional offer that came directly to  me in the App Tuesday and in my inbox. So it really was meant for me right a loyal cellular customer with on time payments for over a decade (a long-time Sprint PCS customer, T-Mobile, by default. But I was pretty excited to get the home security camera offer (3blink outdoor cameras exclusively for loyal customer like me willing to put my home internet needs (the Wi-Fi Nework, the lifeline to all the uploads and downloads of the household. ATT has been satisfactory and I wouldn’t have left them, but for the promotion so offered by TMobile. They promise to help get the promotion even giving me a couple follow up calls making me believe they have resolved the issue and they would enter promotion manually. This was all going on late Jan thru mid Feb then on to early march when it finally occurred to me, this offer was long gone and they kept passing me off like a hot potato. I probably spoke with 7 or 8 individuals in attempt to resolve this my satisfaction and I think at least 6 hrs in total including the phone wait times. Finally I said, look I will settle for the current promotion the $200 as a prepaid visa for switching home internet carriers, I was told ooops sorry all promotions need to be taken advantage of with the first 30 days of establishing the line for service. What?… it specifically said promotion could not be redeemed until after at least a full billing cycle and payment was current. They said well for your trouble I can credit your bill for $50 …ok $75. I snapped back, “the promotion that induced me to cancel my other service and try your new product the 5G HomeInternet Wi-Fi  gateway was valued at more that twice the low ball cheap parting gift they wanted me to be happy with. I’d rather take the to court. In fact, this sounds like a potential class action suit.  I’m in California, you are in PR, we aren’t unique and if I was a gambler, I’d put money on hundreds of thousands customers all over the network who have these SHARED FRUSTRATIONS and Disappoints. T-Mobile, false advertising, elusive promotions. Shame on you T-Mobile! Doing this to little old ladies like me, shame on you 🥺 | When I first got unlimited T-Mobile 5G first month was amazing after that one tv constantly laggy. 1tablet and 1Tv dial up is faster. Trying to get ahold of someone to resolve this is horrible since I have never been able to create an account and even tried reaching out for that. Can’t wait to dump this service and find better | Pasting into the user ID or password fields , or trying to use a password manager to supply login credentials immediately locks up the app. 

No thanks. | Good customer appreciate | App freezes right after I enter my credentials. | T-Life replaced the T-Mobile Tuesdays app, but it’s a big step down. TMT showed all the benefits right up front, everything was clear, and claiming a perk was two taps on the screen.
The new app buries perks so you have to navigate to find them. To claim one, you get redirected to the t-mobile website in safari (not even the normal t-mobile app)…t-life doesn’t keep you logged in. 
They took an easy, user-friendly, no frills app and replaced it with so many extra steps and such a poor UI that I missed the one perk I actually care about, the MLB.TV subscription. Instead of its own tile, it shares one with multiple other logos at the bottom of its category. I missed it even while looking for it the past few weeks, and apparently it ended three days ago. It’s still showing up in the app though, so chalk up another negative for T-life.
But it’s the only option to access the perks you’re paying for, so good luck.",4.78113,439622,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b4/f1/b7/b4f1b752-c4e8-5673-fc81-45ee1247b7e5/92e3c6e9-f7d4-4857-8ff8-d899d7d4bf2d_5.5_Screen_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7c/5c/91/7c5c915f-0e7b-72ee-eefa-b46973c1e950/bddc9c54-a768-4213-b58d-5d29e3adbccd_5.5_Screen_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a0/c8/d4/a0c8d4c1-8040-dbd5-a39a-93e5785294ab/c4dd0e7a-e245-4c13-b04c-7e70765daadb_5.5_Screen_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/61/b5/65/61b5652d-1dc3-11d2-75a4-f4258e1db345/4a23123b-7642-488c-9f3e-144497e8e79f_5.5_Screen_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/24/e6/d2/24e6d281-1a92-50e1-f934-dbc569894551/959616d9-6b33-412d-9c79-846f0f6fd323_5.5_Screen_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b6/81/3f/b6813f80-fae1-e412-1774-7ee145a4d2f9/ee67363a-1c4b-445a-9774-a30cdbfa650d_5.5_Screen_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Find a different company to watch your animals. I’m sure some of the sitters are fine but the company itself is horrible. My sitter somehow accidentally changed the code on my lockbox after day 1. She couldn’t get into my apt to feed and take care of my animals - one being handicapped. The company wouldn’t provide or pay for a locksmith - that was up to me. I was in the ER as my dad had a massive brain bleed. I couldn’t just set that up during this emergency. Plus I didn’t know when the sitter could be there to arrange for a locksmith to meet her. Cats were neglected for days before someone could get to them. Read Reddit horror stories and you will see just how awful this company can be. This isn’t an attack on the sitters. The company I worked for when I was a pet sitter would have taken care of this 100% since it was a sitters mistake. Guessing this is what insurance is for. Find a better company, your pets deserve it. | We (family) enjoyed taking care of crispy. He is so sweet and always happy. We miss him. | This is only my second time writing a review for an app. I’ve been working with rover for 3 years and have good and bad to say about it. I’ve made some great clients that come back often. But per a client I just had I found out that they charge the owner a 10% fee to book. I thought this was absolutely ridiculous considering they charge per sitters 20%. I just had a 2 week booking for two dogs, that’s $700 for two weeks. I only received $560. $140 in rovers fees paid on my behalf and the $70 paid on the owners behalf. That in my opinion is greedy. if you’re going to make pet sitters pay a fee, the owners shouldn’t have to pay a fee too. The support on the app is awful. They also don’t filter out scam accounts. I’ve had people messaging me asking to have s** and others that asked questions like “do you have a boyfriend?” The accounts get reported, and I still receive messages from them. | I have really enjoyed using Rover to build my dog business. Rover has been really helpful at building more clients, and the app makes it really easy to schedule and get paid.

Something that would be helpful to me, and I think others, is being able to transfer the calendar to a another calendar. Make some way to transfer what’s on Rover to my everyday calendar. There have been times where I have dog schedules outside of Rover, get scheduled around Rover sitting dogs. It would be nice if I could just transfer all my dog sitting jobs to one calendar. 

Another nice thing, would be a way to get to know other local dog sitters. This way, if I can’t take care of a dog, I can recommend someone. I believe it is another way to show good customer service on our end. I don’t know if there is a way to get a local representative in charge of holding a get together or Rover sponsored dinner, but I was thinking somewhere along those lines. 

I still love Rover, and am thankful for all the support. | Since I moved to Florida, I’ve used Rover to find three dog walkers. Two were absolute hits. They were amazing. The one that was miss was the first one, the other two I love them. I don’t use anyone but them. I don’t like this app because of how pushy it is though, it’s so pushy. 
Once I book with the regular Dog Walker it takes me to another screen were it ask  “hey do you want to try one of these people out” and so many times I’ve accidentally hit contact sitter button. I am rebooking with my sitter, I am constantly rebooking with my sitter. Why are you showing me this screen? 
This app is not returning user-friendly. It’s more a once and done kind of friendly app. 

Had it not constantly been asking me to review them, where I can’t even click out of it, I wouldn’t have made a review.
But the app Forced me to click if I loved the app Yes or No, and the only way to get rid of it is to exit and clear the app. 

It works and it’s good but it’s pushy | Charlie is the best! Treats our boy like his own. Highly recommend! | Even better people working on it | The calendar it is not very convenient to use. It looks too busy. Too many things happening and not very efficient for blocking dates. | I love working for Rover and providing a safe haven and comfortable home for fur babies When they are away from their parents.  we have a good time we spend a lot of time outside we play we exercise. We cuddle and I make them feel as comfortable and at home as possible, so there's no anxieties about being separated from their parents, and I keep in touch with their parents all throughout the day via pics and videos to make sure that they have no  anxieties as well and can feel secure and enjoy their vacation. | Trying to find someone is impossible for same day because the person books out a day or more Or either that or they are too far. Both excuses the app uses.  Much better service with App 'WAG!'  It’s a great app. | Rover is very user friendly! I love how it gives tips, tricks, and reminders. It is very easy to communicate and send pictures of the animals through the app. Bookings have been very easy as well and I love how you can set your unavailable days. Overall great experience! | We are so glad we found Kana through Rover. Our dog clearly feels at home there, enjoys the other, selected smaller dogs boarding at the same time, the spacious (secure) yard, and Kana’s warm care. Follow instructions to reach their location near Chambers Bay. | I’ve used Rover for years both to find sitters for my dog and to care for dozens of dogs as a sitter.
It provides so many features that make it easy to communicate with pet parents, ensure prompt payments, and really makes being a pet sitter enjoyable without the parts that would otherwise be a hassle or stressful. I can communicate so easily with pet parents and it makes things easy, keeps them private, and I can’t imaging finding or being a sitter without it! | Beware!!!  Rover offers no protection to the people who pet sit through their app. I was injured by an animal during a visit and they do not offer any coverage for the injury. I have pay out of pocket! They only offer coverage for pet overs. I would not recommend this app. | Always professional and trustworthy.  Would always recommend. | Yet every time I click to enter the next section of information , be it on the app or website, everything gets deleted. I’ve entered and entered so many times. My first attempt I created an epic detailed description of my experience and as I clicked to goto the next section it deleted everything. It took me 15 mins to type that all out.. it sounds fun and like something I’d love to do, I love animals of all kinds. But i just can’t keep entering and never getting anywhere with this company. If they ever fix their glitchy technical issues then I’ll try again. For now I’ll have to be content with only my animals to play with and train. Luckily I just adopted two kittens so I’m good, but the extra cash while having fun would’ve been nice. | She watched my husky while I was out of town and made me feel really comfortable while having him there! Sent me lots of pictures and kept me up to date! Will definitely be using her to watch my pup again! | I think Rover is a great way to meet potential clients and find ones that are a good fit for the business I am looking to build. | Thanks Jillion for the amazing job you did watching our babies. We appreciate all the updates and pictures of them while we were away | I used a person from rover to fill in for me as a professional petsitter to cover for 4 visits so I could go to my sons graduation. She was so shady and unethical I couldn’t believe it. She cashed the check in Minnesota dated the date she was supposed to filling in for me!! She claimed the dog bit her ! She sent me two different pictures and told me in two different texts that the bite was in two different places the first place on her hand and the other was on her pelvic bone. What? The picture looked like a mosquito bite or like she pinched her skin. No dog bite I’ve ever seen!! I’ve had a couple myself . That was not a dog bite! Anyone can work for rover! Be sure to always check insurance and bonding insurance They do background check but that doesn’t really qualify them as a petsitter!! Read people’s reviews afrom rover!! They are bad . I would give negative stars if I could .  Use petsitters international. They provide training opportunities for petsitters! Be careful who you hire to care for your animals! | They take a huge chunk of your money, they get paid instantly and take weeks to pay you out. | I had a last minute change to my work schedule which required me to head out of town and no one to watch my pup, so I looked into some boarding options and “Rover” popped up!

Now my pup is able to remain in a familiar environment while someone comes by to check on her (let her out to do her business, feed, and small walk/play time). 

Ever since I’ve used River, even for a few days I’ve seen a dramatic change and benefit in my pups mental health! 

Super grateful for this quick and easy go-to resource! 😀 | Support didn’t care but “find someone else.” I found a company with a brick and mortar thanks to their advice. At a least a business won’t treat me like that. | Rover has made finding a sitter for our sweet Biskit so easy! | This is a fantastic platform to find awesome animal caregivers | Just watched a dog for 2 weeks, rover took 160$ from my pay check… crazy stupid.  If you wanna make easy money use a different app or have the customer pay you outside the app. Rover are thieves. | This app is a good idea on paper but the experience is lacking and the many of the sitters here have no experience actual experience with dogs and are flaky. Which is time consuming trying to find people when you’re on a time constraint. Support team responses remind me of chatGPT and ai bots. They don’t answer questions just send a bunch of gibberish. My issues were never resolved so I’m just leaving the app altogether. | Easy to use app | From the thousands of pet sitters on here and gaining more everyday. I feel the company would be just fine if they brought down the percentage they take out of hard working pay their pet sitters work for.

It should be brought down to 15% at least, ideally 10%

In a perfect world 3% | There was an issue with a dog sitter and when I presented it to Rover it was basically “take it up with the dog sitter.” Obviously you can imagine it didn’t go well. The sitter is allowed to continue to message rude messages and respond hatefully to their reviews (rover pushes you to review the sitter). I sent along the hateful messages to Rover directly. We will see if they do the right thing. | Melinda watched our dog & house and did a wonderful job.  We will definitely use Melinda again if she is available! | If you think about making extra money as a dog sitter this company will charger you $25 for a background check unbelievable people!!!  Like gig workers have extra money to give you guys for your hiring!!! | Don’t pay the fee for the background check.  Sure wish I hadn’t. | Won’t even let me make an account but after reading some bad reviews I guess they’re doing me a favor thanks anyway | I’m a happy Rover gal! I’ve been so lucky to be matched with the nicest people and their wonderful pets! | I’ve had 6 different dogsitters with Rover. Some were average, most were terrible. One of them left my oven on and took off before i came home. Another showed up 3.5 hours late. Another I found needles in my home afterwards. They all had great ratings and reviews which I’d imagine are fake. 

If you’re on a budget then use Rover. If you want good care then use anything else, anything. | The instructions on things are so unclear and trying to get ahold of an actual person who isn’t AI is nearly impossible. I finally did and was hung up on. I’ve been trying to become a pet sitter for almost a month and they wasted my time even though I went through this process a few years ago very easily. Not sure what’s going on now but things have gone downhill. | To be honest, if you’re planning to work with Rover, Do not do it! I just work a month with them taking care a doggy. The total amount was $240 with the fee it was around $220 and that’s it. But my 1099 came with $740, they do not have a phone number or chat where you can complain. I sent many email, and no answers! | Rover’s chat/communication options are horrible. My outside cameras caught one of their sitters tonight punching, kicking, and finally pinning my Boxer puppy to the ground once again to the side of the house once. I am devastated by the way that very innocent and sweet and happy natured dogs were treated today. I submitted a video via Rover support as it was the only option, and I was told that I should hear back from somebody within an hour and that was several hours ago. I do not trust Rover any longer and will be using Wag Walking going forward. | Aurelio & Alessandra are amazing. I have two beagles and one of them is super playful. They helped me to take care of them while we were traveling. They updated me 3 times a day with all details and lots of beautiful pictures, that I saved all of them on my phone. I would highly recommend them and definitely I’ll book them again, if they accept my playful doggies of course 😂 | She seemed like the perfect fit for my cat! Got details and photos every day! | Rover has been a good way of getting customers, not fan of the amount of money that’s considered as a fee, but what I don’t like is the 2 day processing time for the funds.. Cause one you don’t start your process until 2 days after the booking and I have to wait an extra day like what? With y’all taking money out of my bookings and having me to wait 3-4 business days is like ridiculous… | The app and service works great. However, when your service is concluded with a sitter the app requests a tip for the sitter. This is ridiculous because the sitter has already priced their service, and it’s already been paid for by the customer, in advance. 
Tip requests are out of control and it makes the customer feel shame if they don’t tip. I will avoid using Rover as much as I can because I don’t want to be put in the position to have to tip again. | The average pet sitter in my area is $30/hour. Rover uses an outdated algorithm to calculate how much dogsitter gets paid. Most dogwalking/dogsitting should be$15/hour or less but Rover rates are $60/hour.

In addition, the app doesn’t show the dog sitter’s availability or updates it regularly. So you as the owner have to constantly reach out to 20 sitters at a time so you can have options to see who can take care of your furbaby. 

If I could post when I need a sitter and have sitters reach out to me, that would be much easier then getting rejected constantly. That’s not the case for Rover. Rover makes it very difficult for dog owners looking for sitters. | Such a Wonderful App!
Yay for ROVER | This service is a lifesaver for people that like to travel and other options become unavailable. I’m using it for the second time in the near future, but so far so good. | I’ve found a really great care giver for my dogs, they are always happy to see her, she meets their needs and everybody has fun.
While the APP is well integrated into the process of finding care givers, scheduling and booking visits.
The option to repeat the schedule from the first day of a booking on subsequent days rarely works for me as the first day of my bookings is almost always different than other days.
It would be great if the option copy from the first day was changed to copy from the previous day. | The app is extremely buggy recently. It drains the battery to nothing every time I’m on a walk and I have the iPhone 14 Pro…also every time I get one message, the app shows 22 messages…so buggy 
Rover, please don’t lay off all your engineers yet, the app is almost unusable at this point!! | I love the easy app. I’ve been very happy with all the dog boarding and dog walkers. I would recommend to anyone. | Definitely a life saver!",4.88794,434408,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/2a/04/ed/2a04ed62-9ec0-3268-5ad6-269ce618a428/ca2ed236-126c-459a-aa5f-67ef69fe04bd_SCREEN_1_-_iOS_-_En_US_-_Older_iPhones.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d9/aa/5b/d9aa5ba4-6774-da0d-240b-a1b032238ad6/dba40a13-dcec-48f1-9c9a-9242d70b83d5_SCREEN_2_-_iOS_-_En_US_-_Older_iPhones.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7a/fb/5f/7afb5f34-28f5-82f1-ca7b-59679fddecca/c827f448-2579-4295-8bd9-a7d225385403_SCREEN_3_-_iOS_-_En_US_-_Older_iPhones.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0f/59/0b/0f590b5c-e229-bfdb-094a-c24f8ac3badb/f6136e86-5e91-4d77-9efb-9e33869847be_SCREEN_4_-_iOS_-_En_US_-_Older_iPhones.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/41/63/ed/4163ed3b-6111-3ecd-660e-3a8c96bcf27f/0afe7c88-dd92-4e1e-b61e-f0d24b9ad1ae_SCREEN_5_-_iOS_-_En_US_-_Older_iPhones.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/83/8b/f3/838bf323-e421-80f3-b11c-161b42aedfe4/5f1c37f2-bdce-409b-bd85-a9bfc02d17cb_SCREEN_6_-_iOS_-_En_US_-_Older_iPhones.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d9/88/2b/d9882b87-77af-b6c7-c501-9a08fd573ddf/0ae4ab9a-283c-4868-82a0-88527b812b6f_SCREEN_7_-_iOS_-_En_US_-_Older_iPhones.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Says I’ve hit a snag | Great food tonight and superb table servers Armando and Jess.  2 thumbs up! | I have been trying to purchase a dining package for several months now. You send me notifications about sales, but I cannot buy the meal package. 
I just read about the crown and anchor group, but there’s no where to join, and no information as to wether it’s free or costs to join. No mention of what it costs, if anything. | App is confusing to navigate. I feel like it doesn’t give you much information. | It seems this app was designed without thought to usability. 
This app is useless for scheduling events on larger ships, unless you plan your time to the minute weeks ahead. You will be presented with options for events that are sold out, then make you to go all the way through the process to book the event, then end with a generic error.
Obviously the information about capacity is available, since Royal Caribbean guest services knows this information, but apparently the app only access it at checkout, then presents a generic “something went wrong” error.
Annoying feature #2, this has a messaging feature so you can stay in touch with your party. EXCEPT, there are no push notifications. Am I really expected to have the app open and constantly monitoring the app for messages? Literally learn push notifications, | App not so easy to get around 
Could not show completed when we answered all questions | Attempted to check in and the app is glitchy.  Would not allow check in and couldn’t find some passengers info. | Says there available, went to add to cart now it’s gone | The waiter and service was excellent specially Noriel  the waiter & Fan the assistant. Great food … | I would like to see a question and answer section. Some things are a little hard to find on the app if you are not a seasoned traveler. | Does pretty much everything one would need while on board. Just got off a Mostly Slow Cruise and that app seemed like stone age compared to the royal app. That was when it would actually function. Every time I would attempt to use it I would have no connection and would have to log in again. What a pain. | APP is very glitchy!!! | You can eventually find most things you’re looking for but the app is not user friendly or very intuitive.   Must go down too many blind alleys before finding desired information. | Why is no dining offers presented? | Hard to make payments | Miguel Taylor’s the Dining Room Manager, Jean Paul the Head Waiter, Lee Ann our Lead Waitress and her Assistant Paresh were “ALL” the Dream Team of the Food & Beverage Department on board the Adventure of the Seas.

P.P.S. As for the Housekeeping Department five Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️ goes to Hajje Reotutar who like magic made our room never interfering or interrupting with our daily schedule.

God Bless 🙏 you and “ALL” your families! | I believe that a high school student taking a computer science class could develop a more straightforward and intuitive site than this app. | Crown and anchor points update | I have a iPhone 7+.  I cannot update to the IOS version that the new update supports.  I therefore cannot use the app at all.  Please fix it. | The app is hard to navigate. It could be a little more user friendly. | Mediocre app. Does not let me login. And tech-support will not respond back. I’m able to login on the website, but not in the app and the website does not allow me to check in. | Can’t add 2 passes to the same Apple Wallet. App allows you to check in 2 people traveling together but only allows adding a single (primary) pass to the Apple Wallet. | Hard to find arrival/leaving times | I cannot see the payment details. I am always locked out. Worst app ever. I cannot add internet or beverage packages at the 35% as advertised the app only shows 20%. I just won’t purchase anything additional. | The latest app update has stopped anyone with an iPhone that is an iPhone 13 or older from using it. iPhone 13 or earlier do not support iOS 17. Which is required to use the app. I now cannot use the app on my older iPhone. Customer service said so sad, get a new phone | I have tried numerous times to update the Royal Caribbean app that I have, but I just go round and around and there is no update, mI have tried deleting it and then adding it in and I get a message that I will get the older version.  What is going on here?  This is so frustrating! | I’m unable to see anything I have to log on the website very weird | Enjoyed the cruise choices from different ports. The activities offered. No complaints | Not happy with this 17 only upgrade as now I can’t sign in my phone won’t update to 17 15 only. Cruise Dude | No problems yet. Been getting good results so far | Is absolutely, ridiculous!
The customer service is absolutely a nightmare!
I can’t even understand them.
The sounds breaks down.
It is all about saving money 
The least amount of human contact | The app no longer works on my phone. Since the required update, it will not update with my iPhone 14. | I have an iPhone X, and app locked up stating I need to do an upgrade of the app in the App Store. When I tried, it stated app only supports iOS 17.0. My phone won't update newer than 16.7.7. I'm not getting a new phone just to go on the cruise so RC can tell me about the cruise! | Why is the app continually asking me to upgrade to iOS 17? My phone just upgraded to 16.77? How is this supposed to work? | Why so many | New APP is available for IOS17.0 or newer. I love the upgrades, however not enough to have to purchase a new phone!! | When I open the app, a message appears saying an update is needed.  So I go to the App Store to obtain an update.  It directs me back to the app.  It’s a loop that I can’t get out of.  Deleted the app and started over.  Same thing.  Very frustrating.  The app used to be user friendly.  Now it is a nightmare. | I am trying to add the app to my iPad. When I try to open it says go visit the App Store for an update. At th App Store there isn’t anything to click on to complete the update. The iPad has the latest update version. 
Any ideas? Help | Every part of this reservation has been so easy and smooth thank you | Can’t find where I click to update this app.  I can’t use the app unless I update. Old people don’t use technology well.  I’m very frustrated | I like the excursion info and onboard activities, but I’d like an overview of my ship and its itinerary. As in, days/times of arrival and departures of particular ports. | I can not update the app because my phone is too old. | How am I supposed to pay for it | IS AMAZING! | Am scheduled to cruise on Jewel of the Seas and couldn’t be more frustrated. Not only have reserved excursions been canceled, there are no excursions posted for Scotland to date.  Also the itinerary has changed from when we initially booked the cruise. Seriously considering canceling everything. | RC’s app seems better designed for the vendor than the customer. Info to sell the user more stuff is easy to find. Info that is important to the customer? Not so much. What’s my reservation number? Don’t use this app to find out. What’s the ship’s itinerary? Sorry, the app can’t help you with dates and times. But buying over priced drink packages? No problem! With all the money RC rakes in, upgrading their app to help paying customers should be a priority. | The app is awful I expect more from RC.  It pits me in a bad mood when I have to use it on the cruise.  Needs a complete redo.  I’ve sailed same week for years and I have to put in my address??? Come on man.  At least get you data entry fields linked up with IOS so I don’t have to type everything.  It’s really bad functionality and design horrible. | I have an older phone and am not able to update due to my apple software not being up to date. You need to make it to where people are still able to access the app. | RC updated their app but it only works on newer phones | I have not been able to complete the checkin process on my app. After entering my pass port information, the only response I have gotten is “oops, we hit a snag, try back later”.

Update the app to the latest version so you can have the best experience!","4.3.1",0,"USD",true,371186060,"Chevron U.S.A.

Complete rip off | So a cancelled transaction resulted in a $150 authorization that tied up my available credit for 8 days! I called Amex, they blamed Chevron, and here, Chevron is blaming Amex! | La mejor | Me gusta más asi | At this time, when it’s too expensive to even buy groceries, Chevron saved me $1.00 per gallon filling up. Not once or twice, but three times. 🥰 Thank you Chevron! Y’all ROCK! ❤️ | Nice app | “This pump has stopped working” displayed on the screen and my transaction was canceled.  Of course they took all my points away and only pumped a quarter tank of gas.  Don’t fall for the rewards discount…. You’ll rack up points spending 5 dollars a gallon, and when you need to use then something like this happens.  Back to Costco for me…. At least they don’t scam you with expensive gas prices and fake rewards. | Paid for my gas without having to get out of my car, Wow Great app | Si soy un hombre feliz gracias chevron | This was so easy to set up so easy to use on my first try and such a fantastic way to get gas. Thank you I will definitely be using this app every time | Been awhile since I️ shared this and no updates I️ checked settings and the app is enabled for cellular. But whether on cellular or WiFi. “Please check your network connection and try again” Too bad. Seems to have many positive reviews. Perhaps they don’t have an iPhone 14.

Went into the Support section.  And only there does it share that an update is available 

Applied it and I️ ‘m kind of in.  

Entered phone number. 
Got a text.  
Apple pasted the Code into the field and then

Nothing. 

On iOS 17.4.1. | These rewards are the best rewards | Steve was the service man at the gas station and he helped me complete. My Chevron rewards that I had only used once before and Ed completed payment and he walked me through the whole thing took his time. He did help other people in the process and he was amazing very friendly. I give him five stars. You need to hire more people like himand even though that is a gas station that’s further from my home. I will make a point to go there when he’s working again. Steve is amazing. It’s the Chevron next to Winco in Medford, OR 97504. I think 41. | Works great, works with Apple car play and Apple. Pay. No paper recipes, no hassles, just pull up to pump and fuel up. | Nice feature to pay from Apple Pay | This app is great, love it | App is getting better, but it still will mal-function at the pump about 15% of time - and you never hear back from Support! | Pump took a $150 authorization that didn’t come my account for 7 days!!! | Fast, easy! | Very easy app and love the rewards especially given the gas prices these days! | I loved this app when it first came out. All of the changes have made the app worse with each change. I get different errors every time. Too many to list. This is the only app that has totally locked up on my iPhone 14. That's just one of many errors. It's so bad now that it no longer works. I have tried 4 different stations over several weeks and didn't get it to work once. And when it did work it had gotten very inconvenient to use. They should scrap the app, since they don't support it, and just allow us to use a pay app that works. 2023 update: The app is worthless now. I spent 2 minutes in the car entering phone number, waiting for PIN, and then entering special code. I can make transactions with my financial institutions with face ID - not good enough for Chevron. I pushed ""fuel up"" and waited. And waited. While I was waiting I used my card. App never did anything except error out. | Nice n easy | I think it is a good app but what would make it be more than good is if I can select the exact dollar amount to pay at the pump! | Everybody should pump the gas through this app it so easy and fast!! | Very convenient | Took my points, Took my money. They’re saying gas was $4 last month here in Houston because they don’t want to admit they're wrong. Don’t even know why i waste valuable time trying to beg for reward points i earned. In a Lose-Lose situation | Works great! Excellent! I love it! | La manera de ahorrar dinero con esa App | The app itself is ok. It did have a bad glitch that made me lose points. But overall nice interface. 
The Filipino customer service representatives are awful. | Muy bien 👍 | So far so good I got to learn how to get more points but other than that is good | This app is so easy to use and really helps in making the transaction effortless! | Best quality gas, and I love saving 10 c to $1 per gallon | When signing in, the app won’t go past the “Enter the code we sent to (xxx) xxx-xxxx.” When code is entered, it simply sits there doing nothing. If I request a new code and type it in, same thing happens. ⛽️ | Love this app so convenient | Buena opción | Even though we use our Chevron card on the app, it is cheaper to not use app. If we use the Chevron credit card on the pump, we get cash price and rewards.  This seems wrong. | As a single parent it’s hard to get my kids unloaded and re loaded into the vehicle to go inside and pay plus this comes with savings | Nice reward system | Excelente aplicación | The reward first time is limited to 25 gallons | La mejor estación de gasolin.
The best Gas Station | I had my other account locked for over a month, called the help desk so may times was to told the app team would call they very did. I filled up so many times not receiving points. Finally I deleted the account and used a new phone number. | De 3 descuentos por la app de chevron solo me dieron 2 | I was curious on how to use this but was very sople all you have to do is add your card or even Apple Pay so you don’t have to add your card and then it will check the chevron location you are at it will ask for your number your at and it will ask you to pay so you don’t have to go inside and it also takes a $1 off each gallon when you use the app | Excellent work",4.88816,186479,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/1e/b9/5a/1eb95a71-6445-b9e1-6ae5-4224063cd646/f56fed79-3f66-41ca-b75e-5f856fe50212_ios_chev_small_1-1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/39/54/fe/3954fe30-52f7-1c4b-1b09-6903ff9ade19/836b4af3-f075-4431-98f3-e1b88bd8ec2c_ios_chev_small_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/3b/09/35/3b093554-e15e-6d02-aae0-bf4d57d433f3/23d6c4cb-51e5-4128-8d89-db44f468d8a2_ios_chev_small_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/63/82/f7/6382f706-10cc-d474-16e7-364ef59e5267/6817d618-087b-4706-a23b-df60edaaa5f7_ios_chev_small_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/40/7e/5a/407e5a93-0d47-0b74-c9dd-35ea55ba6405/ba62705e-ff2c-4ec6-bbf0-5dbb802d612b_ios_chev_small_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/8d/91/4e/8d914e1e-dc01-2452-7548-0f225f8b10f7/b75ec91c-2244-407b-85d4-241cc9f11124_ios_chev_small_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I set our various hotels as “home” as we changed cities and then put in places we wanted to visit. We would get various routes using public transportation all the way to turn-by-turn walking routes. I actually carried around an external battery because we could not function without this. You can use it in the USA or any major city in the world. This is well worth the tiny monthly charge for each vacation to take! | The moovit I remember is gone and replaced with an ad-beast that prioritizes uber and taxi, instead of the actual means of transportation I’d use the app for: buses and metro railways… | Indispensable! | Great app, help me schedule is always on time. | Es una importante ya que ofrece ubic ación exacta del trasporte y te mantiene informado . | La mayor de las veces muy a tiempo | Excellent tool box In your finger tips | So far so good | The app/service is pretty good. Some of the times on screen can be pretty confusing but once you’ve got it down I find it to be pretty reliable. However it’s got one major annoyance. I upgraded to Moovit+ so I wouldn’t get ads (and to support the app) and now it’s ad-free but I still get annoying popups to upgrade to Moovit+. They always seem to pop up at the most inopportune time. I’ve waited months of updates to see if they fix this but apparently it’s as-designed. | שרות מעולה ומדויק בזמן | Never show the right time ,I miss bus bcz the time is wrong . Plus make me drop off to get back across the street on the same bus . | So many fucxing annoying ads you can barely use the app even if you want  to get a subscription - give a break 7 ads in 1 minute it’s ridiculous!
Website is Horrible you go online and ask it not to use the app and it still open the app ???
Please get a new web guy. 
Anyway it will be the last time trying to use the app. | Extremely useful. Worth the premium subscription. | Catch my train on time | This app has helped me get to where I’m going with ease and info 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 | То что надо | Ok yes | Due to my truck being stolen, I find myself catching septa again in almost 37 years and needed to see a bus scheduled.  Google led me to the Moovit app and I am so surprised how easy and informative this app is ! | Love this app. Very accurate and I use it daily. | The bus schedule need to be fix some stops only showing buses. I have been using the app for for 2 years . 

Please go over certain stops and fix it because recently . I have been using a different app to move around. 

I can’t say to anyone to download this app for help because it’s not 100% at times ! 

As you can see I still give a 5 star but do better ! | ممتاز جدا هذا التطبيق ، very good | This app freezes a lot and is not user friendly. | Gracias 🙏 | This app has saved me lots of time and very accurate with times it could use a little tweaks like maybe letting you know when there will be a change in your route or construction going on | We started using the app in Cuenca, Ecuador and realized it was just as up to date and helpful in Madrid when we visited recently. Great job. | better than Muni | Es excelente la aplicación le ayuda mucho a las personas a ubicarse es | Pros:
Accuracy is better than other apps
Good available info

Cons:
- Street names on dark mode are hard to read, - bus stop white dots are sometimes covered, and I need to see all stops so I can count the number of stops since buses here do not announce stop names 
- icons for bus stops and live location of buses is inconsistent and sometimes uses the same icon… the icon of a bus
- map keeps recentering to starting point when I’m trying to pan around on the map to see other stops | I pay for a yearly subscription and have always been “blocked” when I try to do ANYTHING. | I am delivered | Really, the best way to find out everything around my city off Boston mass | We use this app every time we traverse a metro in large cities. So far works in multiple countries! I tell our friends it is the most accurate and easy to use app for public trasportation. | pretty sure this is an apple store violation too, but stop trying to disguise your ads and offers by using notifications.

i don't want them. i don't want you clogging notifications, beeping and bugging me. stop.

notifications should be for things related to trips i'm taking, period. nothing else. | App locations settings don’t work well. UI is extremely and needlessly complicated | Nice | Najbolja aplikacija za prevoz | Moovit is a must in israel. It gets me around town all the time. It’s accurate and very timely in determining how to move around town. Absolutely a great app. | No complaints | Smart and excellent gps.I recommend this to my friends and to all people I know. | This is the best app for if you just moved to
Vegas and need reliable transportation. I love this app!!! I use it everyday since I moved out here. You just put in the address and it’ll show you multiple bus routes/options to get to your destination. | Very helpful when your getting to work. | I tended to use their free version a few times a month. I appreciated their service and was considering paying for the ad free version. The free version now provides a perfect simulation of a viral infection. Endless popups and other distractions, autofill-ins when you don’t want it and end with a frozen screen…After what they are willing to allow free users to experience, I want nothing to do with them and won’t give them a penny. | כשמפעילים את האפליקציה - זה שולח ישר פרסומות ואז במקום ללחוץ על התחל נסיעה חדשה, זה מקפיץ לפרסומת - גרם לי כמעט להפסיד רכבות, צריך להפסיק את זה | Pretty much it’s great but the only thing Is when you have it in a route and you switch over to like say a call and you back to the app to see like what’s the next bus or line your taking and it resets so you got to punch the address again and wait til it loads thats the only thing wrong with it and the ads which is stupid but it’s cool if you have the paitience | :/ | It Amazing app

So idk abt the workouts but love it💞🤷‍♀️ | When I downloaded lemon8, it asked me for my birthdate and I put the wrong year in and it will not let me past the screen. | People literally post hundreds of anti-LGBTQ posts without any consequences. These include hate speech, harassment, etc. Literally the worst moderated app ever | if i could give this 0 stars i would, but i can’t. i was born 2011 and the app CLEARLY states 12+ and i am 12, it kept saying “Sorry your not eligible for Lemon8…..but thanks for checking us out!” i give this a lemon1 star☠️ | I would rate 0 if I could | Im 16 but it’s not letting me download the app because apparently i’m not of age? | It allows me to do what I feel and be my self | I habe tried multiple times to make an account but it won't let me put my birthday in it bc it says im not eligible even though I'm 16 | This app is amazing a lot of posts can give you help and tips and its like if instagram and Pinterest had mixed which was like amazing and also theres a lot of interesting things to see of others posting | I keep seeing reviews about underage minors complaining about the age for this app. If you are UNDER 18 this app IS. NOT. FOR. YOU. point blank period. This app is not for 12 and 13 year olds, this app is for adults I’m sorry 🤷🏻‍♀️ | Frequently one would like to zoom in on instructions.   Print is too small | I am 15 and I try to sign in and I can’t I keep trying and I can’t so idk how to do it | I am a 13 year old female about to be 14 and I downloaded this app because I have heard good things about it. I was wrong when I downloaded I was exited to learn healthy new recipes for healthy food but when I typed in my DOB it said I did not meet the age requirement and it made me VERY DISAPPOINTED. | I don't think this app is going anywhere soon. It's ok. A mix of the TikTok and Instagram design, which makes sense since it's the same company over at TikTok, but it still feels confusing. Hopefully they're able to catch up and fix the design to make it smoother and easier to navigate and look at things just like TikTok is. | I tried to put in my age and birthdate, but it says I’m not eligible to use this app. I am old enough to have this app i’m not understanding why i can’t use it. | I hate this app. Do not get it. I am 15 years old and I put in my date of birth and it did not let me into the app. I don’t know why it didn’t let me in because I’m over the age of 12 and this made me so mad | I love this app. It’s like Pinterest and Tik Tok on one | So I am 12+ and I went to put in my date of birth and it would not let me in it said I’m not eligible for lemon8 but I’m 12 plus so I did not even get to use the app | I have to go | I loved lemon8 when I first got it. I went viral for the first time ever! I was so happy I posted more and more. Only for my account to be banned because I’m underage.. I'm 13
And never showed my full face because I’m all for protecting myself. I appealed and I have no idea what went wrong but it said denied. I used my military card because I don’t have an id yet because in my state you have to 14. I would love to get my account back. And will not be making a new one and starting over because I see no reason why if I’m just gonna get banned again. | Earlier this week I tryed download this app because I saw it on Pinterest and thought it looked cool, after downloading I put in my birthday and I am over 12 so I thought there would be no problem but it did end up telling me I did not meet the age requirement for the app like multiple other reviews said. I continue to try downloading the app and putting in my info for the next 2-3 days intill it finally worked, so I would say keep trying and it should eventually work. Also, this app is very fun very similar to instagram and Pinterest and is age appropriate. | It says in not eligible but it’s 12+ and I’m 16 and it won’t let me. Please help me?? | The app age says 12+ right? Anyways so I had lemon8 on my old
Phone so I was getting on my new phone and I put in my age which meets the age limit but it keeps saying not eligible for lemon8 but I am when I could get it on my old
Phone so i don’t know if this is a bug or what… | Cool | Only one problem I really have with this app is that the age requirement says 12+ which I am I’m literally 12 but every time I put in my age which is 12 and I put my birthday October 11 and yeah it doesn’t work so I try to put myself like 30 years old. It doesn’t work 18 years old doesn’t work. This app is really good so far as i saw on TikTok I really need to get my life together and this app can really help. I just really want this app to fix this problem because it says 12+ and I am 12 and I even tried to put myself like 18 years. Old 30 years old does not work. I deleted the app and reinstalled it doesn’t work still.please fix this problem please | I LOVEE LOVE LOVEEE THE LEMON 8 APP THERE IS JUST SO MUCH INSPO ON IT AND VERY NICE PEOPLE THAT HELP YOU OUT ALSO I LOVE HOW YOU CAN DECORATE YOUR POSTS AND EVERYONE IS SUPPORTIVE AND THERE IS NO HATE THANK YOU SO MUCH LEMON 8! | The age in the App Store says 12 plus but I’m now 13 and I put in my birthday and it says I’m not eligible enough for lemon8 😡 this has made me very upset and I will not be giving a good review. | It say it’s for age 12 and up how come I’m 14 and it say that m not eligible for the app? | I saw this app on tiktok Pinterest and my siblings and I thought why not give it a try? Well I made a big mistake, I am twelve years old and I put my birthday as a twelve year old and it it apparently didn’t match with the guidelines, which makes me very confused because the app age says twelve years +, anyways I thought it was just a glitch so I tried it again and it was still the same, I gave up ten minutes later and decided to stick with Pinterest for now on. | Lemon8 is just built different!!!!!!!!! | I’m 16 years old and very time I try to get this app it says my birthday and year are no wrong no matter what I do! Idk what to do I tried downloading and deleting it for hours and days at a time and it is still not working!!! | So I put my real birthday and it says it’s is for ages 12 and up and I did not meet the age sto | it didn’t let me sign in the app because it says am to young but on the app its says 12+ and am 16 years old | Hey So this app is really good for inspiration and ideas etc but it isn’t letting me login and others also I am over 12 which is the age requirement it say 12+ but it’s not letting me and I’m over 12 so please Lemon8 fix this bug glitch for us people that want to use the app 🙏🙏 thank you so much Lemon8 | Wow this app is great I helps me so much!! I'm so happy I downloaded 🍋8 (lemon8) | so i’m old enough for the app and i tried to get it but it says im ineligible?? im old enough so why?? i really wanted to get it but i cant even get into the app. please fix this? why is it 12+ when its not? | This app is so cool and fun I love it 🩷 | It keeps say log in not eligible and I put my bday and and it said my acc was banned and I only posted 4 thing a and I read the guide lines so Idrk.. | I am 15 and the app says 12+ but when I type my age into the app it says not eligible. I have tried to reset the app and offload it but it still says that when I press continue. | I just got the app lemon8 and when I got into the app I put my birthday in. I am over 12 and put the year I was born in and pressed continue and it wouldn’t work. It said connection unavailable please try again later. So I put 5 years before I was born. Still wouldn’t work. I have tried multiple times and won’t let me continue. Hopefully the owner of the app sees and will fix this, I don’t recommend this app, it is the exact same thing as Pinterest. | I downloaded this app for me to think that it’s gonna be a replica version of Pinterest but when I picked what I wanted to be on my “Featured” it was a terrible experience for me I dod not find anything that had me wanting to keep scrolling through the app very disappointing… | Wouldn’t let me chose my own age I tried everything and it did not work someone fix this app. | So I got this app and when I opened it for the first time, it didn’t let me in even though I met the age requirement and I put in my real birthday. | Please fix your age restriction glitch, there’s no point in having the app if I can’t use it at all. | This is like IG but better ! My best friend put me on and now I can’t stop talking about it. I suffer from major depression and creative block. There’s something Bout the prompts to keep me constantly engaged, I really appreciate. | So I’m 12+ and it looks like a really good app but it says I’m not eligible even tho I’ve been putting in my year and birthday correctly and it’s so annoying | So I downloaded this app can I put in my birthday and then but it won’t let me do it and I’m old enough I’m older than 12 so fix your game | It has

It’s really sad to see companies become this way, they add a fee for every little thing now. Before if a payment failed on a card they would automatically use the backup card on file, now they let the failed payment sit there and charge you a $5 fee (even if you pay it immediately) then $2 for everyday it’s late! That’s insane! I have a credit card I can add immediate funds to that gives me points and helps build my credit so I use it for the initial payment most of the time and then my usual debit card for follow up payments so normally it was never an issue, now they make me feel like I’m someone that can’t manage my bills and so they need to “punish” me for it, like calm down Sezzle you are not a credit card company…although even they would give more grace. I’m so disappointed in this company, I’ll just stick to Klarna, at least they only added a $2 service fee I would much rather deal with. Do better Sezzle! | I guess someone else has used my number | So the only way you can use this stupid app at any store you would actually want to shop at is if you give these people $12 a month, no thanks I’ll just use affirm or PayPal. | It doesn’t work whenever I try to use it. It let me use it in store which is why I got it then when I went to do it it took it away. Every feature disappears | I love Sezzle because unlike other afterpay services like PayPal/ karma/afterpay/ affirm it lets you buy ammo and firearms. Keeping America Safe. | I’ve used Sezzle going on three years now and I’m very disappointed on how it’s turned out. I loved the app due to being able to make big purchases then paying it off in 4 payments. However, recently the app requires you to pay $18 for a membership in order to place orders at the stores I used to make orders before. All of sudden I must be approved and even then I can’t make a purchase because I don’t want to pay an additional $18 a month to use Sezzle at any store. This app is not worth your time anymore. Corporations just can’t help their greed can they? I wish I could give them -1 stars. It’s truly ridiculous. | I truly believe Sezzle is a good app and if they actually held up their end of Advertisment and the Pay Anywhere actually ment anywhere I’d give them 5 stars but it doesn’t. 2nd there is no form of problem solving/no help line & customer service is non existent, no system in place to help with issues that may arise. | The reason why I rated Sezzle two stars is because when Sezzle first came out, it started off great! it used to be my primary pay for method and it was so easy to get my limit raised as long as I was making my payments on time. I felt so good about Sezzle. I got my limit to $2100...HOWEVER after making on-time payments for over a year, my limit was reduced to $200 out of nowhere. None of the representatives could explain to me why it happened. I got the same robotic response every single time I spoke with somebody about it. They said ""as long as you make your payments on time or early your limit won't be reduced."" Majority of my payments that I made with Sezzle were early payments and others on time!!!, somehow my limit was reduced significantly... That was extremely disappointing. Sezzle also came out with a premium subscription. That was a great way to use it in different ways and with different merchants it was an annual fee which lots of people loved... HOWEVER THEY TOOK AWAY THE PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION AND NOW I HAVE A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE INSTEAD OF JUST PAYING $80 A YEAR. THEY ARE FORCING THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PAY $17.99 A MONTH TO USE SEZZLE ANYWHERE.... ZIP has now become my new Sezzle because at least with Zip I don't have to pay a monthly fee to use it anywhere and my limit isn't reduced out of nowhere. | I use Sezzle for groceries mostly and Let me tell you that Sezzle has gotten me out of some rough times!! When I was down to my last $20 I was able to get more with the help of Sezzle!! I recommend Sezzle to everyone now! I also use SezzleUp to help build up my credit as it reports back to credit karma! I also now am subscribed to Anywhere Sezzle! | Don’t waste your time with Sezzle. Affirm is far more giving and convenient. Sezzle is just an autogenerated limit that is is ridiculous compared To any other quick loan app. I’d trust a random email from another country before using Sezzle | The best app ever love love love | I will give an honest review based upon my experience with this app. I’m starting out with a gutt feeling that I will delete. | These guys were there for me when l needed to purchase an item in an emergency thank you so so much for all of your help and support 2 thumbs up | I’ve used Sezzle for years with more and more stores to choose from over that time has made Sezzle a favorite when online shopping | Sezzle is absolutely unlike Afterpay or any other pay as you go app, they all need perfect credit to be useful, Sezzle and zip are the 2 apps that give you a chance and you make it work and then they will make it work, so if you need an app to help or want to build credit Sezzle is a must have for anyone who wants more then 50$ to work with | Great tool! | Sezzle use to be one of a kind. I had the highest spending limit the ability to use anywhere at any store with just a tap. I stopped using AfterPay and Klarna and just used Sezzle. They recently changed their pay anywhere process where you have to now get every purchased approved. So the convenience factor is gone. They approved me with the highest spending limit even though my credit was not that great. introduced a tier based system that really doesn’t give you anything to want to spend I completed that tier with 20 on time spending streak within a couple of weeks and instead of any type
Of reward my spending power was dropped even though there have been no late payments, my credit is higher than it was, and I use the card continuously. Now my spending power is less than what I owe and every payment I make does not allow me an option to spend bc I’m over. Just like I did with AfterPay after paying and Klarna being unprofessional I’m done with the Pay-in-4s and back to credit cards. It was good while it lasted! | I absolutely love this app. It’s so easy to use and it’s easy to maintain. Thank goodness for Sezzel❣️❣️❣️ | All about charging you for everything. Using a card? Fee. Wanna shop here? Fee. Error running a card? Fee. Paying this last one off and deleting the app. | This app is terrible!! StubHub is an app that on the sizzle app and they keep sayin the virtual card is not available to purchase with this merchant. How does that make sense 🤦🏾‍♂️ | So when I downloaded the app I had a $550 limit, then 2 days later got an email that my limit was increased to 1300. The next day it was lowered to 100 then later the same day it’s sitting at 250. So it has no consistency and seems extremely arbitrary. Will be deleting when have paid off my 3 $25 payments. | Had Sezzle for 2 years. Decreased spending from $350 to $200. Cancelled my premium. Spebd limit is now $50. | I used to enjoy using this service because I could pay for in-store purchases in installments every now and then. Now they’re asking us to pay $17.99 PER MONTH to be able to use the in-store feature?? What a joke. I didn’t even know I had to pay extra until after I tried to make a purchase. Would’ve been nice to know that beforehand. Slowly but surely, people will start to take notice and stop using the app altogether. Myself included. It’s ridiculous. | This app used to be good til now that it’s asking you to pay a membership fee to shop. It used to let me shop at target with no issues and now I can’t til I pay a membership. I’m good thank you | Still waiting for them to give me back my 1k spending limit. I have purchases that are $400 and more  then I went to get another purchase and they put me back down to $200 spending limit. I paid everything on time and they put me back down to a $200 limit. Very upset but what can I do except not use them until it goes back up | This App has saved my rear end so many times on needed but couldn’t afford purchases . So easy to work with. I recommend it highly! | Payed for premium and just kept getting orders declined, don’t waste your time with thieves who take your money and don’t even do their end. Better to use it on something better. | I loved this app when it first came out and was using it primarily with Target. But to move it in the premium subscription is ridiculous, I am not going to pay to get extra access. I will be paying off what I have left and deleting this app. Not worth it Afterpay, Klarna and Zip are much better. | I had let my premium subscription lapse, now I can’t get it back and this app is utterly useless without it.  No stores I would ever want to shop in.  If I can’t get premium back why bother keeping it. | Not use this app. Don’t give them your banking information. They are currently in a class action suit in California but not non-disclosure of information pertaining to banking. They also are allowing you to get Lyft gift cards and allowing scammers to use that gift card information to divert your Lyft ride and cause your Lyft account to be suspended when you report that you’re not in the car. DO NOT USE IT ITS A SCAMMER BREEDING GROUND | In the beginning, I absolutely loved Sezzle and have been using it for a well over a year now but most recently they’ve decreased my spending limit with no explanation as my payments are on time or early. | Worst app to hit the market. Terrible customer service and they flat out take your money. Paid 95 towards a gift card and I can’t even use it. | Sezzle is great to have for so many reasons . 

Perhaps you want a new wardrobe and the hubby says no, so you Sezzle and pay monthly and he’ll never know . 

Maybe your low on money and your several days away from a payday. 

It’s much better than credit cards. You don’t have that crazy interest . You pay in 4 payments. | I love it! Sezzle is a wonderful service and very Convenient for Rescheduling payments! Thanks Sezzle! | Used to be able to make Target purchases before this new ""Membership"" thing started. Always paid on time and even recommended the app to several friends. But now I have to pay on top the payments I'm already making? Nope. I'm done with this app. Trash.

Update: App Dev is blatantly lying. Stating that upgrading to membership is optional while that is true, I specified that I used the Target site within the app. Which I can no longer use. | They want to charge you 12.99 dollars just to shop at stores that should already be included for free. At least make it 10 dollars.All the other apps that are like this don’t charge you for this. | Honestly used to love Sezzle. They’ve never taken my limit down and never overcharged me. It hasn’t been until recently that I’ve started hating this app. I can’t contact customer service and then come back like they say. The conversation disappears. I receive emails but can’t seem to send anything back to them. Seems really terrible for someone just trying to get some help. This is a major flaw and honestly enough to make me not use it anymore. If I can’t contact customer service and stay in contact after I leave to app like they say I can, then what’s the point in “support”. Took the associate 4 mins to respond to me and by then the conversation was gone and had started a new one. There was no way for me to get my questions answered, no way to get help. I email back since that’s the only option I had and apparently that didn’t work as she emailed me back saying she’s stepping away as I hadn’t responded. Seriously a big let down. Would give it no stars if I could right now. | I’ve used a number of other similar services and will never use this one again. I somehow got signed up for premium without knowing it and wouldn’t have known had I not read an email from them that could easily have gotten lost in the shuffle. I had to download the app in order to cancel my subscription (couldn’t do it online). The app was buggy and took awhile for me to navigate the cancellation process because it wasn’t working well. 

Use AfterPay or other services if possible. | This is a terrible app. It says I am verified and approved and have $300 spending power, yet everytime I try to shop it says it can not approve me because it can not verify me!!! I have used numerous pay in four apps before and my credit rating is 640, so there is no reason why I should not be able to use this. Delete!! | Difficult and expensive app to use.
Not worth the money or the time.
Wouldn’t recommend. | Love shopping with this app | Sezzle was great for a while but with this new update, you can’t use it ANYWHERE! Has left me in a bind multiple times. About to delete and never use again. | it could be so good; Do NOT make payments on time or you will be penalized, denied use of services, your account will be locked or closed or when going to use available spend, they will say ‘unable to verify your identity’.. huh?? (this is all AFTER you’ve used their virtual card before and have verified all your info lol). It’s like you are penalized for making your payments ON TIME; as others have stated - it’s just truly mind boggling. Their AI model just randomly closes accounts - it’s just so strange. I had to ask for a refund of their premium service as after the first time I used my available credit for gas, successfully, (twice mind you), I was locked out of using my available spend with two payments on time. It’s As if they WANT you to be late with payments,, so they can make more by selling off your debt if you DON’T pay the money you owe them! Just bizarre! NOTE: Seems a trend with BNPL- that often you ARE penalized for actually making on time or early payments or paying balances in full. Someone needs do a model report and research on this across the BNPL apps! Just bizarre! | Truly wanted to get this jacket it is so beautiful.. But I could not pay for it all at once. But Sezzle made it possible for me and I’m so very grateful.. Paid All of my Sezzle Loans,, Thank you Sezzle | I’m paying monthly to use sezzle anywhere and I used to be able to do it via apple pay while out right then and there. Now I have to do a purchase request and hold up lines and wait for it to get approved. What’s the point of the monthly fee now? Please fix this and get rid of it. Sincerely, ALL OF US! | Using this app isn’t easy or streamlined. Customer Service is non existent. I bought 2 chevron gift cards for my trip and paid for my part and have never received them. I’ve spoken to customer service multiple times and they haven’t resolved. Now I’m in a state that doesn’t even have Chevron. I requested a refund and no one will refund me. So I’m paying for something I never received. Deleting this app | Thumbs Up To Sezzle. I have Very Much Enjoyed The Benefits That Sezzle Offers.  I Very Much Want To Rejoin The Offered Benefit However I Have to Wait Til 04/01 to do it. The Membership is A Lil On The Expenses Side tho. | Sezzle has become a scam! It put a “premium subscription” charge on my most recent bill for a “premium subscription” I did not request, authorize or want. Sezxle is now making it impossible for me to cancel this monthly charge and claims they will charge my credit card in the future. I had been a satisfied Sezzle customer for over a year with no such charges until now. Avoid Sezzle and companies that use it! | Me encanta puedes comprar en tantas tiendas y te ayuda en los pagos.

App then deletes that information and gives an error alert for not entering them. | I take images of receipts and they randomly disappear. | Every scanned receipt is taking 2-4 minutes to process.   Highly annoying and unacceptable in todays world | I’m just trying to photograph a receipt. The app spent 45 seconds spinning while “authenticating”, then another minute and 30 seconds spinning trying to load the expense list. I needed 15 seconds to photograph the receipt but was stuck waiting for the app for nearly 3 minutes. | Before the app was updated to this “new look” a user was able to store up to 4 locations in the “personal mileage” section. This made it much easier for drivers that frequent the same destinations not to have to type in the exact same addresses daily. 

Why it’s missing I don’t know, but it is an extremely frustrating loss to many of us daily travelers. | I shouldn’t have to type the “comment” or “business purpose”  2 or 3 times while proceeding into an expense report. It will ask for both while attaching a receipt then immediately on the next page I will have to re-type the same message in the same boxes even though I have clicked “save” before proceeding. Thank you | Review after 2 years of use: App locks up when you try to move an expense out of a report and into a new one. app does not allow for one way car rental. App & website consistently crash. If actually worked, it’d be a great app. | Twice now, in two days, my workflow has been interrupted by this app soliciting feedback. The only way to “opt out” of providing feedback is to say that you “love” the app. 

I don’t “love” ANY app. In fact I don’t “love” any inanimate thing, am I to assume SAP’s developers “love” inanimate objects? Does this extend to rubber dolls?

The app stinks, overall, it’s buggy and has a stone-age interface. 

But I’m forced to use it by my company. 

My company pays me to work for them, NOT to be an evaluator of SAP’s concur app. 

But every time the app asks for feedback I’ll be here, giving another 1-star review. 

SAP is a hot mess and so is their concur app. | Good Stuff! Easy to use. | Every time there’s an update they move everything around and I have to find out where everything is again. The last update deleted all my recent cities. 
The app also takes forever to load. 
Just make it simple so I can get my money back from the corporation I have to stroke everyday so I can eat. Make it simple and then STOP trying to make it “better”. | Not user friendly, slow | Someone submitted my March 2024 expense report for an audit. The report was sent back to me in order to itemize all hotel taxes and fees. We have not needed to do that and it is absolutely unnecessary administrative burden because the hotel receipt clearly shows all those items. Why to manually put them into the Concur SW? If really necessary then have a program or AI do it. Anyway, I did it. Another alert related to the dinner check, which did not show the date. That’s the restaurant’s problem, not mine, and I explained that in the comments. Despite of that the report was sent back to me again. This is a good example when “by the book” is absolutely unnecessary intimidating bureaucracy and harassment of busy employees. People are not treated like this nowadays. | Slow, confusing, bad. | Honestly it’s just a plain bad system, that constantly bugs. Just so much wrong with it really just wish my company would use a different company, it’s legit always something every time I log in. | I can’t reserve anything for work and get an internal server error 500 constantly, thanks for nothing, 0 stars, pls hire someone under 50 to fix the app!!!🥰 | I encounter glitches that create inefficiencies. It should not take more than 15 minutes to enter 5 or less expenses. | Takes for ever to update. Especially while on travel.  What’s in this app that makes it 400MB?  Please reduce app size as it seems overkill and unnecessary bloated. | The web version of concur works grade, the app, however, is so slow. I feel like I’m working in the early 2000s. | I like the functionality of the app when it works. However, it hardly ever does work. Most of the time when I try to pull it up all I get is the loading symbol in the screen. I typically give up after five minutes. This is both using cell data and Wi-Fi on the mobile app. it’s been going on for months. | Love the automated process with the receipts which represents a significant time savings.  Challenge now is every single receipt requires multiple touch points where previously it was streamlined.  One example is when hotel receipts are itemized.  It’s never correct and always needs correction. Hoping they fix this quickly. | Unable to reserve hotel room. Doesn’t give specific error to trouble shoot | Can’t figure out how to update attendees in groups can’t find the information and have spent way too much time looking. | The app doesn’t connect to expenses. The help gave me scenarios no real way to get help. If you need complications in your life this app will help. | Takes forever to log in this app is trash | This most recent set of updates have completely destroyed the usability. It no longer even seems to communicate with the server, continually giving the error message ""we could not load the most recent report data. please pull to refresh,"" which, of course, does nothing. It will not allow images of receipts to be uploaded, again, repeatedly generating an error message. I would give this app zero stars if I could. | Takes forever to load receipts and expenses | Used to love this app. Been using it since 2014 and always found it fast and convenient. I don’t know why they changed to this new style. Everything takes longer. Expense reports won’t load. My expense report takes 3X as long now. It is a buggy mess now. | Concur used to be the best software I used.  It has in the last few years been improved to the point it is the worst user experience of any software I touch. This is horrible people. | Concur used to be a good app. It is now painfully slow and almost usable. Forget entering your expenses as you pay them (which was easy 10 years ago) unless you want your party to sit around for 10 minutes after dinner while you wait for Concur to load. The AI is implementation is terrible. The suggestions are always comically wrong. Hint to SAP, the first line of a receipt is never the total (it’s usually at the bottom). Clearly ther engineers didn’t train the AI or test the app. | I like it | Takes to long to open | Since the last update, the app won’t let me log into my concur… but on my computer on a web browser, I can log in just fine. | Concur made a lot of things simpler - especially after working in Asia where paper receipts and excels dominated, but the app, which is very ok with generally useable functionality seems to have gotten worse. It used to be that my favourite feature would be to open the app, snap a receipt in seconds and have the basics recorded. Now it takes ages to load and even longer to take a picture and confirming the amount has become less intuitive. When I’m on a trip and recording dozens of receipts a week, I reckon this delay is costing me the equivalent of a full working day a year (compared to the previous versions). | This app makes life totally easier. With a snap of a picture, all my expenses are saved! Thanks SAP Concur for making my life so much easier!! | Scanning an Uber receipt? It shows up as a meal. The invoice says “Phoenix, Arizona”? Well glad the tool choose Hong Kong Dollar as the right currency… honestly, the tool makes the most stupid mistakes and wrong scans.. it takes me forever to correct… a other example? You correct the hotel itemization… and just to mess with you the tool updates also the date of the entry… 6 months back… just because… 🤦‍♂️ | God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to the change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference…

…and also grant me the patience to change the things again that I already changed once but the server failed to save.

…and also the wisdom to stop asking when the UI and function of Concur will feel like it crossed over Y2K. | The most godawful app in existence. Common bugs are never fixed. | If the new update from a few months ago was to make this app as inconvenient as possible, then it has been a success. | 有时会死掉，其它都还好 | Generally, this app is very good and works well to create and approve expense reports. An obvious feature that is missing is the ability to match/combine duplicate entries. I create expense entries with receipt's immediately, but the corresponding credit card charge is days later. The iOS app rarely matches these and the web app must be used. | PLEASE FIX. Buttons don’t load. App crashes. | A great way to expense stuff on the go, but I swear they’ve never debugged this app once in it’s lifetime. Most of the time it takes multiple tries to get it to load, and sometimes it never works at all. Too frustrating to be worth it, would rather just do it on the computer and save the time | App is bugged. Keyboard will not pop up to allow typing, also cannot start new report, only see submitted reports. | Not working | It seems like every few months the app crashes, won’t allow receipt uploads, doesn’t work well across iPhone photos (doesn’t want to upload from photos to the app), losing reports, uploaded receipts after crashes causing double work. Frustrating, hope our company moves to a different platform. | Used to be easy. New update and this app is as fast as a snail. Brutal | The app is a nice idea, but it takes 10-20seconds for it to process each step (and there are 4 steps to enter each individual receipt). Needs to be quicker!!! It shouldn’t take more than 5 seconds to completely enter an expense and assign it to an expense report.

Glitchy and stalls a lot! 

This is not a good app! | But the app is garbage. Even after recently updating I can’t add images of receipts. It’s buggy and slow. All the time. It’s literally like 5 actions that need to be completed and this trash app can’t even do that. | Is exhausting. Why does it not work?  It did before you updated it. I still spend my life on authenticating and loading. It never loads and I restart a good five times and may work | Doesn’t load sometimes and I have to close it",4.75853,1002433,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/09/a4/18/09a41852-2419-72cb-1f8e-08c55eb72898/f8c3cde1-6f28-4e52-bd5b-00c726f2af2d_iPhone_5_5inch_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2d/4f/2c/2d4f2c69-7a78-4fcc-42bf-32727ebc4f74/e3402233-8db9-4f13-b824-6c9551f78a10_iPhone_5_5inch_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/18/fe/27/18fe27f9-2290-b3e6-7804-03d8ed589ba5/64f3740b-fb60-4a7e-b192-5e635ea0001a_iPhone_5_5inch_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1d/7d/45/1d7d4537-e19a-7c90-c353-0bd9053134b2/9bc83486-ff73-442a-93e4-8fd8695a336f_iPhone_5_5inch_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/01/da/70/01da705b-bfe6-b57a-433f-2de59af8609b/f2d1934d-5841-4d96-899a-09bc3a1b223a_iPhone_5_5inch_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a6/1b/9c/a61b9c00-c164-a429-acea-2c09477faa26/1f2442c0-bfb7-4073-aac4-3475e85cbb93_iPhone_5_5inch_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/70/e2/cb/70e2cbc1-8a68-553e-3cd2-b849a9605d95/34e54d16-651d-441c-83d7-70d3ae39fdf3_iPhone_5_5inch_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/50/ce/fa/50cefadc-dadb-bdf4-d9e8-c5458e5f1647/0560e8f1-f728-4e6d-b323-75d6f5400667_iPhone_5_5inch_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/52/6f/9d/526f9d7f-6e2e-333c-48be-95380bcb0a59/3d929655-6674-4354-a3bc-5350d9d8b68e_iPhone_5_5inch_9.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ea/33/6c/ea336cf5-2613-d2c1-bda7-ceb10522f946/3fb27281-f7a9-4f61-8ad6-6bce9fff8ee0_iPad_1.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/44/22/b8/4422b883-2af5-2ba4-7f48-dc4ba7d44521/d6d27c56-6da9-4d18-9cb4-580f65a61009_iPad_2.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/eb/2c/cd/eb2ccd94-fa71-3dd4-c194-13279c4c054d/60a79b99-c6c1-4550-b060-fb025caa5ad3_iPad_3.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bd/28/66/bd286603-d991-3af1-7ce5-d8f5aba9dd7e/23f804c4-eb4a-46ac-a771-45f002ee708b_iPad_4.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""i

Bending Spoons wants $80 to send your information and behaviors to their (or all) third-party for their financial interests, not yours. Double dipping, price increased 190%. This is a popular app. It’s probably already been compromised. Bending Spoons will not tell you if your information or who has it, they don’t know for sure. That means they don’t have control over this app and your intimate information. Clime and Bending Spoons is an appropriate marketing communications name, not to be confused with NOAA. The original app I had 4 years ago was far better. This app has regressed too far. Apples built in app works fine, it’s secure. | Was using a couple of different apps to monitor some severe weather threats in my area, and this app’s radar was lagging way behind the others. A band of storms that had already gone through wasn’t supposed to hit my house for another 45 minutes according to this app. | The latest update has made the app essentially unusable for me. You cannot see the forecast in a single screen. You can’t even see the high and low temperature on a single screen. The charts have become unreadable. The interface is somehow cutesy, cartoony and larger. I’m here for the data. This is supposed to be NOAA, not WeatherBug. | There are so many pop-up banners on this site that I can’t see the radar map that is the whole reason I downloaded this app. Very disappointed. | Loving the bright colors | review Love it!! | Other radars showing light rain, past and present, as is correct.  This shows none.  .  .  . | No free features, totally subscription based. Delete immediately unless you want to pay.

DEVELOPERS, THERE IS ZERO OPTION TO CLOSE OUT THE FULL PAGE FORCED SUBSCRIPTION BUY. if this is not what you meant, as I have seen, you mentioned elsewhere that this can be used for free, then please FIX your app! | Decided not to get this app ! Wasn’t free !! | Only gets four stars from me because sometimes the alerts are inaccurate and the weather is delayed | I’m bombarded by alerts that I don’t really need or care about. If you not only want to know whether the sky is currently falling but also that there is a 0.0001% chance that the sky might fall today, this app is for you. If you just want to know that you might need an umbrella today, consider a different app. | I love this because we could see where the storm is hitting. Thank you so much. | This app is un-accurate, not real time weather another words you’re gonna get wet if you look at there is rain coming | Excellent work! we use the Weather  App. religiously for farming. 

Thank you. | Awesome app reasonable price | Unless you pay, you won’t see much if anything at all. | Was forced to change/update my NOAA weather app because the one I had been using stopped updating on the radar selection, was stuck on March 3rd-basically useless. I am not going to pay for any weather service, but in the process to get noaa updated it repeatedly takes me to the “you have to pay for radar” page. I’m finally past that but now I’m not able to get any radar to come up…but the “pay for it” option continues to cover the bottom of my screen 😡 The updated version is full of useless/unnecessary charts and graphs, just give the forecast each day: high-low, wind & percentages for precipitation. Should’ve stayed with what I had, expect to delete noaa and try something else. | I don’t live in or near Harrisburg Junction! | The app no longer displays radar on my device. I also hate the forecast  they added to the bottom of the display. Why take something that works and mess with it? | I turned off notifications, but still received them. I was also receiving multiple notifications for the same exact alerts. So annoying. | I hav e had this as go to for many years, now with ‘updates’ all I get is crash after 2-4 seconds.  Deleted it. | At 84 years of age I have lots of experience with weather forecasting. I trust my own judgement and with the help of your radar I don’t even have to go outside to do it. 
As a child, my father and I would go outside and watch the sky and judge if we needed to go to the storm cellar or back in the house. A couple of time it was a quick trip!
Kansas is known for its unpredictable weather. Cliches like: “If you don’t like the weather, just wait a few minutes, it will change.” And my favorite, which is always right, “it is going to be light today and dark tonight.” | …me to this App. Not always as accurate as Dark Skies was, but the best one going.  Sometimes it’s gotten a little wonky—like Silver Spring MD for example.

 But in comparison to other weather apps, this is my current gold standard. Would be nice if they crowd sourced weather…thought like that might have helped with accuracy of predicting weather and timing. | Good | This is an interesting app with great info, but it can't even locate me correctly?  It reports me in Junction Texas when I am in San Angelo.  These are NOT very close locations.  

Keep trying guys ... | I know people need to get paid but seriously! How many adds do I need? | Just subscribed today! End of February! | Warnings and forecasts and my location cover the radar on the map. Not very high resolution. Pretty but not that useful. There are better apps. | The advertisement for this app says free, UNTIL, you download it and you’re informed that it is “ free “ for three days, then you have to choose a subscription service. | Very impactful! | I've tried using this, and it expects payment. It's not that user-friendly, and keeps giving me forecast of other areas that I've already left.

Whatever happened to where apps and automatically sits where you are now?

This is obviously not one of them. | Used to be great! Over the past year or so tho, the new developers decided to revamp the look, now it's totally broken. Have to go thru a ritualistic open and close the app two times just to see the temperature.
And the layout is horrible! | I wrote a ChatGPT called Motorycle Mapper Pro and I use this to back it up, turn by turn directions without tolls and highways! Good Job | I really like this weather app so far very accurate has everything I need. The one thing I have problems with is the widget every morning it is blank takes a while for it to warm up and start working. | Thank you love it. | The two small towns I frequent and want to know the forecast for do not populate. They are large enough to populate on all other weather apps.
This is very disappointing. | I just wanted to thank everyone for the support I get in getting through this winter with the accurate information and the fact that you guys are always spot on. I hope you all have a great 2024👍🌏 | This app wants $600 a year to look at the weather? | Nice app but there doesn’t seem to be any way to unsubscribe so be prepared to pay for it for the rest of your life | Porn ads | The actual radar of this “Weather Radar” app is completely meaningless. They now only provide 120 minutes of historical data and ZERO time of future radar.  I have several weather apps, all free, this one is no longer of any value so I am deleting it. | Outstanding.I can keep up with the weather in all my important places! | This app sends out tons of notifications for storms that aren’t even happening. The weather predictions are not even close to accurate. I got 7 notifications, one per hour, for a so called blizzard that isn’t predicted on any other weather platform. It is not even snowing. Do not recommend. | Radar only goes about 1 hour ahead.  Useless. | Gracias | Worst radar app I have ever used , it will be raining on me and this app shows nothing in my area . Don’t waist your money and time. | The number one in weather forecast.. | First off- this app does not recognize my city. No matter how I try it calls Cedar Rapids “East Rapids”. Not a big deal but indicative and annoying. The hourly forecast is rarely useful. Especially when the weather is dynamic. I guess it does give me weather alerts, but my radio can do that.

Not very challenging. Had side events but used up same energy you need for main game.  Sorry but deleted this game. | Firstly, I love the girl who does your videos.  Frankly, she’s become the best part of the game.  I’ve played this game every day for over a year and currently at Heiki’s Sauna.  It seems that the deal has become to keep adding more producers and requiring higher level items so that you simply can”t have enough room for everything.  Additionally, some of the events (not the monthly ones) are pretty much impossible to complete.  I’ve spent so many coins to have more spaces having almost reached the max and paid real money for every monthly event until the rewards kept shrinking while the price remained the same. 
I really do like the game but have reached the end of my ability to justify playing it and refuse to spend another penny until it is worth it again.  Heiki’s Sauna has become my breaking point.  Give us more spaces or I’ll find a new game.  For those who haven’t yet gotten to this point I hope this serves as fair warning of what is to come.  Read the posts on Fandom; many players are frustrated.  I’m taking a break from the game. Please make changes so we can enjoy it again. | I Highly Recomend Merge Mansion!!!!!! | This is a great game to play ‘in between’ life’s responsibilities. 

However, please, please, please stop repeating challenges. Once I have gone fishing, I don’t want to do that anymore. Once I have done the topiary challenge, I don’t want to do that again. Multiple garage cleanups for the same items are also questionable.  

I’m still trying to complete the Conservatory while having moved on to other areas. | I’ve been working on a task (yes one task) for a month.   Finally the item was offered in the store for 8000 gems which would take two more years to get for free (waiting for piggy banks … 100 gems every 8 days.

Or……… $100 for one merge

Just sayin… metacore is not earning enough… prices going up…. Game rigged for maximum frustration to get more money.

I hope they tell us grandma’s story when they yank the game from the market and shutter their doors.

Good luck to all the workers in your future endeavors! | I like the game, but it is slow to progress because you have to merge too many items to get to the final one that gives you real points. 100 energy isn’t enough to get you very far, so you either have to wait for the game to automatically top up your energy to 100 again, which takes 90 mins, or use gems to buy more energy. You need gems to buy more of everything & they are hard to earn playing the game, just like energy points are hard to earn. So invariably if you want to progress before a side story expires & you haven’t finished it, you have to buy what you need from the store. You can easily spend a lot of money, even just buying grandma’s stash, which is all the gems you accrued playing the game. At just under $20 for the stash of gems that incidentally don’t last very long since items can cost between a few gems to several 100s or 1000s of gems to burst the bubble they’re in, you can imagine how much you end up spending to finish the game!  If money isn’t a concern for you, have fun coz it was fun while it lasted coz I enjoyed the social messages within the game, like making a better effort to recycling & up cycle etc. | Love the game but sometimes you wont be able to play because the game will say there’s no internet connection, even tho all of my other apps/games work perfectly fine.. so beware before you purchase anything. | I’ve been playing this game for well over a year and I do love it. However, there are a few things that I hate. First, I have still not gotten into the mansion. Second, there are WAYYYYY too many bubbles and stars that pop up all the time! Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the extra coins and stars but maybe just give them in groups, instead of all over the board all the time, it’s extremely frustrating. 
For these reasons I have given a 4 star rating. | Absolutely love the story throughout the game , the areas to be repaired are very engaging and how the missions can be easily obtainable through variety of spawning items. Unfortunately though: (1) it is hard to synchronize the same account on different devices, (2) it is FULL of events that are nearly impossible to obtain in the amount of time given (unless you can spend two or three days straight mostly playing the game) and (3) if you are required to make two identical items and you accidentally merge them… you need to start over from scratch. | Need to know what to merge to get stuff. It gives you the same stuff over and over and doesn’t give you anything covered in spiderwebs. Don’t know why it has to be so hard. | Why is it gone now? At first I wasn’t sure about it but then definitely preferred it in some situations. Why get me hooked on something to just suddenly take it away? | I love this game and have been playing since it came out. The challenges to obtain the wood and the saw to get the wood is ridiculous. It takes days to obtain. I spend money all the time to have access ti the extra goals. Make t easier on us! Love playing yhis game. | You have to pay for almost everything and you have to wait several hours to tap the barrels etc to get the stuff you need to play, like bruh waste of time | This game is so fun lots to do only bad thing is uses lots of money just to play more
I wasted 354 dollars but it’s fun | This game is fun for wasting time; it does that well. However, it is now tedious to do anything when playing for free. I understand this is a company that wants to make money, but it should still be easy to play without that. Pokémon Go does this beautifully. You can tell that paying money would help you advance faster and get more done, but you can make good progress on your own. Now that I’m at Level 25, it feels like it takes me weeks to make any progress. 

My energy runs out quickly and it’s not enough to even help me complete tasks; the recharge rate is super long on things (like the cabinets); even when I use game coins to purchase boxes with additional items, it still costs energy (that’s super annoying); gems are hard and slow to obtain, and events are hard to enjoy. 

I feel that this game should make gameplay fun and attainable for both free and paying customers. I get that those who pay money get additional perks, and that’s fine with me. I don’t mind if I have to work for stuff, but it shouldn’t feel like a long drill. The game is for wasting time! It’s not supposed to be difficult. 

And what’s even sadder is that the developers probably don’t care. I scrolled through dozens of comments, many of which made the same complaints I’m making, and no one got a response. | …it’s SO frustrating.  You can tap a source 20 times, or so, then it’s a long wait for the producer to become active again.  When it FINALLY does become active, you can tap it like 4 times and it’s back in time out.  They often only give you ONE task at a time, and you spend more time waiting on producers than playing the game.  That’s pretty frustrating, and I get enough frustration in real life.  I guess they think we will pay $5 every 30 minutes to make the game playable, but that’s not gonna work for most of us.  I don’t mind spending a little money on a game, but seems they get greedy and think if you are willing to spend a little, then they will just keep throwing detours at you to make you spend more and more.  This COULD Ba fun game if they didn’t make it so difficult to finish tasks.  Giving more than one task at a time would also give options for other things to do when a producer goes dormant.  Another problem with this game is the inventory storage area.  Each spot purchased gets increasingly more expensive.  My next inventory spot is waiting for me to accumulate 18,000 coins to buy it.  Wow.  It’s crazy expensive and also takes away from the enjoyment of the game.  Identical items SHOULD be stackable, but they are not.  The game designers are causing players to lose enthusiasm over the game thru frustration. | Enough is enough! Tired of towels, buckets, wrenches etc and then running out of energy! Hmmpff! 😠 Can't seen to get ahead. | I want to like this game, but the refresh times are unreasonable, especially for how little play you get from a refresh. Too hard to get any items to do anything. | I enjoy this game but it takes too long move up. I’m getting tired of it | Let me just start of with saying I LOVE merge mansion, I am addicted! But I thought of some cool updates that could be added.
1. There should be a night mode for the mansion
We’ve never seen the mansion at night and yet we build so many lamps for each area.

2. There should be a skip task thing
Maybe it’s like a ticket or a special coin that you use to skip a task that you dont want to do

3. There should be a trade with friends thing
For example you search your friends in game id, friend them, and then trade! Maybe they have a really high level cleaning spawner and you have a high level tool spawner and you both need what each other’s got. This would also help add more people to the game since people would want to trade with their friends

It would be really cool to see these things be added if possible! Thank you! | Saw the ads thought it would be fun. WRONG.You  Run Out Of Energy TOO FAST and it takes TOO LONG to get Energy Back. I downloaded a different merge game it’s called “Love Paradise” it’s not a drama Mystery like this one BUT ON THAT GAME I CAN:
1. Replenish my energy by using my coins and gems OR by just watching an AD
2. It doesn’t take 30-40mins for my chests, boxes, reward chests etc to Refresh.
3. There’s no side missions that take away my energy.
Moral of the story. DELETING THIS GAME and going back to that one bc it’s not worth my time | I like this game and it’s fun to play, but I feel like every couple of months the developers get greedier and greedier. The rewards have become smaller (rarely get full 100 energy or more than a couple of purple stones anymore), and it takes forever to reach some of the goals because the producers do not produce what you need - even at the top level!

I have bought packages a couple of times but I’m getting very frustrated when I spend money and can still only play for about 3 minutes before all my energy is spent! I don’t even bother with most of the side games because they use all my regular energy and those rewards aren’t even worth it anymore (15 min hourglass doesn’t help when producers are taking 3+ hours to refresh). Just about ready to uninstall… | It's just another game of bait and switch with the advertising lures you in and then it's just another batch came where you have to spend money in order to get rewards | I love this game so much, my only note would be that I recently tried another merge game, and they had a feature where when an item reached its top level, it had a little crown in the corner, so I think something (like where the blue or green checkmarks are) to tell you an item is at its max level would be amazing! Otherwise I love the game!! | Alright, I have to walk away from this game.  Multiple times I’ve bought packages to be charged differently from what was stated and charged multiple times even days later.  I missed it at first but once I realized it, it’s amazing how frequently it happens.  Walk away, complete rip off. | If you don’t log in for a couple of weeks they go in without your knowledge or consent and delete items from your board. | I like how you use the items you merge. | I have been playing for well over a year now, I used to pay for extras here and there but have quit doing so. The developers have made this game impossible to complete events without paying and if they aren’t willing to give a little then neither am I. Purple energy regeneration is super slow and makes playing not even fun anymore. Start listening to your players and make some improvements and I might update to a 5 star review. | I just started to play and so far I like the game | So sick of having to go wait for it to load to 100 just to kick me out and have to repeat 37 times before I can even play. Kicks me out in the middle of merging. Too expensive!!!!!! | There should be no energy because it is really annoying to wait for more energy. | Side games(fishing and topiary) aren’t that interesting. | This is a great game but suddenly it won’t move to another area. If I’m on the main board , it won’t let me go to the task bar. Or if I’m on the task bar it won’t let me go back to the main area.  I have to close the game wait a while and reopen.  But wherever it opens that’s where I’m stuck. | I like this game, but it needs some improvements.

1). The inventory slots should hold multiple same items so that we have more storage space.   I find the inventory slots ridiculously hard to get and are expensive.

2).  The events don’t last long enough and one can not reach the end.  For example the pony event had 40 ish levels of rewards and I might have reached half.

3).  The timing out for items is to long to tap again.   It takes forever to reset them if you are working on a specific area and need lots of items from specific source like the toolbox or a specific plant.

I love the game but I do not want to spend a fortune on this.

Thank you for consideration.

JC | Been playing this game but I noticed recently that when you wait and merge your piggy banks for more gems and coins that if you add them all to your bank, the game won’t add all of them so I was super gypped on like 100 gems. | I’ve played this game daily for over a year, and STILL haven’t gotten into the house or beyond the plot point that Grandma got arrested (it’s in the game trailer, so it’s no surprise). I’ve completed SO MANY areas outside the house, but still can’t get inside or progress the story. I’m trying to get through the rock garden now. How much longer until I can get into the meat of the game? It feels like I’ve just been playing filler content for months | Ok game not enough energy and not everyone can pay for coins or gems overall 9.9/10!!!! | I really enjoy the game but there have been glitches… specifically items disappearing from your saved items!!! Two glove boxes and a high level vase - all no where to be found. Only other criticism is a lack of variety in the sub games… I mean how many times can I fish or create topiaries. Otherwise… really enjoying the game. | I really do like the game and play it daily. However as you advance into the house you really get delayed. They make it really hard to move forward with delayed items producing. You either have to spend money to open them sooner, be patient or use the resources you have saved. Then it’s one item at a time. You can’t work on other parts while waiting for the items to recharge. It’s so slow. | This game is fun to play but for the love of god please stop making us chase the same icon over and over and over and over. They use the same one all the time.  Say you need a wheelbarrrow then when you get to the wheelbarrow, it makes you use the same icon to get either another wheelbarrow or the next thing up!!! You get sick of playing. Mix it up more please. Then maybe I would play more. | I think you should do this because it is a really fun attractive game where you make matches and it’s just really fun | With the latest update I feel it’s harder to accomplish anything! | GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT | Why so many updates and events? | I’ve been playing this game since 2021 and have LOVED it! There aren’t any ads and aren’t that many pop ups like most games have — only thing I dislike is them changing the coins from their beautiful rusty bronze color to the gold color :( but 10/10 game | As I am only 11, you may not take this feedback as seriously as you would take an adult’s feedback, but I’m here to tell you this is a great game. The part I like most about it is that the game gives you a certain amount of ‘energy’ based on what you earn, and once you run out of energy, it gives you time to stop playing, and come back later. For me, I like how it’s kinda chill, and if I’m doing something low-key, I like to play this game. It also has some mysterious feel to it sometimes, which is also makes it really chill and fun at the same time. The game also barely has many ads! I was very surprised at first, because most games nowadays have ads almost EVERY second when your playing! Sure it has some ads like once or twice, but it’s only if you want to buy something using ads. I don’t want to give too much away, but let me tell you, the grandma has a secret! Play to find out! Overall, this is a great game, with great graphics, and especially NO ADS!! | Very hard to play and demanding. | I love it no adds so far but I hate running out of energy but does teach me not to be on my phone 24/7 | Seems like this game only wants money!  Only played a few months as I just needed a distraction to not think…but this game is rigged to only play if you pay.  Log in. 100 energy. But as of the new update. All the sources to get the items you need …example lvl 7 linen closet to get cleaning supplies.  Literally you can tap 10 times and wait 2 hours.   Won a few 2-4 hour rush times…..use those and might get 4-5 taps on linen closet that now takes 3 hours and 15 minutes.  So if I had purchased the rush time…instead of winning. Would have been a waste!  Regardless…100 energy didn’t last long. Now you have energy left over and waiting hours to log back on. Click 4-10 times and wait 3 more hours.  Seriously?   This is supposed to be a fun game?   Thinking of deleting in a few days…makes you frustrated instead of occupying your mind! | I’ve been playing for almost a year now, and I love the game. It’s addictive, the storyline is fun (I mean who doesn’t wanna know what Grandma is hiding lol) and there’s always neat story events to keep it interesting. However, I did notice something off. I haven’t played in a little while, which isn’t because of the game, but my life had a few changes that needed adjusting. I came back this morning to a gift of energy and an hourglass to skip time, but a LOT of my stuff was gone! I had quite a few items I wanted to hold on to so I can use them at the appropriate time, items I needed to complete tasks, gone. So I now have to fill up my board with those items all over again. I guess the developers thought I stopped because my board was full lol. But as long as I’ve been playing, that’s the only thing that bothered me. Overall a great game if you’re looking to pass the time.",4.56433,153902,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/30/3e/e3/303ee393-05fc-b8ac-352d-235f9577fade/afe0d414-c740-4013-897e-35d11073cf3c_MM_Screenshot.1242x2208_EN_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/d9/29/57/d929577c-3a75-f60e-394d-62563acc3059/4c780750-4ad9-4689-9adb-997f21b901ea_MM_Screenshot.1242x2208_EN_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e6/35/65/e63565a0-e6e7-a0f1-eca4-c5b50743758f/8ef4f4a0-915f-483a-a8b7-2d30ccce5bfb_MM_Screenshot.1242x2208_EN_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/01/86/30/018630f0-5617-b36c-75a7-b23aa2724c1e/b3f6feed-a719-4c3c-845c-7385a08d1f3a_MM_Screenshot.1242x2208_EN_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bd/f6/ff/bdf6ffb9-443d-5c75-84c8-e45659c5ff06/dbf57e30-6203-4df3-b584-13c88039b2c8_MM_Screenshot.1242x2208_EN_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bd/83/e8/bd83e8c0-d64d-3622-1d92-47fc80e22df2/52ef462d-1d52-4cda-b6c5-c01ecdecd843_MM_Screenshot.2048x2732_EN_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/42/b5/37/42b53701-0fb8-3f4c-985c-3b9ec44653e0/b041d067-c38c-445c-b8ce-26f17c1a6fc7_MM_Screenshot.2048x2732_EN_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2c/9d/a4/2c9da43b-5d12-4dfe-5fbb-c2034f6b40c0/b399ffe9-7396-46bb-9b08-b9ca50a0452e_MM_Screenshot.2048x2732_EN_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/0b/ef/44/0bef443b-97b5-e654-eba4-82ce533b8f19/cf51ac68-12af-4cfe-a9f8-4b8d32e0bad5_MM_Screenshot.2048x2732_EN_6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e5/e2/3b/e5e23b57-319c-c369-b5d8-069d122fc801/590b1fd2-33b6-4d73-bf5b-13514f5d7d31_MM_Screenshot.2048x2732_EN_5.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Could not buy tickets in advance on the app - it just kept spinning. 
Once inside no paper map giving an overview and trying to use the map on the phone is a joke. Limited directional signs in the park and no overall map that I could find
Went to Mel’s Diner for lunch. Food was average at best - waited a while and food was not hot. Milkshake was best thing we got.
Hoping things improve | Was not able to order food due to an unknown error to place my order. Since a lot of restaurants are order only, I would have just starved if not for my friends that were able to order for me on their phones. They either need to fix the wallet/card feature or allow patrons to order in person at the restaurant.. | I keep getting an error message when I try to add my credit card. 
I don’t care about promotions. I am here now. They get in the way of figuring out the map. The map is only so so . | Everyone knows how hard it is nowadays to save anything in a savings account for a vacation… that’s on top of trying to save money for rainy days or your retirement.. let’s not forget to include the money for your child’s future education for those of you who have children..
But think about this and listen to my reason why I gave a poor rating.. it took me over two years to save what I could save to experience Orlando Floridas theme parks… all the amazing things that they advertise worldwide about Orlando, Florida, should become one of the most amazing experience that anyone should experience… normally it is.. unfortunately for me my 29 months of saving what I can to take my young one to whatever park she picked..
After spending all of the vacation money for this vacation was not too bad, except for one..(THE LIE) That a representative of universal studio was pretty slick… I’m not sure if they work on commission, but at the end of this supposedly great vacation a life experience that should never be forgotten.. didn’t and very well with the two of us..
When we were purchasing the ticket at the gate. I explain to this representative what we wanted to do…
For some reason, I trusted her that’s the way it should be in America trusting trusting each other.. I guess North Dakota it is like that.. becoming downtown it really is different😢😢..
We were supposed to experience three theme parks.. not looking at the tickets… we experience to great days.. but the last day was the day that didn’t end up great..
We could not enter the third park because we did not have the correct ticket..
I thought I bought three day pass ticket from park to park with the fourth day “”free”” trusting this person’s word… we were going to experience all three parks for the price that she gave me…
we were both so happy that we had enough money to pay for what we wanted to do.. after all, we didn’t plan this trip over two years ago..
But at the end we were only allowed into two parks..
Like I said, I trusted the ticket booth person and what she explained to me.. pay the price as she quoted me go from park to park and if I wanted to upgrade simply pay for Xpress Pass.. at the end, it didn’t matter… we could not enter the last part because it was not on the ticket…
We woke up early every single day to get the most out of what we paid.. but in the end we ended up, leaving disappointed basically a little hurt inside… if any of you can understand what I am trying to elaborate…
I am not the person who is going to be a “”Karen”” so we both left and waited for our plan to come and pick us up the next day…
Pay close attention to what these people say and charge you.. they well lie to you with no remorse.. 
they will easily take your money, and once it is theirs, they will not return it to you…
I wasn’t looking for a return, I only wanted to experience a vacation of a lifetime with my family..
 if I had lots of money, I wouldn’t even be sharing this sad experience with anyone who reads this…
I talk to one person about this at the park.. didn’t care at all what I was saying or trying to explain what happened… I simply said thank you and have a good day..
My advice… look at everything closely before you sign your credit card merchant receipt…
Even if they tell you that your tickets are good for all the parks.. don’t fall for the trap of that they are giving you something free… if you hear the word free, they will take your hard working money…😢 | Won’t allow me to enter my address | Disney is horrible. Go to Universal and have a much better time. Disney has lost the magic and Universal is poised to take many customers. We love Universal. | When trying checkout for tickets the app you receive ad to apply for universal credit card.  You can not bypass ad to get to cart.  I have tried several times over past couple days and ad will not close.  There is no option to opt out or x out of ad. | Awesome parks and entertainment but the “ Fast Pass “ ticket option is more than ridiculous in price . | Had a great 3 days at Universal and islands of adventure! Very clean and efficiently run. I felt I received a amazing experience. The negative was lack of signage throughout the park…the App was very primitive and useless in the map category
Otherwise 5 stars!!! | WHY DO COMPANIES INSIST ON MESSING UP THEIR OWN APPS?!

The app was great until the update now it’s harder to order food, the menus aren’t housed on the app it redirects to the website (always a terrible decision) and everything is more difficult to navigate and find. So frustrating!!!!!!! | Fun | Los parques siempre limpios y la amabilidad de los empleados. | I love universal so much it’s literally my happy place | En el día de hoy dejé a mis hijas en los parques, viajando desde Miami y lo cierran sin aviso quedando mis hijas sin poder disfrutar de lo que tanto costó, $170 dólares y me cierran el parque a las 6 de la tarde, una vergüenza | I want to thank the lovely lady at Lost & Found Fri afternoon 4/12 who had my iPhone and was kind enough to charge it until I picked it back up! So very thoughtful and a lovely ending to our fantastic two days at your lovely parks!! Until next time Universal Studios! Diane, Mark & Luke Baum, Oswego IL | This new version is great. The animations are super smooth and the new tab bar makes it so much easier to get around the app. Well done Universal Orlando devs!! | Waste of time and money | Trying to order food for pick up in a hurry and figuring out that I have to enter five minutes worth of personal and credit card information just to use this app when I’m on an iPhone. Welcome to the 1980s. | Waiting for food order to be ready…turns out the food folks wait for you to come to counter before they prepare your order. | The app is very helpful, the dining time for Mels at Universal Studios was incorrect. It shows the time for pickup, but the food was not yet ready. | The fact that I have to use an app to order my food is an inconvenience. My family and I, after walking through out the park are hungry and thirsty. We go into the three broomsticks which is the closest location and after seating, we waited for a server. That fact that we waited more than 15 minutes for someone to tell us that we had to DOWNLOAD an app of all things to place our order is NOT appropriate for customers especially if it’s their first time. Either change the way how someone orders their food or have the option of giving someone a menu for them to order from when they arrive at the location. | I have my handicap card and besides parking not receiving any accommodations of assistance. I’ve talked to 5 employees and have been dismissed with shrugs. I accidentally overspent on two extra tickets so I’m indeed very unhappy. $500 for a waterpark an not able to enjoy it is so not cool. | laggy animations scrolling through this map. is this compatabile with the latest IOS | Not user friendly and difficult to use map features. | First trying to scan tickets on to phone was challenging to say the least. Scanning went much too fast to capture barcode. Then you couldn’t use it because it was too easily stolen by others and has to use the paper ticket for express anyway. Then some of the rides didn’t work. 
Nothing to do with app but having to pay for bag storage while on the ride is OUTRAGEOUS. I guess over $3000 for 6 is just not enough. | Only good for the map. Go to Disney for virtual wait lines on the app | I think the app could use some help with navigation to each ride throughout the park. I also think that the app/park should offer a half day pass for entry into the parks after 4pm | Now while it’s efficient; it’s also a way not to deal with people. Keeps the masses at bay. It’s a theme park. I guess progress. Why not just have people come in bubbles; like prisoners few thru a window. Well you get the drift. | it is fon to go too nd te hary potttr rid was veery fon.me aslo lik Sumpsons,transformrz n te kongking. 

(Btw I am not two I just felt like doing this) | 2k24 #1 APP is this 1 | This is a decent app, but the map view of the park should display real-time wait times for rides. Having to click on every ride individually to check the wait times (or view a list that doesn’t give a sense of geographic location) is silly. | The app won’t put my order for my food in y’all need to fix this it’s so annoyjng | When waiting for it to change from being prepared to ready how are we shops to know to wait inside ?
It never changed from being prepared to ready until after I went inside to check an got my food | The wait time does not show in volcano bay!!! 4days before it shows, now it disappears! We bought a 14 days 3 parks ticket and we want it fixed immediately! | This app will not allow me to create an account after several time wasting tries.  Useless! | Decided to bring the family to both Parks. While Disney has some of its most beloved rides such as Haunted Mansion, Peter Pan, Pirates of the Caribbean I must say Universal Studios has blown me away with the entire experience as you walk in you can see many cool building and rides all around. The Harry Potter them Park areas including the rides were well worth the wait. You just get more for your money at Universal Studios…. | They tried. Super long wait, cold food but very friendly workers. | I keep getting “Oops! Can’t save your info” every time I try to order food or do anything on this app. Completely useless. | The app has is glitching and the parks are trash compared to DW | The current functionality is helpful, especially “ride wait-times” and “show time”

However there are other features that can greatly improve our experience:

1) Provide “Directions” to selected locations (Rides, Restaurants, Shows)

2) Provide suggestions to alternative / nearby attractions when wait-times exceed 60min

3) Provide recommendations on how to best optimize your day at the park | I will never visit this place again. Your ride estimates were abysmal and your staff seemed rude at times. I will never revisit this place, it was the worst experience. | Is Apple was so helpful when my and my family stayed there it was so there we did it to check the times and it was just blessed. It bless his heart and if you guys have never gone to universal, I suggest strongly to do it because it was very cool there’s a lot of themes and yeah, but the app is just the best it tells you the times the food restaurants so I strongly strongly recommend going to universal and getting this app and if you have time but I did and I went to eat so do that if you any time it SeaWorld. | .z8 RT | Not helpful while in Universal | App design is terrible. The process for setting up guests and assigning g tickets is super confusing. Accidentally assigned a child ticket to an adult because it was so confusing. No apparent way to reassign them. Everything else is a similar mystery. | I love this app! It is easy to see where you are and what is near you. I came up with an idea that you can see where other people in your party are so you can meet up. Just an idea ☺️ | Had a blast watching 2 of my grandchildren had a blast 1 had been there a before so he was the tour guide. I can’t wait to come back. Thank you | Need to improve the Map experience to provide guidance on how to get to attractions from the current location. 

It is good to have the waiting times on the app. | Ordered a salad at 3:43 to pickup between 4:15-4:30.

Arrived at 4:35. Still not ready.

My biggest complaint is the notifications. I had been getting numerous irrelevant notifications from the app so I had turned off Lock Screen and banner, just leaving badges and Notification Center on. My last U-Haul rental was two months or more ago; and the time before that was almost 2 years ago. I don’t have any reservations pending and haven’t searched for any future dates or even opened the app in a couple of months. Well, today, in Notification Center it said “A Haul location is less than a mile. Tap to start pick-up”.  The location it was referring to was the one I last used 2 years ago. Again, I have no upcoming reservations, searched, active or cancelled, so I find that interruption annoying.  Other than NOT Allow Notifications from U-haul or deleting the app completely I don’t see how it can be stopped whenever I am stopped within a mile of that location. | I made an appointment after confirming it’ll only take an hour and a half if I had an early appointment to install a hitch. Which for the morning of May 7. I then received an email saying or take three hours. When I responded to the email, no response was given to me. When I again responded to the email again no response from U-Haul. Then when I called, they put me on hold and be one minute five minutes later I called back and they were very rude.if you make enough money with other people, you don’t have a good day | I went to the U-Haul moving and storage location on 594 Bearses Way, Hyannis, MA 02601 to get some information about whether or not they would store my travel trailer for a month or two depending on what my needs were at the time. I was well received by Corey Lewis the hitch professional at the counter who is extremely professional and courteous and kind I must say, he gave me the information and also printed it out for me so that it would be easier for me to make plans when I need to call and reserve a spot.
I think that Corey represents U-Haul in a very positive way and should be commended for his pleasant and positive attitude towards customers. Customer service to me is very important and I have always received good service at this location. 

As I was leaving I realize I had another question and there were two gentlemen out there one young man who had only been there two weeks and sorry to say I did not get his name, but I could not have received a more welcoming approach, even though he was in the middle of hitching up. He said he loved working at U-Haul. It was his best decision he had having come from construction work.
Then another gentleman came over and also offered assistance, and it was just regarding the electrical hitch that I have on my SUV that will be towing my travel trailer in the near future. He was also very kind and professional, and went inside to get a little object to, check the connections and make sure that everything was working properly.
This is why I always use U-Haul whether I am here on Cape Cod I and or down in Florida I have used them several times and will always use them in the future.

I also have to complement everyone that works there and keeps the store in such clean and neat order!
I look forward to doing business with U-Haul and the very near future sincerely, Conrad G | Best service and extremely professional.  Lucas was so good to us and we are so thankful! | Trying to create profile but keeps saying error to connect to server. It’s not on my side. So this is not helpful at all. | Normal corporate spending on not reviews, app is designed to check in trucks and cause confusion so you have to pay 20 for not properly returning truck. Have to take pictures and 10 step process just to return truck total scam | We just want to give you money.  Why do you make it so difficult? 
Please don’t make us wait 45 mins to talk to a person for something as easy as changing a password or deleting an email address.  Every single time I get the “Unable to send code” I wonder who gets a kickback when I have to call customer service. | The app would be convenient if it worked. The app refused to load during pickup and drop off so I still had to go inside to talk to a representative | Can’t get logged in due to repeated time outs. Terrible app. | Reviews really do matter and that’s my fault for not checking before using this one or really this company at all. Made a reservation the day BEFORE for a trailer and an appliance dolly. Not only did they not have a clue about my reservation when I walked in THEY DIDNT HAVE ALL OF IT. THE 2nd moron working the desk response was “well it’s been a busy day” really???? That’s what the reservation is for!  After the 1st moron thot it was funny she had to call what I can only guess was a manager to see if they could cancel my reservation, like I was still going to pay for a reservation they didn’t fulfill? This is my argument for paying people $15-$20 an hour. Total incompetence and lack of caring. Never mind that I had made accommodations for the afternoon to move stuff AND have other people help me move stuff. They just wasted multiple people’s time and money and probably being paid $15 an hour to sit there and be stupid. AI could replace these idiots no problem. Do your self a favor and read the reviews and don’t do business with this company and store. I’m realizing now you can rent trailers and dollys from a lot of other reputable places. | App and website both useless, app has two spots to check in online, neither of them load whatsoever, and it sends to a screen saying to call a number. When we call, we get told there’s no need to call and to use the app or check in in person. When we went in person, they told us to just check in in the app.

Website is no better and no page for online check in ever loads, on any phone or PC. | Downloaded the app for the “scan me” feature for tracking the boxes as I pack.  Nothing works and the app keeps crashing. The only feature that seems okay is the one asking me to purchase more supplies. I can’t imagine actually thinking I could rent a truck using this thing as I can’t get past the first page… | Words can’t express how disappointed I am with the app! | Useless app. Have an account I can use online but won’t even let me sign into the app. Tried resetting password and everything. Wish could give 0 stars. | I rented a 15 ft truck for today. Chris had it ready for me at 7 am. There was a minor issue and Chris quickly put me in another truck. I had no issues with the vehicle after that. Setting up the reservation and returning the truck all went smoothly. The truck was clean and had a full tank of gas when I picked it up. I made sure I returned it the same way. I will certainly use them again in the future. | The workers are very friendly and helpful, The app was useless in my experience. | Took a 15’ truck from Plano to Columbus, GA and more recently a 10’ truck to Birmingham,AL.  The service from origin was absolutely superb in EVERY respect.  Love working with those folks.  They understand customer service! | She was great system was down when I called she got back to me the minute it came back up and she was very helpful and knowledgeable. I’ll be back!! | They urge you to download the app because it’s “faster” and “more helpful” yet the app is SO slow and doesn’t load anything or often says “network connection lost”. | Bought U-Haul smart label and got email 
Printed on special paper to make into stickers 
Used the app to scan and it crashes every time
Wasted the money for the labels and printing paper 
Fix the app please | Renting from uhaul bunkbeds went well i have rented from them in past and had disagreements but this time everything went smoothly they have two new employees and when returning truck in Washington the girl was on it didn’t have to wait | If I could leave a negative review I would. I rented a truck for my step daughter to move. When time to return they wanted to be lazy and not finish the move, I called uhaul and said I would not pay for more than 1 day. I was assured my card would not be processed for anything more than the one day and that it would be on the card I had given them. It was completely out of my name. 3 days later my card is processed for 3 days and had a bunch more that I hadn’t originally ordered on it. Now I can’t get any help with this. It’s been weeks and the other card wasn’t even ran. This caused my bank account to be insufficient and cost me quite a bit of money. Horrible customer service when I cannot even get a call back | I can’t get the app to work. All search feature is good, but all the links are dead ends. Also many places could use more photos that one… other than that that’s all I know about them. 
Willing to edit once fixed | Extremely disappointed in UHaul.  My Dad had a 26 ft. Truck and Trailer and arrived from Oregon.  Had Moving.com set up to unload on 3/13. The Storage Unit was reserved ahead of time because the lady said they go fast this time of year. Arrived with the movers and was told there was no unit. We had a 10x 40 and they offered us a 10 x5.  Said a lady never moved out of the unit so we could not have it.  Did not get a free month storage as was promised .  Had to find a new place for storage and had to cancel and then find new movers and pay extra money due to short notice. So disappointed!!!    Larry Olson and Jacque | There were constant timeouts and dropped order items. I was using the app only for packing supplies. After fighting the app for 2 hours, I chose to pickup at store. (The app fails to mention that delivery to home next day would cost $36 on an $88 order- until entering all credit card details). I received notification from my credit card that I was charged for the proper amount. 
I didn’t receive notice that my order was ready. I tried to reach the store for 30 minutes. They were “helping other customers “ and to download the app. Yikes! Just a merry-go-round. | This app is terrible! They send you a verification code, and the minute you enter it it automatically gives you an error code that your time has lapsed. What a crock.
Guess that’s why I need to go to a different service provider | U-Haul is trying to get rid of as much human interaction as possible. The app does not work well. I kept getting confirmation codes that wouldn’t work. Checkout is a royal pain. If there weren’t a monopoly. I’d go elsewhere just to avoid the app. | I have had better luck talking to a person than dealing with the app. App did not recognize my reservation so had to use the website. Mobile pickup takes a long time to get through, returning took a long time as well.  With a person, I’m in and out within minutes.

Next time I’m using someone else. | I’ve been trying to check-out through the app and no matter what I do it shows every location in the state except the one I’m at, so I can’t even check out. Very inconvenient and frustrating. Clearly this is the app’s issue. | I just want to be able to pay my storage unit bill nothing hard but the app doesn’t work every time I try to set it up it needs a code to confirm my number or email the numbers that come in don’t work 
I go online on my computer to set up and I can’t because somebody use to have my number and this is just getting old.
The confirmation code come in a few seconds after I ask for it I put it in right away and get a Messages saying they have expired | Trying to set up this app is a huge pain in the……. You get the picture. You’ll need to get a verification code and when you enter the code it will tell you the code is invalid. Even went to their online chat to get help. Finally got “verified” and started to complete my profile. Was told I couldn’t complete the profile without a phone number or email address but when I tried to enter them it said they were already in use. Wanted to pay some tolls from a recent rental but the link in the email they sent only opened the app which doesn’t work. Had to drive down to a UHaul office to take care of it. COMPLETELY USELESS AND COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME. | This app is trash. Sms codes repeatedly failed. Reservation # didn’t appear. Layout is horrible. | Worst app. Does not work. Do better u-haul. | Created account on the website and tried to log in on the app, only to be met with a two-factor authentication requirement. Code sent to phone is either not recognized as valid code, or gets an error saying the code has expired despite entering it within seconds of receiving it. Same issue with code sent to email. When I try to reset the password, it tells me no account exists under either my email or phone number, despite having logged in and received verification codes to both on the desktop site. 

Sure does make it hard to pick up a truck. | Wasted nearly two hours of my Saturday trying to use it to pick up and drop off my rental (had full cell service, so that wasn’t the issue). Would get almost to the end before the app crashed and restarted. Website also wasn’t working well that day. Long hold times for customer service to get assistance (though they were helpful with troubleshooting once we connected). Maybe it was just unlucky timing, but strongly consider renting from a location when it is open and a human is there. | I was very impressed by the customer service on both ends. The girl that helped at Uhaul was terrific. Despite being on her own and swamped. 

Ishi and the other driver were great. Great customer service with a smile. Very friendly and quick. I’ve had a lot of movers. They were right up there with the best. 

Stephanie Burns | U-Haul the company so far is great- great pricing and flexibility, etc.

The app is slow and glitchy. I’ve tried several times to sign my rental agreement and it never loads. Other things will load but then close out before I can finish. I’ve had to go onto the computer to be able to take care of things. So far the app hasn’t been a help at all, but it’s been a pain. | Made reservation on app. Good. 
We were switched to a bigger vehicle. 

Went to pick up and no vehicle assigned. Called and got vehicle assigned. 
Took 15 minutes to get to photo verification. 2 bars and wouldn’t upload. 
Another call. Switched reservation to an open location. 
Was a line, so I started to check in on app. Was able to upload photos there. 
They didn’t have that vehicle. Went back to first location, (same local business). That truck wasn’t there. Another call. National agent transferred me to local. Monica could get me in one of the trucks that were there. But it had been 3 hours. I’d have been done with rental in that time. I had other things to do. She was able to cancel it, and refund.  
I’ve been using U-Haul for 25 years. I’ll continue but will not be using app until these issue fixed:
1. Changing vehicle 
2. Upload high res photo. 
3. Assigning a vehicle not at a location, 
4. Correct phone number in app for pickup. (Called number to be waiting to be told wrong number, transfer to more hold) | The application freezes constantly, and the UHaul service team is the worst in business. | This app is a complete mess, full of logistical issues and bugs. U-Haul does absolutely nothing to help when you call or get on support. This is the least streamlined app experience I’ve had in a while. | It’s a lot of work to organize, photograph, and tag everything

If the app gets corrupted or deleted, or I lose my phone, I am screwed! I also can’t share the information with my partner. | I cannot recommend using this app for before hours pick up.  We had problems with every aspect of the pick up.  It took 3 calls to customer service and caused us an hour delay. | Please enable the ability to print receipts, especially for storage rental units. | I tried multiple times to get the app to work for my reservations but every time I try to check in or return the vehicle, it doesn’t allow me to. It just gets stuck on help videos. Ended up just having to use the website on my phones browser. | You can’t do after hours returns with the app. Don’t waste your time downloading this app. | App is pretty much useless. I had to take the same pictures 5 times before I just gave up. Luckily the rep in the location helped me even though it was after hours. | So i planned to get the truck early and I was told I had to download this app to get the truck. I was never told I was going to be charged $13 just to download the app! Then the app didn’t even work. After 1 hour and talking to 4 customer service reps (who were super nice) I wound up having to go to a U-Haul that had actual people working because the app was trash. | This app gave me so much trouble to sync my reservation from website.

Advertises a low price for rental then bangs you over the head with supplemental coverage at checkout that you can’t opt out of. Got the same rental for half the price through Enterprise app. | Tried calling Hertz to get a toll charge from a past rental reversed and put on a new card, as the old card was no longer valid, but was pushed off to another long queue and nobody helped me in the end. | The app has become unusable for me in recent update. When I go to remove or add a discount code the app gets stuck and unable to navigate out of the screen. There is no way for me to book car this via the app now. | Your app changed my pick-up and drop-off times (but got the dates right), which I did not recognize until reviewing all details at the end…so I had to go back to the beginning and make the changes for the right times; the real irritation was that because I went back to the beginning I had to re-enter all other details including credit card # and billing address, even though when I entered that info the first time it was supposed to be saved. | Hertz needs to make promotions and CDP options clearer. I came across about 5 deals but not sure which ones took and would have given me the most discounts. And it seems it’s different in the app than online. | Thumbs up for continuing to provide excellent service | Slow app and very buggy | I rented a car for my daughter through the app.  I listed her age as 20, and prepaid including a surcharge for her young age. She arrived at the airport, and they wouldn’t rent to her. They said their local policy is 21. The app should not allow a rental that can’t be honored. | My experience over the years with Hertz has been excellent. | Great Service and hustle from the agents in Nashville. | Tried to use Gold portal on pc. I had a previous reservation and portal would not allow me to make a new reservation. Kept defaulting to existing reservation.  Had to use the app.  No explanation as to why I cant pay in advance to skip the lines. | I have used this app for quite a while, however when they added Apple Pay it gets quite frustrating, it defaults to Apple Pay and I do not want to use it.   I wish I could set a default payment method for my corporate card. | I have always been a Hertz loyalist but this is getting out of hand.  The last three trips I’ve tried to book when I get a price EVERY vehicle class is priced at 3,999 per week.  I always book 6-9 months before travel and if I can’t do that with Hertz anymore I’ll have to take my business elsewhere. | My userid/password fail on the app but work fine on the website. It’s been going on for several weeks now. Not sure why Hertz bothers to have an app. Maybe they don’t. | I’m trying to install and use Hertz Car rental app on iPhone 13 but the app doesn’t load, it shows error message “we are experiencing issues with the app, please try again”. I tried reinstalling the app multiple times and multiple days but the issue is not resolved. Can the app developer rectify the issue and fix it. Send me confirmation once issue is resolved so that I can install the app and start using it. | I would like to start off my saying David the Utility guy does an outstanding job taking all of the vehicles!

Jesus my goes above and beyond ti make sure all the customers are taken-care off!! | Hertz doesn’t seem to understand how to build quality web or mobile experiences, or people’s expectations of these technologies.

Book travel and a Hertz rental car through Expedia, for example, and the Hertz website and mobile app don’t know about your rental. Give them the Hertz confirmation number and they can find it but they don’t persist this booking to your Hertz account, so next time you log into the website or mobile app you have to search again from scratch.

Modifying account settings such as credit card, contact info fails as often as it succeeds. CC expiration date checking is bugged and thinks, for example, that  Nov 2024 is in the past (it’s currently April 2024).

Current license and selfie upload process is fragile on both mobile and web. 100% failure for me, using both.

Needs an investment in people, process, and testing. | Did not mean to do 5 Stars | I always have a pleasant experience at Hertz Coral Springs location! Service with a smile and Ann is amazing! | I have been trying to update a reservation and the app would not let me.  I waited on line for 12 min and a gentleman answered.  I told him I needed to change the time same date and location on.  He put me on hold for a few
 Min and then hung up. | Downloaded just to manage an existing rental, since the website couldn’t find it even with all the info. Buggy and generally wouldn’t load at first, then when it finally did I tried to see options for cancelling or modifying. The app instantly cancelled my well-in-advance booking in for a peak time and place (2024 eclipse), with no confirmation or warning screen, and no way to undo. Customer support bluntly refused to even try restoring it, I was forced to get a new reservation (elsewhere) at surge prices 2x higher. | I mean. Authenticate the device once. Maybe every month. Bot not every single time I open the app. This is insane. Awful. | When you started asking for pictures which you can keep and demanding a signed agreement to binding arbitration you began the process of losing my business. As a long time Hertz gold member I resent the threat of a line at the counter for not checking in ahead of time. If this means that I can no longer proceed directly to the cars available my business will no longer be with Hertz. | This app never works! You would think a company as big as Hertz could have a decent app! | 4/9/24 - App won’t let me make reservation. After choosing vehicle, app chirns on “choose coverage” screen. Never completes. Wow!  12/5/23 Long time Hertz renter. I absolutely hate the current version of the Hertz app. I hate huge tiles, less info on screens, almost no options for sorting. Forced through endless menus I don’t want just to see car price. I want a daily price all in, but that doesnt exist either.  Old review: I can’t back out of various menus that seem to be freeze. The only way out is to close the app and start over. since Face ID seems to recognize me and then not work. I’m forced to re-enter the password by hand every time now. when I’m traveling, this is really getting old. The look of the app is fine. Functionality is limited | I | Waiting an hour for President circle, no cars on lot and with a line of people at LGA, oh how Hertz has fallen | Pathetic waste of time.  I though I had forgotten my password because this trash app would not let me log in.  So I reset my password.  Same exact deal!.  Did it twice to be sure.  Tried my email as user name AND my membership number.

Fix your junk!!! Enough to make me go with Avis or Sixt. | One star simply due to the fact that there is no way to contact an agent if necessary. I get it that corporations don’t want to talk to their customers anymore but at least give the option to wait on hold forever like most other companies.  Hertz doesn’t even provide an option to call them. Crazy | I am on the board for 5 star with zero cars in that zone. No I am waiting in a monster line wasting my time. | I booked a car on the app for a last minute trip. I prepaid using Amex for a Tesla.  The charge went through. When I arrived at my destination at Midnight they asked for my card. They said it was declined and I needed another.  I called Amex because I did not know why it was declined. They said they had not declined any transactions and that there must be a terminal issue.  They tried a different terminal and that did not work.  Hertz would not key the card in.  It was my only credit card. I would need to use my debit card,  but they would not rent a Tesla with a debit card and the car that I could rent cost more. Additionally, since I was using a debit card I was going to have to pay an additional $500 deposit. 
It was late and the rental car kiosks were closed. I was exhausted, in a strange place and felt Hertz took advantage of a weary travelers vulnerability.  I will not be using them again. | Hertz presidents circle | The Western Branch Manager is AMAZING . Austin is very pleasant helpful and dedicated to his work and the customers | I’m on electronics all day. This was a very unfriendly interface to make a reservation. It should have taken less than 5 minutes. | Rented a car recently and made the reservation online only to see the rate change after I rented from the airport facility in St Marteen.  Sad. | This is hands-down one of the worst apps I have ever used. Whoever the developers are should be fired. It is constantly buggy: it adds fees by default, and you can’t uncheck them which is a SCAM. Absolutely horrific experience. | I cant open application. Its showing opps something went wrong. Let me know solution | This company, not the agents at the counter, but the company does not treat customers as valuable. Inflexible policies, refusal to honor agreements such as bait and switch on the rental car available at arrival, refusal to grant discounts available online when renewing or meet me half way when there problems or challenges. 
If not for having a Tesla or other ev’s I would not ever work with this company, but that’s the sucky part of living in the suburbs. I have no alternatives. Good for hertz! Bad for me. | So first time I have had a rental on the hertz gold app. Looking forward to skipping line. Showed up with rental showing in the app only to be told that only works if you rent through their app. 🤷‍♂️However once I was at the counter I was told by another employee it was because it was my first rental.  From this point forward I should be able to skip the line. Hope so because rates through the app are twice the price of anywhere else with them. | Would not start the app until I turned off NordVPN. | Locked out of account, can’t pair reservation, just keep getting errors trying to reset password. Awful online experience. | I love the simplicity of Hertz Rental Car. Hertz’s makes renting a vehicle a breeze… | Didn’t know I had to download load the mobile application to make it work. | Difficult to navigate while my rental is active. Why does the app not know that I have an active rental. Why do I have to put in a confirmation number to find a my rental details?
 Where is my rental history? | Hertz sent me an email saying I can make my check in process smoothly by using the Mobil app. However, there has been nothing but headaches, I can’t even begin to list them. | Doesn’t work. Just like hertz | Great service and very convenient with a nice line up of cars to choose from. Always purchase the gas option that allows you to return car without gas. I had to fill up last minute before returning car and I was in the hood, hood. Like hooood as in gangsta hood. | This is is almost flawless and remains to be very intuitive for many user types and the only glitch I encounter is with certain credit cards like my MasterCard which it’ll never accept but 4 other major rental agency’s have no issue. It’s an app issue only. | They should give us more options to choose the exact car we are rented. It was much better to select the car we want, not to bring us any car they say for that we pay for a good, comfortable service | App missing feature available with online reservations like prepay.

When I go to the profile tab to make sure I’m signed in on the right account, it just stays on the loading screen. I loved the trip planner on this, but now I’m going to have to go with a different app | Great app. Only complaint and it’s a big one for me. Is the refresh. Auto refresh when you minimize and come back. It’s the worst feature on iPad or iPhone in general. Makes it completely impossible to do any kind of productive work and multitasking!! | This app has been recommended by some YouTube channels so i tried it. The recent  bad reviews are pretty much dead on so I’ll find a better app. | UPDATE THE APP ALREADY! Slowest app I have ever used. Lags. Takes forever! If that would happen it would be 5 stars. | So far in less than a month since subscribing i have been charged three times and seems no one will help just told me if i want to cancel i can. After ive paid a hundred dollars for less than a month! Do not subscribe! | It has potential, I ended up google maps and paper to get everything organized. The trip planning app is really bad. | Just download the app for specific purpose of finding campsites along the road-trip route. I set a single filter for my first search: campsites. What does the app do? Displays RV parks that don’t allow camping. Useless!!!! The technology is only as useful as the data. Which seem to be very poor. Very disappointed. | Rather ironic actually. App for finding FRER camp sites and then aggressively pushes a exorbitant subscription fee ($40ish), $40, really!? And sadly the app doesn’t really help finding anything outside sites that many other FREE sites and apps provide. | This app is outdated, and what I mean is, it relies on users to report or post information on campsites. So if people are not actively posting then it’s useless. There are places on here that don’t exist or places that are not reported. It is unlikely that you will find anything if use unless you live in an area that is known for outdoors. | I’ve purchased the pro upgrade and it constantly asks me to upgrade to pro. The button to restore subscription is unresponsive.  Struggling to see why this is better than the free recreation.gov app | I don’t get the hype. Maybe it’s ok for families that stick around the most obvious campsites. According to this app there is no camping in Yucatán or Quintana Roo but I live here and we have thousands of camp and tent sites. For $35 it should work beyond yogi bear campground. 

For me and anyone else that explores beyond the obvious places like Yosemite, this app is totally useless. | I am going camping in the summer this really helps me a lot | Was a great app for RV’ing…now they won’t even show park locations unless you pay for their pro membership. Would give zero stars if I could as that’s about how much it’s worth. What a shame. | Great information i have been able to find amazing places with this app. It is slow for old devices and does not perform under low data mode so watch out. Get your coordinates before you leave out. Also super slow startup splash screen that freezes often. 

 Best app on the market so far i think for camping so please leave more reviews on campsites | We LOVE camping at the annex. It is not free and you must have a Military ID card for entry. We are on the way home from a night camp out at the Annex. It’s only $20 a night for a full hook up RV site, they also have very cute cabins that your other military ID card holders can rent if they don’t have an RV. it’s very large, very quiet. The bathrooms are extremely clean. They have coin operated washers and dryers at the main bathrooms at the campground. It’s on the shores of lake Texoma, it’s beautiful you can see Oklahoma from there! You could also rent boats at the marina and if you’re hungry the grill is open in the summer! 

Tent and RV camping 
Trails
Clean bathrooms and showers 
Boat rental
Large open field to watch deer 
Military ID card holder's only | It wants to search near yiur PRESENT llcatiln, useless when planning a trip. So i search by state-Texas. Dozens of sites identified only by name, best guess as to where they are is the photo. This app is useless for planning a trip unless you know the exact town you want to camp at. | Great app | I have paid for pro level and have never been able to access it.  This app is terrible and customer service has not been any help.  They send me scripted steps to take to gain access and they don’t work.  They never follow up to see if their instructions were helpful. So far terrible overall but maybe this rating might cause them to contact me. | Dyrt It might be good for finding a camp ground near you but I cant recommend it for planing a trip. After much frustration trying to use the program to plan a trip I contacted support.  According to support: What it does is allows you to plot out the trip in advance, not navigate to the locations. “It's a plotting and planning tool. Hence the name ""Trip Planner"". “ Waypoints can be ""stops"". Some folks want to stop at a location, but not stay there, so it's a waypoint for the program. A way to go (and some users use it for directional details to - to take them on the roads they want to go, but not stop there). “We are not a navigation tool so that's why we offer (on web and app) the option to Export to Google for that purpose”

Navigation with google in an RV is not the best choice for me. YMMV | This has got to be the best app ever made for Camping advice! | Text doesn’t zoom on iPad making it difficult to read. Roads and highways are also difficult to see on map. | I use this signed up, paid for the app and realized that this was a waste of money. I tried to book a campsite on the app and it crashed. Then I looked on Google maps and was able to see 3 to 4 times the amount of campsites that this app provided that I paid for so I was able to find a better campsite and able to book it on Google Maps with ease it didn’t crash. | Awesome site. Makes it easy to find a camping site | 👍🏻great app | I just got the PRO in search for RV parks to stay with 22’ travel trailer during our trip to San Juan islands, and 2-months ski trip to Canada, UT, and CO. This app shows many campsites but over 90% are closed for the winter… I have wasted too many hours and just found one campsite ($127/night). It also loads very slow. It has not been useful at all. I got this useless app on 50% off so apparently nonrefundable. Hate wasting money on an useless app. DO NOY WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS APP, SO NOT WORTH IT! | I loved this app when it was free. Greed ruins everything. I’ll delete. It’s sorry you had to mess up a good thing.

No it’s not what you say. A lot has been taken away. That and your response is as if you didn’t read or understand my review. Either way you’re wrong about the claim it’s the same. Your lack of understanding my comment is actually more troubling though. | Many listing and an easy site to navigate | If you try and cancel your free trial, you will still be charged. And DYRT customer service won't refund you, because it's in their terms and conditions. Deceptive. | I have used this app for years and it’s got great I formation and pictures to make a good division for camp sites | Pretty good and easy to use | not really free camping if you have to pay a fee just to even view ""free"" campsites. | If you want app that has the worst customer experience, this is for you!! 
I’ve tried countless times to get help just using the basic functions of this app and nothing loads still. 
So if you like paying nearly $40 for a yearly subscription for a nonfunctional app then this is for you!!
You’ve been warned-these people are money grabbing scammers, beware. | Excellent app for camping!!! | I live in Tennessee and got this app hoping to find new options for finding campsites. Unfortunately, this app has almost nothing listed. Even long-established campgrounds and dispersed camping areas in national forest areas are missing. No state parks are listed either. I also looked in parts of Kentucky (zero listings anywhere in eastern Kentucky including around Red River Gorge) and only two in Montana (as I am considering a move there). Unfortunately, I paid for an annual membership that will basically go unused. The app has a lot of very good reviews, so I’m assuming it must be useful for a particular niche camping community, but for me, it’s not beneficial at all. | Easy | I was charged for an annual subscription after forgetting to cancel my trial. I was on vacation in remote areas and dealing with a lot personally. I totally forgot I had signed up for the Dyrt on 11/16 to play around with it. 11/16 was the only day I used it. 10 or so days later I tried to cancel and couldn’t get a refund because I was beyond the 48-hour grace period. I was expecting the Dyrt to be more understanding since this was over the long weekend of Thanksgiving. I would understand paying for a month but am bummed to pay over $30 for this mistake. And they won’t help over the phone, just email, where I seem to be getting the same canned responses from different people. | I think it’s funny that you guys’ ad shows & promotes “new places to camp for free” just to download the app & only see Tv camps then later find out you have to pay just to see them. One of the main steps to running a business is to be honest with your consumers. Do better | Paid for pro on Apple Pay and it never arrived no way to contact these guys who run this company the password would not let me in. Chase fraud will track them down | Don’t waste your time these guys are scammers plain and simple | Very helpful trying to find places to camp and park | Looking for some remote camping spots in Northern California. Was filtering the results it shows only 2 desolate camping sites in all of California. Also when looking at a site the app will say “pet friendly” and “available” but when you go to the actual campground site it shows fully booked and pets not allowed. | This app is totally useless. I took a trip driving to 49 states and 49 capitals in almost 1yr time period and not once this app came in handy. Google map does better | I Paid for pro but I do not get the pro benefits and there is no way to contact the dyrt . Do not pay for pro | Don’t tell this app that your residence is on an oil derrick in the Gulf of Mexico.  If you do, you’ll get nothing from this app.  This developer seems to think you will only camp around where your residence is.  Complete morons.  

(I live in Dallas, but GPS/location service use by this app keeps me locked to camping around DFW…again complete morons) | I think you have a great service and an awesome app. But if every other screen is a full screen pop-up about signing up for the pro service then it negates my enjoyment of the app. Once a session should be plenty of alert, but having a continuous stream of reminders seems like an anti pattern. Unfortunately have to look elsewhere. | They will charge your card even if you cancel BEWARE!!!!!! | Within the last few updates they have changed the app to where you can no longer find free campsites without paying for their upgraded pro version. Ridiculous, this app used to be really useful, but they have become just plain greedy. Your better off using a free alternative. | When I first started using this app three years ago it was great for finding dispersed camping. now if you want to utilize any of the information on the app you have to upgrade to the pro and pay for it. Amazing how popularity make it so you change for it. | I downloaded the app and signed up for the free trial. I’m glad I did, because I could check camping spots in my area. Since I could barely find any, I cancelled my membership, because it really didn’t offer me options for places to go. It advertises a lot of free campsites, but you have to first check it they’re available in your state. | Super friendly.  A few hours before I arrived, I recevied a call from the owner asking what time I expected to get there.  She told me to call her when I got there, she meet me and escorted me to the site.

One thing is for certain, the prices are too often bogus. Crossing town to save money is important these days. But people are gaming the system to screw others or draw you in to their station. The prevalence of this suggests gas buddy is not removing users who miss report gas prices. Not only are gas prices misreported; but, some stations don't even exist! I just went to a station claiming $4.15 for regular (updated over 8 hrs ago)....it's $5.15 - and has been all week. | Need ethanol free option. | We drive a lot and make cross country trips every year. Locating gas stations with Gas Buddy has easily saved us hundreds of dollars since we started using it. | Unable to change my profile user name info | I have been a member since long time… but from the last application update gas deal alert is not working. Every time after using a gasbuddy card I have to send an email to the customer service and request a refund. It’s really frustrating!!! I believe it’s a time to say goodbye… | I don’t understand how this card works or how to use it? | Can’t find what’s needed your help isn’t help can’t find login to my account. To difficult to report card lost | Love this app , I enjoy doing the challenges most especially since I like to cruise around a lot. I recommend this app and signing up. | They want too much information about you. Why? They don’t need your life information just to help you find a good price on gas. | This app is absolutely not dependable. Gas prices reported are not accurate and usually less than actual price. Perhaps retailers are setting up false lower prices. Whatever the issue you cannot depend on these prices anymore. | Been a member since 2016, used the GasBuddy card to get Deal Alerts up till now (2024) but since May only been getting 2 cents off per gallon vs the advertised deal alerts.  Customer service, once you realize you have to respond to the automated email, still takes a while and they automatically think you did it wrong. On 2nd fill up I took screenshots and kept receipt to show I did it correct, but they ignored it for what the system says(which is obvious wrong from the evidence shown.)  I’ll update review if fixed, or I will no longer use the service and leave this as is. | I wanted to use this app to be able to find a gas station with Vacuums in my area. It combines vacuums with compressed air so I ended up going to 3 different gas stations, none of which had a vacuum and only had compressed air. Good concept but those items definitely need to be separated. | The app has a few flaws as far as cheaters are concerned. There are some people that report prices within minutes of 5 to 8 locations in my town that will take me 10-14 minutes driving time. There is NO way they can do this. If the app is giving free gas and points then the app is being cheated. Further more I have found the not all (regular, mid-grade, premium) gas prices are correct due to people driving by checking all the boxes and not being at the pump and actually seeing the price. 
    Otherwise it is a great app, but the some of the users .&#%= | Always gives me the lowest price on gas nearby. Would love to see the Trip Calculator added to the app with details on as stations along your trip to wherever in the continental US. | You’ll save about $2.00 a year and pay $15 in surprise fees, do the math. | Good concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Must close and click many buttons in order to find gas.

Also, I’d like the app to allow me to save several favorite stations, not just one. | Gas buddy started out so useful, people being honest, trying to help each other out. But now it’s almost impossible to be able to trust the prices on here, even when you submit your own, the app will not give the price you submit, but it will “adjust” it assuming everyone has the “special discounted deal”at each station they stop at.
Plus I’m tired of giving so much time to helping this app and never getting back anything for it. | Been saving cents for awhile. It takes forever to get to $20 then find somewhere in the fine print money expires. The card works perfect and is great for a couple day delay on the debit from your bank account. Helps to keep track of spending if you use the app every time. But…can’t get a reward to save my life. 😔 | This used to be a great app but three weeks ago when they updated it,  it does not work and customer service is even worse because emails go unanswered. The app keeps showing wrong gas prices and when you try to update the gas prices it reverts back to the wrong price. Maybe you should invest a little bit more time into customer service and fix the app. | I’ve been a Gas Buddy member for many many years, and love reporting and researching prices. In general, the updates have been helpful, except for the latest Wendy’s ad. It’s messy and super slow to load, so when I click on the station below to update pricing, I almost always end up activating the Wendy’s ad, instead. Then, I have to close Safari and switch back to Gas Buddy. It’s SUPER annoying. | I installed the app a couple days ago for the sole purpose to find UNL88 (unleaded 88 or E15) fuel in my area since there’s only one Racetrack Gas Station where I can get it, but I moved from West Palm Beach to Lake Park and I gotta drive 10 miles to that gas station. 
I checked on the app and the racetrack it said had UNL88 doesn’t have it. I then drove to the one I always go and checked the app when I was close and that gas station never showed up. 
You guys need to correct this issue and it would help to have an option in the app to report these kind of situations, so you can add a gas station or update the information in your database. | GasBuddy is helpful in finding better prices, but I’ve consistently found that discounts promised on the app at gas stations that are not national or regional are not actually applied. I’ve received some “rewards” for submitting prices but these have been worthless. I don’t have an occasion to shop at blahblahblahboutique.com, so those gifts go unclaimed. A Master, Visa or Amazon gift card (or free gas?) would be more useful, at the risk of it being more likely to be redeemed. | This app is great to quickly find local gas prices. Gas Buddy, one suggestion is to add a gasoline category for 100% gas (no ethanol). Thanks! | There’s no economic reason for the fluctuation of prices here in California. Look up the eia. Gov for sources of our cleaner gas. Greed from the independent stations not the corporate entities have made a virtual inflated market where no price competition exists only price gouging. How else can you explain a $.40 to $1.00 jump within an hour. More and more this app is misleading and is useless when I look up a station, drive to it, and the price is off by $.30 or more. And I pay cash to get the lowest price.better business bureau needs to look into both the app and independent stations because consumers are paying too much for a gallon of gas, before our$.52 gas tax per gallon | 1/2 the time after activating offers, the gas buddy card doesn’t work at the activated gas station - so ridiculous!! | I have had great luck with this app, but it really needs to be available on CarPlay to be of utmost use. | Almost every gas station I’ve been too that has buddy shows me on their maps has been declining my gas buddy card. What’s the point of having this app & card if you can’t use it at the gas stations they recommend you to?!? | The pas several times I used the Gas Buddy card, the price I paid is higher than listed in the application | I’ve been a GB user for several years now. I use the GB card pretty much exclusively. The app used to have the discount button front and center. One of the last updates has moved the discount button down in the gas station section. Now you have select the gas station and click further into the particular station you’re at. You need to stop changing with the UI for no reason. Move the discount button back to the top and I’ll rate this 5 stars | This app has cost me more money in gas wasted driving to the cheapest gas per the app only to find out that the listed price was not only incorrect, but often times higher than the average price at other gas stations. | Very very slow. 

Costco gas prices not showing up. | Just delete the app they support CHIAN | Why can’t I activate my gas savings??? | I think it’s a great app, but they need to have an easier way if you lose your card to be able to cut your card off instead of jumping through multiple hoops, or have a way to contact somebody to talk to a representative to be able to disconnect your card or be able to send you a new one and alsoyou will have a gas buddy card link to Apple Pay or android pay would be nice as well. Update it some more. | PLEASE ADD DEF AT THE PUMP AS A FUEL TYPE OR AMENITY SO I CAN SORT LOCATIONS AND SAVE EVEN MORE MONEY

Otherwise I love this app and use it all the time.  For context, I average 50-60K miles a year on the road and I have saved a bunch of money using this app. | GasBuddy should change the name of their app to ad-buddy. What a waste of time. Instead of focusing on adding more ads, why don’t you focus on accurate gas prices?? | Your software indicates I have mail however when i try to read my mail the software indicates I have nothing. The ability to indicate gas price is not available. Even though I have highlighted several gas stations are my favorite I still have no way of using them. I have to find them in a highly crowded map. | Show me the largest worthless app, you get zero gas savings, they just want all your personal information | I used GasBuddy years ago for all of my gas purchases and saved a lot of money on gas. I just started working with DoorDash and I’m starting to work with Uber soon. It’s going to be a great way for me to save money for my business expenses! And find the best gas prices! | Have asked for a new card as my card does not work half of the time. Good discounts but can not access them due to a bad card read | Seem more and more I’m seeing prices not updated for days. I wouldn’t go far out of way chasing a price posted on this app. | All I want is ethanol free gas. No filter to look | I have used this app for years but it is basically useless now without a way to check gas station owners lying about gas prices | I have always liked GasBuddy, but recently, the app does not show an activate button. It will not allow me to activate any deals, then after the transaction, I get a notification that I could have saved more if I activated a deal. I have the latest version of the app, I have removed the app and reinstalled, signed out and in.. nothing has seemed to fix this issue. | I used to tell everyone to use this app but now I am upset with them. A gas station near me reopened after remodeling nearly 2 months ago and gas buddy will not list them. I have reported it to them many times snd they still refuse to add it back in the line-up. Now I have found another more trustworthy way of seeing prices near me. | Yeah so gas buddy is the only thing I’ve signed up for recently, and I’ve been getting spam calls NONSTOP. sometimes 40 in a day. Do not give the people your info unless you wanna switch phone numbers. | After paying for plus membership they never give me the discount I was supposed to get still waiting an nothing yet I send a email not reply back, costumer service horrible I just wish I get the money back | Only shows where to get premium. Only supports 91+ octane. It does actually tell you the octane rating of the pump. So it makes it really hard to fine 93 octane for my car. 91 causes pre-detonation. | I pay for a subscription. Why am I being limited on buying gas? | Favorites icon is too small. If you have fingers like a child it’s ok otherwise when you think your pressing it your actually pressing the large icon. Not sure why they make Favorites so small. 

Very handy to find best prices for gasoline. Uses user input for gas prices. Only issue I have is with every new version it seems like the ads get bigger and more frequent. Update 2/22/21: went to 1 star because when using favorites or find gas option the app no longer shows the price range from the lowest to highest for the stations being displayed.

It i as awesome for sharing photos within a group. | I have used this app since 2017. It makes it so simple to share photos from events, travel, and gatherings. PhotoCircle is easy to use, both to share photos and save photos. My family and friends are scattered throughout the world. The technology allows us share moments with one another PRIVATELY. | You are telling me my email
Address is INVALID!!!!!
WRONG!  Only one I have with
Apple phone & IPad🤣 | Great way to share with an immediate circle. | This is a great a bc I just had a StuCo trip and all parents & kids signed in and now there is like 800 pics for anyone to see | Love being able to share all your photos with a group of people traveling together! | Really beautiful | This is a great way to share photos with family; however, the ad said it allows only the people you invite. The only problem with that is the people you invite can invite anyone they want. You have not control over how the circles are shared. | Perfect if you’re not into social media but have family you want to stay connected with. | love the app but it would be cool if it had an option to turn all the photos into a slide show. | Our school uses this app to share photos taken throughout the year. It great for making yearbooks. All the photos are in one place and we don’t overload anyone’s phone with photos. | This app is great! However, it is missing a couple of features… you can’t mute a particular person. I get so many notifications that I don’t want to get from one person. You show also be able to mute a specific group, well you can’t do that. If that’s incorporated then it would make this app a 5 star review until then it’s not. Don’t get me wrong this app is amazing and for everything that it does and the ability to share with our loved ones and friends is a blessing! Please give us the ability to mute a group and individuals. | mannn i love this app sm. never ever deleting it.. if u run this app and u made it, cumere and lemme kiss u | Best in the world for clean, controlled social media. Would like to ask for a feature that allows users to pin specific circles to the top? thanks!! | Good communicator highlighting every phase of construction with his timely videos. Explains every phase of construction process n what to expect with the next phase | I love this app SO much there is no more to say download it!!!!! | I had a problem loading PhotoCircle after it had been working for a few weeks. The tech support person and I went back and forth for around 90 minutes. They figured out that my VPN, even though it was disabled, was blocking me from accessing the app. Thank you for sticking with me and I apologize for getting a little testy 😞 | As a Tour Manager I love using this app so my guest can share their photos together.
If there was a way to place a comment by the pictures it would make it perfect! | Ever sense I found out about this app I use
It for each play I’ve been in. It’s an easy way to share photos with everyone. It can have lots a people to going one section and add photos. The photos don’t distort at all. If you have an up coming activity I would use this app to share photos. | I LOVE THIS APP! it’s so easy to use and convenient, I would say that making it so the live photos stay as lives would make it even BETTERRRR!! | Has too many adds | Can no longer access any albums. App tries to open, screen goes gray, then the app closes. | This was a great site but the advertising wreck it. | Living over 200 miles while our new home is being built we are up to date thanks to our project manager Joe of the progress of the build 👍 | Too confusing to use | The ads make the platform almost unusable as a picture sharing platform.  Had the ads been embedded as they are when we first got on the platform I would never have chosen it. Rather a bait and switch to attract users as a private free platform and then monetize it. | I love how everything works out pretty smoothly | This is a joy! I love being able to see the grandchildren who don’t live close. 
Thanks | Photo circle used to be amazing. It was seamless, easy to use, etc. Since incorporating ads, it’s gone downhill.

I’m fine with ads but the way they incorporated it has made the app clunky and difficult to use. Oftentimes the ads will automatically take you to the App Store when you don’t even click on anything. 

Really terrible and disappointing. I’ve started looking for a new app. Don’t bother with this one. | Lit pictures of ur team! Highly recommend | My favorite app! | I wish your app could go into my contacts to add my friends to follow my PhotoCircle | Too many ads.   Ads keep playing after you have already scrolled past them, other than that not too bad. | Helps to document our journey🤙🏾 | I just read some reviews and my experience is that it opens quickly, the pictures are easy to see, and the advertising was not too intrusive. That said, after about three months, I did pay for it because I HATE ads. I figure if I pay for it, they may not add more advertising, and it will stay good for all. 

Wonderful way to share photos from multiple people - so far we’ve used it for: a vacation, funeral, other vacation, graduation, and a family party. 

To developers: Keep it simple to reduce bugginess. 
FREE VERSION TIP: people pay for data and a video ads could be reason they remove your app  
PAID VERSION IDEA:  If I could sort photos, and/or set a cover photo it would be even better
ALL VERSIONS: don’t sacrifice the great product you have now for some thing flashy and DEFINITELY don’t put more advertising! | Best app!!! Use this all the time. | App works good for showing customers photos of progression on the job | This app is such a great way when you have so many different people in different places and you can connect with your family and friends with photos and videos | I’m a photographer for my schools yearbook and I had been looking for an app like this—one where I can put all my pictures in one place and people can download the ones they want. It’s perfect and I love the commenting feature. The ads aren’t unbearable and are very scarce. Great app! | Love it and the updates | Too meany adds otherwise nice app | Share photos with family and enjoy each other’s experiences. Works well and are happy with it. | I love using the PhotoCircle app for organizing my photos and using for business purposes. | It’s a cool app, but the amount of advertisements can be excessive and it makes the user experience a lot worse | I wish there wasn’t so many adds and I don’t like that you can add the same photo twice 
Besides that I think it’s amazing and a great app | I found Photo Circle a little over 4.5 years ago when our first grandchild was born, & it's an AWESOME way for the family to share. Highly recommend! | I don’t ever get tired of these pictures of all of you. Jamerson is so  cute I just see him growing and see him doing new things in these pictures. Would like to see more of my sweet Abby also and mom and dad also.  Love you all Nanna | This app is fantastic! 
The most recent update (August 2023) now includes iPad support.  THANK YOU DEVELOPERS!

Who made this - KIA??   Get it together, BMW. | Before i got this I had to keep going outside to see when my charge will be done.  Now i get a notification on my phone that tells me to umplug | I took delivery of my 2024 BMW X3 M40i in Germany in Feb 2024. Upon delivery, I noticed that none of the myBMW apps were loaded… and wouldn’t load. So, at the suggestion of my salesperson, I drove down to Schaffhausen, Switzerland to see if my X3’s apps would automatically update, since there seems to be an issue with Germany’s/the EU’s data protection policies. Well, it worked. My apps and the Data Privacy option in the menu finally appeared, like out of nowhere. I was able to set everything up and actually use it. However, as soon as I re-entered Germany, my ability to use those features stopped. Features like being able to view what’s going on around my X3 via the cameras, the ability to send destinations to vehicle’s navigation system, the ability to plan climate control and remote start, the ability to lock/unlock, remote start on demand, honk the horn, turn in the headlights, etc. are all disabled now. Additionally, the built-in nav doesn’t provide any traffic updates. I’m sure that in the U.S. the features would work as advertised. However, I’m writing this review based on my experience here, not on what I believe would be my experience elsewhere.

UPDATE: All of the aforementioned features appear to be functioning now. It’s weird… and I can’t explain it. I’ve updated the star rating to five because it now works as intended. We’ll see if it continues to do so. | I really enjoyed purchasing my first BMW from Passport BMW . My sales person Jordan Riley was excellent with his service. The atmosphere made me want to purchase Two Cars. Thank you Passport BMW | For now on i will call to make a payment , i went to make a payment and it automatically charged me for the next month prior without my consent which is fraud. I called and they told me there was nothing they can do about it. So from now on i have to call to make a payment to record. It’s a shame because the app was a faster process but it’s not worth being charged double for no exact reason. | Electric vehicles have low ranges. I am afraid to go out of town in case I run out of charge. In 2 years I have logged 7522 miles. I drive my internal combustion engine. I was promised free charge for 2 years for Electrify America. Ever time I went to a charging station there were 4-5 cars ahead of me waiting for their turn. That’s a lot of wasted time. So I would return home to charge. I regret purchasing this BMW i4. | Great SUV the 4.0 is fast and gets good gas mileage.  The 4.0 runs very smooth and sounds great.  The interior is very nice and comfortable for drivee and passengers.  The interior has plenty of leg room and head space.  Like the entire inside look including dash and electronic shifter.   Sun roof is huge and extra rear sun roof above third row a great design.

Exterior is very nice look and has some nice design features.  My color is black Safire which looks great overall but has not warn well, many swirls in paint and some imperfections.  The paint job on my 2020 is not the best.  My other issue is no air ducks in third seat.  Only get those with addition of 5 zone A/C.

Overall great SUV and very happy with 20 plus miles per gallon. | Works ok mostly but can be buggy with incorrectly claiming charging cable is unlocked.
Also ,does not update status as it should (shows status from hours ago ) | My BMW App is very useful but, lately, I see a large grey band after the My Trips section and I have to scroll down for at least 60 seconds before I can see the Charging section ! I tried removing and reinstalling the App but the bug is still there. I hope BMW will fix this bug soon. | Not accurate time | Amazing | When I try to add my car, it won’t show up in the app even though it tells me it was  successfully added.
Makes the app useless. | App is great except it’s been saying I need to service my tires for 5 months now, I’ve gotten them serviced twice and I’ve taken it to two different locations to get it removed and none of them have been able to do it. Needs to be a notification that can just be cleared or overwritten | The app itself works fine I guess but the vehicle connection is very slow or non-existent.  Th location won’t update for days and it takes 30-60 seconds to send a command to the vehicle.  The car has 4G connectivity built in there’s no reason it should take that long. | I love the app, however I have not been able to see the financial services link in the app since I’ve traded in my older BMW for the 2024 i5 edrive 40. Not sure why it disappeared but I pay my bill with just one tap using the app, so not having it is a bit of an inconvenience. I’ve tried to contact app support it have been unsuccessful. | Excellent app with all the features we can think of | Just advised someone the 7 series is far and away more advanced than the Mercedes | Car doesn’t accept charging profile thanks to recent update | Was working but stopped as of the last iOS updates for real time battery updates | Before last app update, I was able to see live data, i.e. how long for a full charge, battery level, etc. Please fix! | Latest version not properly displaying SOC from vehicle. | Like the app overall. 
I have an i4, and it’s important for me to be able to check whether the car is charging and even when not charging - to know how much juice is left in the battery. 
Unfortunately since April 6, 2024 this functionality is no longer working. The other BMW community members report the same problem. 
All other parts of the app seems to work normally. | After the last system update, the app is not updating correct information. Has become useless. | The charge level and any other charge related data stopped updating, everything else works. Buggy update for iX / EV owners. Not a very stable code base and or poor regression testing. The amount of forums about how to reset this and that on BMW apps and iDrive is just amazing. For a company of this caliber you have to get this under control | Can no longer see if my car is charging and inaccurate battery percentage as of Saturday night all electric BMW owners reporting the same issue in United States | For the past 48 hours the state of charge is not updating on the app screen, however the notifications are still working when charging starts and when target charge is achieved. | MyBMW app is a very useful especially for an EV to schedule charging time at home and departure time. However, it seems like the app does not receive updates from the car. For example, on my i5 the current state of charge of the vehicle is not updated on the app. I hope this can be fixed. | All worked well until Saturday night. Fuel level, range, and battery state of charge are frozen in the app. All other app functions work. | As of other companies have faster and efficient applications | …battery charging state and level reporting is broken in the app | The App worked fine until I accepted the most recent update. Now, the status of the charge for my electric car is chronically wrong.  The car says it is 100% charged, the Charging History thinks it’s 100% charged, the main app view thinks it’s 60% charged.  How they missed this bug I can’t imagine, but it’s pretty egregious. | Amazing app until recently an update broke the SOC update function. | For the past day or two the charging status won’t update on my i4 m50. Talked to a bunch of other owners and they are all having the same problem | I can’t stress enough how frustrating is software from BMW. As much as I love driving the car that much I hate the software.
Everything is half-done. You can request cameras to take photos but it you will spend forever to download them. You can schedule the departure and do a pre-conditioning but you can’t get the climatization work right now. Working with maps is a nightmare, planning a custom route is impossible. It is impossible to remotely close the sunroof or windows. You have camera in the car, you have seat sensors and yet you don’t allow the elementary functions in the app. The car color is off in 3d view. Financial information sometimes works sometimes doesn’t. The video recorder data cannot be accessed via the app. Useful information and controls require a few steps while other things are on the spot. For example trips summary exists but route is not available. Maybe I liked some place I want to check it out. | Been using this app for over a year. Worked until now . I pay for the upgrades and it stopped working a couple days ago. Won’t update the charging. Car works but definitely won’t buy another BMW as they have no support. Other reviewers seem to be rigged. | Not able to read i4’s current mileage and charge! What’s going on? | Charging profile fail error since latest update was installed. Fix the bugs before you put out an update. | Since having my first BMW in 2008, I will not own no other brand. I am an owner and customer for life ❤️

Ms  Carolyn | The M2 is the best sport car I’ve owned-quick, responsive, and great breaks.  The bad news It’s been in for service for a week—electrical problems. The car has 2800 miles.   The dealership, Creavier was very responsive to try to fix the car.  I would recommend them if it broke again. | I recently purchased a 2016 750Li..My ignorance plus the incorrect info from the salesman at the BMW dealer led me to believe I’d be able to do many functions with this app. As it turns out,after paying 100 bucks,that the only remote function available to me was the ventilation function. No remote start,no remote climate controls etc..My model year doesn’t support these functions,which is fine,however,there should be different pricing for vehicles that don’t support all the functions.

App itself is rather slow,sending an unlock or lock command takes minutes. Other than that,app is ok. I wouldn’t have paid 100 bucks just to ventilate the car lol. | The charging experience with the app is really bad. Data is always unavailable, so can’t use the free charging, I have to pay by my own card otherwise it won’t work. This issue happens from time to time and is annoying. Also, for some reason when I search for a nearby charging station, it shows that I am in New York, which I am on a totally other side of the country. Just not a pleasant app to use. | So… with the new update I’m ready to give back my BMW car and its brand new 2024 . The new update doesn’t allow me to use Apple car play and I tried restarting the whole car system as well as connecting and disconnecting my Bluetooth from my phone . My bmw app doenst work anymore I can’t even heat up my car from my phone anymore it gives me error . Basically all the functions are now error . I really am ready to give back my car with the stupid BMW app update . PS: my car is new , my phone is iPhone 13 Pro so it’s not old and it’s fully up to date, and I’m tec savvy I tried everything . Hopefully they fix these issues . I also noticed that when you use another VPN the app doesn’t work either and I often use a VPN on my phone for work, and the app doesn’t work I have to disconnect from my VPN to access the app . Common BMW I expected better . | I recently purchased a 330i and received an alert that a firmware update was available. 

After seeing that the upload was completed as well as the firmware installation, I removed my key fob and cellphone. Later, however, I noticed in the MyBMW app showed that the installation didn’t occur. 

Customer service was able to detect that the firmware installation *was* successful and that the app was incorrect. 

Hopefully, we will see an update that resolves this issue—soon! | Great! | I used to be able to lock my car 640x remotely and check the vehicle status. With this new release all that was lost. What happened? | Obviously no car app is as advanced and capable as tesla app. But this bmw app is pretty useful! | My app is updated and I still dont have the financial section option.

It was open 6 am to midnight. No answer at SpotHero at that time so I booked another garage. 
They did respond to my email later in the day and after speaking they issued a refund as a SpotHero credit, which was not made clear to me | Beyond saving money, I like the comfort and security of knowing I have a parking space, especially in unfamiliar locations. The app also shows you a picture of the parking facility and links you to directions. It’s very convenient. | We made a booking an hour ago at a garage in West Village, NYC. When we arrived with our car, we were surprised to see that it was a tiny covered lot with only about 20 spaces  and it was full.  We were annoyed at SpotHero to let us make a booking.   The attendant made up some story that “go around the corner to this garage and it will honor our spot hero booking.” we went around and this new garage had nothing to do with the parking lot earlier, but the attendant was nice enough to let us make a new spot hero booking on the fly so that we only had to pay $28 instead of his usual $40.   SpotHero app did not let me cancel the earlier booking nor gave a refund. My husband was saying that he has stopped using the app because this happened to him a couple of times already.  Very disappointing.  I’ve been using SpotHero for years now. Need to find a better app now. | Easy to have plans before going to my event. Much cheaper options than if I waited until I got to the parking lot | I just paid $10 more than the lot in the app. Worst of all they posted inaccurate info on the lot saying it was assisted when only true for part of the day not the whole reservation time. I will not be using again! | Please ensure the parking lot will take cars. On Friday we were told we could not park! My wife will call to get the refund. I had to find another parking lot. | I needed a refund and it was done automatically, very easily | I like spothero | Parking garage was easy and convenient to get into.  Vehicles were safe and secure.  However it took almost 45 min to exit due to all the traffic congestion after the Giants game.  I use Spot Hero all the time and will continue to do so! | So the actual price you pay through the app and what you could pay if you went directly to the parking lot is sometimes a win and sometimes a loss.  It used to be a win. For example, today I paid $18 plus a service fee and I’ve could’ve gone there and paid $14 and no service fee.  So in the future, I’m going to compare this to the pricing on other similar applications and for example at Yankee Stadium I now have a place that I can go to that’s five dollars and 75 cents cheaper than SpotHero. So as they say in baseball, some games, you win some games you lose, and some get rained out. | Extra excellent are your Super Agents (personnel) extremely cooperative, efficient and kind | Spot Hero app is wonderful every time I use it it’s easy and user friendly. I highly recommend it. | SpotHero is easy. Remembers me. Hastle Free!!! | I have always had a positive experience with the services provided | DO NOT USE THIS APP! There was no parking on arrival and they do not refund or give credit! It's a scam and they take your money. I booked a spot in NYC to arrive at 1:30pm for an event and leave at 8:30pm. When i reserved it, around 9:30am, they defaulted the start time to 8:30am and leave at 11:30pm. It was not possible to change it. This is a problem when you arrive at 1:20pm and the garage  say ""we have no space!"" It is not possible to cancel (as the parking time has started!)  or even get a refund. The parking attendant said never use Spot Hero! I tried calling (was a Sunday) no one picked up. My  husband parked somewhere else. I got a hold of customer service after a few days later and said they would credit me. I do not want to use them again and asked for my money back. They said I would be refunded in a few days. They haven't refunded me but sent an email instead saying they will credit me. It's been 10 days and still no credit. | Been using it regularly for a few years. The app and customer service have NEVER disappointed! Very reliable, and whenever there was an issue (like garage being full) the customer service has been excellent. | We wasted a half an hour following the instructions given by the website and by the representative, and there was no such garage. | Use spot hero and save yourself time money and the aggregation of trying to park, not to mention getting a parking ticket. | Great app with great parking deals.  Way cheaper then parking when you arrive. | Have used them twice to fly out of Hobby. Everything worked easily and like clockwork. Made my trip much more enjoyable. Very helpful and professional staff. | Photos of parking space not shown. I want to see where I will be parking. | Their review system isn’t giving them the feedback they need. When a parking garage oversells and turns you away, the reservation gets cancelled and you can’t review the garage for doing the bad thing. In my case, I made a reservation a week ahead of time because I knew it would be hard to park - and sure enough, the garage had already sold the last spots when I arrived and turned me away despite the prepaid reservation. The attendant said he’d been turning away people all week.

Yet the garage to this day is still on the app with a five star rating - because only people who actually got served get to rate the place, not the people they screwed. 

As a result, there’s no actual way to tell which garages are good and bad on the app, making the app useless.

Note that they always say in their responses here “you should have called or contacted us at the time.” I did. They left me on hold for over 20 minutes before I had to give up or I would have missed the event I booked the parking space for. They did eventually respond to email and refunded it but…and this is crucial…then I couldn’t leave the bad review for the garage because now it shows as “cancelled” in my app!

As a result, I don’t trust any of their reviews and can’t find good garages that won’t turn me away. | I’m very pleased with the parking that is so close to where I need to be.  Most of all the staff is awesome & very helpful . | I wasn’t able to get the QR code to work so I had to do a ticket which was half as cheap as their service.  When I called to get customer service, they had me email a copy of my ticket and receipt and I have not heard back since. They have ignored my follow up emails. I would not recommend or will I use again. | Gave a range instead of point and could not locate lot | I have had an excellent experience using my Spot HERO app. It is my go to app for parking. If there is ever an issue, the customer heroes are ready to help. | The parking attendant went out of his way to drive our car to the street. He was very amicable too. | This app would be amazing if they made 2 changes:

(1) require the same policies for all garages.  Having some lots allow extensions and others not, and then having it change without warning has been confusing at best,  absolutely infuriating at worst.  Also, having different policies and procedures makes the rate for user error considerably higher.  I’ve spent more money in fees and fines from these bizarre rules than I would if I had just paid for parking normally. 

(2) the customer support needs serious improvement.  Having the driver behind me get increasingly enraged when I was stuck in the garage unable to leave or backup when the app didn’t work was terrifying.  

Until these changes are made, I won’t be using this app. | Very convenient indoor parking in downtown Atlanta reasonable price easy to use your app on phone to book and get in and out | We use this garage for the times that we will
 be away for  4 to 6wks.  A few times i
didn’t book early enough and had to park elsewhere. They are always nice. The price is usually not the definitely lowest price but it seems to be one of them.. and I think it’s the best for the price | There is no address to say “751, 2nd Street NE”. Even the words LAZ parking is hardly visible. Please please write the address on the board in front of the garage. This will help people to avoid going in circles like I did. Thank you. By the way, the garage attendant was very helpful and respectful. | App very easy the use and gives plenty of options for the area your going to. | It’s a great service in NYC to reserve the parking in advance. So far I was extremely happy wherever I parked. | Twice through the app I have booked parking only to arrive and have the parking attendant tell me they are full. SpotHero does not allow a refund in those cases. Selling parking spaces you don’t have is quite simply a scam. Obviously some blame goes on the parking lot, but why doesn’t Spothero make it easier to cancel, or better yet don’t charge until you’re actually checked in at the space? Why? Because they profit. Shameless and criminal enterprise. | Gave parking as 2min walk , was 14min 
Was not able to extend one hr on app or by phone with customer service 
Would not use again | I was in Columbus Ohio and did not want to pay excessive parking fees or high Uber prices so I found this app. The first lot I used went very well, no issues. The second lot was difficult to identify but I followed the directions from the app and their were several lots near each other. I was not familiar with the area so I trusted the app that I was in the correct lot. I ended up with a parking ticket. The second day I parked in a lot and was able to find any way to identify I had paid and did not want to get another ticket so I paid again to have a ticket on my dash. I contacted customer service and it took over two weeks to get a response to both my ticket and double payment. They did refund my double payment but as a credit on the app. The ticket they stated was valid because I was unknowingly in the wrong lot. I tried calling the customer service line and was on hold for over an hour. I emailed again but have not received a response yet. I doubt I’ll be using this app and again for fear of getting a ticket so my credit is useless. I don’t recommend using this app. I should’ve paid more for security or taken an Uber. | Twice now I ve discovered that the lots charge less WITHOUT the app. That’s not good! | Best price for parking in cities so far to date and east cancellation if anything changes | This app has to many issues as a iPhone user. They have so many UI issues that for an avid user it still gets confusing trying to decipher what all of the options are. Too many options that get mumbled together and makes the app really difficult to read . When trying to make ANY modifications the app just gives you an error with no possibility to copy and look up online. Trying to call customer support on a non busy day/weekend, I tried every option on their phone like to get CONNECTED TO ANYONE AND NO LUCK, HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE FOR HOURS AND NO ONE PICKS UP. What a joke for 24/7 365 support they definitely need to change that. And if it’s true they “they are too busy”, then that just shows you how many issues this app truly has with every user trying to contact them. I Travel often and this by far has had the worst experience with trying to do anything with this app. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! | 4th time repeat customer however, more overhead lighting needs to be added.  Very dark and sketchy especially on the first level.  Just a short walk to the stadium down 161.  Very reasonably priced. | Spot hero is so convenient and easy.  You get parking in a safe environment at excellent prices.  The only parking app you need is Spot Hero. | Easy in and out and great proximity to the Forum! Nice attendant! Great experience! | Best experience with parking app ever. Will use exclusively from this point forward | We drove into NYC for first time (after trains and busses in the past) and had a great experience with this app finding parking.  We reserved and bought the parking a week beforehand. At both locations (one uptown for a show, then one next to our hotel) it was simple and quick even if you  are a bit clueless. Tip them, plan ahead, money paid not too bad overall… in NYC!!! | Update: April 4. Received an email today that a credit has been issued for the problem listed below. I hope to use this credit in June. Updated stars to 3 for customer service taking care of it. If a positive experience in June, I will return to update further. Thank you…
—————-

I was booking a parking spot for June business trip. The app glitched and changed my date to today, before the current hour so I could not change the booking. Sent message to contact email, heard nothing. Cancelling the other dates needed. Very poor customer service, not to mention glitches that cause bookings that cannot be used. | Reserved a spot for $30 using the app well in advance of our event. A few weeks before the event, SpotHero refunded the $30 then charged us $50, without our permission. SCAMMERS!!!  We’re going to lodge a complaint with our state AG. | Absolutely awful customer service.  I booked a parking reservation which then would not let me enter the garage.  I asked for a refund and spothero claimed I tried to enter before my reservation started, which was not the case.  Stay away from these scammers | DO NOT PARK USING SPOT HERO. I made a reservation entering my vehicle information paid and parked. When I went to get my car the attendant charged me an additional $20 and spot hero did not stand behind their agreement on my reservation with them. SCAM discount site.
I have parked in multiple lots in the same general location and have never had this experience. I will never use SpotHero again, and I advise others the same. | Spot Hero would be very good if there was any support staff there! A garage refused to honor our reservation so I tried to contact Spot Hero both by calling and emailing. Nothing. Had to have credit card reverse transaction. | I like this app, but I like it less than I once did. Although prices have tended to be slightly higher than rival apps, many of those apps are unstable and a higher rate was worth it, given Spothero’s greater reliability. In the last several months however, the app has been kicking me out repeatedly, and forcing me to repeatedly sign back in - which is way annoying if you are entering a facility and have honking cars behind you waiting for you to sign in AGAIN so you can get to your bar code. I have noted online that many people are complaining about this. Please address this problem. I have loved the app, but now there is a situation where it is becoming similarly unstable as rival apps - at that slightly higher rate. Not a great combo. The interface remains superior to rivals in other ways, but the constant log in issue is maddening.

It is the only language-learning app that has a serious approach to learning a language, and it emphasises a lot on grammar, | I like that this app goes into detail about cultural aspects, and the fundamentals of why endings are changed. I don’t pay for premium, so I deal with all the ads, but it doesn’t let me review, and there isn’t enough repetition in the course progression to really understand fluently. So basically either I have to redo my budget to pay for this (which isn’t an option for me yet) or I can only learn a certain amount via this language app.

Update*
I did end up getting premium. I wish they had a family option like DuoLingo. I do like it in general, I’ve met some really nice people in the Busuu community, but I feel like it’s way overpriced. I’ve found a couple bugs, and haven’t been able to report them like they allow on Duo on the actual activity.

I think they need more repetition as they continue the lessons, or activities that solidify the knowledge you’ve learned, otherwise I feel like I have to spend more time in review than on new lessons. | Better than Duo Lingo actually teaches real life words and interactions, not just Apple and boy. Real French speakers also get to give you advice on your writing and speaking | A great multi language learning app from 0 to 100 | I’ve been using it to learn Korean, and it sort of randomly started asking me to read Hangul in the lessons. The only problem is that it doesn’t tell you “It’s time to start learning Hangul” it just throws you into it | Harika👌 | Muy dinámico e interactivo | I’ve tried them all. Busuu is the best. It’s the most comprehensive. The most user friendly. With vocabulary reviews and grammar reviews, you will learn fast and remember everything easier. One of my favorite features is the community tab where many of your completed lessons get graded by native speakers of the labguage you are trying to learn. You can also grade theirs who are trying to learn English or whatever your native language is. You can connect with people all around the world and learn languages at your own speed. Busuu is amazing. | love it | I’ve only used Busuu for about a week and I feel like I have learned more than a month in duolingo. I really like how the community can correct sentences you say or write and the explanations that are given in lessons about the words and how they can be used. I do wish I could learn the Japanese alphabets sooner so I could practice in them but other than that I have enjoyed using this app. | Very interactive, definitely glad I use it. The premium is worth it. | Awesome , wonderful and easy to navigate app. Love the fact you can set goals and get Reminders to stay motivated! Completely loved the 1:1 and group classes! | I just wanted to write here and needless to say, Busuu is awesome, if you’re starting to want to learn new languages, this is the right place to be!

Busuu is so better than any other language teacher app. You should try it, I recommend!

I currently can speak foreign languages (Spanish, English, Japanese, Korean, and American Sign Language) thanks to Busuu! 

Signed,
Harmony. | Thanks for your app | three days into it but i found the app from reddit, and it’s been really wonderful so far! | Best app for learning English and other languages | Está muy buena la app ya q es gratis aunq sea con anuncios esta re bien | I’ve been using Busuu for over a week now and it’s pretty nice, it’s helped me learn a good amount and it’s pretty fun too. I’ve been using Duolingo for a while and now I’m using both of these, but Busuu gives a much better explanation and native speakers that say words too. So it’s very well rounded and gives a lot of support and I really appreciate using Busuu! | I’ve found Busuu to be great for me. It works for sure. It all comes down to preference. No app is perfect but give Busuu a try🫶🏻👉🏻✝️ | Muy buena app es genial para aprender idiomas | ممتاز جدان انصح به | I wonder why can’t I see people in my community? | 👌🏽 | This is the best for teaching me useful conversational language. It is fun and interactive, too. :) | I learnt so much from bussu and soon will be able to have a full on conversation with family. Thank you! | This app is really good I didn’t think I’d be able to memorize anything for my future trip but I’m really getting the hang of it and love the app. | I love Busuu but there are a lot of ads unless you get premium, but overall the tells you everything like every small detail, overall I love it. | Not bad. but some bugs can be fixed | It is helpful to immerse yourself in the language and to understand grammar topics in practice | Amazing | better than duolingo | Easy to work with but the quiz it takes to show your lvl is not good | best language learning app | The feedback from practice is really encouraging and helpful in learning | I have been trying to learn korean since 2020 & I have tried others apps that just didn’t help me. But Busuu helps bring down the vowels , consonants & much more. | Of all the language apps I have tried, I find Bussu to be the most effective for my learning style. I am near 100% through all of French and have started Spanish and Chinese. I like how the lessons correspond to the A1-B2 levels of CEFR (Common European Framework). It would be nice if the Chinese lessons would correspond to HSK levels. It would be nice to always see the pinyin alongside the Chinese characters, but you can easily toggle back and forth. Lessons for A1-A2 are well developed and consistent for most Latin-based languages. However, content starts to slightly diminish with a few errors once you get into the later courses B1-B2. If they can be more consistent, provide more content, and fix these minor glitches—I would give this app 6 stars! After 18 months, I have reached an intermediate level of French using the app as my foundation for grammar and basic vocabulary (I have not used a textbook). I plan to use this app for many years to come. Definitely worth the value! | Good | the best | I love the app and it is very good and useful although you will have to pay to learn more than one course. | Great app to learn as long as ur dedicated | Me encanta La recomiendo totalmente | I have an account, it won’t let me log in because it says I have to reset my password. Fine, so I’ve requested the reset link FOUR TIMES BY EMAIL AND TWICE BY TEXT and haven’t received anything. Yes, I’m certain I entered the correct email and phone number, yes I checked my spam and junk folders. I don’t even know if their material is good for learning languages because they won’t let me access it. | Nice app and tries to do its best Hope to see more progress 👌🏻 | I speak English and Spanish,

I wish lol. Besides that, very great app. 👍🏽 Please fix | Not impressed with fact that now you have to use there navigation and that’s the only option I payed for the subscription once and there was no benefits still has ads was waste of money | Customer service doesn’t exist so if you’re not wanting to keep it after the free trail good luck getting rid of it they will just keep billing | What happened to being able to run route on google?  I know they aren’t trucking …but really!!! | Thank you for your development, longtime subscriber I love what you guys are doing.

Can you please enable split view for iPad iOS?

Split view was very critical for my day-to-day use of Trucking
I’m unable to use navigation on Trucker Path because I can’t control my media. I’m stuck having to run two devices, which is very clunky and a distraction on the road. | I really like the app. It’s unfortunate there are some that ruin it for many. Too many times I look up available parking to see red (No parking) to actually show up and find parking available and should be reported Green. The app is losing its value because of false reports.  Losing my interest in this app. | I paid for the diamond membership a year ago. I used the app pretty consistently up until my subscription expired last month and discovered it had quite a few routing flaws. For the year, I used a combination of this app, Google maps, and my Garmin GPS for RVs. I set up my Garmin for truck height, length and weight and got better routing through that than I did this app. More than once this app tried to take me down roads that would’ve put me in a bad way had I followed it. It’s difficult to submit these types of app errors if you can’t screenshot the routing issue at the time it happens, especially when you’re in an area with an ‘80 rig that an 80’ rig shouldn’t be in (e.g., most major metro areas). All you’re worried about at that time is getting free of that area without incident.

In all honesty, I never reported the issues because it seemed pointless at the time. I couldn’t figure out how to recreate that part of the route and the options it was giving me during navigation. So, in the developer’s defense, they never had an opportunity to resolve the issues. But it happened enough times for me to lose confidence in the app for navigation purposes. 

I basically relied on my Garmin for routing, Google for traffic, and Trucker Path for truckstop, rest area, and Walmart locations. I did like that I could put in my route and my available hours and it would show me where I’d have to shut down. But that feature by itself is not worth $149 or $249. 

So, I’m sticking with what works. Oh yes, another very annoying part of this app is that even after you pay full boat on an annual subscription, they will continue to bombard you with their own ads for fuel discounts and whatnot. So, it’s definitely not “ad-free”. | I am a returning customer.   When I ended my subscription the customer care team reached out to me and asked why I no longer a customer.  I said it’s way too expensive for a navigation system that I don’t own.  
     Now I miss having trucker path and I use both my garmin and trucker path.  This app offers so much more than a garmin offers.  Trucker path also has better routes than my garmin.  I use both now and I love it. I edit my garmin to trucker path routes.  Using trucker path saved me several times for almost running out of hours.  It tells you if parking is full or many spaces available.  If weight station are open and if the offer over night parking.  This is a great app.  It is very well worth the money.  I’ve tried every free trucker navigation app out there.  This has them beat by far.  You get what you pay for.  This is top quality and paying for quality is worth the money .  If you have any doubts about this navigation system PM me and I’ll clear you of any doubts.  Buy the app it’s so worth it.  Sorry I ever left. | Best app for truck drivers!!! | I don’t like this updated version, it seems to make the directions more confusing, and still doesn’t route me correctly, that’s just my opinion for now, I’ll see how it pans out in the near future. | don’t know what’s going on but app keeps on taking it upon itself to jump to routing when i’m not even touching the phone. | The app is great but I was having a hard time figuring out how to route for Hazmat loads(avoiding bridges and tunnels) | The interface is so great and directions are super clear. With new update it’s even better. It’s hard for me now to switch to google when I drive my personal regular car lol. 

My suggestion. Do something with your report button to encourage other drivers report thing on the road. (like a waze)

And thank you again for such a great product.🙏 | We are really thankful to you for providing this best app, but we have one request. Please add. Gym option also along with route, so we can easily search for a gym like as TA pilot loves | Trucker path scammed me out of $500 on fuel through the trucker path app. DO NOT BUY FUEL THROUGH THE APP. You’ve been warned | Please check the app, the navigation mode didn’t show any facilities on the route, no truckstops no weight stations, please fix it as soon as you can I’m begging you!!! This app is my everything!! | I love the app it works well I just wish it was a way to check the notifications when some one ask a question without having to stop the navigation to respond | I have used this app for a very long time. I have ranted and raved about it before.
The new update messed up how you can route fuel stops making it a hassle. switching to Garmin. | Recently they stopped showing flying j and pilot at maps which is kinda annoying. | Great app. Some of the exits in the NE are wrong. I.E. i91 going into Vermont and some in Connecticut and Mass | Would be nice to see the option of diesel 1 when running the Midwest | Return the navigation back so that I can see the foot truck and weighing stations when navigation is on. It's very inconvenient that you have to turn off the navigator and view the stop | Yesterday may took me off the truck road and I was pulled by the officer. I would suggest map to update sooner so we don’t drive on off the truck route. | I have been using this app for 3 years but last days 
The app is showing wrong price on every single gas station. This is  not about  5 or 10   cents, 
It is up to 45 50 cents . | The apps doesn't work fine, what are we paying for?!?! | 1. Usually it works well as it should because it not free!. But why you want me to rate a trip, why!? It takes time! If it’s not perfect any driver will let you know!
2. 4-5 last updates making app worse.
3. When I approach exit the worst thing what can be is zoom in or out! It’s disaster! I missed more then 10 exits. For this you get 1 star from me.
4. Last update: I can’t see no any truck stop during navigation
Overall, using because no any other out there | I purchased the app, and it won’t let me use it. It keeps acting like it’s the free version and when I press purchase or restore-it says invalid receipt. I would love to give the app 5 stars but if I can’t use all features after purchasing then I won’t waste the time. | Love the app and use it often, but it doesn’t have CarPlay so at times I’m forced to use your competitor. | They had a free 7 day trial to try out with a lock symbol on it.  It literally says free 7 day trial…. They charged me $149 dollars. I’m beyond upset. I’m going to buy a normal truck gps and discontinue doing business with them. Misleading / advertising tactics to take money from hard working people. That’s literally my child support payments for the week. I’m so mad man. I hate this feeling of being robbed. The app is great hands down compared to all other apps on here. But this situation is costing them a loyal customer. 😭🙏🏽 Unforgettable | When not updated, many glitches and bugs. It can even take you to non truck routes and compass may not sync… | Really great app! And really good routes! | This truck gps is the best one that I have used but it has it flaws. Most commonly is exit signs that are incorrect, it tells you one thing and the sign says another. Second, I'm in New York and my truck fits in the Holland tunnel but I’m always directed to the Lincoln tunnel a huge deviation. But my biggest peeve is that when starting a new trip, it will add stops from your previous trip to your current trip. The number of times I’ve had to pull over just to confirm that I was not heading to the destination I wanted. The problem with the app is that when you select Quit Navigation it should clear everything out, it does not | We were trying to use this app to move our RV. And had we not pre tried out the route we deff would’ve been screwed. Not only did it have us going under very low power lines and a low overpass but it had us make a turn that was more than 90 degrees. Please do not get stuck in a situation because of this | It leads you to unnecessary roads so many tomes. | I’ve been using the diamond version for about a year and a half. It’s very accurate with low bridges majority of the time as well as truck restricted roads.  Still could use some minor updating though. At the end of the day, have to use common sense on something’s out there. 

The option to see if parking is available at rest stops and truck stops is spot on. Just wish more drivers would use it more to be 100% accurate but still good enough for me. 

The entrance and exit for shippers is 98% accurate which is more than I could expect so that’s a huge A+ and so important. 

Seeing if weigh stations are open, seems to be what most people focus on and I’m not mad about it. Being able to input speed within the preplanning is an AMAZING feature for planning out the trip. 

One of the biggest reasons why I continue using this app as my primary trucker GPS is the fact you can have the option for satellite view not only for when arriving at shippers/receivers but at all given time!

 A few things for the developers to focus on… First, make the speech more realistic. All of the voices are brutal to listen to, sounds like Macintosh computer animated.

 Second, the app crashes on my iPad. I keep it up on my iPhone and iPad but the iPad seems to be the only one with issues on a daily basis which is frustrating and distracting. 

Third, there should be an all in buy feature for this app. I’ve spent a lot of money with being a diamond member and there should be a cap. 

Overall love everything about it and would recommend it to anyone. Keep up the great work! | No. Too much. | This has always been a great app, and it seems to be getting even better! 
I have always like that it shows a satellite photo of every parking lot. Newest update makes it easier to see options down the road too. | Using this app has been a god send ,with the scales ,and truck spots helps all hours of the night | Please don’t buy a plan they will make u buy a plan then it will stop working 
I give them a call to see what was the problem and they gave me the runaround and never call me back they jacked me lol | I really love this app. It’s my go to for checking ahead for parking availablility. And it provides a lot more information about each place. 
Only wish more drivers would actually use it. | I use it every day it is extremely helpful especially when navigating off the interstate system | With android auto and apple CarPlay now coming in semis, can we get this app to work on that? Apparently developer responded, but the apps prof won’t show me. | What is going on with the Image? It’s blank on regular map and satellite map. You’re not able to see anything, streets, highways, nor building’s. As of 2/27/2024 I’ve had this issue. I’ve even checked for updates, deleted the app, and then re-installed. No change in the results after doing so.

*Issue resolved the following day. Appreciate the follow up. | The latest update is terrible, it is very difficult to see the lanes on the exit!!! And remove these red stripes, they are very confusing!! | Don’t download you can use without pay | TA travel center no longer appears on the map route | This app is keep on crashing all the time. Please fix this issue or give my money back. I do have gold membersip.

But now its working good👍🏻 | This is by far the best app I have found!! Thank you TP!! | Update review 3/2/24. The app has not glitched since troubleshooting. I use this app all the time and overall I am happy and will continue to use it. 

Couple of things I would like to see changed/fixed;

1) on occasion when trip planning, the app changes what I picked as the start location to my current location. This messes up all of the arrival and departure times. 

2) during map guidance, it would be nice to know that the route has been changed from the plan I set due to traffic conditions. More than once I have “fought” against the new route only to finally figure out what it was trying to do too late and get stuck in a traffic jam. Please give a pop up or notification or something saying Route change due to wreck/congestion. 

(Previous review below)
Up until this trip I have had good success with “Trucker Path“. I have been using it for about a month without any issues and loving the usefulness of the app. The night before this past trip the app started glitching when I was setting up my route for the next morning. I thought that was weird. I am going to go ahead and set up the company provided navigation system as a back up just in case. Good thing I did, because a few miles from my final interstate exit in an unfamiliar area “Trucker Path” completely glitched out and was useless. I was able to use the company navigation to get me to my final destination. So, when I got settled at my destination, I opened the chat function with the helpdesk, and they gave five different things that I could do to try to get the app to stop glitching. I had done the first four and the final fifth one was for me to completely uninstall the app, delete all of the data, and reload the app. They were hoping that would be what was needed to stop the app from glitching. Needless to say, I am disappointed in this app because now I have to set up Trucker Path and the company navigation in the future because I don’t feel like I can trust this app. That is more work than I really want to do, but there are some awesome features in “Trucker Path” that I love. I will do this for about a week or two and if the app is working correctly from now on, I will “eat crow“ and come back to this

From dinning to events in-board, the Carnival app has you covered. Despite a slight issue with checking into our early dining—which was more on the fault of a switch from any-time—everything ran flawlessly. We sailed on the Carnival Panorama and didn’t miss a beat of what was going on on-board and had the best time of our lives! Happy cruising! | I love being on the ship I especially love the room service I forgot the name of the man that service our room which is room 8382 he did a great job please let him know we appreciate him my name is Latin. | The app really helps in planning and keeping you updated before and after the cruise.  I liked that you could keep track of your expenditures as well as where to find the activities and restaurants .  We didn’t have any problems with the app itself.  

The chat feature was a different story.  It was horrible!  There was a group of 14 of us and we all purchased the chat.  Big mistake!  Most of the time it would not work and it would just go yellow.  You’d have to go back and reboot the app and you had your app back but most of the time, still no chat.  It got to be very frustrating for all of us. | loved it everything you need for the ship could be right in your phone | The app is great for reservations and finding activities.  We purchase the chat app but some people in our chat will not receive messages.  They haven’t log off and get back on to receive messages. I think the chat option should be free just because of the glitches it has. However $5 for the duration of the cruise not bad. | The app worked great! I needed a little training on the app to receive the full benefit but over all it was a great addition! | We constantly lost the wifi connection in our cabin that was in the first floor | Temperature wasn’t up to date. Froze for several days. Some days worked well. Some days I had to go to guest services for help and they had to troubleshoot it and reset it. | The app worked fine when the WiFi was working. I didn’t have to pay for WiFi just to use the app. Carnival should emphasize to customers how important it is to have the app on their phones, especially when it is time to get off the ship. My rating is 4.5. | The app was great, I loved being able to see what was going on around the ship. Being able to see all the food options as well as locations & times was great. It lagged a lot and it sent a weird “invitation” to my phone every 5-10 minutes, I had 531 notifications from just one day. Couldn’t even open the notification when you did check it. | Very good for use during the cruise stayed | The app works only when the WiFi works. | Made communication better | Works pretty good. Occasionally dropped the ships WiFi so messages wouldn’t load or go through. Overall though it worked well. Able to see menus and check in for dinner.  We could see all that was going on as well. | The app is very efficient and easy to use! Love it! | The app chat worked as long as you could stay connected to the ships internet.
The other features worked great! | We found so many of the amenities and shows through the app. The map as well as “what’s happening” tools were essential to our trip. 
We made friends on the ship but didn’t have cell service so we purchased the messaging for $5 and it was amazing to be able to communicate while doing our own activities. 
Having boat time was great. We would have been lost without the app for sure. 
Checking in for dinner was so easy through the app. | This was our first cruise. We absolutely loved having everything at our finger tips. | The app helped with the scheduling and helped me see what was for dinner | I didn’t know how we would communicate with one another once we were on the ship since I was the only one who purchased the internet package (the cheapest one) but the app includes a “chat” feature. Each person does have to pay $5 each but that’s the cost for the full trip, not daily. You can also “star” things you are interested in and the app will remind you when the event is coming up (no obligation to attend). 
Suggestions: 1) Add a “locator” so you can see where your loved one is without having to ask them “where are you?” because if your family member is swimming, for instance, they won’t see the message. Other cruise lines have this. 
2) Debarkation Day was messy. I registered us for a time slot of 840-900 am, & it told us where to gather. It didn’t say when so we went early since we chose to bring our own luggage & didn’t know how chaotic it would be. When we got there cruise employees told us we had to leave, go back to deck 10 (or 5?) and wait until the app told us when to come which didn’t happen until minutes before. It would be more helpful to have more instructions IN THE APP. Tell us what to expect, when to come, etc. | This rating is for what you can find on the ships stay connected including menus in the dining and all activities.

We did have problems staying connected, but could always get back on when we realized it had dropped. It would drop often. | Loved having everything right at my fingertips, made navigating the ship easier and choosing where to eat, the shows and what’s happening so much smoother! | We went on a 15 day cruise and the app worked great. We used the app to message each other and friends, loved having the app since I didn’t have the internet. | Just got back from carnival horizon. Apparently when booking, my account didn’t link with my reservations causing me to lose my points and gratitudes of a red customer. Never getting my credit of $50 since I never received my gift from booking. Now I still can’t link up VIFP number either.  Refreshing account numerous times doesn’t work either. Now to hopefully deal with an English speaking human in customer service. | Younger generations of cruisers speed thru this app making them the people in the know of all the fun activities and updates while on and off board. For the older generation of cruisers unless a little tech savvy would be glad to have a millennial or gen X or Z as there shipmates ya dig……. lol !!! | It works great for what’s happening, dinner menus and account balances but the $5 chat feature is not worth it it only works less than half the time and drops the ships WiFi and buffers the other half. It does not deliver messages until hours or days later. It also doesn’t let you check in more than 10 people for dinner and you can’t make reservations so you have to go to restaurant check in with hostess, wait and eat later if you have a group like we did. Lots of info on app and if you think you can unplug while on the ship someone in your party has to have app to do things for you like debarking. | The app is great, but paying $5.00 each to use the chat and it only works 40% of the time is disappointing. | Understandable we’re at sea and wifi can be spotty but is certainly did seem to go out often. Worked well when it would stay connected ! | The app and chat feature are convenient and super user friendly! Unfortunately, the group chat feature was not working the entire cruise which was a bit upsetting. You had to message everyone individually. 
We had an amazing server at the Meridian that we continuously went back to see (we had our time dining). There’s no way for us to request a specific server from the app so we had to physically go to the restaurant which would reset our wait to be seated. It was inconvenient.
Lastly, I would love to see the app go in a direction where it has its own social media available to everyone on the ship. That way I can easily interact with people, see who's where, post pictures, etc.
Overall, the app definitely makes the cruise experience better! These are just things I’ve noticed that would improve the already good experience. | It work good for us ! 
We also had a wonderful time ! 
This was our 6th cruise on Carnival GREAT SHIPS …. | In my opinion carnival is the best cruise line. I just went on carnival celebration and the staff were super friendly and the whole ship is so big!!!! I love the countdown on the app that tells you when your cruise is. It gets you so pumped up for your cruise! This app also lets you text your friends/family when your on airplane mode! Overall I just love this app I would recommend downloading this app!🙂🙂🙂 | The app needs a link or two for new cruisers. 

Maps maps maps but interactive maps!!

Maps so you can mark where to go and have it give you the quickest route step by step, like Google maps. 

If areas are down, have the app show that, like the self serve beer, and sent working but still showed as an option. | We just got off the Celebration and the app worked GREAT all week!! The 1 thing I think we should be able to do is schedule your own time for your time dining. We never really had to wait more then 10 mins but we had others in our party which made coordinating a little difficult. BUT ITS WAY better system then Royal Caribbean. | This app was great for my cruise because I was always able to see what was going on around the ship. I was also able to always for to the chat and there was no lag on the chat or app in general. | App worked good but it wouldn’t stay connected to the Wi-if. Each time we had to reconnect it manually (even though I had selected auto join. Not such an issue except when you purchase the Chat plan we’d have to constantly check to reconnect to see if family had sent a chat message or not. Often times it could be hours before they saw the message. | The app works great but the free WiFi needed to use Chat was constantly disconnecting. Became very frustrating. | If you just included internet with each passenger because I’d be more likely to rebook with you than a ship charging each person like you do now. Hotels include internet and it just comes with the room and Carnival calls itself a hotel on the water. So… include internet please. | Overall it was good. I would recommend to add the ship’s current position on the map like the map channel on the TV’s. I really enjoy that channel and while out and about on the ship would be nice to see on the app. | I love how I can find every event happening at the tip of my fingers! There are some times where the app lags when it comes to reservations but it’s not too bad. I attended a bunch of events because of this app and I’m really happy about that!! | Download the hub. It works to keep your family and friends connected on the ship.
We had a blast! | The app is great when the WiFi is working but it only worked about 25% of the time. Makes it difficult to book a dining room table or see activities. | Chat wasn’t good
Had a group of about 20 in a group 
Messages would get to each other maybe 2-6 hours later… not much help | I it worked perfectly. Keep me very informed. It saved me time from going to guest services and I like that I kept up with my incremental so I won’t over spend. It was very useful. | The app is nice to have if the WiFi works. Sent several messages that my group never received. | We just disembarked from a 6 day on Vista yesterday. The app worked perfectly for all things scheduling and keeping you informed as to what was going on throughout the day and what times each food or drink place was open, as well as viewing menus for the different food places. However, the in-app messaging feature that you pay $5 each for in order to keep up with people in your party was severely lacking. Some messages would never actually get sent even though it shows as if they did on the senders side, the receiver never got them. And the times for the messages were all out of whack. It would be 3pm and tell you the person sent it at 8pm, or 7am. There was no rhyme or reason to the times so you never knew if the message you were seeing was real time or not. Also, the notifications feature, at 10:30am you would get a notification saying the casino is now open, but the notification was time stamped for like 6:08am. Just some bugs to work out I’m sure, but overall for scheduling and not having to rely on the paper copy of events going on, it was helpful. | It is a great idea that was handy to have, but didn’t always work. Definitely worth the $5 for on board messaging, but needs to be more reliable.  Great for checking schedule of events and dining hours. | This app is great while on the ship. Helped so much to be able to see what was happening & you can go days ahead to check out what is going. Helped with planning. Also great to check your account summary.

It was fun at first and quickly lost interest. Saw an ad just now where I could have heard the two people swearing at eachother through the terrible music playing. Kind of a different approach I suppose. But not good enough to get me to start playing again. | Game was fun at first. And I guess it’s still fun when they have side goals that earn extra energy fast or the treasure boxes that spit out items you need. The frustrating part, once you get further into the game, (I’m at level 68 and have not spent a cent), is you have generators that spit out multiple categories of items. And it always seems that when your looking to get a specific item it produces that category of items significantly less than it would if you weren’t looking for that item, eating up your energy and making it impossible to meet your goal and move on. For example: there’s now a fishing rod generator. It spits out different levels of A. Fish B. Oysters or C. Shrimp…the customers always seem to want a shrimp or oyster item and it RARELY produces those. So you spend hundreds of power bolts, literally, just to start getting close to producing what the customer wants and there’s no way to force it/pick which items you want it to produce. Extremely frustrating to not fulfill orders for days upon days just to continuously have your board fill up with useless items that you can’t gain anything from. Another point is everything is paid for in rubies. Which are very hard to come across. So the ability to use these effectively is nonexistent. I’m sitting here with 73k + in coins and I can’t do anything because I only have 11 rubies. Ridiculous. 

Make money more useful and create a way to dictate what the generators produce or at least a way to increase the odds of getting the pieces you need! | I started playing the game to play the tiles.  Then when I saw that I had to do all this other stuff before I can play the tiles, I didn’t like it at first.  All of a sudden the tiles game part ended. By this time I start liking the game a little bit. But now, get to the point where I can’t, I can’t clear my board. My board is getting full and is getting frustrated that they don’t give me the pieces that I need when I click on the stuff to get the pieces that I need to clear orders. Then you all added additional items like cupcakes and all that stuff you know is getting is getting to the point where I can’t clear nothing and my board is getting full faster and then the games allow me the right pieces to fill orders. But before I can complete a new game that started it expires before I can ever clear it. It’s not getting to be un-fun. | The ads for this game are nothing like the actual game. | Why advertise a totally different game that what the actual game is???? False advertisement!!!!!! | Complex but with lots of help. | I love it so very much | اجمل لعبة | Great game | Addictingly good | I love the game. Me and my ex used to play all the time | What is it with the advertisement for this game that domestic violence is suddenly OK the woman walks in on the mend cheating, and the man slaps her in the face kicks her dog, and then they both laugh at her

This game is supposed to be for ages 4+… Is this what we’re trying to teach our children is OK? To be disrespectful to women to put a woman and a child out in the cold even in a cartoon impact somebody’s life do I have an advertisement like that? I can’t believe nobody has said anything and this is not been taken down because this is not the only game that does it.

I don’t even play this game anymore because of those ads.  I don’t know who is at the helm for PR or advertising…. But this misogynistic garbage needs to be addressed. | I have been obsessed with this game the last few days! They push the in game purchases HARD, but still fun. | I am enjoying this game | This game could be better if it was advertised correctly I got the game thinking it was more so the tile aspect part of the game turns out it’s only got 20 levels then no more after that…. Overall very disappointing. | Yah | Love the graphics and the storyline but whenever we run out of energy it runs out so fast. I personally think that there should be an ad to get at least 100 gems so we can refill the energy | I got this game because i see many people with the tiles and wanted to play that. But i can't find it anywhere? | This is a pretty decent game. Kind of boring though. I will admit I came to play this game to play the 2 player mahjong game but this game doesn’t even have it so I’m not sure why it has a picture of it in the app overview picture thing. I’m not sure why people on TikTok are advertising this game for the sole purpose of the mahjong game when it’s not even on here. All in all this game gets kind of tedious and I think adding the mahjong game so people aren’t baited and have something else to do in the game would help. | Fun and enjoyable! | ive downloaded a BUNCH of merging games with the same concept and gameplay, but genuinely this is my favorite. i play it every day, there is always new stuff and its very easy to progress in the game. a lot of other merging games take ages to progress in. 10/10, addicting lol | It’s 5 energy using items at a time. Not hard. 5. Get rid of old stuff after 5. | I LOVE this game a lot and have spent so much money because it’s genuinely an addiction BUT I’ve been noticing how the further you get on and level up, the more unreasonable difficult it gets. I understand because you level up, it has to be a diff setting but why do we not get an upgrade on how much energy we have? I’m on the medkit part and it takes all 100 of the energy to gather items for whatever is needed and it doesn’t even complete the order list. Can we get more energy as we level up? Like it stays at 100 even though the orders gets more difficult so it takes even days to complete orders. | Love the game and it’s so addictive | Super addicted | It’s addictive! | This game is actually really fun. I would recommend. | Yay | This game is for the quick minded people who has a big purse and quick hands | Great game that doesn’t require purchasing | Super fun | I’ve played many merge games and this one by far is my favorite! The only thing is, and by no means am I mad, as I’ve had no issues with my purchases, but just searching for help. I’ve made many purchases and the purchase I made 2 nights ago for the VIP cliff side challenge, was made at 17 creating a bunch of things to claim. I didn’t want to claim all at once as it was late and didn’t want to play much more, so figured I’d save them. Welp I came back to them for the 2nd time today went to claim the most recent one, I got that one, but the rest disappeared… I figured they were in my dump on the board slot on the merge screen & they were just gone. I’m not sure exactly how many I lost, but I’m going to guess 10? Can someone help please 🙁 | Cute time passer. | As a merging game enthusiast, I’ve played my fair share of titles, but this one has quickly become my favorite. The pacing is just right, and the gradual introduction of new elements keeps me engaged without overwhelming me. Ah, the Greek islands! The game captures their essence perfectly. Kudos to the developers for creating such a gem! | I enjoyed the game at first, not so much now. 
I dislike the fact that you have to wait a millennium just for “energy”. The app strategizes the player to buy items in order to continue the game. | They charge $7.99 for cliff side vip ticket. So you get 1.5X the xp to unlock the rewards. Which would be cool if the xp needed stayed the same it doesn’t they up the xp needed to unlock rewards so your paying  7.99 for absolutely nothing… no better rewards and it takes the same amount of time to unlock them…. Don’t waste your money…. Definitely scamming people out here! | Enjoy | I enjoy this game but it is becoming more and more frustrating when there are things that you need to complete but the ratio of how often you get that versus the other items from that produces is ridiculous. For example the boutique trolley and getting the envelopes. The frustration for these types of items is more than the enjoyment of the game now. | This keeps me occupied all day and I get mad when I run out of energy but I get it back so fast and I don’t have to spend any money either. | Very slow & boring. Very mediocre prizes unless you pay & even then it’s still closer to mediocre. Story line is a snore fest you will skip through it (as you should). The graphics are truly the best thing about the game. | USUALLY most games get boring or are different than the adds this is exactly the ad and better, very enjoyable the merge is my favorite thing to play with | It is so fun definitely a 5 star review | I wanted to play the game that was in the first picture and it never happened 🥲 | Loving this game and so far no glitches! | Love this game.  Bought the real tiles to play with family as well.  Relaxing, not stressful.  Beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay. | I like to play this game when I’m waiting in a long line. | okay, so i love this game but i want to have an account on my iPad and my iPhone at the  same time,however,when i try to do the transfer it just creates another account. so if you guys could fix this that’d be great! | I have a iPhone and I don’t have the tile game, the only thing it gives me is a paint the side walk and it won’t even do that. I love the game but I downloaded it to play the tile game that it showed, and they show on tik tok. | I’m only just beginning to play but I enjoy the story and the levels so far. We shall see as I

I invested heaps of time in creating smart and fun community courses in Latin, chiefly because I needed to improve, but also because it filled a need among other users. To me those were golden years, and my proficiency grew by leaps and bounda. Then I learned, yeaterday, that the app no longer gives access to your own courses. Instead you'll have to log in to a website from a browser. What was the reason to suddenly deprive users of their convenience as they spend hours and hours every day trying to learn new languages. Memrise must want them to not learn, and not be creative about making new courses, What an incredibly hostile move. It didn't ever occur to them to create a new app that could do what the regular app used to do. I can only imagine that Memrise is under new management, and run by people who have no interest in language learning, but only seek to monetize what's already there. It's over. They killed it | I’ve been using the app for years because of seamless community course integration with my university and private study materials. It was the BEST solution on the market for this—not even close.

Now you remove this functionality because of myopic short-run profit motivation around direct control of content rather than allowing for a crafted UX and pedagogical proliferation. I hope whatever fresh biz dev consultant who made this decision either gets fired, has their MBA revoked, or the app suffers up to the point at which you realize how atrocious this decision is. Very sad to have to find a new app after learning so much on this one. Guess a good thing cannot last forever. | Without the community courses, and with the terrible new upgrade, this app isn’t worth it any more. I’m sad to break my almost 500 day streak I had going in 7 different Korean courses.

To hear we won’t even be able to access them is gutting. | I have been using this app for many many years, more than I can remember. It was an amazing tool for learning and memorizing facts and vocabulary. The recent change to in house content only has destroyed the app for me. 90% of the content I use is community created and now that has all been removed to force in house content on me. The in house content does not cover my needs. So disappointing. | No more community flash cards so custom sets are a thing of the past. Other apps do it better in every way now. | Community courses are the only thing that makes memories worthwhile. Deleting the app now that I can no longer access them here. | This app has changed so much since I used it a few years ago. It used to have so many more options and features and I learned so much from it. I miss the community created courses and the old interface. Now you have to pay a (huge) subscription fee to get more features- and they’re not even the features that made this app the best. there’s really not much you can do with this app anymore if you can’t afford it, and even if you can, you’re getting a degraded version of what this app used to be. 
I’m seeing tons of other reviews saying these same things- developers, please listen to your users. | This version of Memrise makes me want to go back to the original. It keeps pushing me to chat with Chat GTP especially when I don’t have time. That is fantastic chat GTP is around to speak with but it is keeping me away from learning words and phrases that I need. Plus, it seems really lazy to include Chat GTP and call that a feature. I’m not really interested in yet another opportunity to speak with Chat GTP. Maybe there is a way to connect us with other individuals that are learning Spanish instead? I would find that incredibly more useful | I’ve used this app for nearly 10 years. Someone who knows and uses multiple languages daily for my career, this app was invaluable for maintaining and expanding the specific knowledge I needed. I could tailor lists to my specific needs and build them to reinforce topics I was weak in. I could just open the app and study a little each day. But now that you removed my vocabulary lists from the app, there’s no reason to keep it. | Please bring back the old interface or something like it. It’s no longer clear where one is in the progression of lessons for a given level. I really liked the old interface where each level was broken into a set of lessons, which contained some number of vocabulary words or phrases. Many language apps have copied the DuoLingo interface for a reason—it’s very motivating to see that one is moving along a lesson track. Where are the levels? | Super useful! | Got the lifetime subscription of Memrise a month before the most recent update. Now I’m stuck going to a website and rarely works to finish my community courses. Courses that I only have access to until the END OF YEAR?! The app is useless now and so does my “lifetime” subscription as well. | Помогает сильно по языку | One of the great things about Memrise for the 5 years I’ve been a paid subscriber is how community members can create their own courses on the platform. Well, Memrise has slowly eroded this feature, and as of this month (April 2024), they’re officially killing it off. Now it’s “use our predictable AI-infused courses or get lost.” Message received. Goodbye, Memrise. | Freeze on community course moved page. I am not able to navigate further on this all. Please suggest if this all is abandoned or blocked | I no longer have a reason to use Memrise. I moved to Armenia and can now no longer access the Armenian courses on the app due to the move. Now I need to go to a website that leads to a “bad gateway” to access the courses that have moved. In layman’s terms… I don’t have access to anything let alone the courses I used to study. A very genius idea on Memrise’s part 🙄 what a foolish decision. | Loving this app so far! I cannot wait until the ChatBot for Icelandic is available 💖 þakka þér fyrir! | The new update, which removed community courses, has created a great sense of disappointment. Memrise courses themselves are NOT GOOD or informative. Everyone had created their own courses to better teach themselves and their own lessons. Memrise had ultimately removed that feature, forcing millions of users to ONLY USE their courses. Deleted the app. Will not be using it again. Flop app | Getting stuff correct feels good. Also, at least for italian, the videos are funny and less corporate than other apps. | I need a refund bro! I didn’t want to pay for any apps | Community courses were the feature that truly set apart this app from others. Their removal killed the value of the app. | For some reason community courses have been removed | The new update removed offline learning and grammar exercises. It’s buggier as well. Somehow I tripped into a mode where the app endlessly suggested I watch videos. | I bought a lifetime membership, only to have them replace the original app with some weird, half-baked, AI disaster. Stay far away | This app is steadily going downhill.  I used to love it. I’m regretting buying the lifetime membership. Now it’s just the same as all the other generic language apps anymore | Used to be my favorite language learning app until they took away community courses. Very disappointing they took away such a useful and unique feature. I will not start using their official courses. | I am frustrated that Explore Mode does not work. After deleting and re-installing the app on my iPad, it no longer shows up in the list of apps requesting camera access. If the app does not show up in Settings requesting camera access, I can’t grant it. I’ve deleted and re-installed twice. This app has no support if the general FAQs don’t resolve your issue.  

Some of the French speakers are totally unintelligible, literally leaving 2 or 3 words out in a phrase or combing them into a mumbled blur.  I would have just as much trouble understanding my native English if pronounced so poorly.

To be fair, there are some features I like, particularly the ability to practice/review lessons you’ve already covered.

If I had it to do over, I would not have purchased lifetime access. | Only look at recent reviews. In 2024, the app was replaced with an unrelated product. | Completely getting rid of access to community courses on the main app is absolutely ridiculous and heartbreaking. We as a community spent so much time and energy creating our own courses and to have them completely wiped away and just put on the web app like that is supposed to help is maddening. So please if you have a heart or a soul please put community courses back on the app. We as users will protest this decision until it is reversed. | I really enjoy the interactive Memrise language app that include practice conversation, videos, and lots of helpful repetition | Their removal of the community courses from the app removed the entire reason I paid for a lifetime membership. The app is totally useless to me now. | My recommendation is to use Duolingo for the beginner lessons and once you get those down. Use this app Memrise to expand on your learning with the ""I'm a Beginner (knows some words)"" setting. The native speakers really help in getting you to speak naturally. | I am learning Russian, German, and Italian and this app helps a lot reviewing words I learn while watching shows and on Duolingo and Memrise also teaches me new vocabulary that I hadn’t learned yet on Duolingo and this app has very useful vocabulary that is the most important for travel such as “how are you” and other greetings like that. It also has videos of real native speakers saying the words and also Memrise has an ai chat that involve real life situations like getting coffee and asking for directions, and other things that will happen often. Over all this app is very helpful and can get you to a B1 or B2 level of the language that you are learning. Just as something that you can use along with this app is Duolingo and just plain old google translate to find out important phrases specific to your needs. | the reason that I downloaded the app was so that I could learn LATIN for SCHOOL. But now, it’s worthless. The app was great. You could just open it and then learn. BUT THE WEBSITE you open it, put in your passcodes and everything AND THEN you can learn. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put them back. I know A TON of ppl feel this way. My respect for the app just went WAYYYY down 😞😔😭 | Seriously what happened to this app? I used to love using it now I’m probably going to delete it from my phone. It keeps forcing me to talk to a chatbot which I hate doing in real life much less for fun. They used to do videos of locals around the city and now it’s just the same 2 people in their homes. Pretty sad to see. | No More Community Courses in App; WebApp is not visually user friendly on phone due to limited screen space | I loved this app until their recent changes to remove the community courses. Now, it’s basically useless to me. | Used to be a great app but with the removal of community courses and the introduction of unreliable AI to the app, Memrise has become nearly useless. Total shame. | Pros: seeing and hearing actual Italians speak to you
Cons:1) Videos of conversations is helpful but too much repetition
               of the same video 
          2)The concept of using AI to learn a language is great but it
              only works with typing on my iPad (audio function not 
              working).
          3)Tried to contact customer service about my Membot 
             issue but there is NONE.
Due to these issues I will not renew my subscription unless they make improvements to the App. | Great app for learning. I have been using it to learn Japanese for a while now and for the most part I like it, but for the love of god, stop recommending the chatbot after every lesson and review! | So I’ve used this for about one month and I’m learning Japanese,Korean,Chinese, and German. I Always go to nail salon’s but they mostly speak Vietnamese and the last time I went there I decided to learn Vietnamese,there’s no Vietnamese. This is the only app I trust with languages if you put Vietnamese on here (MemRise) I would be so happy! (Also could you add Thai please) | Expect to receive three emails a day and pop-ups in between each action in the app asking you to buy the (expensive) pro version. I understand needing to make money but I have to find the app useful before I decide to pay for it.

Most of the trainings feel pretty useless. It’s easy to pass all the quizzes since the questions only reference material referenced in that session, and the other multiple choice options are words that haven’t been covered often at all. 

Most of the training is based on phrases which don’t really get into the etymology of the words, or even the meaning of individual words, so you’re just relying on pure memorization.

Not much better than duolingo | I love this app!it helps me learn and memorize new words, and it a lot better then the most apps I have used! | I am so frustrated. I was billed $105.99 as per the Apple Store receipt. I had subscribed to the lifetime plan which was advertised as $99.99. 

It took me a long time just to find this and I can’t seem to communicate directly with Memrise. I have the same issue with duolingo. | I can barely spell in English. Why would i be able to spell a term i just learned in a language I don’t know with sentence structures I don’t understand yet. | This app was phenomenal last year! The interface was intuitive and easy to understand and cleanly displayed all the needed information. It even displayed a “total words learned” count at the top to encourage you to keep learning!

Unfortunately a lot has changed and the interface has been simplified considerably and even removed some beloved features. You also have to click extra boxes to move around or even stay on the same section to keep studying.

Despite the unfortunately changes there are still parts of the app that are amazing. I love the videos of people speaking the vocab, and not just one speaker! They shuffle through several people with slightly different accents to help you understand in the real world. The ability to select your own topics is very freeing, and I love the chat bot discussions or challenges!

So no longer a five star app, but I still recommend giving it a go 🙃 | I’ve been a longtime subscriber to Memrise but the recent decision to remove “Community Courses” from the app has left me disappointed and cancelling my subscription as well as finding a new language learning app home.

Could have gotten 3 nights free. No for one night had to pay $500. Only company that I have points with that took them away. | I am able to log in through the website version, but it is not letting me log in through the app. | I needed to modify an existing reservation by 1 day. Hotel app wouldn’t allow the modification, and after wasting time calling customer service who was also no help,  I was able to book a completely separate reservation myself and cancel the old one. Hyatt needs to join the rest of the world and have a better app to service customers. | I am unable to log in to this app. The sign in works on the Hyatt web site but not for the app. And this is the 2nd Hyatt I’ve been to where it says streaming is easy but I cannot cast to the TV. It says it cannot connect even though I am on the Hyatt WiFi. | Very user friendly | It's a great app except for when you search for rooms using points. When you do that, it shows you point values for rooms at hotels where there is NO availability for the dates you searched. You have to click on each hotel to see if there is actually any availability. This needs to be fixed ASAP. What good is the search if you show me 20 hotels that done have availability and I have to click on each to see that?  I have asked several times for this to be fixed to no avail. It shouldn't be that hard. 

Only 2 stars until this is fixed. | Wants me to update to their latest app but my IPhone will not accept that operating system.  App is totally useless unless you are using a new phone.  I stay at hotels weekly.   Sure am glad that Marriott BonBoy, IHG and Hilton aren’t as foolish as these guys! | I always stay here when in town. Always clean, pleasant, and great staff and breakfast! Mongo | I was excited to try digital keys in the Hyatt app and followed all instructions to provision. The app reported “we’re preparing your digital key!” for the duration of my 2.5 day stay, but never activated. | A real struggle for fields to open up and not sure why on a signed in app I need to put in name address etc | Quickly make a reservation and have all your info quickly with a push of a button. | Having a problem with the app automatically closing when I try to use the chat feature. Also had a lot of problems trying to reset my password with the request going through. Tried it over 20 times. | Dev & QA team - search/filter functionality needs a heavy dose of QA. When you filter for amenities, the filter is not working correctly. Use case: explore hotels & resorts -> filter -> amenities -> resort property -> apply -> select United States. There are 66 properties. Select any state. The filter disappears and app displays all properties. You need to re-filter again. | Easy and convenient. FB messenger for Globalist is fantastic | The Hyatt has very clean rooms with comfortable beds. Their staff is welcoming and very helpful. Outstanding customer service which is why I only try to stay at the Hyatt. | Hyatt updated app to not work with anything but latest IOS.  So can’t book hotel using app.  When visiting website and after logging in.  When I go to select book free night award the website says error page not found and freezes.   So Hyatt has effectively locked out their customers from booking unless they buy a new iPhone.  Useless | I need time to give this review 
Worth seeing at a later date 
Still on a travel thankyou ALL 
ESPECIALLY THE SERVICE WITH A SMILE THAT'S you AMBER!! | Not sure why this app and your profile doesn’t connect to the systems used at the Hyatt resort properties. Very annoying. Hilton and Marriott don’t have this issue. | 업데이트를 해야 사용할 수 있다고 나오는데, 업데이트 버튼을 찾을 수 없어서 Apps을 사용하지 못합니다. | After logging in to my account on the app and after attempting to book my stay through it, by first entering its hotel location and all, it wouldn’t let me do it; instead, just showing me the “We’re sorry, please try it again later” error message. To the app developer or whoever’s in charge of the app, please fix it. | Digital Key doesn’t work. Don’t trust / use it. | Love this easy to use  app. Easy to book when using points. The map view is fantastic and helps find the perfect location you need! | My brand explorer can’t display correctly on the APP. Even I tried reinstalling the APP and re log in it did not help. | The Hyatt phone app grays out (blocks) the credit CVC code box. It won’t let you go there to enter the required information. Then it blocks the form of payment because you didn’t enter the CVC code that it won’t allow you to enter. So you have to call to make a reservation even though you’re a Hyatt member. Reservations should be very simple. This app is why I avoid Hyatt as much as possible in favor of the other major brands that have workable apps. | We have always enjoyed staying at the Hyatt! The service is above and beyond, the rooms are clean & comfortable. The food has always been good! | This app refuses to run on my iPhone 7 unless I update to the latest app version — which is not supported on the iPhone 7. The response from the “Developer” states that this app is compatible with IOS 13 and higher. That is obviously not true, as I have IOS 15, and it won’t update or run on that version. Neither is it a “Service Provider” issue as they said. My only options are to spend $1000 or whatever the cost is for a new phone these days, or visit the Hyatt web site from my computer, which defeats the purpose of having a mobile web app. | The digital key is not working even though I have it Bluetooth enabled.  I’ve requested a digital key three times now having it say it will notify me but nothing.  Also doesn’t give you a really good breakdown of your bill.  An it needs to be more upfront about charges like parking. | I just downloaded the app and set up an account. I can log into my account on my computer, but not on my phone.  Worthless. | Funny how everyone is complaining about the same thing, and the response from developers is “contact us”….how about you just fix the f’n problem! | I have reset my password after being locked out, I have contact support and they say it’s not locked, I cannot access my account at all through the app. I was able to login on an internet browser on my desktop but the app is garbage. Hopefully they can fix it since I travel a lot; it’s super inconvenient and forces me to use other hotel chains. | My iPad is older and I have updated to software version 15.8.1
World do Hyatt requires a 16.0 version or later. I am now locked out of using a mobil Hyatt app. No other option available unless I switch to another hotel brand. | App is no longer working and will not update.  Tried deleting and reinstalling but did not fix it. | This is the only major hotel chair site I have found where I can easily make an ADA room reservation.  Thank you Hyatt for making life easier for the differently physically able. | It was working fine for awhile, then all of a sudden stopped showing me updates I made on my reservations, so as Hyatt suggested I deleted and reinstalled the app, but now all my reservations are gone.  Have tried reinstalling and logging out multiple times but didn’t work, it’s been a week and still no fix | I stay here frequently and have never had a bad stay. Great location. Great staff. Would recommend to anyone looking to enjoy Boston. | Hyatt is being somewhat deceptive in making reservations - in that it does not make it easy to determine IF a reservation is NON-REFUNDABLE  until you reach last screen of reservation before hitting the SUBMIT button!!  They should CLEARLY AND BOLDLY list “NOT REFUNDABLE” in the rate category page selection options- WHICH THEY CURRENTLY DO NOT DO !!! | We attempted to book a room, put the information in and hit submit - the app spun and spun. When it finally refreshed- we were charged $115 more for the same room.  Not a great experience, hopefully the hotel experience is better. | App says I need update. When I click on update it takes me to appstore. when I try to download it just goes back to update. What gives? around and around. HELP Please. | Amazing service overall | Shame | Like everyone that has reported this issue. Can’t believe this was missed and still not corrected one week later. | The app should have more functionality. For example, you can’t filter for things that are important like a kitchen or view. Marriott’s app does a much better job being user friendly. | The app is fine, but it needs to give the total price of a room,including taxes and fees.  You need to click “book a room” to see the actual price. | I can’t create an account on the app.  And once I created an account I couldn’t use the app to login.  Buggy | The title says it all. No problem on my laptop. 

When it is working, no complaints, but as it stands right now, the app is useless for accessing my account. | App no longer lets me sign in after most recent update. Just keeps saying “authentication error” | App was great when it used to work. With the new update, I’m not able to sign in even though I can sign into my account on the web. Please fix. | I can’t choose child age easily, have to click multiple times.
App hangs in the middle.
Can’t book with free reward night awards. I had to call customer service every time.
Couldn’t enter CVC number for credit card. | I can sign in just fine on my computer but I’ve yet to be able to log in with the app. It keeps saying authentication error something went wrong. I already checked my username name password and it’s correct.

Save on city rides","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/indrive-save-on-city-rides/id780125801?uo=4","inDrive, formerly known as inDriver, is a revolutionary ride-share application that boasts a presence in over 600 cities across 48 countries. Best of all, it’s completely free to use!

We're a new kind of rideshare app. We started up from scratch in 2013, and since then we've grown like crazy all around the world.
And now we're bringing our game-changing rides to the USA!

It’s an excellent taxi alternative for your trip. You can either find a ride or offer your own driving services through the app, making it super convenient and flexible. inDrive is a great ride-sharing option for rides in Miami. 

MORE CONTROL
Set the price you're happy to pay for rides and choose the driver you want to take you

FAIR PRICES
Our rides are cheaper because we don't charge drivers big fees

SAFETY FIRST
Vetted drivers, in-app safety features and a dedicated 24/7 support team

As a driver, you have the potential to earn more than a traditional cab driver using a standard transportation app. This is because you have the flexibility to create your own transport schedule and select which rides you wish to take.

Why Choose inDrive (a ride app or a driving app)

LOW SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR DRIVERS

We keep our service payments as low as we can, and they'll actually be 0% for six months from our launch.
We think it’s fairer this way. To us, you’re not just another driver who should simply take the rides we give you at the price we decide — no way, you're one of the team. 

QUICK AND EASY

Requesting an affordable ride is quick and easy with this ride-share app. Simply enter your starting point (A) and your destination (B), set your desired fare and select a driver to get started.

OFFER YOUR PRICE

We understand that finding a reliable and affordable ride can be a stressful experience. That’s why we want to offer you an alternative to traditional cab booking apps. With inDrive, you have the power to customize your rideshare experience. You can choose the driver you feel most comfortable with and set the price that works best for you. 

CHOOSE YOUR DRIVER

With inDrive, you have the power to select your driver from a list of those who have accepted your ride request. In addition, unlike other taxi booking apps, we offer you the freedom to choose based on factors such as price, car model, arrival time, rating, and the number of trips completed. This unique feature sets us apart as a preferred alternative to traditional cab apps.

STAY SAFE

Before accepting a ride, you can view the driver’s name, car model, license plate number, and the number of completed trips. This level of transparency is not standard in traditional taxi apps. Additionally, our app includes a “Share Your Ride” button, allowing you to share your trip details with family or friends. Our team is dedicated to developing new safety features to ensure a completely secure experience for both riders and drivers.

ADD EXTRA OPTIONS

By using this alternative taxi application, you have the option to include any specific requirements or additional information in the comments section, such as “traveling with my pet” or “carrying luggage.” The driver will be able to view this information on their driving app before deciding to accept your request.

JOIN AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY

If you own a car, you can make extra money with our driving app. Unlike other cab booking apps, inDrive lets you view the passenger’s destination and price before accepting the ride. If the price seems inadequate, inDrive offers the option to suggest an alternative price or decline the ride request without penalties. Moreover, this car booking app has low-to-no service rates, meaning you can make more money while driving with this taxi app alternative.

Whether you are looking for a new driver app for your trip or need a ride in Miami, you can get a unique rideshare experience with this great cabs & taxi alternative.

I am convinced they don’t screen their drivers. They are very rude and pull up with the worse and dirty cars you can actually imagine. Indrive!!!

Even after giving your location, they will not move. InDrive won’t let you cancel the ride either until after 5+ minutes, even when obvious the driver is not coming.

After weeks of emailing and struggling to get any assistance with a potentially lost item in a driver's car, this company asks again for the ride details, which I share openly.  They stated they would reach out to the driver about the LOST item and ask him to contact me.

The driver then reached out to me, only to share that the company had accused him of theft, saying that I logged a complaint. 

They threatened this poor man, who was an amazing driver, and I gave him a 5-star rating and a 25% tip.

The poor administration and communication of InDrive from the South African office, is one of the most pathetic service delivery I've ever experienced.

Do yourselves a favour and pay R30 - R60 more for another service and steer clear of these incompetents. | Buen servicio | Phuddi deyo 2 rides cancel kita aa ne pain ke aa loreya ne  id ban kar diti ae phuddi deyo shoreyo | My best application ever ..thank you so much | Why’d you remove enroute?

There is no way to accurately browse available reservations. You look for a reservation for two people at 8pm and all that comes up are restaurants that are fully booked. How is that helpful? The worst is if you are trying to browse availability at one restaurant over multiple days. Every time you check a new date the ENTIRE app refreshes. I cannot believe how user-miserable this app is. Can someone fix it, seriously horrible. Also Resy notify no longer works. | I can only assume Gary V isn’t paying attention anymore, because this app is trash now. | Can’t filter by price level…. | In last update, the ability to complete booking confirmation vanished. The booking process was never that intuitive for future resers (next day and beyond) but now.… it’s impossible. TBH, The only reason I use this app is because a favorite restaurant of ours has it as their only booking method. It truly needs a makeover, with more info for each restaurant, menus, take-our/deliveries, and including a separate page where active reservations can be managed. | Requested a “notify” availability. Was actually booked at the restaurant and then charged a cancellation fee. | Had been charged twice and a pretty substantial amount but really just redirected me to the restaurant who never picks up. | I put down a reservation for a large party one month in advance. But when I tried to put down a reservation for a bar for the group after dinner, instead of securing both reservations, the app just canceled my original reservation without clear warning. I contacted the customer service immediately but they just told me there’s nothing they can do to re-state the reservation. Now my party lost the reservation. This app is supposed to make reservations easy not difficult!! | The search functionality is what I find most frustrating. It doesn’t allow you to filter on neighborhoods or cuisines and still shows restaurants even if they aren’t available for the designated reservation time frame you are aiming for. It is the least user friendly out of the other restaurant booking apps that exist today | I have no idea who developed this app, but they should be ashamed of themselves. The app is aesthetically pleasing but the functionality is horrendous. For example, Resy texts an account verification code to finalize a reservation, only to say “Oops” the code isn’t correct. It’s the apps own code, how could it be incorrect?!? Simply useless app and a waste of time. Use OpenTable instead! | Annoying that sometimes it takes multiple tries for the notifications to set.  Also when a notify does come up half the time when I click on the notification it just opens the app without actually going to the reservation page. | It is impossible to use the new update. I find myself looking online instead of using the app. It doesn’t let me look for future reservation in a specific restaurant. Very disappointed | Downloaded. Tried signing up with mobile number 3 times. Code sent. Code entered. App says error. Then tried to setup account using Apple login. Go through a few screens, then app asks AGAIN for my apple email…I’m using hide my email…again failure. How can such companies stay in business? | Made a reservation for the wrong day by accident,  called and emailed right after. Rebooked for the correct day and was still charged $40. How do you stay in business treating people  this way? Definitely won’t be using this app again. | This app is truly terrible in regards to user interface. Crashes all the time and returns to home screen when searching. When reaching out to customer service they suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the app. With so many restaurants using it, this should not be happening | The app always glitches. A lot of the buttons aren’t responsive. Better off using desktop browser. | The only reason I use Resy is because of the restaurants selection but the app itself is a garbage. Map view is terrible. Default selection to your current location unnecessary. Selecting another date kicks you out from the restaurant page and gives you irrelevant search around you, even if you’re in your own list. Not to mention it crashes during peak times when people are trying to get a reservation. So much wrong with this app but this is all by design. They have no intention of improving the UX on purpose so it’s harder to get these reservations as demand is high for some of the best restaurants. All you can do is just keep trying and hope that you get lucky. Sadly, will keep using the app and even recommending but genuinely have an issue with it. | Can never properly select number of folks for a reservation no matter the update never works on apple 12! | Worthless, allows bots to grab all the prime tables.  What’s the point unless you want a mid week 5 pm table? | I wish there were a way to add a screenshot It’s all scrambled on the iPad app. The keyboard covers the dates etc. They run on top of each other I deleted it and downloaded again- no use | OpenTable is a million times better than Resy. All you do on Resy is click ""notify"" and it won't even notify you 😂 Open Table cares more about the user than the restaurant whereas Resy cares about the restaurant more than you! Terrible app | The app is useful for its purpose: to make reservations.

I wish there was a ""My reservations"" button on the map view. This would make navigation a lot faster if I don't need to view my profile first | Doesn’t let you change the number of guests in your party | The current format does not allow user to select dates beyond 5 display lines on the calendar.  So Easter Sunday is not a day to choose per current format as the app won’t display the 6th line and the next month doesn’t display the date either.  Overall the UI is poor and hard to manage but this error is egregious. | Unable to select March 31, 2024 or June 30, 2024 on Resy installed on iPad Pro. Those dates don’t show on screen | Resy has terminated my account twice without prior notice and specific explanation, only suggesting that their team (which in actuality is probably just an algorithm) thinks I’m a bot. This repeated random termination of my account has led to the loss of my reservations, ruining several dinner plans (including my birthday). Complete lack of customer service, which often sends automated emails instead of an actual human response. I live in a city where it’s essentially impossible to dine at restaurants without using the Resy platform. Beware. | Another app that is appalling to use. Enter time and date etc, click Search. Nothing happens. How hard can it be to design such a simple app? But instead of doing the job you want it for, the app focuses on sell, sell and SELL. What a disaster. | Wow Resy is perhaps the most frustrating app I have to engage with on a regular basis. It’s obviously built with restaurants and not customers in mind. You can’t book multiple things in one night so if you want to do cocktails for two hours before dinner at two separate places, forget it. I shouldn’t have the have my dad create a RESY account to get around the system, just so I can do dinner and drinks with him. The sign in process is so friction heavy, why do you need to send codes to verify my email and phone number every time (and yes this is more friction filled then standard two factor). Also it doesn’t allow autofill of simple things like your email, phone number, or password for secure password apps. It also doesn’t support public facing restaurant reviews. But somehow they’ve got charging you down to a very seamless process smh. This is an example of an app that is used because most of us have no choice. Too bad it has to feel so hard to enjoy a good dinner. | I’ll get a pop-up that one of the restaurants I’ve set a notification for is available, but when I click on the pop-up, it doesn’t take me to the reservation. This is new and never used to happen. I used to use the notification feature all the time. Frustrating. | I never write reviews - this might be my first one ever - but here it goes. I feel like the Resy app gets worse with every software update. It’s unfortunate because I love Resy as a concept and I continue to use it a lot reservations on a regular basis because of the restaurants on the platform, but it can truly be painful to use. | This is a solid app but there is some functionality missing that would really improve the user experience.

I’ll add additional notes over time.

My biggest frustration is that I can’t book two reservations for the same evening, even if they are a reasonable amount of time apart.  Dinner followed by another reservation right up the street and three hours later should be allowed. I understand not booking tables for the same 90 minutes time slot, but beyond that seems unnecessary. 

Next, I wish the restaurant names would display on the map when searching for available tables, its a small extra steps to click into the blue map dots, but cumulatively it does take a lot of extra time. 

It would also be great to be able to search for a range/window of times with available tables, instead of just one hour.

Lastly when setting up notify, it is important to be able to distinguish between indoor and outdoor tables, and presently, there is not that capability (at least on mobile).

Thanks for your dedication to a great user experience! | The search feature is all but useless as it just continuously jumps back to the home screen and doesn’t actually show you the reservation you’re looking for. Please for the love of god fix it. | I can’t even sign up because it won’t take my phone number | Unable to sign into app
Response status code unacceptable / 500 | On a way to a restaurant reservation made through Resy, while I was driving, I received a text message from Resy that asked me if I wanted Resy to silence my phone while I was dining.  Outrage by the implication that Resy would presume to deactivate my phone — after the only thing I did was given them my number — and because I was driving, I ignored it. While waiting to be seated I checked my phone and discovered that it had, in fact, been turned off.  I’m a physical on call, and also I have an important reason to keep the line open for an urgent family situation.  I’m outraged by the fact that Resy falsely believes that they hav a right to intrude in a unauthorized manner into my private cell phone.  I’m also outraged by the fact that Resy has not reached out to me to issue an apology.  What have we come to when a third party can legally enter an alter someone’s cell phone? I plan to escalate this in order to find if what Resy as done is legal. And, if it is I will work to change the law.  And, if it isn’t I will consider charges. Seriously, Resy. How Dare you? | Traveling for business, and I prefer reservations when brining business guests.    Looks nice, buggy acting and well…….  Got a long way to go before it feels dependable.   Might wanna take notes from the other apps. | Great idea for the app, But it could be so much easier. Like trying to cancel a reservation for instance. You absolutely have to have the app instead of being able to cancel it by email or on the restaurants website. Very inconvenient and you’re holding our reservation hostage until we download your app. star only because I can’t do less | Very laggy, slow to update, no innovation, poor customer service. This app does not deserve to he treated as a real complete app. Learn from Catch Table. | My contact information is REQUIRED for my viewing local area options?

Surely NOTHING COULD GO WRONG with my blindly trusting your protection of my privacy, right?

Oh, I FORGOT ABOUT YOUR BOLD PRIVACY GUARANTEE…

Crickets… | More and more restaurants are using Resy these days for reservations, and that’s great, but something really annoys me. I book reservations for my boss all the time, and need to put the reservation in his name, but it doesn’t have that functionality. I can’t log into a different account, because I need to use my cell phone, and I can’t create more than one account. 

Actually, Resy has very little functionality. It is nice that it’s simple, but being able to change diners is important to us Executive Assistants! Please help! | Tried booking restaurant multiple times with saved Amex card. It would freeze and I’ll have to force quit it. Really buggy overall. | Resy is very limited in the restaurants available to book reservations, and the restaurants listed are mostly limited to a small number of large cities. There are other restaurant booking apps that have many more restaurants available at numerous locations. Recommend other apps as Resy is very limited in it’s usefulness.

Had never heard of Resy until it was forced as the “new” partner for the Delta AMEX credit card (soon to be known as the “K-Mart Blue Light Special” of credit cards. | Login attempt #19 and it still doesn’t work. Somehow there is an account with my email….but it can’t find the account. So I can’t create an account because the email exists. Fine create brand new email, fake name and wow it now works. But I can only make a reservation for that day…not tomorrow like it shows on the web version. Idk if this is due to the new apple update or what, but wow is this app terrible in every way. Do not bother downloading or trying to use | I tried to book a reservation at a very hard to book restaurant. I did everything right, but after hitting their “Complete Purchase” button, I just got a hanging screen that said “reticulating splines“ for 15 minutes. by the time I was able to try again, the table was long gone. | Many restaurants don’t allow you to book a reservation until 3 weeks out at a certain time. This app will surely not work and/or crash if you try to book in advance during that time. | I feel like they made this app bad on purpose. Search is terrible. Keeps sending me out to Long Island.  Can’t change party size if it’s let’s over from the main page.  Truly not getting the developer attention it needs.  Maybe on purpose.  Can’t be this bad by mistake. | At some point resy overtook open table and became the main reservation app. But functionality wise I have no clue how they managed to do that. Their interface barely works, you can’t search for restaurants based on preferences. And more than half the time there’s some glitch where it won’t show me my current reservations. You can’t view people’s reviews or anything. The move is to research on Yelp or Google and then book on resy bc restaurants won’t let you book on anything else. As a product manager this app is truly a shame in both UI and functionality. Eng/product/design do better. | I tried to book at a popular restaurant that is always booked. Everyday at 10am, it opens new reservations on Resy. The app does not reflect the new available reservations fast enough. So I had to go to the website to try to book, but it was too late. | I have never had so much difficulty navigating a reservation app before.  Wish my favorite restaurant utilized OpenTable which I love! | This app is absolutely useless if you’re trying to snag an in-demand reservation at the release time. Developers have allowed bots to snap up every in-demand reservation faster than any human possibly could. Incredibly disappointed that Resy continues to allow this to happen. The app regularly crashes during popular release times and has a poor user interface to boot. Not sure why this has become the default app for customers and restaurants when the experience is so consistently poor. | Resy CS would not cancel the reservation the app automatically made me, for the wrong time, with a cancellation fee, when all I did was sign up for the waitlist to see if we could make it work. Resy CS also refused to close the account I created to make the reservation, since I had a pending reservation (which again, I did not create!). I wasted HOURS emailing the restaurant to cancel the reservation, emailing Resy CS, and was completely stymied by the entire experience. In the future I will skip the restaurant altogether if it requires a reservation through Resy. 4 hours I will never get back.",4.79971,202221,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/55/4e/87/554e8762-92de-0c6b-775d-547d5483800b/3fae6298-afd0-4118-b2ab-fb06470284dd_iPhone_Pro_-_en-US_-_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/a9/4d/25/a94d2542-7c14-f0d6-ed14-1118d33ebc5f/c7c55f3a-2a8a-4e49-bd6d-c16ef7fec9d1_iPhone_Pro_-_en-US_-_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/06/f2/27/06f227ed-86fb-701f-3331-bfa42928516a/ffe2b8b9-eeb1-4aff-b531-fef516f2f209_iPhone_Pro_-_en-US_-_02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/9c/e8/27/9ce8273c-c385-8ccf-355c-105fcd34d91c/2df8060c-5b5b-4e0a-9e1b-9c8056704cea_iPhone_Pro_-_en-US_-_03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/7b/aa/f9/7baaf976-06fb-126b-f1e0-0e3a747bd4fd/8f8a3fac-13eb-459f-9650-b19565d122bd_iPhone_Pro_-_en-US_-_04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/ba/34/ca/ba34cab1-642c-188f-943c-7a17f1503482/899ccfb3-8987-4e63-911f-3e759500544e_iPhone_Pro_-_en-US_-_05.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Apparently the only supported location now is some random video game room. You would think there would be at least one place to get a drink in the main airport of America’s largest city. | There are no gluten free dishes offered . Nor desserts. They could have even small frittatas. | I arrived at the Nassau airport to find out the lounge has been closed for 3 months for reservations. Why is this not on the app? | Despite activating my account via my credit card, the app won’t let me register via credit card. Admittedly could just use membership number but forgot card at home though specifically because I saw I could register supposedly through credit card. | I just received my Priority Pass select membership renewal card in the mail…so I decided to download the app.  The app seems half finished…it doesn’t even show my membership number when I log in…nothing on the phone for the lounges to scan?  “My details” shows nothing but my name….I already know that info!  So other than locating the handful of these overcrowded lounges around the world…what’s the purpose of this app? | Was the best in New Orleans | It’s sometimes difficult to navigate and difficult to update account info. Also system doesn’t allow access to multiple priority passes if a person has now than one card.  However, enjoy the lounge internationally. Domestic is a hit or moss. | I cannot reset my account… thoughts? | No way to update account with new priority pass card. App cant even find Nashville airport. | The credit cards tout the Priority Pass but we can rarely get into the actual lounges because they’re at “capacity.” | The Google Map hour and Priority Pass App hour is wrong for the Be Relax Spa in LAX international Terminal. The shop said they closed at 9PM. And the staff is really inpatient and annoyed to tell me the shop is closed. I understand it has been a long work day but it’s not the guest fault to arrive before 9PM and no one update any source of open hours. | Priority Pass is advertised as a key perk of the Capital One Venture X card. Restaurants are completely excluded on the PP membership that comes with Venture X. Basically worthless!! | The most horrible experience, except for the attendant at the entrance desk.  She was welcoming, unfortunately everything went south from that point on.  Coffee bitter and cold.  Food in the self serve area was scanty, salty and unpleasant.  We placed an order but couldn’t wait because it took too long. The first experience was good. I don’t know what happened!! The new coffee machine with the fancy touch screen needs to go back to the previous coffee making school. It’s HORRIBLE! | Had to create 3 accounts to make it finally work | One and a half hour wait list . It’s a useless as it could be. Very disappointing. | The app shows nearby lounges, which is great, but it doesn’t tell me how many visits I have done and how many I left before getting charged by my credit card company. This caused me to get charged for a visit which I thought was still free. Guess what? The lounge staff are also unable to tell me how many visits I have left. Unbelievable! What’s the point of having an app if you’re not going to give the user essential information regarding account usage? | Says it needs to download data but just gives the spinner of death. Can’t login. Can’t access anything. Yet I’ve got great internet as I’m writing this review so you can’t blame it on bad internet. | Every time I attempt to use a club it is either full or closed. I am here at Los Cabos Airport awaiting my flight that departs in 2 hours and the club is closed. By the time it opens at 9:00am I will be boarding my flight…!!! I will surely remember this when my membership is up for renewal. | Staff lovely. Food excellent! Homemade!
BUT very very small. Worse atmosphere than sitting in the terminal. Photos deceiving. | The number showing as my acct number is not correct. When I go into the edit section there is a message saying I need to update my payment details but I just received a new card in the mail last week.
It will not allow me to log on! | This app is a mess. I cannot update my account details. | Thank you | Checked in at Schiphol Airport the morning and I am unable to find the Priority Pass lounge. Have you designed the app intentionally so customers can’t find the lounge? | Received new card w new #
Deleted old
Now can’t download new card to apple wallet
???? | Wait list to get into lounge. 20-30 minutes.
Why bother joining this service if you can’t use it when you need it.
Unimpressive lounge. | Do not have the lounge in the Newark airport where I fly most of my travels | Unable to login with new info despite deleting app and reinstalling it…so frustrating | Please fix. When you said enter username or member # and I did using what you sent me from email and still didn’t work . Spent over 10min and tried over 6-7 times. No good. | When we tried to use the United Loung, which showed up on priority pass web page, we were told the pass is not accepted at that lounge. | Buenos Aires airport ( EZE ) won’t allow passengers into the area where the lounge is located until 3 hours prior to a flight.  Upon arrival, the lounge is nearly empty but the reception desk reports a three hour wait to enter. | The digital card doesn’t expire for another two years yet the app says my membership expired two months ago and will renew (two months ago), as if the date is in the future.  They have a very small number of maps for airports.  The info on the lounges tells you nothing about guest fees and how to make a reservation at the lounge.  One of the worst apps I’ve ever seen. | The website does not say what details are needed for the particular line unless you click it multiple times. I found this difficult to enroll and did not know which plan I was being enrolled to with the card. It was clear as mud. | How do I edit my address?  Edit buttons don’t work in app. | This application is completely worthless. Will only let you select American Express, which I do not have obviously. Talk about a real disappointment. | No clubs in the most popular airports, and more locations close than open. Perhaps if you fly out of one of the very few airports that still has clubs it makes sense, but a pass for everyone else. The app is fine | I a member of a few and have found Priority to be the best of all lounges including Admiral and United | And now won’t show up as app on fone. Its there but no widget.  Super irritating | Unable to use the priority pass as a Chase Sapphire member. What a waste of this benefit. | I’m disappointed.   I’m here sitting in some miserable gate seats for hours in miserable terminal 5 at ORD.  Swissport Lounge was “at capacity” but then the guys lists off airlines who’s passengers that do have access.   This is worthless.   This card represents the 2nd class leftovers like the dummies that you see waiting outside a night club because they are “at capacity” and aren’t on “the list”.  

I suppose it is a marketing thing to show the world that they can have access to all these lounges to sell it the product, just to get rejected and realize they’ve been duped.  

I’m going to write a review in every place that I can.  I’ve got 3 hours to kill before my flight and another 16 hour plane ride with WiFi after that.  

Good luck with your business model. | I I joined Capital One Venture X card which says that I can be a member of Priority Pass. It’s been over a month now, and Priority Pass says they don’t recognize my card number. I called Priority Pass. They told me to call my bank. I called my bank they told me to call priority pass. This appears to be an unresolved issue and I think it is a scam. Reporting it to Better Business Bureau.
Just received a response from Priority Pass to this complaint. They told me to reach out to Customer Service. My arms are sore from reaching out to their customer service as well as Capital One. Continue to be disappointed in this offer. Deborah Owens. | Attempted to visit this Lounge and while few persons were visible in it we were told that is was all booked and we could not enter.  About 18 people we waiting to enter this vast understaffed facility when we arrived.  

Jeffrey T Skeim
Clearwater, FL | The app used to be great. Now I can see my renewed priority pass card but have no ability to change the expiration date on the credit card attached to reflect the new date. It gives the option to edit but when selected does not allow you to make any changes just exit back out. Also, it does not seem to be showing lounge information for almost any airport and I know there are lounges in some I regularly use. It has become useless. | I was looking forward to setting up my account with the Priority Pass but I’ve struggled to even get the website to recognize my card number and two attempts to call the service number have resulted in calls being ended without being answered. Wish the experience were better, but it’s been absolutely disappointing | App or their website won’t let me change billing info. | So many website/app errors | None of the lounges were available because they weren’t giving Priority Pass access because there’s not enough tables. | Terrible app. Doesn’t work. | Great service, ugly new logo | Just tried to get in the lounge in lima, Peru, and was told my pass was not valid. | Priority Pass was involved in a data breach and now we cannot change our passwords through the app. The function simply doesn’t work",4.78924,318872,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/f6/be/60/f6be602a-ac38-46a3-8f3f-399b5db96a3b/tns.drhbzixg.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/44/41/69/444169c7-bbed-8a29-5a49-b02a79cc2e33/1200a2c2-f682-4a0e-8500-fe6872ff3ec0_PP_AppStore_Screenshot_4_iPhone__U00285.5_U0029EN.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/f3/6d/65/f36d65bf-8d76-3c94-751b-709260d0a1ce/tns.hpbcarex.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/f2/d5/8f/f2d58faa-05c4-e1d5-8229-75f39cdf4531/tns.bcewcsyo.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/39/50/a4/3950a4a3-6bea-4d9f-ffb9-591b116d10cd/tns.wijhwtgd.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/24/cd/45/24cd4531-37d0-4ad8-1f36-9167a92fb1d3/d990cca3-9dbe-4677-b1de-eead2178450c_AppStore_Screenshot_1_iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/f4/3d/80/f43d8093-62cc-c6bd-bf7b-08b060db80db/c41790ac-3583-4d40-8d66-45565a180850_AppStore_Screenshot_2_iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/be/ff/7a/beff7aea-dbaa-d776-e491-5ddd257f85a9/6672e0d7-9dcb-44f5-8f4d-b25b72885102_AppStore_Screenshot_3_iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/05/2b/44/052b448c-f23f-e746-a0e1-316f28368be7/2fef65f5-78bd-4db9-8978-d989d77debff_AppStore_Screenshot_4_iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/0b/41/cd/0b41cdce-39bd-b88b-d833-eaac064366b9/73d0b5a8-e4cb-49b0-941e-89817af43f88_AppStore_Screenshot_5_iPad.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I’d scoured Avis’ site prior to reserving a car, to ensure I brought ALL documentation *they* accepted for Debit card use (instead of a Credit card), and even PRINTED that list out (and them some) and brought it all with me. In fact, I’d cancelled a reservation with a different company, *because* Avis was seemingly both more affordable, AND openly listed the accepted documents for debit use on their site; I had no reason to believe otherwise. 

However, they failed to include anywhere that they are *credit based only*. Those 3 words would’ve save me literal days and money. They run a credit check on you *regardless* of documents or deposits, and will not take them in lieu of credit like other companies will (AND you won’t be able to book with the *other* company’s at the airport either, because while they do take your documents, and do not run a credit check, they have to be reserved already; no walk-ups allowed). And if booked online or through a 3rd party app/host, you’re doubly S.O.L., because they don’t run it until you’re at the counter of that city somewhere.

This company didn’t accept *any* of the documents they listed—not a single one, much less all the ones I brought—even with the printouts of THEIR site of what’s accepted. Yeah, they “take” Debit, but it’s only on a technicality, they run a credit check— that’s what they do, plain and simple—and THAT is what they should advertise front and center when listing what to bring for debit. That part on their site is misleading, and it could leave you stranded too if you’re still building your credit.

I figured something out, thankfully, not that I had much choice, but I won’t soon forget how mislead I felt, and how costly this failed booking ended up being on my family, financially and emotionally. Lesson learned; I’ll go with a different rental company, even if just on principle now. | Poor | Cars are typically unclean and unkept. I pay high prices for a car rental to get into a dirty car. Why? Why isn’t a car they cost you $180 to rent for 24 hours detailed and clean? there’s nowhere on the app to rate the condition of the vehicle. The last vehicle was wrecked. How do I know I’m getting a wrecked vehicle? Who wants that! does Avis even care about the quality of product and customer service they’re providing. | The app is decent but only displays obvious information and the only functional part is the make a new reservation tab which tells me the objective is not to make the rental experience fantastic for the customer but to just get you to make and pay for a reservation. Any app that cannot match for the most part, the capabilities of the web interface should just not exist especially if the company cannot be bothered to update and bring new features to it | I don’t know if it’s the app or the various Avis locations that is the problem. | Even with a reservation, the application surfaces an error whenever i am asked to select my car. And am forced to wait in line at the desk, which makes it pointless to be an avis member | I starting renting from Avis when I was on active duty because they were military friendly, but I continued after separating from the service due to their awesome rates, comfortable vehicles, and their support staff are second to none!!! | Great Service and was able to pick out of a nice selection of cars/trucks and quick service | Not able to store new reservations and every time I have to enter | Great app easy to use. Was able to confirm ,modify rental easily | Should be able to find your Avis number by entering your email. I guess I’m using another rental company. | I would like to Thank Avis for a smooth transaction. It began unsatisfactory, but the awesome customer service I received to resolve any issues was amazing and much appreciated.

Thanks again. | Love them customer service always goes beyond | Seldom works and many features never work. quite silly actually. | Simple and easy process to extend return. | The app won’t give me a receipt even though  it shows the rewards were issued | I reserved a car and after I use my points it came out to $134 and some change which I prepaid ..after my trip a checked my credit card to see if I was reimbursed for the hold and I see I was charged by Avis a full amount…I checked the app and the points weren’t applied I called them about this and they ask for email stating that points were used I told them I never received emails from them saying points were applied and this is my 3rd time doing so.. was told that I didn’t apply the points and therefore I can’t apply any points and refused to apply points since as they said rental is closed…I did my rental agreement just like I’ve done before and I questioned whether they had a computer glitch and both people I spoke with flatly said no…. I mentioned why would I reserve a car and not use my over 15,000 points…was told you just didn’t apply it …HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE..will not EVER tell anyone to use Avis…I Will you up these points and triple Check and then I’m Done | Tried to use app to return car and it kept saying refresh gps ! Usually I don’t have a problem | Last 2 times after leaving the lot - noticed fuel tank was not full only about 3/4.   My name was not on the board, no text notification, app said car was not ready.  Had to wait in line for about 20 mins to get the car.   Desk Agents were nice - they said they got really busy and were understaffed.  Felt bad for them - but National and Enterprise had cars and no lines - may be looking at moving my business. | Charging me a ridiculous amount to keep the car an extra 6 hours due to a family emergency. | Why even have an app if you’re not going to support it? After making my initial rental reservation, it wouldn’t let me log in or even look up my details with my reservation number. No matter what you do it tells you to call. I haven’t even picked up the car yet and I’m already disappointed. | Whenever I use this app over 30days it's very difficult, resetting password, edit credit card but you have to go all the way out or do a split payment. However, cc is not expired but the app says it is. | All of the supposed benefits of using the app (choose your car! Skip the line!) are nonsense. Error message, get in (long long long) line. Every time. | Is impossible! | This app is terrible.   It has all your info but then tells you that you are not logged in!   There is no obvious way to log out and re log in.  I'm about to change rental companies.  It's taking too long to make a reservation | I don’t want a $@&/ EV, stop pushing them on me. | I tried to use the Avis car rental app this morning and it did not work at all. I attempted to put in the location I wanted to rent from and got no results. Had to call a customer service representative to get the information I needed | Current vehicle is in bad condition.  Beside high mileage and damaged at some places; the car shakes and vibrates when driving on the highway. The assumption might be something simple such as tire balancing and/or wheel alignment.  Based on damages to all 4 tire rims.  It might be something worst and might be a hazard for the road altogether. 

In addition, vehicle was super dirty.  There were spillage of food n drinks left stain at the seat.  Carpet is vacuum though. | They don’t honor reservations, and their employees are incredibly rude. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere | This app is of little use if it doesn’t save entered reservations. | Work with Advis through Coporate relationship. Made it easy to book, pick up and adjust rental drop off on the fly. Very easy to use. | Love the way I can rent my car and walk straight to the rental and leave skip the lines and customer service is helpful when needed!!! And the app is so convenient!!!!!! | I’ve been renting from this Avis for awhile now, and the rental agent Michael has been phenomenal in his assistance to make sure I’m satisfied and that I receive the help I need to meet my needs. This is the place to rent from. Mike is just good people and he has made experience worth recommending to others. | Short of making a reservation or finding rental car, it never works. Can’t exit with pass, can’t return car when at lot. NEVER works. | Today makes the fifth time I reserved a car trough this app and wasn’t able to pickup a car on the pickup date.  Tampa (Dale Mabry) location is unreliable | Easy to use.  Clear details. | I love Avis as a whole but it seems the past few times I have rented in VA, my car has been dirty. In Houston, it was dirty and I had them wash it before I drove away. I did not have time to wait this time. It was really bad but I kept it anyway. | Your app is very confusing.  Does not know who I am and always forgets that I am a preferred customer.  Very frustrating | I make a reservation to get it get a truck you guys can’t even send me a notice saying that you don’t have no vehicles available for my reservation if you wait till after I landed at your airport and then tell me that there’s no cars available I will never ever deal with Avis ever again | Impossible to update my credit card nor my driving license | Always on spot. Avis exclusively for over 30 years | I was given a car that was damaged!!The customer service is very poor the representatives have a habit of hanging up on you and it’s very difficult to get them to credit you for miscellaneous charges that are not applicable I’ve made four calls to this company regarding incorrect charges. I should not have to fight for mistakes made, then they offer me two free rental days but I can’t use them because I don’t rent those type of cars. | The process to activate your account takes you in endless loops, continually tries to get you to create an account- which is verified. WTH?!? | No such thing as Preferred in SAV.
Been waiting 25 minutes for my car after completing the paperwork. 10 other people waiting as well. The counter just blows you off when you inquire when we may expect a car. | This app needs an immediate update.. my upcoming, current, and past rentals are never there.. For me to find my reward points I have to go to a summary just to find it..  Notifications doesn’t work either.. Avis should do better. | When I rented a car recently they automatically charged me for a full tank fill up and said this option was on my preferences (in the app).  I logged on and went into preferences and there’s no option for me to change the above.  Very frustrating, now I have to make sure that gas fill up charge is not on my bill when I pick up my rental. Help!!! | The app repeatedly gives me error messages at the end of the long process of making a reservation or creating an account. It’s awful. | After numerous tries over the years going with the cheapest, finally decided to pay more and go with AVIS where you have reliable service … and  friendly staff, for the most part.

And great service at airports. Cars are modern, clean and app is easy to use to change rental period / drop off location. | Making you wait for a new nonsense id verify",4.69641,275022,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/26/aa/59/26aa5972-dc4e-9bd8-a24a-ea58221d9ee8/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/0e/23/3f/0e233f68-0579-e870-3d81-911677508133/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/d9/d6/3b/d9d63bf1-d9aa-e95a-812d-0ef6e96a463b/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/a0/36/1d/a0361d87-72e2-5900-b40a-c80d4f795308/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/e5/1b/02/e51b026c-68e3-c02f-c59c-c6fa32605c28/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Yeah? Do it for the fungi folk! Much thanks in advance. | Watch out for the classic being billed even though you cancelled the subscription. Many apps with comparative features that have actual support that don’t do stupid billing tricks. | THEY SHARE YOUR EMAIL BIGTIME - Ive been tracking numerous 3rd party emails coming to the address i signed up with. i did not give the company the right to share my personal information. BEWARE | I’ve been a Gaia user for a few years. Over the last few months to a year it has been a pita. Lags, won’t load the map area or takes 5-7 business days to do so under WiFi, the display is cut off on the iPhone, address that do in fact exist, won’t populate when you search for them. Mind you, yes, my app is up to date and yes, the saved files are in constant need of being updated which gets done. I would switch to OnX BUT I don’t want to pay for 2 of them as I cross between 2 out of the 3 I need for my usage. I unfortunately have no choice but to keep this over OnX until someone changes 😫 | Utterly nonfunctional for any navigation. Crashes instantly. Used to work, disappointing to lose it. | Sure, the free version is adequate enough to track where you’ve been. But if you want the satellite view, you have to pay a minimum of $60 a year. You’re out of your mind for that kind of price. I miss track kit pro | One of the best cross platform apps that seemlessly updates to all your devices. Maps are detailed yet not cumbersome. Excellent user interface with easy route creation due to auto-snapping into known streets. Also very easy to share easy to export/import data and share tracks.  GAIA team takes consumer input and continues to improve the product and user experience. | This app was my sole navigational source during bikepacking the Baja Divide. 
1000+ miles not a single problem!!! 

Great app and thank you Gaia Team :D | CalTopo is way better! Gaia app just locks up. Not reliable at all! | No idea why people pay for this. Other apps don’t require you to login again and again (which would be impossible if you didn’t have cell coverage in the back country), and you also have to pay for downloadable maps, which is a free feature in other apps. | Totally new to off-road apps so I downloaded Gaia and OnX at the same time. Very different experiences. Touch anything in Gaia and you get blocked by an add to upgrade for $60. Kind of very limited use click bait kind of thing. I couldn’t try out anything without paying $60. How do I know if I even like the app?  Frustrating. | The only real difference is this feature. And it’s very important feature considering how most people will want to download at some point. Unfortunately you’re stuck with the new version as the old version is not available for purchase anymore. | Great features, I use all the time and a super good app | This app consistently underreports how much altitude gain I have on hikes.  On a recent hike it reported a roughly accurate gain of 530 ft. at the top of a ridge but as I started to descend the total reported altitude gain decreased to 414 ft. then remained constant all the way back to the trailhead.  The cumulative altitude gain/loss on the trail from the guide was 630 ft on this out and back trail so the app underreported by about 35%.  I otherwise love this app but it seems to always underreport altitude change. | Can’t create an account, can’t sign in. Messsge is unclear what I’m doing wrong. Outside screwed this app up. | I feared Gaia QC would go down with recent changes. And it did. Routes you work on for hours go missing, trails go missing unexpectedly even online mode then also comes back unexpectedly. Gaia can not be trusted anymore. | I can’t log in and there’s no customer service to talk to. There should be customer service if I’m paying for an app. | Hello. I am vocationally Oly a UX UA designer and I can’t figure this app out. I understand that if I know my the name of my hike or the address, and I can download the map it’s going to be fantastic. 

But all I want to do is find hikes that are near my area. I am new to the state. What hikes are around me? I thought this app could help. But I’ve now spent an hour and a half on YouTube trying to figure it out and I’m convinced that there must be another resource for this. Potentially printed book?

It would be an easy fix to include hike locations highlighted on the map (if you CAN do this, I can’t discover anyway on the interface, or in a video to do it). Or, enable to filter the “near me” search results to sort by distance to my location. You know where I am, because I turned on location settings for the app. All of the recommended near near me hikes don’t have any information about how far away they are. All I get is a list of “recommended” and I can click on each one, open it, zoom out the map and then be like “good grief that’s far!” I know that there are beautiful hikes around Seattle, but I don’t want to drive for 90+ minutes to get to a hike. I want to know what’s nearby. 

I already spent my 90+ minutes trying to figure out this app. If I do locate a hike, perhaps I’ll be back. | So many features, lots of great technical tools. I’ve been using Gaia for years and love it! | Doubled price without adding any useful new features. This was my go to trail app but I am done. | Really great app - very easy to use, especially if you’ve used a hiking GPS in the past.  You just have to start your track by hitting “record” and then click the Map button and zoom in.  Excellent! | The latest version brings single tap to build a route which is much better than before. But I need to make routes where I can add points to streets or paths that already are added to the route. Think of a route that goes to a peninsula and I then need to return the same path I came from. I can’t add points to the route that already has a path there.

EDIT: They fixed the route planning :) | It was such a good and dependable app. After update now it crashes everytime I open it. | Great app. | I love this program I have been using it for years now and with the price increase I would like to see some improvements. (Which is why I have a lower review, not the cost but the continuation of long term minor issues) 

1 the map layers show duplicated in the folder for map layers 
2 there are no controls to increase text size for map layers, there interactive as they adjust there size the closer you get but well using the app on mobile the text is not a reasonable size to read easily. 

If those two things get resolved this program is 5/5 top notch | Desktop and mobile don’t see each other. Whatever you upload on desktop doesn’t show on mobile and vice versa. Can’t upload pics to either. Waste of $$$ Update: even worse. Have been on with their “support” for almost a week. It’s like pulling teeth with no anesthesia - they know nothing and can’t fix anything. At least for a refund.

Another update: they have simply abandoned my issues. If you want to stay alive in the wilderness, don’t use this app! | I thought this app was great at first and I've been using it the last 7 months, but it was barely worth the price before, now it's not worth it at all. On several instances, we would be out on forest roads and trails and no matter which layers I'd select, the app wouldn't show the roads we were on or would show that they end. But then my wife would bring up google maps and, it would display an accurate depiction of the roads. And now on the new interface, you have to record before your pace is shown. I don't record most of my adventures,  but I like to use the app's display to see my pace. Also, the new interface is bulky. The old one was way more streamlined. Anyways, I've cancelled my subscription and will be looking at OnX and others. | Bumping your price by 50% is totally unacceptable to me. Gaia is one of the few apps I’ve been willing to pay a significant amount for, due to its functionality. That being said, $59.90/year is unacceptable. Looks like corporate mergers have destroyed another valuable thing. After years of using Gaia, I’m really sad to have to use something else, but it looks like that’s where we’re at. Bye. PS: developer responses like “write to our support team” in response to this sort of complaint, is telling. | I was trying to figure out why my pre-plotted hike gave me literally 2x more elevation gain than my recorded hike of the exact same route. I started moving the dots around and realized how inaccurate it is. In one flat area I moved the dot perhaps 50 feet down the road and my elevation changed 100 feet. Again this was in a flat area. The result is that using this app I l it really have no idea which of the many conflicting numbers it is spit to go out are accurate. I gave it two stars because at least it opens and the clock works. | A great app but I honestly feel a bit hurt that theyve made such a steep subscription price hike for their loyal customers. Going outside shouldn't cost an arm and a leg and neither should access to maps. Im out for now gaia. ✌🏽 | Great app on the iPhone but no labels show on Apple Watch when tracking. It would be nice to see what all the data is representing like health, elevation, etc. also Can’t create waypoints. Hopefully it’s just a simple fix. Has to be a bug. | And now.   lol.  Start a new track and hike several miles.  Each time you turn your screen off and come back to the application or switch apps and come back the map re-centers on the starting spot.  :-(. They also at these new prices need to have faster download servers. Crazy slow. Still the bat hiking application. But still they had feature in there watch application that made it useful for real backpackers. They added features but still feel the need to remove the ability to spy on a phone based track from the watch. I don’t even install the watch application. How is that battery going to track its own separate track with gps and last for days or weeks? You know one cannot charge the Apple Watch without removing it? But the old app allowed me to run the real track on my phone and just check progress on the watch. It was perfect. Instead they kill that feature raise the price to the point where a year costs as much as five years did a couple years ago. Sigh. I mean really if I want a non-intergrated Apple Watch hiking application then I will just use the one built in from Apple. The old application allowed for a real backpacking experience that I get grated the longer and renewable battery life of the phone with the ability to quickly check progress on the watch. Now if you have a trip longer than a handful of hours then the Watch application is worthless. | I found the interface on this app to be clunky and not at all intuitive. I really miss the old Motionx GPS.  Sadly this one doesn’t measure up. | I cannot login or reset my passpord!
I've tried millions times and sent tons of emails,received nothing yet.
NO ONE response to my request but the BILL OF THE SUBSCRIPTIONS COMES ON TIME! | Good app. I like it better than other competitors like OnX or Avenza. Three stars because they raised the price so much—even for longtime subscribers. Not cool. | The app was barely worth $40, developers upped the price to $60 without adding any useful features or fixing bugs. I’m out, downloading CalTopo | No need to expound on all the great features of this app. Some warts this far: 1) Elevations are hit or miss. Routes that you add typically don’t have consistently meaningful elevations—you have to create the route then edit -> “look up elevations”. And even then the elevations aren’t the same between the phone app and browser app. 2) App auto-routes and shows trails in areas that are definitely not open to the public (as in you’d need to climb over a clearly marked “no tresspassing” fence to use that path; this situation has arisen twice in 2 weeks). I ended up pairing this app with Strava’s global heatmap to make sure I wasn’t heading the wrong way. Why can’t Gaia GPS partner with, say, Strava or Garmin to crowd-source viable routes for hiking? Or at least clearly identify private property? | I rely on Gaia for backcountry navigation. It has become unusable. I open the app and it freezes within a minute. Now its crashing within seconds of opening it. I’ve reach out to support and have received no help. I’m going to start using CalTopo since that app has yet to crash on me. I really wish Gaia could get back to me with what is wrong because I like the app. It’s just downright unsafe to use the way I need it. | I loved Gaia maps, but a 50% increase? No thanks! | Got out for the first real hike in awhile.  Wanted to find some waypoints I saved years ago.  My position on the map floats all over the place and is very inaccurate.  I can stand still and the cursor floats all over the map.  Running up to date software in an iPhone 14 Pro Max. | I literally just entered a local major street in a major city and it didn’t even come up as an option on the list of places! | I’ve been using Gaia for years and have recommended it to dozens of people. Unfortunately it has really started going downhill and is often unbearably slow. Map layers take forever to load, and downloads typically stall out and never finish, particular for satellite layers. Unless this is resolved, I’ll be switching to OnX or CalTopo after my subscription ends (also they doubled the price, which if the app worked well would be tolerable, but it doesn’t…) | I thoroughly dislike the new Gaia UI. The record button is on the map page and I often find my track paused or deleted entirely, likely from having my phone back and forth from my pocket. 
The record button doesn’t need to be on this page. Users don’t frequently stop and start tracks. I do check the map often when off trail, the worst time to have my track disappear.
I preferred having three options for my hike data, now only allowed 2 because record permanently takes one slot. | I was excited to use this app on my Apple Watch for guidance while hiking.  Created my first map, and I attempted to load it on my Apple Watch. Runs up to 100%, but no map shows up. Bey disappointed for the cost of this app. | Don’t know what happened with the latest update but it now takes 30-60 seconds to load app and it keeps freezing while tracking in the record mode. This use to be my go to map program but this latest update seems to move app backwards. Horrible update. Why do you keep taking something that works and ruin it. Going to another app. | I’ve had this app for over a decade and this bug has persisted. It keeps launching in the background which drains my phone’s battery. The dev team seems to be unable to patch this. Very disappointing! | Great app for hiking! I float / canoe many rivers and it would be great to have a gps overlay that shows specific river data and mileage markers to plan a multi-day canoe trip.  Also the ability to create a route and select a mode “canoe”. 
Do the developers have any plans to include this ability or information?  Thanks! | It’s useful but they just doubled the price without adding features. I cancelled my subscription and am using All Trails. | I’ve been using Gaia GPS for years, and I’ve recommended it to everyone I know- friends, family, random people I meet on the trail.  The app has been buggy at times, but overall, I’ve enjoyed using it. 

All those glowing words of praise are about to come to a screeching halt.

I just received notification that Gaia is so proud of themselves that they have decided to give themselves a 66% raise!!!!  That’s right.  They are jacking up the annual subscription fee from $39.99 to $59.90!   I can see a 5% or even a 10% increase to keep up with inflation, but really???  SIXTY SIX PERCENT???

Pretty ridiculous move guys.  I hate to break it to you, but you’re delusional.

Peace out. | What good is it to create waypoints that you can’t use to create a route?",4.80837,29990,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/61/5d/32/615d321e-46f7-eeab-169f-8e928a170dec/2b50ecc9-6ec8-4054-9fc4-7ac34796bc02_IPHONE_55_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e2/e1/95/e2e19572-0176-a515-692c-536592046aea/7554b572-cf76-4004-83f6-83db7919f316_IPHONE_55_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/31/85/9e/31859ed7-752e-b307-a98d-27ed26728eef/30909809-d64d-48f9-b741-f54456cc188e_IPHONE_55_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/c5/38/1a/c5381a26-0463-dae8-5d69-1aa4abb08b66/52a46ec3-76e6-4c2b-80db-7c70cd52d4f6_IPHONE_55_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/6b/e0/d4/6be0d487-be0b-d2f1-ca50-e70b4eb7848c/940e548d-97ab-40c2-89cc-c17f374635e1_IPHONE_55_05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/54/7e/ad/547ead8e-22d2-8b1b-b8ac-8f03307dc844/8f74e7e1-f1cf-4cc1-b0b7-51ab0af6c9e4_IPHONE_55_06.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/3e/b0/aa/3eb0aa28-d7fd-4259-39bc-2270cb803690/07797c8a-4c5a-430c-9588-6e37f60b4463_IPHONE_55_07.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/f0/62/f2/f062f247-f3a1-a579-fdbc-c04ddcca5b18/991d4c41-9620-470b-849b-64a2e277c1ca_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129_01.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/87/35/48/873548d4-05ef-4730-e699-a6bc37315cc4/678da331-ee51-4bf2-b9c5-109d36eff5fd_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129_02.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/3a/cd/be/3acdbec9-faf3-d8fb-14db-a31447d63d12/de2bc24d-ad43-45d3-affa-a27ab3cb8a73_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129_03.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/cf/20/f9/cf20f9ef-9f5d-f207-2690-4d7b462b455b/2ef33b9f-78b4-44dd-bcc8-77e3e7995908_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129_04.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/35/be/b9/35beb908-08c1-2426-60d8-78fdfeb23359/20381e86-5f4f-4efe-9a1f-2ea3893904d9_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129_05.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e1/fe/05/e1fe05da-d535-b3ea-c19b-d5f00229092c/f981429c-f7d0-4a5f-b1af-e7f3121356a9_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129_06.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/54/62/e7/5462e769-5e5f-5834-8e10-15b719e2a7fd/ceafcc30-24f9-4e6a-a960-f29a730c986c_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129_07.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""i

Also with the part tense we used to be able to add “it rained” to translate to the passé composé and then “it was raining” to translate to the imperfect. But now it also ignores our input and decides on its own. This defeats the purpose of its not translating what I’m telling it I want.

However, despite its widespread popularity, Google Translate is not without its flaws. In this essay, we will explore the limitations of Google Translate from the perspective of an individual named Omar, highlighting its inadequacies and the challenges it poses in accurately conveying meaning across languages.Paragraph 1: One of the primary criticisms of Google Translate stems from its inability to capture the nuances and complexities of human language. Languages are rich with cultural references, idiomatic expressions, and contextual meanings that are often lost in translation. As a result, Google Translate frequently produces inaccurate or nonsensical translations that fail to effectively communicate the intended message.Paragraph 2: Moreover, Google Translate struggles with grammatical accuracy and syntax, leading to awkward and confusing translations. Languages vary significantly in their sentence structures and grammatical rules, making it challenging for a machine translation system to generate coherent and grammatically correct output consistently. Omar often finds himself frustrated by the jumbled and disjointed translations provided by Google Translate, which hinder effective communication with others.Paragraph 3: Furthermore, Google Translate's reliance on statistical algorithms and machine learning models means that its translations are susceptible to errors and inaccuracies, particularly with less commonly spoken languages or dialects. Omar, who speaks a minority language, often encounters mistranslations and misinterpretations when using Google Translate, highlighting the limitations of the service in capturing the nuances of diverse linguistic contexts.Paragraph 4: Another significant drawback of Google Translate is its lack of context awareness. Language is inherently contextual, with meanings often dependent on the surrounding words, phrases, or cultural references. However, Google Translate operates in isolation, devoid of the contextual understanding that humans possess, resulting in translations that lack depth and accuracy. Omar frequently encounters misunderstandings and misinterpretations due to Google Translate's inability to grasp the context of his communications.Paragraph 5: Furthermore, Google Translate's reliance on user-generated content and crowd-sourced translations introduces a risk of inaccuracies and inconsistencies. While user contributions can enhance the coverage and quality of translations, they also open the door to errors, biases, and misinformation. Omar has encountered numerous instances where translations provided by Google Translate were misleading or incorrect, leading to confusion and frustration.Paragraph 6: In addition to its linguistic shortcomings, Google Translate has been criticized for its limited support for minority languages and dialects. While the service covers a wide range of languages, it often prioritizes widely spoken languages at the expense of lesser-known ones. Omar, whose native language is not supported by Google Translate, faces significant barriers in accessing accurate translations, highlighting the service's neglect of linguistic diversity.Paragraph 7: Moreover, Google Translate's lack of transparency regarding its translation methodologies and algorithms raises concerns about the reliability and accuracy of its output. Users like Omar are left in the dark about how translations are generated and the factors that influence their quality, making it difficult to assess the trustworthiness of the service. Without transparency, Google Translate's credibility is called into question, undermining its utility as a translation tool.Paragraph 8: Additionally, Google Translate's performance varies widely across different languages and language pairs, with some translations being more accurate than others. Omar, who communicates in multiple languages, often finds inconsistencies in the quality of translations provided by Google Translate, further diminishing his confidence in the service. The lack of consistency adds another layer of uncertainty to the already challenging task of cross-linguistic communication.Paragraph 9: Furthermore, Google Translate's translations are often characterized by a lack of fluency and naturalness, making them sound stilted and artificial. Languages are not merely systems of symbols; they are living, dynamic entities shaped by culture, history, and social interactions. Google Translate's mechanical approach to translation fails to capture the nuances of language usage, resulting in translations that feel robotic and devoid of human touch.Paragraph 10: In conclusion, while Google Translate has undoubtedly facilitated communication and connected people across linguistic boundaries, its limitations cannot be overlooked. From inaccuracies and inconsistencies to a lack of context awareness and transparency, Google Translate falls short in meeting the diverse and complex needs of its users, including individuals like Omar. As technology continues to evolve, it is imperative that we recognize the shortcomings of machine translation systems like Google Translate and work towards developing more sophisticated and reliable solutions that truly bridge the gap between languages and cultures. | This app constantly freezes and doesn’t work.

Maybe not translation accuracy, but app ease of use, practicality, etc. I rarely write reviews. My latest complaint: why on earth would you not include the romanization of the translation on the typing screen. I get it shows when you click go, but for people who actually need to translate things with different meanings, the romanization really needs to be shown under the language while typing the words/sentences out in real time.

I frequently enter a word in another language to see if I have the correct tense, and it translates back to English as if it’s correct, but when I enter it back in, in English, it doesn’t translate to the other language the same way! And when I check online, I find it’s NOT correct! This app has become far too unreliable for use when I am needing accuracy for major Crossword creation, or any other use! I hope you will address these issues, and PLEASE return it to a normal size and font!!

This app has really gone downhill- very disappointing!! | …, CEBUANO!.., simple language to add!.., you have on the web.., so i am always having to go there…, PUT IT ON YOUR APP! | Почему Ваш переводчик пишет частично с маленькой, частично с заглавной буквы?! Неужели нельзя сделать автоматом, что новое предложение с заглавной буквы?! | THIS APP IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN TRANSLATE!!!!! This app is way better than translate because 1 there’s a little slip that I can touch that opens all the languages that I want, like there’s not on translate. And two translate is just a nothing app, and google translate is an EVERYTHING app. | I love this app when you need help on stuff like homework or something that is related to school work and I really recommend it if you’re struggling on any assignments or homework because you just need to take a picture of the assignment and it translates it into English or whatever language you want it to look like it’s really good and easy to use. It doesn’t cost you anything to do it and it’s really simple, I really recommend it you should try it out on your own. | Good day,
Whatever happened to the paste button on the app? That was the option on the app that I used the most.
Can we please fix that 

Thank you | I can’t get past the pay to use screen.

Just. Do. Not. Very user UNfriendly. | MGM pearl member and mgm credit card holder and I’ve never received a free bet or room! They don’t value loyal customers they told me if I was a new customer I would receive better offers. Worst casino in Ohio and lower end casinos and hotels in Vegas. Choose ceasers every time if you’re smart! | Can't book a room. | As an MGM app user I expect that basic functionality should work such as searching for room availability for travel dates and j keep getting error. Digital experience is really important in 2023 and it looks like MGM brand is struggling to keep up with basic functionality! Please find a new digit agency that can build an app which is functional! | App is decent for the most part but it’s soooo slow anymore. Just trying to look up rates and book a room takes forever. | It changed my account numbers without let me know | The app gets so laggy when trying to book a room! Definitely needs some work! | The app is great for navigating your stay and helping you accommodate your stay. But the one thing that kept this rating from being 5 stars is if you happen to arrive early to the hotel for whatever reason the app still makes you wait until almost 3pm to check in. And that's horrible when your watching everyone else come in after you and walk up to the desk and get rooms. Please fix that MGM!!!!! | The app is so glitchy that doing the simplest thing takes forever. It’s so frustrating 😖  App is also not designed well. | Every time I come to MGM the digit room key does not work | The app makes you upload your ID to check in, but it doesn’t actually work. It glitches and then sends you back saying it can’t be verified. Very frustrating experience. | I am trying to sign up for a new MGM account and both the app and the website force me into an incredibly laggy signup (not new member) form that generates an error and lets me proceed no further. 

So I’m supposed to use this app to register for my hotel room and open my door without a keycard?  No chance I am trusting this. Please get the basics right first | You need to scan your “digital key” in the elevator in order for it to go to your floor. Unfortunately our digital did not work for the elevator, so we ended up getting stuck on random floors and having to use the stairs to get to our floor. Fortunately the digital key did work for our room. | Just checked out of Bellagio rm #15038 but charges were added to my account. Bellagio buffet charged us instead of using my husband Danilo Puniesto food and beverage comp of $150. Pls correct this error. Thanks Hilda 97911913 | Was in Vegas the year and a half ago concert will never go back was that the roulette tables just win Coved was ending still wearing masks, but allowed to smoke. The pit supervisor was very aggressive and very mean about my smoking actually shut down the game board on us or the roulette table and was told as long as I'm smoking not to spin the wheel and then also said, I hope you get Covid and die complain to the pit manager, but they really except apologize. This would've been November 2 and third gonna say 2021 also, my wife died from Covid and my son also passed away in 2020 so this was crushing. Did write a complete, but never heard anything back. | Won’t let me check in. Doesn’t say why. Makes me call the front desk. Will delete this stupid app. | This company does just the minimum to secure your personal information and compromise your cc and SSN multiple times in several years without learning their lessons. | They are not back to normal…. Avoid mgm hotels at least for now | Seldom does this app recognize my trip even if I have the confirmation code. Most often the digital key can’t be activated. Frequently down for maintenance. Tells me to check in at the front desk. I’d expect more since they have so many properties. Not worth using this app until they get their act together. | Can you please tell me when the app will be up and working again? I can’t see my points nor book through the app, just nothing. | When do you expect app to be up and running? | Ruined my vacation plans with trash cybersecurity 

Can’t access my free nights 

Garbage company | Cancelled my trip because they are not crediting rewards. | app not working | Nothing on the app has worked for weeks even though MGM is stating otherwise. Can’t access booked trips, offers, rewards, and room key. No features are working. | When will the app be back up and running for booking and my rewards | I had to update my review. This was my fav app until it got hacked. It’s been about a week now. Can’t see any earned rewards or booked upcoming stays. Not sure if the hacker have retrieved my information. Have to spend extra money now on new trips. Thanks a lot! | It’s been over a month and I haven’t been able to see my rewards balance. The app says the MGM Rewards is undergoing maintenance. Even at the resorts and casinos the rewards aren’t working and you can’t redeem your rewards. I think that for a company this big a problem like this shouldn’t take this long to be resolved. Guess I’ll have to stick with Caesar’s Rewards, never had a problem there. | You download the app hoping to do mobile checkin as is promised, and then still stand in checkin line for an hour because mobile checkin doesn’t work. | The app has been undergoing maintenance for more than a week. | The best when it comes to promotional rewards and they always give you bonus bets on sports or free spins at the casino when other apps give you little to nothing. I can appreciate a Sportsbook that gives back to their  customers when times are rough and bet mgm looks out for me. Keep up the good work and good luck to everyone 🍀 | MGM got hacked by ransomeare. Theo app hasn’t worked at all for the past two weeks. Poor customer service. | When will the app be available? Already bought flights and can’t book a room… | Tried to sign on to this app and got a pop up that says the site is “undergoing maintenance” and I could not access anything.   This has been going on for two days now.  Nothing on the app works and whenever I click on anything it says the site is down and “undergoing maintenance”.  I find out in the news that the site was hit by a cyber attack and was shut down because of that.    They could have just been honest and up front with customers and said that from the start.   When they lie about it and claim it is “maintenance” it means they probably have something to hide.  I will likely switch to Caesar’s because of this as I would prefer to do business with a more reputable company. | Do I seriously have to update multiple times a week nothing ever changes | Requiring an app to get a room key is obviously terribly slimy, but asking for my drivers license to get a copy of a room key when my spouse is already checked in is ludicrous. | I KEEP GETTING STUCK WHEN I SHARE PERMISSIONS. BUGGY. | iPhone 14 Pro

MGM rewards are good but this app is pretty bad. Slow to update prices. I have to restart the app after checking prices for one property if I want to check another. It slows down and pauses. Need to make it more efficient and work better. | Did digital check in the night before. The digital key got stuck on preparing for hours after my supposed early check in time. 

Called and it still didn’t fix. | This is a great app. It’s all inclusive for your stay at a mgm property.  I was checked in and at my room skipping a massive line. I was checked in 30 mins before arriving at the hotel.  It has access to parking, elevators, and doors. Zero reason to get a key.

But when I’m at the pool I’d often leave my phone in the room.  If it had a watch add on I can then access my bio lock on my door instead of using my phone. | Booking through the app wasn’t bad, but checking in and using the mobile key was a terrible experience. Using the mobile key is also a terrible experience. | Great promise and the digital key is great when it works …. which is not very often. Last stay it worked for the room but not for the elevator. This stay it worked for the elevator but not for the room. Do yourself a favor before you arrive and navigate to find the QR code in the app. It’s not obvious but you’ll need it when you go to the front desk to make yourself a digital key.

State Farm is needs an excuse to raise your rates.  Instead of incurring an event by slamming on your brakes to avoid the jerk that cut you off just go ahead and hit him and let State Farm deal with the claim.  Coming up on a stale yellow?  Don't hit the brakes, take your chances and run the red light.  The app is stupid.  It makes sense to track when people use their phone when driving or when they are speeding.  But I get dinged a lot for defensive driving incidents. I'm doing State Farm and myself a favor by avoiding an accident. But they want to use it to raise rates. | This app is very sensitive! If you go around a corner at or slightly below the post speed it dings you for to fast. The same is true for braking.  To avoid a lower score you have to go well below the speed limit on a curve often resulting in getting honked at. Seems ridiculous to me! | Broken, useless app | The cornering is way to sensitive! | This application is wrong because it always says that I go 10 or more miles of what I actually I go. | In normal city driving where the yellow light duration is pretty short expect to get dinged on your score often.

This app seems to encourage users to run yellow lights in order not to get dinged on their score.

The braking algorithm sensitivity needs to be changed to be more realistic with normal city traffic light timing. | I’m one week in and I do not like it. It’s saying accelerating and covering. I’m I need to accelerate after I start my turn so the people behind me don’t hit me. I also don’t understand why I’m paying the same as my sister, yet she doesn’t have to deal with this. Lastly, it accessed my phone 31 times in an hour that I had it set at always. I was not in my vehicle, so why does it need to access my phone? I would rather pay more than have this device in my vehicle.

I’m months in, it keeps kicking me out making me reset my password, but doesn’t tell me that, just won’t aspire me to reset without calling the help desk. 

It accesses my location when I’m not using the app or driving. Too personal. | I would give it 5 stars if it would record ALL my driving. It's way to sensitive on the braking. | The discount is great and the feedback informative. 

The addition of some simple code to allow setting the default phone for a vehicle is needed. 

It is very cumbersome having to reclassify who the driver is. Since I always help my wife into any car, she becomes the designated person. The process for reclassifying is not simple.  Code could be added to allow designating a default phone for each vehicle. Then only in unique cases would there need to be a change. The option to change drivers by a simple button should also be made through interacting with a summary list of trips.

The app also is highly sensitive in small cars (little weight) resulting in acceleration and braking events. The heavier vehicles seldom identify events. 

Speed is set to trigger at 8 miles over. This margin is minimal on the interstate based on traffic and situations. 

But…the discount is great and the information interesting. | I get downgraded just for having the gps on while I’m driving.  Pulling out into traffic at a normal speed dings acceleration and stopping without getting the finger behind me dings my braking | Many times braking is not reasonable as you must stop quickly to avoid accident or injury to a pedestrian. | Breaking is not realistic too sensitive | The speed limits are VERY inaccurate. I keep getting dinged for do 73 miles per hour in a posted 75 zone, the app says it’s a 55 mile per hour area. The hard braking is also very unrealistic. Other than that it’s  ok. | If I have to spend any more time trying to get this ridiculous app to work I’m gunna switch insurance companies. What a stupid waste of time! | Whenever I get on this app it takes forever. I have been on it now for 45 minutes trying to update my odometer reading | Way too sensitive on cornering. | It marked me for hard braking 9 times just leaving my driveway at 5 mph. 
It marks me for sharp turning if I turn faster than like 7 mph. I’m not just gonna stop dead in the road and wait 10 seconds to turn, that’s how you get in wrecks.
I DONT BELIEVE ANYONE HAS A PERFECT SCORE BECAUSE THE APP IS BUILT FOR YOU TO FAIL. | My iPhone alerts me frequently that this app is tracking my every movement. Even if I’m no where near the beacon. It’s always tracking. What does State Farm do with all my personal data that doesn’t involve me driving? | The discount is good but I shouldn’t have to leave my location on all the time or the Bluetooth. I sometimes go days without driving my vehicle so I keep my Bluetooth off. Then it’s annoying pop up after pop up from the app saying to turn on Bluetooth. There’s a better way. | It is an invasion of privacy to select always in a location app. | There’s a role that I drive on that says I’m speeding every time I go on it and the speed limit is 55 and I drove 45 on it and it said I was speeding | I don’t think my trips are being recorded.  I called the phone number on the app and the rep said there were problems with the app.  I thought he fixed it but I still can’t see any information about my trips | The app is okay but I have an electric vehicle. The app/device is calibrated for a gas car. My electric car accelerates much faster than a gas car so I get events for my acceleration every time I drive. And I am a pretty conservative driver so I hate getting dinged for it every time.  So my acceleration score is in the 70’s. | Yes in 2024 this is apparently still a challenge.  No, can scan the back of my license to register.  No, wont accept manual entry of license number.  Out of luck. | My awareness and driving has not changed I see that I am being reviewed I guess that’s apart of being retired. I don’t get in any hurry for I know I have all day to get where I am going, I am so glad our insurance went down in price as it should be for the elderly. | It comes with a Jake brake which saves me gas and brakes wear. But every time I use it, I get hit for excessive braking . | I still haven’t figured out the cornering requirements. I have to make a U-turn when leaving home. Most of the time it dings me whether I crawl through the turn or go at a normal speed.  

As for braking, I’ve learned it requires you to ride your brakes a lot. The money I may end up saving will probably be used for new brakes. I was taught not to ride the brakes, go figure. I too have gone through yellow lights to not get dinged. Not the best idea. 

Speeding and Accelerating. I now drive like one of those people who used to drive me crazy because they would take forever to get moving. Oh, I set my car to beep at me if I am speeding so I will immediately let off the gas pedal. I don’t hit my brakes because it will ding me, of course. 

Phone… don’t touch your phone unless you are at a complete stop. I have now memorized a couple of phone number so I can have my car dial the numbers. Remember when we actually knew phone numbers??  Lol

It will be interesting to see if I actually get a discount. Hmmmm???  With the cornering in the high 70s and the braking in the high 80s, I’m thinking they will bring down the others that I’ve managed to get to 10O.  Not sure yet if I’ll keep the app. | I’m currently on my third Beacon. Nobody at State Farm can explain why occasionally my reports contain only half of a trip. Actually, sometimes I report two different halves. Sometimes they don’t record one way at all. Other times they start in the middle of the trip.

Nobody at State Farm can adequately explain what they do with the data nor can they explain how my discount is calculated. | It dings you for hard breaking so much and I do not break hard. That’s very frustrating. I can’t use my phone for music or anything else because it dings you for that too. It’s unfair that those things drop your score. | I don’t understand why it Hass to detect when your phone is being used, when the passenger either be changing the music or checking the phone or using it for something not the driver that’s stupid. | Runs phone battery down. Dings you for braking on a hill when light changes to yellow. Dings for accelerating on turning left from a stop. | System does not always capture my driving. Sometimes it picks parts of my trips and at times none at all. | Sometimes when you drive people like to cut right in front of you, or come out out of nowhere so you have to break out of safety. It happens so often that even breaking from miles apart, it will still deduct point for breaking. How can you control other drivers from not cutting right into your lane at last minute? Literally only my breaking points are low even though I always drive at speed limit or slower to stay a good faaar distance from drivers ahead. Ridiculous. | Should not take away points as I use phone for navigation and music other than that I good | Latest update made the app unusable to open and review anything at all & just drains my battery. | All 100s! It took a while to modify my driving but now I’m a better driver. Yes, the braking component is harsh but I don’t see how it can be anything but consistent in its evaluation. Score high points in other areas and you’ll still save serious amounts on your premium! | If you come to a complete stop at a stop sign, especially if you were going slightly downhill, hard braking is triggered. All of my “scores” are around 100 except for the ridiculously sensitive hard braking measure. Apparently one should just roll through a stop sign so you don’t get dinged for hard braking. | The app misidentified the driver 50% of the time. The app shows a discount for my safe driving, but I see nothing on my bill showing this discount. I’m about ready to delete it. | The idea is good, the functionality is poor at best. You are penalized if you brake hard to avoid an accident, it perceives you are cornering to fast, in a mini van, really? Or it penalizes you for accelerating to fast to avoid a hazard or to get around a truck that blocks your vision of possible hazards. In theory a good idea, terrible functionality.
The only plus is that it has made me more aware of speed limit changes. | The app reports 'braking' incorrectly!
Not once have I braked because I was 'following too closely'!  I brake to avoid drivers that change lanes on a whim and those entering highways without checking traffic, dodging pedestrians, potholes and debris, etc. 
I repeat:  I do not follow too closely!
Acceleration:  occasionally one has to accelerate to avoid being hit!
If it weren't for the insurance discount, I would have removed the app because of the annoyance!  
On a positive note:  I've become adamant about not answering my cellphone while driving. 
If the app is sensitive to other factors, one would assume that the distance between the driver's car and the bumper of the car in front could be measured before the braking incident!
App developers: you asked for a review. I'm assuming that you want serious feedback and will address the issues. I'm sending a copy of my review to my insurance agent. 
I've been driving legally for 70 years and have not been in nor caused an accident. Am I not a careful driver? | It would be useful to have preferred driver for a specific car.   We have four drivers in our family and it will consistent choose the wrong driver by just connecting arbitrarily when two or more of us are in the car | I am typically the passenger in my car.  I want to open the app to record that I’m not the driver and the app doesn’t open | This app isn’t correct in driving info. It doesn’t take into account that a passenger using cell phone but app says driver is | While I appreciate any potential savings, so far it has not been worth the aggravation.  The app drains my phone battery, and don’t believe that it takes real life driving conditions into consideration. 

There are times when you have to speed up to avoid a accident, or likewise brake and swerve to avoid someone who cuts in front of you.  You will certainly get bad marks for taking any evasive action necessary to avoid an accident.

I’m constantly getting dinged for phone distractions, however my phone, (which I carry in my pants pocket) is never used when I’m driving.

The only way to consistently get good scores is to be the only car on the road. | The braking feature on drive and safe is not fair because I get penalized for a person pulling out in front of me.  I brake instead of getting into an accident should be rewarded not held against my score. | If you drive safe according to the app chances are you will cause an accident most other drivers don’t drive safe!! Just remember that big brother is always watching you! I wanted to give a one star but the app will not let me post! So I had to change it to five. I haven’t had a traffic violation or an accident in over 40 years that should show that I’m a safe driver but not according to State Farm | This App “dings” me for things that are not a reflection of my driving. For example, if a person pulls in front of me in traffic, even if I am keeping a good distance from the car in front of me, I have no option but to apply the brakes. Another example is being in a busy city, you have to accelerate when you pull onto the freeway. Not doing so, causes potential accidents. Nonetheless, the App sees acceleration and can’t understand the necessity for it in some circumstances. | I look at the app all the time.  It makes me more careful to be sure my numbers stay good. | I have noticed that if you move the phone without being on the phone from the side if you body to a point in the car to charge the phone you will be hit with a breaking.  It’s like the phone is moving and it suddenly stops.  This has caught mr several times and I have reported it to my agent. | I like the app overall, it works well and is easy to use. The only thing that’s an issue is how it measures braking. I consider myself a very safe driver but I pretty frequently get docked for a “braking event” during a driving trip, due to things like a light turning yellow and me stopping fairly quickly or braking so I don’t hit a car that’s pulled out in front of me. I don’t follow closely, so at least I don’t take a hit braking for that, but it’s frustrating to lose points when I’m braking out of necessity and it would be reckless not to.",4.5507,264845,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/8a/7c/b2/8a7cb21f-065d-463b-cc6f-a862b8541beb/58f45f27-91f4-41ff-9f86-5374dbd185ed_5.5_Display_-_Screenshot_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/54/0b/44/540b44de-010f-7c7c-cfd5-53c399d16671/85571ab4-b9d3-4ff4-951a-11d95ccb269f_5.5_Display_-_Screenshot_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ed/19/35/ed19359a-32aa-30d9-dbdd-d7f6060f6a2e/df18bfad-7e94-46f4-bff8-acef9dba58d2_5.5_Display_-_Screenshot_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/14/1a/b3/141ab3ff-4f22-e59b-8638-6af16e9fa705/d2fa8aa8-0393-4793-aab1-bfbec271c2db_5.5_Display_-_Screenshot_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1a/6f/17/1a6f172c-63fa-ddd9-87d9-55383d4705c6/9e84c078-e268-4f0e-89fc-101c92f29dd5_5.5_Display_-_Screenshot_05.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

A subscription is needed to play the game, which is a bad model for gamers unless they’re serious about the game. I’d be happy to pay a one time fee of $5 and play the game every now and then, but a few dollars a month is not a good basis for casual gamers like myself. Other games that require subscriptions, like chess.com provide lessons and professional developments tutored to the players with many updates, but that’s not really a possibility with this type of game - and if it is they haven’t implemented it well. | Really fun game but the subscription saying I don’t have it when I do is really annoying | The overall game is good but the fact that I have to pay to play makes it to where I can only play every 7 hours. 1 star | I just got the game and already deleted it I got 5 places to guess for the entire day and then it asked me to pay 3.49$ to play for the entire month | Rterwhetjryktuyiujkretrytu | Trails was my favorite game mode, so sad to see it gone. Please consider bringing it back! | I thought this would be fun to play, as I love testing my geography knowledge. I was very disappointed that now you have to pay for everything. Fun and education should not be blocked by a paywall. | I loved it but after playing 7 rounds I had to wait 8 hours to play again | This was one of my favorite games but now it’s unplayable due to crashing. | I dedicated way too much time on trail mode just to open the app again on a random afternoon and ITS GONE. like it’s all i used this app for and now it’s just gone along with all of my progress. Saddening and sickening. | Tons of fun | Trail Mode use to be the only reason id get on the app, level 356 and now it’s gone. Sad | As a subscriber who has not been able to use the app for over a week.  Please revert the opening screen back to the previous one so I can use this app.

PS consider another graphics designer who understands apps.  Spinning stars should not be that hard | I used to love this game but they recently had an update and when ever I try to play solo it will glitch on me and kick me out of the app. When I go back in to play it says I already used my one free game and have to wait another 8 hours to play. This has been going on for a bout a week now and I still haven’t been able to play a single game. FIX YOUR GAME!!!! A holes | It’s a fun and addictive game that is more interesting than you think! However, you have access to absolutely nothing without paying first. There are also different subscriptions for the mobile app and for the web-based version for some reason(!), even when you log in to the same account on both. Be aware of that before you pay for anything, which you have to do to have access to any part of the game.
Fun game but everything is locked behind a paywall. | Really only like a total of 5-7 games free then I have to pay monthly to keep playing I’d be fine paying a one time fee of like $5 MAYBE $10 but subscriptions these days are getting out of hand I feel like I need one for everything now and the company only responds by saying “you get 7 free games and if you want more you can buy pro” acting like that isn’t what everyone is complaining about, honestly just go online and find a free version. | I love this game so much, it’s really hard and forces you to learn so many tips and tricks to get good at it. Unfortunately with the new update it crashes nonstop so please fix it!!! | Downloaded again after not playing for some time. App doesn’t stay ip for a minute before crashing. | App immediately crashes any time you leave the title screen.

Great game, terrible app | crash every 5sec on iphoneX | it's bad only lets you play like once a day and the 😂😕🥺😎😅😣😍🙁😂😡rest you have to pay for it is baffoonery one star | YOU HAVE TO BUY STUFF TO PLAY THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER | Crashes my iPad Pro. Terrible. Needs a fix. | I try to login I log in for like three secondsAnd then they log me out | The game kept crashing when ever I was in the middle of a round. I lost all my games, and now I have to buy them. I tried everything to resolve this problem. | The app crashes constantly, don’t waste your time | I really loved this game for so long, now I can’t skip a puzzle of any type. I’m not paying a bunch of money for something I only pick up a couple of times a month. that and the new look is absolute garbage. | I used to consider myself to be a casual enjoyer of GeoGuessr, that changed with the removal of the free games and the single player infinity mode. Change…it…back! | It’s a pay to play game because you can only play 1 ranked game and the rest is just path mode it awful | My game does not work since the update, it crashes every time I try to play. | Crashes when I open it. SMH I was so excited to play this. | You get to guess we’re you are but some times it is hard for some kids. | I love this app so much, it’s my favorite game. But I hate that you have to pay! I would rather have ads, then pay for an ad free option if I want. | My son downloaded this game for “education” purposes. I haven’t seen him in five weeks. He sits in his room ALL DAY. I try to get him outside and he refuses so that he can drink his “Gamer-Juice.” (It’s really just his sweat mixed with some leftover water.) He tried feeding it to me and I puked. The doctor said hes on track to be 8 foot, 575 pounds. DO NOT GET. | I used to love this game, and had everything unlocked. The most recent update added a pay-wall preventing me from using the previously unlocked features/locations. This seems shady, and unethical. | Don’t play, you actually have to pay and they don’t tell you | Something is happening to everyone now using this. ANYTIME someone clicks the map it then zooms everyone else out. Super SUPER annoying | Very great
Good maps 
Good people | I cant play beyond 5 games because I'm a broke little jobless middle schooler but this is still desperate content and i found a way to play past 5 games for free all right heres the steps
1.get a random ip generator
2.open google maps but have a friend open to the spot 
3. Guess
4.after you lock in your guess check the real answer 
5. Have fun and enjoy life without any microtransactions
Remember geoguesser is just a game of pick and guess but on the map | Now 70 second wait before each round. It appears to increase by 10 seconds every new game we play. It’s also not synchronized. My girlfriend seems to have 3-20 seconds less than me. This is absurd. | i just purchased a pro account and every duel i play i have a 30 timer before i guess and ive lost over 40 elo because of this issue | It is undemocratic to put a fun, educational game behind a paywall. Give me geoguessr back please:( | I’m starting games with a 40 second wait while others have the ability to start right away. Fix this please. | It was really good, bought the premium version. And then it started having too many bugs, most recently the time one, where you have to wait 40 seconds before each round and sometimes even more. | Whenever I start a duel game with my friends, the count down for me would be 40 seconds while my friend would have a normal count down of 4 seconds. | I payed for the pro mobile subscription and ever since my countdown timer before every game is really high. I have to wait 20-90 before I can guess and by then the game is usually over. Otherwise fun game. | There is a bug. Every time i play multiplayer the other players can guess countries while the time is ticking but on my screen it still says waiting 80 seconds to start game and the Second i can start no matter what point the timer is on the round ends | I had to download pro for $4/month and the duel games are so bad!! One player gets a 45 second head start so the host has no chance to guess!! Do not spend money on this app as it is the biggest scam ever. | I loved playing this game before they made so you had to pay a subscription to even do a round. I’m was free with limitations, but at least I could play. I would appreciate if they would go back to the previous subscription options | Very cool game but developers just crazy, u cant play it for free as usual, u will lose your community.

Makes claims credit card is a duplicate card on file (when one doesn’t exist) and once credit card is taken makes you restart parking selection. So many better parking apps out there. Not sure why any city would go with this app. | It’s more convenient to use the parking meters at my local VTA parking stations that also don’t charge random convenience fees for using an inconvenient app. | I had to download this to park and it told me every spot that was vacant was unavailable for purchase. The app is horrible. I had to go to the physical machine to purchase the ticket after realizing the app doesn’t work and I ended up being late to my appointment. | I tried 3 different payment cards and all got declined through payments in the app. Using a card in the parking machine worked fine. It should be a simple process but it’s really frustrating. | every single payment method gets this error: ""Payment Failed
Payment could not be processed.
Please check the accuracy of your payment information, select another payment method, or pay at the meter.""

yall need to fix your app!! | This app refuses to recognize any payment method for reloading my account. What is the use of this??  This app is in desperate need of an update. | To get this app to work I usually have to delete the stores payment information and re-enter it every time I want to use it. Much easier to use a credit card. I will be deleting it. | Paid for full-day parking through their app, double checked to make sure everything looks right, still got a citation saying I did not pay despite the parking session being still active at that time!!! | I’m not entirely amazed by this app, but it does the job. You can pay for parking, and see how much time you have left. The UI is a little rough and no dark mode but it works. Only thing I don’t like is Apple Pay never works. The app always throws an error saying payments aren’t working right now, but then manually entering the same card’s number works fine.

If they could fix Apple Pay the app would be a 4 star. | Around 20% of the time when I use this app, it goes through the basic motions of confirming the parking spot, all the cool lights spin in world like it’s a successful payment, and then I get to the restaurant and I check to see how much time I have left on my parking and it tells me the payment was not confirmed and so my session never began. This Russian roulette makes this app all but useless. You can imagine the anger of getting a ticket when you think you’ve paid for parking. In each case, when it happens, there is nothing wrong with my credit card or payments, and in fact, if I noticed this problem and just rerun the parking it works every time. So there’s clearly something glitchy with this app. So, despite how clean it looks and how magical it all seems it is really a nightmare in disguise, as you’re never really sure that you’ve paid for parking, and it sends you no notification, your phone doesn’t beep ring or buzz when your payment somehow fails even though your banking situation is crystal clean. | I tried using Apple Pay and the app just crashes.  The app is updated and my os is the latest version.  I contacted their support and they said there was nothing they could do. | no option for Apple Pay which should just be default by now | This app is so temperamental. Doesn’t recognize the payment methods already added and refuses to validate when additional payment methods are added.
Thank goodness I am not pressed for time- really doesn’t sell the efficiency and ease of use. | This app has charged me so many times on top of making my payment. It could be a glitch in the app. Please fix that issue. I’m working near by and using the parking lot and have to pay every day and the additional charges are happing often. Definitely a god app but I am having this issues. I hope the owner of the app can make it right. | I used this app to pay for Metra parking at the Lockport station and it didn’t work!  After a long day at work, I found a $30 parking citation on my windshield.  I contacted Passport Parking to complain and all they did was say “sorry” and divert me to the police department.  I called the police department and they told me to attend the hearing.  So unless you want this burden, don’t trust this app. | This app is terrible. I’ve re entered 3 different credit cards and it always declines. Have to go to the crappy mobile web page to actually use it. | Many many tries but app continues to have issues. Other parking apps are so much easier and they work… not this one. | Won’t accept any of my cards despite them all being functional, and I am unable to do anything about it. When I try to input my card information, it declined me and says that card is already and use and continues to reject my payment. | Refuses to accept my payment method entered multiple cards and it won’t accept them or Apple Pay despite my Apple Pay working for everything else. | The app was last updated a year ago. Running the most current iOS, I keep getting “Network Error please try again later.” I’m not alone, as others that tried to pay and park were forced to use a kiosk since the app was not working. 

Tried troubleshooting by switching off WiFi, logging off, deleting and reinstalling the app, but nothing works. Now I can even log in and I get the same network error when I put in my phone # to verify. 

I am able to use the website to log in, but mobile web browser keeps pushing me to use the App (which is broken). Please release an update for iOS 17.4 | I tried three credit cards and none of them were accepted. | It’s quite useless to me but I do like the interface. Setup was quick and easy but it simply would not take either of my cards. | Payment page errors out continuously.  Tried a different card, tried Apple Pay and get the same error message.   Deleted profile, reinstalled app and payment still didn’t work.   Very frustrating. | This app is designed to GIVE YOU TICKETS. If you close the app while it’s still processing a payment, or even for a few seconds after paying, it won’t go through and you’ll get a ticket. If you click “max time” it only automatically selects about 15 min, so if you don’t notice then you’ll get a ticket. It only gives you an alert about ending parking time ONCE, 10 minutes before, with no way to change it, so if you don’t set a second timer for when parking is actually up to move your car or extend time, then you’ll get a ticket. It also doesn’t detect if the same car is already booked on a street before accepting payment, so it’s easy to double charge yourself for parking (my bf does parking in the mornings, I do afternoons). Awful app. | I plugged in my credit card info, but it won’t save the CVV, so this app is useless to me. | This app doesn’t allow me to reload, despite I’ve tried multiple cards. Got a parking ticket eventually. | Tried two cards that are valid and both failed. Also doesn’t take Apple Pay which is stupid. | Tried three cards. Payment failed. Tried to go to support. Says no internet. Tried connecting to WiFi and and cell. Total fail | Good idea for app but sometimes it will have a pop up that won’t let you pay. The app wouldn’t let me pay for my spot all morning, and when I finally was able to (by restarting the app 50 times and uploading different cards) I go outside and see I was ticketed 1 minute before I paid. 
Everything else in the app is decent but this glitch is not an acceptable bug. I don’t want my car towed because of a glitch in a system. | Paid on the app, got a ticket anyway, ticket appeal denied. Just pay the ticket after the fact, at this point don’t waste money trying to pay for parking. | This app doesn’t work more than half the time. Like most users reviews, it gives an error message when trying to pay. I’ve paid with multiple cards, deleted them and re-entered, deleted and redownloaded the app and experienced the same issue. I contacted support and I received automated responses that did not address this issue. It looks like this app hasn’t been updated by the company in a year. Any town/city who is using it is getting ripped off. | This is a solution that nobody wanted to a problem that didn’t exist. Just let me take a ticket and pay on my way out.

Today I forgot to log in my parking start time, I can’t go back and pay it in the app. I’m not sure what I’m going to have to deal with before I leave. It’s a pain. 

On top of that, I had to download an app to park in a garage that I may never park in again because I don’t live in the area. 

The need for an app also discriminates against people who don’t have smartphones, or don’t have a smartphone that is advanced enough to download the app. | Always issues with this app | I never write app store reviews but I was compelled to write one for passport parking. This app has two major flaws:
1) When using Apple Pay, there is a visa animation with a checkmark that appears PRIOR to completing a purchase. This gives the illusion that the payment went through and your session has started, despite it not. I have been ticketed because of this bug.
2) The app begins your session not from the time you check out, but from the time you start setting up a session. This is incredibly misleading. For example, you can open up the app at 1pm and take 10 minutes to check out (putting in license plate info, credit card, etc). You will get charged for 1 hour but your session will only be until 1:50PM. Profiting for the time spent checking out is inexcusable. | If everything goes smoothly, this app is fine for parking. Unfortunately, I’ve had attempts to pay fail for no apparent reason even when I enter multiple credit cards. Why payment can be so difficult on occasion is a total total mystery. Also, why can’t we use Apple Pay with this app, it seems like that would solve the problem? | Extortion | The app isn’t allowing me to pay for my meter! | So much copying and pasting just to pay for a weaselly parking spot. Please just add support for Apple Pay and Face ID. | The app kept giving a network error when trying to add my credit card. The network was fine. The support agent wanted to argue with me that parking is free on Sunday and not to worry about it. Even if that were the case, the app should give a man appropriate error not just something about the network. I just ended up walking to the machine and paying. | I sent them several emails and no body answered me , they took more 120$ for a parking worth 8$ 
Worst app ever | I’ve tried to use this app several times over the last year and the payment method always malfunctions.  I waste more time trying to unsuccessfully add a credit card; better off paying at the meter. | It’s nice and all but this app seems to never work whenever you really need it to. For example you’re in a hurry and need to pay as your walk to your destination after parking and the payment won’t go through. Very annoying and needs to be fixed. | The app was great in the beginning -  making it easy to park and pay quickly without having to use the machines that take forever. However, I’ve noticed recently the app keeps erroring out when trying to pay for my parking. This has resulted in 2 parking tickets. It’s super frustrating and will prob just use the old machines now since it’s more expensive using this app now. | This app is easy to use! I will say that it would be a great added feature if you could add time to the meter from your watch. Our courthouse does not allow cell phones so adding time from my watch would have been helpful. | App not accepting cards and no other way to sort payment.. | Several times I’ve returned to parking violation tickets on my car only to find out that the app had an error in processing my payment. It will chime when you hit the confirm payment button as if everything went through, but not send any notification if the transaction fails. | Repeatedly tried to park and there’s a bug that won’t let me pay. It thinks there’s no payment and when I enter a space it asks to set up new payment. Then it won’t let me add my card because it says the card I added already exists (but doesn’t access it when I need to pay). 

Issue has persisted for many weeks. I deleted and added back the app with no luck. | It starts counting the time when you open the app, it doesn’t matter if you are still looking for the spot number and entering your payment info. When you look at remaining time after the transaction, it always shows a few min less than the time you’re paying for

App also won’t allow you to renew the time in advance. You need to wait until the session expires to do so | Took literally 20 minutes to figure out how to park Downtown and then constantly got network errors from the app. | They charge a convenience fee. There is no other way of payment yet they charge this fee. I would happily pay differently if I could! I am waiting for fed regulations on this capitalism enabled type of fraud!",4.74923,96865,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/d2/63/be/d263bed8-7ce9-bfe3-6332-c9dcc4b4f88e/mzl.euedxlvg.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e7/5f/79/e75f7914-75d4-2bcc-be1c-dd4334fdeac8/mzl.gapulxax.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/01/06/78/01067842-6fea-3acd-6fc7-bb74f1803c6e/mzl.tquqqtwk.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/18/c4/9d/18c49d28-0978-1de6-39f4-2d9d9aa56c05/mzl.calzwtrg.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/b4/81/91/b48191c3-bf17-54d9-46e5-63ac79538bf5/mzl.znmtcpvh.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/72/36/40/72364046-79a5-90f9-0560-413db0a8bd26/mzl.qwrayzxd.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/47/00/d8/4700d86b-b851-2444-8541-2ea91eacab8c/mzl.drcpymns.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1f/97/d8/1f97d82f-8734-1ff4-497e-477ae6a30aef/mzl.cyfgqjwx.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/ef/f1/df/eff1dfa9-ffb4-9f5a-a09c-b94aa9161061/mzl.etueqdaw.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

However, I cannot add my parking reservation to my calendar.  The app is telling me I have denied access to my calendar.  I really hope this isn’t a ploy to prompt me to give full calendar access. | Don’t like when I pay for parking a week before and get to lot and it’s full. That’s a problem! | My earlier review was wrong. There was no phantom charge. | You are always fast easy abs convient, love your system! | I had never used park whiz before and downloaded the app solely to buy parking for a Tampa lightening game. There was no signage indicating where the valet team was located. I drove around for 45 minutes and I wound up paying for parking somewhere else. The Park Whiz team refused to give me a refund….After taking weeks to respond. Never again. | Went to concert in downtown Pittsburgh the same day and close location to when Pirates game was letting out. 

Stuck in traffic, getting a bit anxious, finally pulled up to garage and they were closed, EXCEPT for our prepaid pass.  
It was awesome. 

Don’t think we would have made our event if gad to find alternate parking. | I was charged for a booking I didn’t make!!! | I’ve used ParkWhiz before and it’s made finding parking easier. I don’t worry about where I’m going to park. | I am extremely upset. 
When I get to the location … every door was close.. no one to ask a question
I am late for my event , pay extra for my parking… 
And guess what , it is not the first time such thing happen.. 
if the company doesn’t have a control on the facility do not have available when it is not available 
How much money you will make with all the customer that doesn’t complain or ask for a refund back.. 
I have no words to describe how upset I am 
Knock the metal doors, try to enter by glasses door and nothing.. | Not sure if it me or app but took forever to get account set! | I paid WAY more for the price of parking than what the actual kiosk was charging. Do not use this app!! Just pay at the kiosk. | As a 76 year old with limited knowledge this app was easy to use
Thank you | I bought a parking spot and was told it was sent to the app. It did not show up. Customer service demanded a second email address for me which I refused to provide. They stole my 30 dollars and could not get me the parking pass at all.  Waste of time and theft of my money. Avoid this app at all costs. | Pricing and locations till now have been great. But I am still waiting for a response to my request for a refund several weeks ago. Parking spot was horrid. I submitted a claim and waiting for support | I was purchasing online and I had a notification to save $5 to book through app. I downloaded the app and followed the directions, but there is no way to get the $5 discount. It is only $5, but it’s the principle  Don’t be deceitful to get someone to download yet another app that probably won’t used  again in the foreseeable future! | Paid for parking at 64th street In Manhattan via app, when I arrived attend said you have to pay $30 more… | If I don’t scan the sign at the lot then I can never use the book again feature.  I can’t click it and it won’t open.  When I search the lot I park in it’s always a $60 rate when the sign says $8.
It is very frustrating.  I’ve tried signing out and USING my gmail account instead of Apple.  I deleted the app and added it back nothing works!! | I use the service a lot, but recently the app won’t let me sign in to my account. Says I have wrong username or password. I have no problem logging into the account through my web browser, just not the app. Inconvenient to have an app that doesn’t consistently work. 
**update** deleted app, reinstalled and was able to login. | No problems with ParkWhiz | Great deal on parking pretty close to the stadium. | Went to a parking garage downtown Chicago, and for one hour parking was $58, and $10 per each 20 minutes going over; found app so fast created a account and found parking near my actual location for $20 for three hours. Love this app! | Bought a parking pass and afterwards it asked me to download the app. Thought that would be easier than opening an email to get my pass. After downloading the app I had to create an account. Then it would not recognize my purchase and import my parking pass to the app. The app wouldn’t even let me log in even though I had created the account less than 5 minutes before. This app is useless. | The shuttle from the airport to parking was ridiculous!!  I called and they sent another van, then was going to refuse my party from getting on!  They never used the app until that moment, we had no luggage, so we should have been on the first vans there first, not the 8th, on person from our party was on the 6th van, because they kicked the two of us off, so we had to wait for the eighth but van to come. That van came they were going to not allow us on there and had to see our app. I questioned why they hadn’t use the app on the first they didn’t respond and my friend who was on the sixth was heckled all the way to parking from passengers and driver of why she was on there very disappointed!!!!!!! | These clowns have their own rules for parking. Make sure you read their signs on the way in otherwise they will fine you to no end. A giant fee if you log in to pay the parking fee after 10 minutes!  Beware also…you may not know you got a ticket until 2 months later. DIY parking at the worst! | No form field validation on license plate inputs, so if you put a dash or a space (like your real, legal license plate), you’ll get a ticket from the lot operator.

As a User Experience / Product Design professional with 20+ years experience in software design, this functionality could be researched and implemented in 1-2 dev sprints easily, all factors accounted for. This omission in functionality can only be summed up as “extortion.”

Lot operators use plate scanners and don't actually look at your paid parking thru this app or match your plate to your validation. Their Scanners remove spaces and special characters. So should this app.

The lot operator (Diamond Parking Services) gave me a “one time courtesy waiver of MY violation” given that it was my “first offense”

Talk about a horrible customer experience, having to deal with all that, and being blamed at fault and ‘splained to how dumb of a person i am.. And now I’m wasting more of my time posting this in hopes that a) they fix the issue and/or b) raise awareness for other customers, or better said “victims,” using this app. | I’ve been using this app for a while. All seemed fine then all of a sudden for the last month I’ve been having issues with the app. All of a sudden I was logged out, I can’t log back in, and I can’t get onto their website without getting an error. I’ve tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, restarting WiFi and nothing is working. I’ve reached out to tech support and they have not been very helpful. They sent me a PDF of one of my upcoming parking reservations, but never answered any questions about why I am having issues accessing the app or website. I’ve got parking already reserved AND PAID FOR for the NFL draft in a couple of weeks and no one has been able to assist. I am at a loss of what could be wrong, and not avenue seems to be helpful. I don’t recommend downloading this app currently. | 😕 | We used Park Whiz for an event in Indianapolis. Following the event, most of the exits were chained shut. This caused us to be unable to exit the parking lot for over an hour. We had a child with us and there were vehicles speeding through the lot, jumping curbs, drivers screaming and cursing- overall creating a scary and unsafe experience for me and my child. | Parking at my event was LESS in person than using this stupid app. | The last 3x I used the app, I pre-paid for a spot, only to be turned away by the attendant as the lots were already full. Getting refunded is also a chore.  Never again. Lost customer. | Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The app changed my request from 8 hrs to 24 hours, tripling the price. I tried to cancel within 30 secs and provided them with everything they asked for to get a refund and they gave me credit for future parking but would not refund. I will never use this app again for any reason. Spot Hero support is great. | Accurate, and so convenient to be able to reserve parking this way!! | Used the app twice for Tampa events, found it easy to book, pay and find the parking lot , fair pricing. The lot was easy, safe, walking distance to event. Well maintained lot and parking attendant friendly and helpful. No complaints would use again and recommend. | I got pretty cheap parking from this app and was happy AT FIRST. When I arrived at the garage there was no where to scan the QR code. I had to pay 48 dollars on top of what o paid in the app. I contacted customer service for a refund and they told me I parked at the wrong spot. Which is complete bullsh*t because I got the address from the app and even followed the pictures provided. I parked identical to what the app showed. When I told them this, I received complete radio silence. I will be disputing the charge and never using this app again. I do not at all recommend.

UPDATE: 
I contacted support again and they kept telling me I parked in the wrong spot. Turns out, the app gave me the wrong address. Even though it was the app’s mistake, they refused to give me a refund. I’m very upset with how they handled their mistake and refused to do anything but “flag the garage”. If the app is wrong, that is not my fault and I should have been refunded. This app is essentially a scam. I  would not trust this app ever. | I’m trying add extra time | Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Make sure to keep your email or a paper copy. App won’t have your purchased parking info/QR code always. | Easy to use | Love this app, no issues here in Chicago. | Been using this for years to get parking for shows in Las Vegas at the smith center. No other option, that’s why. 
Recent updates and improvements have changed the app so it defaults to charging you more than is needed. It used to always be the same price. Now it shows nearly double. You have to physically go in and edit the times needed so it is the correct price. Shady companies being shady. | I payed for my parking spot in advance through the app and when I approached to the screening panel to scan the code it didn’t worked, and I had to double pay for the parking. I wrote a message letting the app people know and tried to get in contact with someone for a reimbursement, and never heard back from anyone. Lost that money trying to get into a Parking lot in Pittsburg. ☹️ | About two thirds of the time the tickets I bought from them turned out to be bogus.  If you buy a ticket for sporting events there is a strong chance you will be turned around at the gate! I don’t know how they allow this to happen and at this point nor do I care.  I cannot buy any tickets from them anymore just in case.  If you are attending a sporting event particularly if the ticket is labeled for that event do not buy tickets from this site. | Second time I’ve used it -hate the interface. You have to zoom out to see what parking to pick. It doesn’t remember my license plate so I have multiple steps to not get ticketed. All so the facility doesn’t need customer support for parking. | Can’t pay if I can’t scan | When I parked, scanned the QR on the sign, downloaded app and see red the first location on the list of options, paid and went to the event. Turns out that the list of available locations are not in distance order so being a tourist and not knowing the town very well, I selected a parking lot that was 500ft west from the one I was. My car was towed, ParkWhiz has no one to assist you, had to pay the tow and dispute later. Took from early October until mid March to have a response. We will refund the Uber expense as a good faith gesture since it was user fault that you select the top parking location on the app and not the he third down the list. BTW, all were same price. Anyway, parking costed me $20 + $250 tow + $9 Uber, they only refunded the cost of the ride $9. Stay away from this guys!!! Also worth mentioning that took over a dozen emails to finally someone respond. | Excellent | The parking prices just went up again where I used to pay $11 to park it’s now $27 and this was just last week… price gauging is ridiculous now I have to find another job because I can’t pay $30 a day to go to work when that’s gone be giving out my whole check just to pay to park shame on yall…. And I will just delete your app cause shame on you | Check if your lot accepts this app | App very handy and easy to use. One suggestion. Sometimes reserved spots are not held in nyc so makes parking a bit unreliable. Not your fault but if there was a way to know , it would help. | I like using park whiz   Your app said if I booked today, I would get $15 off but the $15 savings didn’t get applied…   I’m disappointed | I made (and paid for) a reservation for a spot in a nearby city. I drove to the lot and the attendant wouldn’t let me in saying “it was only for the hotel this weekend.” I had to find a new spot while also calling to get a refund.

Very accurate. | Easy to use | Not sure I like it | Avenza has great topo maps and is a high quality app!!! | With G.P.S. tracking and so many features, Avenza is incredibly Awesome! | Awesome collection of Regional Maps! No excuse for setting at home when there’s a lot to see and explore in the WEST! | Love these maps for the detail, especially the hiking maps. | Everytime I try to purchase a map I get an “error” message that gives me no solution to fix this problem and nothing is on the website for it either. 

I am able to make in app purchases on other apps and have a balance on my iTunes. | Venezia is a great mapping tool | Clunky map search even with filters. Have to scroll through many maps | since last update the maps can't be used and the 'reload' has been stuck for several hours | Liar. Mug. | I had bought 7 garmin maps and now 4 of them I can’t access because they are no longer available. I would like them to work or get a refund for those 4 maps. The app works great otherwise. | I use the app when I stay in state parks around Tennessee and I love it! I’m able to see trail markers, set waypoints, and track my walks and bicycle rides. I truly believe it’s one of the best apps available for maps and mapping. | Fantastic map was on hike with my daughter and wondered where we were at. Stopped and loaded app. Located our position on trail and how to get back to start. Great map. | First, it's absolutely ludicrous that a for-profit company like this can become the ""official"" tool for the USFS MVUM with such a poor product.

Any time you get to a new location and want a new MVUM, expect to spend 5 - 10 minutes trying to find the map in the ""Store"". Often times it displays tons of unrelated maps that it wants to sell you. Even when you put ""mvum"" in the search field, it comes up with a bunch of junk results.

No idea how this has 5 stars. Why can't it just simply and easily load the maps I need? Or at least have a working search? | I began using Avenza several years ago while volunteering for a national forest. While out of a cell phone connection it connected and showed me where I was in the forest (satellite?). I advised hikers to download to keep from getting lost on multi day hikes. | I used it for a recent state park hunt and it was great tool. From planning to navigating, it was very helpful. | Tracks you on the map so if you get lost you can find your way back | Great detail and easy to use. | Where was this app 30 years ago! Awesome app. Easy to use! Thank you to all involved creating this. | Really impressed with the features and functionality of this app and the free access to topographic maps and the ability to track your location on the topos! | I work for a land management agency and frequently utilize Avenza to help track treatments of invasive species and during planning and implementation of prescribed fire. I also use it in similar fashion on my private property, and for private landowners with whom I’m working for with my other job (private sector). The two things I would love to see are real time GPS positioning of the entire burn team (individual members), and on a personal level - a GPS dog collar compatible with the app for real time positioning display as well. Love the app overall. | Good interface with Gazatter | This app is great for navigating MVUMs but it’s a pain that it doesn’t work with Apple CarPlay. Because it doesn’t I’m forced to use two navigation sources (phone w/ Avenza and CarPlay w/ Gaia GPS MVUMs) for accurate location and direction. 

Please update app to work with CarPlay. Pretty please. With a cherry on top. | It’s reliable and easy to use.  Easy to convert recorded tracks for use in ArcGIS applications. | Very easy to use and the detail of the map was spot on.  amazing having all the quality maps at your fingertips. | Probably the best free navigation app for those going off of cell service without a gps. It does require a level of familiarity with the area as mostly maps don’t have descriptions of trail/road difficulty but that is more a comment on the types of maps that are available than the app itself. Overall a good app that will only get better over time. | Have been using avenza for years for home and work. At work I have the paid pro which is great. At home on the free app the newest update has made it unusable for more than three maps. Have others in my device for reference and get pop ups to upgrade to pro every few seconds making the map unusable. Please fix | I download and try the app about once a year, get frustrated and delete it. | App is excellent for backcountry trips in areas of poor cell service. Interface is a little complicated and unclear. If there was an intuitive button to walk users through all the functions either when they first start using the app or before a trip after not using the app for months, that would be amazing. | Avenza Maps are super easy to use.  The maps show exactly where you are on the trail. The maps look just like the paper maps provided by the parks! I love Avenza Maps on trails that are not very well marked or have unofficial side trails. | The apps technology is so accurate. What a pleasure and time saver. Plus the best part is its user friendly. | I sign into the website with an email and a password, find what I want and then get a CTA to download my maps. This launches the app, but doesn’t download any maps and what I just purchased doesn’t show up in the app. The app account requires an email, and a username, and a password is optional, but I have just signed in to the website with an email and a password— no username. So do I make up a new username and hope they can link my account? Why username at all? | Love. Has been a valuable tool during hiking | I’m wondering around in here as a beginner and am finding it to be nice. As a wild land firefighter, it comes in handy to scope our work. | I’ve been using Avenza for years and it is user friendly and an all around great app! | Perfect | If you buy maps with your Apple account before you login, Avenza will not show the maps in your account so you won’t be able to download them again.

The instructions/documentation are terrible, terrible terrible. Also, it’s unclear to me whether the maps are downloaded to my device or not. 

Really surprised, given how highly rated it is. This isn’t rocket science. An app like this should be intuitive and seamless. | Of NO value much better apps with less gyrations and added purchases to maybe get current data. | I don’t know why I needed to sign up, download and pay for a free map. And it was a ridiculously long download. All for a map that is available on a pdf | Found this online while looking for sleeping giant park maps.  Tried it with an army friend while we were hiking and we were both pleasantly surprised by how user friendly and accurate this app is.  Highly recommended. | We really enjoy using Avanza very detailed, highly recommend it to any novice or avid experienced rider. Thank you.
The Poirier’s | As a wildland firefighter, I understand the importance of having accurate and up-to-date information at my fingertips. Avenza Maps has become an indispensable app in my firefighting toolkit. Its exceptional features and user-friendly interface make it an invaluable companion during intense wildfire incidents.

First and foremost, Avenza Maps excels in its ability to provide detailed, georeferenced maps that are essential for navigating and understanding the terrain. The app allows me to import and access topographic, satellite, and custom maps, ensuring that I have a comprehensive view of the fire area and surrounding landscapes. With just a few taps, I can quickly switch between maps to gain a clearer understanding of the fire's progression and potential hazards.

One of the standout features of Avenza Maps is its ability to track my location even in remote areas with limited or no cellular service. This offline functionality is a game-changer for wildland firefighting, as it enables me to maintain real-time situational awareness regardless of the connectivity conditions. The app's GPS integration ensures that I can accurately mark and navigate to critical waypoints, such as fire perimeters, evacuation routes, water sources, and safety zones.

Avenza Maps also provides valuable tools for annotation and collaboration. I can easily add notes, drawings, and measurements directly onto the maps, allowing me to communicate essential information to my team or incident commanders. This feature streamlines coordination efforts and enhances overall situational awareness among the firefighting personnel.

Furthermore, Avenza Maps' intuitive interface and smooth performance make it a pleasure to use, even during high-pressure situations. Navigating the app, zooming in and out, and switching between maps are all seamless experiences that contribute to its overall effectiveness in the field.

The developers behind Avenza Maps consistently update the app, ensuring it remains up to date with the latest technological advancements and addressing user feedback. The dedication to improving the app's functionality and stability is evident, making it a reliable and trustworthy tool for wildland firefighting operations.

In conclusion, Avenza Maps is a must-have app for wildland firefighters. Its ability to provide accurate georeferenced maps, offline functionality, annotation tools, and extensive map overlays makes it an indispensable tool for navigating and responding to wildfires. The app's user-friendly interface and regular updates further contribute to its excellence. I highly recommend Avenza Maps to all wildland firefighters looking to enhance their operational efficiency and situational awareness in the field.

Note: While Avenza Maps is an exceptional tool for wildland firefighting, always prioritize following official protocols, guidelines, and the advice of incident commanders during firefighting operations. | As soon as I started using this I decided this will be my first primary mapping app for public lands. Still impressive it takes a “printable” government map and can locate you on it. | OMG!  I would rate this even higher if possible! I tried this out in the Grayson Highlands this past week and it was spot on and tracked me even though my phone was in airplane mode! What a relief.

I highly recommend. | I seriously have never been so disappointed and mistreated by a hotel (citizenM - Downtown Los Angeles) as my partner and I were during our stay there. First off, at check-in the gentleman forgot to take or input a credit card for incidentals. Along with this, I asked if we could do a late check out just in case we had too much fun in DTLA. Unfortunately, he must’ve forgotten. He was really nice though. 

This morning, we were awakened by loud knocking and a request to leave immediately. We immediately called the front and reminded them of what we had asked for. We were told it was fine. But soon thereafter received a call again asking for us to go to the front immediately since there was no card on file. While I understand policies and such. As a superintendent of schools, I say “approach determines response” and I was fuming. In the end, as we were leaving, I asked an attendant for information on a manager. She shared that he was there and she would ask him over. She clearly went to get him. She came back with a gentleman who didn’t greet or anything but stood there. She shared for me to email instead. How distasteful and disrespectful. I feel that there should be something done. I am appalled. 

Hotel Tonight has always been great in customer service and I look forward to a resolution and response for this issue. CitizenM was a major disappointment. | I loved HotelTonight until I had to deal with their support team and will not be giving them business any longer.

I booked a hotel and the listing was inaccurate in regards to pet policy. I ended up booking a second reservation (same dates) through the app and reached out to support asking for a credit on the room where the listing was inaccurate. After spending over an hour on the phone and being escalated to a manager, I was told that they would not provide a credit against the $80 room. The manager continued insisting that the pet policy was on the listing, despite me sending multiple screenshots. The original agent acknowledged that the listing was incorrect.

Another example of a technology company getting larger and forgetting to take care of their long term customers. Absolutely one of the worst support experiences I’ve had in a long time. Beware. | I have been using this app for 11 years and it does not disappoint!!! It always has the best deals and I love the perks you get! Love it! | Best deals ever 
I always do research about hotels and they have good prices ❤️ | The property was very clean & hotel was extremely quite . I’d stay there often every time I’m in Columbus area . Staff is very kind | I booked through Hotel Tonight for one night business stay clean and simple, when I showed up at the hotel they said my reservation was not paid for and I would have to call hotel tonight to fix it. After a long hold and some aggravation, this was finally straightened out. But hey, you had one job, book, my hotel, and you failed. I will be deleting this app, and suggest you avoid at all costs. | This site told Me 1hr before my reservation that the hotel was full and they a moved me to some shady motel on the outside of town. The prices are actually no better using this site even if f too book last minute. avoid! | Most often this app has the best deals on great hotels | I am at level 15! And every level it misleads you to think you are getting additional discounts, when you definitely are not. I am going to sue for false advertisement. | I always use Hotel Tonight ! Easy to use and always has great deals. Only hotel app I use. | After making 2 reservations thru this sight, I discovered that it would cost me over 20-25% less to simply walk into the hotel and book a room. Using this web sight cost me more than retail. Last time I use it. | There has been multiple times I’ve tried to book a hotel for TONIGHT and the app changes the date to a month out. When this happens, customer service has no interest in helping to rectify the situation. You are screwed and they will just say the booking is non-refundable. BEWARE. | I love being able to stay at really nice hotels within my company’s budget! | Love this app for last minute travel! | I love Hotel Tonight deals and great services | Unexpected issues are a part of life.  Accordingly, the customer service reps have all provided excellent support!  Hotel Tonight
is always my “go to” when I am on the go ! | The best app that I have downloaded on my phone | I’ve used it several times in NYC. App is easy to use and the prices are competitive. In fact, last year I walked into the New Yorker Hotel and they couldn’t match the rate on the app, so I used it right there in the lobby. | I love this app, have been using for several years and am never disappointed with ease and options for available hotels + amenities. Thanks for making my life easier! | The best deals ever. I love this app and won’t book anywhere else! It just gets better and better! | Hotel is terrible, dirty, unvacuumed, rooms were fair-Toilet dirty. Front desk man was nice. | After making it to level 9, I have noticed that this app does not have the best prices. 
It’s a good app to see what options there are, but I suggest to reach out to hotel directly as you will often find better prices | I was charged twice for a room I booked. Both on hitel tonight and then when I checked in (the hotel told me no payment had come from hotel tonight) but I cannot get a hold of anyone to get a refund | So easy to make a booking on the road and on the move. Life saver of an app. Top favorite apps of mine | The wrong wrong, Hotel! | Lea muy bien antes de pagar me cobraron $127.00 más a parte lo que pagué del hotel $123 por noche. Pero es muy confuso porque cuando uno paga no te lo añade en el total y en el total dice no debe nada más extra que lo que está pagando por las noches del hotel 😞 | Hard to book a room for couple and child or children because everything is single bed in room only.  In search, could you allow for a filter to provide a two bed room? | Easy booking.. great price | As a former frequent Hotwire customer I’ve now switched to Hotel Tonight as I have found the star ratings more accurate, the hotels of better quality, and the service prompt and courteous. Highly recommended for busy travelers | My dear friend MM insisted I use this ap… she was (as always) absolutely right!

Use it! It’s a been a salvation | Use all the time when traveling. Great for finding deals on short notice or even on advance. | Works great. | I have 280 in credit. How do I apply it to a stay? | I spent one hour trying to book and room and I got stuck in an email loop.

No room booked!
Not happy!!!  I will not recommend this app again! | I love this app | Best | Mold in my bathroom - description photos clearly do not depict that.  They deleted my account after I left a review with photos.  A guy on the phone told me he can’t help me that I have to continue my conversation through email so the guy helping me through email is telling me that they offered me a credit and I’m trying to tell him I don’t even have an active account with you guys how is that proper compensation for my experience or lack there of? Seems like a janky company. Stay away | I’ve had help from the call center a few times recently and the issue handling was excellent. | Diana and Milly are the best! Very nice hotel! Beautifully decorated, great service and friendly staff! I’m an annual pass holder at Disney and this is my new “go to” hotel when visiting the Disney area! Love it!!! | Was forced to pay 30% more when I arrived at the hotel even though I had already paid the advertised price through HotelTonight. Unethical business practices. | I love hotels.com. They’ve always been super quick and easy to get a room for a decent rate and it has everything you need to make it quick and easy you can see your room, destination, location and ratings. This is the spot hotel.com is the bomb | Stayed 2 nights here. Thought it would be decent because says Wyndham. I guess it’s ok for single guy on a work layover. Room smelled of weed , multiple paint touchups never finished , holes in bathroom door frame, vinyl floors very dirty , front door never sealed properly letting air in, tv didn’t work , air conditioner worked but sounded like a diesel truck engine. It’s cheap but overpriced at 60 bucks even. | Been using hotel engineer since 2015. Level 16 in perks. Booked 49 nights this far. At 1% of all users. 

I’m moving on as the ux is just painful as it always re-centers you to your current location, can’t use map mode to search within area and then change the search. Also no filtering at all. I’d rather pay a few dollars more per night and have a ux that works in 2024. | Tarrible app and supper buggy with logging in ans password | Don’t use this app they don’t confirm the appointments with the people they don’t the rooms that they promote are what it is supposed to be. They put false advertisement on here you’re not getting what you pay for. They’re gonna end up putting you in a room that’s smaller that’s not suitable for what you have if you have a family, they don’t book the actual reservation so when you get there it’s not what it’s supposed to be I’m telling you don’t use this app I have $150 credit I’m not gonna use it | My wife and I have booked a top-class hotel downtown for a slice of the cost! The app has an impressive interface and a pleasing experience (I’m a web experience designer). I got very sick the first time I booked, and the customer service was phenomenal! HT has far exceeded my expectations and proven a delightful service to use! | I enjoyed the bed and very soft pillows. A few things: one little frig under the desk would be great. The shower curtain is not long enough so if you don’t turn just right the whole shower there is a lot of water that gets on the floor. Put Kleenex in the bathroom, I didn’t find the box til the very morning I left as I put my shoes on. Thank you | Call me. 616-292-1503 Why would your app find me a room that said downtown Indianapolis that is located 70 miles north. Also days in pictures posted there were not accurate Why is booking only one bed?

However, scientists discovered that there are lots of creatures that existed long before dinosaurs. One of those creatures is the grasshopper. The fossil record shows that these insects first appeared more than 300 million years ago.

I’ve never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a taxi and I’ve even ordered things like fried chicken and French fries which weren’t soggy. The food is piping hot. Keep it up | Great experience, driver super helpful. | Good service and very friendly driver. | They use deceptive tactics to get you to use their Wallet app so they can capitalize off of you. It looks like worst customer service, which is not existent. They share your personal phone and information with the drivers so that you could be harassed. | No problem with the ride. Thank you | Sometimes it is unclear where the exact pick up point is and if you don’t make it there in time, they cancel on you but still charge you. | No place to submit a complaint. Allows drivers one has just canceled to AGAIN accept a requested ride! Should prohibit a ride that has been canceled from accepting the same ride from the same person! No obvious way to get a refund. | Exceptional great and kind person! Hope ride again to this guy in the future. | This is my first time in SG and Grab app.The driver really help me to get correct ride even have to pay sur plus charge  ,I am Okay .Thanks | Good & friendly driver 👍🫡👏 | Tốt | Good | This bug has existed for years now. 

When I cancel an order, the promo is consumed despite not buying anything. This is a wasted opportunity for both Grab and the customer to have a business transaction. | The app is not reliable at all, you can place an order for food delivery, and wait for hours without any support and no one to contact. There is no way to check on your order or even the status, the time of the order will keep extending without you knowing what’s happening. | Courteous and engaging driver | For Singapore users, I recommend Grab over Deliveroo for food delivery. Here’s bad experience I had with Deliveroo. On April 1st, 2024, I ordered from Sushi Tei via Deliveroo, scheduled between 7:00 PM and 7:30 PM. Despite the app indicating that the driver was near at 7:30 PM, the order was erroneously marked as ""delivered"" at 7:40 PM, with neither the food nor the driver appearing. I immediately contacted Deliveroo’s customer support where the agent, Jose, claimed the driver attempted contact and left the food in the lobby, both of which were untrue. No evidence of these attempts was presented despite my requests. After spending over 20 minutes waiting in the lobby and receiving no satisfactory resolution, the options given were a refund or a re-delivery after an additional 90 minutes, both of which I found unacceptable. Following this frustrating experience, I reached out again to customer service to express my concerns. Sadly, it took two weeks for a response, only to be told that compensation would be limited to just the initial amount of the order. This lack of adequate resolution and the slow response time only added to my disappointment. This entire ordeal has significantly diminished my trust in Deliveroo’s service and reliability, especially when working late. The apparent dishonesty of the driver, coupled with the lackluster response from customer support, reflects poorly on Deliveroo’s commitment to customer satisfaction. I am now hesitant to use their service in the future, given the risk of experiencing similar issues again. | You are the best!! I was hesitant but I give you a try and the best will be using you my entire stay here and in the future when I move to bali | Don’t use dog grab app service so bad after month I take a taxi lost phone in the car The driver hasn't been contacted yet. I'm telling the truth. | Was working great.

Now the menu will not display in English.

Yes, I have my preferred language set up correctly. 

Yes, I have restarted the app and updated everything.

I wish it would work like it used to. | Works great | Good service | Driver called me and asked me to cancel I refused I don’t want to pay cancellation fees thank he complete the ride and I was charged I sant a massage to the app never received any refund 
Or reply will not use this app ever again | Easy to use and reliable | The app now reassigns you to cars further and further away until you give up and book a Premium as it then becomes the only way to get anywhere. What an incredible rip off and glad their share price is in the toilet with these kind of tactics. | She drove wrong directions and drop is off in wrong places 
Very bad service and attitude | Dịch vụ tốt | I have enjoyed this ride | I was disappointed with the waiting charge and driver my canceling our ride. We are all patiently waiting at Designated pick up point. At least courtesy call or text first before canceling our ride. My son got  terrible headache and needed to go back to hotel right away . | Safe and had a helmet for me | Very anti competitive. I ordered a taxi with Grab and they took 12 mins to arrive. Tada (better) found one for 3 mins away, but Grab wanted to charge $4 to cancel. Slow and expensive | You cannot find how to search for items, almost impossible to tip a driver after you place the order if you want to search for something besides fast food. Good luck because it’s almost impossible. | Order with estimated delivery of 20 minutes.

After ordering, it shows 30 minutes estimated arrival time.

After 50 minutes, food is still at the restaurant showing no drivers found.

The app does not allow cancel within the app and asks us to call the them to cancel. We called but just gets put on hold.

After 20 minutes of waiting on phone, we gave up and drove down to the store ourselves.

It turns out the store had the food ready 20 minutes after our order but no driver ever showed up.

The store called Grab to cancel and charged us directly instead.

If Grab does not have drivers on the road, they should not allow customers to order and waste everyones time. | The address that use to deliver on your app, took the driver go to wrong location!!! I think not only me have this problem. You should have an option to find the Resturant that near to your location  on the map in your app. | Best experience with this driver | 这个软件有时候显示的价格、比出租车贵好几倍。注意对比。 | I was trying to schedule a grab to pick me up at a later time, but the instant I book it, a driver shows up, and I’m not even ready. | I did not receive my order but was charged. | Effective.  Efficient.  Timely.  Clean.  Courteous. | Currently in HCMC, VN and Grab is awesome! Pickups have always been within minutes and cheap! Excellent service, professional drivers, and great communication. Grab has made my experience in the city the best. As a foreigner, thank you!! TEN stars if I could!!! | Thanks for being so awesome! Really appreciate it. Sorry I don’t rate the drivers as much as I should. They’ve all been fantastic. I’ll do better giving thumbs up and online praise. | Fast service and very reliable service and apps. Very affordable price | Easier to use than Uber | Thank you so much for helping me get my bag back in the car | Considering all other apps for food, transport etc, grab is the worst one of them. Poor service, terrible drivers with attitude and no respect whatsoever | I paid extra for prioritized delivery, yet it took even longer than normal (45 minutes) and the app kept the money! Same thing with combined delivery: they combine multiple orders but the delivery fee is the same. Bloodsucker. | I am very disappointed with Grab's recent changes to their fee structure. Previously, Grab did not charge any fees for foreign card transactions. However, they have now introduced a 4% fee for such transactions. In addition, they have raised other fees as well. As a result, the total fees I am paying now are twice as high as before. This is a frustrating development for me as a customer. | 2nd Complaint: After confirming that the restaurant had food prepared for more almost an hour, Grab Help Centre confirmed that they had yet to find a rider to deliver!  Why accept the order if a rider could not be found?

1st Complaint: Driver never came; driver cancelled; then Grab wanted to charge a waiting fee! A Temasek invested company should have integrity and not cheat consumers. | Clean and spacious car | Driver very friendly and informative!! Thanks for a fun ride!! | Làm cái app dở ẹc, tàii xế gọi qua app không bao giờ nghe đc, tưởng đt mình hư hoá ra hỏi ai cũng bị.

Bazarınız bağlanır deyə bele dələduzluqlara ehtiyac toxdur. | My first attempt using the app was terrible. I waited for 15 minutes pass the time with kids in cold weather and did not get to use the service. The support staff told me the driver waited for me and attempted to contact me. In my app I have no record of that. I was charged cancellation fee but the customer support only supported the driver but did not listen to the customer. If there was a miscommunication, and if the driver did wait(as I trust), at least they waited in a warm car. Plus There was no attempt to communicate with me(I sent the time and screenshot to Customer support and got closed the case). It is not a huge amount but it shows how the business treats customers. Uber is way more user centric in similar situations. | This is how it works: call a bolt, wait for 20 mins, then get an antique, dirty car with an unshaven, smelly, smoking, bad tempered driver who aimlessly drives around the whole town, making a 10-minute ride last for half an hour and cost 5 times as much as it should... Perfect if you are a masochist, I suppose. Otherwise, don't use it!!! | The app doesn't send verification code (in Tbilisi) but the website works. So people are stuck out of their account in the application! | Mispredicts arrival times causing tardiness to appointments and meetings | It keeps saying I will get an SMS but it never comes - phone number is correct - deleting the app since I can’t get into it. | تلاقي صورة السائق شخص سعودي وبعدين يجيك واحد من جنسية مختلفة، واذا انك غير محظوظ بيجيك كمان بسيارة مختلفة.. وقدمت شكوى ٣ مرات وما تواصل معي احد او اهتم بالأمر . | Very convenient to go wherever. | I was in Porto for a few days and tried Bolt. Friendly capable drivers and very reasonable rates. I was glad I gave it a try! | My hometown is a very small city and first time I have the possibility to take a taxi with a professional brand that I trust | The rate of cancellations and other weird unexpected behaviours with drivers using this app is disappointing. Imagine 6-7 drivers not picking up an airport pickup. Then the confirmed driver cancelling 1 minute before arriving. All of that leading me to skip two public transit options. Or a driver whose car you hop into only to be told that the engine stopped working. It seems to me that the incentive system for drivers doesn't align with the driver or rider needs. | It’s ridiculous that Bolt has a pet option. 
The drivers come and then cancel because you have a pet? What? 
These drivers should either be penalized for such behavior or Bolt should remove the pet option. | I have called taxi in different countries and everywhere half of the drivers are scammers. It's a terrible app. Any competitor is better than Bolt | I was trying to park scooter in a parking zone. Unfortunately application is that dumb, that even in parking zone it said that I need to park it parking zone. So I wasted couple minutes while searching those inches where it will be correct position. Wasted money, wasted time. Bolt services is getting worst and worst. “Thank you!” | Moved my payment to my cc in Bangkok as no drivers ever had change. Thinking this was better I didn’t more than 30 minutes trying to book a 1.4 mile ride in a taxi or car. Every time they billed me and the driver canceled 10 straight times. They need to spend more time getting me a car and less billing my card. My credit card statement will look ridiculous. Secure the ride, complete the ride and then bill. I ended up finding a tuk tuk on the street as no cars were available. | Every time I order for a bolt it tells me an amount and tells the driver another amount like if it tells me 12,000 it will tell the driver 16,000 | Ви що офігіли просити документи? | Je trouve Bolt très efficace | Great options and great price | Took a bolt taxi which dropped me off in the completely incorrect location and then told me I need to walk up a hill for no good reason. Spoke with FIVE different people through bolt customer service to complain and not one would refund me which I requested on principle. Never again. | Yes | I’ve tried numerous times to add my Amex card. The app says it’s texting me a code, but it never arrives. It doesn’t go to spam. No answers on Google. I’ve tried for 2 weeks. Guess I can’t use it for our trip to Portugal. | Bolt this apps it’s so good so far I used it. All the driver were excellent, car were all really new and clean. 

So far I realize only that we might need to wait a little longer than other apps, but maybe because it’s still new… I just hope there will be more supplier of car provide in my near future visit. 

Sincerely saying must use this apps if you are traveling around Bangkok… | Often times the driver takes “the long route” to increase your charges. He decorated from the Bolt mapped route then your rate that you agreed to is significantly higher without your knowledge. When you try to contact Bolt Customer Service, they won’t respond. I’ve been waiting over a week for any response. Watch out, Bolt is a SCAM. | Personal info bölmesi açilmiyor.Donuyor.Bug reportu nereye yazacagimi bilemedim :)
Environment:ios 17.4.1 | The drivers always just cancel over and over the bolt app will try and upsel you to pay another €25 for a faster pickup. U would pay all in €25 with heetch. I have tried between heetch Uber and bolt. Bolt is worse than Uber because at least Uber is reliable. Never using bolt again deleting the app as soon as my driver picks us up(if he ever shows) -5 stars out of 5 if I could . | In two separate occasions I have Bolt drivers say they are at my requested pick up location but not true! They only wait 2 minutes and then charge you a cancellation fee!!!! Total joke. The drivers expect you to go to where they feel like waiting even if you are not familiar with the city or was the requested pick up location you wrote! | Azerbaijan GM needs to be fired. Ordered a Bolt after landing in Baku, driver shows up in beat up car with no seatbelts, drives for bit, stops and cancels the ride just after leaving the airport, then demands $30 for me to take my luggage (actual fair was $5). 

Bolt support totally useless - they give me an equivalent of $2 credit for my next ride and say they’ll “talk to the driver”. 

Use Uber | Жахливий додаток і ще гірший сервіс. Максимально неадекватні водії, брудні авто, шахрайство з грошима і повністю відсутнє відчуття безпеки під час поїздки/ використання додатку. Завжди десь відбудеться « випадкова помилка» і вам спише більше коштів. Служба підтримки не те, що погана. Вона найгірша зі всіх, які я використовувала. | I really recommend this driver. | I downloaded bolt for the first time with a 70% of coupon for the first ride and the coupon code wasn’t applied to my ride. Tried to get customer support to honor it but got the run around from 4 different agents - one said the code didn’t work because of “irregular activities”, the second made me re-verify  my identity, the 3rd said the code could not applied after the ride and repeated “irregular activities” as the reason and then refused to respond when I asked what that meant.
Don’t trust their coupons or their very poor customer service | Usamos Bolt con muchos tiempo de espera, coches que iban en dirección contraria a la de recogida, anulaciones por llevar maletas a pesar de pedir XL… | Pascou was amazing!  He told me all about Lisboa and Cascais. He was helpful with my Portuguese too!  Please send me a message on how I can tip him!  Thank you! | Had multiple problems with this app not giving the driver the correct address. And the drivers add wait times due to me confirming that the address they had was correct. Uber is much better. | I’m not disappointed at all! When I get a Bolt, nobody cancels the order, and they always get you there quick, even with traffic! It’s definitely a great option. | App just crashes on launch | the app wont even send me a confirmation code to get logged into the app so i cant even use it to begin with | A wait that says it’s four minutes will be 16. Impossible to get drivers. So much worse than Uber it’s crazy | Bolt rides are an essential alternative mode of transportation in Asia. Great when you need to travel distances or would like air conditioning. Most drivers speak English in some way and many are very helpful with local tips and advice.. Shows you how far the driver is from you before picking up and the route along the way. Similar to Uber but with the nice feature to pay cash at the end of your ride. App is very user friendly. | Samir is very patient and safe driver | Experience: Needed to commute to work, located an hour away. Issue: Encountered a major hurdle with Bolt’s payment system - my debit card, despite multiple verifications with the bank, was consistently declined. Bolt’s system is apparently at fault. Customer Service Response: Lacking effectiveness. Now, there’s an additional 48-hour wait just to attempt adding a card again. Overall Assessment: Bolt’s failure in a basic service aspect - processing a payment - is more than just a personal inconvenience; it’s a glaring flaw in their system. This incident isn’t just about being stranded without a ride; it reflects poorly on Bolt’s reliability and customer service quality. Impact on Bolt’s Reputation and Business: Such experiences can severely damage Bolt’s reputation. In the competitive ride-sharing market, reliability and ease of use are crucial. Issues like these drive customers away, potentially to competitors. Every frustrated customer like me represents not just a lost ride but a loss of trust in Bolt’s ability to deliver a basic service. Moreover, word of mouth and online reviews magnify the impact of negative experiences, further eroding the company’s standing in the eyes of potential customers. Bolt needs to urgently address these issues to retain its user base and uphold its market position. | Это лучшая компания в Тбилиси.  
Надёжно безопасные и комфортно! | I’d love to try this app out, but I can’t even get past the SMS auth code. Never receive it, no matter how many times I resend it. 🤷🏼‍♂️ | Nice driver | The SMS verification text not coming through… | In europe, this tends to be cheaper and more common then the competitors. but, it won’t even send me a code to SMS! i’ve tried several times, even selected for a call back instead of nothing, alas, still nothing! i tried deleting and reinstalling the app, retyping my phone number, but still, no code. how am i supposed to even order a ride if i can’t get past the login page?? | Amazing greatt app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | It is better to have Chinese operation and send photos. | I was unable to get across the street the meet my driver, I had set my location to my airbnb which it has been set at for days with no issues prior with pick up. I am disabled and was unable to walk across a busy road full of buses and moving cars to meet this driver, as it was unsafe and would have started the money costing wait timer. So I tried to wave the driver down with my hands but they did not notice me. I canceled my ride as I was unable to take it, and took the same exact ride a few moments later with a driver that went to the correct pick up location. I contacted support 2 times and they keep saying the driver was at the correct pickup location and would not be refunding me, I am disputing this transaction with my bank. | I attempted to register with my U.S. phone number but I couldn’t receive a text or call back to register.

Very creative choices!  Very funny choices!  BUT there are grammatical word use/spelling errors, especially in the Adult version that bothered me (I am a retired teacher, w degree in English). Errors include missing words, use of ""you"" instead of ""your"", and use of ""your"" instead of ""you're"" (contraction for ""you are"") Have at least two people proof read/edit, since this game depends on language clarity.  Good luck! And, I really did enjoy the game.  Do you have or wil you be making a kid's version?

Learning 5 words a day for beginners is great! | Honestly such a great app and the pronunciation is amazing although the words are all over the place so don’t expect like a Duolingo style lesson 

I couldn’t love it more tho 

Daalu drops !! | I’m currently learning Igbo on Drops and it’s been very helpful especially because there are not many resources out there’s to help me learn igbo. The stuff I’m learning is good and useful, but I do wish that there was more English translating in Drops. This is because I often find myself forgetting what some Igbo words or phrases mean because I don’t remember what they mean in English. | I love this app it’s so easy to use and helps you to understand Arabic better | This is a great platform to learn another language because it’s fun, and feels doable. | Okay so this is a good language learning app, but when I go do my lesson for the day it will say that I have to wait 20 hours until I get to do my lesson. On top of that, I can’t change how long each session is unless I get Drops+. | It is enjoyable learning and fun. When it congratulates you I think it should stop the timer. It is also nice to learn about the language’s culture. 5. Minutes a day is nice because it helps you learn the words instead of knowing a few and forgetting the rest because you have so many words. I would suggest putting 2 more lessons on to a topic the app says you mastered or use review dojo. | great supplemental tool for your vocabulary. Could have better review options, but other than that worth every penny. | I have a streak of over a year in this app, and until recently I thought it was fantastic. A few months ago, though, they introduced a glitch where if you complete a module before your 5 minutes are up, it usually takes you back to the start screen and sets your time back to zero. This means that you have to start your five minutes over if you want to keep your streak in the app. This has turned it into a lie when the app claims it only takes five minutes a day — it’s closer to ten minutes if you are actually making progress.

They’ve released a few updates since this started happening, but none correct the problem. The very poor maintenance of this app and the fact that they’re allowing it to be this buggy drove me to write this review. I have no problem paying for apps, but when I do, I expect them to work on the most basic level. This one doesn’t. | I like this so much. Very interactive and fun. | its so helpful and i just dowloaded and learned la fiesta sunglasses la perro  and hola gracias and more! | Great tool for learning. | Its very helpful even tho it’s my first time trying out this app, I hope to learn and understand Thai better in order to enjoy my Thai drama series without having to read subtitles | I love visual learning and it’s the best for me. It’s a lot easier learning on here then any other language app. | Never been more fun! | pretty fire | Started putting together simple sentences day one | it’s very helpful for multiple things I love the fact that I learn new words and review the old ones it really helps me master them | I love this app it’s really good to learn languages and u get a 7 day trail!!!m how cool is that? Download it right nowwwwwww | I really love this application it focuses great on memory and vocabulary. | I’ve had this app for years and used it on and off the whole time, but I’ve only started using it seriously within the last few months. First thing out of the way: unless you’re a genius, you will not become fluent in your target language using this app alone. That said, though, it’s excellent for vocabulary practice, which is one of the parts of language learning I struggle with the most. The free version (which I use) has a lot of options and even allows you some choice in what you study, which I really appreciate. | Namaste ji! I love the interface and formatting. The lessons are super cool and easy to navigate through. I’m a visual learner, so this approach works well for me. I get addicted to “playing” Drops because the design is so eye-pleasing and smooth. Yet, there are some blaring content and functional flaws I need to mention. This app is my absolute favorite (out of many that I’ve tried) mostly because of the exceptional visual interface and keen navigation. I am using Drops, along with Nemo and private Hindi lessons with a Native speaker in India. I also ask my Hindi speaking Indian friends when I have questions. So, I have a bit of insight and suggestions I hope the developers will take seriously. A big disappointment about words that are the same in English and Hindi. Granted, many words don’t have a translation (or it’s old school translation) and that’s completely understandable. Yet, as much as I love the visual learning app, with Drops for Hindi I find way too many words are in English (and obviously don’t have Hindi translations). I paid for the FULL app for HINDI words, not common English words pronounced with a Hindi accent! And in that case, as I’ve been taught elsewhere, you’d want to use the proper English accent to pronounce the English words anyway. So why bother putting it in there? Why say the word “salmon” and pronounce it with a Hindi accent? It’s not a Hindi word and it’s derived from the American language. Same with “broccoli” and a bunch of other foods, objects and situations. Why put English words in the Hindi vocabulary list at all? There are way too many words like this in the entire Drops for Hindi vocabulary section, which feels like a real rip off! If it isn’t a Hindi word, don’t put it in the vocabulary as a Hindi word! This is Hindi class, not English for Hindi speakers! Suggestion: Implement a “common words” section and don’t put them in the official Hindi vocabulary list. There’s no way to adjust the length of time to see the answers. After you’ve guessed at an answer, the solution pops up in less than a half second and it vanishes! As a beginner, I’d like to READ the answer and look at its spelling BEFORE going on to the next word or phrase. Suggestion: Please add a speed indicator and voice control, or maybe a pause-rewind-forward button. Look at Nemo for Hindi (yes, also using this) and you will see the ability to refine and control pace and voice. Some of the phrases are so long, the app moves onto the next word while the last one is still playing. They overlap. Then you have to replay the word/phrase all over again, meanwhile you don’t hear the entire sentence from the previous question. Then that learning moment lost forever. Frustrating! Suggestion: Again, add a controller for time between phrases or words. Maybe on screen or as a preference. See Nemo for Hindi. Pronunciation is questionable. As mentioned earlier, I am taking one-on-one Hindi classes from a Native speaker in India, in conjunction with Drops and other apps. It appears regularly the Roman spelling is incorrect or the pronunciation is way off. I know there’s variations but at least have the pronunciation MATCH the Roman spelling. Confusing! Suggestion: Include an alternative spellings list and matching proper pronunciation. Pronunciation is the most vital part of language! Many illustrations are baffling. I do report them as I come across issues and make suggestions for a better representation. My suggestions go into the ethers and I’m never sure any of them are applied. I’m guessing some images seem awkward because of culture gaps and lack of something translating properly. Not everything can be translated directly. That’s it for now. I’m still learning and have loads of questions. I’ll keep using Drops and bypass words and phrases that are redundant and/or not matching the pronunciation accurately (Accor to Drops spelling and pronunciation). I mostly have to giggle at odd illustrations! Dhanyavaad ji! | Team, I really enjoy morning drop sessions especially when I have a planned country visit. 

One of your older versions allowed users to continue to a different topic when they felt comfortable. The new versions sends me into different subjects quickly. I like to concrete my lessons and move on after. 

1.) Can there be an added portion in settings for users to preference.? | Give it a try I’m at my nah sound weird but it’s from a laugenge | Excelente | Resource to language learning. You will increase your vocabulary vault. Overall fun app and very affordable.🙃 | This app is great for expanding your vocabulary, but it might create a false sense of mastery. I find it complements tutoring well, aiding in vocabulary acquisition while leaving grammar to be addressed separately. Overall, it's a valuable tool. | So far so great! | This app is very helpful for vocab (I’m learning Tagalog) but less so for grammar. Would definitely recommend as a supplement to other resources! | So far so good. The repetition really helps. The pictures create memories with the words. Good app for beginners. | Superb | so useful and I learned sm in only one lessson! Can’t wait to learn more | A simple fun start | Keeps resetting my streak for no reason. Needs more new categories, not just switching them around and giving new names. | Love it | Thanks a lot. So useful app. I got a lot of benefits | It was very exciting | Goog | I know now how to speak and spell in English | love it | This is an easy and quick way to learn vocabulary, and can easily fit into anyone’s schedule who can spare 5 minutes. | Drops is a great App to learn a difficult language like Hebrew. It combines visual, audible, and a clever way to write words you have learned. I enjoy learning with Drops everyday! Waiting to get into grammar and sentences … hopefully soon | I like it because it makes and I love it because I know I’m very British | Big | This app is really good because you can learn Hawaiian and all different kind of languages. It can improvise your pronunciation with out a hard teacher | This app is nice for an eleven year old kid tryna learn a new language | Sometimes it decides to just reset my timer or switch topics without asking if not BOTH, it used to at least ask if I wanted to switch or move on, but now it just pops ups with a purple blob and decides to switch by itself—I have a subscription so it’s not even the free version acting up and I’ve tried contacting customer service yet nothing improves. | I’m loving the app for learning Cantonese! Literally no other app ( like Duolingo) has Cantonese on it. I would love for the app to explain the numbers beside the words when learning though ( assuming they deal with the tones) but I am unsure what the tones are for Cantonese. Otherwise I’m loving it! | Very helpful to visual learners | I have been paying for premium for sometime yet only getting the free level service. I have tried to fix this issue on my own to no avail. 

This is frustrating because it is taking up time that I could be using for language study. I only have a small amount of time to study, which is why I want to use the app to help maximize that time.

It’s so easy to make modifications to your trip. | I travelled to Miami on 4/18 from Tampa and from Miami to Tampa on 4/21. The coach from Tampa to Miami was not clean and lot of food waste, soft drink bottles and felt the coach was dirty. It would be advisable that before you let the passengers board clean it properly. 
Also it would be nice that Amtrak assigns seat numbers as you book.
I wouldn’t mind if you charge extra for window seats.
The staff are doing an excellent job and they are very friendly.
Thank you. | Opening Amtrak app stops music. | App is fine; works and easy to navigate.  A challenge to use with an iPad on landscape as it sometimes requires portrait use.   Seems like a simple fix (to a non-technical user at least) | The Amtrak app is generally good  with a few snags on more complicated itineraries. I enjoy riding Amtrak which has access to Yosemite National Park with bus connections.The trains are comfortable and the conductors warn you when your stop is approaching. The fares in California are pretty good and I like the flex fare- for just a couple dollars more, your ticket becomes changeable and refundable.Amtrak wants you to arrive safely and comfortably. | Even though I use the app to get easy access to Amtrak. The payments go through and I get no rewards for it. Even though they say every 1$ spent 1point awarded I have so far not received a single point for the entirety of the usage of this app. 

Just absolute trash treatment in terms of rewards. | Train is the best mode of transportation; Amtrack makes you feel luxurious | Generally works well and easy to use. Occasionally there are bugs (like with the trip date setting, where it gets stuck) but they seem to get fixed over time. Wish it tied more directly to my Rewards account. | While the app itself is not bad, Amtrack’s overall computer reservation system isn’t great. I just finished a 10 segment 30 day rail pass - an excellent value and quite flexible, definitely recommend - but I needed to change my schedule several times (hence why the pass). Every time but one I had to either call or live chat to do it because the system would just say “an error occurred in our system, please try again.” If the error message had told me the problem, I could have fixed it myself. Mostly this was because only so many seats are available to pass holders so I was hesitant to cancel one before knowing I could make the change, no way to do that without talking/chatting with an agent. I will say all but one of my interactions with agents were great, just a slower process than necessary. | This app is only for personal use, only if don’t have children travelling with you | Took too many tries to enter reservation with confused zeros and. Oooos | I am so grateful for the Amtrak app because I have had to book numerous trips of late and it has made it so easy to plan. Although my travel points are many, yet, it’s nice to see them accumulate in real time.

My only complaint is I wish the delay announcements would post in the app sooner. Not unless the delay is due to my phone’s network coverage. Anyway, thank you! | The coupons cannot be applied, meal selection for the roomette not available , no customer service . Very disappointing | Cannot get a keyboard on the sign in page. Need to fix the glitch! | I am using an iPhone and I have noticed that the app crashes pretty frequently. When I try to access the app it’s basically blank except for the command strip at the bottom (home, book, status, account , more) and when you tap any of them there’s no response. I end up having to restart the phone. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times but it still happens several times a week. | Glitchy; impossible to use. | You shouldn’t have to log in and log out to use basic functions- glitchy - prone  to crashing - its 2024 - while you are it put USB ports and beefed up wifi - be tech user friendly = more downloads + more users | Why does the app for train tickets need to take over the phone audio? | Keeps track of my trips. | Tried to make a purchase 3 times. Marks error, but used up gift card | Forget The Plane….Ride on the Train…!!! | Although Amtrak has improved the app over time, this app still has some major problems. 10-ride tickets almost never show the correct number of rides remaining, even days later. I have 2 rides remaining and my app shows 6. I've also been asked on a train to pay twice because this app also doesn't accurately show conductors when 10-ride tickets have been scanned. Website discounts also don't work in the app, forcing me to buy a ticket on the Amtrak website and then use the app to board a train. Finally, the app constantly freezes after going away from the app and then returning. | In the month since the last time I opened the amtrak app, it has started to stop playback of music on the device when the app is launched. This makes it entirely unusable for me. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS APP TO HIJACK MY AUDIO PLAYBACK. MAKE IT STOP. | Everyone that I have had contact with at the Station in Salem, OR has been wonderful. I have been using the train to get home from work for a month now because of an injury I am unable to drive. Everyone and I mean everyone is courteous and caring. I am using a knee scooter and they always help with boarding and de-boarding. 
The station is Salem could not be cleaner. The attendant is constantly cleaning. She is friendly and kind and works hard. I believe that it is the cleanest public restroom I have ever used. 
Security keeps the area safe as that station is in an area with many homeless people but they keep everything safe and clear. 
I could not be more impressed with the Amtrak services at the Salem, Oregon station. Thank tou so much and keep up the great work. 

Sincerely, 
Michael Williams
(Regular on 508 from Salem, OR to Oregon City) | Senior citizen sections do not have garbage bins... no water and food available. 
Food cart is located in the upper section of the train. 
I think there should be personnel from the food cart taking orders from menus that are available in the senior citizen sections. | When you hit home you will lose your upcoming ticket. Website says go to my transaction but it is nowhere to be found. Good thing I took screenshot of the ticket. Poor app. | I have tried several times to reserve a trip on line that would include a roommette on 1 leg of our round trip. I get as far as processing the payment and it comes back with accommodation is no longer available. After several attempts and even changing our travel dates, I called Amtrak directly. The lady was absolutely no help because she kept repeating that she knows nothing about the online booking process. She could not process my reservation because her system showed the accommodation was in someone’s cart already. It was definitely not in my cart. This has been a very frustrating and time consuming effort. | Easy to do on line for this senior!!!! | Train travel is new for me. I love traveling on Amtrak it is clean, comfortable, safe and easy to navigate at the stations as well as the web site. | I love to travel by Amtrak… I | This app takes several tries to accomplish any transaction.  Ultimately taking a phone call to solve but, only after a 30 minute wait. | Will show different times on different screens.
Doesn’t show track info - like other transportation apps. Terrible. | I enjoy booking with Amtrak to travel. Easy to book and board everything. | Fix the payment errors. Apple Pay isn’t working right now and PayPal sometimes fails. | Old and clunky app. Was trying to find info on arrival time. Based on the app I sensed there was nothing but an ineffective bot to communicate with | It does most of what you need while missing some other obvious features. For any special/nonstandard booking situations a phone operator is more helpful than the app but apparently incurs and upcharge for the service… | App is cumbersome and not as intuitive as it could be. | Sometimes the app can error out when purchasing tickets, resulting in several sessions until the purchase is actually verified. This aside, the app works well. | Cs is pretty poor and unwilling to help me move reservation | The app constantly lists different prices for the same ticket, spanning hundreds of dollars difference from minute to minute. It says it is processing a payment, only to get to the very last step and say that something went wrong and you need to try again. You are constantly caught in an endless loop of app malfunction. I’ve wasted HOURS trying to book various tickets after hours, and the automated phone system is no better!! | This app periodically will show a certain ticket price when you go to book trains, but then will not allow you to check out at that listed price, it will tell you your ticket is no longer available. When you go back to book the ticket for the same time slot, you will find that your ticket price has risen ~$20. Pretty scummy app design / horrible user experience. | The app is just okay for finding trains but it won’t let me buy a ticket. This has happened twice now, where I go through all the steps and check all the boxes and the ‘purchase’ button turns green. I press it and wait and try again and  …. nothing happens. Have removed app and reinstalled. Same problem and so I have to use my computer and a browser. Like I said, my last 2 train trips and the app won’t work to buy tickets. I’ve got an iPhone 14 and the latest everything. | I can't find anywhere in app to sign up for trip alerts.  Like the 3 hr delay today!   App says delayed. Nothing more. I received no notifications.  And app still shows original time for departure.
If someone sitting with me didn't tell me corrent updates I wouldn't even know. | Amtrak is my favorite mode of transportation | Can’t find my round trip tomorrow on this app and there appears no way to add it. | This message pops up every time o try to use the app. Pretty annoying. | Need to have text ability for ticket restorations.

And now it works much better offline, so once you have a schedule loaded and ticket activated, you’re set! | Very rude employee on train- I asked him to explain why the additional cost was so much higher- he would not do this; he kept repeating that I could take it up withcustomer service at Grand Central. I had a round trip ticket/ non peak& was riding during peak. Isn’t the cost peak price minus half of non peak ticket price? He said I owed him the full peak price-and not nicely-  a little kindness goes a long way. | The problem I am having is I can only get single instead of returns. I have to pay twice!! | Please bring back the old version. This new one isn’t working and it’s slow. | This is by far the best government app I have ever had the joy of using. So thoughtful and well designed. More transit agencies need to copy this. Would be cool if you could just fold the terrible NJ PATH and CTrail apps into this one app for a comprehensive Tri-State Area commuter rail experience. | It works well and reliably so

Very well designed for both finding the best train and paying with Apple Pay | I am glad I can count on trains to
Make it to very far work, but it’s a whole budget. They could and SHOULD have special Tates for daily
Commuters!!!! | When purchasing on debit card you will receive the notification that transaction was approved yet you still don’t receive a ticket to show conductor. Your better off buying a monthly which is what I will be doing. | Fast & convenient when boarding on the fly. 
I’ve caught many trains because of it.

Just make sure all your info is updated in the system.

& why am I limited to three phones per lifetime? Or is that MNR. | Kudos to the devs. MTA is super convenient now. I’m a big fan | The recent upgrade makes it much more difficult to look up specific subway lines to see all their stops. Prior to this current upgrade it was great. Not sure why the drastic change. | Love the convenience of this app! | This app makes it easy to find the train that gets you where you want to go when you want to get there! And once you’ve found your train, the app makes it easy to buy your ticket! Frictionless! The UI is responsive and modern. I don’t have any complaints. The dev team nailed it with this app. | The app has just decided to not take my FSA card I’ve been using for years since the last update. FIX PLEASE! | MTA got it right with TrainTime. Lots of info, easy to use. It works amazingly. Wish the tix prices could go down! At least the app works great. | This new update is a problem. I loved the old version, please bring it back. The new update is so bad and so glitchy. No clue how to use it the program is not user-face friendly at all. Big issues. | The MTA has gone through multiple apps through the years and this is their best one by far. This is the only official MTA app that is actually easy to use, and it makes traveling so much easier and less stressful. I’ve recommended the app to some of my non-transit- and tech-savvy friends and family and everyone has been able to navigate easily and seamlessly. Hopefully we’ll see an app of this quality for the rest of the MTA network soon! | So easy to use! | App is nice to purchase a ticket but it would be more helpful if it told people what was going on when the train is held or delayed. This way people would know should we wait here, go home, drive to work, or drive to another station. | Sometimes the schedule is not accurate, but it’s good enough for schedule checking. | When showing NOW, it doesn’t allow you to scroll up to see all available trains without changing to DEPART AT to an earlier time to see the train you are on and the departure and arrival times…I shouldn’t have to click “GO” ahead of time for the trip I am planning to take and have it annoyingly follow the whole trip just to keep track or have to change the Depart Time from NOW to see trips within the last hour.  Even right now it is showing only one train ahead of mine and that isn’t even the train I needed it’s the one two before. | MTA Scam you in the train . Charge you in full. Ticket to Bethpage could be $10.75 but the conductor will charge you 17.00 $They blocked me from the APP for finding out about it and now I can’t get too or back from work .

Now however, the app is refusing to process this card or ANY card I add to my account for my ticket. Speaking to customer service the gentleman said they were aware of this glitch for quite some time with the commuter card and they don’t have a way to fix it. I just have to keep trying and hope I get lucky? Insanity. | I download this app because I though it would be helpful for catching the train. They had not option for any train stations in my area even though there’s a ton. I typed in my closest train station it said it didn’t exist. This may be a good app if you actually have a train station you can look up. | Nowhere near as functional as the same app used by LIRR | Fast and convenient | Amazing app — easy, convenient & a must have! 

You can check any train schedule, purchase any amount of tickets & track your train! | The app started as a major step up from previous attempts. The euphoria from that is now gone and it is puzzling as to why the MTA has eliminated the round trip payment option. At first I thought it was an error, but sure enough, it is gone. Now you must make two transactions, which is not the end of the world but…why?!?!?! The MTA needs to leave it alone and make improvements where improvements need to be made, like on time performance and safety. | Why is the round trip option gone?  This must be a mistake. | Ileana obnoxious and rude we heard her on the speaker. She then came and beat the door in the bathroom. When I was trying to use the toilet and activate Ticket with her attitude. I just gave her another 20 bucks and told her to get away and then somehow I’m being rude and obnoxious and ridiculously out of touch with the normal customer service that MTA has had for 20 years. I will not be riding this and more. I’ll take an Uber and go into the city she is pathetic as someone who is in Washington DC more than Connecticut. We have a MetroCard that we use. We have actual people who assist us not people with attitudes just because she’s union doesn’t mean she should be speaking to the people the way that she did. | Love the addition of the current trip to the trips tab | The newest update makes it so when you select your ticket and go to pay the app is stuck loading and will not go to the transaction page with your payment options. | The app is very user friendly.  I’ve only used it this app a couple of times and it has been very simple to read when the next train and easy to purchase ticket. | This app is extremely convenient. I use it all the time. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | Love this app. Train time table, service updates, ticket purchase, all in one app. Easy to use, no fumbling around for information. Very happy. | If you’re riding the LIRR, make your life easier and just use this. | Very much improved over the previous version | I’m very convenient right off my phone don’t have to stop at a station to purchase a ticket! | Great work | The long beach line has run excellent since the grand central opening, do not change any times as a monthly ticket holder for over 10 years from babylon/long beach ive seen long beach is the best running line. Keep it up ! | Currently Today the schedule is misleading everyone and no good hope for trains. On an important day the LIRR let me down | Yes | It doesn’t bug out, it’s fast and smooth. Does what it’s supposed to do. Looks good! | Hurry up with the robot Tesla trains. | Easy to use, convenient and reliable app. Stop thinking about it. Download and start using now. | This app is a great improvement to the previous

It would be nice if it did. The arrows at the bottom make little difference. | This store has everything enjoy the people | Great customer service in every dept | I have deleted and reinstalled Staples three times and have no problems until I try and download “Easy Rewards” only to be told unable to enroll now!
If you want to keep my business when you call it easy “it should be”. | There’s no support for wallet passes. I’m not gonna go to the checkout, login to the app, then hunt down the barcode deep in the settings every time I have to buy something. | The app doesn't work! | That’s enough, because it’s pretty bad | I am loving the new rewards program and the staples.com website has a large selection | Staples is a perfect solution for Printing, office materials including computer and furniture…Satisfied !!! | It shouldn’t be this hard to spend money with you guys. Half the pages on the app don’t load, and it’s super clunky. The old app at least worked. | I like Staples. So, I went to Staples to buy a color and black ink. | Have used the Staples app for years, but my entire purchase history and favorites list have been wiped out. Insane. | All my order history has been deleted. And no information is available about “Easy rewards” even in FAQs - how to use/how much are those worth/how may points are required to buy any specific product? | Going to uninstall—what’s the point of having an app that just spins the Staples logo when you try to open it. | I cannot stand the new version of the app. It’s not as easy to find things as the previous version. I felt like i was on a scavenger hunt trying to find what was so easy in the previous version. | The old app was useful. This is not. Further, it does not handle iPad use. Bloody waste of space and time. Don’t bother with this one. | The latest update is horrific.  It uses a browser interface and is much worse than the app was previously.  Today’s software developers are horrible. | Downloaded today since the old app no longer worked/prompted to download the new app. Definitely nice improvements with the UI and the speed. The only thing I can see after making a couple of purchases (and having to log in multiple times) is the lack of Face ID to log on. Add that to the app and I will gladly come back and give you five stars. Otherwise, well done. | I still have not received my file caddy. It was supposed to arrive about the 19th.
Helen Barber | It would be nice to have an easier way to find the correct cartridges or toner just with the printer number. Also is there anyway to have the cartridge number with the name of the correct printer that you can use it with. | The App does Not Load.   It will not allow to Sign Up or use as a Guest.  It won’t allow to use the SEARCH.  What is going on???   No part of this App works.  This App doesn’t work at all. | The LOOKYOUNEEDSIS review is spot on…this new, unbelievably stupid and useless  app is the pits!!!!!  Even AI wouldn’t be able to figure out all the mindless information on rewards, points etc.  Once I use my $14 owed to me from recycled cartridges (not even on my account after more than a month ago) I won’t be going to Staples any more!  I don’t need this frustrating and aggravating system in my life.   You idiots in Corporate better rethink and fire those responsible or you’ll be out of business! | What a sweet deal. I wait until the big sale comes around. .45 cents for k-cups is amazing! | Wonderful human being ! | Just wanted to thank you for making it easy to order | All previous points are nowhere to be found (who has them?). App shows no bard code or rewards number. Totally useless. | …for the membership card, please. 

App also seems very slow to use. | This app needs a update. I have an account but I can’t log in. The app gives you an option to put your email but it doesn’t recognize that there’s an account. So it automatically tries to create a new account | Why does it seem like this app has become harder to use?  Even a store employee couldn’t help me, so I gave up on using the app during my transaction.  Less is more. | That is formatted for a phone for an iPad. I will admit that it works better on my phone than the last version, but if you are making an app for an iPad make it fit the screen of an iPad. You have the money to pay the developers. Get it right. | App stuck on let’s see if you have an account. Glad I can still use the old app. | I love how easy it is to use this app, whether I’m trying to find a product, browse for sales, or compare prices, I can do this all right here!! | Hate having apps to get rewards & coupons.  Just use my phone number | This new app is terrible. I try to download it like it tells me too and then sends me to a screen to select store and just sits there. Does nothing. Won’t let me go any further. | Downloaded the most recent version of the Staples Rewards app. I use it on my  iPad but it is a horrible looking. It is designed to fit on a phone screen. I tried using the enlarge option but it loses focus and wastes screen space.
I deleted the new App and will continue to use the older version I still have on my iPad, since the new one replace it! | Your app no longer works.. I have no visible rewards, despite being notified of $20 in rewards plus additional 1000 pts from you for problems encountered. Can not find the teacher I support to donate to. There is no where to access the school or teacher.

You need to do much better! Please fix all the glitches. | This app right now is a total mess.  It does not function well on my iPhone and it forced me to change my username and password—because it only allows me to sign in using an email instead of the user name I used before.  When I did that it took away all of my rewards points.  Also, the new point system nexts fixing.  I turned in 5 ink cartridges for recycling and it only gave me credit for 4.  I was way under the monthly recycling limit.  I’m going to complain to my local staples store too. | I tried several times to create an account with this new app (even though I already had an account, which I’ve used recently on a Windows desktop), and when I get through with entering all of the information, I cannot access the submit button at the bottom of the screen. I guess I’ll be going to Office Depot in the future. | I have long loved Staples, especially the teacher rewards and have been a frequent customer for years. After my experience with the new East Rewards app, I’m not sure I will be buying at Staples any more. The products are great, prices are okay and customer service usually great. But using this app was a nightmare. The clerk and I played hide and seek with finding my card and my rewards for almost half an hours while I allowed others customers to go ahead of me. I had looked at the app earlier, then pulled up info I needed before I went into the store. Inside the store, I honestly believe the info moved from place to hide. When I managed to pull up both my card and my rewards, only one the rewards I had went through. Either Staples intentionally makes it impossible to use promised rewards and uses this app only as advertisement, or the app developers don’t know what they are doing. | Start over folks. After downloading the app, creating my account (even though I already had a Staples rewards account) because nothing transfers over, once I got to the store it did not recognize my sign it. So while 7 people queued behind me, and your very helpful store associate also trying to get me in, I simply gave up. I will likely shop elsewhere going forward. This is an absolutely brilliant customer DISLOYALTY app. Well done folks. | Was forced to download new app. Asked for my login email but does not see my account. I had been logging in with an ID before, but it no longer has that option. It’s making me create an account. I can log in via the browser. So guess I’ll opt out. Don’t want to screw up access to my account. The old app was fine and very convenient. Don’t know why it’s not recognizing my email? | I am stuck in a constant loop of the Let’s Go button from easy rewards to the loading screen. Can’t even use it! | Keeps wanting me to create an account. When I already have one. Heads should roll! | Is it just me, or is the new app “framed” in a wide black margin? I feel like am looking through a key hole. | I got an email saying my rewards number was removed saying it’s tied to a different account! 
Now it’s asking me to create a new account.
Also there is no information on how to get a new paper card-or where to see my old one. This is crazy plus the fact that if I read it correct-staples rewards for ink will change from $2 each to a point system? 
I will probably be going elsewhere as I used to LOVE my Staples membership..now.,Im not too sure | The new update to the app changed the entire UI and it is a confusing mess. I say this even taking account that changes require a bit of adjustment.  It is just not well thought out and messy. | I’m a supply manager for a small medical company and have been using Staples for supplies for 20 plus years.  This latest app is a nightmare.  Was hard to get signed into.  The shopping experience is glitchy and unpleasant.  I do not see any improvement on the customer end.  It shouldn’t be this hard to shop an app. | Love my local store 
Great service | On Feb 13 2024 I upgraded to new version. First it is an apparent smartphone app that isn’t formatted for the gen 6 9 inch iPad I have. It is just a vertical narrow ribbon with one inch black filler bars on each side. Why did you change from the last version? It filled the screen with multiple choices and worked fine. This one is next to useless. Fire someone. There are a lotta people outa work that could do better…

Feb 18, 2024 update - I needed 24 page presentation folders I used before but couldn’t pull them up in the search feature on the new website. So I used the exact same search words (without “Staples”) in Google and the top pick of dozens was what I wanted on the new website. But there is more..

I checked thro and ordered two and proceeded to check out. The website had an old expired credit card it was trying to use (?). I selected PayPal but it stuc’ on the endless circle on security check. There is no feature to remove or delete the basket (?) so tried for my Mastercard entered 18 months ago. They don’t have it. So I printed out what I want and hope to go in person to the local store (unlike the old app it didn’t show whether/they have stock).

A competitor could not have done a better job of sabotage. Yes fire IT, but upper management. must have blessed this. Maybe there are bigger problems there. I note that Walmart has many supplies I get from Staples but most are not stocked locally..",4.87377,47159,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1f/62/22/1f622257-3fdb-88cb-0bf7-388ff7b7b5fb/8b274ba4-de8a-4693-bf22-9c2a80ade642_5.5_Screen_1__U0028Intro_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0d/a4/8e/0da48e38-45fe-9172-284f-f76b03267f1e/dc28fbf2-7f15-49ef-8c7d-aeacd7e44e0d_5.5_Screen_2__U0028Intro_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/4d/34/db/4d34dbdb-d967-b92f-8414-3c709c419c23/a00aea42-83d9-4b16-891e-e4961a8ae2a3_5.5_Screen_3__U0028Shop_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f5/d7/d0/f5d7d0bd-f278-ce44-51e1-7779462e12c2/72f9e5b8-e5d0-4a4a-abf0-fcc94a420297_5.5_Screen_4__U0028Easy_Rewards_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/17/dd/a6/17dda6a3-dca9-b11d-30db-05f94ec6ae5c/00db0bf0-8047-4462-8ddd-420672b19328_5.5_Screen_5__U0028Coupons_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/20/8f/b5/208fb5ba-fafb-b9c3-a5f4-5176781b2175/d3b07ecd-0069-49f2-8c01-f002a72c91b8_5.5_Screen_6__U0028Bar_code_scanner_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a7/81/02/a7810276-f0b5-cb09-265d-d94ab4e962b7/d9902be1-88fd-41aa-b1cb-03e7b0759759_5.5_Screen_7__U0028Order_Tracking_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ba/a3/78/baa378ca-17fa-8758-b0b6-003621bc0312/7a5be777-64e1-47ba-80a5-d37c78b2ed8a_5.5_Screen_8__U0028Services_U0029.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Love Indian point park ❤️ | This is a wonderful website to book camping sites and national parks. It’s very helpful. | This app makes getting a reservation so easy, you can do it on the road going to any campground!!!  The campgrounds here are in terrible shape not been mowed or weed eated in a while. Had to bring our mower out. | I’ve only used this once so far. My main concern is that it doesn’t take my trailer length into consideration when it searches for available campsites. It keeps showing me campgrounds that are unable to accommodate my trailer. As a result, I wind up checking numerous sites before I discover that the campground is unable to accommodate my trailer.
Other than that issue, I really like this app!👍😁 | The site is good for reserving but for example you cannot call jackrabbit Campground and talk to a human to find out if a site can accommodate two tents or just one or just a camper or whatever it might be. There is no human that you can reach at the campground. You just get some call centre and they don’t know anything except the little bitty square picture there. Kind of frustrating when you were trying to figure out if you can put two tents on the site or just one how steep is it etc. | Easy to navigate and reserve camping spaces. | We love it | Just like that, I’m booked for a weekend trip in two weeks. Easy filtering. Good information. Yay for this app. | Works well | Easy to use and great information on all the sights available. | At a National Monument this worked great, Apple Pay worked  and there were no hidden service fees. My first use felt hopeful. 
Sadly, my next attempt at a BLM site it added a fee (sprung on me at the last step) and didn’t offer Apple Pay. To make matters worse, the CC input interface was non standard and poorly programmed. Also, it required me to return to the kiosk just to scan a QR code instead of working from the campsite. 

This app is a nice start, but has room for improvement. | The app is easy to use and fairly intuitive.  The map feature is great for selecting a site and for finding your site when you arrive.  
   There are 2 things you should be aware of when making your reservation. First, pinch zoom on the map to see all of the campsites. Second, some campgrounds lock the gates at specific times, so make sure you arrive in time to get in. The app does not make his obvious. 
    We have almost always found the campsite information to be correct.  It’s filter functionality makes it easy to only see which sites suit your needs.  Inputting discounts is easy and straightforward.  
   This is one of our favorite camping apps and definitely our favorite for making reservations. | This app is super easy to use and to find campgrounds. The calendar feature makes it easy to find spots for the dates you need, and to book online if you are ready. Prefer the app over the website, but have used the website on occasion. | We have been camping at Smokemont for 21 years . What a treasure ! The location , the people that run and maintain the campground are first class ! And don’t forget the campers that show up …. Quiet couples, families big and small all enjoying the peace and beauty of Smokemont . It’s a great place to kick back and enjoy life . Thank you COE! | Please bring back the ability to filter out partially available sites. Was one of the best search functions and now it’s gone. | Do not like the 14 day and not camping for 30 days. Every time I go camping there are open camp sites that no one is camping in. I don’t mind 14 days and leaving for a day or moving to an empty camp site. If someone has the time and money to camp I think they should be able to camp in I site that is not rented. | Great app and really simple to use. | Love the app | Booking at peak time is really hard. Otherwise great app | Beautiful camping area looking forward to many more camping trips! Great place. | Would like to be able to save senior park pass number in profile | The restrooms were not clean!
We complained but to no avail. Wiped bugs off about all. Outside smelled clean but actual bathroom was Not clean
We camp here yearly but this was dirty!
We canceled our stay for May 2024 | Perhaps there is just not any campsites available when I look. When I try to reserve a site, it seems that you have to open each campsite to check availability. This last time it was different. It searched by dates. Glad I got a spot. App is very convenient. | The app is easy to use it’s just not updated quick enough to show sites available or not | Rec.gov has provided us the opportunity to book sites in wonderful parks in the middle of beautiful national forests and remote areas. Campgrounds are well maintained and very natural.  And the ap is very easy to use. | I book a lot of camping trips and Recreation.gov is by far the best app out there! It’s very user friendly, the campground maps are great, the descriptions of the sites tell me exactly what I need to know and the pictures of the sites is what we all want to see. | Love The App | A pretty darn good app that is easy to use. thanks! | Literally drove 2 hours to the geological region to enter ‘a daily lottery’ and the app either did not load or claimed my location was not in the region yet I was right in the middle of the circle. What a joke | Have used it a couple of times, works OK | Asking for a phone number? Selling my info? App doesn’t show map of BLM, geared towards third part booking. This app is for city soy Karens, not for serious campers. | Great place to camp | Great to have a fully functional, on the go platform for park/site information and reservations. | The way the app works it is hard to tell which days a site is available if it is only partially available. You have to clear the dates each time to which days are available. Then you have to go to the next site and do the same thing until you can string enough days together for your trip. | After three years of camping been wanting this sight 44 . A hard one to get. Well so excited to actually find it open. And so we get there and 😢 power box was not working 30 amp and 50 amp was not working. Had to run on 1/10 all weekend .  ☹️☹️☹️No at the gate , did get in touch wil someone finally and the say it going to Monday before they can get to it 😖 not happy with the price i paid for this sighting. | Fun and fast we love everything about this website | There is no way to choose an area with a horse camp filter check and see what is available. You have to pick the campground first, followed by the date and at the apply the horse camp filter to find out it’s not available. | Is always easy and fast to look and find a camping spot using the app. | I wish it was easier to see availability for sites | Buy, go and enjoy. | Makes finding adventure so easy when there's an itch to scratch! Everything I'd need in one place, plus the app itself works great | When booking fiery furnace passes it slows to a crawl.  The website lost my profile within the first week said it was corrupted and did not exist.  I had to recreate another account, so frustrating. | Loved my experience and ease | This app is user friendly. Love it. | This app does what it should very well | We enjoy this app so much.  All campgrounds have been safe and clean. | There needs to be a feature where you can put your dates in and see available campsites instead of having to go back every time that is super annoying | I like how easy it is to use and find the open campsites that I’m looking for | I was a park ranger for 26 years doing many reservations. The process you have implemented is quite easy and efficient.

Brought it to Apple, Apple denied it. Was told that they would help me and refund me my money if nothing else worked.
Have not heard a word since. | $49.99 for word of the day? Does not include the word categories, $9.99 per category is required !!

What a joke !!! | Like dang all I want to do is see a random big word everyday WHY R U ASKING ME 15 MILLION QUESTIONS CHILL | Come on people there us a subscription for everything. $50 bucks a year? Really?  Nothing the developers can say justifies this. | I cancelled my 20 secs trial | Cool idea. However, there should be games implemented to assist with remembering the words. | Love being challenged and educated everyday. | I play this stimulating game every day! Highly Recommend!!! | I don’t like that they use a business tactic that consists of making you answer a bunch of questions and then telling you at the very end that the product/service has to be payed for. | I hate that the introductory questionnaire asks who your role model is and only has a bias list of people to choose from. You can not skip the question. I deleted the app. There is only one person of color and all the choices are wealthy people who invest in things that are harmful to the environment and show little regard for the greater good. They have nothing to do with words or reading. | I havent used this app in a few years. But opened it up to look at some saved words to find all my data gone and now being force to pay to use. This is poor. | Was $50 had access to all types of word packs, 4 words a day. Now it’s one word and you have to pay for everything. 1/10 would not do again. I have asked for a refund for the remaining months since I’m only 3 months in and what I agreed to pay for and what I have access to now are drastically different. Will update if they refund. | It’s a great app but it’s costly. I can’t afford it. | Every time this app tried to update itself it fails miserably and it makes everyone else’s lives more difficult. This most recent update has made it so that every single time I go into the app, I have “missed” the time for the word of the day and I am forced to watch an AD. I’m sick and tired of watch a 1 minute long ad every time I want to quickly learn a new word and it genuinely makes me not want to hold onto my streak. Thanks for letting yet another app get ruined for profit. | Worth the money and time. | The daily word is properly written and used in a way that assist you in understanding the fullness of the word, with graphics and pronunciation. | I want a refund as you charged me $149 and then still keep asking me to pay for premium access. What a joke! | I don’t want word of the day, I want to see it listed like you’re promoting it. | The developers of this app, in their never-ceasing quest for new features and profits, have just released a brand new version.

It is so new that all the previous contents and saved words were deleted, without any trace, pre-warning, or remedy. Even preferences are reset probably because the new and the old are essentially two apps.

This is not the first time this app has undergone such maddening metamorphosis. Each reset is drastic and not necessarily better. 

I cannot trust this app to remain stable to be of greater use. The disregard for existing users in order to chase new ones should have adverse consequences. | feel like I wasted my money on the premium subscription for this app. I loved it so much that I ended up buying a Lifetime Premium Subscription. 

However, after the recent updates, the app has become buggy and I can only view the words in three albums in the ""Stop Saying Very"" game. All the other albums are now behind a paywall. I am extremely disappointed and I would give this app a zero-star rating if I could. I don't see any premium features. | I have enjoyed this app daily for years, however, with the recent updates, I’m bombarded with three mandatory ads before viewing a word. I don’t want multiple words—one word per day is fine. I’m going to delete it as I’m not going to pay for a “free” app, and the intimidation to pay is outrageous. I also am not interested in this newer game format. I just wanted one word definition per day. | When ads stop like before, the rating will be 5 star for sure! | I love(D) this app and the words that are offered daily are really good.  I’m not sure if it was a recent update or what- but now in order to view the word of the day I have to watch an ad or update to premium to see.   I don’t review often-but I really do enjoy this app and am just confused why the sudden paywall. The one word has always been free without having to watch a 2 minute ad. 🧐 | I was going to download the game. In fact, I did download the game, but while going through the steps, I had to select an actor which I thought was a role model and many of their selections should have been in jail so I decided to uninstall. | I had a 310 day streak going + the words I liked. After this terrible upgrade 4 days ago it started me over to 0 & cleared my likes. Extremely disappointed & ashamed of the ppl running the app. I was considering buying in but not anymore. 
Word of the Day went from an A+ to a C-. | I liked it a lot and the way it helped me to understand the concept of words | Even with premium my lock screen widget disappears if I don’t open the app every other day. The widget is why I purchased the premium version, quite frustrating to be honest. I believe it is intentional as a way to get users to open the app. Don’t waste your money if you are hoping to get a widget that functions without opening the app. | Since you can only test out the app after inputting a bunch of data and signing up for a trial that is automatically billed at $49.99 annually, here are some nuggets to help determine whether it’s worth trialing.  

The word of the day words and definitions are “meh” at best.  The intake requires you to tell the app whether you know certain words but the third day, my word of the day was one of the words I had indicated I already knew.  The definitions and sample sentences are, IMO, overly simplistic and often not in alignment - the grammatical structure of the definition often suggests a different usage than the sample sentence, leaving me wondering how to properly use the word, and turning to the googz for further context. 

Each word of the day is presented as a card that you “scratch off” by dragging your finger across back and forth, like a video game for a 4 year old.  I normally appreciate some gamification, but this is embarrassing and tedious.  The scratch off reveals a picture intended to represent the word.  I’m a visual learner, so appreciate this, though it’s hard to get past the mediocre art at times.  In addition to the definition and sample sentence, you can click to hear the word pronounced.

The app is only available as an annual subscription, for $49.99.  Oddly, when I went to cancel it, I clicked “see all plans” and noted that the same annual subscription is available for $39.99 and $59.99.  You can also buy themed “albums” for $9.99 each that offer 14-15 words.

The AI underpinnings are apparent in every corner of this app - the intake, the definitions, the art, the sample sentences - which may be fine if you’re looking for a crude vocab builder and have a deep nostalgia for paint with water coloring books, but it lacks the nuance and context that language demands and falls way short of its price tag. | They are not sending me words. | Just trying to improve myself, why does it have to cost money. | I initially found this app very helpful. One feature I particularly liked was the ability to search for words and add them to my collection, allowing me to check them later. However, after updates, the option to save these words into my collection was removed. | If I could give it 0 stars I would. I was very much looking forward to getting the word of the day app and spent such a long time filling out my personality traits and my “word interests” just to be hit with a $50 price tag what is America coming to. I’d be better off just flipping through a dictionary than dealing with this sorry excuse of an app. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!!!!! | Why is there not a simple way to add words to a collection? For example, I don't see an option to add a word to my collection when i search words nor is there an option from the word of the day?? | It’s good to be reminded to the Larmon new bar each day on top of everything we already have to remember, but it’s very useful. | I wish you could set it so you can chose to remove adjectives and only learn nouns and verbs | Could there be more attention placed on the usability of this app?? 
Where can I see all of my liked words all in one place. Too many locked features as a so called “premium” user. | App was a little glitchy at first but developer has corrected the issue. The words they send are always interesting and I feel my vocabulary is broadening. | After writing down my review a month ago with my disappointments regarding the update, the new update has fixed the problems amazingly while still incorporating some of the new features and making the app easier to navigate. Very good app and I highly recommend as well as a round of applause to the develops for listening to their users feedback. | Downloaded the app to just further expand my knowledge as an AM habit to get the brain going. Said it was free and oh it is for all of 7 days and then it’s $50 a year… all these ads claim things are free but they really aren’t. Very disappointing. | Definitely one of the better vocabulary apps. But there are some weaknesses to. The definition of the word is too limiting. It will be great if you have more than one example of use. Or links to other sources other than google. Is there a way to stop the ads? Pay for app? Would love to filter vocabulary based off its form. Meaning like to see verbs adverbs as it is etc. not that interested in scientific nouns. | There’s no way to save searched words to your collection. Other vocab apps have this feature. For a subscription app - I would think it would be included. 

Also - even after paying for a yearly sub, we still have to pay for the word packs? | I had methodically organized categories for the new words that I came across each day. What I was hoping you'd do was create perhaps a quiz option for the flashcards you save but no what do you do- make us pay $9.99 for albums of words that have no pertinence to me. And another thing.. I have premium, let me experience ALL of the features.. thats literally why I pay for the premium version! What the heck guys? | It should be a new word weekly or biweekly, not daily. This gives a person time to memorize and retain the word. | Too difficult. Nothing is useful | There are been several instances where the app pairs the term with an incorrect definition. | This new version is not the app I originally subscribed to! I can no longer save words I looked up into my collections. How frustrating!! I’m so upset. Please fix this issue! | This app has redesigned itself a couple of times, however on the most recent redesign, it screwed up keeping track of my 241 day streak. Whenever I pushed the “today” button it took me back to last year so I couldn’t log the correct day. Kind of ruined all of the fun of the streak. Not sure I will renew my subscription at this point. | The newest update took away some of the best features and demands I pay to get them back. Before, I could look up words that describe emotions, sounds, sight, and all of that for free. 

Oh, and it delayed my history. 

How is this an “update”? | Every time this app updates, it changes its entire interface and you lose all of the words you saved so at this point I think I’m done using this app because there’s way too much ambiguity and there really isn’t any set structure for the app so every time you come to the app it’s different! | Easy even after taking the test. You only get like 5 words in at 10 hour period. Also the words repeat themselves semi-regularly. Why pay for that?

Update: I ended up getting premium at a steep discount and then they changed the app suddenly so I only get to see one word a day. The update also erased all the words I had saved to review.

My keys are not ready and I still have to give my license and CC. | Site easy to use. Reservations completed easily. | Great! Love it! | Excellent stay. Great staff. | I been a loyal customer for almost five years. I love the easy check in and the deals I get are tremendous | Nice and easy to use | terrible | Had issues at first, but no problems in a long time now. Good job. 👍 | I want to praise “Ms.Robin” who works the front desk during the day. She is very helpful and a great attitude all the time no matter what maybe going on.
The new stay over housekeeper is Sweet as can be
Also I want to praise the maintenance man his name is Travis when something needs fixed he gets it done no matter what it is. He is very talkative and very polite
I’ve been here a month now and love it
Just wish was a little cheaper LOL | I travel for work 3 weeks out of each month for winter and fall and a bit less in the spring .  Thanks to this app I a. mTitanium with Marriott and platinum with Hilton and some other hotel chains that I have less. The reason why I’m thinking it is because every time 100% I try this app every properly every date every city says no availability which I know is almost impossible.I don’t have time for every time I want to book a hotel to call the customer service.I have tried calling customer service to find out if there’s someone who could help me with this app but goes on deaf ears.I’ve even tried, which I saw in the other reviews to try, wyndhamhotels.com/appfeedback but that too doesn’t work . I just want to know how does this company stay in business if they’re always says no available. So if someone from Wyndham wants to give me a call and discuss this, perhaps maybe I will start using them again but right now it’s a waste of my time. | I have been a rewards member for over 10 years, yet I am locked out of my account. | We travel a lot, and Wyndham Rewards makes staying in their hotels a pleasant experience. | Thanks it really helps me!!!😊 | Great app! Works great and fast! | A quick and easy way to make your reservations for any Wyndham hotel. Everything is so simple. | I booked my rooms for extra nights in 20 minutes | I hate to say this, but, I stayed at a Wyndam hotel in San Antonio, I believe it was a Baymont, I was horrified at the conditions and the rudeness. The shower was broke, tv would not turn off and kids were playing outside unsupervised at 2:00 in the morning. Needless to say I will not return to that establishment nor will I ever be subjected to that lack of cleanliness. On the flip side of the coin I had a situation where I booked a room in Round Rock Tx and I found out it was already booked solid. The customer service representative was beyond helpful, he found me a room at another hotel, reserved the room and the desk clerk there was beyond amazing!! The Days Inn in Round Rock Tx was the location. The staff was incredibly nice and friendly. | I have been with WYNDHAM REWARDS for over 20 + years and have been enjoying the benefits and loyalty. | Always a comfortable stay when traveling with my dog! | We so enjoy LaQuanta especially because they are pet friendly. The website makes it easy to let the hotel know we will be checking in with a dog! | Would give it more than five stars if I can | I’ve used the Wyndham app now for almost 2 months, about 6 weeks out of those 8 the app has been down for extensive periods of time. This last time it’s last over 2 weeks & is still currently down. 
4-22-24 ; app is down again, attempted to book at one hotel & was given error message & then got an email that I booked at an entirely different location! | Well I agreed to leave a review so here it is. The app is quick even on 4g data. | Reservations can be made fast! | This is my favorite La Quinta!! The location is very convenient for all my needs. I stay here every time I’m in Madera (every couple months). The staff is always accommodating for me (handicapped with recent surgery) and very helpful!! I highly recommend this La Quinta!! | Easy to use and well organized. | Only complaint is different rules for different folks and they make it a bit tough sometimes but I love going here for the most part | Have used app several times with to problems but have had issues once. Was unable to book with points and the app indicated no rooms available so exited the app and tried again using payment option. Payment option showed rooms were available, when we arrived at the hotel we had two rooms booked and were getting calls from another hotel that I ha only viewed as another option. Also have found that there have travel apps that have indicated a lower price than what is shown in this app. | I normally use a 3rd party vendor.  I’m gonna see if using this app is more beneficial. | We always enjoy our stay every time! | Love reserving easy with this app !! Makes travel easier and no worries about getting a room | My first go to when looking for a hotel. | Could have more rewards for long term stayers | I'm so impressed with this app. Great functionality. Updates rewards points quickly after cancelling. Makes it easy to rebook right away. Easiest vacation planning I've ever done. Thanks, Obama. 😉 | Easy to use and great pricing for members | User friendly. | The Wyndham Barclay credit card is great for earning points and getting free or discounted hotel nights. However, the hotels have been everything from pretty nice (Bend OR La Quinta), no frills but clean (Port Angeles WA), pretty crummy (Campbell River BC) to barely habitable filthy (Exton and West Chester PA).

Traveler beware. Wyndham has no health standards. Apparently any hotel can sign up for the “discount program.” | App was simple to use. Got a great room great price | Works | Super easy to use with minimal effort. lots of information on every page and easy to find more information if needed. booking a hotel is really just a few clicks and i appreciate that | Try to reset my password and never received a link, again…… | Easy to book rooms on the app. with full amenity descriptions. | Slick and easy to use! | As my title suggests..this is one best app experiences i've worked with...
 
--it's clear how to go about a Wyndham Properties location search.

--easy and accurate information provided by the app leads to a great experience at check-in and more time doing what i want to do>>experience a another great Wyndham Hotel that provides everything i need when away from home.. | App works goood. | Simple and easy to use this app. 10/10 | By far Wyndham Rewards is the best hotel rewards systems out there.

How does Plane Finder work?
Plane Finder receives real time ADS-B and MLAT signals sent by aircraft to transmit their positional data to land based receivers. This technology is faster than traditional radar and is used for air traffic control and navigation. You can check our worldwide flight tracking coverage for free at www.planefinder.net

I found it very useful and even contacted Plane Finder how it was being utilized.
Plane Finder quit supporting my app and came out with a new app that appears to be the same thing. They wanted me to purchase their app (AGAIN?). 
What happens if I purchase their updated app? Are they going to discontinue my new app to squeeze more money out of me?
Never again… | I use it every day and have found out that I can depend on it ! | This used to be my favorite app of all time. Now, you click on 2 planes and it pops an ad. | This is so much fun a when I see a plane I can pull up the app and it will tell me what it is. | I love tracking planes on my plane finder app | My primary usage of this app was on Apple TV. And suddenly it stopped working. | The old bait and switch scam. Oh it works sometimes, then for to reason it will want you to agree to a free 7 day premium trial period. If you don’t agree to sign up for the free trial period it won’t even let you track your next flight. A total rip off and scam. | I’ve had a great experience! I own the premium and it works perfectly! There are a few problems though. The 3D mode is very laggy when planes are on the ground. Also, some plane models look odd. Like the 777, looks like a a330 to me. I also logged in with Apple, and I can’t figure out how to open my account on my phone. Other wise, thank you! Great app. | Always Works great. Recommend | Great app overall, but I think there should be more things to do without having to by the pack | So, I’ve downloaded a lot of apps. But this has got to be the best app I’ve ever downloaded. I’m not kidding. It’s got everything you need to track a plane. And not only that, it goes above and beyond. As an aviation YouTuber, I want to video tape rare planes flying in the sky. I wouldn’t have gotten the views I have without Plane Finder. I’ve tried other apps, like Flightradar24, but Plane Finder is still the best, hands down. It has AR, so you can quickly see what and where planes are in the sky. It shows every single plane currently flying. And much, much more! Download Plane Finder now! Trust me, you’ll regret if you don’t! | Great app | Bought the app for AppleTV a long time ago but developer has stopped supporting it now. Shame as it was a good way of having the flights showing on a bigger screen. | Fun app to play with on a clear night. Seeing who’s coming from where? To seeing the planes leaving and  where they are bound for. | Update 2/28/2024

The developer responded that my review didn’t sound right and would please send examples of erroneous flight data in the app. I had already deleted the free app and moved on. When I went to download it again to help the developer, it wanted me to pay after a free trial of seven days. Nice try. I’m not paying for an app that doesn’t work. If the free sample tastes bad, I’m not buying the actual ice cream. 

It has begun to freeze and data drops out. Many times if you touch a flight it will give flight info which is obviously for an entirely different part of the world. The ads to upgrade to the paid version are ironic: why would I pay for an app which doesn’t work right? Alternatively, are they holding me hostage, promising an app that DOES work if I give them my credit card data? | Precise , and informative! Always there! | Features like ad flight by boarding qr code , some information about baggage allowance more info about the airlines .. | This application is amazing and all but is it me or is it your exact location doesn’t show anymore ?? | Amazing i got to my flight on time | I’ve had this app for over a year and it’s really amazing how accurate and easy it it to use.

It’s fun to see what planes are overhead and where they are going. Even on a cloudy day you can use the camera mode and see where the plane is in the sky. 

Would recommend this app to anyone because it can kill some time and keep you occupied for awhile. | Super praticable! Keep up the good job! | WOW | Always fun to see where the planes flying over you are going and to find the longest flight | Had app after I paid for it and could see all the information on flight. Then app was taken away and I now have the free version and can’t see information. Don’t know how they can take a purchased app away with out refunding my money. | I use this to track my 2 pilot kids. This is never correct and difficult. I thought the difficult stuff would go away when I paid for the app. It’s still useless. No cross talk between devices.  Use FlightAware’s free. It’s better than this paid version. | App is great now one of my favorite apps to use, just I hate the fact you gotta get premium just to get 3D, I wish the developers would make it so you can have 3D without getting premium, please developers make it happen | Total rip off developer of this app. They sell you the app, and then decide they’ll suspend your use so they can charge you more every month! | The program is great for showing type and company logo on aircraft, but you have to manually locate where you want to watch.
There is no location dot showing where you are or airport location.   You must zoom in and try to locate where you are and then check aircraft in your area. | Sometimes it’s difficult to get the data to show when I click on the airplane symbols | I have the free version, and overall I really like it. The augmented reality view is definitely a big plus. The layout of the map view is really good too. I like the alerts for planes squawking 7700; it’d be nice if you could include 7500 & 7600 too (or maybe even let users specify what codes they want alerts for). The only other thing I would note is the info screen that comes up after you click on a plane has a lot more details locked for the premium version than what FlightAware gives for free. I understand there’s a limit to what can be given for free, but with a little more this app could definitely blow the others out of the water. | Awesome app that I prefer over flight radar 24. Minus one thing. If you click the scheduled flights for any aircraft, unlike FR24, it’s rarely correct. Usually showing random flights that aren’t even connecting to each other for future flights of an A/C. Wish this was fixed to be more accurate like FR24 | I have no complaints about this app. Love the options and it’s very accurate. I use this when plane spotting outside the airport or just watching planes fly over my house. | Set your parameters correctly and it will give you plenty of fun tracking what’s going on overhead. The real time accuracy is amazing. Worth every dime. | Very good | Sitting in the back porch underneath flight paths, it’s a perfect app to identify aircraft. Sitting in the aisle seat, on an aircraft, it’s the perfect app to see how much farther to taxi to the gate. | Why is the ADS-B feed lagging by 1 or 2 minutes in some cases? | I got this at a friends recommendation and it does have a cool feature to be able to point up at the sky and identify a flight. I find it a bit frustrating because many times I’ll try to find it known flight and it doesn’t show it listed on this app whereas on the other major app, it sure is listed. It’s free, it’s useful, it’s fun, but it’s not as accurate as the other one. | Best flight app I have ever seen! Love the 3D graphics of it, having subscribed to this app is well worth it! | This platform does provide limited & at times even completely competent reports given the context of aircraft. Even still, it is not even as primarily useful as an ADS-B antenna on an offline laptop. Free or paid version of the cell phone app. If I have to say more, just disregard & carry on. | I have contacted the developer about the military filter not displaying military aircraft as shown on the OpenADSB app. I have both apps and have compared them along with the online site. Nothing matches up. But this app for commercial aircraft is great. | I really enjoy this ap. I wish more aircraft had the identifier equipment onboard. I live on the north coast of Oregon and there are 2 to 3 aircraft that go over that can’t be identified. | Wanted to try this app out with the free 7 day trial as promised however was charged $18.99 right after the download 🤷‍♂️. I didn’t get to enjoy or look into the workings of it, due to the disturbance of being charged right off the bat. I’m looking into checking this app out, but just wanted to inform everyone who may be interested that they may be charged up front for it. Hopefully the makers can refund my funds and maybe get this straightened out for others | Can you just do 3D and military tracking for free?😡😡😡 | I’ve had this app for a very long time and you’re trying to make me pay subscription fee for it!  Keep it! | As a subscriber to FlightRadar24 (FR24) my expectations were already high given how accurate and innovative that app is.

As a United Airlines CSR at Logan/Boston, FR24 is a tool I use at work. Especially when  I’m meeting a diverted flight. 

My initial impression of of this app is - it’s fantastic! I’m very much looking forward to seeing whether my hunch is in fact true. That this app will swamp FR24 in terms of customizable settings and options. 

It’s already blown FR24 out of the water in terms of subscription costs. 

So far - CONGRATS! | This app will blow you away with what it does. You want to know what planes are flying right now around the globe? This app does that! Your country? Yes! Your state? Yes! And you can drill down to your local airport! Hey what plane is that? Just touch the plane and it opens a new window with all the specs. What military planes are flying? Just select the filter and VIOLA! It shows just those. There is a whole list of things you can do with this app. Try the free one and I bet you will be subscribing soon there after! | This is a decent flight tracking app which provides good but limited info on the free version.  Doesn’t provide some obvious info like the type of aircraft, however.  Much better free apps out there. | I really enjoy the detailed airplane flight information provided in this app. We live near a municipal airport and it provides detailed information about any plane in the area. I particularly enjoy the highlighted flight path of the various planes. The photo feature is VERY useful for capturing information on any plane that is visible. Good value for the annual subscription!!",4.72234,43150,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/67/1d/3e/671d3e6d-ac92-c013-cefe-6b8d23fe0519/b2269dde-46e2-4550-8632-a66d061f2452_1-Alt.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/86/b7/bf/86b7bf6c-cec5-cf51-1053-a05824978fb4/6d34d3f5-a989-4fc7-bf71-fb49d1c7bec1_2-Alt.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f5/42/3f/f5423f39-4cfa-b354-2c19-305437f0e8fd/77a6fb9a-ae15-4a7f-8cdc-a528a1e25965_3-Alt.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ea/38/c3/ea38c33f-2817-e4cc-c937-e03589938e73/40e3836b-0341-477e-adb1-4da2ab5731f2_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/23/98/fa/2398faaf-6e5b-1ccb-aa45-0f58ee4e11ec/7350341d-c16e-43e4-9af1-36ea3823fe92_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6e/a9/fb/6ea9fb2e-3ddb-9d92-01a7-108ec5b1de2a/7aa7a3b9-c0e0-4b2e-a600-f1ecfd19fefb_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/31/04/20/31042097-5250-1d4d-12a1-5882026e9db4/86de6c3c-9ef3-4c3a-aebe-aee9ebbb5827_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/f0/72/84/f072847d-4b54-79b5-a763-a54469d22213/1bc3a62b-91cb-4d47-841d-98708438673e_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/94/8b/43/948b43e7-5fe4-c5ea-0c77-2480867290d6/aebcdc3f-1581-4bd0-968c-d320bf1142f5_9.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f0/7d/ce/f07dcec5-338a-7981-b622-bf2349d77ece/dbdab305-0dac-449a-815c-5586ba09df9a_10.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/13/2c/03/132c0303-c533-be82-360b-021ca5e694e1/952a30d2-e0ae-4b8f-82c6-2313745f4eea_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/c8/02/e6/c802e6c2-210a-dc51-56ee-fd9ce68479a5/8d43e416-0092-4f05-840b-b9516e7022de_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/36/7a/9e/367a9e96-31e1-7c4b-5084-2b93283ec5c0/b2f060ca-12fc-4f45-973a-47f3cad8f4de_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/76/8c/f9/768cf9d9-1592-d75a-7a9d-d4f7b7834df6/9416ab95-a407-41de-8067-404d57cd8ffe_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/42/0a/2b/420a2bdf-ce20-b807-fdbe-7dcad2ad02e8/6223b104-e546-499e-a6e0-6372f1b00a12_5.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9e/f6/8a/9ef68a4e-e3dc-4b6d-dbec-c3fbfc91110e/5caf4385-46e1-4dfe-830a-6d8f626f4147_6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/a0/31/cd/a031cd25-f791-cc2f-8c62-166b855f5f05/0e1e0a46-1fc0-4274-9802-4242d93b629e_7.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/64/f6/fe/64f6fe6b-471a-437a-87b7-fa46f8089ce4/3a5eabf0-c7b0-41a9-9cc1-a371bfd12c30_8.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6b/d0/c3/6bd0c377-bd23-4960-ec0f-2c780b7f7089/d697dfac-4d89-4b9f-a671-09e350a88b4d_9.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/75/60/ba/7560ba8e-04e0-11a3-7365-53571f9aaa50/db414291-c3dd-4da6-9dbf-c0b754a91929_10.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro

Users should be able to type into the app the desired destination (Waterworld, Jurassic Park, Mario, whatever), and be provided a walking map to that destination. | I just love universal studios movies | Easy, effective, and smooth operation. | La verdad el precio es alta pero no deja de ser lo máximo para divertirnos en familia y ver cómo se hacen la películas en ciencia ficción… | This was the best way for me to travel while we were in universal. The way it showed the wait time helped me to plan my trip on what rides we should go first | I went in 2017 I think and love it. I’m going back this year. Can’t wait and see more attractions. See you soon to universal studios | Visiting Universal Studios is our favorite family time activity. Using the app to order food is a great convenience!  Great service! | We’re from Miami, FL. I took my 4 kids for spring break 2024 and we had a blast! It was their first time in California. Super Nintendo World was out of this world! So interactive. I love the west coast and can’t wait to go back. It did something wonderful to my skin. | Absolute messy. Numbers not being called in any sort of order. We waited for an hour and a half to receive our food. | We have been 8 times this was our last time on our pass. The park was so overcrowded. Lines for food places were 45 mins.
Lines for just rides were over an hour. I have never seen it this crowded in any of our past visits. I chose a bad day. But can’t understand why they allow this many in the park. Not worth the money when you spend hours in lines. | very useful when at the park and i also still take a look at the wait times even thought i wen there almost a week ago on a school trip lowkey miss it 😣😣 | Be nice to have all the attractions listed in an area, such as Mario World all you can see is the ride, none of the other attractions. | I can’t even use this ugly app. I didn’t use it for a while, and now it says this app has been disabled or something and I’m going to Universal soon and now I have to get it on another account! | Gg gamer | Universal charges insane prices and can’t manage the basics. | This is a REALLY great app and it’s helped me so much to get through the place and out of it while surviving. It has a lot of guidance BUT the map can get pretty confusing sometimes. | Thank you ❤️ | This is so Funnn I love this app so much thank you universal studios Hollywood for bring me joy 😁 | Se tardan mucho los juegos | This is a review on the APP, not the park.      
 
The app is fantastic. I can see wait times, view restaurants, create an account, and view my annual pass. I can also see my SUPER NINTENDO WORLD at Universal Studios Hollywood badges and achievements clearly in the built-in mini-app, and switch between SUPER NINTENDO WORLD at Universal Studios Hollywood accounts. However, there is no link to book a time to join the queue for Toadstool Cafe. Instead, I either have to go the park and scan the QR code near the entrance to either SUPER NINTENDO WORLD or Toadstool Cafe, or watch a YouTube video of someone getting near the QR code and scan it in the video to book at home before I enter the park. In my opinion, allowing guests to book beforehand via a link in the app will reduce stress and time-slots for the day filling up by the time you scan. For example, I can book Saturday at 1:00 P.M. on Friday at home via the in-app link, versus scanning at either entrance on Saturday and realizing all times are filled up that day.

There are other minor inconveniences with app. Otherwise, it’s great.

Esta es una revisar en la APP, no en el parque.
 
La aplicación es fantástica. Puedo ver tiempos de espera, ver restaurantes, crear una cuenta y ver mi pase anual. También puedo ver mis insignias y logros de SUPER NINTENDO WORLD en Universal Studios Hollywood claramente en la miniaplicación incorporada y cambiar entre cuentas de SUPER NINTENDO WORLD en Universal Studios Hollywood. Sin embargo, no hay ningún enlace para reservar una hora para unirse a la cola de Toadstool Cafe. En lugar de eso, tengo que ir al parque y escanear el código QR cerca de la entrada de SUPER NINTENDO WORLD o Toadstool Cafe, o ver un video de YouTube de alguien acercándose al código QR y escanearlo en el video para reservar en casa antes de entrar al parque. En mi opinión, permitir que los huéspedes reserven con anticipación a través de un enlace en la aplicación reducirá el estrés y reducirá los horarios del día que se llenan cuando escaneas. Por ejemplo, puedo reservar el sábado a la 1:00 p. m. del viernes en casa a través del enlace de la aplicación, en lugar de escanear en cualquiera de las entradas el sábado y darme cuenta de que todos los horarios están llenos ese día.

Hay otros inconvenientes menores con la aplicación. De lo contrario, es genial. | We all hade fun | I can’t purchase parking tickets | Half the menu is not on the app. This makes it a waste of time. | Need blackout dates for digital tickets… so we know when not to go | The food I ordered thru the app was complete however I was never notified thru app to pick up.  I eventually made my way down to pickup food not knowing food was ready for pick up. | Our family had the best time. If you are there for the interactive band make sure you tape at least twice so you can get the stamps and keys or you’ll have to wait in line and do it all over again | This is an absolute joke of an amusement park, if you can even call it that. 12 total attractions throughout the entire park, and TWO rollercoasters. And I had to pay $144 for a day. You’re better off just getting a season pass at Six Flags for less than half the price, and you’ll get a heck of a lot more rollercoasters there. Only reason Universal gets a lot of foot traffic is because they’re fricking Universal; they can get away with anything. | Took my son to Mario bros and it was closed he was so sad 🥹and fast and furious not in service also 😡 drive from far away for this bad experience | The Mario cart ride broke down and now I’m stuck sitting here in this tight space while I’m claustrophobic and they won’t let my family and I go out and walk to the exit the their for this ride is not the best this in my opinion was a great concept but they failed to execute it | Crumby app forces you to turn on notifications or you can’t use it.  I don’t want to see your ad solicitations - surely this is a breach of Apple policy?

Stop it or shut this app down. | We love it here.! It’s the best.! Had to renew our passes and now we are back.! | This will be my first time to California because normally I visit Orlando Florida. I was born in Miami Florida and I have a Cuban half Cuban half Puerto Rican friend from Miami that moved to Los Angeles California in Pasadena California. And again, this would be my first time to visit California. | Nice and easy to use. | Missing basic mapping features and help/chat is not very helpful.
Filtering would benefit from walking with first time guests 
Activity Suggestions would be helpful to manage / balance park loads and better engage users | You should hire someone who knows terms like usability, business processes, user stories, and best practices. This is a completely inconvenient, ill-conceived application. Overloaded interface, everything is extremely confusing and completely unintuitive with a lot of bugs. It is not clear how it was tested and released into production. Do you like this product yourself? Great park but the app is really bad. | 🍔🍦🍨🥳😄😍🍕🍝🍰🎂😁🍿🍟 | 1. Open the wallet in the app and open season pass QR code screen)
2. Leave the phone alone so the phone auto locks the screen

This will make the display brightness go down to 0%. 

This has made my phone impossible to use until I went into a deem-lit store without sunlight. Worst bug to have when you are in line at the park gate with so much sunlight. | Rides are all broken. Money is stolen for services not provided and app fails to warn users. Useless app. Probably another thing made in america | Bad app | Upgraded ticket to annual pass try to make park reservations never works just a scam unethical business practices. | This app makes everything more difficult, some rides are only by virtual appointment. Which is ridiculous.
They make you download the app to get in the park. And they don’t let you know about the way that I virtual appointments only. | I want to come back there for real. I hope I get to see you again Universal Studios I miss you thank you Universal Studios. I’ll see you at home right now. I really want you to come. I wish you was Universal Studios here. what are you have to travel back? I wish you didn’t have to do that. I wish there was a universal studios here. I’ll see you guys again promise and thanks for the ride with you. I love the water was the best place. Thank you 
Love you guys I hope I see you again promise
Bye-bye, love you guys I’ll see you again later in the year again I hope you guys have the best best new year. Have a nice time. I like it there I want to come back and thank you Universal Studios.
I really like the way that you made the place my favorite one most favorite favorite favorite one was the Harry Potter. That was the best one. Mostly I want I want to do the Harry Potter win again I also like the transform one that was very that was really like. Emotion I really like the place I just really want to come back and my last one that I really really liked was the Jurassic Park. That was the one that I really liked it was the best one ever. I hope you guys love the place I love you guys. I’ll come back I promise OK I’ll see you guys . | ee | It is a really good app because you can know how long the wait times are for every single ride and they kind of show us what foods we can eat, and and we can also check what time they close and open | Sussy Baka | This app is garbage. It always failed when I tried to link the ticket. The estimated wait time is not accurate all the time too. Garbage | We have been trying to use the app to schedule activities and it just isn’t working. | This is the best app ever if you are going to universal studios!

And, where is the iPad app? | The website is so wonderful! I never took enough time to look at the information, benefits, events etc. It’s such a blessing! I appreciate it.🙏🏾♥️💖😊👍🏾🤲🏼 | Frequently, when I bring up an article of interest in the AARP app, I am distracted with another task and need to come back to finish reading.  However, upon returning to the app, I'm taken to the home screen and then have to find the article again.  VERY ANNOYING!  Otherwise, great information that is timely and relavent. | Hi on two occasions I’ve completed a task but not received points. Sometimes my account says I have points and then all of a sudden it’s at 0. Very frustrating. | Can’t keep my thoughts on answers. | Informative | While I like the app, it grows gigantic with use.

Help !!! | Hoping we use it | Every time I get out of it to check something it resets to start page. The start page is cluttered. You can’t get your booking to make changes. | Your cite is difficult to maneuver! | I really like the AARP app however it is very frustrating to use. In this day and age it’s ridiculous that this app seems to be stuck in the past. Older people are way more tech savvy now. Please catch up to us. In no particular order here are the things I have found so far that have created this frustration. For reference purposes, I have the iPhone 15 pro max. So it’s a new phone using an outdated app. 

1. If you turn the phone to landscape mode, either whatever you were reading freezes or it returns to the app home screen. 

2. Same with playing a game.  If you turn the phone you have to restart whatever game you were playing.

3. If the phone goes in sleep mode, you have to restart the whole process of going to that game again. 

4. Some games just don’t work at all. They open but you can’t play them.
 
5. Even when reading an article, if your phone goes into sleep mode while reading, when you wake the phone, the app goes back to the home screen and you have to find the article again. 

5. Why can’t we save an article to read later? I literally have to send an article to myself via email so that I can read it another time.

6. When anything is open, the word “Done” appears at the top left of my phone. Please get rid of this and just put a back arrow so we can choose to just stay on this page and go back to the Home Screen ourselves. 

7. I have not used this app yet on my iPad, but from what I’ve read in other reviews that is also a nightmare experience. I use my phone for the most part. But if this is the case, please, please have your app designer fix these flaws. This app shouldn’t be so frustrating to use.

Let’s see if they actually respond and do something about this or just send a canned response and do nothing. This is what appears to happen when reading older reviews complaining of these very same issues I have just written about. Reviews that are 3 and 4 years old stating the same issues. 

Please fix these issues. You would have a great app if you do. | This useful app works very well on the iPhone. However it just doesn’t cut on a iPad. As more and more seniors gravitate to the iPad as their primary internet device, this app needs to be customized accordingly. It is not helpful to stare at an iPhone rectangle inside an iPad screen. Thank you, AARP! | It’s a learning process. Stil adjusting! | All you get is a black screen. Worthless now! | * Search for articles
* Ability to bookmark articles
* Return to where you were if you switch out of the app and come back to it. 

Frustrating it doesn’t have these basic features. Would give it five stars if it had these features. | Great Resource App | Im still discovering all the benefits of my membership that seems designed for my specific tastes and needs. | I work on a computer everyday in my job and this mobile app is not user friendly. | I just love the benefits AARP offers. | Very Good | I like reading about the articles published by AARP because it's legit and not hearsay compared to other establishment. Keep up the good work. | Not able to schedule  an appointment to have my taxes done.
I have tried but the page looks as if aarp app is not stable. I’ve used the app before had know problem. | I hope you always do these articles 
All so interesting -my hope is that I can always get to read them even after a month or so sometimes in that day I haven’t alwsys the time like to go back 
Thankyou | AARP may have lots of benefits but they slam you with ads so much it’s overwhelming. The app also constantly tells me my password is wrong (which it isn’t) and locks me out of my account. It’s very frustrating. | For over a week I can not load games.  Only get a blank screen.  What’s going on? | Every thing you ever said came true ! Thank you | Whether you need advice on insurance, health, finances, travel, AARP have many resources. | I played games for a very long time and now it is impossible to find them easily. I know you want me to look at the other stuff but IDO NOT WANT TO. I WANT TO PLAY My GAMES WHILE MY HUSBAND WATCHES FOOTBALL, COPS AND CAR SHOWS.  I am finished w AARP. | It’s very informative.I just pay service I had no idea it had this much information.I am amazed with what I learned just today. | Love this membership.  Lots of help and discounts
Whats not to love | Accessible and reliable. | Enjoy the words of encouragement that I get here. And the reminders to enjoy the life that I do have. Getting older is privilege and it’s nice on this app to be able to view so many different opportunities and ways to even enjoy life more. | I love this !!! | Should you leave the app for any reason or your phone just locks from time away, you can’t get back to the article you were reading. If the article is not currently on their front page you cannot search for it to return. Should you swipe oddly left or right the same thing occurs and you can’t get back to the article. Frustrating! | AARP is the best for saving especially at the age when you need it mostly.thank you | I love the discounts 😃 | I try to take advantage of as many AARP benefits as I can .  They help me a lot in my “old age”. Thank you AARP! | Thank you AARP for being Here For Us folks 55 and older. 
You provide the American aging public with much needed and wanted information. 
The beauty of AARP is that it is plenty of business and plenty of pleasure
I feel very much kept in the loop of information.

It’s infuriating someone updated so numbers are recognized during conversational exercises | Learning Catalan on this app. There were only a few options of apps. I like the way this app pairs pictures and words and pronunciations. It also seems to have a fairly robust amount of content. 

I had my friend who speaks Catalan listen to some words. She said the accent isn’t perfect but it’s useable and the words are correct. One critique is they frequently write phrases in the formal you (vosté) tense instead of informal which is more frequently used. I’ll manage because I’m learning verbs from many sources but someone else might sound oddly formal if this was their only learning tool. | Listo | It’s amazing and it teaches me danish very well thank you Mondly ❤️ | Makes learning easy and helps with pronunciation | Skiizzerr | I'm currently at an intermediate level, hovering between A2 and B1 in my Spanish learning journey. Firstly, I'd like to express my admiration for the aesthetic of the AP; it has a visually pleasing layout that's easy to comprehend. I appreciate the frequent vocabulary additions and the presentation of verb conjugations in a straightforward, practical manner. Moving on to the speaking practice, it stands out as genuinely beneficial, a cut above the majority of chatbots out there. It demonstrates active listening, offers correction, and allows room for errors. This approach enables you to master phrases while listening to a mother tongue while acquiring the rhythm and correct pronunciation. I think it's pretty impressive; well done. | I’m using Mondly to learn German. (I speak Russian and Italian in addition to my native English)

My complaint is that Mondly introduces German nouns paired with their indefinite article (ein/eine), but “ein” is used for both masculine and neuter nouns. 

German nouns should be introduced with their definite articles (der/die/das) so that the gender of the noun is unambiguous. 

Mondly’s German module is seriously deficient because if this — which is a shame because I love Mondly otherwise. | Voy por más con esta linda aplicación y de seguro les daré las 5 estrellitas completas! | The review posted here finally elicited a response. But it was to tell me that they could not find my account or username. :-) Four messages to customer support, sent through their form. And preferred email. No reply. But they could take my money? Support for this app is poor. | I like it it keeps changing up the way you learn so it reinforces lesson. | I use it everyday. Mondly is taking my Spanish to the next level | …… | Great application | It is best app to learn language | So far, so good.  App easy to use and fun.  Learning Croatian language. | I tried Duolingo for a whole year before I found this app. I am definitely happier with Mondly. I was never alright with the stalking aspect of Duolingo and what’s more important, after the initial period Duolingo wasn’t teaching me anything new. So definitely, Mondly is the better choice. | Great app, but technical support is slow/nonexistent. I bought a 2-premium account package, but can’t find any way to assign the second account. Queries through the website’s support window have gone unanswered. | Muy buena aplicación para aprender inglés | Mondly has much to recommend it and I’m actively using the app. Against the standard and purpose for which it was designed, it is deserving of high marks. 

Of course, no app is perfect and my main complaint with Mondly is that at this writing I see no option for Latin American Spanish. Nor does it appear to be devoted exclusively to Castilian Spanish. Instead, in its vocabulary, verb conjugations, and pronunciations, Mondly is a mishmash of both.

I urge you to break these out cleanly into two distinct and separate options.

That said, I recommend Mondly to those who want to jump-start their language learning with a variety of effective and enjoyable exercises which are presented in a very accessible way. | This is a great app at a good price to learn Thai. The lessons are short, well structured and very useful for every day conversations. I particularly appreciate the option of reading in English or Thai. Highly recommended. | Perfect!! | There are thousands of vocabs to learn. But I’d also like to learn grammar of each word. If there are some explanations about the meaning of each word, this app would be a perfect one. | I love it very muck it teaches me a lot even though I just downloaded I also enjoy that it takes the time to go over thing and it lets you repeat it. This app if very good to learn communication in Germany and different languages you need to learn thank you very much this app is a 10/10.!!! | I like this app because it’s only been two days and I can say about 7 difrent sentences in Spanish | It is very well.I like this app. | I really enjoyed this app so I just signed up for the yearly family package, but had issues after the upgrade. I emailed the Mondly Team and the issue was sorted and fixed within a day. Very satisfied customer. | Excelente | This app helped me so much I have improved my Spanish so much! It’s so helpful so I really really recommend it to all of y’all! | Excellent review of language no matter your level.  Recommend. | Great app to learn many languages. Great interface. | After taking some courses it starts to give you same exercise every day in daily course. And other lessons are very short and useless | Very helpful for learning Bulgarian! 🙂🇧🇬🇧🇬✝️✝️
JESUS LOVES YOU | I have Duolingo for years to learn Spanish and Japanese. I’ve started using this app to learn Chinese, and the experience is so much better. Where I left Duolingo, not being able to speak the language or listen to the language, but read very well, this app has me working on speaking and listening immediately, so that I can be more comfortable with it when I go into the real world to use the language. Considering that that is why I learn languages, this, and itself converted me instantly. Duolingo is good, but Mondly is great if you want to know how to speak the language. | I am from America and most of my family speaks Urdu and I know a decent amount of Urdu but when I started to use this app I gotten better I would recommend this to someone who wants to learn a new language.👍👍👍👍 | Much better app than Duolingo. | I generally like this program, although it has some errors in it, so it’s still not five stars, but I really like the fact that I can practice speaking. My other programs for learning Japanese don’t have speaking capabilities. | خیلی خوب | Only thing I wish was if they built in the polite “krub” “ka” and honorific “khun” I got a funny look for leaving it out 
But I’m pretty happy :) | I love the fact that it checks my pronunciation.
I’ve been using this for a week and honestly I love it | Thoroughly enjoy your Ap and find it very supportive and professional. | Monday has good daily lessons and is less gamified than other apps but still draws you in | After multiple attempts (and hundreds of dollars) to find an app I can actually learn from and interact with, I have finally discovered Mondly. It does have issues, such as silly ""quizzes"" after only 2 words, and does not always recognize my voice/accent when repeating-but aside from that, very happy with it. The cartoon nature of some apps left me very frustrated. Some programs spend way too much time on grammar, or simple conversation. Or they used really irritating ""characters"" (Duolingo). Mondly is good for me-a visual, audio, and hands-on learner, and without annoying voice types. Suggestion-a way to slow down even more would be nice. And get rid of the ""here's a short quiz"" after introducing only 2 easy words.

So you better hope your scooter isn’t broken because you’re not getting your money back. So the only company that doesn’t auto-refund if you only make it a couple yards is also the only one allowed to operate in this city, funny how that works! | After years of (mediocre) service I’m no longer able to make use of spin scooters. The app threatens legal action if you don’t lock the scooter to a bike rack after use. Firstly, there are barely any bike racks in town, and most are on private property—I’m not going to trespass into college property (where the scooters don’t even work) to lock a bike in a place I can’t end the ride. 

Secondly, the scooters don’t even have locks on them. It’s an impossible task. I’m done. | ❤️ | Used Spin in Chicago last summer and it was ok (Lime was better); now the app shows no scooters. At all. Anywhere. In any city. Sent customer service an email asking if they’re still serving Chicago, and got a reply back that where I can use a Spin scooter depends on where I rent it. What?? English barely as a second language? Really bad AI? No scooters, no support, and every review so far in 2024 is horrible. I guess I’m using Lime. | I don’t know why it will not let me pay, I have money in my account but it will just now work and it’s frustrating as I have to walk a long way home, if I knew what would let me pay for the app I would rate it Better. It keeps declining my payment and will not tell me why | Everytime i scan the bar code it has me double click to use my apple pay and it never goes through. Whenever I try and put in my card it says theres an error. | The app is okay but not good. I don’t recommend it and wouldn’t use this again even if I had to. 

The bikes are the worst I’ve ever used. I travel the country with work and have used everything you can rent on the street from coast to coast. I am currently in State College PA. And I will be petitioning with the local government to get them banned they are that bad and unsafe. The condition of the bike is to be expected for a street rental. Ruff, seats are bent up and adjustments are possible but won’t hold or last. The wireless charging does NOT work on any of the bikes I tested and everyone I asked. The “eletric assist” is just gear changing and does not help with motion. But makes it much worse as the gears are non controllable. I litterly fell off the bike when it felt I needed the hardest gear possible to up hill. Nearly getting hit by a car in the process. If it was possible to press charges I would. These are a saftey hazard and the reason you will NOT see anyone ridding them. Is because they are that bad. | it charges u multiple times without knowing | Only thing is the app wasn’t 100% accurate about batteries. Would use again tho | Prices have become expensive. Almost cheaper to take an Uber. Doesn’t make sense the cost of driving a car is close to the cost of riding a scooter?? | There are a lot of Deadspin bikes and scooters that are not being replenished very hard to locate one when needed | Zero customer service. 

No way to question charges, access additional services (e.g. for low-income students), or do anything but find a vehicle and pay.

Overlong ride charges: for instance, you get charged for the time it takes to photograph Spin scooters before you can end a ride. Have a momentary problem with your cell connection? You’re charged for the time anyway, and you’re screwed.

I’ll be using the rest of my Spin credit and deleting this app for good. | I’ve been using this service for almost a year, and I’ve had nothing but great things to say about them until the past quarter. In winter quarter I kept having technical difficulties with their new updated app (the original was amazing, and now it’s awful). I used to be able to filter which vehicle type I could see and now you can’t do that. Then, I started having issues with the bikes and scooters themselves, they wouldn’t unlock or lock back up way more often then it should, or the app would take forever to load and would then cost me more minutes because “I’m still using the vehicle.” I’ve had to call the customer service team way too many times for comfort, but they’re always really nice and helpful. And now my biggest most upsetting issue… I’ve purchase the same spin pass for the past year, and now they’ve changed their policy to where instead of getting to unlock the vehicles for free, I have to pay each time, AND I can’t use the bikes?! Only the scooters. So yea, I’m out $70 and transportation because of all these changes and they won’t refund me either, very unfortunate. They were a great company until they weren’t. | Won’t let me add funds or use any. | They don’t refund you, but give you credits instead. 
It’s more convenient to walk than use spin. | Too expensive | The monthly pass is not what it says it still charges you and you will have a negative balance on there even when you read it it says you will be able to ride for free for 30 days don’t say after a certain time it will charge you idc about it having more 5 star everyone I no always uses other people because spin be lying it’s sad and spin need to do better | Monthly Unlock pass. Ride all month with $0 unlock fees on every ride, u still get fees even when u purchase the monthly unlock pass , very disappointed, I want my money back, It’s a scam….! | Way too expensive compared to other offerings | Overall pretty good experience except the scooters i encountered in Salt Lake city probably have a 60 percent success rate not fun. | Can’t even process a credit card | I live right on the cusp of Maryland and DC and used to be able to drive from one to the other. Now, Spin changed its rules around that, adding a buffer zone that makes it super inconvenient to commute. Willswitch to the competitor | Fun, convenient and fast! | I thought this would be better than walking but the scooter didn’t work and there is no way to troubleshoot in the app and I was charged 6$ for 5 minutes. | Wouldn’t let me park for 15 mins | This is for customer service or Solution service. I gave a star bc i did not even get responded. I tried to use one of it, charged me a few bucks but it was broken and returned in a couple minutes. Still they charged even submitted a error report | We hoped on, went 2.1 mile got charged $27 each! Uber was cheaper! | Half the time the scooters don’t start and you still get charged the activation fee | Would give 0 stars if I could. We tried renting 2 scooters in washington DC for a shared ride. I unlocked the first of the 2 scooters but when we tried for the second the scooters lock mechanism was broken so we couldn’t rent it.  I immediately relocked the first scooter and was charged $7 even though we got NO USE of either scooter. Submitted claim for refund and NEVER heard back, posting this in hopes I get a response if not to at least let others know this service is a rip off (use any of the other rental providers and you won’t have the same issues I had with Spin) | There’s always some issue, it seems, whether it’s the scooter stopping you because it thinks you’re on a sidewalk, incorrectly mapping your journey and overcharging you, or not ending the ride. You have to navigate a maze to get to customer support and once you do, they’re unhelpful. I like scooters, but this company is seriously lacking | I hope I get refunded the difference that was initially authorized on my credit card | So overpriced! A 15 min scooter ride cost 6-7 usd.

Scooter is very harsh and hurt my wrist so much. Engineers should realize the height/ wheel base ratio will magnify the vibration at handle bar!

The throttle stuck open at a traffic light almost got me into an accident.

I do wish there are good car alternatives in US suburbs. | I sat there for 30 minutes trying to hand you money and all i get is errors and endless validation screens. Ill save today and walk the mile. **** you | Thank you for finding me in my broken state/condition. 

Taking me to your home was very considerate. 

Rabbi’s angels venice beach | Spin has the best rides I’ve done of all the scooters! 250lbs holds me well and battery is solid | It is truly amazing how horribly dysfunctional this app is. Never recognizes parking locations, scooters constantly make screeching noises for no reason. Absolute garbage service unfortunately. | Updated app as forced to, and now it does not accept any form of payment. Made me late for work as was counting on it to work as it normally does | Of about a dozen rides I’ve had to take with them as the only option only one ended when it was supposed to and the others it kept charging for at least 3 min with the longest over 20 min bc it wouldn’t let me end despite being within parking zones. | Spin gets a 40% rating because that’s how often it works. I have been charged for rides where the scooter never unlocked. This service has a long way to go. | Polk-Bush to  Union-Fillmore early morning  ride was mostly car free and fun.  Great time to get somewhere fast. | I have used Spin quite a bit since it is one of the only ride share apps in my area. However, it has recently increased quite a bit in price, making even a short trip almost double the cost.

However, I know this isn’t because of the app itself, but the app does not have a place to leave local feedback. This is a downside because I would have rather addressed this issue towards those who can actually fix things locally. I would love for a feedback field to be implemented to help me help them! | worst app ive ever used complete s show | First off I would like to say that Spins customer service is exceptional, which in part is why I think this review will be read and acted upon because it seems clear that Spin is very interested in their customers satisfaction.   Lately however my experiences have been brutal and agonizing.   I can’t go into all the problems that have resulted in the app not wanting to work properly anymore.   Idk if it’s because I recently switched to an iPhone or not but this is what happens:   I rent a ride and when I’m done I hit end ride and the screen pops up asking me to park legally and then snap a photograph.  After I snap the photo it ends there.   I can’t submit.  Or I submit  it and it locks up.   I can’t remember exactly the point where it locks up but i just get this spinning timer indicating that something is loading but it never does.  I can’t do anything at this point.   If I take a ten minute break and want to ride again too bad.   Sometimes closing the app and reopening will work but in any event when I am allowed to rent again I get a message telling me I didn’t submit a photo.   I couldn’t .   It’s really annoying when I get stranded because of it
   Please fix this bug.   I can’t be the only one having this problem.   I’m using the latest update and I’m on an iPhone 15 Pro Max. | I prepaid for Spin Pass that granted me 60mins of ride time over the course of three days. One of those days the system was down and the next the scooters wouldn’t unlock then I had problems “ending” the rides I did successfully catch(app glitches). Side note If the ride doesn’t end you will be charged per time; even if you parked and no longer using item. THERE IS NO ONE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE/ H R who can help and they admitted to system failure and not being able to RESOLVE any issues upon Spin’s app glitching failures… | Disabled app on my phone tried restarting app won’t let me create account or even login says try again later | One out four scooters actually operate properly. Good luck finding one on your first try. They seem to charge you no matter what. | I signed up two scooters. Didn’t show an upfront cost and I paid $85 for our trip. | When I end the ride, it always shows that parking is only available at indicated locations.

The app crashes when I turn on the location. I tried to just view the map without the location and it pans over to the corner every time I zoom to somewhere in the map. 👎 | Everytime it opens it crashes. Had to reinstall and not allow it to know location to sop it from crashing. Then the map randomly jumps to weird off map directions | The truth is it's such a fun adventure here I'm grateful once again THANKS and THANKS | The app would crash until we found out to turn off location on our settings. The map off to one side and when trying to make it bigger or move over to see the other places, it would immediately go back to its place, most of the time I was staring at a corner of the map. 
The only great thing was the show times and the character times. 

Also, I don’t recommend because if you’re using your phones for photos and then pulling up the app, you’re just wasting battery. I just found a paper map and deleted the app while visiting Seaworld San Antonio. | Like tile says the app it’s trash app soon you get inside park the app stop working. | If you turn on location sharing with the app, the app crashes and does not load. Tested on two phones in the park. If you turn off location sharing and you are able to get the app to load, good luck scrolling around the map. It keeps moving you away from destinations instead of holding still. | Hermoso lugar me encanta para mi flora | I have restarted, uninstall & install app and it still crash while in the park. It’s an okay app when it’s working. | Stayed open long enough for our tickets to scan this morning and now it crashes on both my and wife’s phone despite installs, restarts, etc. completely unusable. | Mostly downloaded for ride wait times. They were not accurate AT ALL! Very frustrating. The map is also very difficult to navigate. | For being a multi-billion dollar institution, seaworld has the WORST app AND website functions for member benefits. I have been an annual pass holder for over a year and the amount of frustration I've had it's unacceptable. It's not just me, everyone else I've spoken to has had the same experience. We cannot log in to see our benefits online OR on their app. If I could give this a negative star I would. My niece and I went for a day trip, and it was IMPOSSIBLE to get a ticket to skip the lines. Overall SeaWorld is fine, but don't let yourself believe ANYTHING will work in your favor.
PS. I never ever write reviews so... | walked a bit following directions to the seaport market which had a large picture of a pretzel advertised on the app, and “pretzels” in the description. got there and they didnt even have pretzels on the menu. what. | The app keeps crashing | Linking tickets not working | This app is pure garbage! I bought the most expensive pass they offer and can’t link it to the app because it takes you to a website. What’s the point of having and recommending people to download the app when it just sends you to the website you started on! Ugh 🤬🤬🤬🤬 | There is zero functionality to add tickets that aren’t populating on their own, and zero tech support to fix it within the app itself. I took the time to chat with a representative on the site that didn’t even know what options the app did or did not have, then said their relinking request would take two weeks to complete. 

I was expecting at least a similar functionality to the zoo’s app capabilities. Very disappointing. | I have called and gone to guest services in. The park to have the old passes removed so I could add the new ones but the old ones are still on the app. The only way to access the new passes are to enter the bar code which is very inconvenient. I have to use the hard pass every time I go to the park now so I hope every time I remember to bring it with me. This really is a pain in the you-know-what. And a common problem according to the facebook group. | I love how it can bring you too the places with directions | I want to use the app for my annual passes but it only shows my old expired passes.  If I log in it’s the same. I have to use my barcodes + zip to access anything and that sometimes also doesn’t work. I don’t know why it’s so difficult to delete the old information or to have my current active information show up in the account. This has been going on for years. I can’t access the discounts bc it says my passes are expired. I do have current active passes. | I don’t always have the same problem with | Wait times are so far off. App says 5 minutes when the wait is over an hour. | I love this app sooooo muuuch that I want to marry it and hug it | I love this app! When we have guest visiting we will use our free guest passes and be able to check and insure the status of our season passes. It’s seriously a really good deal with lots of benefits. | Doesn’t show wait times on the rides like it’s supposed to. | I love how SeaWorld shows live to military and teachers… thank you for the tickets! | The map is awesome, you can see where you are and map your route to your next experience. | Bought tickets on undercover tourist and can’t link them to my account.  No ride times noted without linking your ticket app is useless. | Using my SeaWorld app is so convenient I am amazed on how easy I can navigate through it. | It’s a really fast working way to see the whole park, see the show times & the restaurants that they have. | This app is so great!! | Fix the wait times, they are inaccurate bruh | Fast and expedited | I give it three stars because the wait times aren’t always accurate like one time it said that icebreaker was only 20 minutes and I get there and it says 60 and I waited over an hour for it. the rides are pretty accurate and are hardly ever wrong. it’s very detailed so I can get where I need to go or if I need to find something it’s very easy to find. I love SeaWorld overall because of the fun rides and the delicious food and all the family memories you can make. | I’ve come to SeaWorld Orlando almost every day for the past two weeks. The app is killer. 🐋 | Very useful information and accurate description and time of events. 10 stars | A quick how to video tutorial would be next level helpful. Great tool overall. | Makes navigating the park easy! Also a big help planning out our day with rides and shows! | Wish y’all had an option to make a schedule | We r come eric | Very user friendly. Super easy to navigate with subgroups on different tabs so you can easily hear your search to show you only what your looking for. Rides, shows, animals, food. It has active time gps so you won’t get lost. It shows details of every attraction. Excellent app. | It is fairly a good app, but it could bring more features inside it without the need for loggin to website every time we need information about our passes… | It would be a big benefit if you included in your drop down menu where to meet for encounter's. That way your customers could use the gps finder to get over to the sky needle ride. We missed our Orca experience because we late finding where to sign in. The group left early. | The app speeds are very slow and at times freezes.  

The most annoying issue I have is that ALL of my past season passes continue to display, however, the current passes do not.  I have to go through my purchases to find them.   Additionally, why are users restricted from adding the passes to Apple Wallet.  This was an option at one time, by no longer.  

Please improve this app immediately as can be very frustrating. | very helpful in guiding you to the attractions and seeing the wait time but, the wait time is different once u get to the ride. So its not the exact wait time. | This app always gives me trouble. Most recently when trying to log it, the app just stops working. No error messages, just stops. Definitely does not help with using less physical resources. | Deberían de poder los tiempos de espera en el mapa | No search function. No ability to tap places on the map for more info. These are two essential features that would have made my trip better. | 💯👍🏻 | Prices so high for food and gifts (from China, not very good quality 😏), then they tack on 5%. Bathrooms much cleaner this visit, I was concerned last two visits. Entertainment very good, but where is the pet show? Needle hasn’t been running and how long is construction going to go on? Been so long. | As a season holder you would think you could do more on the app itself but it routes you to the outside website which can be slow to load and cause issues if you need to go back and forth to migrate bar code numbers etc for multiple tickets.",4.91259,82611,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/f0/79/b5/f079b5a0-b005-6245-f14f-9c6c7b1a6837/fd2eb30c-ae21-4d4c-8599-23b46a7adc16_ios_-_1242_-_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b9/68/5b/b9685b21-a707-cd98-3f8a-cfa3a7335265/ae2d6bf1-9e2c-45cf-9184-11364e545573_ios_-_1242_-_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6f/9a/9e/6f9a9e85-5377-e040-3717-9d8d7612b3c9/b417c5a8-ca07-4c61-97c5-6322f863a015_ios_-_1242_-_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/39/70/b4/3970b4f5-b9ae-ab14-c398-c92176b81ce0/975e4791-eb7e-4ac6-863b-a956887c464d_ios_-_1242_-_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/be/95/a2/be95a288-75a5-35d9-f0c2-0df16b645ebf/c3e1fc7d-c535-4f7d-8bb8-ae7bbbe084da_ios_-_1242_-_05.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7f/e8/45/7fe845df-903c-c9f1-fa97-153240235f7f/363a0904-5bc0-4958-bd0e-5b15710013ae_Guide@1x.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/bb/a7/a5/bba7a54e-314c-d699-e7d5-c1e9bf97139a/4b4b2f25-6a32-4326-9daf-cdcc7eb9af9a_My_Visit@1x.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/19/df/72/19df7280-8d45-93c6-fa52-8f3500ac141f/0116dd0f-6aa9-4f1e-b710-18bd3a2d75a1_Guide_Child@1x.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/e9/fb/ef/e9fbef27-a7d7-7ca3-962d-0999967b7814/02663adb-5243-46cc-b900-a499e6ebd358_POI_Detail@1x.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/aa/d4/12/aad41211-f801-c0ff-ea7c-6fa334bfd462/bb526193-6d86-4e36-80ab-dd3d63922827_Inset_Detail@1x.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I am able to cook the steaks but it won’t let me serve them or drinks. It’s to bad because the game was really fun. Hope it gets fixed ! I would give it 5 stars but it’s not working. | The amount of ads makes it impossible to play. Otherwise it would be a fun game. Too bad. | I’m only on level 20 and I feel challenged to work faster.🫶🏽 | When will the update come out? | I like it | This game has awesome graphics for a mobile game and is just like the adds. It's really fun and I am addicted to playing it | I’m not a hard gamer and I got through this game all levels in one week!!
Extremely disappointed | Don’t allow data again | Could had more thing to add to cooking preparations | love the game its sooo fun no wifi try it out best game ever nothing is bothering me soo perfect game 👍👍💗 | It’s my favorite cooking game 
It’s so amazing and interesting game 
If I should rate this game 5 stars then it worth it 
The most interesting part is you can cook in different restaurant | Need an update. It is stuck at the first level of the pizza restaurant. Help!! | This game is so fun it’s funnier when you have a time to feed all customers it’s challenging and entertaining love this game 💕💕💕 | It is so easy and fun to play me and my mom play it all the time and I think that every mother and daughter should play this amazing game | I love this app | Awesome game but there is way to many ads | This game is so entertaining and fun no adds so give a try!! | Pro - I love this game.   con - Way too many ads! | While most of the game is fun and easy, right as it starts when first downloaded the game states if u allow the app to track you to other apps your game will be add free. but adds still pop up during your games. False advertisement? | It’s just that good it’s just that good my mother approved it | I play several cooking games and this one is probably the least stressful. In other games, when you have to make a combo’d item (as in, a specific item with multiple elements like a burger with lettuce and sauce or a burger with cheese and no sauce), if you tap the wrong thing it will make the combo’d item and it will occupy a plate/tray that you can’t clear unless a customer orders it, or you throw it away, and some levels have conditions like don’t throw anything away, so you either lose, or get angry customers and make less tips. In this game, at least in the first level, it doesn’t allow you to add something to an item unless that combo’d item is specifically on the board as an order to be filled, so you can’t make incorrect orders. This makes the game a lot more relaxing and enjoyable! The graphics are good, game play is smooth and easy, coins are easy to earn. I like this game a lot. | It’s super fun and interactive. Although it’s for kids I enjoy this game and I’m a teenager. It’s very fun and it’s great for long plane rides and road trips | So she can cook for people and she so pretty | Made it to level 181.  Game freezes after tutorial. Very frustrating. Have enjoyed it up to til now | What ever happened to “Zen Mode” for games like this? Enough said… | Would’ve gave this game 5 beyond stars if it would stop crashing | I am enjoying this game a lot. | I like how you have to keep things at a certain piece from this game because if you let the customer wait too long, they get upset and they leave but thus far I have kept all of my customers satisfied | In all the ads I kept seeing while playing another food game, it showed the food being rung up, and the server running the credit card. Where is that? This is just straight cooking over and over and over again. Part of the appeal to my daughter and me was getting to ring them up, too. False advertising?? | Rilygud | This is the best free game in the world and it soothes me btw I am 9 years old | This game is fun, I enjoy it but it’s WAYYYYY too easy! I beat the whole game easily, which isn’t saying much. I would like at least a harder level, instead of me not playing a level for 10+seconds so I have somewhat of a challenge. | Love the game itself BUT way TOO many ads!! | Can’t get more buns is frustrating. | I’m not going to spend money to remove the ads. Why can’t there be just one good game without ads?? Good game otherwise | I’m not one to write reviews but I gotta say, I love playing these cooking games, have played several of them and the one thing I always wanted was the ability to keep the phone in portrait mode… so tired of turning the phone… love that I can finally do it with this game!  

I’m only on level 32 but along with the phone orientation, I love that there’s no dragging ingredients involved, the money is automatically collected, AND the coins collected in one restaurant can be used in the next! 

Love it so far! Hoping it continues! | I actually like this game better than most others like it. The tasks are challenging but not so much so that you just give up. The only thing that is annoying is the ADS!!! I can see having to watch an ad to double coins but to then have to watch an ad to COLLECT the coins is unreasonable! I was thinking about uninstalling for this reason because I feel like I’m watch ads more than playing the game. The game is so much fun though | This game would be great for children or seniors who don’t want to start out fast paced. I have played and still play several cooking games. I’m always looking for new ones to keep my interest. There are good and bad points with this one. The good notes are: it is not fast paced (at least in the beginning), you get plenty of opportunities to double your coins, you get opportunities to watch videos for boosts before starting a round after higher levels, you get opportunities to watch videos for free coins, you can upgrade equipment by watching videos instead of using coins. The bad points are: it’s very slow paced leading up to level 37 compared to other similar games I’ve played, it’s very slow on upgrades compared to other games I’ve played (I’m fully upgraded on level 37 and can only make 1 cup of juice and the machine is slow. I’m also still only making eggs with add ons of either toast or tomatoes), there is nothing else in this game to keep your interest (example: no story -which I personally like and no decorating-which I don’t like). None of us like ads but know they are necessary, unless you play Township, Monopoly Go, Monopoly Solitaire or Chef and Friends (which I highly recommend btw), but when the ads are repetitive it becomes more annoying. When the ads are optional for a reward it’s easier to swallow unless they are immediately followed by a forced ad which is the case with this game. Yes, you can close out of them fairly quickly but I still find it annoying. Other games I play will sprinkle them in on rounds where you don’t have the option to watch an ad to double your coins. For example if you replayed a round for the third time for a third star or more coins for upgrades needed for new items. Thats another thing it doesn’t appear that this game offers. Maybe they don’t allow you to re-play rounds because you can upgrade items by watching videos? 
Again, if your looking for the basics and something simple this game may be for you. They make it easy to upgrade that’s for sure. I’m just not sure the upgrades are enough. Even in level 37 I had several customers waiting for juice. Something so simple that was fully upgraded and could not be improved on my part by time management. If you are a regular player if cooking games I would pass on this one. You will get bored fairly quickly. I hung in there longer than I wanted to just to try to give it a fair shot in hopes it would get better. | to many ads | The ads after every round is miserable I spend more time watching ads than playing if I delete this app that will be why. Do developers actually take advice from complaints or do they say they will but don’t?

Yeah that’s what yall say that’s how it’s free. But I have game that are free without a single ad so try again. No worries I deleted the game. No need to respond. | Way too many ads!!! | The game is fun but the music is beautiful and addicting. | I’m really in love with this game!! I like the fact that I can upgrade with just cash. No pesky gems to earn. The only reason I’m not giving 5 stars is because of the ads. If I watch an ads to double my points, I think it’s ridiculous to have to watch another as in order to receive the points. Besides the fact that between every level there is an ad. But great job making a game that is not impossible to win 👍👍👍 | It’s a good game I just really like it | I love this game, I’m not too fun of the ads after every level completion tho. I have to ask tho why does it start all the way over once you get passed a certain level?? Is it supposed to do that or not?? | Way to many ads other then that great game! | اللعبة جميلة جداً ولكن عندما وصلت إلى المرحلة الأخيرة قال ستُعيد كل شيء من الصفر وهذا أمرٌ سيء أتمنى أن يتم طرح مستويات أكثر بدل من أن يكونَ آخر مستوى هوَ 181. 

سأمسحُ اللُعبة، لا أستطيعُ تحمُلَ ذلك. 

جزيلَ الشُكرِ. | Excellent Game | The game is very fun and addicting, however, some levels are impossible w/out watching ads to earn coins or using ""boosters."" 
I made it to the third restaurant and I'm stuck. Only 8 customers come in and even with the booster that gives extra money earned, I can't make it to the 77 coins I need to progress. It's very frustrating 
 I would suggest making some of the levels give you more coins, as you can't really progress/ get upgrades w/out paying for coins or spending an hour watching ads.
 I do like the different restaurants & food choices as well as how fast paced it is, but could use some more work in my opinion
Yes, the ads after every level are annoying but that's part of how they can make cool games like this so I'm not too mad about

I couldn't even buy a ticket.  What needs to be done, is you should have a short cut to buy tickets.  Click buy, going by location, what buses are around, then when you select ask what city they are going to, to determine how many zones.  I literally couldn't get up the screen to buy a ticket with right amount of zones.. so i paid cash. | Why do I need an account to buy a ticket? Apple Pay is nice but not very friendly to single-time users | Meant to tap FIVE stars!! | I wish I could give no stars. | Find a way to make these things live online as tables, rather than PDFs make them interactive – – can users create an itinerary and have it notify through iOS? If so, then I haven’t found the way to do it. | Engage in BETTER ON TIME service!!!! | The utility of the app is perfect, but the UX could use a redesign. The layout of the app is confusing between the schedule/purchase screens. They could at least be unified somewhat so that from the schedule screen you are able to directly link to the purchase screen without needing to go back to the main screen. | Difficult to use | I have now called in several times to get help logging on to my account on the mobile app. I never ever hear back afterwards and my problem is persistent. When ever try to log in it just loads and nothing happens. Have tried to uninstall, delete and create new account, been on WiFi and on data with no prevail. | I am logged out EVERY TIME I exit the application. To log back in, I have to do the Face ID verification at least THREE TIMES. Please fix this bug. | New Jersey takes taxes to make this app, correct? Hire a mobile dev who knows how to build an app. The schedules work though. | NJT forces you sign up through the app. But the app link doesn't work | This app is possibly the clunkiest transit app I’ve used from a government body, reminiscent of those in eastern europe, yet executed worse. It’s hard to believe that adjacent to the the biggest metropolis in the country a system so bad is tolerated let alone was made. | So easy and convenient to navigate and use. | Easier to use | Entering an address in the Address field (for “Travel to” destination) was not possible. The keyboard pops up and covers the “Done” button. The text box is way too large also. App needs broader QA to include smaller screens. | Using this app is a nightmare.  I accidentally activated the wrong ticket and it expired before I could use it.  There is no means to correct it.  I had to purchase another ticket.  I will be requesting a refund which I anticipate being a very unpleasant ordeal. | Every morning when getting to bus I need to put in my password. Nowhere to store this or have Face ID? Frustrating when trying to get on bus and there’s a line behind you. | Your services add so much to our lives! Seniors enjoy such great rates on NJ Transit. Thank you for making it so easy and affordable to get to international airports and to go into NYC! Thank you! | There should be very helpful if we could received warnings if bus is not coming… in the app doesn’t appear but it comes… or it just don’t come, if it happens in that route perhaps it happens as well in others, also drivers need to be more friendly, not all but must of them are always in bad mood | They need to watch a few folks fumble through this app to restructure it a bit. Otherwise the bus updates in real time area amazing! | Shouldn’t need an account to buy a ticket. Can’t reset password on account. Scum bag conductors act like it’s your fault when you can’t buy a ticket on the app and then charge you more for a paper one. All of them criminals. | I got a monthly pass for unlimited rides into NYC from Secaucus. I specifically selected NYC and Secaucus from within the app. The app told me to buy a zone 2 pass. On the pass, it says “interstate,” leading me to conclude it covers transit to New York. I’m here for a month, so I got the $100 monthly pass. I get on the 320 bus and the driver tells me I need a zone 3 pass. The app sold me a zone 2 pass. After arguing with him for a few minutes, I decided to wait for the next bus. Some drivers are sticklers, some don’t care. The next bus had a driver who didn’t care. 

I’m extremely disappointed with whoever made this app. It’s extremely outdated since it doesn’t even include navigation or live bus/train tracking information. But that could be forgiven if they had clear and accurate ticketing information. They should not be so misleading when buying tickets. It’s absolutely unacceptable that I can be guided to pay $100 or more for tickets and then be told “you can’t ride this bus you paid $100 to ride.” I shouldn’t pay for transit and then be told I didn’t pay for transit. 

If NJ transit reads this and decides to discipline the driver who didn’t care, YOU GOT THE WRONG MESSAGE. | This morning I am unable to purchase a ticket and the app asked me to sign out. I go to sign out, but the app says I’m not connected to the internet, so I’m stuck. | I’ve been stuck on a loading page to create an account for 25 minutes now. You can’t do anything with the app including buy tickets until the account is made. Completely useless right now. Hope they fix it! | This app does what it needs to. No bells or whistles.

I am constantly seeing the light rail schedules not being updated properly or not showing the correct times for trains. Big issue. | Love the Njtransit App always feed good times pick up | Easy to navigate! | Using the App was efficient, timely, cost effective. | Very helpful | Can’t buy tickets and whenever I do I get an error but they take my money out with no tickets bought. Fix this. | This app is truly terrible, this morning I tried paying for a ticket five different times. However the app kept notifying me saying there was an error and to try again later.For some reason I was still charged $9.75 five times on my bank account. Not only is this unacceptable but what makes it worse is that there is no direct customer service number for incidents such as these. I recommend anyone who uses nj transit just use cash instead of getting robbed by this crooked app | And give no instructions on how to determine the zoning. Ended up buying the wrong ticket, wasted $3.5 and my fellow riders’ time. | I love the NJ Transit app. It's made getting on my bus so much easier. However, the most recent update makes me attempt to activate the ticket 6x before it will actually activate - a problem I've never had before. Please fix this super annoying bug! | Makes buying tickets ahead of time easy, apple pay function is very helpful | This app will take and steal your money. You buy a ticket on here it takes your money and doesnt give the ticket. Buy the ticket at the machines if possible. DO NOT USE THIS APP | Great transit, and easy to board. Super fast buses and rails. I’m almost shocked compared to NYC where the delay can be heavy. Keep up more signage with PABT to be clear please and thanks. Good work. | Aaa | How on earth do you create an account on this thing? I apparently have an old account with my email. It says it emailed me a link. Never received. I try with a new email. Same thing. Friend just told me he had the same issue. So now I have to leave early to get a paper ticket anyway after trying to use this app for 20 min. | I’ve been logged out, I cannot log back in or make a new account because it won’t send the code. It tells me my account doesn’t exist and when I go to register it says it already exists. I’ve been late to job and school many times now, please someone get rid of this app. I lost my way of transportation. | It takes hours to send out the verification email. Either bad QA or bad service maintenance. | I’m trying to set a route 165 bus stop as one of my favorites by tapping the gray star at the upper right corner of that bus stop’s status screen. The star never turns yellow and the bus stop never appears in my favorites. This same happens for the other bus stops that have an apostrophe (for “feet”)  in their names like “Jefferson St 100’ E of Main St”, “Kinderkamack Rd 100’ N of Old Hook Rd,” etc. This bug doesn’t happen for bus stop names that don’t have an apostrophe. Your system is confused by the apostrophe. Please fix immediately. | this app is only useful for purchasing tickets, any other information about the circles, even the address of a stop, is nowhere to be found. | Someone needs to fix the app!! Weekends especially sundays are not accurate in live scheduling. One minute it’ll say a bus or train will come in 10 mins then it will disappear and say it will come in 40. Please fix this issue | My first time using it, and I attempted to purchase round trip tickets and when I made the payment it took the money from me, but then gave me some error message saying I couldn’t purchase the tickets. Needless to say I have a complaint in to get a refund… but I won’t be using this app again. | don’t ask mandatory world cup marketing questions that i can’t ignore after buying a ticket. my interest or lack thereof in the world cup is none of your business. just sell train tickets like a normal app | This app is unusable.

Once it was so easy and now I can’t do it. Can you help me and tell how to find the tools | I don’t know what the heck you guys did but this app is totally unusable now. 

I have an iPad and have continually used Google Earth. 

It’s fun to search the world for all kinds of places and see them from a global perspective. 

Every time I turn it on now within two or three minutes giant white blocks show up, huge patches of the map disappear and I can’t see anything. 

It happens most of the time with 3-D, but even happens with 2D. 

After about five minutes of use I can literally no longer see anything it’s just a big white blob. 

I have to actually use other apps like Apple Maps now to see 3-D stuff because it is no longer usable. 

I wish that I had never updated the app. 

It all started when this happened. 

Also, the pictures that you see associated with a location you put in now I cannot zoom in on the picture I can only just look at it as is. 

What gives?

eSIM FAQ
What does an Airalo eSIM plan come with?
• An Airalo package comes with data (e.g., 1GB, 3GB, 5GB, etc.) valid for a specified time period (e.g., 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, etc.). If you run out of data or your validity period expires, you can top up your eSIM or download a new one right from the Airalo app.

How much does it cost?
• eSIMs from Airalo start from US$4.50 for 1GB of data.

Does an eSIM come with a number?
• Some eSIMs, including our Global Discover+ eSIM, come with a phone number so you can call, text, and access data. Check your eSIM's description for details. 

What devices are ready?

Who is Airalo best for?
• Anyone who travels, whether it's for business or vacation.
• Digital nomads who need to stay connected to work while abroad.
• Crew members (e.g., seafarers, flight attendants, etc.) who need to stay connected while they travel.

Can I use my SIM card at the same time?
You sure can. Most devices allow you to use multiple SIMs and/or eSIMs simultaneously. You can keep your primary line active to receive text messages, calls, and 2FA authentication (but remember, they'll be subject to roaming fees).

Happy travels!

No hassle, easy to activate, you can check live usage etc. | 慣れてない場合は設定が少し難しかったです。
何度か使用すれば簡単になると思うので
また使用したいと思います。 | I like your plan for multiple countries. However, I’m an older person who’s not very good with technology. If the process can be much more simpler to install that would be great!
Followed up, I am in country and still couldn’t set up my data plan after 3 days! | However a bit tricky to get up and running… YouTube video by young tech guy (not Airalo official video) walked me through step by step. Excellent connections everywhere I went throughout Japan — even in mile long tunnels! Now that I have the app I will use for all overseas trips. | Was easy to install, worked great. Will definitely use again next time I travel. | I would recommend for anyone that travels. No wait time no long distance charges just great service. | It was easy enough and worked great. Make sure you turn off your data roaming and your US travel pass so it doesn’t automatically charge. | Good app. How to clear old expired sim cards? | The service work fine.

Don’t depend on the app data running totals. Purchased the top-up package just before the expiry date. Both the data and expiry date were extended according to the app. But then everything expired suddenly.

According to their support. The data expiry date does not extend when purchasing the top up package. This is the reverse of what the app was indicating before everything ‘expired’.

Los a few dollars. Lessons learned. Getting by fine with Apple Maps downloaded into the iPhone and free WiFi. | Install app. Within minutes get notification spam to buy services. Give app side eye but ignore. Hours later get another notification spam to do the same. Uninstall app. Leave negative review.

I wish these product managers knew how many long term users they lose as a result of chasing short term purchases. So foolish. | Having internet the moment you land in a foreign country is a huge plus.  I was able to set this up weeks ahead of time.  It activated as soon as the plane landed.  I’ve been using it for weeks, and I’m very happy. | We have travelled in Asia and Europe using the Airolo sim with great success.  Easy to load extra data and very reasonable rates. | Tried in two different countries, service did not work in Uzbekistan, then tried again in Turkey and it was great. I think it really depends on country. But overall so satisfied | Great for travel | We are getting ready to travel internationally. Being the doubting Thomas I am, I decided to purchase an eSim for the US (my homeland) so I could “test” the setup process and functionality before I arrived in a foreign country. I am technically challenged but setup was so easy that my first impression was that I must have done something wrong. But I didn’t! I turned off my ATT data and have used nothing but Airalo for the past several days! It works beautifully! This would be the perfect option for those who have limited data plans through their phone carrier and need to beef up data usage from time to time. I now feel comfortable with eSim and no longer fear being stuck in another country without phone data. | you never have to worry when travelling Airalo is your best choice , available in most countries & affordable prices 👍🏼 | The service is not good | Great option to get internet | Whilst I’ve had good experience with Airalo in Costa Rica, I tried to use it in India and later in Bhutan in early April 2024  India was a partial success, as I was able to install a 1 week data sim plan; but after the week was up, I was never able to top up because the app could not make a secure connection and continuously timed out.  

I was unable to purchase a data plan for Bhutan because the app (and web browsers) never was able to make a secure connection (including via VPN).  Finally purchased a data e-sim from Alosim with no problems.

Ironically on return to US the Airalo App worked again.  Puzzled. | Connected to local internet right after airplane landed! Much better to buy local prepaid card….. | Beware that this is an israeli company what will intercept your communications. UPDATE: I visited 7 countries in Europe now and everything is routed through israel. Country Israel Country (ISO code) IL In EU? true Region Tel Aviv Region code TA City Tel Aviv Latitude 32.0803 Longitude 34.7805 Timezone Asia/Jerusalem | Traveled to Japan and had at least two hours of no connection!! I was left stranded in the subway on my way to my flight destination. My suica and google maps would not work because of this and could not even try to get to haneda airport because of this!!! Two hours of being without internet in a foreign country before your flight! Had to pay out of pocket to get on a subway because the internet was down for so long. Will not recommend for clutch data usage in high-traffic areas in Japan! | Excellent customer service via email. Step by step instructions. Connected right after landing and allowed me no hassle connection with Uber driver. | Worked fine for a few days then bam! Lost all service for 24 hours. Still had 7 gb left. Went on reddit and many people stated the same issue with no explanation from airalo. The service came back but a whole day internationally without service that you paid for is unacceptable! | it was very difficult to install.  i worry that it will be even harder to uninstall it when i return home. and i found out that verizon will automatically work in another country for $10 per day unlimited calls if you call and enable travel pass. so i am regretting this esim purchase | Reliable service. Would recommend and reuse | I use it in all my vacations and it saves me time and money. | Pocas aplicaciones te dan este nivel de satisfacción del 100% , esta es una de ellas , fácil de instalar , fácil de usar y funciona a la perfección . Y además … BARATO ! | Very nice. | As my first time using Airalo, it’s been a great experience. I say that because as I’m currently having trouble with installing e-sims, Airalo’s customer service is being more than helpful with the issue. Very attentive. Their Help Center is a great place to start when looking for basics for installation. Hopefully, Airalo Customer Service helps solve my issue soon. | Wasted hours trying to activate Airalo eSIM on my iPhone. No luck. Looked for online tech support. Nada. Bad bad experience. | Worked great across Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.  Simple and reliable. | Being using Aíralo for several weeks now in France and Spain. Worked beautifully. | This is the second time this has happened. Unable to activate eSIM | Airalo works seamlessly in Japan! Purchased Global plan with talk & IM option & loving it. Recommend it highly!! | Service is spotty at times, cutting off without explanation or reason. Customer service was advertised as great, but I could never raise anyone in person via voice or chat. They eventually replied via email. It’s frustrating being abroad and cut off. I’m never entirely sure how well it’s supposed to work, what’s my fault and what’s going on with the tech. Most things worked okay most of the time. But not enough for a five star review. | I bought My eSIM for my travel to Tokyo and not work. Every technician I chatted are telling the same thing and never bothered to read previous chat messages. Then after a day I can’t use the eSIM anymore . Frustrated as I chatted with them for 6h | I needed to keep my US cell phone number on a 3-1/2 year cruise. Problem was I needed access to data in 147 countries. Airalo looks like the answer to my challenge. | I used to stress and spend so much time trying to find a SIM card when I travel . Now I don’t need to worry about finding a kiosk or shop to get a local sim. I don’t worry about losing my own sim and switching out sims. It’s super easy to install the Esim and cheaper too! Highly recommend! | This eSIM is horrible. By far the worst I ever tried. Customer support ignored my refund request. Use Global Yo if you want a reliable and fast esim | I’ve been using Airalo for the last 6 months of my travel and it has been a breeze. Very easy to set up, and it has worked great wherever I have travelled. In doing my research I saw a lot of complaints about the pricing of the data services, so I thought I’d address that here. Airalo may not have the least expensive data, but if you’re traveling to many countries and don’t want the headache of having to swap sims or experiment with different carriers in different areas it’s hard to beat. If there is a minor premium for that it is totally worth it. | Some times the signal is weak and data is very very slow. | Reasonably priced, easy to setup. Has worked flawlessly. Customer support is very good and responsive. | Worked ok in Japan and Thailand. Absolutely useless in Singapore. I have to continually disable/reenable the line just to get 5 minutes of steady data on my phone. | Giving one star because the install directions could use a lot of help. The sim worked for two days and on the third it just stopped working out of nowhere. I’ve done all steps to try to restart the service and it continues to not work. I’ve reached out to customer service multiple times without a response. The chat is a robot. Very frustrating. | I’ve used Airalo in 3 different countries now (Guatemala, Latvia and Austria) and it has worked like a charm every single time. This app has made my life traveling beyond easy 👌👌 | Easy install- however I did have some issues connecting when I made it to my country. But! Support was amazing! Answered my questions swiftly and I was connected within the hour after reaching out. My service has been great. Definitely recommend! | I installed Aerelo Asia back in January and flew to Singapore, the apps works great. I flew to Bali yesterday and My Aierelo stop working. Disappointed. I had to revert back to my cellphone provider to get access to my data. I don’t think I can trust Airelo for now.

Update:
Yes, I was contacted by Airalo thru Apple but, no refund given on the money spent that I could use the service for.  

No, I am not recommend Airalo.  I used Simly.  I had issue as well but their customer support helped solved the issue, unlike Airalo. | Data is a little expensive but works well for El Salvador. | Directions are not user friendly.

But this is not a good app. A bizarre hybrid of being in the app and then thrown out into the website to manage bookings. It needs to be all in app and much improved. | The app glitches constantly - it takes forever to check in!  Also very annoying that there is no automation between AA and BA to make it more seamlessly.  Overall the worst airline app and needs an overhaul. | Check in, baggage scales are inconsistent and inaccurate, weak communication in boarding areas.  They seem to cater to business travelers and don’t really care about leisure travelers. | The app kept shifting me back and forth from the app to the website. Confusing as heck. 
My wife and I are traveling together and she prefers me to handle the details.  But I can’t download both of our boarding passes to my phone. 
The app warned me to scan my passport but doesn’t make it possible. | I have never had so many problems. It keeps sending me back and forth from the web browser and the app.  It wouldn’t let me download my wife’s boarding passes. And it says to scan my passport but I cannot find how to do that. | There’s no help to scan | The worst airline app ever | No choice in seat assignment for Atlantic flight😡 | I booked my ticket with my TSA Pre number, and when checking in via the app, they lost the Pre and I had to go back in line and re enter it. | Poor layout and reliance on the website throughout the app is annoying being a transatlantic flag carrier I expect much better! | Literally has to be the worst airline app ever written
Just doesn’t cease to amaze me that it never works and always glitches and BA can’t sort that out
It’s been like this for years | Slow app
Kicks you out all the time for inactivity
Often dwn
Unintuitive use.
Much worse than american austrian delta el etiad united apps | Keep sending you in a loop to get your boarding pass them you by magic get one boarding pass for one passenger but not the other 3 for your flight and connections. | This app needed some work.
Could never check into my flight to get a good seat.
Said my info was wrong but it was not… | Hard to navigate. Not user friendly | I have to go to the counter, give the agent my Pre number (again!), and get a paper boarding pass in order to use my Pre status at security. | Half app native, half leading to web. Not showing all boarding passes. | Very difficult to get mobile boarding pass 
For second person same booking.
It’s only give the pass to the person who purchased the tickets.
Should be able to get all the passes for all persons in same booking at once | After many attempts to check in, I called BA.  After waiting on hold, it automatically connects me with American Airlines to start all over! | Let me start by saying that we are frequent flyers to the UK because or daughter is a University student there.
Now to my story…..we booked our latest flight to Heathrow via British Airways in search of a better flying experience there and back. This was definitely not the case. When we went to check in only to discover that our seats (that we paid extra for when we booked the tickets months ago) were move, without notification, to the far back of the plane. The agent kept repeating that she could not change us back because we had already checked ourselves in for the flight. That was not correct because we had not checked in yet. No plausible explanation was given for the change and she said if we wanted to upgrade our seats, as we tried to request to correct the issue, she would have to remove us from this flight and try to make the change. This service was worst than flying a discount airline like Ryan Air or Spirit Airlines. All aspects of our travels to the UK and back home to the US have been completely unsatisfactory and it is the last time we are flying British Airways! | This has to be the worst app I have ever used, it doesn’t even deserve 1 star.  It’s been like this for years.  BA please please fix your app | So disappointed that we are not able to check-in prior to arriving at Heathrow… doesn’t anyone test these apps?… I’d love to see a upper manager at BA attempt to check-in to a international flight… 

Integration with the American Air app is a disaster also…
🤷‍♂️ | Absolutely garbage app. Made a booking for 4 passengers. No alert reminding you to check in for your flight, took forever to check in because I kept getting error messages, I can only access my boarding pass, there is no option to print or download the boarding passes of the other 3 passengers. Utterly useless. | The app is slow and very buggy. Am absolute pain to do simple things like getting your boarding pass. | If you have the audacity to use this app while on a VPN, expect across-the-board failure: show my account (sorry), book a flight on points (sorry), se past transactions (sorry). Doesn't always even display your bookings. Usually last to know assigned gate. It'll often contradict what the gate PA screen is stating, or be missing information that otherwise is available. Should probably be able to tell the luggage allowance for your booking or time of boarding, but doesn't -- instead the timeline helpfully (and, yes, I'm being sarcastic here) offers to share your flight info if you feel like providing BA with marketing information on your friends. Seat picking seems to be relegated to your browser (so no VPN). Notifications would be useful (as long as they're related to your travel, not nagging for preregistration or flogging sales): a past 2h flight were delayed three times totalling 4 hours 50 minutes (and I lost my seat, so they were presumably looking for a new aircraft) ... it would be nice if we could rely on being notified about such changes, instead the app said I had no upcoming flights. Checking in and getting a boarding pass is often relegated to a browser - basically, don't trust the app to do anything useful when needed - check in at the counter or well before going to the airport (and then save the boarding pass to your wallet). Tries to collect a creepy amount of information on you, some of it is fair for a company with which you have financial transactions, but others, like location is pretty frivolous (though you can, and should, deny it this). Worst of all, it doesn't work with a VPN. Neither does BA's website, so they clearly think use of a VPN indicates nefarious intends, where in fact it's a very sensible way to protect oneself while travelling and using wifi networks you may not control. | App isn’t great. Kept crashing or won’t execute tasks. App need some work to run smoothly. 
It also have limited tasks compared to other airlines app I’ve used. | Of course, I’m upset do never a good review timing. Using the BA app and the Ba website - along with  their appalling lack of customer service all around- has made my very expensive splurge on a business class round trip ticket Italy to the USA - incredibly disappointing and just pathetic for an industry leading company.  Please get your act together BA . When next  traveling international - I’m going to do everything I can to avoid British airways from today forward . Sorry to say. - frustrated | First time using and last time using!!!! | Clunky and confusing. | The app is very clunky and cannot complete tasks. The back up customer service call centre service is atrocious, probably the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I don’t want to fly BA ever again as changing my fully flexible and already expensive ticket has proved to be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and costly. | Always errors | We fly British Air often from the US. Often my reservation doesn’t show up on the iPhone app or when I login I’m told I have an error. I can’t add the boarding pass to my wallet and when I send my boarding pass to my email I never get a boarding pass only a link back to the Manage my Booking. I want to like this app. Maybe it’s me! | Worst app with a horrible interface. Bad user experience. It is borderline non-functional. Did not expect this garbage from British Airways. Horrible !!! | Couldn’t up date information to allow online check in of my wife for international travel. Her new passport has a new number and your system won’t accept either number. Hopefully agent at check in counter can resolve. | Only my boarding pass is visible, not my spouse’s. Only one of my two flights is visible without resorting to a webpage, and it fails to show the boarding pass in the app some of the time. Also, don’t ask me to review your app - I’m going to review if I want to! | When I travel because I’m on open Wi-Fi networks, I keep my VPN on. With the British Airways app, it won’t function properly or even let me login with VPN on. I had to shut VPN off to connect tp the app. Then today when I went to go grab my ticket, again, I had to shut VPN off to be able to download my ticket to my phone. I also found when I booked the flight that they had HTML tags in the message. But not before it told me there was a problem, and I would have to check back with them later. It did make the purchase for me, but I wouldn’t of known that if I hadn’t gotten a receipt an email later. I don’t think they have quality people working for their web development team – –period. Too many mistakes for the team to be quality. I can use my Delta app, Virgin app, or any other airline app and I can leave my VPN on and use it. British Airways— not the case. | Such a horrible and buggy app. Much of the functionality isn’t even in the app; it just opens a webview to the BA website. On the website there are links everywhere to download the app 😞. I’m trying to check in and it asks for passport information. I add the information. Try to check in again. Same thing - asks for passport information. 

Update: the app/website asks me to verify my contact info constantly, yet when my connection was re-assigned to another flight after a delay I was never contacted. | Keeps asking for the same info over and over again. Very frustrating. | Easy-Breezy! | Hoping to have a good outcome and will write the review then!
Thank you. | Clunky and feels very dated. Maybe take some notes from the Delta app. | The BA mobile app needs a lot of help. It is not intuitive at all and is difficult to use. The what should be simple task of adding personal information to my profile is impossible. There is no way to add a picture of my passport to my profile for advanced flight information. The app uses a combination of the website and local app making it impossible to use off-line. Take a look at the JetBlue app. They figured it out. | Awkward user interface, slow, glitches. It took 5 attempts to get my boarding pass. 

Take a look at the Delta app and make some much needed upgrades. | Can't access the mobile boarding pass for my family without downloading the app for each individual, including my children | BA is awful   Terrible customer service compared to AA and codeshare you definitely can’t count on | Very rude and condescending staff Newark airport | Prone to errors. Not intuitive. Please fire the app/website staff. | The app does not have many useful features built in - to check-in, for example, it simply opens a web browser, which was clunky and forced me to enter the same information multiple times. 

The app didn’t even have correct or updated information with respect to my itinerary, check-in/seat status, or our flight information. | Had to try the same thing multiple times to check-in. App constantly redirects to web experience. What’s the point of the app? | BA app is the absolute worst.

I have never cancelled or have any issues with them. Until this time. I contacted them few months before the trip due to my father health problem. Agoda couldn’t help anything with it because I booked the non cancellation booking. Few week after that we contacted them my father passed away. Now we planned to go for a trip (This trip is for our son). Today (before our trip 6days) my son has tested positive for Covid. I have photo of my son Covid test but the assistant never asked me for it. She says my request has denied due to my dispute. 
I had hoped that Agoda could help me better. Ask me for more information and could understand more of my situation. 
Lastly I will never booked through Agoda again and will never recommend my family and friends to use this site. Because at least another sites would give you a credit for next time booking even though it is non-cancellation booking | I recently had a dreadful experience with the GetYourGuide app (which is connected through Agoda when you try to book a tour). Despite booking a popular large group tour in Rome several weeks in advance, I inadvertently booked the same tour again for the same day. Shockingly, the app failed to notify me of this duplicate booking. Upon realizing my mistake, I immediately attempted to cancel one of the bookings, only to find out that I couldn't because the tour was less than 24 hours away.

Customer service was an absolute nightmare. Despite numerous emails and interactions with different agents, they all robotically regurgitated the same excuse: ""rules are rules."" It's clear their primary concern is protecting their own interests, even at the expense of customer satisfaction. They shamelessly lied to me about the possibility of a refund, claiming the tour provider wouldn't cooperate, only to be exposed when I reached out to the actual agency and received a prompt and courteous refund directly from them.

It's evident that GetYourGuide's customer service is severely lacking, with a dismissive attitude that suggests they believe their dominance in the market exempts them from providing quality assistance. Save yourself the headache and use alternative platforms like Booking, Airbnb, TripAdvisor, Klook, or any other service that actually values its customers. Trust me, it's not worth the hassle. | Not able to answer question and can’t even gain access to realtime or in person host access. A waste a time | Easy to use and pricing never disappoints! | Love Agoda | On 04/12/2025 I am utterly dismayed by the appalling treatment we received from both Agoda and Furama Silom Hotel during our recent trip to Thailand. Despite paying well in advance for a reservation at Furama Silom with a pool, we were shockingly informed upon arrival that our booking could not be honored due to overbooking and a supposed computer system error.

Instead of accommodating us at a comparable hotel in the Silom area, as one would expect from a reputable booking platform like Agoda, we were unceremoniously shuffled off to Furama's alternate location in Pratunam. The receptionist had the audacity to claim that this relocation was an upgrade, blatantly lying about its supposed superiority. Not only did this relocation disrupt our meticulously planned itinerary, but it also deprived us of the amenities we had specifically booked for, including the rooftop pool.

Flying all the way from the USA to Thailand only to be met with such disappointment and inconvenience is utterly disheartening. Our plans with friends were ruined, and the subpar room and atrocious breakfast included at the alternate location only added insult to injury.

While both Agoda and Furama Silom offered apologies for the inconvenience, mere words cannot undo the disappointment and frustration we experienced. It is unacceptable for a reputable booking platform and hotel to fail so spectacularly in meeting the expectations of their paying customers.

I urge fellow travelers to exercise caution when booking through Agoda and to thoroughly research alternative accommodations in case of such mishaps. As for Furama Silom Hotel, their inability to honor our reservation and subsequent lack of proper compensation only serve to tarnish their reputation further. | Until you buy a ticket from a garbage airline, in Bangkok stuck there 3 days and no end in sight. | Why you add tax, when there is no tax in Kuwait | Why not show the actual cost of the room, including all taxes and fees from the beginning.  I typically use a different website that doesn’t have any Added fees at the end. | It seems like I get good deals with this app although it constantly seems to be barraging me with coupons of various amounts and durations, to which, I’m unsure if those discounts have ever been applied.  App seems to game the prices: if you’re on the fence and leave a hotel at the book button it will come back at your with slightly better offer or ‘coupon.’ | Agoda provides efficient and excellent booking service | I tried to contact customer service during my stay. Worst ever experience. Not able to contact anyone no response at all in chat box | Very bad app. Technical glitches everywhere.. their filter criteria works perfectly fine on the search page. However, when you tap on any hotel and go to the details page, it has different price and different benefits to the customer. If you don’t notice it carefully but book it, you will end up paying a lot more at the hotel or else you will have to give up on what you expect from your stay. | Best service accident pricing, and very clear easy website. Made all  my booking this trip all with Agoda.👍 | Your best price guarantee is a horrible joke. | This is easy to use and better communication | Used this application for first time booked a room paid in advance when i got to the property my booking did not show on their system i am feeling like i was scammed | First started using Agoda nearly ten years ago. I have only used the app. for hotel reservations and only when going to Thailand, which is three to four times a year. Almost every time I have checked the prices with other sites or even checked directly with the hotel, Agoda has the best rate and guarantees it. The app. is easy to use and I have never experienced a problem. I have and continue to recommend to both family and friends! | Grate prices | 太方便了太爱了😍 | Two things I found out in my recent nasty experience with this app:

1- You end up paying more than if you were directly to the vendor. My rental car costed with Agoda $160, but I paid the rental car company $120, and same thing happened with the hotel, I paid more with Agoda than with the hotel… 

2- I paid with Agoda first online, then I went on my trip and both the hotel and car rental asked me for my card, I thought it was to charge me for the security deposit.. they charged me FOR THE SERVICE AGAIN, I over paid with Agoda and ended ip paying the vendors again… This situation has been going since February 05th, it’s April 10th and I get a daily email from Agoda saying “rest assured that we are working on your case, we havent been able to contact the hotel”… Save yourself some money, use priceline, and use site of the retailers but avoid these thieves. | Really convenience by using this app and I used this app especially for hotel booking. Effective and easy to use for everyone who loves to travel. | I travel frequently and Agoda is the best site with many discounts. So, if you want to save a little money, use Agoda! | Its good.recommendable. | 那不是不如网页版 | Easy to use. Search secure or cancel booking | Have been a long user of Agoda and they have never failed to deliver. Great experience with Agoda on price, options and customer service. | Tu | Becareful of their deals ( compared to others) unless it’s huge saving. Most of the time their deals are without breakfast. | No reserves nada en esto es malo teníamos una reserva de hotel y cuando llegamos a el hotel no mandaron ninguna reservación  y nos tuvieron 40 minutos en llamada de espera y no nos dieron ninguna solución así que si no quieres tener una frustración no reserves aqui | For some reason it took way longer than it should have to enter credit card information.  Because the screen on the mobile app jerks around and moves on its own. | Thxs for great hotel prices good information easy to use , if you don’t have this app must get | Agoda is showing reasonable options to book. But at time booking, some convenient options are not there! | First time use will see | Slaps bruh | The prices offered by Agoda are often misleading. For example, I bought a hotel room today which was listed at 1081 baht per night I plan to stay three nights so you would expect to pay about 3,240 baht. But when I clicked through to purchase, the total price was over 4000 baht. While this price was said to include taxes, there was no breakdown of what those taxes were, and why were they indicated on the front end? In short, don’t expect to pay the price listed on the Agoda website. You will invariably pay more.l

Another example of the unreliability of the Agoda website: today I was offered a 1600 bought discount if I used the designated promotion code on my booking. I booked a room with this in mind that was slightly more expensive than I would otherwise have booked. I applied the discount promo code as instructed. However, the price charged was exactly the same as if I had never input the promo code. In other words, I was not given the benefit of the proper promotion. What’s going on Agoda? Why are you defrauding your customers this way?  And especially one who is a VIP and platinum status? | I have just booked a room for 10 days in the US. I will update.

UPDATE: Check in - FLAWLESS
ROOM IS GREAT!!! 

I will be using this service over anyone else! Excellent job!!! | 항공권 예매한걸 다음날 취소했더니 수수료를 원금의 80%를 가져가는 여행사는 니들이 처음이다.

고객센터에 문의를 해도 규정상 어쩔수 없다는 식의 답변에 해외라 소송 넣기도 뭐해.. 참 제대로 된 시스템이다!

환불불가라던가 수수료를 이렇게 땔거면 보통 재차 확인이나 공지를 명시해주는게 일반적인 방법일거를 본인들이 모르지는 않을텐데 분명 이 방법으로 장사해먹는게 맛들린듯하다.

최악의 대행사 아고다, 다시는 항공권을 사지 않겠다! | Great deals, easy to navigate platform, detailed information on the hotel, very easy to use. This was a great experience, and I highly recommend it. | be aware when you book through app.

UI is not clear. I booked hotel and flight twice with same day same time!!

customer service chat is old fashioned style. 

I have to open chat window with each section. 

their was not organized.

please keep in mind, do not book through the app. Don’t be mess your vacation. | Love the deals and discounts you all find | Fast & accurate! | booked a stay for my wife, baby and a family friend. arrived at our place and couldn’t get a hold of the host, but proceeded to follow the check in instructions. keys were missing from the property so i called the host. they picked up after a few rings and hung up. i called back 10 times with no response. called agora customer support which after an hour (and at this point a screaming baby) offered to cancel my reservation. 20 business days on the refund. thanks agoda!

i ended booking a place that was 50% more expensive out of desperation.

to add insult to injury, i wrote back later insisting on writing a negative review for the property that same day no showed me, since they were a 9/10 listing.

they informed me that only people with a successfully completed stay can write reviews…welp i guess i don’t qualify. | I use this site to book a flight and after the flight was confirmed and paid for. I later received an email saying that there were changes to my flight with the booking confirmation number. However, I later tried to make changes in my return flight, the airlines told me to go to the travel agency which I did so but there's no bookings ID number, there is no customer service phone number, their online chat doesn't help and no one will not reply to the many emails that were sent. So after you book your flight, you are on your own!!! | They scam using cheap dirty motels they don’t check the the authenticity of the places they listed they are a 3rd party company so when you book thru them and something happens they have to talk to another company to talk to the hotel. I paid 143 to stay somewhere blood used tampons black mold in the room(even sent pics) ended up sleeping in my car for the 2 nights and now I’m getting the runaround from not only Agoda but the booking partner which they won’t disclose to you for a refund they only offered me 42 dollars worth of credits which isn’t nowhere near enough to book one night yet alone 2. DO NOT USE THIS SITE THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF CURRENTLY IN CONTACT WITH ALL MAJOR NEWS NETWORKS TO EXPOSE THEM FOR THE FRAUDS THEY REALLY ARE | Great | Very difficult to get the price shown that I wanted. Keep having trouble until the price raised. | They keep flagging me for fraud and when I provide photos of my card and ID with matching names, they still cancelled my booking on 3 occasions to where I had to use Expedia instead or I would have had no place to rest after driving for 15 hours. Huge disappointment with this company and their help chat is useless. I tried to call someone as well, but they couldn’t put me through to fraud prevention so there was no one to explain anything to me or give me a reason why I keep getting flagged. Never using them again for a booking. | Thank you for simplifying the reservation from USA and my visit.  My father passed away and we are here for a burial. | Hope it’s improved.  Used it many years ago and Siam Kempinski gave us what was the worst room in the hotel: run-down, dirty, crammed with broken furniture.  

Giving Agoda another chance today for Sapporo in late April.

Doesn't let you book anything. | App wouldn’t load so I updated the app. App still won’t load. | App is useful enough if you can get used to the constant prompts that you’re leaving the app for no particular reason, since the information you’re looking for is in the app (specific to “my plans”). It would be helpful for deck maps and other useful options not to be buried within the hamburger menu. Also, the check-in process is particularly painful. Really needs to be smoothed over and reorganized. | Being able to coordinate via phone and text  with my my family has been key to experiencing to great cruise!   Thank you for offering such a great deal! | The app doesn’t work half the time, which is a problem. It’s 2024 and the app is not designed for iPad… It is still an iPhone app on an iPad. | Best of the best | The cruise was already a lot of money and basically the moment you got there the start hustling you to buy stuff. But I did really like the way that they did invocation .But they chartered you a lot . The app was useful though they told you what you where doing you could do a lot with it so there. | Surprised this App isn’t a weekly subscription the way they treat you on the ship. 
App won’t work when you are on a excursion. Must be connected to ship WiFi | Constantly logs out and absolutely impossible to log back in then suddenly and unexpectedly logs in and can’t figure out why. I’ve spent hours trying to figure out why it won’t log in or re-entering my password and it’s nothing but constant, furious frustration, and definitely the definition of insanity. Absolutely hate this app. Can never log in when I need it. Never get the info I need on the ship. Nightmare!!! | So much great staff energy! We are blessed to be here! | The app is full of bugs | I never realized how much was involved with signing on for a cruise? I have the app and with all of your information there isn’t a log off on the app I could find. Why not a search in the app? They inform you of changes very well. As others have said excursions way too expensive. 

Sandra White | Only had the app for about a month and it crashes constantly! It’s the Paramount Plus of cruise line apps. | Obligated to use the App while cruising. Inconsistent connection and functionality. Could be great but it feels like something that was developed 20 years ago and they refuse to upgrade it.

Sailed Norwegian Joy in March 2024. | This app is incredibly useful if you’re going on the ship | This app is garbage. It’s practically useless | Bare minimum effort app. It’s especially noticeable when it’s the only app you’re stuck with for days on end. | I love the cruise ship except whenever I type in the correct password, it doesn’t let me type it in. I think I’ll just go in person I guess four stars for the app. | Ship is excellent except for the bathtub in our room. All staff is excellent, polite and very professional and friendly. Excursions have been horrible. I give they staff 5 stars, excursions 1 star and room 3 stars. | The app has huge glitches when you try to view packages it doesn’t show a lot of the content. Seriously not worth the data space. | I normally do not write a review of applications, if they function then I work through the app to get things done.  But in the case of the NCL app i have to admit it has not been that effective.  
Let’s start with the “email” function, you log in and see an alert number for a new email to view, all of the emails look the same and the date of the email is the day you are logged in.  You can look at each one and ta-da nothing changes.  You go back to the main menu and you still have an alert that you have emails to view.  
Selecting options, no matter where you are in the app, eating, excursions or even online check-in, you select to chose something and it immediately warns you you are being redirected to a browser, you have to “select cancel” to stay in the app.  If all actions are supposed to be in the app, why in the world would you want to go to a browser?  
Ran into issue with pre-booking where it would not allow my partner take a picture for them on their app, it was like the app I was using was blocking there’s from working.
No emails listed show packages that have been paid for on the cruise, it gives old alerts but no confirmations that you have purchased these in the app those go to your outside email, would be nice if it was all in one place. | Not happy with app or anything except food | App is always crashing when trying to use it. Can never seem to manage anything on it. | The app itself is good because it allows you to plan your cruise trip however it doesn't have much information about how to or when you could reserve for certain activities and also it keeps closing suddenly when I try to make any reservation which is very inconvenient and defeats the purpose of the app . | Great cruise line. Fifth cruise to Alaska. Love it. | I like just about everything about this app except the in app communication from NCL.  The app was great when planning my June 2023 cruise on the Joy.  Unfortunately, it’s not been helpful for planning my May 2025 cruise on Aqua.  I realize much of the information is not yet available but the internal messaging from NCL is terrible!  There is a flag daily asking for a payment or loose my reservation.  None due till Jan, 2025. There is no way to archive  or acknowledge messages.  Please see if this can be corrected. Thank you | Not very user friendly; app closes for no reason. Creating an account was a chore | Every time I open the app it logs me out completely. And even if you remember everything for the login good luck getting it to not give you an error message whenever you try. I missed a comedy show because it said it was on deck 6 when it was actually on 7. Trust nothing not even the app | I’ve used this app on all my NCL cruises and it is super glitchy. You’ll be using it and the next time you open it, it won’t work. It always tries to get you to leave the app with a pop up message. I wish they would spend some money and fix the issues. | Installed the app on my iPhone. While in the app, it suggest I download and install the app. There's no facility to delete messages, so my inbox grows without the ability to clean it up. Unimpressed! | Can not make reservations or do most of what the app is supposed to be used for and it dosent show our correct items purchased | All Good! Just bit surprised many seats in Garden Cafe are stained/dirty😮 perhaps use throw away paper type coverings ?    Also maybe put small sign on Cabin Doors, Please Close your Cabin Door Quietly…😉😚🤫   Salamat  God Bless 🙏😉 | Typed in my reservation correctly multiple times over several days and the app says it can’t find my reservation. I try again this morning and have faced several error screens with me being no closer to checking in | One would expect a world class cruise line like Norwegian to have a world class app, but such is not the case. Very often when searching and/or placing items in the cart for purchase, the app  freezes up, items appear and disappear from favorites and cart. Every time, you have to log out and then log in again. Also, much of the descriptions are full of fluff with lots of descriptive adjectives but little concrete information. Although I cannot say that this app has not been helpful in planning our cruise, but it has been very frustrating to use. And by the way, it is exactly what you’d find online which also does the same frustrating things. | I received my travel/flight info today and I’m not happy.  My group of 4 has two stops before we get to London.  I tried to arrange seat arrangements, but I couldn’t find them on AA nor British Airways. 
The times traveling and the layovers will be hard for my SN daughter, Kristin and myself.  Kristin has Systemic Sclerosis and epilepsy and she has  a hard time waiting in lines.  Se wil also have a hard time arriving in London. at 6:00 amDorene broke my femur a year ago.  I have some mobility problem.  So the fewer times I have to get off and on the better.
Also I made my payments ASAP, and Tues Feb20 my son an email that his payment was due or he would lose his reservation.  My final payment was paid near or on Jan 2nd.
I’m also unhappy that if I want an upgrade I have to bid for it.  After spending $22000.00 it would be nice to have a hot tub for Kristin and not to have pay $3000 to$5000 more.
If you would like to discuss these issues, call me at 801 712 5045.  DoreneLynch | - When user opens My Plans tab in the app, then clicks on any booked activity there is a popup message saying “Leaving the app, this link opens in a separate browser” but the link does not take me anywhere and I just have to click cancel. This happens multiple times in the same session, all throughout the app.
- During Online check-in, when opting into transportation from the cruise to the airport and searching for a flight, no results show up. | Either app crashes or logs you out all the time during my cruise. Not useful if to getting on board events. | This app was very useful to find your daily schedule, book shore excursions, see your balance, and make dinner reservations. I would give this 5 stars but the internet package needs to be improved. The price of the internet is astronomical as expected (almost $1 a minute), but sometimes you can use your minutes but not even get signal. Even simple things like messages won't load. If you don't use this app to disconnect, it will charge you an extra 8 or 9 minutes. Also all minutes are rounded down so if you have 59 seconds left, you really have 0. The best is when you can connect but then their wifi doesn't work and you cannot disconnect. That also will charge your minutes. | Internet could be better…it’s 2024 but everything else was good | Best cruise we’ve ever taken. Quality experience from beginning to end. Beautiful ship and professional staff! Treat yourself, you won’t be sorry! | Being Norwegian Cruise Line I expected a better quality app. Various things don’t quite work right eg. Creating an account from the mobile app for starters - had to use desktop computer. | Disappointing that you can not link multiple rooms to one app to make traveling in a large group easier. | Like app, bit more info will be awesome. | When I click into sections, I keep getting a pop up that says “Leaving the app. This link opens in a separate web browser”.

 If you click “ok” you’re taken out of the app to a blank website where nothing populates.

 If you click “cancel” you stay in the app. | Inability to undo, for example should you make a dinner reservation you cannot undo it.  Wife made two for the same date at the same time, cannot undo, potentially locking other people out of that slot we couldn’t fill.  Also the back button in each page is embedded at the top of each page rather than at the top but scrolls away with the page so you constantly exit the page because the app itself has a back arrow at the top embedded to remain there   Messaging is an extra fee (welcome to the new cruising norm of nickel and diming guests to death but if you have WiFi you should use normal texting with proper alerts to each others. It’s better than some cruising apps but still has interface and functionality issues. | Why can’t a trillion dollar company make an intuitive app that functions. This app is glitchy. It constantly says ‘leaving the app’ when I clearly am not. Tried to update my phone number- 3 times- it will not save. Tried to make dinner reservations- its so laggy, I made duplicate reservations because I didn’t think it saved the first one. Fix this app for my $10k cruise! Urgh. | I have been traveling Norwegian for many years on many ships, but this is day one of my current voyage on the Encore for the second time they have lost our luggage, our room keys did not function properly, we have been given wrong information about Internet access. And for the first time ever-  I have encountered callous indifference to our concerns. This is not the Norwegian experience I have been accustomed to after many trips. My family is scheduled on a cruise in April, I am strongly considering seeking an alternative cruise line as a result of this as I recommended Norwegian to my family, and do not want them to encounter this type of service. Norwegian has obviously gone downhill. Loyal member who is reevaluating options. | Like your app, love your ships. We did cheat on you and tried 4 other companies, but we’re back introducing family to cruising on the Epic!",4.80633,90917,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/30/1b/05/301b055e-7490-d0d6-2999-1497728ea66e/mzl.ppghiiib.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/2e/95/cd/2e95cd30-5e63-0420-e8bd-52648cdfe600/mzl.xmaleion.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/7f/c1/5a/7fc15a31-32ef-6319-7100-e8d03c389221/mzl.rfcnjhrm.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/52/2b/17/522b17ea-2bae-c772-6b4e-e152ebf80b2e/mzl.qeigwwve.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/8b/ed/87/8bed874d-18f0-d4d0-812e-9e0fdbecf4b6/mzl.aoiebhxb.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I use it multiple times as I am with a local search and rescue team a Mountain search and rescue team and it’s been an excellent resource for finding land ownership before we start trespassing across. We know who to call when we’re searching for lostor injured individuals up in the mountains and it also has good trail markings so it’s pretty easy to follow very intuitive and it’s overall great product | Why do the fonts keep showing as ... I shouldn't have to change my font size for my entire phone just to be able to read track milage or weather temperatures. Please fix so the font auto sizes to be readable. It makes your app much less usable and makes me question if I want to re-up another year or find a more useful tool. | I’m an older gentleman and in the past I would avoid going off-road to far, because of my lack of confidence when navigating trails and getting lost. The older I get, the more I question my abilities. I’m no good navigating with a gps or any other kind of technology, and tried many ,only to be frustrated time after time, after all I was taught paper maps , it’s all we had. I looked at Onyx and downloaded the app, once again expecting to delete after a few attempts, as I’ve done with many others. I used the Tracking feature and loved it. That alone was worth it for me. I watched a few videos about route building, offline maps etc. and am getting much better with it. It’s easy and extremely accurate. I have regained my confidence in my navigating skills and can’t wait for this years trip out west. Thanks you guys/gals, my future trips look much brighter! | Use it all the time. Saved my butt a couple times with downloaded maps. | All around great app. Super easy to use. You can make your own trails, and find a lot of ways to connect existing trails. Access to the offline maps is the most handy thing! | I have used ONX for over a year and after using other apps this is my first choice. The best thing about it is the newest update that rates each trail and road by using color coding. While using another app I was led unknowingly into a trail near Moab, Utah called Pritchett Canyon. This trail is WAY beyond my skill level and I was very lucky to get through uninjured. With ONX the same trail is clearly marked in red which tells me it is extreme. On the other app it was indicated exactly the same as the road I traveled on with my motorhome, so I had no way to know how extreme it was. This kind of mistake will never happen while using ONX. I am a happy user of ONX forever. The customer service is also great. They have a phone number on their site,(unlike most other apps), and you speak to a real person almost as soon as it rings. This is a great app well worth the money. | This app is very easy to use and has a lot of embedded information. 
There is one improvement I would like to see.  When using your iPad in landscape the menu selections are not accessible. You have to remove the device from the holder and turn it to portrait. Please make them visible in landscape, then it would be a 5 star app. | When I found myself alone 20 miles off the grid, the On X trail map was pinpoint accurate with current imagery and well marked forks in the road. Having this on hand for offline could literally be a lifesaver if you find yourself separated or need to wayfind through backcountry. I think in many respects better than a GPS because of all the notes from recent trail users. | I wrote the technical support group on a question and they responded very quickly. | I recommend to anyone who is an outdoorsman | It takes a beat to figure out how to use it but once you do you will be happy with the expenditure. I like using the web version for planning (i.e establishing routes and waypoints for camping) then export to .gpx and import to my Garland XL Overland device which has a tablet size screen. I’m able to manage all of that from my smartphone. | Best app for finding dirt bike trails and recording tracks. Had it for over a year now and absolutely love it. I also use if for snowmobiling. They are coming out with some great stuff too lately I highly recommend this app. | This app really helps plan off road routes with ease. | Love being able to discover trails that I didn’t even know existed with reviews, grades, and even pictures. Sure helps planning adventures. | I’m in the back country with no cell service or WiFi a lot of time. OnX has literally been a life saver at times with being able to easily download an offline map that is showing my location keeps me oriented and being able to easily save waypoints and tracks is great for getting back out of an area or going to the same location again. Trust me take the time to check out OnX. | Great mapping app, love the ease of use and the highlighted maps and areas of interest, I use it constantly.  Best part is the team is always adding new trails and features.  Keep up the great work! | Been using the app for a couple years no without issue. Recently it has stopped loading when out of cell service. It never use to do that. I’m unsure if it is a phone software issue or app, but paying for something that doesn’t work for the purpose of which you bought it for is frustrating. It’s not an issue with the maps, the app itself will not load. It just remains on the opening screen and sits there. Only way I’ve worked around this is to try and remember to launch the app before I lose service and to not close it out. PITA. | Beware, this app has a ton of issues synching with car play.  OnX says it is aware of the problem but doesn’t have a fix yet | Love it! Honestly the best Mapping tool out there! I got the Elite! Membership is the way to go! | Love how I can put it on my truck monitor through apple car play | I love it. Nuff said. | 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 | I tried On X and its competitors pretty extensive. Came back to On X because it’s easy-to-use yet has all the important features you need to research, plan, and use the app on-the-fly in the field. I love having ONE integrated map layer that provides all the key info I need. Some powerful features like trail difficulty color-coding on the map is amazing. The support and development resources being provided by On X is the separator between this and all competitors. Thank you and keep up the amazing work On X team! | Appreciate your help in getting onX working on my phone. Thank you | I’m not a huge fan of technology especially learning new apps. OnX has been great at being user friendly. I’ve traveled thousands of miles using it and do not regret one bit. | We use OnX throughout our ranch to mark our trails and other areas on the ranch. It makes it so convenient for our family members to be able to get around the ranch confidently and safely. We couldn’t do without it. | I have a premium subscription and I can’t access the app pass the loading screen. I don’t think this app works on newer iOS devices. | I’m currently using to find local off-road trails, and its great! | Works really well | After not having used the app in a while, I pulled it up to look up a route I was interested in. The app now just loads the splash screen and never makes it further. Have deleted + reinstalled the app, restart phone, etc to no avail. Is the mobile app not supported anymore? Gave two stars because I enjoyed it in the past, but it appears useless now | Great app | I have been using OnX for almost a year and have been loving it for Off-Roading! | It is my primary offroad app. Really phenominal, expecially offline. OnX support is beyond excellent. No hassle, instant response and personable customer service reps. There are a lot of off road apps but if you dont have on x offroad, hunt or backpack, your missing out. The ability to identify the land your on, eapecially overlanding, this is invaluable. | It’s been exciting to follow the development on the ONX off-road app.  It is ABSOLUTELY  the best off-road map app available today! | We really enjoy this mapping system, allows preplanning of routes in an offline mode! | Super easy to use for a novice!!! | Planning a overland trip across the UP of Michigan.  All the logistics to the trip I have found I can find and plan on OnX.  Great app and have been using OnX hunting app for years.  Solid plat form easy to use and very reasonably priced.  Thanks to OnX off-road. | App advertises you can find trails near you but doesn’t actually show near any of the trails. I live in northern CA and there’s probably thousands of trails within 100miles yet can barely find much of any of the ones I already know about. Got the app for Dirtbike trail riding hoping to get an experience like All Trails app for hiking but this is nowhere near that. Seems like the only user input/photos are coming from a small amount of jeep guys in the area. Overall just pretty disappointing, can’t even save trails to a list? Weird. The only useful feature may be the tracking feature to make your own trails or private land info but that’s not the advertising that brought me in. | Great app | Got invited twice to become a trail guide, twice I decided, after interaction, to not help. Their guide interaction is rude, their concept of what kind of photos they want is “fluffy” and “feel good”, facts are many trails are dirty and tough not trails that should be encouraged by “sexy” photos of sunsets. 
OnX is where it’s at right now, but they open themselves up for competition by the way they treat their subscribers. | Have been enjoying it and found some great places to ride all around the states thanks again not used it yet but plan to soon | I use this for tracking horseback riding, dirt biking, mountain biking and hiking!!!! Not really sure how I lived without it. This made my adventures better because I can go farther and be confident in my location. I have also used it to keep track of all my unmarked trails so I can go again. It also tracks when I’m in the woods with no cell service and I can download the maps! | Greatest App you can download if you love hitting trails don’t sleep on it 35+ for a year is a give away | I have used both OnX hunting and OnX Offroad and both are very useful tools when you are in the outdoors and thanks for continuing to make great improvements to the app. | Amazing. | I don't know how to describe my disappointment.
The app didn't save any tracking data neither does it track on the map in real-time.
Not going to renew my subscription.
Boooooohhhhhh!! | What a easy and very robust and functional product to use.  I also love the fact that there are continuous updates!! | The app will not open today for some reason. Never had this problem. I love this app usually. Very handy for work to find property lines when clearing land | I think this is a great app. I have been a staunch GPS user for trail riding in our UTV but I have been enjoying many of the features in this App. | We went looking for a particular trail in Southern California, and could not find the trailhead so downloaded this app. We proceeded to drive at least four hours in. Then the real problem came. No cell service and trails going every which way. No idea how to get back and no one around. Getting dark and cold. Another rig rolled down the cliff, laying on its side. Nobody in it. Scared the —- out of us. This app put a blue line on the map, just like we were navigating to Starbucks in town! Rookie mistake by a self proclaimed rookie, but I would highly recommend that you download this before you go exploring. Our bodies would probably still be out there being eaten by birds if I didn’t have it! :-) I don’t know if there are other similar options, but this one works great for me, so I’m keeping

Now it won’t open without my paying. | Downloaded then they demand $5.99 a week. Ridiculous | I opened this weather app I’ve had for years and it’s now asking for payment.?? | Said it would be 70’s….didnt get much above 50. Dressed for the temperature & froze all day | Good But Not Great. It’s good but like sometimes it will tell you to buy the membership over and over and it gets annoying but anyways, It tells you the weather for the next 5 days. So I would recommend this app! | Nope! | I’ve enjoyed this program since I started using it quite a while ago and just found out they raise the price $50 a year. Talk about a rip off. Keep your current customers at the same rate they were paying don’t rip them off like they’re you’re trying to right now, no longer gonna use your program. There are so many better ones out there. Weather Channel is even better. | I have the pro subscription and the auto detect location stopped working a few updates ago. I made sure location services etc where all turned on but it still didn’t work. I sent in a help request and get back an auto reply that if I don’t respond or if my question is answerable in the FAQ there would be no response. For 69.99 a yr I expect better customer service. I have 8 months left on my subscription but I have cancelled the auto renewal. This app is no longer worth the price. | It was saying it was going to rain today but it was sunny and extremely hot | Everything in this app costs money. Nothing is free. You can’t do anything until you purchase a subscription. | I’ve been a fan and subscriber of the app for some time, however now I’m told my subscription fee is going up 250%……what?  Expect to lose many subscribers/users, including me. | Not sure why downloading is free if they want $12 a month | I’ve had this all and trusted it for years.  In the past week or so I’ve noticed it’s no longer tracking my exact location.  It’s miles off, a city or two.  What happened? | For over a year or maybe 2 year I’ve been paying $19.99 a year now you what to increase my year price $50.00 are you nuts | In that past 2 months the home screen widget is ugly, support is unresponsive, the developer has changed, and the annual subscription went from 9.99/year to 59.99!! | I’m reporting this to the FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | I wouldn’t bother unless you want to pay. Everything has an upgraded version, OK. But anything you click on is referred to upgrading and paying a subscription. No thanks. PASSSSSSSS | This app was working fine till this term of service message came up and asked to confirm something and now it won’t go away. I hit the button over Andover and nothing happens.  Screen just stays there! | Been an annual member for years, super simple to use. My favorite part/useful feature was the ability to configure what weather parameters to display on the widget. ZERO problems during that time. Few weeks ago, can’t use the app cause of a “policy update” pop up that does nothing since the Accept button does the exact same...nothing. Hold it, spam it, gesture it. NOTHING. Then the significant increase in prices?!! AYFKM?? I just can’t do it..sorry...deleted...
2 stars cause the time together🤷🏻‍♂️😘🤦🏻‍♂️👋🏽 | WARNING! TRACKS YOUR DATA! | I was just notified that this App is going to $59.99 a year to use. That's just too costly for me | I love this app. It is useful and reliable. I hope you’d consider an app for Mac. I’d like to replace my current weather app because it’s UI is not as good as yours. Edit 2: please fix the widget border. Don’t mess up the app. See my original post above for reasons that you shouldn’t mess up.  Edit 3: just read Privacy Policy.  I have funny feeling about this. Uninstalling this app 😕 Glad you send a pop up warning to read before I accept or not. Let us know when you change your Privacy policy and I’ll reconsider adding it back. | The widget is ugly and I don’t see a way to change it but the app itself is good. I won’t continue use though after the free trial ends because I won’t be using the widget. | For whatever reason the AppleTV version of the app stopped functioning and no longer it's able to get updates. Was the most useful app for my TV I have. Please bring it back! | you are the best | Awesome application I LOVE IT !!! | Size - 466 mb is too large.  Can this cut down to 300ish? | Fantastic app | Just opened the app to see there is a new policy you have to accept or brick the app, you have no other choice. Read the Privacy Policy. The amount of personal information they track on you is disturbing. Your name, real word identity, online alias’, geolocation, tracks your purchases…among a host of other invasive items. And i PAY for that privilege. Screw that, you should be paying your Users for all of their personal information. I am deleting this app immediately and making sure it does not automatically renew when it is set to do so in April.  Absolutely do not use this app! | Please fix your widget. I am only offered one and it looks horrible with a white frame around it. | This developer will capture everything about you. Everything you do everything you say everything you think about probably and use it however they feel like.
I'm deleting it from all my devices. This is insane. | Just canceled my subscription. Widgets looking weird. Please fix. Might re subscribe. | it’s ok. I switched when the Weather Channel app changed its format. It doesn’t update often enough. And sometimes gives me completely wrong weather.  Keeps closing now when I click on a certain time of day.  So, good job there. | I’ve been using this app for awhile and it’s been my favorite weather app to date! My only gripe is that recently on the Home Screen widget, there’s now a black border around it and it won’t go away. Try deleting the widget, deleting the app and reinstalling, all to no avail. Please fix it issue! | A few days ago I noticed that your weather app which I have on my iPhone 12Pro Home Screen suddenly is too small for the widget box it goes inside of so it doesn’t look very good. You see an offset white box behind the actual app which is the box the widget fits into. Also, March 10th is there twice with 2 different forecasts. Will these bugs be fixed soon? | Loved this app and suddenly the widget is missized?  Half fits with a partial white border?  Please fix as I really don’t want to find a new app. | The latest update is not functioning well | The widget is not complete in the frame. It is in a rectangle area instead of taking the full area of the widget. Hence I have like a white frame around. Any idea? | New update messed up with widget which now has black bars on weird corners | So I’ve been using this app a long time and it’s pretty good. It does crash quite a bit, especially if you click the widget to get to the app. It’ll freeze up and crash. Also, the widget has a weird white trim that clashes with my background. Take that away please. | i look at this every day!! love the backgrounds!!! great at updating and has the weather that my current location is at!!!!! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️🤓🤓🤓😘😘✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼 | The app is good. However an update recently made the widget have a black border which not only doesn’t look good but squishes all of the text together. Fix that and it will be 5 stars | Es muy precisa,me encanta su diseño | I enjoy using this app as it has a long range forecast. | Good | This feature really excited me since I am photographer. It is very nice and capable app.

Trust no other ;) | I subscribed for one year and put up with having to spend hours downloading different regions every time there was an update. The visual acuity for the maps themselves is poor, especially when comparing them to other like apps available. 

After purchasing a new iPad, the subscription wouldn’t transfer. I contacted customer support and got little assistance and a response that my email didn’t show a subscription. I then sent a screen shot of my App Store Subscriptions, which clearly showed that I had a subscription to customer support and didn’t receive any response. Such a waste of time. I canceled my subscription and now use another service. The concept is good, the actual map quality and support is terrible. | From the US to Africa, this app gives me the confidence to drive internationally. | Es el mejor mapa | This use to be my favourite map app that I would use without WiFi. This is no longer the case I find the mapping without WiFi is bad and pinpoint location not to be accurate. I don’t recommend using or buying this app. I have been using this app for more than ten years and have pinpoints everywhere I traveled to. I’m going to need to transfer all of these points to a different mapping app. | Now it says you have 10 free map downloads remaining when you go to download a map. Used to be unlimited. | I’ve recommended this app to literally hundreds of people. I used the turn by turn in Australia on CarPlay, speed indicator on the train in Italy, and downloaded many maps of areas I planned to visit on vacation or hiking in the wilderness. — Now every one of those features costs a monthly subscription. I get making money, but removing features and placing them behind a monthly pay wall is a sure way to change the opinions of long time users. How many monthly subscriptions is a person supposed to have? Disappointed. | Lo mejor en mapas sin conexión | The user can’t look up a specific address and set it as their destination. I guess the app uses specific coordinates or something. Either way it wasn’t worth the money I mistakenly forked up and Apple never gets tired of denying refunds (especially when the trial ended less than 12 hours ago). I’m not going to use a gps app that won’t let me set a specific address as my destination. | I was lost in Venice arriving late at night. GPS did not work couldn’t get a signal, but MAPS.ME was clear as a bell. | Realities of hiring new management I assume. For years I kept records of my trips with pins here. Flying over Greenland I could get a gps signal. On a ship in the inside passage so I could see where we went. But when I flew to a new place I would pay for a while. Keeps getting harder to deal with this app. | This used to be a fantastic free app. Maybe if they charged a reasonable one time fee it would be okay, but no way am I going to pay monthly for it. Two more of my favorite apps also went this way and I deleted them all together. | شكرا جزيلاً | This app died and was replaced by another app called Organic Maps. Same original developers when this app was good and wasn’t bought by corporate greedy shills | This is the best app for hiking and navigating trails. I got lost in hiking in Iceland once (which is fun, until it’s not) This app has map of the area I was hiking saved me from panic. | Why your good App dosn’t support older version
Please help us to update my iPhone 6 ios 12.5 same as before
Tanks in advance | I use Maps.me for years because of its ability to download maps for off-grid use. The new subscription model kills it. Too greedy. | Worldwide success! | الله شاهد افظل برنامج بالخرائط MAPS.ME برنامجي المفظل | Great tool .. most valuable trip companion for over 4-5 years | لكن يجب ان يبقى البرنامج مجاناً لتقديم الخدمات للمجتمع | I can't believe this app is better than Google maps in terms of navigating | هليمكنكم  ان يكون النطق في الغه العربيه | Works even in some remote places. Best map I’ve ever had | Best | اول ممتاز ولكن الحين مايصلح | Maps.me is a very useful app
I've been using it for several years without Internet signal, or even on the plane
I like it very much | I bought the app twice. Now I suggest buying it for the third time! | The app used to be highly functional with a superior UI. Now it’s focused on monetization, extremely slow when searching,  and completely full of annoying glitches.

You ruined a good thing. | 静安区体育中心明显不对，已经搬到汶水路了 | Paid $10 for it in 2013 and used it for 11 years before deleting it after pay structure was introduced. Anyone looking for an offline map app should use organic maps instead. | تطبيق سهل وسلس و جباااار | Very easy accessible, helpful up to date reliable navigation tool ! | In this part of the country there are regions where online service is not available. maps.me is a great solution to trip navigation in these regions. Thanks for providing your valuable resource. | I love that the app is free to use, and it’s offline which is amazing. But the monthly subscriptions is too expensive. I have another offline map that offers subscriptions, & they do not cost as much as this one.

If you would cut down the price of the subscription I will subscribe. 👍 | Maps.me used to be the best app for offline maps. Then they started charging a pretty hefty subscription price AND hid a lot of their features behind that paywall. 

Really shady business practices from these devs. I highly recommend checking out Organic Maps instead. It’s like maps.me before it went downhill. | Better than google map. | Great product. Perfect maps and abundant connected information. A lifesaver when connection to the internet is spotty. | 免费下载10张太少 | ديالى | My account just disappeared even I paid for whole year | Helpful app 👍🏼 | Descontaron 55 USD de mi tarjeta porque olvidé cancelar la suscripción al probar los 3 días gratis de la app , que por cierto me trajo un gran descontento ya que la versión pro no tiene nada de magnífico , solicité un reembolso y no fueron capaces de ayudarme | This app was great in Curacao but in Aruba instead of sending us to the national park, it literally lead us to the middle of nowhere. Can’t entirely trust it unfortunately. | Most positive reviews are outdated | No map of New Mexico that I can find. Well, search doesn’t find it anyway, and I’m not scrolling through the hundreds of maps to figure out it’s included with some other map set. If search can’t find it, I have to assume it doesn’t exist. Search found Colorado… | Hi Chi Minh City great way to get around | Very helpful | Excelente | Once upon a time this was a good app but since it was bought by a Russian company they began charging for features more and more. Now you have to pay to load more than 10 maps, and all the maps I had previously loaded are not available. You can get the same (or probably better) at no cost from the original creators who have a fork of the app called OrganicMaps.

You just click and you then do nothing. Also very controlling. So yeah this is a honest review | no es nada de lo que promete en la portada se ven granos y cuando lo tienes es un hotel lo odio nunca lo usen 🤬😡 | I have played this game for quite awhile until now. I purchased some gems to upgrade the cleaning. I left the game to wait for upgrade time and when I returned the upgrade disappeared. I contacted customer support on the game and haven’t heard anything. I will be disputing the charge for the gems since I didn’t get the upgrade! This game and customer service is a complete joke!! | The game overall is fun, but there are way too many options for events, mini games and objectives. In my opinion, it’s overwhelming and the mini games and events are sometimes very irrelevant. For example, the doctor mini games, the pet you have to take care of, an aquarium, and other collectibles plus events… it’s a lot, I lose track. 

It’s a good game for folks who prefer variations. | NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED 
Idk why the app logo is an eye because the game is about building a hotel. | The games not like the pics | I like this game because it is fun and challenging | I’ve been trying for two weeks to play hotel craze but when I hit the app it just keeps like it’s loading up and don’t….im up on high levels and been playing it for couple years be a shame if I have to get rid of it cause I love playing it….. and not had a update on this game for awhile | I have played this game for a long time and I do enjoy it. The updates are so slow for new levels. I think this last one has been close to a year now. I know it takes time but waiting on new levels this long is crazy. | Love | So FUN | It’s been like this for awhile, can you change it back to the hotel background like it was? Game was fun. | This game is soo complicated,also the graphics look almost TO fake 👾, “is this game supposed to be satisfying” cuz it’s NOT!
I don’t know if you can help with this but… again it’s soooooooo complicated especially the tutorial, it’s almost to tutorial-y,the add I saw about this game LIED, I would rather it be JUST a spa not a hotel too, like what’s the purpose bestie?!

But seriously what’s the purpose of this game?👋 | This is the most boring game ever it is not what if say it is it’s a hotel not a doctor office and way to many adds | At first I downloaded this game for the pimple popping, but that’s just one side feature of this game. I found the actual hotel  management part to be the most intriguing. There’s no ads, unless you choose to watch one for free items. It’s really fun and I highly recommend! | Wooooo el juego es súper divertido nada más que se pone un poco difícil en el nivel 12 en adelante
Y e gusta mucho que tenga doble juego en uno. | I think every 2 rounds you should get 1/4 of a boost | No tiene nada que ver con lo que sale en la foto | It is so fun and it gives you something to do and it helps you if you want to be a doctor or work at a hotel so yeah | Absolutely nothing like the advertisement do not download this game you will just be disappointed | I love it so much I wish I can do it all the time but I’m a kid I spent hours and hours playing this game. Thank you for making this game. Maybe you should make a romantic game about this please keep making more. Thank you. | RICE | No matter what I do I can NOT pass level 13. I've gotten all of them correct and I just CANT get 282 coins. | I love this game it so satisfying and fun to play | This is totally a 7+ game.i just love it im so addicted to this game more than any other game i have. There is so much to do. | To be honest, this game is pretty addicting and to get started I’m just gonna say the stuff I like about this game so the main thing I like about this it doesn’t have any ads and also it’s a no Wi-Fi game. You can play on the airplane. This game is really really fun and addicting. I played this for five hours straight without even noticing, so yeah, but one thing I don’t like about the game is like they make you watch tutorials without like showing you how to do it because sometimes they get annoying when you don’t know what to click, but it keeps popping up and yeah, but overall I like this game and I would recommend getting this warning if you don’t like to be patient, I recommend not to get this game | Please update this game with new hotels. | I don’t really like this game because it seems like the people are getting mad at you there are so many adds but there not it is really time consuming I fill like I have been hotel crazed out but it can be fun just not what it says it would be like especially this version ,. | Love the game But after the last update The app icon shows hotel craze with like pimple popping and you don’t get the bonus in the game anymore. Where you get like a day daily bonus and every seven days you get all of the boosters please fix this. | I decided to download this after looking at the pictures only to find a stupid hotel game. Thanks for lying to me | This game is a lie it’s not what it said I was it’s a candy crush game don’t believe the ads or nothing is just a big scam would not recommend unless u like candy crush | It’s been almost a year since any new hotels have been added. How much longer before a new hotel is ready? | I don’t like how many ads are there and if you don’t have patients like me then I would not consider | This game is tricking you | This game is so so so so so not fun it doesn’t even make any sense everything it does is serve food and drinks and also you just clean up rooms and so far I HAVE CLEANED EAR HOLES AND MOUTHS that’s so disgusting | I literally count the likes and watch the game not count it so to me it cheats. Why? So you’ll have to buy something or watch a dozen ads. I’m not spending money to pay to win a game. You’ve lost me. | I love this game because it is interesting and really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really FUN🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩and it helps you know that you are faster than you think. And it has like 0 ads | Finished the game. Waiting on next level… | I hate how it is very different in the adds then in the game it is so annoying and it’s so stressful and really boring. | I used to really enjoy this game, but I stopped playing it since it changed its icon to the gross bodily bacteria stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with the game. Yuck! | Ok I have a list 1.the game is literally the same thing over and over again
2.the pictures are from a whole different game
3.all you do is clean teeth, pop pimples, and that’s literally it 

In conclusion, I don’t recommend getting this app it could be better but this is just my I opinion. | 这么久了不更新新酒店么？？ | Been months and completed all levels nothing new has come out. No new hotels | If you hate scams then don’t download this bc all it is  is that  the pimples and blood and pus and wounds ect is mini games so don’t download it a hotel game and the  quality it useless DONT DOWNLOAD THIS | This game is so fun. It’s challenging and it has two things for you to do. You get to help people clean their mouths or ears and you get to take care of your own hotel. This game is amazing and I recommend playing it. Ever since I got the game I couldn’t take my eyes off of it because it was so fun, challenging, and I loved that you even get to help people. But my only criticism is that when I got to help people clean their ears and other stuff all I did was tap. I wish their was more detail and that we don’t have to just tap the circle. Other than that the game was lovely. I love this game. It’s challenging, amazing, interesting, fun, and involves a lot of strategy and skill. This is the best game I have ever played. | this is a fun game but the process of the game moves really slow. when you are in the office working on patients, the simulation moves really slow. if you have a lot of time on you hands or just bored, play this, but if you are impatient, don’t. i like playing it because it’s fun and simple. | Iv been waiting for an update for quite a while now!! Pls have a new hotel already!! Otherwise I like the game! Pls update!! Getting tired of waiting for them! Where I the new hotel?? Come on! | I’ve been playing this game for a while and I don’t mind watching ads to get right rewards . But why do you keep having the fish aquarium challenge? If you don’t have a new fish tank for us to put the fish in. | I don’t know why this game decided to change its logo to some worm crawling out of an eye which has nothing to do with this game.

Never disappointed!! | Two teenage daughters and myself- so we have about every shape, need and nit-picketiness imaginable! But CUPSHE has delivered. Super cute cuts that are just a hint of sexy to sporty and supportive tops. The bottoms all fit as described and the materials are good quality! Lots of beach, spike ball wave crashing and pool chilling!
Customer service is nice and helpful but difficult to get returns exchanges processed. Grab a measuring tape and really think about your order to hopefully avoid returns. They’re working on themselves! | I downloaded the cupshe app which stated 20 percent off my first order. upon making my first order of almost 700 dollars the discount code only took off 40 dollars from my order. I contacted cupshe via the app using their messenger system. The representative told me that there was nothing they could do to adequately give me my 20 percent off. I then put in for a phone call request which they have on the site where you can choose when to have a representative call you about your order. I never received a phone call. I will be returning my entire order upon its arrival. I cannot justify purchasing clothes from a company that doesn’t care about their customers and that falsely advertises discounts . | But hard to use the sales and coupons | I tried out Cupshe this year by ordering a cute bikini. When I received it, I was so impressed with the quality! I was hooked! Since then I have placed a couple more orders. I am usually impressed with the quality of the items I receive from Cupshe. Love how they have cute clothing that I can’t find anywhere else! I really appreciate the good sales they offer as well! | Why have a 2x choice and only have maybe 6-10 max shirts available? Waste of my time to even download very disappointed | 3-5 business days express delivery turned into a FULL 3 WEEKS. Received my order and everything is just okay. Very wish.com ish for quality of the clothes. The bathing suits are nice, but not worth waiting 3 weeks for. Dreading the return process from what others have said. They clearly don’t care about the shopping experience from start to finish; they just want to make the sale. | CUPSHE bathing suits are the BEST! The quality is amazing and they look great. They’re comfortable and have the right amount of coverage. I’ve ordered several times from them and they’re always great! | I just made a purchase after giving away my address, email address, AND phone number because it said 20% off first purchase- but of course I received no email, nor did the discount apply at the checkout. Not happy | The promotional discount codes don’t work and typing in the search bar is laborious and barely works, as well. | I ordered 6 outfits for an upcoming vacation. Ending up keeping half. The other outfits either fit off or the material was too thin. It was super each to return. I will order again because it was so simple. Shopping online can be such a headache. Love when I find somewhere that takes the hassle out of it. | Love this app!!!! | I did t get to put my discount code in on my first order. | Had to make returns and it was simple and easy. | I tried to click pay now or whatever and it deleted my entire bag and then told me my order was canceled twice and didn’t give any help on how to fix it and obviously I didn’t remember everything I had in my cart and I still don’t cause it was a lot and I doubt checked all the information was correct even tho it didn’t even say that that was the problem I still don’t know what happened | When choosing an item to purchase, the image of the item is no longer shown. Clothing sites show several views of the clothing piece. The image is not visible when you click on an item | I ordered two swimsuits and based on the measurements, I ordered large for both. One fit well in all the right places, but the other ( blue ) was quite tight. Since I am in the process of losing weight I’m hoping it will eventually fit me, but it may be one of those suits ( based on its particular style and cut) that just doesn’t fit comfortably enough to wear. :( | Awful company. | This is the epitome of fast fashion, and is very obviously cheaply made. I would never recommend this app or their products. You get what you pay for! 

The return process is awful. If you accept a coupon in lieu of a refund, and buy other items, nothing is returnable per their policy.

I bought 15 things, 1 item actually fit and now I’m sending it all to Goodwill which is terrible for the environment, plus I’m out $200. | I just love the clothing everything fits perfectly.. | I’ve ordered a couple times from CUPSHE. The swimming suits are great quality and super cute. | This app needs work. Typing in the search item didn’t work I had to voice text to get it to work. One item it kept saying invalid but on my laptop was there. Then it said I qualified for free shipping but then charged me $27.00 to ship. Not sure if I will ever order from this company again. Don’t promise free shipping and then charge me for it. | App is overall good and CUPSHE has great bathing suits. The only problem is when you try to filter by a certain size, it doesn’t work. It will show out of stock bathing suits and ones that don’t even come in the size you’re looking for. | Love love love! ❤️ ❤️❤️ | Easy to use, love the extra bonus coupons that pop up | I love this online boutique! Everything is so darn cute and affordable. The swimsuits are my favorite and they don’t cost an arm and leg. So, thank you for that 👙👗😎 | CUPSHE promises sooo many promotions through email and even on their actual app that are inaccessible.  I spent forever trying to access promised sales. It was so frustrating.  It all feels like a scam. | True to size dresses .. | Love the style even thoug Mayetial used is poor quality | I have been buying my daughters and nieces swimsuits from you for years!!!  They are always great quality and pricing!!! | I made a purchase almost 4 weeks ago and still have not received. When I go in the chat it just gives me automated answers. When I try to call no one every picks up. I ordered these items to take on my vacation in 17 days. This is ridiculous. They won’t give me a refund or stop the order either. I won’t be ordering g from this site again. | Go to for all summer looks | Very disappointed that my item has been in NY for over 2 weeks with no update since..still waiting for item purchased 3 weeks ago! | Pretty upset, was hoping to get the stuff by spring break. Ordered a month early. Items have been in ready to ship status for three weeks and still have not shipped. | Just started purchasing my beach wear from CUPSHE. Absolutely Love my items. I’ve ordered a couple of times in the last month & I love the quality of the clothes & swimwear. Totally satisfied. Most importantly, I finally found a trusted place to buy my beachwear. So stylish. Love it. | Just received 3 bathing suits I ordered and they all fit great. Sizing guide was accurate! arrived quickly. Look forward to the rest of my order. | I have loved every single bathing suit I have ordered here they make you feel so good while in them! I recommend to anyone that compliments them! | I should’ve read reviews before placing my order - whereas the tops look cute , they don’t look the same or fit small. And as I’m trying to return it keeps telling me m6 order number does not exist HELP | Cupshe has the best customer service in a company I’ve ever experienced especially with returns. The app is very user friendly. You can chat with customer service. These swimsuits are great quality at a fraction of the price. I just spent over $120 on one swimsuit that I’ll be returning because I bought 5 Cupshe suits for that price and they are higher quality and way better fit. Shipping is quick only a few days. I’ve requested a return before on one that just didn’t fit my body right and they let me keep the suit and get credit for a new one! I love that there are review photos of real people. | I could not change my address before submitting my payment | Best company ever! Great fit, great quality, and great customer service! | I ordered 4 bathing suits they’re SO well made ! Very very flattering ! I highly recommend buying from this site my only complaint is one bathing suit  is too big and returns seem almost impossible I see no option to return so I’m a bit discouraged ! But again the bathing suits themselves are really amazing and high quality! Just be weary of retuning them if you need to ! | The best clothes and outstanding customer service!! | Received my order and loved them all but one. Customer service was amazing and I received my replacement in a week. Cupshe is my go to for all my vacation and summer needs! | The shipping was within normal range. The clothes were good quality. I wanted a return on some clothes and the process was easy. So far Cupshe has not disappointed. | My favorite bathing suits they always for perfectly and look great and feel great and good prices! | Pretty sure by now 90% of my swim suites are from Cupshe. I love all of them, they’re good quality for the price and cute. I wish there were a bit more styles with cup support, sometimes the tops take a little adjusting or don’t round out as good as they could in top, for the girls. But other than that love what I have. I’ve also lost a lot of weight and was unsure of size this season but whatever I needed to return because I was wrong was easy and simple. I also have some cover ups and dresses from them, all I have liked and decent quality. | It was my first purchase with this company and the last one. I never received my order | OMGOSH!!!

We’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it!

• Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals
• Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings

• Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits

The fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).

This is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq

You’re better off with the Pricelines of the world. One of the worst if not the…. | Great service!!!! | Bought ticket to La from Chicago but rejected at airport because didn't have passport. Original destination was Guatemala which is international flight! And requires passport wasted my whole day! Then offered to make change on my ticket which was $335 extra on top of what i have paid(((( at least they could have warned me that this flight might require a passport! I do not carry passport since i am traveling within states only! Went to airport at 4 am for nothing, what a waste this app is! No customer support either all they recommend is airline support | Never fails me!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Busqué por toda la web y no podía encontrar este gran vuelo !! Gracias son geniales | Always! | Hands down they have the best flights 100% of the time! | I CAN NOT BELIEVE THESE AWESOME PRICES!!! I am blown away!!! I will be flying away more often. Thank you Skiplagged!!! | Makes it so easy and best prices. Thx. | Easy fast now too relax Thank U | I haven’t told any of my friends about this website because I am worried that if more people use it the price will go up. Love this app! | Hice una reserva y al día siguiente lo intenté cancelar xq al reservarlo me descontaron inmediatamente y no me hicieron reembolso la pero aplicación que hay | I’m new to the app I’ve always paid full price from American for my flights ! With money being a little more tight I decided to expand my horizons and fly whatever was the cheapest haha. My friend referred me to this app and I’m so in love and I’m telling everyone haha 🤣 I’ve been missing all the good deals for too long ! I’m trying more budget friendly practices and this is my new go to for flights ! | This is and has been one of the best sites for travel all around the world! The prices and features are great! | I heard great things about this app, I booked 2 separate flights through them and I was charged 40$ from Skiplagged which I’m not understanding why | I always get very good prices when I book with Skip-lagged. | Love it!! It's easy to use and super fast! | So I used this for the first time and however the company made my reservation landed me with 8 reservations which was a red flag. From there I was told the flag was for fraud. I was told that if I do not continue to the final destination I will be black listed from the airline. It just isn’t worth it save yourselves. | This is a great site to book a quick flight for cheap price. I will review it again once my son takes his flight. | Useless | If you can travel light & not check bags, this is a legitimate service that Skiplagged provides that will routinely save you money, especially if you’re willing to #1 travel light, #2 book a couple weeks in advance, #3 not be the type of person that has change your flight multiple times before you actually go. | The unexpected charges upon arrival at the hotel we booked were ridiculous and were not made known to us before arrival. We were told we should’ve booked directly through the hotel instead of a third party (Skiplagged), and we would’ve been made aware of the additional charges. Why allow booking through third parties to begin with if that’s the case? Why would Skiplag not inform customers? | I have found myself using Skiplagged for years now and saving thousands of dollars on flights. I love that you can find the best deals with the best airlines. I highly recommend to anyone who travels on a budget. | I was in Bratislava, Slovakia and skipedlag got me home to jfk on short notice for 600usd. This is definitely the travelers app to consult | So easy to navigate the site for the best days to book flight for the best rates! | Why was i charged $10 after. | Is this app intended for traveling mice?  Why are the origin and Destination on the top of the search SO FREAKING SMALL??? | This site keeps me on top. | Been using it for years and have had no regrets- even wasting travel credits towards a free flight. | I was given a $10 and was not allowed to use it and was no option to add it at checkout. What’s up with the false advertising? | It’s my first time using this App, hope everything will be fine. Many thanks for creators. | I’m excited to have booked a flight for my nieces 9th birthday, with nonstop to and from; i have anxiety and couldn’t fathom a layover flight but my brother in law sent me this link and now I'm ready to pack; thanks Skiplagged. | You have a great prices at the right time | I would like this app to give me the option to filter-out flights on certain airplanes. I do not have confidence in Boeing, so it is important to me to be able to easily filter-out Boeing flights. | Skiplagged has saved me at least $1000 in the span of one year. Absolutely changed my life. It’s a Swiss Army knife for digital nomads. | This App is good for window shopping specifically to see the graphs for pricing. Never make a mistake of purchasing through this App. I booked for SJC to DFW, the ticket after the purchase is for SJC to LGA with a stop over in DFW. When reached out to then they said it’s called hidden city booking and I should have seen that in the terms or whatever. The problem is I can’t check in bags because of wrong destination and can’t cancel the ticket either as there is no refund. | Love frontier thanks for letting me book everytime | Skiplagged is epic for flight and hotel specials. I want take some time to say thank you to the creators of this app and bless you for your works. I saved lots time with this app | This is the best App I have ever used. Thank you! | Best travel site ever! Thank you | As a frequent flyer I am always looking for the best flights. Skiplagged is always the first app I open when booking flights. Such an easy to use app and very great valued ticket prices. I would recommend Skiplagged to anyone flying. | Was charged 9.99 without explanation!!!!! What is this charge for? | WHY BUY PROTECTION ON A FLIGHT IF YOU NEVER REFUND THE MONEY! | The cost of flights have increased since the pandemic.

I will pay for your app. But this paid off doesn’t work for me and lots of people are waking up. | This app often takes me to ads I cannot close!
I have often had to restart my phone to clear the mess. Deleted this garbage. | Too many pop ups and add. Doesn’t know station closures. Waste of time. | Use to be a great app for the past year or more but advertising killed it and it’s pointless now, I was forced to wait for over 30 seconds seeing some game app video before I could see the route I planned. I nearly missed my train several times because of the advertisement preventing me from confirming my route. I’ll not use this app from this point forward. | I am trying to use to get info, instead I am sucked into VIP advertising. When I write review, I have been wasting time choosing one taken nickname after another. Still not over | The new app is complicated repetitive unpractical inefficient and annoying. Very bad decision. | It would be so darn easy for you all to label the platform the same way they do at the station or at the very least have this be info I can click ´more’ to get.  Uptown/Broadway or downtown/Brooklyn is what the station says — your app say Pelham or Utica or 14 Union. | Do not download. The map is incorrect - literally doesn’t do the one thing it’s meant to do. | This is a good app to know the status of subway train service! | Maps doesn’t show Queens-bound daytime M trains and should. | Great to find a place quickly | And here's why: I'm running late for work, frantically trying to see when the next train arrives. I open this app, I tap on my station and... I get an ad. A freaking ad!! I can't think of a worse possible time to force users to sit through an ad than when they desperately need the info on the other side of that ad instantly. developers, find better placement for your ads!! | It shows you an ad while you’re trying to look up if a train that’s coming goes to where you need it to. You don’t have enough time to wait for the ad to finish before the train leaves, so you miss your train. Don’t waste your time. | I get that ads are needed to support the app.,  but the timing of the ads need to be adjusted so that it doesn’t jump out at the most crucial time when one needs to view the map to make a critical decision. The length of the ads needs to be trimmed down as well. | The amount, frequency, and length of ads make the app annoying to use at best and completely unusable at worst. The UI is outdated and looks old. I’m convinced they make the unpaid version unusable so you’re willing to shell out yet another monthly subscription for an app that gives no unique information and offers nothing special. | Don’t take ads that take up the whole screen.  It defeats the purpose of the ap | Full screen video ads popup as I'm trying to quickly look up directions or stop info while riding. They're the kind that are hard to close and cause accidental clicks. Incredibly annoying as I wait for it to play and almost miss my stop. | I know that because it is a free app, you need funding from ads, but if you use this app, you are most likely out of town, and want to find the best subway route fast, or you live in New York, and you are in a hurry, trying to find the best route. Ads every other second is the last thing you need when you are in a hurry. Again, I know that you get your funding from ads, but this is out of control. | Good job | Anytime you want to see the subway map you have to sit through 60 seconds of ads. If you just want to be able to see a subway map for to MTA site and bookmark the free map. | Ayuda mucho al viajar por la ciudad | When you check the subway map, you need it fast as often trains are approaching and you are planning/adjusting your route. This app has ad after ad, which are very long. I deleted for a different one bc I’m tired of being forced to watch 2m of candy crush ads when I just want to know if the M or B/D will get me closer to my destination. Find another map | every time i close an ad another one pops up within seconds. i cannot open the map for more than a few seconds. if i open the app with no service then it just shows a black screen | Every time you use this app you have to see an ad; some are long ads. Annoying | This app was great until they decided to add apps… forget about having ONE ADD you’ll get multiple and you can’t skip them right the way. You have to WAIT for the train to pass to figure out a different route… | If I could give an app negative stars I would. It is almost impossible to look at the map without an ad popping up. And you can’t exit the ad without it sending you to a separate site. Unbelievably frustrating. | The app has very aggressive ads and it will not allow you to navigate away. It locks up and hijacks your phone and the only way to exit will be to close the app. This is ridiculous. | Constant adds. | Ads. Too  many pop ups | I used this app during my last trip to the city and found it wonderful for navigating the subway. This new version is now utterly useless as you can’t use the app without being forced to watch ad after ad after ad. I am deleting this app. | It was easy to navigate. I couldn’t get to the Service updates.  Only wanted to confirm that the F stops at Lex & 53 Street.  Five seconds after opening the APP a pop up took over insisting that I download a ‘life changing’ game.  I could not close the pop up.  

Best solution:  I deleted this App that I had for fifteen years and downloaded the official MTA app.   What a shame.  Don’t force people to look at your Ads.  I do pay for other apps. | Muy util para moverse por la ciudad | Whenever you open the app, you get about 2 seconds before the ads start playing.  Then even if you finish watching the ad, if you switch to a different app and switch back, you’ll get another ad.  Literally unusable.

Was not like this when I first started using it a few years ago. | This app will constantly flood you with advertisements. Although the app is very precise, they use ads as a sort of extortion to entice you to upgrade. Usually you only have moments to see train times before a new ad will come and block the app. Terrible overall. | Full of ads that get in the way of using the map | Adequate notifications, maps updated every delay or year. Once used it 2 years ago. Useful if you don’t want to go all the way to the end of the platform and rushing to the front if train is approaching the station. Wish it has bus notifications too, including the Metro North and Long Island Rail Road. | Too many adds.  Hard to get rid of them   No clear x | Who Invented A Train App That Has ADS FOR WHAT !!!!!???? 😒😒😒😒😒 | Too many pop-ups to be a useful app… | Have been using this app for years and the ads just get crazier. I exit the app for a few mins and the ads come back again. So frustrating! | Once it’s on you can’t really close it. And always when you need to look into it. Just deleted it. I recommend everyone the same… | I miss my train all the time because of SOOOOOO many ads. What’s the point | The adds and games are very annoying , need expeditious acccess to app when traveling thru subway system  . | All the pop up ads are so annoying and make this piece of garbage app unusable | I’ve been trying to get to the train schedule and I can’t because constant ad videos show up!!! | It looked like a virus came through my last subway app. A red flag popped up and warned that my phone memory is running low and I have to click on their arrow to fix it.
I deleted the app and am now trying to download it again. | This app should be removed as it is now just and endless stream of spam/ads popping up. I can’t even get the info I need in time to catch the train. Just download a free pdf of the map and uninstall this bloatware. | Could be a decent app, but the only intrusive advertisements, the free version vexing to use. | App started out ok but if you’re actually trying to navigate the subway you’ll have to wait for minutes if Ads. Yes, minutes. Ridiculous. Just get the MYmta app instead. No ads, same maps. | I don’t mind ads. I know this app is free but it’s too much. The ads pop every single use, or just see different route.

I’m impressed with the service! | No help with customer service. App does not working properly. | Please hire someone to check how the app works for checking in. You can’t normally enter an expiration date of the documents - need to scroll the 10,000 box. Ridiculous. Also im constantly getting app errors when trying to check in. Terrible app, please hire someone competent to inspect the functionality. | App is good at uploading info from passport but not good at letting you update anything else. My husband accidentally purchased carry ons rather than check ins and I was trying to update and the app would not allow. 

Asks for your name at end of the review and no matter what you type in, it gives you a message saying that name is taken. | Not only is it a great price for airline tickets but a lot of flights to pick. Am definitely going to be flying Volaris in the future and definitely will be recommending to friends and family . 
Am very happy and excited for my upcoming journey. Thanks again | 👍 | Excelente servicio | The app doesn’t respond when you hit NEXT or CONTINUE. It doesn’t tell you that you’re missing information in fields that don’t indicate that they’re required, Thus, it doesn’t move to the next page. | Esta promoción me vino como anillo al dedo. Estaba en busca de ofertas y salió esto. Estoy súper contenta | Good airline | “If you want to log in to see basic information about your flight. You can go f yourself”
 
                                                                -Volaris | The v club is a scam. It’s poor design doesn’t allow for the purchasing of tickets for another person. The system will swap out the name of the passenger that you’ve selected for your name.  This is very frustrating because ñame chances or cancellations are not allowed to correct this system issue. Very frustrating. | I have been trying to modify a flight it takes me out of the app. I called customer service and they don’t answer. Doesn’t even give me an option to speak to someone. I try to send messages through WhatsApp, and I get automated responses from a virtual person, not useful at all. Frustrating to the max!
Not sure why they are allowed to do business in the US. | Everybody was wonderful! | App and web won’t let you check in or buy luggage, front desk charge fees after fees for checking in with them and very expensive!!! fee for luggage. Every one had the same problems, never again traveling with Volaris. That’s illegal what they do. | I can’t believe you charge for a boarding pass!  Wow! | Cheap service | At the moment of checking in. It did not display the space for email addresses nor did not show any signs to add it.  After several attempts I went and included the email address and after 25 minutes it was completed. Volaris you used to be forward thinking now you are navigating mediocrity all the way. | Los mejores precios | Even when you sign in for the  V club the annual fee it’s different when you make your reservation and whatever discount they advertise the prices still high and they don’t get applied | Great customer service | The app did not give up to date flight information on our return flight from Mexico. It never listed a gate or that our flight was delay. The app said on time and the gate area was blank. I had to look up my flight online using the website in order to get more accurate information. The gate was never listed online but the flight delay was listed there. 
Also the app kept showing me an old flight instead of my current flight whenever I opened it. I would have to do a search with my last name and booking number in order to pull up my return flight. | I CAN NEVER purchase through APP. Always a road block that cannot be fixed. MUST call customer service. End up purchasing over the phone. 
This time, tried making an in person reservation AT THE AIRPORT, VOLARIS DOES NOT do that. I asked if there was anyplace in the airport where it’s possible. They said NO. Arrangements over the phone, done. However, instead of spending $190, my ONE WAY trip is $421. I’m already on a tight budget. Now I’ll have to borrow from family to return. Checking in, ability to take picture of passport doesn’t work. Other than that, it is  possible to check in manually. That’s fine. Please update APP so that it works. | From the moment we checked in, staff had attitude and unhelpful. Then to add to the injury, so many extra surprised charges. Don’t think I will ever fly Volaris again and would not recommend it to anyone. I live down the street from the airport & I’d rather drive to Tijuana and take a plane from there. | This app and even the website is not user friendly at all! | The app is awful. The customer service phone experience is awful, you can't book a flight over the phone!!! Seriously? The THREE agents I spoke with barely spoke English. I was told to go to the airport for assistance, what a joke, they said they couldn't help me. 
I am SO DISGUSTED, I can't select zero for my stars! | I just read a review from a customer explaining the same exact issue that I am experiencing FROM 5 YEARS AGO. I find it absolutely unacceptable for a company to allow for such big issue from this app to continue for this long. This airline cannot even attempt to invest in their app and improve their customer service because they obviously do not care. My issue is that I attempted to check in twice through the app but the “confirm information” and “next” button would not allow me to proceed onto the next step. This is not the first time this has happened to me. Other family members of mine have also experienced this issue and other annoying software issues (i.e. lagging and crashing). Please improve the app. | Fast simple | Website and app work horrible. It would freeze, boot me out, or restart process of booking multiple times. | Es una Muy buena Aerolínea Volaris 😘 | EXCELENTE!!!!!! | I recently found Volaris and was hesitant at first after reading many negative reviews. 

Being a solo traveler who travels light Volaris is AMAZING! everyone I needed to make any changes their customer service always exceeded my expectations. 
This is a budget airline and room wise it can be a bit cramped.  I also have never checked a bag or brought a carry on as well as my flights have all been direct. With those things being said in my experience Volaris earns 5+ stars from me! 
Thank you!!!! | Was a smooth transition threw the app | No permite | I had just closed the app for 5 min went back in to purchase my tickets, and price went up almost $100 dollars. | Muy mal servicio y te cobran asta por el aire que respiras adentro de el avión | by using volaris virtual check in you can save time and money. Justed with some clicks here and there you can check in and save your qr codes. Great optios | Son un asco tus tarifas si ya avia   echo el pago de de un vuelo y solo por el cambio me cobraron mucho mas 700 dls por un vuelo sencillo cuando avia comprado el redondo y solo fueron 400 por eso son un asco sus tarifas y es un robo asia sus clientes | Unable to upgrade seats | It took me several time to be able to retrieve my information.  It is not friendly at all. | Servicio en declive. Esta aerolínea simplemente no mejora, es un caos al momento no solo de reservar, sino también al momento de abordar. Claro, estoy de acuerdo en que también ciertos pasajeros tienden a empeorar la situación pues simplemente no siguen INDICACIONES y la aerolínea no se esfuerza en hacerlos respetar. 
Así cómo? | Terrible website is not user friendly. | Easy to use, however the application does seem to freeze sometimes | Every time I’m trying to book a flight and I find a cheaper fare, half way through the process it kicks me off the app and when I log back in, the lower fare is not an option anymore so I have to purchase the flights at a higher rate.  I feel the airline app does this intentionally in order not to honor the lower rate. | Awful app… has way to many glitches. | If I have a return ticket with the same airline Volaris the app can’t let me do a check in online that is wrong! Other airlines allow you to do that and avoid having to do the same line again and again | Tengo 8 años volando con volaris y yo no e tenido un contratiempo con ellos gracias volarais | to us | & avoid flying with Volaris!",4.74875,312634,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1c/e2/ec/1ce2ecaa-7296-08e9-ed9c-f67ebac05f8a/e112e7dd-677f-41b7-b3fe-c7fb81ab324b_01_image.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/77/2a/a9/772aa9cd-4217-4d7a-76dc-82612177826f/0cb6e994-14bd-43b2-88aa-3e8fe6b0aa9b_02_image_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/eb/09/f4/eb09f465-1de2-4405-9d24-9db44c6cbdf9/953a5d63-ae11-4359-beaf-a1e07721027d_03_image_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/10/3c/68/103c6811-bc86-c232-bb74-1dee9d71b82a/df7c86f2-d939-4150-943f-4a8d7d33bc3a_04_image.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/b9/32/dc/b932dc75-f5c2-3046-344d-fe003e23fe12/c3d640fb-c8fc-42e7-a35a-b32b7b9a0a75_05_image.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d2/8c/1f/d28c1fb4-4cd6-13cd-f6d7-ed8f9d234228/4c12d701-55f3-40a5-807e-5e35fe656596_06_imageEN.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I deleted and tried reinstalling but same thing. | What happened to HA? I used to fly them frequently to Hawaii from the mainland and was always a pleasant experience. Most recently took and int’l flight to Japan and I will not fly HA again if I can help it. The app of course was not working when I’m at the airport when it was time to access the boarding pass, good thing I had a paper boarding pass. The chat agents gave me the wrong info both times when I had questions about check in and terminal info. The flight attendants were busy talking to each other versus helping passengers. The baggage staff at the airport were rude and mean…. Just terrible experience all around. Super disappointing. | Password and username keeps logging out and have to continually enter the confirmation number to check in or check statuses. Get better like Delta. | A family member booked a ticket with Hawaiian Airlines and changed the seat without notifying them.  We called customer service and they are unable to resolve | You send an email to Che kin- and the. You have to have your confirmation number. All the others have a link that auto check in you in with one click. Get with it. | I booked a flight fine but when I try to upgrade my seats, I am unable to.  Support has not answered any emails & texts do not go through.  I get an error when I click to edit the seats which says I made the reservation on another country’s site & need to pick the appropriate country’s flag to make edits there.  It has 5 flags to choose from & none of them work when chosen.  Same error.  I made the reservation on the US site.  This is a glitch with Hawaiian Airlines.  It needs fixed.  I usually fly American Airlines & have never had an issue like this with their app.  It’s frustrating & upsetting.  Especially since no one will address my issue.  Not cool. | The flight search won’t work and hasn’t worked for a few weeks | Always needs updating and even then doesn’t work properly. Always crashing when you need to do important things like check-in, search for flights, etc. Keeps telling me it doesn’t recognize my username/account, but I can log in fine on .com. This app needs major work; currently useless and adds to bad customer experience. | Hawaiian airlines resistant to help at counter after TSA agents ran to gate to alert assist needed. Lihue airport HAL staff have no experience with trouble shooting and assisting customers. My group of 4 and another group of 2 were refused assistance. Last flight and customer service out like the wind. 

My family of 4 had no car, no place to go. We got kicked out of the airport and slept on a bench and ground due to rain because the whole place closed. 

I flew in from HNL to say goodbye to a dear family member and turmoil exacerbated.  I even went to United, Alaska to see if I could fly out but no luck. 

Unfortunate that my extenuating circumstance met with delays on HAL and stress of my family member dying, increased stress and no in person to assist has left me and my family in the cold. | One, I’ve saved my facial recognition several times yet the app is not storing this from login to login. Two, no adjustment for holding iPad horizontally rather than vertically. Three, though I’ve saved an upcoming trip to “My Trips” several times, the app forgets it login to login (and agin, each login has to be username password as it’s not remembering my facial recognition - frustrating). Four, when getting seats for a reservation with multiple guests, you had better remember the order of the guests as the app has it, as switching seats is not easy - have to cancel and go back in - and the better seats are crazy expensive in the $56-$92 range for each flight plus you have to pay flight by flight rather than collectively at the end. Just not a very user friendly app. Not recommended. Maybe book through your computer? | Poor App design.  Very difficult to find CC number for flight check-in.  Chat representative was polite but uninformed. And it took over an hour just to check-in, what takes only minutes on other carriers. | Hawaiian Airlines has exceptional service and great flights. However, this app has been the most disappointing of my experiences with HAL.

Facial recognition does not work with this app for some reason and will direct you to sign in manually. The login info should be correct but it will, again, deny you from logging in through the app. If I cannot sign in to the app even after resetting my password, this already defeats the purpose of having it.

You cannot change seats or do much on the app as it will require you to head over to the website. The only thing the app is good for, when successfully able to log in, so far has been to have a QR code e-pass ready for boarding. Unfortunately, I have only been able to use this twice.

Please fix the issues and update the software. There is so much more potential to this app and would make things more convenient. | At every step, I ran into an error, hit try again 3-4 times and then the step worked. Crazy!! | Worst app ever.  Hire Delta to show how it’s done. | A lot of functions like changing seats, updating your reservation, or updating passenger info cannot be done on the app. It takes you to a website and makes the app feel clunky. Furthermore, I had to change my flight to a day later, and every time I opened the app, the previous flights would show up until I refreshed my trips. Everything seems to take ages to load. | I can’t pick my seats nor can I pay for my bags on the app. It’s now happened twice. Pretty terrible interface! | This app is awful for the average busy traveling person. It is not user friendly nor practical to book with especially using miles or even in general, nor to make flight changes. If you an idea of what I’m talking about, please see Southwest’s app. It’s is much more efficient to use. | This app does NOT allow you to book with miles. | Horrible slow and does not link on a consistent basis with website. | I can’t believe our family with 2 little kids, ages 5 and 7 cannot sit together.  Other airlines would not split a family.  Highly disappointing experience. | The facial recognition consistently doesn’t work which is a hassle for me.  Otherwise it’s an OK app, not the best, not the worst but it does what I need it to so I recommend it but beware of facial recognition working when you first download it and then never again. | App concatenates your first and middle names which means your ticketed name doesn’t match your ID. Extremely trusting having to re-enter my miles number, redress, and/or known traveler number at check in. I already enter that information when I book and with my profile on the app- it should just carry over. | The app never loads my trips when I login. I continually have to look up my confirmation number in my email and input it in the app, every stinking time I login! Also, it rarely remembers my TSA known traveler number. I have all of my family members’ numbers in my profile and without fail every flight someone’s number is not loaded. There is just so much double checking and additional imputing into the app. Isn’t that why I have the app? I never have these types of problems with other airline apps. | Continually need to add the trip after a couple of days. The trip shows on my account on the website but not in the app.

A lot of links are not native to the app and take you to a website. | Please check app.  Pricing for first class seats are adding the departure and return.  It’s doubling.  Main cabin pricing is ok-  it doesn’t double. | Great service.  Exceptional care given by flight crew. | It is annoying that I must reload my trip every time I use the app.  What’s the point? | This will be our third time visiting Kauai, the Hawaiian airlines staff have always been so helpful and attentive! Love using their airline. Family of 5! | Always logging my account out, my trips never populating. It’s so annoying, I always keep it updated. Always have to delete app then log in and log out and also input my confirmation code for my flight. Needs improvement. And also why still no mile search option. It’s 2024 why still no reliable or basic features, or have they given up considering they got bought up. | Now you can’t even try and book a flight on the app.  The recent update didn’t do any good. | WHY is it that when I use the app it always has wrong password & have to call in & clear it & try again!
The person who answers ur line must be SICK of always getting a call from ME | This flight is very convenient for me because I live close to Oakland Airport and I visit friends and family who live close to Hilo Airport. | Hawaiian Airlines app is easy to book easy to make changes | It is a mess to navigate, and it does not recognize signed in members. Just awful. | Not sure why, but Hawaiian Airlines App is the most difficult airlines app out there,,What are your developers doing?! Super inconvenient that it doesn’t allow us to make changes to our flights,,almost all the other major airline carriers have flight changing capabilities on their app,,that’s the purpose of having an APP,,it’s convenient,,But Hawaiian Airlines App is far from convenient,,Hopefully you guys get it together, cuz i don’t plan on not flying on Hawaiian, i just hate having to do all of my flight managing online because the app doesn’t allow it,,, | Not happy how the prices have increased for Kama’aina inter-island flights! Over $80 one way for a flight is disgraceful. | All 5 of my families iPhone's were not able to access in flight entertainment. All running latest apple updates and app updates. Two of our flight attendants tried to solve issue but we're not able to. Any suggestions? | Love the quick and easy check in and save to wallet | Can’t even get on app. BIG FAIL!

The app shut off and I had to start over so many times I lost count. I still can’t see the trip I booked for the price quoted. | I spent over an hour carefully crafting a trip for my family of four, a package. As I was entering my card information the trip vanished. Customer service said the pricing must have “updated” while I was completing my booking and so the entire trip is gone. Vanished. They said I would have to create an entirely new package at whatever prices are in the system now. Complete waste of time and now I have to begin completely again as the price has gone up by over 25%! No offer was made to remedy the situation in spite of a lengthy conversation via their messenger function with a representative. I was congenial, I didn’t get upset with the agent. He doesn’t make the rules or have any desire to rip me off. | Now stop asking for a review. | So I was traveling to Texas for my daughter Basic Training graduation but on the way we needed to stop and rest. I reserved a room at a hotel I thought would be safe a week before we were to leave. It was $164. I seen they had a 8 star review so I thought it was good. Then the day comes we get to Little Rock. We pull in the parking lot there is a active drug deal going on and homeless people in the parking lot with grocery carts full of there stuff passed out in front of hotel at closed down gas station. I didn’t even feel safe leaving my car. I went on the Travelocity app to cancel my reservation but you cannot cancel through the app. A week later I tried to get the matter resolved after I got back home. I had to wait 72 hours only for them to tell me I have to follow this crappy hotel’s cancellation policy. What do you mean? there was no way to cancel. So I went online looking for a new hotel while I was there and found out that the hotel was only $60 a room through Google. So Travelocity charged 100. I will never use this app again. this company are thieves and is not about customer service. trust me you’ll see them going out of business soon. | Been trying to get a confirmation email to sign up
For quite some time today | Was charged $46 additional per night when checking into the hotel.  When we contacted their help desk, said the hotel sent me an email after I booked that they were going to do that?!?! | Ffjiyfhuyfgyhrtb gyuyyjX | Travelocity is my go to for airlines and hotels.

Easy to navigate the website for stays and flight choices. Definitely my go to for booking our vacations. | Check in was a breeze. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Room was nice and clean and beds were extremely comfortable. Would definitely recommend. | Me encanta esta aplicación para buscar mejores tarifas de vuelos baratos | Not sure why the app using Spanish that I do not understand even my profile indicate English and there is no place to change the language or if it is there obviously not clear.

I booked a hotel and made a mistake by selecting the ""pay at the hotel"" option. I contacted your company and spoke to a representative who advised me to go back and book again, this time making the payment upfront. I followed their advice and paid for my hotel upon arrival. The embassy was kind enough to cancel my initial booking, which I had tried multiple times on the app without success. However, when I was checking in, I was charged an additional $175 on my card from you as a result. This situation has put me in a difficult financial situation as a single mom with limited funds. I wanted to bring this issue to your attention and express my dissatisfaction with the experience. | This application is nothing more than consumer fraud
They do NOT list all the information from rental car companies 
Terms are vague and not all listings are accurate 

Then they bait you with a non refundable offer and when you get to the counter your cost will more than double if you even get a car | Games pricing to screw you, makes customer service harder | I had a emergency and had to leave the next day and I wasn’t reimbursed. Travelocity said call motel and the motel didn’t refund me or give me my deposit back | App does a good job of letting me manage my flights. I wish they had a flight “info card” that I could share with friends and family that details of the flight, but not the price paid. | Confusing, everything comes up in Spanish (which isn’t a problem), but the rest is in English, app won’t b let me book with breakfast -It’s strange. | Travelocity is my go to for all things Travel. I can always count on great prices and my search to be quick and easy.  Top Notch! | It said download app and get 15% off first booking.  I did then it said coupon expired!!!!! | Why are the prices higher for the exact same room using your app than booking on your website? This makes no sense. | Booked a room through the app thinking it had the best deal, and then looked to see what it would’ve cost to book directly with the hotel. The app ended up costing me $51 more for a non refundable room. Won’t be using it again. | I thought the lodge was great | Not real happy with Travelocity as you are not able to select seats. They place you where ever they want, even not next to family members | This is the worst app. I have my settings set for English. And when I search for a flight, it switches to Spanish. It is so aggravating! | Why ask for a review 10 seconds into a search on your site? | The check-in process was easy. The staff was kind and attentive. The location is great and the property is well-kept. | We Are The Best | Not sure why I am seeing Spanish when I checked English. | Travelocity has always been confident and secure with all of my travel needs! I always use Travelocity for all my travel needs!!
Thank you!! | Great | Why is it so hard to talk to someone? | When I scanned the QR code, it didn’t take me to my flight information. It doesn’t save me. | Went to book a room and afterwards was told it was a smoking room. No refund even though I purchased their worthless insurance. Stuck | I hate your app | You try to make your password when you try to get in it tells you you cannot get in until after 15 minutes that’s really awful. | Love the app for the most part with regard to ease of use, finding flights, etc. ~ big frustration is finding the perfect flights and price, then they increase significantly at check out. My only complaint, but its a huge problem. Would love to be able to trust the process. Thanks ~ | I booked a room for a over seas trip and needed to add another person to the reservation. After several attempts through the app I was unable to update my booking. A full 56 days before the trip I contacted an agent online only to be told that the couldn’t get ahold of the hotel, that the only way to upgrade my reservation was to cancel it and rebook or find another place. So I cancelled, the reservation clearly stated that I could cancel the reservation up to a week before with no problem. I then received an email saying that I would have to pay a cancellation fee because the reservation was cancelled to late for a full refund. I purchased trip insurance and then found out that it wasn’t refunded and was cancelled so no refund at all! I will not use this app again. | My flight and hotel was booked through Travelocity and my flight was cancelled and I tried calling to get refunded my money from the hotel. I spoke to 2 different people and they both hung up on my face with no help at all my fiancée had just lost his son and they didn’t even take that into consideration at all. The customer service from both the representatives from Travelocity were very unprofessional and rude by continuously hanging up in my face. I will never book with this hotel nor Travelocity again!!!!😡 Spirit gave me my money back but the hotel would not refund my money….!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!! | I made through Travelocity.. landed.. waited for Thrifty transport van to pick me up. Showed the van  driver my reservation on  my phone. 
He says.. we  don’t have  your reservation AND.. we have 0 cars.
.. so.. here I’m standing in a foreign country without a car. The nice man monitoring the parking at the airport hooked me up with a local company.  
Just think .. if they had no cars!! I had 80 minute drive to my destination. I’ll Never hook again on your website. I travel  frequently.. so this was the first experience of no reservation when I could prove I had  one.
Get your act together… I hear this is not uncommon of your website. 
Might want to fix it b4 you lose more users.. | I made this reservation in January when I first knew of the wedding this weekend.  From the pictures, your place seemed perfect for my husband and me!!! However, when my husband came check in, he found that we were to be on  the  3rd floor!

If there was an option, I’d be willing to purchase a lifetime subscription to support this app I’ve loved and advertised to my friends. But a recurring subscription for once-free features feels slimy. | Very unfortunate that I cannot set it up in Mexican pesos. | Everyone in your group needs to have an account, otherwise you can’t use the app at all. I was under the impression you could put everyone’s expenses in and have the app split it fairly, but it requires everyone involved to download the app and give their name or phone number to create an account. Definitely do not recommend. | Splitwise added a daily limit of only 4 transaction entries per day, 2 of which require you to wait 10 seconds staring at ads for their premium subscription before you can enter the transaction. This change was not communicated to users beforehand and is a clear example of hostile design to force users into subscriptions. I’ve used this app for 8 years but will switch to another service. Please stay away and use something else. | Can only add 4 expenses a day.. then you have to get pro.. I like to sit down at the end of the trip and add everything, so not convenient for free users. Also not worth paying that much for pro. | Been using this free app for years. Tried to split a bill today and see you’re forcing users into the Pro version with the timer and limited # of expenses. Immediately deleted and never going back. | Can’t link to Venmo | Try the app Tricount. Splitwise was great for tracking purchases between my spouse and friends through our daily lives but now with the limited 3 inputs per day, it’s a pain unless you pay. This has changed my view of the app. Tricount seems to be the alternative option. | Thanks for making the app worse to use to try to make more money. | This app is the best | I received an invite to a group
Accepted and signed up with Google login
Then it made me download the app
When I try to log in via the app, it wants a password, but I don’t have one because I created an account with Google! And there is no Google login button in the app.
So then I try to reset password, have to click through never-ending picture puzzles that don’t even fit on the screen. Clearly people don’t test their own user experience | This app is a game changer for Group Vacations! | Only 3 expenses allowed per day on the free tier. Basically useless. Predatory, and should stop locking even the most basic functions behind a paywall. | It’s so simple but like all good ideas it is simple and fills a need.  No more check splitting chaos on our yearly guys trip. We just put it in Splitwise and settle up later.  It’s great. | A friend suggested we use this app to track expenses during a holiday weekend. I paid for a VERY expensive dinner,  others paid small amounts. When it came time to settle up, one person “sent” me payment via the app, but since I am unwilling to give my personal info to this shady company, I never received any money. I can now not see  what that person still owes me. It’s in the $$$ range. 

Don’t use this app if you care about your personal info. | This is the best site ever. I travel a lot with my friends and it makes it so much easier for us to track who spent one and who owes what money love the app. | You don’t take back core features as part of a monetization model.

Adding expenses is the whole point of the app, and was free for ages. Use ads, that’s fine. Force me to watch a video, fine.

Don’t make it free then force me to pay once you amassed your user base. | Kind of ridiculous that you’d limit the amount of items your users can add to Splitwise unless they pay for Pro. Paying for the most basic feature of an app? Splitwise use to be good but now they’re trying to monetize their most basic features since they can’t come up with good add ons or incentive users to subscribe lol. | Used this app for years for many group trips and now with a monthly fee and ads and then a limit of number of entries per day!? I’d happily pay a reasonable fee for the app but a monthly fee and then you have to convince everyone else in your group to do the same? Hard pass. | So user friendly and helpful! | Great app, where have you been all my life?  Great interface, intuitive, and it covers all the bases. | This app was great for a long time. I wouldn’t mind if they took a cut when you settled up - 1 or 2% per Venmo redirect. But this pro mode thing is not it. Looking for a new coat sharing app. | Its worth every penny! | It used to be great but now is filled with upsell for the pro version. Very sad | Cómo crítica constructiva les pediría que sacaran planes para pareja con precio especial y que en las gráficas se tuviera acceso a la suma total de gastos del mes. De resto está app es la app favorita de mi vida! | Very difficult to use. I have used it many times before, but now it keeps driving my to the PRO version and I can not get the payments to work. To bad for the changes, we had used it many times before. | I love the actual app for splitting expenses. However, someone transferred me money via the app, and it was very difficult to add a bank account so if you’re going to use this app, just use Venmo to settle up. | Now you have to watch an ad before adding a single expense and even then you can't add more than 4 expenses per day. | Used to use the app but now you can only add 3 expenses a day and you have to watch ads? What an out of touch update lol ruined | Like others, I used to encourage everyone to use Splitwise because it was a great, convenient app. However, the recent ads and expense limits are going to make me drop it… I can do the same things in a spreadsheet. And I’d be in the group of those likely pay a one-time fee, but a subscription - for a product easily replaced by other tools? Forget it. | This app is occasion based (ie only used when I go on group trips). A monthly/ yearly fee doesn’t make sense | Outrageously complicated process of connecting funding sources. Such a great idea and such a poorly executed experience. | This used to be a great app, but as others have pointed out, the “free” version is effectively useless now, with only allowing 4 transactions per day, and the cost of pro is too steep to justify using this over just a Google spreadsheet. I told nearly all of my friends to use Splitwise a few years ago, but now those friends come to me asking if I still use it and I have to tell them, “don’t bother.” So long, and thanks for all the fish. | Just back from trip to Europe.  Have used several times before to settle with friends and fam on trips.  Worked great, now they want you to upgrade to a monthly fee- showing adds after entering a couple receipts and you wait ten seconds before entering the next receipt.  Then it limits you to 4 receipts per day… | I settled up through Splitwise and see a transfer made from my account but Splitwise says I’m not settled up and the receiving party did not receive payment?
What happened to my transfer?
Is there anything you can do to assist? | I understand the need to run your business but constant ads every second and a limit to your addition is ridiculous. And 5$ as a base price per month for this ? Not worth it. Splitwise is primarily used by students who actually cannot afford basic living  , I am pretty sure majority will abandon the app. Giving an insight into your expenses might be more appropriate as a ""premium"" feature, not basic listing expenses. | They hold funds a very long time. I am still waiting to be able to make a withdrawal of funds they got access to almost three days ago. Venmo, Apple Pay and Zelle are more reliable. | It’s a good app but now you can only add a few expenses before you hit your limit with the free version. I considered upgrading to premium until I saw that it is a monthly subscription. I’ve had enough of everything being a subscription. I’d rather watch ads then have to pay another monthly subscription. What a waste. | Wont upload upgrade therefore limiting amount of expenses i can add and holding up info i need to give out to hostess. | This app is becoming a pain to use. The ads are invasive and the daily limits on the number of expense entities is absurd. I have been a long time user of Splitwise, and told many friends about it, but I am going to look into Splid and Tricount as alternatives. If I could watch ads to not have a limit on the number of expense entries, that would be one thing, but I'm not watching ads for a downgraded experience. No thanks. I understand the developers want to make money, but I'm not paying $40/year for a glorified Excel sheet. | It would be great if the app had the option for a lifetime purchase. | Why do we have to send an invite to someone to be able to track an expense?

I want to use this and be able to track everything, but I do not need the other person to know. It is more for my sanity.

Yes, the feature for us both to be able to is good. But I should be able to track something without it as well.

So until this can be done, this app is useless to me and will be deleting. | Had been a avid user off the app but I hate they bought in the limited number of splits per day option. I understand the push to get users to use pro but there could be better ways to do it. This restriction gives a very bad customer experience.
You could keep the 10 sec waiting piece but please let the user add more number of splits per day.
You can delay sending it to the people one is splitting with but at least let them add it.
Please bring it back to as it was before. | This was one of my favorite apps being simple and efficient to use.  For users needing more features, they made a paid pro version that provides that.  Now, to promote the sale of the pro version, they actively made the app worse for free users.  There are now intentional delays if you want  register several expenses in a day (they force you to wait 15 seconds while you can't do anything), and a hard cap on expenses per day of you are even willing to put up with the waiting time.

This is an example of a team that uses resources and time to make the experience of users *worse* to drive sales, rather than making their pro version worth buying.  If one pays for the pro version, what's to stop them from coming up with a higher priced subscription and just make everything else garbage?  The design direction of this app, deliberately inconveniencing users to drive sales, is disrespectful. | The free tier of this app has very little use now. Ever since they added a 10 second timer to the ""+"" button and limited expenses to 3 a day, I no longer see the use for this app. | Difficult to undo charges not meant for the group but to a person in the group . | Why is it so difficult to create a new group. | So confused. Payments get messed up. Legit pointless. Just Venmo the people directly. App is not user friendly.

They do not activate and you have to beg them to get you a refund. They don’t have 24/7 support so you’re stuck trying to digure it out yourself until one of their support team wakes up from their beauty sleep. | if you know you know. | It’s useful.

This app is awesome!! | Amazing I love it | This is awesome to find free or open wifi in some areas, but more people need to join and share wifi details to make it awesome!

Has got me out of a spot here and there!! | I downloaded this and I never did use it cause I couldn’t figure it out so I just uninstalled it and then they charge me $50 and will not give me a refund. I am not a happy person at all so I would not recommend this. | This is works really good and this helps a lot in case of an emergency | The eSIM for Brazil simply doesn’t work. Even if it did work I’d be stuck with 3G. I tried to speak to the support and get my money back but they never got back to me. | تغيير شكل لوقو | Good | I have tried others and this is the best so far | the free version is all that I need | What’s a concept | Let’s see how it pans out — but app works well and the crypto rewards timed with the likely 2024 bull run, make this app a must

For example, I was thinking about a Lilo and stitch themed planner, but then when I went to the AI and I typed stitch, drinking Boba, it just showed a blue Pokémon Pikachu Charmander looking thing so I thought it didn't understand so I just changed it. When I changed it, I put Lilo and stitch drinking Boba. it didn't change. It just showed Pikachu Charmander and blue Charmander Pikachu, drinking Boba. This is stupid. | The reason why it’s only OK is because you can barely get anything without the premium  and I’m not paying that much money for premium and you can only get like three AI pictures a day | I was finding a App and I downloaded this one but it’s so annoying it keeps doing the money trail on every app I download I get so annoyed I just started this game it’s kind of fun. At least you got me in. but I don’t know what to do it’s telling me to write stuff I don’t like it it’s too annoying when I see it The journal thingies I don’t like it it’s asking me the money trail all the time and I just can’t find an app that I wanted this isn’t fair why can’t games just delete their money trail nobody cares about the trail it’s so annoying | I love this app because it has many features and it’s useful to me there might be adds but it’s only a few and you might have to pay for the fanciest version but I like the normal version! | this app is kinda bad, there’s not much to do really there’s templates and stuff but i think there should be more to it | This app is super easy to plan and write events and other things!🤗❤️😃😁 | I hate this app because you have to pay to even do stuff and I want one of the templates but it’s not free like UGH | YOU CAN NOT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT HAVING THAT DUMB PREMIUM | I definitely don’t like this app. At first I was like “oh my gosh you can make ai stickers?!” I was so excited to do it until I clicked on it and it showed a money trial that wouldn’t disappear. Until it got really annoying, and then I deleted the app. I didn’t want that app bothering me. I will keep looking for a journal app that is free. | I don't like it | ʂʅαყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყყ | I saw someone using it on Pinterest. So I said, hey, I need a monthly planner to get my life organized. I downloaded the app, and the first thing I saw was “Join this subscription” or whatever, but you get my point. I clicked go with standard version and what I see, TWO free journals just TWO. I click one, then I go to templates BARELY any free templates there. I’ve been trying multiple planning apps and they AT LEAST have more than 2 free options. I’m not a person to spend money on apps. Do better please. | I was just in the App Store trying to find a nice cute planner. I came across this one I bought it. Right when it downloaded i immediately opened to see that it said no connection. So I checked my internet and is was on a full bar.I checked my router,and it still said that there was no connection. So now I really want to know how to use this planner. But I will probley get a different planner now. | This app is so good but like in the middle of my journal while I am writing it pops up a screen and I have to wait until a X appears so yeah. Overall so gooooooood god bless u guys have a nice day | DON'T BUY THIS! COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT! | I gave it an optimistic shot, but was totally let down! It’s honestly not worth the time or effort, unfortunately. :/ | Really bad you have to pay for like everything | It was so bad you had to pay for everything don’t get this app. It seemed like a nice aesthetic useful app you just had to pay for everything was annoying. Don’t get it. | Worst step ever | Hi like I said in the title it was no good. The reason why is because I don’t have a lot of money I just got a job I and I need a FREE note book on my phone or iPad to help me I keep track of things. Like how much sleep I get or how much water I get maybe even when I go to work or come back. But when I go in the app it said buy a subscription. | The reason why this is the best because even tho it ask u to pay just click on it and decline it and then there is a x up there click on that u get in. It could get annoying but it’s worth it! Also it is very fun and calming!
I luv this and I’m sure u too! | It lied on one of the comments it send that there was a free version BUT there is no free version it costs’s MONEY | It’s not free!! Don’t wast your time on this | This planner has helped me so much. i’m a lot more protective my health is better. | jstrersyrttrj$trjdtjrdrthhjMhgchtmctu,vtuftyktykftyftudjytfjytfjytfyjtfkytfjytfythddtjrdetjste2yredjytgukfturshreryseerturgdgjgdxhhshtrd46)$ dyrudrthdtrhdrjhtrhtedhetdthesehtdethdehtrffff | Everytime I wrote with my Apple Pencil it would lag badly causing my writing to be off as well as it lagged when backspacing using the given back arrow | I don’t mind that you have to pay money in the app but I would like a writing supply that would be the color I chose on the format. Otherwise it’s a fun way to put down ideas but most of it cost money and if it pops up it removes all the work you had which is frustrating when you have a limited time or a tight work schedule. | There’s subscriptions for absolutely everything now a days and the it’s getting tiring.. subscription fatigue is a real thing. We don’t need a subscription for a simple planner!!!! I just ended up deleting your app, instead of gaining another customer you lost one. I wouldn’t mind the ads or the option to buy the service as a one time payment. But like they say vote with your wallet! | Everything is good, but i don’t like how most of the things are premium or you have to pay for. | 많이 엄청나게 쓰지는 않는데 1개월마다 돈 내야해서 돈이 살짝 아까움. 이뻐보여서 앱 받았는데 돈때문에 쓸 수 없는게 너무 많음. | Makes you pay for everything , every time you finish typing something it disappears. This app is trash | You have to pay for basically everything.All I wanted was a planer that you don’t have to pay for | This app look so good in the pictures but once added you pretty much have to pay for everything I do not recommend. | Thank you and happy Valentine’s Day | digital planner brought me home where the heart is rpr | The app is very
Good but you do have to pay for all the cute notebooks
And things like that I give it like 4 stars | trashes thing | I downloaded the game to see if I could drop some daily goals .when I first got into the den. It’s that me up with a three trial .and I try to get out but .I couldn’t and a tried to look for a no button or a X I had to delete the game, so technically worst planner ever so don’t download. because it’s a scam. | I gave this game 4 stars because this game is probably amazing but it cost money. | Hard to figure out | Hello, soo I’m a high school student that really needs a planner and I saw this on TikTok and it’ SAID “try the digital planner for free” I’m like it’s free but then when I went to download it i started seeing the comments and review , but I’m like give it a chance , and what evryone said in the comments it’s true… hope you guys can value all the comments and think abt it… sincerely, M | This app is terrible don’t get if you see this and get me+ | I rate this a 2 cause you have to pay and it’s so expensive🤬😡 | No me deja usar la versión gratuita | Hay que pagar por todo ademas es super caro 18 por mes osea con 18 dolares me compro un monton de cosas y la app no es perfecta eso es muy caro puede tener hasta demanda( estafa) | I have not figured out how to get this to work | $10 a month for a planner when I could buy a paper one for the same price as ridiculous. I also have no way to preview the app or see what it even looks like and don’t like the way that they’re trying to force you to get a subscription.

I booked a room for today but instead they had it booked for next month, I called orbitz and they were professional and courteous!
And they did a great job to change it to the right date!
I am very happy with orbitz!
I have two medical conditions and had to rent a hotel room to be close to baylor scott and white cause of my eye sight, heart and bone condition!
Very happy with orbitz! | Great place super clean and very near everything around great customer services  nice views | It’s true. A colleague introduced me to ORBITZ that many years ago and I’ve used your business successfully ever since. Grateful. | I made my reservation online. And after many failed attempts to checking through the app that the email reservation kept pushing me to. 
I call customer service. After explain my exasperation to find my reservation. The agent explained that because I made my reservation as a guest without logging in I wasn’t able to use the app to check in. !!
Wow 
The email pushes you to the app and only lets you check in this way. | The app is ok but old booking are kept even after travels are completed, this is very confusing. Apple Pay not always available,  search flexible flights not available…. | Never again will I pay high prices. Never again will I let the man hold me down with inflated rates of vacation corruption. 

They are great!!!😃 | Folks, it was worst experience. Not friendly or proper customer service. They don’t even have courtesy to respect customers. | Es muy difícil encontrar lo que se busca y muy importante la seguridad de nuestra información felicidades | The app is definitely easy to use in terms of search capabilities and making air and hotel reservations. However, there does not seem to be a way to share your itinerary with anyone via sms or email. 
Also it’s not clear why it needs access to my entire iPhone calendar to add trips. | Great excellent experience!!!! | I have been a customer with Orbitz for many many years now, pretty much since their inception. Today I had the most horrible experience with them. I was prompted to take advantage of a discount on a car rental with the rest of my package. It directed me and set up my rental at an airport 45 minutes away from where I actually landed. I walked to the car rental As soon as I left the airport, only maybe three hours after I made the reservation. It was not the correct airport. They then told me that I could not cancel the reservation because it was “past the pick up time” and they also charged me for five days instead of four days of safety protection. I then had to spend over an hour on the phone with them, Just trying to get the reservation canceled that I had made just a few hours before they kept putting me on hold repeatedly, and in the end, could not get me an actual reservation at the correct airport, which led me to having to pay full price for the car and for the car insurance, which is nearly double than what you pay for it at the car rental place rather than through Orbitz. So, not only did they create a situation where I am in a strange city without a car late at night., having to argue with Orbitz after traveling all day. and having to spend a long time on the phone to get it corrected. Even though in the end they were able to cancel the reservation, after wasting an hour of my time, they still were unable to provide me a new reservation at the discounted rate that is supposed to come with my package. So no more Orbitz for me. Not only could this situation have been easily avoided, it should have been easily resolved within 10 minutes on the phone with them. Not multiple holds multiple agents and over an hour of time. Truly truly absurd experience. | Buena app | I booked 2 business class tickets to Oslo and am unable to get a seat. The airline tells me that there may not be one available 
(2TCBUO)
The flight is in December! | I paid through Orbitz for a room at the casino. When I arrived at the casino they didn’t recognize my confirmation. I had to pay for the room out of my pocket so I called Orbitz immediately when I got up to the room.
Orbitz assured me they would get it right. They said I would receive a email and get a refund. 
Well nothing got fixed so I called Orbitz back and Orbitz then said I had to go through the Casino!! Then the casino said I had to go through Orbitz! 
Orbitz STRAIGHT LIED TO ME! Said I would get refund AND LIED! 
I winded up paying the casino and Orbitz for that night so got completely screwed! 
I will NEVER go through Orbitz again and now I warn all my family and friends!
DONT BOOK THROUGH ORBITZ!! | I have used Orbitz for years and so happy with the price, accommodation, flights. It is my go to site when looking for travel and accommodations | Wonderful customer service | We have been through this for 15 years, ups and downs, screams, threats, resolve, and happy moments. I am still EXCLUSIVELY using this website because it’s like my family. I am very happy in the end. | So easy and so reasonably priced | We love using your services. Thank you so much. | Online faster | Don’t call Orbitz customer support number 855-828-3959 it’s some type of solicitation sales agency to people 50 & older (ridiculous). 
My Recent hotel booking I Reserved none smoking but orbitz got me smoking room and hotel charged extra fee for none smoking rm ??. First time ever to pay extra for smoking or none LOL.
It’s not how much I paid extra got me angry but how orbitz messed up my reservation & No way of resolving through orbitz !!!
After many years using orbitz, today is my last day… goodbye orbitz | They show one price but by the time you are ready to buy, the price has increased dramatically.    A bait and switch? | I always come back to it.  Easy, and fast.  Also surprisingly gracious when I once made a hotel reservation that was a mistake, and it offered a refund. | Had better information before I downloaded the app!! | So far, so good | Very clean, great lobby | Very Easy to navigate | I can’t find my upcoming trips. LOL. | Works fast and well. | It’s a beautiful resort with great service. Its “all-inclusive” designation wasn’t what one would expect, as you were limited to certain restaurants, were required to carry papers around for access, and had to report your room number about 100x a day. That was a bit off-putting to us. | I’ve been using Orbitz for a many years long before an app existed. While the app is fantastic, their customer service is outstanding. | Was on the phone with them for a long period of time and kept being out on hold only for them to say they couldn’t honor my credit’s. 
Don’t use as they have bottom of the barrel policies, they do not accommodate you also language barrier with customer service as well | Avoid | The place is clearly rundown and in need of repairs. Door knobs are loose, walls are scuffed up, ceilings are painted with different color paints etc. More unbearable though was how poorly the rooms were cleaned. The bathroom was dirty with hair all over the bathtub and the toilet was also clearly not cleaned near the floor. Gross. | Esta aplicación para mi es la más segura y las mejores ofertas | I been using orbitz for long time ,, and i will  keep this .. trusted . ⭐️ | This B&B was exceptional and the Host (John) and his wife were pleasant to talk with. We enjoyed a much needed weekend escape and found this gem in Havre De Grace. We will be back! Comfy beds, cute room and plenty of outside patios with gas fire pits to take the chill off. Made to order breakfast to cap off the weekend stay. | Muy buena página para comprar ticket a todo el mundo . | I’ve used this app for several years without any issues. I use it primarily to book airline flights, hotel rooms and rental cars. | I used Orbitz for a very long time and they’ve been convenient until having an issue. I was overbilled on sight by a car rental company. After a few support calls an Orbitz agent assured funds would be returned to my card. Weeks later after no refund I was told to go to the car rental company. The run around and lack of support left a bad taste. | Needed to purchase airfare tonight for the SuperBowl so I downloaded the app and proceeded.
It took awhile to go through each phase step by step but was successful.  I’m liking the app most definitely. Wondering why I didn’t start using this app a heckuva lot sooner.
But Thank you for providing it!
Go 49ers! | the price shown will be double upon check out.
and theres a note from $1506 when up $3100  because price varies all the time.
fooling people! | Had a very efficient and pleasant representative.
Thank you so much. | Have not received any of my reward points in the last 6 months | Pretty easy to book, decent pricing. God help you if you have an itinerary charge or need a detailed receipt for something like a business expense, insurance coverage, or just want to look at the details of the cost breakdown. Have had a couple of trip delays cause overnight changes, and Orbitz people are the opposite of helpful,m. I had an agent try and rebook me on a different flight, and spent an hour telling them over and over again that they kept rebooking me on the same (massively delayed) trip I was already on, and then couldn’t cancel a hotel stay hours before the deadline to stay, or reschedule a rental car to a different airport because the airline rebooked my connecting flight to a different nearby airport. | Great app! Use it so much and save so much | About 3 weeks ahead of a trip I made a
Couple of car reservations. Then had to change and hopefully get the charges reversed. Had to call Orbitz and I was treated as a VALUED customer. A great customer relations person, handled everything just as I had hoped. | Been getting monthly emails about my orbit rewards but every time i go to the app to use them, the app is not letting me until they eventually expired.

App shows a message that they’ve extended my rewards but with zero rewards!!! 

Stay away! Better do business with other platforms. | Try to cancel and put in itinerary number they provided and it doesn’t recognize it.",4.78808,390674,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c3/0e/46/c30e4618-116c-e1e1-b204-c63594338f77/93afaae1-15e8-4627-a619-87e522340cb0_EGD_EXP_J23_0006_BHFAP_ORBITZ_IOS_IPHONE_ENG_US_1242x2208_V3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ba/6c/a0/ba6ca09f-f393-cc32-6401-40c32b7732e4/2921e6fa-52a6-4c4f-b2d9-baae11b5c2dc_EGD_EXP_J23_0006_BHFAP_ORBITZ_IOS_IPAD_ENG_US_2048_x_2732_V3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

They also cashed out my Bitcoin when US regulations got tight without giving me the option to transfer to another account, resulting in me losing money.

The bank in general just doesn’t feel like it’s on your side. | I was trying to get this app and start investing but everyone has problems with them and with my experience when I was reading the positive reviews from far away you can see is like a commercial 100% sure that review was write by the employees, use cash app for example and do similar to them because we work hard for our money and I see to many clients here needing their founds and was imposible for them get their money and is not only 1 or 2 client is almost all of them | I opened an account and immediately decided to close it. The initial deposit I used to open the account is now frozen and it is impossible to reach a live person to discuss a refund. Only contact method is chatbot, and they have been zero help. They have my money and refuse to refund. Be careful! Absolutely a scam!! | i heard about this app from a group who encouragd scammers to steal peoples identity. stay far away from this app. good luck getting my endorsement. They even are on here respondng to peoples reviews telling them to send banking information on ""any of our social media. yeah thats genius... somebody could make a social media page that looks like its from revolut and next thing you know people are sending their bank account info to fake people pretntending to be your company. genius. | I typically do not take the time to put reviews on apps. Then again, I’ve usually never had the want or felt necessary or been blown away or was so dissatisfied to submit a review, but this is ridiculous transferring money from my debit card onto this account. My account was temporarily restricted, and then I chatted with someone who said that they were checking a few things and they were trying to do it as fast as they could. It is awful that it takes no less than an hour to verify identity and transactions when every other surrounding bank asks you verification questions, and your account is unrestricted almost immediately based upon those questions' answers; I work in banking, so this irritates me to no end and no excuse can make this valid. | App is run by scammers | The best thing I’ve experienced utilizing the app is early paydays. The initial reason for downloading the app was about the connection to Klover and earning points for cash advances. Unfortunately that has not happened. I will say since I misplaced my card, then added the new card to my apple wallet I am able to use my account. However, I have not received my new card that was expected to be delivered by 4/2/24. It is 4/20/24 & I have not received my new card. I just tried to open the app & I was told my security settings were not on/up to date. Afterwards I was made to login and reset my PIN. Then attempted to link my Klover account to redeem points, to then be told I was not eligible because of my “paid/no pay” account status with Revolut. Yup, I’m officially closing this account. No use for it. | Revolut is simply too slow. Transfer of funds from USD to Euros takes five business days while with Wise it is instantaneous.   Right now, I’ve been waiting over 30 minutes for the “update” to finish.  In the last few months I’ve had to provide new documentation as to my identify and agree to new terms.  It’s all onerous and far more effort than required by other companies. | This app is terrific, especially if you travel and allows you to convert currencies from one country to another. You can transfer money from almost any financial institution to the account and much much more. I do not know where I would be without this service. I wrote a review but felt this one was necessary. Trust me you want to download it. | Love this app | Revolut has been a game-changer for me! Being able to effortlessly send money to my family in Mexico without any fees, especially on weekends, has been a huge relief. The convenience of withdrawing cash from ATMs in other countries without worrying about extra charges during weekdays is fantastic. Additionally, their travel protection and access to airport lounges for a reasonable fee have added a touch of luxury to my travels. The peace of mind knowing that I'll be alerted about any card activity and its location is priceless. Revolut truly simplifies banking and enhances the overall experience. Highly recommended! | foarte bun revolutu si mai ales toate tranzactiile sunt operate rapid🙏 | Their support team is the most incompetent I have ever seen. they can’t even accomplish the most trivial things. they will transfer you between departments, give you pre-caned “no can do” answers and straight up lie to you. anything to just make you go away. absolutely terrible! which is a shame because the app is nice. I have been a customer for years and decided to close my account only because of their awful support.

and I bet you’re thinking im some Karen that came in with crazy demands. no. all I wanted is to have a card shipped to my regular residential address. that’s it. they can’t even accomplish that after 4 attempts. how can you trust them with your money when they fail to do such a basic thing? | Don’t download! This is bank scam!!! I would download this because I just opened my Etsy shop and some criminals DM me saying this is the only way to receive money on Etsy. They would force you to top up big dollars but you would never be able to withdraw/transfer the money to your bank account. They asked for your account # and routing # through ACH transfers which can potentially steal money from your bank account!!! | Failed company. DO NOT GET THEIR CARD, especially the black card. It costs $150 up front and then adding money costs fees. If you try to link to your bank to transfer funds or deposit a paycheck, they hold the funds for 5-10 days (using your money for free) before depositing in your account. 

ABSOLUTELY DO NOT USE REVOLUT. IT IS NOT functional and it is VERY fee heavy/ expensive. | One of the fasted and reliable online bank, I so much have trust in it, I can recommend it 👌 | Trying for 3 days in a row to access my account and I can’t. | nice name for a debit card | Love the bank and the idea behind it but until they change I will have to give it 1* .

If I should echo the other reviews.

1. The customer service experience is just awful. Paying for a pro/vip package and done even have a dedicated line.

2. No protection if anything happens to your money as CS will not do anything. Chargeback claims are being denied without proper due diligence. I had to go to ombudsman to get my money back on a chargeback they claim was denied, turned out the bank did not even submit it and just did internal review and decided there were going to deny it. Got my money back from the merchant without any issues once I called the ombudsman and the FCA

3. Most of the features provided like the insurance is very useless. I put a claim for the insurance in October, there is no telephone number for the insurance company so I am forced to message CS every week for update. It’s been more than 5 months and I am still waiting.

There are just too many issues to list. | I thought this app would be convenient, but there are SO MANY FEES IN EVERY STEP. As all my friends are international I really need an app to transfer money and I thought Revolut would be good, but as I use it to transfer money to my friends for simple things such as food, there are just too many fees. I don’t understand why the fees are so drastic, also, the app is not very user friendly, and takes using many times to even get used to it. 

I hope to find an alternative to this app ASAP so I don’t have to deal with these things anymore. | And the app says my version is not supported (even though I’m on latest version) | Great exchange rate quick transfer to my Mexican account easy to use the app | You’ve gotta give all your personal information before you even get access or try the app. There’s no explanation about what the app will do for you or what you can do with the app upon registration, just ‘give us you phone number and private personal information’. Seems sketchy.  There’s no way to see transparency or build trust. Deleted. | The best bank ever ! | I have family in the UK and I travel there from the US. Amazing for transfers and traveling there | Still waiting for their activation email its been 2 weeks hahah from the beginning it seems worthless | Super recomendada  facil de usar y muchos  beneficios de envíos internacionales  y pagos con tarjeta 100 de 100 | My experience with Revolut so far has been great - the app is easy to navigate, there are instructions for most of the things that we need to know, and their team has been very responsive when I reach out to them with the chat function. | This is the worst banking system I’ve ever used. They will do everything not to help , and will constantly use this chat app which is the worst service ever . 90 days to receive a chargeback request from a gas station- that says it all and I’ve been fraudulently charged many times . Then they will blame everything but themselves 
Don’t do it- if you’re reading this take my word this bank is awful! | Opened the app on April 1, 2024, to find that they are requiring a photo for “verification purposes”… which is odd considering they should have sufficient data for that with a several year old account. Hoping this is a bad April fool’s day joke for an otherwise useful finance app! | Used to have the best customer service , now completely useless | Simply put, impossible to log in because their email and text code verification system does not work at all as it doesn’t send anything. 
For a company in charge of handling financial transactions, this raises a lot of concerns. | Update: I finally received a chargeback. 

No sooner did I have money on my card than it was hit with a charge for 196.15. I opened a case stating that the charge was fraudulent and blocked payments to that merchant. The charge was still pending at the time I alerted you that it was a fraudulent charge. It could have easily been frozen at that time. I went down to the police station and filed a police report for it also. I also contacted Hellcase.com. The responded the next day with a letter stating they had closed the fraudulent account, but the bank would have to do the chargeback. That letter is attached I also contacted Etsy because that is the only place I had entered my account details. They deny any responsibility for the charges. I have subsequently closed my Etsy store because of this. The reason I am so upset with Revolut is because you could have taken a simple action and froze the transaction as I requested. It’s my account. Wouldn’t I know if charges were fraudulent? The charges were still pending even after you wrote me back and said there was nothing you could do. Everyone at Revolt wants to make it my fault for entering my card information on Etsy. Who gets a card and never uses it? That is ludicrous. All you had to do is freeze the transaction and cancel my card. | I’ve tried for two days now to close this account and get my money.  The app does not have the functions available that the company says you need to do so.  Chat help is absolutely worthless and I believe they purposefully make this a tedious and (so far) impossible process.  At this point my money is inaccessible.  I can’t even set up a link to my bank!  This is theft! | I am a Revolut user since many years, I don’t usually write reviews on Apple Store but I have to say that Revolut is the best bank I ever seen. | after using my temporary virtual card to transfer money now i have to verify, for what?? it is a good card hence why i was able to transfer funds. of course there is no available number to call for customer support. | I’ve shown my id and they still can’t verify my identity, I’ve tried multiple times. | Fantastic | Cuenta bloqueada por qué les da la gana sin dar explicaciones y mucho menos poder darlas. | I tried to get accounts for my kids and it was such a nightmare I had to close my account. 7 failed attempts to deposit a check (which would have worked on attempt 1 at any other bank). They also never sent my kids cards and when I asked for them to resend (after the app stopped working) I was told that supply chain issues meant they couldn’t create cards and to check back in a few weeks. NO THANK YOU | Why do I need to change passcode so frequently? Now it asks for  6 digit one, and won’t let me use the one I freq use. | I have updated the app, even unloaded and reloaded and still not able to order a card for my daughter! Keeps popping up a message saying I have to update cause my version didn’t support the option!!?? | Revolut has stolen my money, and they’ve blocked me when trying to retrieve it. Completely shady and I don’t even think this is legal??

Update: two months later and they STILL haven’t paid up. Also, in order to contact customer service, you have to pay to upgrade your account to have access to the “chat feature” and there is no phone number to call. FRAUDULENT. DECEITFUL. | Sad though because I can’t reorder my daughters card that never arrived.. when I try it says I need to update my app which I do and have and it doesn’t change to much about being able to reorder it … anyways besides that I have shared the app a couple times… we will see if I can order one for her eventually! | I travel internationally, use the exchange, spend online and in stores, transfer funds, kids accounts, etc. This card works instantly with very little fees that you pay for the convenience of having all banking options in 1 place. | It’s perfect for anyone to send, they accept all currencies & it’s super easy. Way better then PayPal thank you! | Why doesn’t Revolut pay interest on money in peoples account like normal banks? Best keep substantial funds in a real bank account. | this is the worst app i’ve ever used. i got it to make international transfers and they let me put money into my account but would clear my verification. my money is still sitting in the app and they won’t let me use it. been in contact with the via chat for more than a week and all they ever say is “we will contact you when we have an update” but nothing ever happens. they won’t even go into detail about any issue. just empty apologies. i even contacted them via social DMs and it’s the same thing. they just switch out who’s helping you and every one says the same thing. DO NOT USE THIS USELESS APP.

I understand making money as a company but milking every cent you can at any given moment is crazy I mean I tap the app, get an ad and then three mins later get another ad. I’m in the top 25 in this app and I’ve been playing for like a week or so and I think it’s for obvious reasons. | I love this game I just started so ima a beginner at this game ima try to make this short  so I’m a huge fan about this game it’s my favorite game so far  I love that I can read comments and get to dislike or like and I love how they created this game and how u get to pick your topic it’s really cool for me  and how u get to upgrade I love how they designed it and that’s all I have to say I love the game that’s all | I used to play this game, but one day I deleted it. Today I redownloaded it and it was THE BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!!!! The only problem I’ve had was that the game keeps crashing. I hope you can fix this in the future. Bye! | This game is totally fun . I can make my own channel without YouTube ❤️ | I mean… It’s pretty good. But too much adds, and please add color hair. I have brown hair and there wasn’t any girl hair that was brown. Adds are pretty annoying but overall I’d give it a 4-star rating. | I whanted to make a ishowspeed character but there was no option to have no shirt so please make it were you can have no shirt because ishowspeed don’t were a shirt plz | The idea of the game is fun, and I think it has promise. However, every time I open up the upgrades section or the comments section, an ad pops up when the menu is closed. Even though it is eventually skippable, it makes me not want to upgrade anything, which is bad design. I get the occasional ad, but this is too much. | Remove the timer and just make like there hands are on The computer it takes forever please remove it and I’ll keep playing I quit for now | This game is so fun! I really recommend this game. It’s awesome? 🤩 | Like it’s like fun but when I kept playing it got a little bit boring so it’s like a fun game and boring game at the same time but it’s more fun than the boring but it’s a 9/10 | When I first downloaded the game and I opened it my screen turned black so I deleted and installed it again and my screen kept going black so if you could fix this in any way possible it would be great👍 | it’s a good game very high quality and teaches you how to be a youtuber | I have literally gotten addicted to the game. I’ve played this game for 2 hours without getting bored! Please keep up the good work | Okay, so let me start off, this game is so much fun and I highly recommend it! Super fun and entertaining! Definitely something to play in your free time! But, I’m gonna have to address the elephant in the room. There are WAAAY too many ads, like I don’t mind ads in general, but the amount of ads in this game is unbelievable! Anyway, that’s all! | This game is amazing! It gives you the experience of being a blogger/youtuber just like Mr.Beast, Sniperwolf, and vegan teacher I guess😒😩😒😩😒😩😒 | I love this app a lot. But I just want there to be more customization options for the characters. Like this one hairstyle only comes in black and its kinda annoying. But otherwise this app is great | I looked for a YouTube sim but it didn’t work so I thought it was impossible but then I saw this I love pugs it was the perfect game for me | I cannot describe my love for this game. I bought it once because I needed games to play on my five hour plane ride with no service when I was 11 or 12, and I became addicted. This game is so cutely designed and simple, yet it's so entertaining. Just seeing my cute mini me succeeding in life as a vlogger satisfies the dream I had at becoming a successful YouTuber when I was 8. There's so many funny little features to this game and the customization options are endless. Overall amazing! | I love that you can get play buttons create like YouTube creators [I HAVE MORE COMING SOON] | Got the game a few days ago and whenever I try to access the league it doesn’t work and says I need to connect to the internet to access the league. I am connected to the internet so I’m not sure what to do. Just ruins the whole game honestly. | Nice game wanna coullbe on YouTube | It’s the best | So I was playing it and one time in the comments it said “ Mary me “ which after that I deleted the app And you should too! | I love the game but when I have 68000 subs it shows me the 1000 plage | I like the game but you don’t get too much money and it takes really long for your videos to load.And prices are a bit high.So that’s all I wanted to say. | I gave it a five star review because I want to be a YouTuber when I’m older and this gave the feeling of it | I’ve played this game a while ago when it first came out, and it was nothing like it is now, I thought I’d download it to give it another go, but as I start it up, I can’t even go through the entire tutorial properly without it stopping on a particular part with the fairy or it just won’t let me press any buttons at all, I get off it then get back on just to start to have problems with the review screen popping up, to give the game 0-5 stars, just for that to bug too, so I give it a few stars to stop that problem, now to just have the problem of not being to access decorations, or the shop thing that’s to the left of it, it really bothers me because I thought I could access that stuff through the tutorial, just for it to not even unlock, the I comas just stay grey, I get past 1,000 subscribers just to still not be able to access any of it, So I decide to delete the app and reinstall it, well, that’s when it just went all kinds of wonky, I open the app, and now I’m almost to 20,000 subscribers, but still can’t access the decorations or the store next to it.
Also unlocking the wardrobe, and the pug, though the pug button won’t do anything, and I want to restart but turns out you have to have the store icon just to do that.

Please, if the developers see this, please please make an update that fixes this, I’d really like to play this game but can’t properly because of it bugging. | So I was playing this game it was fun but then I got an ad. I t was a really inappropriate ad for a 4+ game devs please change this. | This game is fun it is super fun  and amazing  and people should be playing this pls give a notice 😁😁🥰 | I decided to give this game a chance, and it was almost worth it. While the game mechanics are simple, fun and easy to understand, the game would be a great time killer while having some fun.

However, the game is super bugged right now. Besides from the random freezing and crashing. The game prevents me from using half of the games features thanks to some kind of bug. So honestly, I haven’t even been able to play the full game. I ended searching for their support pages to learn that the developers don’t post anything about this game anymore. I still reached out via email for help with the bug(s) over a week ago, and have not received a single response.

Finally, while the game has “optional” ads, they are constantly thrown in your face and almost mandatory to get decent progression. They also have a “pay to get rid of ads” option but it doesn’t get rid of optional ads. 

Overall, I’d like to rate to this game higher but due to the bugs I cannot do so. If they ever get back to me and fix the bugs, I’ll add an edit with a higher rating.

For now, I’d recommend finding a different game as this one has died a long time ago. | self explainatory, too many ads. | I can’t buy any upgrades for the decorations or even get into the decorations tab | Ok i LOVE THIS GAME tbh But there's somethin i've always wanted but lets start at the first... Ive played Awhile tbh sooo i always seen somethin i wanted ik U cant do everything everybody wants but ima ask one thing It should be like A real vlogg but not to real I ive always wanted to comment on my comments like respond to my fans and maybe see others and comment but U dont have to do this ive just always wanted to comment with my fans even if there AI but idc😅 soo thats It👀 | Overall a good game | I love it | no description needed. I normally hate multitasking in games but since I don’t lose anything from NOT multitasking and still having so many things on the screen.. As a person with ADHD, this is exactly what I needed. | This game is great because it makes me want to make more videos. On my actual you tube account | It's alright for passing time, just upgrading and waiting. I wouldn't spend real money on it, but it's your call. If they added things like eating and jobs, it might be more fun. Not super exciting, but it helps kill boredom. | It was a good game for a tycoon and the artstyle overall is very cute. My only issue with the game is the overabundance of ads that I felt I had to pay for the adblocker and even with that there are still a bunch of ads flying around the game for “rewards” that I don’t particularly care for. | So I saw a pug a got this game so fun highly recommended it | Buen juego | It’s so cute and sooo fun can u make more games and if you’re bored in a long car ride play this and

Great feature that just causes irritation now. Used to be awesome! App has gotten slower and glitchier with every update. | App is clean looking and easy to book a car, but why aren’t my reservations I made on my computer on the app? Why do I have to have my confirmation number to search for my reservation on the app? Why isn’t it all linked to my Emerald Club number? | Can’t search for a reservation. Click on search bar and the keyboard doesn’t come up. Pretty useless app until this gets fixed. | I can’t currently open this app. | I will never ever ever use National in a million years. They left me stranded at the airport after I GOT IN A CAR, HEADED TO CHECK OUT, only to find out they don’t accept the only credit card I had!! When were you going to tell me that??? Accepted my card on my file for the reservation but NOT in person as I’m leaving and trying to check out! Had I known that I would’ve prepared other options. But to be told that LAST MINUTE and offer nothing to help is INSANE! I will never in a million years use this service again. That is the worst customer service experience I’ve had in my entire life. Now I’m scrambling trying to find alternate transportation. But wow. I’m disgusted and angry. Nowhere on my profile, the reservation documents, etc. do they list there being an issue with certain cards. So good luck!! It’ll be Russian roulette as to whether they like your card or not. But they WONT tell you beforehand in any way shape or form. Happy traveling. | As a long time loyal Executive customer, I was shocked to discover that on a recent update of the National app, customers preference for prepaid gas was automatically selected. And here’s the additional criminal action of National: when checking out a vehicle, the desk or gate employee will not ask or confirm that prepaid gas selection. If a customer calls National customer service while still using the rental, they now cannot correct the situation. Customers can only have this reversed at the original location of the pickup. Also, National no longer provides any way for a customers to call locations.

I am absolutely disgusted how National and many other travel companies (airlines and hotels) are blatantly ripping off customers with more and more tricks. Shame on you SOBs! It was just 4 years ago that taxpayers provided you with billion$, even though you still laid off millions of employees, and now you’re ripping off those same taxpayers. My loyalty to National, Hilton, Delta, and the rest of these villains is DONE. | It says “receipt downloaded and saved to device”. Where?? It’s not in my adobe app. It’s not in my files. It’s not in my photos. I’d love to know where it downloaded the receipt to. | Dear National Rental Customer Service,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received from Assistant Manager Greg Barnette at your location on the night of February 8th, 2024.

Upon arriving at the rental location at 11:30 pm, I encountered issues with my assigned vehicle and sought assistance from Mr. Barnette. Despite being a member of the club and having the right to choose a different vehicle from the Emerald Aisle, Mr. Barnette outright refused to accommodate my request for a vehicle exchange.

His refusal to switch my current problematic Corolla with another vehicle, citing a policy against a ""free upgrade,"" has caused me a significant inconvenience, especially given the late hour and the fact that I am a valued member of the club.

I have video evidence clearly showing Mr. Barnette's deviation from your company's policy and the resulting inconvenience I experienced. This incident reflects poorly on National Rental's commitment to customer satisfaction, particularly for its club members.

I kindly request that you investigate this matter promptly and take appropriate corrective actions to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. Additionally, I encourage you to address this issue with Assistant Manager Greg Barnette and provide retraining if necessary.

I trust that National Rental values its customers, and I hope you will take the necessary steps to rectify this situation promptly. I am considering sharing my experience with colleagues and corporate connections, and I sincerely hope that National Rental can uphold its reputation for exceptional customer service.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely, | Been months that I cannot finish the reservation on the app. Screen goes white and freezes on the final page. Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, fully updated. SIMPLY NOT USEABLE! | App crashes 5 seconds after opening. Tried deleting and reinstalling with no success. I’m using iPhone 14 Pro w/ iOS 17.1.1

UPDATE:
The app appears to work as long as I am not “Signed In” to my account and “Continue as  Guest.” But as soon as I sign in, it crashes. | This app hasn’t been working on my iPhone for about 1yr. Multiple times I’ve reached out to the developer but NO ONE seems to have an answer. Just a frustrating process of being bounced from support team to support team. I’ve been booking my rentals on the company site. Any changes I call the reservation line. Unfortunately this app has removed the flexibility of booking on the go. FIX IT!!! | App doesn’t work on my iPhone. It’s an 11 Pro with the latest iOS 16. It briefly shows a splash screen then closes. Apple Support has reviewed my phone and confirms it’s a problem with the app developer, but National refuses to acknowledge much less fix the problem. Googling the issue shows a lot of complaints. When it did open it had features that made car rentals seamless. I wish they would take the opportunity to actually resolve the issues. | Doesn’t function on phone or IPad almost all the time. No response or extremely slow to complete almost all transactions. The App needs to be stable and useable for a rental nowadays. Emerald checkout etc. All things are updated on my end and the usual fixes don’t work.
Edit
Update yesterday has seemed to fix the problems from the past two months. Thanks crew. | Can’t make a reservation using app. | This app is horrible. It sits there and just loads but never goes anywhere. When you inevitably give up on trying to get it to work and want to go to the browser instead- if the app is downloaded the browser just takes you right back to the app- which doesn’t work! You then either have to delete the app in order to use the browser, or use a desktop. Don’t even bother downloading it, you’ll spend more time trying to get it to load than you will just using your computer. | I have been trying to log into this app for 4 days, it just spins & spins. There is no way to access the app at all.  Deleted. | On the latest ""redesign"". Search works half the time. And once you select a location and dates, the check availability button is greyed out. Tried multiple ways and its same results. Think its broken. what was the point of this redesign? Don't fix if it ain't broken. | With the latest update the National app has lost the ability to search for locations to make new reservations eliminating almost all the usefulness of the app.  Sadly for me I don’t have a backup to go back to, so back to the internet for new reservations:(

Running iPhone 13 mini w/ iOS 15.x.x due to so many iOS fails and battery life issues.  Hopefully the app is updated and working soon. | Upgrades version is a huge step back. Constantly freezes when trying to amend a reservation. Your bored developers now have plenty of work to ‘fix’ the bugs they created. How did this version even get out of beta stage before going live? | The latest update seems to have broken the app.  You can’t move from the home page to any other screen due to the lag time. Extended a reservation use to be extremely easy but no anymore. | App was updated on 10/12 and is literally broken. I select “reserve” and it asks me the location so I type my airport local airport name and nothing happens. I try to select “use my location”…nothing happens. I’m literally unable to reserve a car using the app one would use to reserve a car 😑 | Can’t reserve a car with the app. Seems that’s purpose right? Also super slow. As others said, it terrible. Previous versions were very good. This update is useless. Don’t programmers check anything they release? | Used to be a great app, now it’s just a spinning green circle when you try to rent vehicles since the latest update. Please get this corrected. | Easy to navigate app. Best rent a car company | Does not work, can’t do anything in the app | Cannot book anything the new app. Just about every part of it does not work. When your app works, leave it alone. No I’m forced to book with someone else cause I cannot search for anything on the new app. No airports come up. Nor cities. Nothing. Worthless. | I have downloaded the app several times and it never works. It won’t let me create an account or access anything. I have lots of travel apps like Hilton or Southwest and they work fine this app never works. | PLEASE change the calendar to start with Sunday…you wouldn’t believe how many times I’ve made that mistake being a day off. | Used to be a fantastic app until it was “improved” it last week. Location search doesn’t work so it’s useless for making reservations…which is the whole point of a rental car app. | You guys broke the app. It is currently completely unusable. Do you not test things before you release them? | App crashes/freezes at every screen and does not appear to be any different than the last version except it doesn’t work. | Why after the latest version can I not book a reservation. I input the airport code and the lil circle just goes round and round. It really needs a submit or select button in my opinion | I don’t let apps track my action if it’s not really needed, and for rental car company it is not needed. Trying to start a reservation but the search function is broken. Went to the website and search location is fine…so it’s not a backend problem…it’s poor app testing and deployment. | Multiple updates and a basic airport search doesn’t even populate. Fix the foundations before you give us UI that’s pretty …. | The latest version is very buggy. You cannot modify a reservation. Cone on people fix you crap code. | I am trying to enroll and the app is super glitchy. Super frustrating. I hope their service and getting a car from them isn’t as bad as their app! | App was awesome before the new update. Now it freezes up and I can’t make it past the first screen to make a reservation. 

I have to force quit and open it up again, but it still doesn’t work and I can’t get a quote. | Seriously. How long will it take to build an app that patrons can count on? This one has been sketchy at best. Once again, it doesn’t work! I can’t select the “Check Availability” button or the “One-Click” button after selecting the location, date, & time. 🤷🏻‍♂️ | The app crashes or freezes at every screen. I’ve tried it both on my iPad and iPhone. Not being able to use the app while traveling is a deal-breaker. I will continue to use Avis until National can fix the issues. | Can yall update this app please it is taking too long for stuff to load/pop up even closing out and deleting it and redownloading it is not working at all either. | The manager Rhi and her staff are always courteous, professional and efficient. They go out of their way to deliver consistent five star service. I will continue to rent from National as long as she is here. | Clicking on anything shows loading screen. But it doesn't load. I have to kill the app for it to load | The app has become unreliable. I was over charged on September 20 because the app dropped my Corp number. Can’t get the to change my credit card number despite calling and personally asking for them to change it. | They run out of cars at DAL love and even with a phone call they won’t help me get a car | I am trying to modify my pick up time for my existing reservation.  It keeps erroring out with text character error in the last step.  

Bad application programming causing so much inconvenience.  Please get your programmers test and fix this | Is there anyway to store reservation numbers? when the company books them they don’t show up in my account | App works fine until you show up to rent the vehicle you reserved (and were confirmed with).  Reservations mean nothing thru this app/company and customer service doesn’t give a rip either!  I’ve been a long-time user National and an Emerald member and they’ve just completely lost my trust. | As much as it pains me to say this your website is antiquated and needs to be updated.  It moves between screens without being promoted and it doesn’t recognize Emerald status well enough. | I have been using National & the two major competitors for 40 years.

Looks like they want this app to replace the card. At the Sportsbook mentions option of using the apps digital card to login on betting machines… 

Between excessive password resets and difficulty in locating the digital card, decided to delete the app as it failed to meet the primary criteria. Ease of use.. 

If I need an app to remind me of how many credits I accumulated will download again… | When I go to offers, the APP won’t let me change location through the applied filter options. 
Caesar’s employee has no clue what I’m talking about. 
Can you help??
Right now it’s stuck in Reno, NV and I live in South Lake Tahoe, CA. So I would like to see my offers at Stateline, NV which is only 13 miles from me. 
Please fix. | App hasn’t been updating offers for the past month | The front desk staff was phenomenal. Jose was great in helping me with my room  in getting me a king bed on a very busy weekend. Exceeded my expectations | Just pick a place, review their menu and make your reservation.   Only takes a few minutes to review multiple restaurants. | Very happy for the most part with the app.  Makes booking and other things very simplified.  Also Caesar’s sportsbook app is great as well!  Just looking for my royalty deposit now 👀 | Very misleading, no entry sent for sweepstakes.  Horrible customer service, talk to a supervisor and she says you can do it another way. Why get the App then? Don’t write rules if you that are not correct. | After most recent update, the add to calendar feature is no longer working for reservations. | App is easy to use and makes rooms easy to book.  Only issue i have is on tier multiplier days, the points dont show them multiplied in real time.  Shows regular points earned before multiplied. | Had to log in on a browser to make my payment. App doesn’t register my information. | Great app and thanks for the rewards | Beware of cancellation fees.  Booked at wrong casino location.  Canceled online in less than two minutes, but charged a $56.00 cancellation fee for canceling immediately and 3 days before the stay.  Called the hotel and was told nothing they could do, but told to call a number for billing department.  Billing department told me nothing they could do because it is the responsibility of the hotel.  I was told that I should have called to cancel and not canceled online.  If I had called the fee could have possibly been refunded.  Very sketchy and unclear procedure and policy.  Please be aware.  They offer a complimentary stay be charge junk fees. I am even a Diamond Rewards member and still got hit for a fee.  BTW, booked the same dates at a different Harrahs property.  Loyalty means nothing.  Awful customer service!  Be careful! | Cannot sign in without knowing some reward number I’m sure was assigned years ago. No way to reset account without it. | The staff at Harveys are so friendly and helpful. They make our stay so enjoyable and comfortable. 5 star dining options 
with stunning views! We love all the facilities & amenities ! Carol & Kathy in VIP are the BEST ! | I recently stayed at Flamingo Las Vegas using rewards app to book with my free nights and dining and gaming credit code. After arriving and settling in we went to the casino floor. I scanned my card and there were no credits. I asked at the rewards desk and they referred me to customer support. *Hassle* Now after emailing for over a week they have finally said that there is nothing to be done about it during or after my stay, but I didn’t know until my stay started that my account had not been credited. How would I? Are they in the habit of making the credit available beforehand? 
They have also told me that I must call after making the reservation and confirm the code was credited properly. Just ridiculous. | Used to get free nights like easy peasy

now none, app is glitchy too | Idk what the issue was, but it’s working fine now. | Why did my app change won’t open | Haven’t been able to successfully use the app because it’s constantly crashing. Please look into this! | Please note that your app not working as expected.  The calendar to book for reservations are not being populated it’s just keep spinning doesn’t display the calendar to make reservations. | We booked 2 rooms.  The app will show both under reservations, but you can only act on the first one. It is impossible to switch to th other room. | Easy to use just wish we get few more perks. For Diamond Plus and husband Diamond | We have stayed at Ceasars in Las Vegas several times and the accommodations and Las Vegas experience is awesome. | The update apparently was supposed to fix this, but did not. I have been trying to load September’s hotel booking calendar - but it just keeps spinning. | I Can no longer book the promos with the hotel stay. It used to be simple tap on the promo, book the property and done .  Now I can no longer attach the promo to my hotel booking. I either have to call my host or reservations. A lot of times I book last minute promos. Fix the problem. | My offers are not viewing the same as the screens you see for this app. It’s viewing offers side by side in like square boxes. | What is happening? Rooms and dates will not load. Contact support email link will not load! Please fix | Needs option to add membership card to Apple Wallet so we don’t have to dig thru emails and past reservations to look up membership number. | Touch ID login and direct link from offer to booking are two things I noticed that were working just fine before but no longer so in recent version. | Why do companies keep changing the Apps. ? They make things less user friendly, it’s confusing. My Face ID don’t work, says my password is wrong. Try to Change it, says not acceptable. The only way I can now use it is through the email, where I changed my password to what was suggested. Now that won’t work either, have to click the to “view my account “ in my email. this is unacceptable for a company like you. What was wrong with showing all the offers and we scroll through it. Delete what’s expired or what we won’t use. So disappointed. I wasted so much time trying to figure this out!! | The “Contact Us” in the app is a joke. Completely broken and doesn’t work. The email us link kicks you out of the app and into Safari, where an error page loads. The Call Us link forces you into a ridiculous automated system that asks for specific property information.

How is there no SIMPLE and WORKING way here to contact Caesar’s Rewards customer service? | Can’t book rooms in the app and finding the offers on the rewards page is as inconvenient as possible… bring back the previous app version. | If you don’t want my business, just let me know instead of having your crappy website sit there spinning.  Goal = make customer angry.  Mission accomplished. | Horrible after recent update. Impossible to search rewards. | Caesars not only is ruining their casino experience but now with the latest app update they have managed to screw up their app as well. I used to be a huge Caesar’s fan but they are making it very difficult for me to want to give them any of my business anymore. Sadly farewell. | Hate interface of the the latest upgrade.     Hard to see and plan my offers for multiple casinos.    Bring back the old version.  #7star | It's bad enough reward offers and benefits have gone down the $h!tter....and now the app is at it's worst! Sure it may look visually clean and updated BUT now there is literally more steps (takes longer to navigate and loads slow) just to view any now horrible offers which I can not even see as cllicking on ""book offer"" takes me directly to the filter or list of hotels and pricing ""grid"". Is Caesars undergoing new managment or ""desperate"" changes? You guys are going down the wrong path.  App review based on latest ios update as of 5/17/2023. | I really like Caesar’s rewards for free hotel stays and free play on slots | Greatest place to play, great food, good people close to home, I tell all my friends about this place… can’t wait to come back… | They didn’t credit the rewards twice and customer service was really bad | Mystery multipliers are extremely misleading. I picked a present with 300x reward credits multiplier and received 2x credit multiplier.  That is not right and should not even be advertised or promoted as such. | Like the apt. Hope I will be able to bet on ky durby this year. | I’ve been trying to use this app for 3 months and it never even opens. It just says “we’re experiencing problems right now”. For 3 months. It’s horrible. | Easy to work with. | Love the convenience! | I wish you have a free casino play like Hard Rock Casino that you enter rewards card information and play for credits rewards. Also Vegas Casino have that same thing and it’s great. Rewards for like hotels , food , and ext.
My Vegas, Vegas Bingo , and other casino games. Thanks! | I have been using the rewards app for over a year with no issues. I tried signing in and says my account is deactivated. There is no assistance from anyone at Ceasars that can assist with this issue. They want to reset my password which I did and can only use the ceasars.com page. Completely USELESS app! | Currently cannot login since the update. I can log in online but cannot log in on app. Continues to loop and tell me to reset password or contact customer service. Even went to a Caesar’s property to discuss it and they had no idea how to fix it. | Can log in on my computer but when I enter my credentials into this app it just says it can’t authenticate. To contact support you have to log in! Use to work fine but current version is useless… | Unable to have my data display.

I don’t know where this rudeness is coming from. | Thanks 🙏 for the trip | The app works fine.  Bus service has been very good.  Sometimes, though I’d get confused thinking since I booked on Greyhound site it was a greyhound bus, whereas it’s a fly bus. | booking is easy witht the app it will determine the cheapest route inline with traffic and construction,! that is great because here in Texas y'all new people do not do well with GPS instructions and just sit in traffic.... | Easy to understand — able to accessed without drama, tears, crying, or arbitrarily rejected payment information. | I’m glad. | They charge extra fees (penalty) for rescheduling/cancelling your trip. It doesn't matter whether it's minutes or weeks prior to the trip.
Customer service representative chats like a robot & keep tossing links & apologies repeatedly. ""WE CANNOT WAIVE THE FEES.""
This is my first & last time I use greyhound. | I will take the bus from Sacramento to Reno every 4 to 6 months to see family. I love the ride.  They have great drivers and the passengers have been ok too. So my experience has been excellent.  I don’t live in Sacramento but flying there and taking the bus will generally save me $50+ even after paying for a ride to greyhound    Just have to make sure you have at least 5 hours between schedule because greyhound doesn’t have good on time performance from what I’ve experienced | So easy to use | To purchase a ticket was fast easy and quick.
Appreciate 🤩 | Makes it easy to search and buy tickets | Tried to book a ticket in advance but trips was not available so then I go to the website and they magically appear. | I am traveling with greyhound bus, I started coming on the 18th of March, the first bus I was on the driver was very disrespectful, and went to the point he started cursing me out, and the customer service is so bad, if you need help there’s nobody there to help you, I got to Chicago at 12:35 just to hear my bus was delayed until 6am , okay I waited, they said update your ticket and mines was updated already, when the bus got here they said me and my daughter can’t go because we not on the list and I have work in a few hours, this is outrageous now I have to wait for 8:15 to get on a bus and I’m going to miss work, very poor service you guys have! | App doesn’t work. Won’t let me input anything. Waste of time! | Greyhound Dallas   Lo peor 🫵🏻🤮 acostumbrada a dejar a los pasajeros para volver a vender el boleto. Estafadores hay que demandarlos pronto Pésimo 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 | Super easy! | I’ve ridden three times thus far. The first bus was initially cancelled and was a huge hassle. The second was fine. The third one came to the stop and then had issues and got cancelled. The lack of dependability is appalling. Aren’t the buses checked before they arrive at the station!? If there is any time sensitive matters, I’d advise against using Greyhound if possible. | I have been traveling Greyhound for many years and I have had a lot of Faith in Greyhound Operations. I provided only 4 stars because I am hoping and praying that Greyhound gains its reputation of service to the people that choose to or have to travel by Bus! Thank you for your service to all employees | Thanks for fixing the crash bug!

Please fix. As app opens with buffer circle it crashes after one second. I’m using an iPhone 15 Pro Max running iOS 17.3.1. Thank you. | The latest update you put out makes the app work normal again thanks. | The latest update keeps crashing. | When I was in process of booking and had selected seats, suddenly the app stopped working. When I tried to resell them those same seats again, it showed them as taken. So I couldn’t get those same seats back. Seams to be a glitch in system. | I had to add my card to my Apple wallet to complete the payment because I kept getting errors, but it’s the best option available! | Worst Service Ever. They intentionally do delay's | They are always late I have booked twice and each time the bus is delayed last time it was delayed for 5 hours. | I have never seen such a shameless and disgusting company. I arrived at the station fifteen minutes early and was told that the bus had already left. | Took a bus from Pittsburgh to Chicago. Lost my luggage!!
Horrible customer service and no one answered my questions.

You’re luggage can be easily stolen and customer service seems to be a part of it!
 
Never travel with valuable items with GREYHOUND | Pretty easy to navigate. Cut an dry. Think my 90 yr old grandma could do it if she knew what a cell phone is. | WANTA SAY THANKS | I found this to be a very convenient, easy way to purchase a Greyhound Bus ticket in the privacy of my home at my leisure. I greatly appreciate this app and the ability to buy a ticket this way thank you Greyhound sincerely, Daniel M Emminger. | Greyhound always finds a way to leave their travelers stranded with late notifications of delays or cancellations. | Constant delays and terrible refund policy. Use Amtrak or Peter Pan instead. | ONE WORD - T E R  R I B L E !!!!!
MADE ME SICK!!!!! | I would like to file a complaint about a recent trip I booked. I scheduled transportation of a FlixBus for 12/27/2023 which was scheduled to leave at 10:25am from Lafayette, La. I arrived well on time and an unknown bus did arrive; however, it was not labeled as FlixBus and the bus number was completely different than the one listed on my reservation. The one shown on my reservation was 2211; the one on the bus that arrived was something like 9988 and it was a limousine service truck. After a whole, I eventually asked the driver if he was going to the designation I requested and he said yes; however, he refused me getting on because he claimed that my name was not shown on the reservation and I would not be insured. This is absolute horrible customer service because I did not receive any updates about the bus number being different than what was shown on my reservation. Now I’ve had to book a new bus and it was more expensive. I want someone to contact me and refund me for my previous booking since my reservation seemed to somehow how be lost. The driver could have simply scanned my QR code to verify for sure. Because of his lack of effort, I would like this to be addressed directly with him. This is horrible experience and I’m in no way pleased! | The bus don’t have a system to supervise the real sitting condition for customers so just don’t pay for the reservation.

I just booked the bus’s seat one day and a black guy just sit on my seat and pretended his seat also occupied by another. Once I tried to talk with him, he became super rude and other guys just told me to sit on other seat.

So don’t waste money on reservation of greyhound or just don’t buy the ticket, or maybe you will experience a terrible trip. | I would never travel on greyhound again how dh can they make a bus trip but it’s ok for a bus driver to to be absent for the holiday, if that was the case they should’ve found somebody reliable. Yall | I’ve used greyhound for years to get me around to wherever I wanted to go and most times it was successful or less issues. Not this trip to Boston. I didn’t pay money to be late and lose money on top of going to an Celtics game. Last time I’ll use Greyhound! Bus and delays was 3 + hours late and it’s “ we’re sorry you had that unfortunate experience and there’s nothing else they can do of that situation but hope to restore trust with greyhound in the future “. Nope, don’t waste y’all monies on greyhound! | Does not function | useful as the website. thank you and keep up the great service. | The people who work the Greyhound work as if they aren’t supposed to be driving people to their destinations ON TIME. I’m waiting for my bus that’s supposed to leave at 8:15 they didn’t have a driver for another 15 mins. And those drivers that are here when asked about why there is a delay give attitude as if we chose their jobs for them. | Normally I have very smooth and nice ride, but I had twice bad experience of broke down between New York and Baltimore in the past couple of months, waited for around 3 hours each time. | Update your pickup locations! | Unfortunately I had a situation where I booked with greyhound and couldn’t leave at that time anymore so within 15 minutes I was able to get 75% of my money back in form of voucher and purchase a new ticket with new times. | It s was all good on bro | Too Expensive | They canceled bus without intimation, when I called their support they just left me on hold for 30 min. Any important journey don’t book Greyhound 👎 | Great service…. | I traveled to MS to see family, and had to catch the bus nearly 2 hours from where I was staying. Missed my original bus and struggled to get any real help with my situation. Greyhound is no longer customer friendly, it’s like riding a vehicle that no one is responsible for. | Shown at start of booking were only Visa and American Express.
May cause some to seek another method of transportation-I thought of it but with time on hand I searched further finding many other payment methods. | I’m letting you know right now if you think naw these reviews can’t be that bad ima try it out your wrong these reviews can’t not fathom how terrible greyhound bus services really is if your a very patient person and I mean monk type of patient then hey give it a shot but be expected for you bud to be delayed or late not only that if you are arriving somewhere for example that gonna take two days or even four of my your on for a ride because most likely there gonna push that back further then your worst barber you ever had that push your hairline back.",4.83701,167245,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f3/8f/1b/f38f1b3c-9343-6c42-4c4e-b7410228dde0/37f4edcf-1d5c-47ba-b048-a422c1fe08b5_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d5/f0/57/d5f057ef-211e-4345-1714-fc7fe54ad688/44c1f9c5-7777-4629-aca4-874fdfe78da8_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/4d/d6/5f4dd609-0b33-f4ca-dd00-372005c85f5c/ac2b04c5-192a-4ccc-bf98-56bed3c87f1b_31.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b3/9f/0b/b39f0b4c-3a5a-d1db-7f26-4c6c636700c1/0e7e0d03-c9a1-4763-8a35-64a849366022_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/56/df/52/56df52be-9b18-831a-61d7-d576e07cf653/592b4334-b991-4ab5-a265-ce920fe38d4f_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7b/96/35/7b96354e-2b5f-5121-6ecf-93e1d94c9e3c/64071bf2-5422-48d3-b5a2-616b00bade23_7_en_S.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Shame on you Subaru. Disgraceful | The MySubaru app is a must have when you buy your Subaru. All the features like locking or unlocking the doors or remote start are a must have especially in the winter. | When you schedule a service appointment with the app it does not confirm it via email or text nor does it show in the app that you already made one, so you end up scheduling multiple appointments not knowing if any of them went through. Fix this basic feature! | App says oops cause it says my vehicle doesn’t exist in app. | This application is pretty basic and after initial contract expire should be free unless they improve the interface and make it more advanced like having an integration where you can start your car using Siri. | In places where the cell network is reliable with ATT cell it works very well; however it does not seem to have the ability to roam to other carriers so it does not work at my home in a rural area despite having cell service with another large national carrier. Nor does the car respond via WiFi even with a secure connection. 

Would also be nice if it had the ability to lock the doors following a manual start; this would be great for leaving the vehicle run to warm up or cool down securely. 

I have not figured out how the default start setting is set up. It seems like it does what it feels is best but that is not always best for a situation. Sometimes I get heated seats on a warm day. Sometimes the heat is cranked up when I get in. But when I use the editable settings it reliably sets them every time. So nice to have things warmed up or cooled down when I leave work. | First time ever having an auto start. Then to have it on my phone?! Amazing. Start this bad boy up from the 2nd flr bedroom. Love it | The app developer should seriously consider adding a door lock reminder capability to the app. Other car apps have the feature and it’s a life saver! It would be really helpful to know when you’ve forgotten to lock your vehicle, especially in high crime areas. | Remote start is worth whatever we pay for the service. but it does seem like a high price when we don’t use any of the other features anymore. | I enjoy the ability to change the temp before starting my car. I also like that if I forget my keys I can still open my doors with the app. The only problem I have is I wish it had an option to be on the Apple Watch. When I have my keys in my backpack and phone in my pocket walking out of work it would be nice to be able to start my car from my watch when I have my hands full. | Everybody that has driven in my car has said it’s absolutely great and everything I told them about was true. I will never buy another car other than the Subaru Forester because they are the best. They’re the safest and I believe one of my family members. We’re in a Subaru, they be here today so keep doing a great job with everything that Subaru is especially the safety
L EVANS | I wish you could change your settings without having to start your car | In the winter being able to start the car and have it warm and defrosted while finishing breakfast is great. Tonight I wasn’t sure if it was locked. From the security of my bedroom I was able to lock the car. Thanks Subaru! | This app is just what I would ask for. Intuitive, dependable. I’ve been spoiled, starting my car remotely, making sure the doors are locked if I am in doubt. Terrific. | I like this app and it does what it’s supposed to do, but it would be really great if it supported Siri Shortcuts so that you can utilize your watch or action button on your phone to remotely start the car or unlock and lock the doors. | This app is absolutely amazing. | I love this app as we have 3 Subarus - 2 outbacks and 1 Impreza and I use this app often.

I was looking for service history and realized that it is shown only for my Impreza and not for the two Outbacks.

This is quite a useful feature to know when it was last serviced.

I have been doing Service with Subaru dealers for the Outbacks and I assume that they would enter it 🙂 | Crosstrek Wilderness 2024. Error code SER-4357 when trying to start my car. 

At least if you create and app for the car at least help us with the app don’t make us call dealer or try to make us search for possible solution on Reddit.

Thank you hope you fix the app soon and give us more information what we can do when a problem come up. On the other hand let us by pass warning on the app and car. 

Example windshield wiper fluid, I won’t go to the dealer to add water and if I don’t have the time to add up the liquid and the car keep giving fault like is the end of the world | It does what it’s supposed to. I haven’t had issues so yeah I like it and as you can see I give it 5 stars | It works to do basic things like remote start your car…but it falls short. The UI is kind of ugly, you can’t select whether to turn on cooling seats vs warming, you can’t save multiple different settings like one for summer and one for winter, etc. It takes what seems like an eternity for the app to run because it has to start with its opening title screen. Oh yeah, it also costs like $15/month just to be able to remote start my car which is about all this app is useful for and even that it doesn’t excel at. When compared to other competitors, this app is not nearly as useful. It makes me not want my Subaru anymore if the tech is this crappy. I don’t know where all the 5 star reviews are coming from…maybe new people who haven’t used many apps before or they haven’t gotten hit with the monthly fee to use it yet. | It would be better if it could start through apple watch or Sri. | I am a professional, dog walker, and I use my Subaru as my work vehicle. This app generally works for locking doors, but the climate control function almost never works. Unfortunately, that’s my main reason to use the app.  So I never really use it and in my opinion the app is mostly worthless | Great app , starts car and helps with service appt | I love that I can start my car from this app! It’s my favorite option! Although you can also lock/unlock doors. Turn off lights etc. I’ve only had my vehicle for about 2 weeks, but this option is so worth it! | App needs to be smoothed out, feels like a webpage enclosed in an application. | Compared to other manufacturers this app is definitely lacking! My husband has a different vehicle and his app has TONS more features.  Shows the status of the car, if it’s locked , unlocked, running, not running and more. Plus the car is NOT a top of the line manufacturer!   Also they need to make this compatible with Apple Watch.  Get with the game Subaru!!! | Because I find it difficult to setup, not user friendly in my humble opinion. | I love my Subaru but this app is not it. I spent an hour digging through every tab and menu trying to find simple features I would expect to find in a paid subscription like this. There is no way to see if your doors are unlocked and you do not get notified if they are left unlocked after a period of time. You are able to initiate a lock/unlock in the app but often get an error when trying. 

In order to find details like gas level, tire pressure, vin number, odometer reading, car location, etc, you have to dig through menus and many of these features are on different pages. It’s honestly so frustrating to use. I used to have a Kia, and their app and subscription service is miles ahead of the MySubaru app. I feel like I’m using something that was designed in 2010 by an engineer and a product or UX designer was not consulted. | It’s always good to have get current information regarding your vehicle. The Periodic reminders and notices are helpful in maintaining the health of my vehicle.   Keep up the good work Subaru. | Simply love this app | I loved being able to check my vehicle status and see that my doors were locked and windows were closed. Where did that go?! Frustrating that I had it when I first got my Outback and now it is no longer a feature in the app. Very disappointed. | I own a new Subaru Outback Widerness   Great car. I am in Canada, I bought it in Canada it is a Canadian car. But I can not get “ My Subaru” Canadian!  I have tried everything. When I download the American version it will not accept my log in info. I cannot find the Canadian version of this app.
HELP!! | Clunky, only works sometimes, takes too many steps just to tell the car to “charge now”, which one should be able to do by saying “charge now”! This is probably the most ineffective app I have. | I cannot live without this app! | The best car we’ve ever owned. The safety features, the design, drivability, the app, absolutely everything about our RuRu is amazing. | This little car is everything I dreamed it would be and some my husband and I love it | The app started throwing an error code a couple months ago. At first, it continued to work after I x-ed out of the error. Now it stopped functioning completely. 😟 | I wish we could add an Apple Watch feature so I can leave my phone behind and take it on the go. I'm pretty sure it’s a simple software update. Can we please add? 

Thanks | Awesome | I would have given 5 stars.  The only problem I have with the auto start is I wish you could run it for longer than 10 minutes.  Up to 20 minutes would be ideal. | The app is easy to use and really puts my mind at ease. | This app is so convenient to me in the summer when it’s hot I can turn it on from my office and when I come downstairs it’s cool down and the same for the cold
Months | It’s works and is very convenient. Love Subaru and the app doesn’t disappoint | Easy to understand and use.  Works well and is responsive. | I absolutely love this app. I use it almost on a daily basis to start my vehicle before I go out side. The presets are awesome, but it is missing one thing the Apple Watch features they have it in the Solterra app but not for the majority of us users. Just because we didn’t buy a new EV doesn’t mean we should be punished with lack of features. Come on Subaru let us use our Apple Watch as a passkey already so I can stop carrying my keys everywhere I go! We need this! And allow us to start our Subaru with our Apple Watch.. | Subaru chooses to partner with Starlink that charges an exorbitant amount just to get a monthly health report, and allows you to remotely start your car. Stupid! | I love my Forester!  I had a few outback’s before I switched to the Forester- loved them too.  I drive for my work and in a northern climate it will go anywhere on the back roads for me. The Forester just provides more room to carry items which is really helpful. I will always buy a Forester | Úng dụng rất tiện ích | Love it. | Love it

Smooth ride and felt safe and relaxed. Very convenient also. | Quick pick up, smooth ride, and chill music. I trust Waymo more than traditional taxi services. | I thought this was against the App Store rules, but I guess I’m behind the times. This is extremely annoying behavior and I’ve disabled all notifications from Waymo. Let’s see how much this impacts my ability to use the app. | Thanks for Fun:) | Safe, fun and felt futuristic. Wish Waynore was in more places! | The ride was fabulous. We face timed family back home to show them the driverless car. Felt safer than with a regular driver. Would definitely take it again. | Embarking on my maiden voyage in a self-driving car was truly remarkable. It was a moment filled with a blend of curiosity and uncertainty, as the absence of a human driver felt unfamiliar. Yet, amidst this novelty, there was a surprising sense of reassurance, a testament to the advancement of technology in ensuring safety and efficiency.The experience served as a reminder of the constant evolution shaping our lives, offering a glimpse into the future of transportation. While the traditional notion of a driver at the wheel may seem ingrained in our psyche, embracing innovation opens doors to new possibilities and experiences.Though initially unconventional, the journey left an indelible impression, sparking a desire to delve deeper into this emerging frontier. Without a doubt, it’s an experience I eagerly anticipate repeating, as each ride unveils a world of innovation and inspiration. | I signed up w my google work email 4 months ago and am getting “account unavailable.” Forced to sign up with personal email and start the waiting game all over again. Wasted 4 months 🥲🥲 | I’ve used this app to take my first Waymo trip and it was very pleasant & accurate. The ride offers a wide variety of music or you can choose to use your own music via Google. I would recommend this app if you are really not feeling in the mood to drive, be a passenger for once. | Like a horse heading home, it took a path and proceeded with caution.   Made it after a struggle with seat belts.  Scary at first, Funny when I look back at it! | Such a cool and fun way to travel! These guys know how to create a great experience. | I intentionally gave myself lots of time and glad I did.  After two cars cancelled, the third showed and worked great.  Now I’ll need to be sure the charges for the first two cars don’t clear.

Other than that, the entire experience was cool and easy. | The transition from skeptic to believer is never easy, but my first ride went seamless. It was smooth and felt safe. Will be trying it again. | After using Waymo a few times, I found it really easy to use the app and a great experience in the car. Such a wonderful service and a good value. | This actually works. | So easy to use and worth the ride. | Love using Waymo in SF. Super safe travels each time. Doesn’t cancel on you, always clean, and the added features that warn you when a car or motorcycle is approaching when you are exiting the car, that saved me a few times!  Can wait for Waymo to be everywhere. God speed :) | My eight year old niece and I wanted to take a ride just up to the nearest store and back. It took us to the store, but instead of coming back the same way, it took us a few miles in the opposite direction and then once it got on the main street coming back the right direction, it’s stopped in the middle of a 40 mile an hour street. The vehicle behind us almost hit us. Then the car proceeded to go 10 miles an hour for 6 blocks until it reached a red light. We did not know if it was going to stop at the red light because it was obviously malfunctioning. We called customer support while this was happening and they said all they could do is file the report of the complaint. It was absolutely scary not knowing what could possibly happen. This is not a perfect technology. I will never ride with this company again. | ⭐️ Safety - Not only does the ride itself feel safer, as a woman, I also know that no one is going to try to pick me up or copy down my address. 
⭐️ Comfort - The drive is so much more comfortable than human drivers. So smooth! 
⭐️ Privacy - I love that I can talk on the phone, meditate, do my makeup, or sing along to my music in complete solitude. 
⭐️ Ease - The app is so easy to use. The count down when my ride comes is helpful. The little touches like your custom initials on the car are so fun. 
⭐️ Smell - Waymo smells soooo good by comparison to my Lyft rides. No body odor. No cigarettes. No pot. And the cars are always clean! I feel so posh cruisin in my Waymo.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ JOY! - I look forward to my Waymo rides. They’re more fun than any transit I’ve used before. Thank you for creating such a miraculous, safe vehicle. Now let’s bring them to the rest of the world! | The way to go!! | Way(mo) better than Uber or Lyft!  The future is here.  Super smooth and enjoyable. | Waymo is a fantastic option! I Take them at least once a week. I love the experience and 95% of the time the rides are absolutely perfect. 5% of the time could use a smidge of adjustment but still just fine. | This is definitely my new way to travel! 10 out of 10! | I’ve requested multiple rides at various locations. The waymo will pull up and not allow you to uock it and then leave to send you back to the cycle.

I’d recommend using another rideshare app until they figure out how to fix this issue.

I’d also add that the support is at the behest of the car and can’t override it, which makes it virtually useless. | Our family is in Scottsdale for a spring break excursion, when we witnessed these vehicles moving about and had zero clue as to what they were. Googled it, and found this to be the newest wave in getting places without driving- without ANYONE actually driving. It was an adventure, experience, and something we will never forget. Our children loved it, we loved it, and it was all TOO EASY! We want to now take this again before our trip ends, and were wondering when each vehicle may have its own personalized name and a possible short conversation! EXCITING!!

-Ry | It’s more than a ride it’s a Babe Magnet! | The car got stuck at a location find a vehicle not allowing the truck to get out the car or the parking lot. Then the car drove off with my items inside of it not allowing me to grab my items or even retrieve them. When I came back to the car terrible service will never be using again. | My ride randomly got canceled mid trip. Just as I was talking this up it crashes on me. Probably never using this app again. They had the audacity to check why my next ride share was taking so long…when they canceled my trip…. | I felt safe and comfortable. I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience with Waymo. Highly recommend! | 3 rides! I trust it more than a human driver I took a nap on the way to my friends house. I hope to use for long haul rides just need to be able to stope the car for restroom / food breaks . Smooch love you Waymo!! | Amazing service | As an attorney I’m always skeptical, but this was everything it’s chalked up to be. Smooth ride, quick, and easy to use. I wasn’t sure what to expect or how to use it but the app and the whole experience is user friendly. I can’t wait for the next opportunity to take one! And it was reasonably priced. | I just rode in my first Waymo One car. I can it rave enough about it! It felt extremely safe. Safer than 99% of any Uber/Lyft rides and drivers. It was such a smooth experience from ordering the car, the car arriving to the correct pickup spot, the smooth introduction, ease of use of music while riding, the fun solo dance party while driving, and the drop off. I've never done a self driving car and this was an amazing experience! I would choose this over a human driver any day! | Hey, less nerve wracking than I thought! | Just try it and you’ll see. Safer, more convenient, better for the environment. I mean it’s terrifying when you first get in but no this really is, and should be, the future. | The map wasn’t working to find my address for drop off. | Love the keep the window open switch. | Wowzers | Safety, comfort and quality are some of the characteristics that you can feel when you use these self-driving waymo car. AWESOME | Perfect service. Couldn’t imagine anything better. | I don’t love that a Google account is needed for sign up, but it’s not surprising since Waymo shares the same parent company. I’m also slightly apprehensive about sharing location details knowing Google’s less than perfect reputation on privacy. However, after taking a few rides, I’m impressed with how well designed and helpful the app is. I quickly got through the learning curve of taking my first self-driving taxi ride. I hope the live activities feature becomes developed more, because seeing live updates of the arrival time in the Dynamic Island and Lock Screen is such a key feature that’s missing. Also, an Apple Watch app that allows users to unlock the vehicle would be super helpful. | The only negative feedback I have is find a way for the rider to be able to connect to the vehicles stereo system. But other than that the un-added pressure of having to talk to a human is the best to me because I don’t have to think of what to say or feel as though I’m going to offend anyone. Will be using again. | We had clean vehicles, all were jaguars. Very smooth. Driving and felt very safe. Exceeded expectations and you don’t have to tip or listen to annoying stories, or being in dirty vehicles, or have fear of personal safety. | Waymo went over 2500 ft away from designated pick up with only 5 minutes. Called support to add time and agent immediately hung up on me and had to request the 2nd agent because of this the 2nd agent couldn’t add extra time bc the time expired. The agent said I had to call another Waymo myself when it was the apps fault and app still ended up charging me. Lyft had similar prices and way faster pick up times. | Blast your music and the heat to your liking, no driver talking to his cousin on the phone the whole time | This was our second ride while visiting phoenix for the Alliance Conference. Very interesting. Ride was smooth music was entertaining. We recorded and had a great ride. On our 1st ride it stated that you can sing and they won’t listen, but the song we were listening to said the word break and WAMO breaked! It does listen and that’s a great thing, it just wasn’t from us singing, only from the song. We enjoyed both rides and glad we had the experience to share with others. Thank you Waymo, it’s Waymo than we expected!!! | Whole experience was great. My date was very impressed, we mated immediately after our ride. Way to go, Waymo! | Other ride share apps added surge pricing to encourage more DRIVERS to come on the road - this is not a problem waymo needs to solve because they entirely manage the supply.

$29 for a few mile ride AND a 14 minute wait? it’s no wonder that municipalities are pushing back. 

this used to be my default way to look for a ride and i find myself checking other services now. 

if you want to beta test in my city, do it without opportunistic price gouging. | The entire experience from start to finish was enjoyable. The ride felt safe and secure from the moment we got into the vehicle. Two friends and I enjoyed a 15 minute drive where we observed the vehicle driving in traffic making a lane change that was completely safe andthe lane control or traffic lights. While I think this is the wave of the future, it really should be the wave of the present for safety and predictability. I give this five stars, and we are very proud to engage in this new form of transportation.",4.96124,19607,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f8/01/54/f8015402-dcce-a648-bbe9-10cc3db000c7/73fdb1f6-a3aa-437a-af7e-2b17cadda2ba_screen-01-iPhone-8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/db/22/de/db22de26-176c-253e-7271-36812afec04f/860b198f-9be9-4116-80f9-bae7bea78e3d_screen-02-iPhone-8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f3/1a/bc/f31abc45-cbb6-2c1f-89ab-f3b17da116ee/0129c776-94b3-49b8-af40-56f183758d33_screen-03-iPhone-8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/81/53/7c/81537c4e-09c0-38fe-1ee9-5d735e61f723/df7deb1d-0460-4f0c-ac53-a773f08fbf08_screen-04-iPhone-8.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/20/e3/54/20e3542e-6db9-4166-1957-eb2d934f7d4e/1a3bf148-c487-49bc-b01f-7881ace42973_screen-01-iPad.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/fe/32/ec/fe32ec87-baa1-e12b-a464-a8e1c993d822/2cef24bf-f59e-44ba-845e-090f8ba1caf6_screen-02-iPad.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/da/b7/c5/dab7c5cd-234c-ecbb-e965-7bd328c2c7f3/79176952-44f5-4bad-919e-632d613f64a0_screen-03-iPad.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"
