Definitely will continue to book all future trips thru Booking.com | Excelente App | I absolutely love this app, and they really have your best interest of saving money and give you a place for your stay whether you have little money or a big money, they would definitely take care of you | Great source to find the accommodation will use in future | Very good and clean  Thank you DHRUV | It was simple to make a reservation, cancel it, book another and then make changes without a problem. I‚Äôll keep using Booking to make reservations in the future. | The Best Apps for ever | My app to book hotels! Love the free cancellation option and the discounts you got for previous booking plus free taxi rides from airports to hotels.  Love it! | This app is exceptional. I never have problems using it and finding what I need. | A useful app and very good | Our host was so friendly, and went out of his way to help me retrieve my daughters cell she lost in cab!! Apartment was beautiful, clean, had washer/dryer. Apartment building near many restaurants, and walking distance to hot spots | I just love this app when I travel! It makes it easy to find good places to stay within my budget. No hassles and customer service is great too. | Me encant√≥ el lugar muy limpio buena atenci√≥n lo recomiendo | Horrible support from booking.com.   This whole company is a sham!  Hoped this would make my life simpler and be a place to manage any trips I may have but it has turned into a fiasco!     If you ever have problems there is no way to contact them directly.    Booking.com encourages hotels to not allow cancellations or hotels ratings will be lowered.    Talk about working against the customers.     I will make any future reservations directly or through the hotel chain directly.      

Very disappointing! | Once you give your credit card and make a reservation you won‚Äôt get your money back if you try to cancel . Booking.com and Comfort Inn Palo Alto . Both blaming each other that they won‚Äôt drop the charge | Gor creating such a wonderful experience for me with tailoring 2 gorgeous outfits for me and my Mom. I so appreciate all your time and energyüôèüåéüíï | I recently stayed at the property and had an excellent experience. The apartment was clean, modern, and well-equipped with everything I needed for my stay. 

Lina was a fantastic host, very responsive and accommodating.

 The location of the property was perfect, close to shops, restaurants, and public transportation.

 I would highly recommend staying at luxuries villa Jeddah  for anyone visiting the area. I will definitely be booking with her again in the future. 

Thank you | Amazing experience, great landscaping and clean rooms. Very friendly and welcoming staff. | It was only 1 block from the beach. Everything was on point with everything needed.  All with the feeling of being in a home. | The staff was wonderful and welcoming as well as the rooms being clean and comfortable | This company steals your money. They rarely deliver on anything and customer service creates inane rules for you to jump through to try to file a claim. Avoid‚Äîdon‚Äôt use. They‚Äôre a bogus evil scam company that shouldn‚Äôt be available on the App Store. | –û—á–µ–Ω—å –ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–Ω–æ —É—é—Ç–Ω–æ

The only way I can access is through the verify me link which opens in a web page. From web page it says view my confirmation in the app‚Ä¶ which begins the password incorrect, reset cycle. So frustrating. | Flight options disappears after opening App! I have called for help, but customer service is of no use! | Simple , quick and easy to make a booking | Great place and location, great service and prices.

The pools are nice and the ‚Äúloud music‚Äù that I read about in other reviews wasn‚Äôt so annoying as they said, but still I would suggest this hotel for young couples or group of friends.

The room was good, the bathtub water was yellowing and there was no hot water coming out from the sink.

This place is not perfect, so I give only 4/5 stars, but still I had a great experience.

My room was the grand deluxe one, second floor. | Each time I try to log in using the app, it won't accept my password. Then my account is frozen until I change to a new password. I get a confirmation that my new password has been created, but the app won't accept it. I can sign in via my browser (Chrome), but not the app. I've done this multiple times - extremely frustrating! | Me explico muy bien | üëçlove my booking via Booking. Highly user friendly. Thanks | Their app wont let me login. Keeps locking my account. I then unlock the account with the SAME password and then try to log in just to get my account locked again. | The taxi booking service to and from airports is a very useful add-on feature which saves you the trouble of having to pay drivers in local currency. You can travel truly cashless | Thanks | So easy and helpfully | Good rate‚Äôs | I booked a hotel for one night and the front desk told me that the credit card provided by Booking.com was declined. Called customer service but nobody picked up after trying for 3hrs with my kid waiting and not to mention the 64$ fee added to my phone bill for trying to contact Booking.com. So I ended up paying again for the same room on my own card. | Crappy company. Very ridiculous customer service. Didn‚Äôt cancel the booking that was already canceled. | Bon plan ! | Booking.com is always the best to go! Guaranteed, fast and easy! Always the best priceüëçüèº | Booking.com has been my go-to platform for making reservations for a long time now. I have always been impressed with their exceptional service. Whenever I have encountered any issues with my bookings or reservations, their team has been quick to respond and resolve them effectively, leaving me satisfied with their great service. Overall, I find their app user-friendly and their team highly efficient in handling customer queries and concerns | The expirience was very good! Clean,comfortable,good staff! I would love to stay at this Villa again! Bravo Villa Hapshetsut! If you need my advice just come and stay here! Great location Just minutes from Alley of the Kings,Ramzes 3 and 2 temples! Memnons is next to This Villa too! Great garden and smiling owners! You can order fresh food! Breakfast is included ! Very tasty and fresh! Thank you for your attention guys! | If I could rate your company a ‚Äú0‚Äù, I would. I had a total of 3 reservations made and confirmed through booking.com ahead of my road trip last week. Upon arriving to my first hotel after a 12 hour drive, I came to find out that my booking was not confirmed at the property but it was confirmed through booking.com. The hotel concierge had me call booking.com as they informed me I was the 2nd guest that evening with the same situation -that the hotel did not have our reservations. Booking.com had me cancel and book the room directly with the hotel and I was lucky at 11pm that evening there was 1 room still available. 

The next morning, I called the other 2 hotels I pre-booked for my trip and came to find out that the hotel I booked at the end of my trip did not have my reservation though booking.com confirmed it on their end. 

To have to call the hotels as an additional reassurance of my hotel accommodations during 24 hours of driving over a 3 day span was not only frustrating but faulty on booking.com. Once a confirmation reaches one‚Äôs inbox, we‚Äôre led to believe our accommodations are secured. 

When I spoke to the booking.com representative on Friday after finding out my last hotel stay was not confirmed by the hotel property, I was given so many excuses to push my booking to a different hotel all together. I wasted so much time on my trip just ensure these bookings were confirmed only to end up frustrated, making sure I had a safe place to sleep after a 12 hour road trip (40 hour road trip total). I was told by the booking.com agent that I would be granted a full refund of my last hotel payment for a one night‚Äôs stay but according to another rep, it was not noted on my file. I can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm told a verbal promise of getting a full refund and that this promise would be shared in my account notes only to find out the notes were not left on the account. 

I was then told I would get a refund for the price difference from my initial booking and the place where I actually stayed. Well, I should have stayed at the Ritz-Carlton because I thought I was doing Booking.com a favor and found a less expensive room for that night. So when I asked the representative how much my refunded amount would be, she told me $0. 

I will no longer use your services and I will ensure my friends and family don‚Äôt use your services as well. Your company representatives do not stand by their words of promise and if I had known that booking directly with the hotel
property would have been less of a headache, I would have done so from the beginning.

Booking.com - it‚Äôs a shame your company doesn‚Äôt stand by the promises the representatives give your customers. 

booking.com again to confirm the rest of my hotel reservations for the remainder of my trip, which included 2 separate hotels. I addressed my concern with the representative from booking that I already had a bad experience the first night and I want to ensure my bookings were indeed confirmed. | My wife and I are just getting away for a few days for our 20 year anniversary. Booking.com made it simple and fast to locate a great hotel. Thank you | Booking.com is a great resource ,always get good prices | Not sure why this keeps happening, but every time I book something that reads ‚Äò$48‚Äô it then jumps up to $80, with absolutely no explanation for the dramatic increase whatsoever. It‚Äôs giving DoorDash markup for app convenience fee or something. Idk either way, I prefer to not pay nearly double for the same room. Especially when the website is actually offering the same room for the $48 as advertised, plus an additional $9-$10 for taxes and such. I get the app has a taxes too but how is it this much of a difference??? ü§îüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | When I want to see where the property is on the map, it does me no good if I cannot see the map. 
When I use Booking.com online, I can tap on the map and the property information drops away providing me with full access to the map. 

App developers, Do better. | La aplicaci√≥n no deja usar el usuario dice qu√© hay un error, favor de revisar | Easy way to see what rooms are available and room views. | I love that appüëå | Great

And the moms keep changing their minds about hotels üòÖ. I have had to cancel 3 times and make adjustments. No issues whatsoever. It‚Äôs quick, convenient, and 90 percent of the time, it‚Äôs cheapest. Even when it isn‚Äôt, with how hassle free it‚Äôs been, I‚Äôll spend the extra 10-30 dollars knowing I won‚Äôt have issues. I‚Äôve even had to cancel a flight about a year ago. 100 percent recommended. | I lover hopper, I love tracking the prices of flight | We booked an Oceanfront View room at the coast with a full ocean view (right on the ocean) with a King Size bed and hot tub on the deck. The advertised price was $106 plus taxes. We arrived and were given a room with one Queen Size bed, a view of the sidewalk outside the room NOT ON THE OCEAN. 

The front desk said they‚Äôd had challenges with reservations through Hopper and we needed to rectify it with them. 

We called and the representative said he called them and an ocean view room would cost another $179. I said Hopper advertised this as the price and he needed to rectify it. 

We held while he worked to get us a voucher to cover the balance FOR AN HOUR. Then the phone ‚Äòdisconnected‚Äô. Before we realized we were no longer holding, he called and left a voicemail, saying the phone accidentally disconnected and he would be calling us back within one minute and please pick up. 

HE NEVER CALLED BACK!  We called in and got another rep and worked with him FOR ANOTHER HOUR and he could not rectify it and then asked if he could ‚Äòinvestigate it for a half hour‚Äô and call us back. I said no, we have now been dealing with this for TWO FULL HOURS (what a great start to a vacation!), so I‚Äôd like to speak to his supervisor. 

He put me on hold again and then came back saying he was working with the hotel to get us moved. 

We are now 2 1/2 plus hours into dealing with this and are still in the lobby waiting. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FIRST REP??

Worst service ever!  Had they made a mistake and corrected it, fine. But they kept putting accountability on us to correct it, wanted US to pay more money, though they advertised something they did not deliver and took no accountability. 

Needless to say I will NEVER use this pathetic excuse of a company again!!  DO NOT USE HOPPER! They demonstrated dishonesty, terrible lack of accountability and obfuscated all responsibility. 
We have now wasted almost three hours of what was supposed to be our vacation after traveling almost two hours to get here (and it‚Äôs STILL not rectified). I have never been so dissatisfied with a company. | Easy and wonderful app | Love it | i‚Äôve booked a few times with this app and its never disappointed me! i have taken advantage of their freeze option, their carrot cash reward system, and have spoken with customer service before in a super fast manner. i love that it tracks flights for any dates and destinations i want. and also, the graphics they use are so friggin cute i love the lil bunnies. the app is just super easy and i'm happy to keep using the friendly interface. | Love this app | You can find great deals on this app for everything from flights to hotels | Is the best app to find tickets and hotels at the best price. | Horrible experience 0 recommendedüëé I booked a hotel room on hopper trusting that my reservation would be protected in case something happened but it didn't. When I arrived to check-in, the hotel offices were closed and it was only 6 in the afternoon. I tried to contact the hotel to get help to check in since I did not have an email on how to do it, I called and They never answered. I tried to contact Hopper and they did nothing to help me. I sent them emails and they don't respond, so most likely I have already lost my money and I won't get a refund. | Helps me keep track of high and low fares | Love the app!!! | Bb | Hopper always has a good deal on hotels in the area I‚Äôm in! | Every time I have it look for fares, it comes up with so much better than any of the other sites. Thank you little hopper!! | Legit | I love this site, to search for flights, it's a great tool | This have gotten better less time on hold more conviene changing flights! | App is great easy format and great prices | I really like this app. I can check the dates (even the month) the tickets are the cheapest and plan my vacations accordingly. Pretty helpful! | Have be3n using this app for years with great results | This app is so awesome!!  Great deals on hotels cars etc | Love it the most | Excelente | Siempre que tengo que sacar un a√©reo sea con tiempo o last minute uso Hopper! Best deals always!!!! Hace varios a√±os la uso y es buensima. Durante la pandemia tuve que cambiar varios vuelos y siempre siempre me solucionaron todo. S√∫per recomendable! | Best app ever | I have not purchased a ticket but have used to research. It is very easy and there are options to hold prices! There is transparency on what the price includes. That‚Äôs a big plus. | Good app | This App gives notification alerts which help in my future vacation planning. It gives me price points on multiple airlines. It is a free app which I also appreciate.‚ù§Ô∏è | I love this app. It‚Äôs very easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. The information it provides regarding cheaper days to fly, and its‚Äô wide range of flight classes/levels is impressive. | Just use google flights. Many of the app offerings have a lot of conditions in the fine print. What you might think is an insurance to get your money back is actually getting you a one-time, nonrefundable voucher on the app that only refunds the airplane ticket price (not any of the other app fees). Further, the app may time out mid-booking and end up booking the flight with a delay in email notification. So you better wait hours after an app crashing to make sure you didn‚Äôt accidentally book something unwanted. Also, any voucher or promotion you use really is nonrefundable, despite anything said while booking about full refunds! M-4LXKKY.   Finally, the connection to Turo rentals is a joke and doesn‚Äôt actually work. | Not going to lie I use it about 90% of the time. Book a month at minimum from your trip dates. Love this app. | Not a bad thing to say about Hopper. | The ease and simplicity of the app makes it a 5 star rating | Hopper helps me to get the best priced flights consistently. It is easy and intuitive to use. Thank you! | Thnx | Love this app. Very easy and convenient. | Easy to use and has some prices. | We like it and use it for every trip | Hopper is so good at finding the best deals on flights. I always check Hopper when booking flights! | Great app to compare all diff flight options | I booked a flight and the trip details never showed up on my trips if I didn‚Äôt take a screenshot I would have no proof other than the money came out of my account. It‚Äôs impossible to get any customer service because you need a trip code which is ridiculous in this case because I didn‚Äôt even get an email! I just wanted a confirmation that it was actually booked but all I see if they took my money and now I have to pay for another flight! | Hopper is a great source to track airline prices. I love that it notifies me when it‚Äôs time to buy. | Always find great last minute deals on hotels. | Easy and friendly to use!",4.81368,1101513,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f8/1b/25/f81b2545-7fdc-c0f8-a787-d0068faf4bb0/bb211926-3663-4586-8b06-7dfc8e63a904_01-Intro_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d6/e6/d0/d6e6d0f5-8e14-0526-e360-51b921f0cb16/63090fac-f322-4d41-afe9-cc08a9846f7f_02-Description_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/86/c9/2c/86c92c6b-5233-4a9b-6d1f-668f7b107fe6/88db50a1-be98-4525-9129-25181b0fd189_03-How_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ee/49/78/ee49788f-d638-4c19-3d4c-c6b7fa988431/fab8dc5e-04d4-4348-869f-7332b6443897_04-Dates_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bf/09/7d/bf097d26-5b10-f1f6-fbec-48fe39070763/e060f38c-1bed-4a74-8438-296542c5ddbd_05-Predictions_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5c/08/1c/5c081cff-2abc-a008-7f43-fe9f5e8a41ab/7f8d647f-61c3-4a7e-95d5-ba0f4d90f4ff_06-Notifications_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/d6/d5/58/d6d558b4-4c3c-90d5-5b4e-f27bd5b0ec96/0475de58-08ba-439a-8f04-cda751e8e22d_07-Freeze_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a4/b8/6b/a4b86b5b-3886-0f57-aafb-bc7b365366ab/57397ac3-7a12-4de1-a903-abd17c27d22a_08-Flexible_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

They get you to download it as it's a free app to download but then has a $5 weekly subscription üòí | This is a very convenient and user friendly app. It made planning easy and the suggestions definitely were helpful. It was great that you can share an itinerary with others who are going on the trip, get alerts when someone makes an update, create notes and checklists. I especially like that you can pull in hotel and flight information from email confirmations and then when you select the places you want to go it can get directions right from the app with options of the different map apps you want to use like google maps or Waze. I am using it now for another trip and my entire family has access to see all the details of the trip. Love it! | Since I have found this app, I only use it for my vacation planning. I love the fact that you shows you distance between locations it tell you if you have planned to see somewhere on a day that it‚Äôs close. It is the best travel assistant! | I love this app and recently used  it for the first time on a trip to Rome and Sicily. It was great having my itinerary in one location and I also liked the fact that I could share it with my family so they could track my location at all times. It‚Äôs fairly intuitive to use and, so far, has all the features I think I‚Äôll ever need for both planning and traveling. I‚Äôll definitely use it for all my future travel. | This app has many features we used to spread out between Google Maps, spreadsheets, etc. Now it is all in one place and very user friendly. I love this app. It certainly has room to grow, but is at a very good baseline. | This app makes organizing and traveling so much easier. The interface is so easy to use, comprehensive, and I love every part of it! | Used this app on my latest trip to Japan to plan the trip and during the trip and it was a life saver!! Such an incredible app! | This is a wonderful app! It has almost everything you would need for travel in one app. I would suggest to add the option to make a reservation at the places you add to your itenerary üòä | I like that this app allows me to plan ahead for my vacation by helping me find not only a place to stay but how to get there and things to do at the location. The app keeps me organized as well as within my budget and prepared for when the time comes! | I have only used the free version of the app but I like how easy it is to use and I have all the information needed at the tip of my finger! | This app was perfect for us as we organized our family trip to South Korea. We visited 3 cities during our 14-day stay and I absolutely loved that we had everything organized from lodging to airplane info, to popular tourist attractions, and restaurants in one place that everyone had access to. I rated this app 5 stars because it really saved us time from having to research tons of attractions as it would always suggest options when we were planning our trip. I liked how the map feature allows you to visually see the course mapped out for the daily itinerary. That way we could see if we needed to adjust our plans if something was out of order. It was also easy to rearrange the items on our list. I appreciated how it allowed us to use Kakao maps although I will say we preferred using Naver maps because there was more English translation available. My only suggestion would be to have Naver Maps as an available option to go to when trying to get directions for South Korea trips as it would help an older person like me to travel, but my teens had no issues with copying/pasting addresses from Kakao to Naver and they were able to manage this app with finesse. | Well-conceived travel app for those of us who plan, and even for those who don‚Äôt!  It‚Äôs intuitive to use, and seems to be well connected with primary resources for your choices on what and how to prioritize the places you want to experience.  LOVE that the itinerary provides the amount of time and mode(walking/automobile) of getting around, so you know what‚Äôs involved in getting from place to place.  I feel very prepared for our upcoming long weekend in Charleston, SC. | I planned the whole trip using the web version. Now I'm using the iOS and every single action is causing a tool tip popup i have to dismiss

It also caused the app to crash which i have to launch the app again, causing the tool tips to reappear forcing me to build a budget or whatever

JUST LET ME USE THE APP

I can't stand this | I didn‚Äôt know this existed until a few months before our trip to London, but I was so glad to find it.  I am a bit of a spreadsheet nerd, but once everything was transferred into the app I didn‚Äôt reference my spreadsheet anymore.  I love it!  It kept me organized prior to and during the trip.  I loved how everything was in one location.  Highly recommend! | Super easy to use and share with your group! We love it! | My friend and I live in different cities but are planning a girls getaway to a locale that neither of us have been to before. This app has been the BEST resource we could have dreamed of! It allowed us to collaboratively explore ideas of sites to see, places to go, things to do and the map feature allowed us to plot out of all the options which were close together for creating an itinerary. The ease of having websites and hours for all of these options also helped structure our trip plan. And the expense tracking, while there could be some very minor enhancements, has been great for her to make reservations so I know exactly what I owe her. I have recommended this app to so many people already and I will never plan another trip without it! And honestly the app has been almost as fun to use as we hope the trip itself will be! 10/5 stars! | after update the appÔºåit‚Äôs start to crush everytime I opened app, I can‚Äôt use it anymore. Please fix! | Available features even for the free version are great, but I‚Äôve experienced way too many issues trying to use the app. Constantly freezes or looses connection. | First time using, couldn‚Äôt proceed due to random ‚ÄúSomething went wrong try again later‚Äù errors. Ironically, their sign up and pay prompts work fine, just not the actual functionality of the app. Happened on both iPhone and Mac. Back to OneNote.

Seriously chill on the guided tour. If you need literally 25 constant pop-ups that don‚Äôt let people use the tool until they click-off, you have a UX problem and the guided tour is a poor frustrating pop-up bandaid. | Loved using Wanderlog to navigate 16 days in Australia... Gave me the confidence to be my own travel agent. We had 9 flights 5 Airbnbs and multiple excursions. Loaded them all easily in Wanderlog via forwarded emails and we were in our way! Thank you for a great app! | I don‚Äôt even use all the functionality, but I bought the plan just to support the developers. 
It‚Äôs well designed and highly useful for a trip. It won‚Äôt make a difference to your travel budget, and save you tons of time! 

i‚Äôm in Japan, using it now, and can honestly say it‚Äôs the best travel app I‚Äôve ever asked | I've been using this app for several months, still figuring out the many features. I would like a little more hand-holding for new users - maybe a larger FAQ section or a sample trip. And it's awkward if you have to change your arrival and departure dates - I wound up moving every day's activity forward manually. Love the mapping feature - it shows what's near what, bus routes or walking time, etc! | This is my go to app to plan for trips! Love being able to save different places in lists and then add to daily itinerary. Let‚Äôs me easily see how to get to different places and let me family friends know where we plan to go for the day. | Love this app ‚Äî great UI!! | This is a fantastic app to track all of our travel plans, budget, and mapping between destinations. LOVE that is available off line! | Extremely slow and unresponsive | Just downloaded this today and wish I had found this sooner! Well done devs! I agree with others that the UI is a little bit cluttered and the pop-up tool tips are very annoying, however overall it‚Äôs a GREAT app for those who want to be organized and collaborate with others on a trip! I love seeing all the places we want to check out on the map so we can make efficient plans for each day of our trip. I did take one star away from my rating because this app eats up an INSANE amount of battery, even on WiFi. I also found that the response time of the app started to really slow as I added more places to my lists. I would have to click things 2-3 times before the behavior registered. Not sure why that would be and I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just a temporary glitch. If that does not improve I will likely remove the app. :( | I used the app for my trip to Spain and it was exactly what I wanted/needed!! Super user friendly. All I had to do to upload hotel/train/airline information was email my ticket confirmations. I was able to map out my whole trip itinerary and have everything I need for my trip all in one place. I‚Äôve been telling all my planner friends about it. | I love the way I can put all thing in one place for a trip‚Ä¶places to stay, eat, stores, museums, everything! | They put everything I‚Äôd want in a travel planner and made it better and more efficient. And most importantly, USABLE! | It has all the things I require for my travel. From syncing my reservations to putting them on map. Suggesting things to do in neat format to having a to pack list that I can customize. 

Truly amazing app. | I have used this app for every trip we make - super super helpful. | I‚Äôve been cobbling together travel planning solutions for years, with varying degrees of success and always a bunch of clunkiness and frustration. But Wanderlog not only has everything one needs to plan, it‚Äôs very well packaged, looks good, is fun to use, and is rock solid! Plus the cost of a pro account was very reasonable given the work and consideration the team has put into the app; upgrading was a no-brainer for me. Thanks! | I‚Äôve tried a lot of trip planner apps on desktop and iPhone and none have come close to the functionality and simplicity of this app. | You can create the itinerary and track expenses at the same time! | Free version provide enough information and nicely saves travel ideas in one place. I use it also for local eatery and sightseeing.  Love map feature | This app is truly life changing. I wish I would have known about it when it first came out. 

It lets me plan my entire vacation so easily. From spending days on planning down to just a couple house. It has every single thing I need out want when it comes to travel planning. Thank you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | I hate that bait and switch. Don‚Äôt ask for my email for a free app and then try to charge me. Garbage. | While there are many options and resources on this app it isn't intuitive for suggesting places and then suggesting which day they should be scheduled when on a multi day trip. Tips kept popping up while trying to explore. I really got tired of being asked, ""do you want to book a hote?"" I really didn't want to book one until I understood where and when I would be going. The AI feature was nice but there again only some what helpful if you didn't want one of the options. I kept having to return to the beginning to get back to the suggested itinerary. I really am better off just using a map app to plan a route and google each location for info. When planning a trip you don't always have the time to take a class/hrs if you tube, to learn to navigate this app. | I was using an excel spreadsheet and manually looking up the distance between places to plan our trip to Iceland which involves a lot of stops around the ring road. WOW has this made life easier since discovering it. I am a big fan and can‚Äôt stop telling people how easy it is to use and how happy I am about it! | I love Wanderlog!! This app is so useful for planning trips. I am amazed at the depth of features. I love the ability to track expenses, super useful to stay on budget and also to share expenses when traveling with others. The ability to send emails with my flight and lodging info, the AI chatbot, recommendations of things in the area, ability to add to the itinerary and rearrange is all incredible. A delightful user experience üòç This is my new favorite app! | I‚Äôm loving the functionality of this app and how seamlessly it interacts with other maps and email. Update: I had an issue with printing an itinerary, but Wanderlog replied and issue now solved. Thumbs up for customer care! | The app itself is alright, but it doesn‚Äôt let you listen to music or audio in the background, which the app itself has no noise. Might seem small but I find it annoying to the point I use a different app, hopefully they fix soon. | My girlfriend and I used this app to plan our Europe trip and for referencing information/tickets/etc. throughout the trip and it was super helpful! We got the premium version for the trip. | Peter was quick to respond to a request for help navigating the email portion of the site so we could plan our triptogether. Thank you. | It helped us not only plan our trip but also keep track of all the details of vacation.   I was able to set up an itinerary that helped keep all of our plans on track without missing anything.  It was easy to move plans around to different times and days depending on our mood and timing. | I love this app because it‚Äôs such a great way to plan a trip, you‚Äôre able to place all the things you want to do on a list in whatever sections you‚Äôd like, create an itinerary, collaborate with your friends to make sure you‚Äôre all getting in on the plans, and even see all the places you want to go in perspective on a map!!! It takes away the need to do your own research on where things are located by each other and saves you so much time. Love this app so much and won‚Äôt plan a trip without it!!! | It makes planning for trips so much easier, especially with the map feature. I love that I can use the map to avoid spending more time running around than actually doing things. I may use other websites and apps to get ideas for things to do but this is the one that helps finalize my daily itineraries. Highly recommend it! | Searched for ‚Äúvacation planner‚Äù in the App Store and found this absolute GEM. I suffer from a lot of analysis paralysis and get overwhelmed when there are lots of options, especially if I don‚Äôt even know where to start/how to organize. Planning a vacation seems like a burden to me (the exact opposite of what a vacation should be!). I have yet to start planning my own vacations, but vividly remember my mom with printouts of directions, maps, and handwritten novels of advice and travel tips, attractions, restaurants, etc when planning our excursions. This app will definitely help me overcome my fears and help me plan the incredible vacations my mom used to plan!! | I have enjoyed using the app for a group trip. Features I appreciate:
1) a place to put hotel information where everyone can see so that they aren‚Äôt asking you questions about the stay you booked
2) a budget sharing feature. Everyone can see the cost of an activity. 
3) A place to put things you would like to see AND a daily itinerary. I like that I can put everything I‚Äôd like to see and I can put must see activities on the daily itinerary.
4) adding notes! Wow this is so helpful. Many things are closed on Mondays at our destination. I would have put things on our itinerary that wouldn‚Äôt have been available.
Also others can add to the notes too. Keeping everyone communicating well.
5) I like that I can just add others to my list via their email!",4.90745,14771,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/cd/9c/52/cd9c528e-a703-0b0a-4cba-f5e516562435/7c11f2f0-0b41-4921-ad99-c58ff1368813_iPhone_5.5_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/2f/6d/dc/2f6ddc71-7c0d-7d10-e74a-4b76bf06ff65/3926c542-004f-46c1-bd4b-541c5650f12b_iPhone_5.5_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/25/39/30/253930c3-1a7b-6933-fdbc-387196b5e9b1/86825c86-6085-4e5d-ab01-402f97df41b7_iPhone_5.5_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/f0/6c/cd/f06ccd67-6605-6dde-137a-32c622dcf2a2/c549a73f-721d-4b3e-9a67-77e344a91a9b_iPhone_5.5_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6f/79/47/6f794777-0bad-ff83-8b1a-42c89c0793d5/e6e09e56-ac47-4f66-8e7c-61196925caa4_iPhone_5.5_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/19/0b/35/190b35ae-c856-06f9-8c1f-503a9e020287/e8fd5f56-38da-43f5-b543-bd0a7a27308f_iPhone_5.5_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7c/97/91/7c979172-add0-b56b-7c1e-5a1bd03c7cee/785f2313-ef55-48d9-a549-9d46e129598a_iPhone_5.5_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/20/12/0d/20120d72-cc87-1e00-6729-d1b9fbc0caa4/8124413c-3bd2-4022-877a-7d5c7d9983aa_iPhone_5.5_10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/72/48/11/72481124-0597-3364-3593-8276b79937ec/d34ee418-5bed-40e8-b629-333ccbb5e06a_iPhone_5.5_11.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/da/bd/3d/dabd3d3d-5f17-0355-4363-d61bc2d2c739/619c8f56-3919-4820-b0a0-ba8f06b4147a_iPhone_5.5_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ad/34/74/ad3474bf-e4a2-516a-21bd-ecf4b8f47628/414f37c6-80f8-4056-9921-8441e60d6a55_iPad_alt_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/73/40/80/73408081-b2d0-4862-193e-0672e62dd8a0/35e12460-c10a-4126-bbdc-1122ac9fdc12_iPad_alt_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/61/97/63/619763eb-c2f6-e083-8a02-7e91d731dc17/36e9287f-56d7-4276-b052-ecb41a18915f_iPad_7.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/2f/52/ca/2f52ca6b-d8fd-2830-5e42-ef0385730dcf/bf65d65b-b080-42de-836c-bf11a60ac005_iPad_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/60/64/b2/6064b2d9-bb6c-7934-160e-cedf1286f107/8fa9155a-8926-459e-9e08-46866a954ce7_iPad_4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9d/1e/de/9d1ede80-cedc-1315-9fb1-c49f03baece5/2c291994-4048-415b-a0af-d96b373160ef_iPad_11.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ce/2d/41/ce2d41c6-8785-29e6-7eed-7437e352b874/7be8f4bc-f6a1-4405-b55e-11506f4d84b7_iPad_6.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/29/b6/d2/29b6d27b-e10b-da75-040b-3d56c6754e54/c03329cb-5a4d-4a85-a8c8-7e77b26cd2e4_iPad_5.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThird

You can‚Äôt search nearby restaurants or literally anything you want to do. Worst user interface. Just use google maps when you‚Äôre traveling. | We had a fantastic trip! Edward is a fantastic tour guide !!! We could not have had a better experience. We did three night, four night trek: the classic Inka trail. He was encouraging and helpful. His knowledge of the culture is impressive. We look forward to another trip with Edward and Valencia travel. | Our tour guide Marco did a great job! He shared the history of each town as we entered it which we really enjoyed. He asked us what we wanted to see and made it happen. His recommendations for stores and restaurants were outstanding! We really enjoyed our tour with him and highly recommend him! | Most important, not even food üòä, but personal attention and very warm , friendly welcome from owners of this wonderful restaurant. We travel with my wife from Brooklyn, NY. And were amazed with simple Naked olive salad !!!! Short ribs were melted in mouth. üëçüëçüëçüëç. Tank you for little treasure in Kennett Square. | We stopped by for Sicilian pizza which was quite good, but even better was their blood orange salad . They also have good Belgian beer. Clean and airy. Service very good. | 5 stars all around! Running and Sightseeing- what more can you ask for - to start the day! Hamidou is a wonderful tour guide. The water and snacks were a nice treat too. | Richard was wonderful with our lesson, a family of four with three generations, ranging in age from 74 to 10. We had just flown in and were running late and Richard still waited over an hour and a half for us. We learned the traditional strokes, posture and characters. He was great at tailoring the class to our family‚Äôs needs. Lots of fun! | Sterling High School hosted the largest event our community has ever had. Candelight Inn was there every step of the way and rolling with the demands of this event with professionalism, hospitality, and ease! Tom the manager made it such a smooth experience and was there to deliver with amazing service! Would highly recommend Tom and his crew for all your catering events! Thank you again Tom and the Candelight Crew, you guys were superb! | I had so much fun on this hike. I went solo and felt safe. I would highly recommend. | Spent a lot of time on the bus to each of the cities.  Tour guide was very informative but talked too fast. Enjoyed seeing the two cities but would have enjoyed more free time. | Great reference points for best of the best in the cities and what to avoid. | Best steak that i have eat | What an incredible opportunity to see North Korea, and so many other things. Kelly made this special and we appreciate it. | It was very impressive that people still lives and have businesses along the river. 
Too bad it rained because we didnt go inside the largest Buddha and didn‚Äôt try again after it stopped raining. Instead we stopped at some small businesses and hang out until our boat came back to pick us up. At least we got to see and fed the fishes that were in the river.
Because the boat was too noisy, our guide didn‚Äôt say much about what we were looking at or past by. It was not worth the ride. | AI itinerary won‚Äôt load | Zen | Wing Wednesday is Sooo Good and our server Emily K was Awesome!!! Such a Excellent Server!!! | We took the Camel ride tour which also included a delicious buffet lunch (outstanding chicken mole made daily from scratch), tequila tasting (not my thing, but interesting), and a little botanical garden tour. You board the camel from a loading dock so it is pretty easy since you are already at the camel‚Äôs back height. The time on the camel was just right, first going south and then going north along the beach. They don‚Äôt let you take your own photos because they want you to hold on with both hands‚Ä¶and sell you high quality photos afterward taken by their photographer and drone. Pablo was our guide and did an outstanding job in both English and Spanish for our group. Funny, knowledgeable, friendly, pleasant. Transportation to and from our resort was included. We enjoyed this a lot! | We took the VIP Day Dessert Tour with Dinner and Entertainment.  This was a fabulous tour.  But what made it Fabulous was Mujeeb Saidu the Managing Director.  He went above and beyond the whole day.  

Here are some examples:

1.  Utilized WhatsApp to share details and costs of the VIP tour
2.  Used WhatsApp to share pick up times,
His ETA the day of pickup, and was the ultimate gentleman during the entire tour.
3.  He gave recommendations and advise on what to select for the tour.
4.  Was patient while we stopped and took pictures and he also took pictures to share.

It was a great day and Mujeeb was EXCELLENT!  Would highly recommend this tour. | I just recommend this nice bakery store on Attila street in Budapest
Home made fresh bakery‚Äôs sandwiches staff are very kind and  helpful price is very acceptable | Availability calendar  and other information is wrong.  Booked tours 3 times for this vacation using the app.  All three quickly charged my credit card and confirmed. Then all 3 cancelled with short notice (night before tour).   We did not get a single tour.  We haven‚Äôt received any refund.   Information on the app said ther tour would include English, but one reason given  for the cancellation was they would not do a bilingual tour and did not have enough English customers. 
On another trip I reserved a tour with hotel pickup using the app and designation the hotel. But then the called 45 minutes  before to say I needed to take a taxi and it due to traffic would take an hour. | Badawy is such a warm, welcoming person. From the time we entered , he ensured  that we were well taken care of . His warmth, pleasant nature is consistent with the level of service that is expected from the CONRAD brand. | We loved the entire fort. The English speaking guide and the cafe and the sights were all wonderful | As a Marriott BONVOY member, I expected the hotel to be like the other ones (regular), however, this hotel exceeded my expectations! I had the pleasure to be helped by Elida upon arrival and she was amazing, knowledgeable and got me all squared away fast! Definitely coming back! | We traveled from the US and landed very early Saturday morning. After our 19 hour flight we wanted a comfortable hotel to just relax‚Ä¶. This was the best place. From the super comfy bed, the gorgeous roof deck pool with jacuzzis, gym that overlooks the city, the most reasonably priced delicious buffet you will ever experience and the friendliest staff- you must stay here! It‚Äôs an absolute dream for the price. You may not be right in the downtown area but we took a tuk tuk ride thru the city center and we were VERY happy with our choice in hotel. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. 5 stars. Do it! | Good review sit but a little complicated. | The amount of design that went into this hotel is amazing, tons of nest tables and unique lounge areas, everything is storybook magical and photo worthy.  It captures the essence of Tulum vibe.  The location is central and perfect, the vibes are great. The staff is helpful and super friendly.  Primo was an amazing guide and very helpful with everything.  The wait staff was always on time and friendly, Julian was awesome and always on his job.

This is perfectly Tul√∫m.  I will be back.  The only drawback to this hotel is that it is in between nightclubs, so the bass is pounding all night until 2am. | Everything is excellent about this hotel , I need people from all over the world, and make so many friends, the service is amazing. Plus Cleaning is super super amazing. 
Mostly a cleaner that‚Äôs called Domenica. She is very amazing. She take care for my  room to look perfect and clean like first day i get inside!! 
I never saw this service in any other hotel! 
I really appreciate you guys! | Every year we come here for my husband‚Äôs birthday dinner. It was excellent as usual. The staff treats you with special care! Miguel and Bertha were very attentive. We were greeted warmly by the owner. Our favorite!! | OMG! We had such a blast at this charming little bar!!!  The music, dance, and camaraderie just kept taunting the joy out of us! Love you all! | It is always great to be able to TripAdvisor for recommendations when we travel. Love the feedback!!! | If you just want to see a bunch of ads for yours then check this app out. No real indormation anymore. Just went on a trip and no vendor cared about TripAdvisor reviews anymore‚Ä¶just Apple and Google maps. | Warren was the ValetMgr who offered us great service a couple of weeks ago. Above and beyond! | You cannot edit your business in the app. It tries to load some terrible web-version but even that is awful. | We had a delightful tour guide. She was very knowledgeable of the area. She shared so much information with us. Her enthusiasm has made me curious to find out more information about the island. There was a small  group of us that day so we had her undivided attention. We felt free to ask questions. A Great time was had by all. Thanks Molly‚Äôs Tours‚Ä¶. | I sent emails but there comes no solution or explanation | We enjoyed the view and the food.   The service was wonderful and very friendly staff. | Lugar excelente, familiar, caf√© da manh√£ maravilhoso. Funcion√°rios educad√≠ssimos, o Sr Bruce √© muito simp√°tico com as pessoas, deixa o ambiente mais alegre üëèüëè | Bohdi Terrace was an amazing dinner experience. We showed up from our flights and retired and sat down and were greeted with smiles and a good attitude from the staff. I would like to particularly mention, our waitress Kanun, who was so helpful and helping us learn about Thai cuisine, and all that we were eating. My brother and I truly enjoyed her company and service. She made our first day in check my memorable. Thank you, Kanun and Bohdi Terrace staff. | Friday night at 8:00 with our party of 12 we were met at the door by Mike the owner. What a charming host he was. We were introduced to Stacey the manager and she led us to a very busy, friendly bar while she put together our table. We had drinks and settled in to peruse their menu. After a bit we placed our orders among the excellent menu items. It was a very nice evening with great food and service. Priced reasonably matching the tasty entres‚Äô. Thank you Mike and crew. We will be back! | Jamaal made our stay at The Westin so special. He helped us find the best places to eat in StLouis. He not only made great drinks , he spent time helping us with directions to a from our hotel and made suggestions on restaurants. We would never have known about the Blues Museum. 
A nice, caring human being, that makes travel a pleasure. 
The other staff here at the Westin are top of the line. 
We | What a blast with Kapalua Zipline! Our guides Ryan and Dylan were phenomenal! Stellar knowledge of the landscape, island‚Ä¶ and of course the zips. They had a great way of ensuring you not only felt welcome and had fun ‚Äî but felt safe! Great assets to the organization. The entire team was top notch. We brought our go pros but their photos were incredible! Don‚Äôt miss it! Would 100% do it again. Family of three! | Our driver, Montiel was excellent. Very friendly and safe. Plus right on time. | We always have a wonderful experience here.  We are especially fond of the waitstaff.  Our hats off to Francisco, Gustavo & Rafael.  My birthday celebration was most festive‚ù§Ô∏è | I'm having an issue that needs to be fixed and I have been trying to get ahold of support but it's been months and they just won't respond which has been so incredibly frustrating. | This used to be a good app but but now its garbage. The filters are completely worthless. If you try to put in a particular hotel so you dont want to see the map flooded with numerous other hotels it doesnt work AT ALL!! It will show all all the other hotels and you wont be able to find the particular hotel your looking for!! 
I travel numerous times a year because I transport Akita dogs for a Rescue I work with and have been doing this for 10 years. I read reviews to help me decide on where I will stay. I wrote a bad review on a motel that didn‚Äôt allow big dogs because it was never indicated in the description of the motel. I wrote a bad review but I was courteous about it and did not use any foul or abusive language but trip advisor didn‚Äôt like it and removed it. How many other numerous times do they remove bad reviews?????? 
It was an ok app in 2014 but now its just horrible | Traveling solo female and TripAdvisor is my go to source! | Great vibe on rooftop.   Beautiful sunset and tightrope performance!   Very attentive wait staff.   All our drink and food selections were thoroughly enjoyed!    Very memorable evening! | Now I can only add one photo at a time to my review.

No matter the location or source of travel needed (hotel, car, or flight). Can‚Äôt encourage others enough to use this. | Fair options, honest pricing, VERY easy to book. Pay later options not all the time but still great! You get  recognized for being a loyal customer & that makes me love this app more & more. | Beware of being ripped off and not receiving a refund even when services or products are never provided.  We added a rental car through Priceline only to find out the rental car company tried to charge us an additional $335 when we went to pick the car up.  We refused to pay the additional money and reported the rental car company to Priceline, but Priceline never refunded our money even though we never received a rental car.  To make matters even worse is that we were stranded at the off site rental company in Miami, Florida because they shuttled us there and almost every person picking up rental cars had the same issue.  We ended up going back to Enterprise Rent A Car and received top notch service. 
VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH PRICELINE!!! | How do I find them ? | Thanks a lot Joeane Valerie for understanding the issue and providing the prompt solution.I really appreciate the great customer service experience. | I truly praise God for Priceline, because during the pandemic, I was able to stay at incredible hotels, and now I still have those same incredible rates. Thank you Priceline you‚Äôre the best!! | It seems to find pretty good prices, but you can enter in only exact flight dates, not a range. | I have had life changing issues that prevent me from going and I have paid a hotel 100‚Äôs to sit empty. | I‚Äôve been getting nonstop emails and pop up texts from this app. The moment I decide to use it to book a WAY overpriced flight that this app CLAIMS is the cheapest-and it is NOT- I get an error message‚Ä¶‚Äùthere‚Äôs a problem in our end, lease try again‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried 6 times and keep getting the same message. I knew I should have stayed with Cheap Tickets. Their app actually works and their prices are cheaper!! Deleting Priceline ASAP! | If you have an issue with something going wrong with a hotel stay Priceline will find any reason even making one up to NOT compensate for the problem. If you don‚Äôt agree with their solution they just threaten to terminate the call and leave you with your problem unresolved. I have never had such a bad experience with discussing an issue and coming up with a resolution!! | I don‚Äôt know where to begin .. First of all the automated service to connect with a live person is absolute garbage .. and when you actually get through it‚Äôs to the wrong department and answered by people whose spoken English is at times so difficult to understand .. Then you‚Äôre transferred from one department to another which eventually returns to the automated system ‚Ä¶ Once I get my issue resolved I will be deleting my account and the app from my phone ‚Ä¶ Booking.com is the better app, this morning I had a booking issue , within 5 minutes my issue was resolved and this was the first time I contacted their Customer Service dept 100% satisfaction .. | cars and hotels are always cheaper on Priceline! I love the choices available. Even on very short notice, like sitting outside a hotel in the parking lot, I go to Priceline to make my reservations. Super easy! And always cheaper! (Flights:  I stay with my own airlines for flight bookings, just to collect the points as part of the loyalty program, and I am usually pretty specific about my scheduling needs.) | First of all‚Ä¶your discounts of 5% or at best 10 % is a joke! I went ahead and checked on a few hotels I was interested in directly, only to find that THEIR PRICES WERE UP TO 25% cheaper than what Priceline was quoting! I was surprised to and disappointed to say the least! What a total scam! I have traveled consistently for the past 13 weeks for work varying from M-F. And cannot believe how much extra I paid for hotels using your site! 
Also realized that I was placed in the worst ‚Äú or not updated‚Äù room in each hotel. So I started to do my research. Unbelievable! I spent thousands of dollars over the last 13 weeks of travel. SHAME ON YOU! | Always checks lower prices, never disappointed! | At first, I was a little skeptical on using this app but now I depend on it wherever I go, I use this app to get a better deal on hotels cars flights so now I use this app more than my bank account would like . | Great app, easy to use and better customer service than most airlines | Very simple and easy to book! Great application. Please add Known Traveller Number to the App. I was able to add it to my flight request when I signed in using the Priceline website. | I recently left a horrible review. Not sure how to delete it but here is an update. I took DAYS of getting the run around but in the end, I didn‚Äôt get my $1500 refunded from Priceline. I am so over enjoyed and relieved. I am sorry Priceline. Thank you for the refund you have no idea how much this means!!! We are not people of many means and had to cancel our honey moon. We were heart broken. Thank you price line!!! | Priceline refused to modify or cancel the car rental reservation and didn‚Äôt disclose that would be the case when booking. They use the bottom tier rental companies and refuse to cancel / modify upon request even though I am a repeat Priceline customer. Please use the car rental companies directly instead of going through this worthless proxy that is only aiming to fool you into some fine print on why changes won‚Äôt be possible | fant√°stico!  extensive business travel. reliable on the spot anywhere i find myself! | We, my husband and I, have booked many stays through Priceline over the years and have not been disappointed yet. Each of the properties are as described on the website and no surprise fees when we arrive. We are quite pleased. | After going on the express deal and after Priceline promising 1 of 2 Hotels which was Holiday Inn and Hometown suite I was given a hotel that was rated 5.3 NEVER AGAIN will I use Priceline this is the second time they didn‚Äôt honor the deal promised | I always find great deals on Priceline, and I really love their book now pay later feature on this app, I don‚Äôt really find this kind of feature on Expedia. I also like how affordable and comparable their hotel prices are. | Very user friendly if you‚Äôre like me and tend to stress when booking this app makes it so much easier for me to book and gives me the sense of security I need | Booked with Priceline over a month ago only to get to the hotel to find out I do not have a reservation. Called Priceline customer support and was told booking go through bookings.com. I would never. Use booking because they had my info stolen few years ago and had to change credit cards and was a big mess. So called booking.com just to be told I was lying about my situation. I will never use a third party booking app again and feel Priceline is misrepresenting and false advertising if they are using third parties to book for them.

Was asked to contact customer support‚Ä¶.well any booking issues goes through the sister company Booking.com. So still no help from Priceline. | I am a VIP Priceline member. I booked 2 rooms for 3 days in Florida. When we arrived, the hotel had 1 room booked for three days and 1 room booked for the next 3 days. We waited for 3 hours before it was solved. I was on the line with an agent the whole time. When it was settled, the agent sent me a link to 20% off my next booking. When I tried to use this code, it would not let me use it! Not a company that stands behind their service! | These hoodlums used Agoda to book my hotel.  Thought I had a double booking and canceled the Agoda reservation.  Turn up at the hotel guess what.. no reservation.  
Really ?  I could have booked with Agoda myself if I wanted to.  I chose Priceline but they chose Agoda.  Next time I guess I‚Äôll just book directly with Agoda | System kept kicking me out when trying to select preferred hotel. Pricing is better than local but does not all a selection for military. | I have been using Priceline for many many years. The more you use it the more you save. I did have a bit of a mess on my vacation a few years ago but I called them and they made it right right away. It wasn‚Äôt their fault, but they still made it correct. I will never use another travel site other than Priceline. | Thank I always find what I need | Two different locations were listed as having multiple rental cars, after placing a reservation at the first- I was called by the location and informed that there were no rentals available and I could be added to a list of 8 people waiting for something to come available.  I called the number listed for the second location and they confirmed the vehicles listed in the PriceLine app- upon arriving they also had no vehicles and 7 people waiting for something to come available- both locations offered to add me to a list of folks waiting when I needed the rental immediately.  By the time I placed a reservation with the third location showing availability- my client refused to reschedule a third time after I‚Äôd already had to reschedule twice and I lost a deal I‚Äôd been working on for three months because of the erroneous information in this app- to add insult to injury, I was charged for services that were never provided.  I‚Äôll never use this app again and recommend everyone else avoid it like the plague. | Always best price ever! Expedia and hotel itself is unmatched with pricing here! | in total 2-3 hours from booking ahead of time, going there, finding out theres no available rooms, calling customer service to relocate, going to that address, finding out its a different address under same motel name, driving to that one, finding out the card info verification invalid, then waiting outside around 11pm for a hour on customer service figuring out the issue until finally priceline called front desk to help verify the problem. made me never book under a third party site ever again most likely. not trying to be rude or negative, just a experience i went through. | As a PRICELINE VIP GOLD MEMBER , I make all my hotel and car rentals with PRICELINE !!  Excellent Service !! GREAT PRICES !! FRIENDLY CUSTOMER SERVICE if you need them in a crunch !!  GO PRICELINE that‚Äôs the only way to TRAVEL

DAVID L 
LAS VEGAS | I had booked 3 tickets from SFO to Nepal (Ktm) with bassinet for my baby. Rene, your agent booked my tickets. She sent me tickets of $2800 and I put my credit card and booked. But she didn‚Äôt send me tickets. Then after 2 hrs I called her and she said that I had to pay $3100 for same tickets same date. She made me scared telling that, that was the last tickets also. I was compelled to book that tickets giving $300 commission. Then after only she sent me tickets. Your agent and Priceline are very careless also I had booked my tickets with bassinet also but they hadn‚Äôt booked bassinet for my baby from ktm ko Korea. How I got problems that only I know. From Korea to San Francisco also I got lot of problems. So I had very bad experience. Oh my god I can‚Äôt imagine how I got problems. | So when your drive 13 hours to find a hotel seems like it would work out fine since you need a bed. Well you arrive 10 minutes after you book your room and find out the place you picked is a dump and they won‚Äôt do nothing for you. So you call Priceline and they simply say well it‚Äôs between you and the hotel. I have been using prices line for tons of trips and this is the last time I will use them.  Room smelled of mold, urine and bleach. Yes just where I want to go. Save your time and stress and stick with name brands and stay away from something that sounds and looks to good especially after a 13 hr drive. By Priceline from someone who has been using u since 2105 | Priceline is a very good app. use it all the time | Amazing | Just arrived in St. Louis after traveling over 20 hours from the Middle East. Arrived at Avis/Budget to pick up my rental. Walked into the lobby and was totally packed. Only 2 agents processing rentals. Come to find out they had no clean cars and they were coming out 1 at a time in slow motion. It took over 2 hours for me to get to the counter. When I got there, they didn‚Äôt have the vehicle I reserved but gave me a full size Chevrolet 4wheel drive truck. I could barely get into it because of how high off the ground it was. This was a horrible experience! I am not used to driving a vehicle this big. I had trouble finding places to park it. Very difficult in some places. Then to top it off, the gas mileage was unbelievable and the cost for fuel was way more than I had budgeted. 
I can assure you, I will not ever do Priceline for a car again if you are going to send me to a place as miserable as this place was. | It say free cancellation but actually you have to pay gor penalty. And the Agent are rude when i called them | Easy to use and gives the best prices! | I‚Äôve been using Priceline for years and recently I use Klarna‚Äôs app to purchase my Priceline‚Äôs trips. They‚Äôve always been very good to me. I haven‚Äôt had a lot of mishaps with them. | It‚Äôs a very nice hotel with a nice and friendly staff. I loved the price of the room and the features inside. 5 stars from me | Roaches in room. | It was too difficult for the app to bundle my flight hotel and car.  Had to book them separately.  Big bummer .  Otherwise prices are great and free cancelations and pay later are useful features. | I made a mistake and booked the room for the wrong day. I reached out to Priceline and they went out and contacted the Hotel and got it canceled. That‚Äôs above and beyond great customer service. | Didn‚Äôt pay the hotel for my reservation ‚ÄºÔ∏è | I have been doing business with Priceline for four years and have never come across this problem before my son is a United States, Marine, stationed and sit in camp Pendleton in California, so I always get the dates when he can come home. I booked it almost 2 months in advanceand his time is to come home and last minute they changed his deployment date so he couldn‚Äôt come home the full amount of time so I explained the situation to them and they said to me I had to pay $360 more to change his flight to back home a few days early I told him I‚Äôd never use Priceline again that they did not respect our military men and women. I am so disgusted I even was told in the beginning it would cost $99. OK I can deal with that but then come back and tell me 360 after we‚Äôre doing the booking is just wrong.

Will never use you again I‚Äôm done | Last April 2023-My flight from Seattle to DFW was cancelled. I was told I would get a credit for that portion of the trip. The original trip was Anchorage to Seattle then Seattle to DFW. I‚Äôm trying to work this out but there‚Äôs no support. | I booked a room through Expedia for $144. When I got to the hotel they told me the rate was $128. Expedia should be matching that price. Yet their scam is you don‚Äôt find out until you check in at 4 but you have to file a claim prior to 12:00 am. Impossible. Clerk said they were aware of Expedia tactics. Bottom line. Call hotel direct and do not use Expedia | Trying to plan a trip for June and it keeps freezing up when I search.   Ive tried updating, deleting, reinstall‚Ä¶ x3, still slow and problematic.  :( | Unless you plan on dying. | I have used Expedia quite a few times. The convenience has usually been great for booking. After this last experience I don‚Äôt think I will use this service anymore. I booked two flights in March of 2020 at the peak of the pandemic. My flight was canceled. I had purchased insurance (which I never do). I tried to call numerous times and could not get through. I was notified of a credit (with a time limit), but no refund. A year and a half later I tried to use my credit through the airline it was with. The credit number would not submit through the airlines website without error. I then had to contact Expedia because they were the 3rd party I purchased through. The agent [Loree EN:0406] attempted to guide me through the process with very limited options. She told me I had to use my credits individually (which is not true) call the airline! She told me the only way to use my credits was to have her book my flight or book it through the app which was not helpful because I was trying to book a trip with my partner who also had credits. My partners credit number worked for whatever reason. They told me I have to contact a third party insurance company to receive a cash refund for my itinerary. So as a heads up, DON‚ÄôT BOTHER PURCHASING INSURANCE THROUGH EXPEDIA, it‚Äôs a scam. We then contacted the airline directly which were very helpful and punctual. I do not recommend Expedia, as they have terrible customer service. Their employee Loree #0406 was rude and not helpful in resolving my issues. | My mom past away and not in my right mind booked a hotel one month out by accident. Then when I tried to cancel when I had the insurance I was denied. | No ay manera de contactar si tienes preguntas ya no tienen personal solo te contesta un chat y es un robot ., no tiene respuestas pensadas solo te ta opciones no la recomiendo porque si tienes preguntas o algun problema simplemente no contestan y cuando te contestan ellos no solucionan nada porque ellos son un tercero y no se hacen responsables y la aerol√≠nea dice ., .,si compraste los boletos en Expidia que ellos te solucionen 
There is no way to contact if you have questions, they no longer have staff, they only answer a chat and it is a robot, it does not have thoughtful answers, it only gives you options. I do not recommend it because if you have questions or a problem they simply do not answer.
and when they answer you they don't solve anything because they are a third party and they are not responsible and the airline says, ., ., if you bought the tickets on Expidia, | My only complaint is I was charged a100 deposit. I didn‚Äôt know anything about that. Y‚Äôall never mentioned thatü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èother than that I am satisfied | I was looking to book a travel resort package and in the middle of looking and searching adjusted travel options for flights and dates the rate hiked up by over $800 for the trip. Other resorts and better all inclusive packages are still going for around the original rate I was quoted. Nothing changed from the original quote to the current hiked rate. Thanks Expedia. You just lost my business with your shady tactics. | Porque el app en mi tel√©fono aparece en idioma chino no entiendo, pienso que me est√°n espiando. | New app slow | Pros: The bed was so nice and soft. The pillows were great..The room seemed to be soundproof because the action on Fremont street didn‚Äôt even bother us when we were in our room. I advise on getting the premium corner. We had a great view of the mountains and the skyline. It was just magnificent. The convenience of the hotels location to live, fun and entertainment was great. 
Cons: My husband didn‚Äôt like the open shower concept. He said, ‚Äú where is the the door and why is there a hole in the one door they have‚Äù‚Ä¶ lol‚Ä¶ water did get on the floor so maybe that isn‚Äôt the best idea. Also he said the tv should have better channels.. I said we are in Vegas, we‚Äôre not here for tv.. but hey, I‚Äôm not going to start anything with my husband‚Ä¶ I love him. All in all we had a wonderful honeymoon. Thank you D for the hospitality. Oh shout out to housekeeping for their openness to providing towels and cleaning so well. | Always use Expedia when I travel    I have been using them for years and keep coming back | ‚Ä¶ | All you need it you can find in this apps | Clean, convenient, great pricing, good safe parking.

PESIMO SERVICIO | These days, with AIs helping us do so much online, one might expect that a classic travel app like Expedia would now be easier than ever to use. But, no. It is more like FaceBook, where the goal is to keep my eyes on the app as long as possible so that their advertisers get a chance to influence me, but Expedia? Is that what‚Äôs doing on? Don‚Äôt they make enough from my booking to pay their bills and have some left over?  Hmmmm‚Ä¶ | Happy to travel meat ppl just Me amd my daughter | One Key feature makes it so easy to use all my favorite travel apps in one!!! | It does not pull up the keyboard to type in location i am wanting hotel stays atü•≤ | Expedia cancelled my booking for no reason 30 min after I booked and now I‚Äôm stuck waiting 7-10 business days for my refund. I‚Äôd be receiving my money back AFTER I would be returning from my trip. Contacting Expedia to get it sorted and find out why it was cancelled got me nowhere. What a joke and rip off!! Please do yourself a favor and read Expedia‚Äôs BBB reviews. It‚Äôs a total scam. Do yourself a favor - delete the app and book directly through the hotel, airline, etc. | The worst place ever I will never go back together the little bit of work no hot water bad service smells bad and they tell you there‚Äôs $100 deposit and only give you 75 back and that‚Äôs not right | P√©sima agencia nunca m√°s la usar√© me siento estafada , realice una reserva el lunes 25 para una estancia del 28 al 29 en el Hotel Holiday Inn Omaha Downtown - Waterpark, an IHG Hotel y en menos de 30 minutos trat√© de cancelarla debido a las condiciones del clima y a√∫n pagando el plan de protecci√≥n con un costo extra que tambi√©n lo venden ahora me dicen que no es posible reembolsar porque la pol√≠tica del hotel no lo permite , me dice atenci√≥n al cliente de exped√≠a que reclame al seguro del viaje y el seguro del viaje dice que tampoco lo cubre. Conclusion me est√°n robando mi dinero sin tan siquiera usar el hotel y habiendo pagado un seguro por ese viaje y tratando de cambiarlo o cancelarlo en menos de 30 minutos de comprado. Es vergonzoso que estafen as√≠ a los clientes | S√∫per lindo y excelente atenci√≥n en la recepci√≥n todo s√∫per lindo gracias! | i dint make my cancelations not good expecia | Staff was super friendly and helpful! Room was great. Will definitely stay here again!  Thank you!! | Expedia straight up lies about book now pay later, then acts annoyed when you ask why you were charged $900. Don‚Äôt trust them just go straight through the hotel. | Walked in and was immediately greeted by smiling staff. They had all my paperwork ready for me to sign. Very friendly and enthusiastic. The property was very clean and the beds were super comfortable. | You guys are so stupid , by your mistake I paid 215 usd so you have to reimburse the money I lost | I‚Äôm stranded at the airport and Expedia has been NO help!

THX üôèüå±üí¶ | I cancelled way in advance for a hotel booking In Indianapolis in March. I still haven‚Äôt received my credit refund. | Terrible for getting in contact with anybody | Have a problem?  Get a call from someone that can‚Äôt help you since they aren‚Äôt the actual company that you have any reservation booked through.  Need to cancel something?  Get an email saying one thing and a chat with another that causes you to lose $800 credit.  It‚Äôs even better when you are told to contact the airline to see if they‚Äôll help and they try for hours only to say that if I booked through them they‚Äôd be able to assist more.  Expedia is garbage. | I had an account I had your ‚Äúkey cash‚Äù and suddenly I go to Expedia and they‚Äôre telling me they don‚Äôt have me,and want me to start over so I‚Äôm gonna go to a different travel app help unless they contact me. | Love this resort. The layout is wonderful it‚Äôs a cashless resort so bring plenty of cash for tipping. That is my biggest complaint you can only get 20.00 out of the ATM. Also two elevators in our building were down that was
Rough. 7 floors up was a long wait for an elevator. Staff is wonderful and friendly. Our room was very clean and updated. Food and drinks were also very good. 
I would highly recommend this resort. | This was one of the most beautiful resorts. The staff was extremely friendly. The natural spring feed pool was amazing. The garden area and landscaped grounds are so spectacular. It is truly a place that you can completely relax. The amount of love that is put into the landscaping is very obvious. | They double booked the place, excepted my money, guaranteed the reservation and then backed out on the contract which left me with numerous problems, deceptive and unprofessional | Don‚Äôt use this services, they booked for you , take your money and if you need help they don‚Äôt answer and you lose all your money , when you try to contact them a foreign answer the phone and is very difficult to fix your problem, save some time and money and don‚Äôt risk it using this provider.
It‚Äôs better if you do your own search and booked straight with the airline/hotel/, than deal with them and lose your money , trust me they don‚Äôt solve your problem, if anything they use the little words on the contract to avoid give you a refund or even reschedule, we lost all spring break vacation because of them including 3000 dls worth of flights, I will never use this app   , and I will not recommend it ever . | No where does it have my booking that was confirmed via email days ago. I need to cancel! You don‚Äôt have a toll free number to speak to a rep?! | I booked a flight, and the payment is pending in my bank account. However there is apparently no information of my booking in the app itself and I never received the necessary email? Now the prices have gone up if I need to book another. Very frustrating. | Te da ideas para disfrutar de tu viaje | 0 stars | If i could give Expedia a zero i would booked a rental car thru Expedia and Hertz had no cars at the time we needed so they cancelled the reservation within 10 minutes.

I would not have booked it if they had disclosed it. Uninstalling app. Would not recommend | I love you | Very good deals. Thanks. | I love kayak! | Kayak used to be really nice, but now they have opened to scammers like Ovago and Gurufare. | Really good at finding cheap flights | The best option and many deals | The search function has been updated in such a way that it automatically brings you to the ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù tab and only shows roundtrips (even if you input One-Way in your search) to a specific airport (i.e. only shows flights to/from MIA even if you enter ‚ÄúMiami Metropolitan Area‚Äù in your search, thereby precluding FLL and PBI from the results). These changes have rendered the app useless for the purposes I use it - to compare one way flights from general metropolitan areas (i.e. NYC to South Florida). | Booked a hotel through the app.  It was the worst travel experience ever!  Showed up with our whole family to find out the hotel was over booked and they cancelled our room!  No warning or anything. Had to repack our car and drive another hour to the next available hotel. It was not in a great area and a sketchy place all together.  Even though we never stayed in the room and had all these issue we can‚Äôt get a refund!!  Terrible experience. | I‚Äôm trying to cancel a hotel reservation. No number, no link to cancel, no cancel button. 
Same thing happened when I tried to cancel a car years ago. Intentional. I‚Äôm deleting the app as soon as I get this hotel canceled. | Great UI/UK easy to navigate to find great airfares! | Blocked as bot searching for vacay destinations | This site always seems to be where I start to find my flights | Great site. I can always sort to
My preferences and feel like I get a great rate. | Please add filters to remove boeing airplanes from flights. | I love this way of buying my flights, it is very helpful to find a cheap flight along with my budget. Thankyou so much. | Very good app for flight ticket booking, I had very good experience with the application | Kayak sent an alert of $616  EWR to CDG R/T but when I click, I get everything BUT NOT the ability to book! | Super convenient, affordable, and easy to plan trips around your budget. | I‚Äôve used this app many, many times to get great deals on flights. The explore feature is rad. Very flexible app that if you dig into can really get you a good deal. No joke. | Do not use Kayak. They automate travel sites that also includes scams and upcharges. Use Travelocity. They qualify their partners from my experience. Was charged over $1,000 in travel insurance that was hidden: had to cancel my cc. | How do you have eDream here???? | Me encanta | Confianza y son unicos | Kayak used to be an excellent aggregator if information and direct connection to companies (hotels, airlines). Now they often simply direct you to third party sketchy companies. Not good at all. | Does not allow me to book a rental car through the app. | This app is full of legal scams so do not even trust its partner sights. Book directly with the airline | Great information & excellent cost savings üëç | Sick and tired of Kayak ads. The more i see them, the more i want to delete the app from my phone. | I love how consistently accurate this app is! | Fantastic price. Always recommend friends and families. Always have better deals | When I want to know the arrival and departures of any flight I used Kayak. It‚Äôs always up to date with flight information | I‚Äôm noticing a glitch I‚Äôve seen for recent years now in that my nearest airport is drastically higher priced than the other airport nearby PSC. I cross reference with Alaska Airlines website our only rural airline and I discover it hundreds of dollars cheaper sometimes. Please correct! | PLEASE üôè THANK YOU üôè | 10/10 definitely recommend !! | This is amazing because I can‚Äôt find these low prices on the actual website for the airline ‚úàÔ∏èüòÉ | What a great site. Gives the whole picture and has many filters allowing to get only and exactly what you‚Äôre looking for!!! Been saving $100‚Äôs and still only flying my fave airlines!!! Thank you, Kayak!!! | Kayak is fine but it shows ads, most from UNVERIFIED travel sites some of which are complete SCAMS - Like PriceTravel.
Be careful - if a deal is too good to be true on a sponsored link, it‚Äôs most likely a scam. | The price rises crazily as the number of clicks increases | üëç | I always rely on Kayak for the best user experience to find the best flight deals. I‚Äôve tried other apps out of curiosity, and in my humble opinion, nothing comes close to Kayak. Extra kudos to the UX team for aligning the valuable functionality closely with the user needs and doing it in a polished and fun to use UI. Keep up the phenomenal work! Thank you for doing what you do üòÄ | I‚Äôm insulted with your commercials. They seem to be geared for stupid people so I‚Äôll let them use it. Good bye | Good app | So easy to find out | I always love KAYAK for all travel hotel, flight, and car rental options great prices on everything Thank you for over 40 years of travel experience with Kayak | Kayak works for me: easy/intuitive app, efficient booking process, all relevant info very accesible. 

10 out if 10 Kayak! | Prices are high | I have always used Kayak and it has been great until the last trip I booked. It sent me to eDreams Prime to book and I had to sign up for a ‚Äúfree‚Äù membership. It wasn‚Äôt until after I booked that eDreams informed me that I would be charged $59 a year if I didn‚Äôt cancel my membership.

For example the United is out from many search that I now they have flights, so I need to use United APP to check the prices. | This is my all time favorite flight finder app. I rely on it and I swear by it.  I‚Äôve been using this app for a very long time, maybe 8 years or more.  It is easy to use, to create alerts and save trips. You can get as many or as little updates as you want.  People are always amazed when I tell them what I paid to fly. I also love the option of fly anywhere so I can just pick a place to go based on the price. | I'm sorry but The text is too small for my eyes. I coud not find a setting to increase the font not dies the app utilize the accesibilty setting for font size in the operating system.  In this case, an iphone. As a result I have to pass on using Sky Scanner. | Prices üëçüèª | I find the app most accurate airfare comparison and it shows most of available airlines options | Flight, hotel, car. Dare you to compare with google travel ! | I have tried them all and have settled on Skyscanner as my app of choice. I ALWAYS find the best prices and the best routes . | App redirects to shoddy airfare sellers instead of actual airlines.  This is disappointing as the Star Alliance website uses Skyscanner‚Äôs interface for actual airline prices in the alliance.  Best to book via airlines directly and check via other means than using this app. | Setting price alerts is one of the main features on this app but when I set a price alert in the mobile app they do not appear in the ‚Äúmy trips‚Äù section to be able to go back and view them. Defeats the whole point of the app as it was one of the main reasons I used it. Still works for the most part to find cheapest flights but no good for monitoring the price fluctuations.

Update: There is no option for ‚Äúhelp support‚Äù in the app. There is a ‚Äúsupport‚Äù button and within that a ‚Äúfind help‚Äù button that takes me to a webpage where I can search the apps website for answers to FAQs | One stop shopping for travel needs! Great price alerts for more savings! | I can‚Äôt see the calendar dates with cost of  fare one way. 
Please help | I love this app. It‚Äôs my goto whenever looking for flights. I always find the best rates on here. I‚Äôm always recommending it to my friends and family. I book all my moms travel on here. I like that it redirects you to the airlines website. | By mistake, I put wrong email, and I don't have any record for the reservation. | I would like this app to give me the option to filter-out flights on certain airplanes. I do not have confidence in Boeing, so it is important to me to be able to easily filter-out Boeing flights. | Love Skyscanner. But filtering out planes is crucial nowadays. Will change to 5 stars once aircraft model filters are implemented. Reason: I truly do NOT want to fly in 737 MAX planes, and I can‚Äôt easily filter them out. | Super app to see all travel options and prices! | Why can't I book tickets on this software? Showing my identity doesn't buy it. Only students can buy it. Why is it so difficult that this software is only sold to students? | All of the marketing emails come to me in Pounds Sterling. I can‚Äôt fix it in the app. I‚Äôve tried. Hence, my confidence in this app is low. | Extremely efficient app. | Hate the recent update that removed domestic US flights. Skyscanner was my used travel app and this almost completely ruins the point for me. It was already lacking in filters and the latest update  just made it even worse and ruined the user experience for me | I like it when it shows the price of each day of the months | only reason i used the app | You used to be able to click the explore everywhere tab & it would show you the cheapest flights from your nearest airport. Now it just shows you countries, 0 flights in America. The entire reason I used this app is now gone | Automatic 1 star and deletion of the app | Great deals on airfare directly to the airlines | Why the mention price has been Chang after submitting | Skyscanner is the best app for my travels. They seem to give you honest prices instead of inflated numbers to get extra money from you. I highly recommend. | Not the first time | Links to fraudulent Indian websites | Easy way to compare prices | I don‚Äôt fly basic economy. I wish the app has an option to filter out basic economy fares. I have to leave the app to find the regular economy fare on the airline site. The app should let me remove basic economy fares from the results. | Love this app! | Helped me find flights in a crunch when other sites could not deliver | It would be a better app if the prices WERE ACTUALLY the real prices. Most of the time they give a low price but once you click on it, it doesn‚Äôt exist. For example: I saw a roundtrip for $81 from New York to Colombia I click it and the price doesn‚Äôt exist.

Specifically, there are certain airlines that I refuse to fly. Of course, whenever I see a great deal, it is usually for one of those airlines (cough, spirit, cough). Any chance there could be an update to the app that would allow for that? A way to save favorite airlines? That way I don‚Äôt get my hopes up when I see a super cheap flight that will just add on the fees AND give terrible service. | Awesome | I have used Skyscanner when I start planning for a trip. Every time I have found Skyscanner very efficient, easy to use, and the price indicator extremely helpful. I will never undertake a trip without using Skyscanner.
Wilson | I went through the entire process of booking a great priced flight only to have it REJECTED!  Wouldn‚Äôt take my three digit CVV code!  Scammers. I‚Äôll never use or recommend your sight again. | Waste of time, price change just before pay. 
Not just a coincidence with this kind of searchers. And do not tell me ‚Äúhigh demand‚Äù | Thanks for such a useful app!
I | Great app. I love how you can search anywhere to find the cheapest flights from your airport | I love it and I like this website | They removed the core functionality that made SkyScanner great several years ago. There was a map and you could search across geographic locations. It‚Äôs now the exact same functionality as every other app, so this is nothing special, outside of a memory of a better, more interesting tool. | When I was attempting to book a room, I got to a screen informing me I could not do so without giving up my mobile number. In doing that I was told I was consenting to receiving automated marketing messages.

Awesome job! | I cannot comment on the Airbnb app itself. However, Airbnb needs to improve its quality control over hosts. In my recent experiences, two hosts asked for cancellations due to lease extensions. When I contacted customer service, I was given the option to cancel without penalties for the host or to ask the host to cancel with penalties. I chose to cancel to avoid penalizing the host. Another time, we arrived at an Airbnb with no hot water, and the host's response was to fix it but also caution us about water usage.Considering the prices charged by Airbnb, which are comparable to or higher than hotels, these issues are concerning. I've decided to minimize my bookings with Airbnb and opt for hotels whenever possible. | The company did not help to return the money., the problem is that the description of the apartment rental did not indicate that this is a company for rent and not an apartment. Deposit without refund. We have lost money and time do not download this application as it protects the rights of only the landlord not the guest | Can‚Äôt stand their service. Try verbo way better | Due to air bnb policy I was robbed $560.00 . On March 18th made a reservation for a week trip for the month of June . Decided to cancel because of extremely low water levels and spending a large amount of money when we wouldnt be able to enjoy the water. Canceled the air bnb today literally a week and 2 days after booking. Since I didn‚Äôt cancel with in 48 hrs i wasn‚Äôt able to get my $ 746 back . Which is crazy because one of the cancellation policy‚Äôs clearly states that if you cancel with in 14 days of reservation they will refund 50% of each night . So after I go back and forth with the host and air bnb they keep blaiming each others policies and I am out a huge amount of money . They were able to give me one of the fees back of a whole $187 so I am out 560 for cancelling months before the reservation. I will not recommend nor use airbnb again , i am so upset I don‚Äôt understand how this seems right . I feel robbed . I could understand possibly loosing the $187 but not the $560 or at least getting half back. So upsetting. | Since I‚Äôm new guest Airbnb blocked my reservation for 24 hrs for which instant hosts are not prepared for and when the request expires the platform lets instant booking guests to move ahead of the line. Seems unfair to me.

Even after I did id verification and added pics.

Thanks
Sanjay | I‚Äôve used this app several times but never again!
I left an honest review of my most recent booking about hiding fees post booking. Also the owner had a no refund policy. I didn‚Äôt speak negatively about the house nor the owner but airbnb decided to remove my review. I spoke highly of the owner and the house unbelievable. | Pretty awful experiences the past couple times I have used airbnb for a trip. One such time where a host cancelled two days before our event, and airbnb gave us credit to travel for a whole two weeks after. Perhaps if they could ask my boss for some quick PTO that would‚Äôve been a reasonable response. Another time we were charged $70 for two brand new towels (a brand of quality much higher than what we were given at the apartment) after our ‚Äúsuperhost‚Äù found very small stains on one towel. No one in our group could remember using such a towel, and after rejecting this request, airbnb sided with their host with no real explanation besides ‚Äúits our policy‚Äù. With very poor support and the immense rise in cleaning fees, I really see no reason to not stay in a hotel. I would probably prefer camping outside seeing as a sidewalk can‚Äôt charge me for damage I didn‚Äôt cause. Sad to see what used to be a good experience go downhill so quickly. | For the astronomical fees they charge you don‚Äôt get any service if you actually have a problem with your rental. Calls go to some cheap sweat shop outsourcer. Oh, and don‚Äôt forget to take out your own trash after you pay the $300 cleaning fee. | Airbnb does not offer customer service or resolution for things that any reasonable and professional hotel would. 

Our room had broken blinds, dozens of ants, and the fuse box couldn‚Äôt handle our electricity use. 

Airbnb refused to address any of these issues while the owner wanted to come spray ant spray while me and my children are staying there and argued with me about the power actually going out saying this has never happened with any other customers. Excuses and the blame game. 

The worst part was the complete lack of professionalism on the part of Airbnb. They allow the owner to determine any resolution which means they are just a middle man taking both parties‚Äô money. 

I wouldn‚Äôt trust them to protect you or your family from any owner or situation that you couldn‚Äôt handle on your own. 

Bye Airbnb. Into the trash pile of deleted apps and companies you go. | I have used many travel companies and all good reviews as a guest. 1st time with AirBnB was a complete nightmare. Less than 18 hours host try to charge for more guests than what I had wanting more money and I refused to pay for more guest than what I had. AirBnB canceled my reservation, lock my account so I could not respond back to AirBNB and did not give a full refund as discussed on the phone with them. Charged me for more than the one night I stayed. AirBnB helped this host extort me of money. I was forced to drive home more than 5 hours away because had no additional funds for other lodging to finish our vacation. Vacation ruined, my husband, kids and I devastated. Will never refer AirBnB to anyone. The communication between host, guest and AirBnB was horrible. | There‚Äôs been a major surge of test listings bulking up the search space, congesting the list with repetitive and often joke-implied fake listings for ‚Äútesting purposes‚Äù ‚Äî Why does one host need multiple test listings of very similar unit tests? (some hosts doing this will just straight up add ‚Äúfunny‚Äù pictures of drawings and immature headlines for the listings. It‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre not using this feature to practice advertising and even more obvious that Airbnb is not vetting these listings at all. It takes up a lot of the featured showings and makes the search very exhausting to sort past. The experience really hindered the app‚Äôs quality and function for me. 

Another thing I found is the hosts‚Äô tendencies to write external fees within the listings, without applying them to the calculated amounts in the system. They have been charging Airbnb guests outside of the app and I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs in violation of the company‚Äôs policies. | The absolute worst company I have ever dealt with! I booked a stay through air bnb and they canceled my reservation with no warning and deactivated my account and will not give me back my money. They are thiefs and have the worst customer service ever!! Your better off with a hotel! | They help scammers by not considering complaints about hidden payments from the landlord. After booking, you find out that the price was for one person, not for four people, and you still need to pay. If you refuse, they do not return the money and do not provide accommodation unless you pay an additional fee. | This app/platform lists many places to stay after you type in the dates, great huh?! Well, here‚Äôs the catch‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt find out that the place is actually available until after you book. Then the hosts tells you they never approved or are unavailable. Yet the app/platform keeps showing their listings as an option. Thus, when booking anything it‚Äôs a 50:50 gamble and even through they will refund you if a host cancels last minute, the hold stays on your card for 10 days. Advice to travelers: Message your host first to confirm before automatically booking anything. This company is deceptive and many listings are fraudulent. | The wife and I booked a stay for my 40th and the superhost just cancelled our reservation with no reason. So now we have to stay further away and spend considerably more money to try and keep our trip on plan. There also doesn‚Äôt seem to be steep enough penalties for their host to do this and their response was weak and without and resolve. I find it hard to use this service when there isn‚Äôt a guarantee and less issues that you get when booking a hotel. | Hice una reservaci√≥n 15 minutos antes de llegar me dicen que el lugar no est√° disponible, contacto con servicio al cliente de la app y me responden hasta el d√≠a siguiente a las 5 am cuando estaba bien dormido en un hotel, pasa la ma√±ana y todav√≠a no me resuelven, no me devuelven mi dinero y no me ofrecen alternativas, me toca resolver con mi dinero y mis habilidades, definitivamente no la recomiendo, y esto es de usar bajo su propio riesgo, pero que p√©simo servicio de La aplicaci√≥n y los due√±os si no est√°n dispuestos a alquilar entonces que no se metan al negocio de alojamiento, pero al parecer esta es una nueva forma de estafa inform√°tica, que mal por Airbnb que no define bien sus reglas!!! | Airbnb is a well know advocate and supporter of the killings of thousands if not millions of Palestinians. The majority of the murders it funds is directed mostly towards children !!! | I have truly had the worst experience with Air bnb. I tried booking 4 hotel rooms with a specific host just for her to decline each request and tell me that the dates weren‚Äôt available, even though the site was showing it was available for when I needed it. This person had over 100 apartment units available to book on the Air bnb site. I asked if any were available and she told me NO. Not to mention my account got restricted because they suspected fraud since I tried booking 4 apartment units back to back. I contacted customer support 3 times about getting my account corrected. My account will be restricted for 10 days. They were no help what so ever. Their only solution was to have one of my guest book the apartment. I tried booking under my mothers Air bnb account just for me to have issues with her account as well. I ended up on the phone with air bnb 3 times on behalf of her account. My experience has been horrible. I have given up. I recommend using another app like Vrbo. This experience was extremely unexpected. And not to mention this was my FIRST TIME BOOKING WITH AIR BNB. I have heard good things about air bnb so this was very unexpected. | This is a review of the Airbnb app only not the service. 

The app is the best version they‚Äôve ever released! I can do pretty much everything for my cell phone. It‚Äôs intuitive and lacks the clutter that every other booking app has her hosts. | I‚Äôve had several good experiences with Airbnb, and when things go smoothly, it can be a great experience.  But when hosts misrepresent their properties, or act out of bad faith, Airbnb does surprisingly little to step in and address the issues.

We recently had a trip where the host listed the size of their home to be 50%+ bigger than it actually was. When we reported it to Airbnb, they said there was little they could do and any refund would have to come willingly from the host (who obviously declined to give any money back).  The host was clearly acting in bad faith and admitted the place was not as large as advertised, and Airbnb continued to let him list it without issue (my hunch is that he makes Airbnb a significant amount of money through his dozens of properties, and they don‚Äôt want to ruffle his feathers).

After a lot back and forth with Airbnb support, they offered to refund $9 on a $5,000. Unbelievable.

The system works when everything is good, but when anything else happens, be prepared for Airbnb to leave you stranded and keep your money. | In an app, like this, it would be basic functionality to allow the users to hide properties which they don‚Äôt like.
Anytime, I have to search for a rental, it‚Äôs like finding a needle in a haystack.
I keep going over the same properties over and over and then just give up and book a hotel. Lol. | Six of us traveled together and booked an airbnb. Three out of six come home with bedbug bites. I provided clear photos to customer support seeking for a solution, but they refuse to step in, claiming unless I have photos of the bedbug, they can‚Äôt do anything. Knowing bedbug bites takes few days to show plus we had a short trip, this seem like Airbnb is protecting the host. We stepped back and said if they can‚Äôt issue any refund, at least temporarily suspend the host to protect other users. Airbnb refuses again. So travelers, don‚Äôt use airbnb ‚Äî your safety is NOT protected!! Go get a hotel room instead | Our family booked a condo in Cambridge Ma March 13-17.  The owner Adam was not allowed to do short term rentals in this building (Airbnb‚Äôs).  I have evidence showing this from the building owner and management.  The apartment was extremely dirty and had a horrible smell.  Airbnb asked for proof.  So I returned to the apartment and took timestamp photos.  The owner(Adam) disputed the claims/photos.  Saying I doctored the photos.  Airbnb refused to provide a refund.  I would NOT use Airbnb. | I have been a loyal airbnb customer for 5 years. I will never use airbnb again. I heard people say they dont like airbnbs because they are never clean . Now I see what everyone means. My last 3 airbnbs have been disgusting and each time it gets worse. The worse part about airbnb  is they take the HOST side before the consumer and we pay all the money. They don‚Äôt compensate you for the dirty and unsafe listing. Airbnb support told me my host was being to kind for refunding me for the days after I cancel my airbnb ! As she should because I wont be there !!!! The blatant disrespect has lost a loyal customer. Airbnb should be ASHAMED ! | I rented an apartment and I got a notice of the host not paying rent. When I contacted air bnb they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything! I paid way more than the actual rent, since I had the bill, and was shocked to know Air Bnb couldn‚Äôt do a thing! I had to handle it with my host, is what they said. Why do I pay a service fee then? How can you allow someone to post a rental if it‚Äôs not paid for on the host side? The customer service has gone downhill dramatically in the last year. So many issues with so many properties and they never help. After 6 years I am done with this app. Hotels at least are more accountable than this platforms and it‚Äôs rentals. | So Awesome | This company is a scam, it has absolutely no customer service. I have several issues with the app itself and for a stay I did using the app. I am chatting on the app and random people come and say they will work on the case but fee mins later they are gone and no updates for several days. Chat bot keeps asking do you still need help but that dumb bot doesn't see that airbnb has done nothing. I have called and talked to actual people but they say they will work but nothing is done by them as well. I previously reported issue to executive team and that person said let me work on it and get back to you but it has been more than a month and no one has responded. Disgusting app experience and with the staff of airbnb | I have used airbnb for years. They decided to remove my account with no further explanation, asked for an appeal and the information they based this decision on. Just denied my appeal and removed my account unfairly. This app was great, has been horrible this past year. | Don‚Äôt download this. For some reason it needed a card put in then it took $22 from my account. Very annoying | after years of dealing with discrimination, terrible customer service, rates above market price, and a platform that puts its hosts above its guests, I just had my last negative experience. Verbo and hotels.com are better in every way. | They don‚Äôt care anymore. 
Customer service will leave you hanging with no way to escalate issue to upper management. 

What are we suppose to do now | I had decent experience with airbnb. My issue comes in with the ‚Äúreview‚Äù system. I don‚Äôt feel it is fair that the app urges us to give the host a good review or it won‚Äôt be posted, but the host can write a bad review about the customer and it gets posted with no issues. Plus we have to ‚Äúdispute‚Äù a negative review through support which takes forever if it even happens. It‚Äôs very dishonest and unfair to current and future users. All reviews about the host should be posted, good or bad because all reviews get posted about the customer no matter if it‚Äôs good or bad. I will not use the app anymore because of this. I deleted my account. | Verification system threw up random error messages on browser when trying to verify phone number.
Then after I try on the app it says I can‚Äôt confirm for 24 hours?!
Talked to customer service representative but they were VERY unhelpful. | I have used Airbnb for 6 years. On 4 different occasions I have booked an Airbnb 5+ months out from my scheduled trip and then had the hosts cancel on me right before. This year, Airbnb allowed the host to cancel on me 2 days before my trip leaving me to panic and scramble to find a new one. I tried numeorus times reaching out for assistance and got nothing in return. I can no longer rely on Airbnb, there is no point in booking one since hosts can cancel whenever. The hosts have too much power and Airbnb does nothing to protect or assist renters. | Just felt bitter about recent encounter with Airbnb. I had an excursion planned in Europe and my flight was cancelled in Amsterdam‚Äôs ‚Äî thanks KLM. I didn‚Äôt make a flight and Airbnb would not try to workout a deal and charged $250+ even though it wasn‚Äôt our fault.
Peace, 
Max | Idk what I would do without airbnb honestly ! Wether it's for traveling , work, vacation, or lifestyle good or bad! It's definitely worth booking through, no resort fees or security deposits ! | 2 of the last 3 times I used AirBnB, the listings seriously misrepresented the property. One claimed to have 3 bathrooms; in actuality the property had only 1 toilet. The other claimed to be oceanfront / beachfront; in actuality it was ~1 or 2 blocks from the beach. (The 3rd one was honest and wonderful). 
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll use AirBnB again. It‚Äôs a risk. Owners seem fine with making stuff up and AirBnB seems not to have any mechanism to ensure accurate listings, they try to get you to ‚Äúwork it‚Äù with the owner. | When things go wrong your on your own.  They will not protect you and you will not get your money back, we call this a scam in business.  
What a joke.  They used to be good but now have no moral compass.  Sad. | I had a host accept my alternate stay and she never refunded my money back. I called Airbnb Support and she didn‚Äôt respond to them. I lost out on $687.09 . The Customer Service is in India so you will not get any help with that either. If the host withheld your refund, the host can negotiate what they want to give back. This is company is not about the customer it‚Äôs about the host. | I don‚Äôt know how people afford to book Airbnbs anymore. The fees are just out of control. Between the cleaning and booking fees, it‚Äôs literally half the price if you stay at a hotel.  Airbnb please reign this in and go back to basics. As far as the app, filtering options are limited‚Ä¶and quite inaccurate. If I search for waterfront, I‚Äôm not interested in your property that‚Äôs a 1 mi drive to the water. üôÑ | At lease at a hotel you can hold someone accountable and/or get a refund if the host doesn‚Äôt hold up their end of the deal. AirBnB does not have any interest in your complaints or concerns. The rental could be completely wrong, full of bugs, mold, and you will be stuck for the duration. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, just research AIRBNB nightmares and you‚Äôll find that this organization is completely corrupt and the hosts are more often than not dishonest in their listings and Airbnb does not verify that listings are as advertised. A scheme all the way to the top. I lost months of funds while traveling due to booking extended stays at a string of listings that fell very short of expectation, including the bugs and mold. It was too late once I realized that no matter what listing I ended up at, none of them were as advertised and the company told me too bad. Video evidence, pictures. Didn‚Äôt matter. They just assumed it was in bad faith. They tell you to settle it on site with the host. They‚Äôll tell you the host has THE ENTIRE DURATION of your stay to resolve the issue. Even if they make no effort to resolve the complaint, it still counts. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE. | Why do you hide addresses? I‚Äôm trying to book a place and I want to look up on a map how close it is to trails. Your built in map doesn‚Äôt show the trails so I need the address to look on a trail map. In the end I didn‚Äôt book through this app. Hiding the address is shady! Hotels don‚Äôt hide their address. I booked a hotel instead! Completely stupid business model! | The idea that Airbnb allows their host to charge crazy high cleaning fees is ridiculous. You should not be allowed to charge a daily cleaning unless you are cleaning daily!!!

Airbnb needs to get rid of the cleaning fees and let the hosts build that price into their rental rates - just like a hotel. | Why is it that I can‚Äôt use the app I have. If I can‚Äôt download new one it seems wrong to force me to upgrade to a new phone. | Air bnb used to be a good option, but now since all air bnb‚Äôs charge $200 plus cleaning fees on top of all the other fees, and built in rules‚Ä¶. Requiring you to clean‚Ä¶. It lost its luster. At least at hotels you don‚Äôt have to clean and you also get free breakfast. | Airbnb used to be so much better - now the customer service is non existent, with any problems you will be speaking to a robot, and my last 3 cases I spent useless hours and nothing was ever resolved! Pull it together Airbnb! No more robots for customer service - give us Real and logical humans! | Limited trust and safety. Multiple scams ongoing related to insufficient host/ fraud checks.

Zooming close enough to clearly see borders is frustrating on very small island countries. | If I purchase Visited Pro version, is it gonna be a monthly or yearly subscription? What additional features will be available? | STAY AWAY!! This app supports consumption of endangered species and exploitation of native cultures.  Travel apps are fun, and there are many many others that don‚Äôt do this. Choose a different one. | Can you please make the country flag size bigger. | I have never wrote a review EVER‚Ä¶ but this may be the WORST app I have ever gotten in my life. Very frustrating to work. I LITERALLY had to type where I lived over 5 times. I could not get passed it no matter what. I just want a simple app that tracks the places I‚Äôve been. Do NOT DOWNLOAD. | Nothing saves when I put it into the app. I emailed them months ago no response. Waste of money and I would like it back | Just keeps asking me what country I live in and what city. When hit next, it asks the same question. It‚Äôs an endless loop. | You have to pay the monthly subscription fee to even add the places you‚Äôve been. | This app is great for travel and aspirational travel planning. Lots of cool features, I ended up paying for the full package. Tech support was fast and helpful when I had an issue. | Love this app! I just wish it had some better options and visuals for sharing maps and progress with friends and on social media. | The best thing about this App is that the owner actually responds to multiple request to add cities!  Easy and fun way to track my visits to 54 countries to date‚Ä¶. Including many non-tourist destinations. | It used to be you zoom in and see the subdivisions of the country. They got rid of that and now you have to click the country, then click a few other things. Nowhere near as seamless. Please bring the old functionality back! | The site keeps asking me to update where I live and won‚Äôt do anything else. | I have fun marking off places I have visited and being able to see my progress.  Also, the developers are great, as I have provided feedback and content and the team updates the app as needed.  Great job! | How is possible that you has to agree to receive thousands of emails that you don‚Äôt want to use the app? Plus has to pay extra for add remove but no email scam chain? Blame on you. | Sorry, if I can‚Äôt even try the app without signing up for an email list, it is a non-starter. I should not be required to sign up for marketing junk mail before I even know if I like the app. If this gets fixed/changed then maybe I could give a better rating. | I have been traveling a lot in recent years & decided I wanted to start logging locations. This was the 2nd app I decided to try, but I couldn‚Äôt even get past the set up because it required me to choose my home city off a list that didn‚Äôt contain my home city. It did not offer any way to manually enter my home city, and no way to bypass that selection. So, needless to say, I deleted the app. | Recommend multiple family profiles so kids are encouraged to discover as much/more as their parents | The app doesn‚Äôt load | This app looks so cool, but when I try to sign up, there is an error that pops up on the screen. I used different emails too. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong!

EDIT: The app is super helpful. The customer support was amazing. Thank you! | Well I‚Äôd like to review this app for its features or literally anything but I can‚Äôt even use it. I try to make an account and it won‚Äôt get off the loading screen. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times. | Loved this app. But won‚Äôt load since the update yesterday! | I had been using this app and enjoyed it, but logged in today to a screen asking me to agree to a privacy policy. There was an additional checkbox asking permission for the app to send me promotional mail. I left it unchecked and submitted and was greeted with ‚ÄúWhoops! You must accept everything or delete your account. The two buttons to proceed were literally ‚Äúok‚Äù and ‚Äúdelete account‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt say ok. How insulting | Buggy. I downloaded this app and after 15 minutes of trying to see the scratched countries, I gave up. All I could see was a yellow dot where I live. I changed the water color and the whole map changed to that color except for the yellow dot. Waste of time. | Got this app to log the places I‚Äôve traveled to and even bought the almost $10 packet which includes no ads, unlocks cities, regions etc., of where you‚Äôve traveled. However, every time I wanted to save a city for example in Mexico, I wanted to log Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Tulum.. it would not save no matter how many times I pressed the BEEN button. Even restarted my phone to make sure the issue was not on my end.

Please fix this! | I liked the app but even after you pay to get rid of the ads they force you to subscribe to advertising email list.  It‚Äôs either subscribe or delete your account, the only options, I deleted my account t.  I got fooled. | Seriously? 8.99 for this? You can not even exporta decent picture of where you have been in the map. | Useless if you‚Äôve only traveled domestically. | I‚Äôve tried multiple times, and even deleted the app, reinstalled it, and still no luck. | Get ready to be spammed. They sell your email and all sorts of weird malicious spam starts reaching out to you | This is a good way to keep track of world travels. It works great. | Just trying to record countries visited not give you all my info. Ugh. | So it good with the countries. I was trying to update cities I been and lived and it would let me add. It only updates countries. It also isn‚Äôt user friendly. I have to re-teach myself how to reset the city I currently live (still not accurate on my app). Also, something I can get over if the city updates work, is it has plenty of Territories as separate counties which love, but it picks and chooses which ones (such as Canadian territories not being separated from the country) and it also doesn‚Äôt acknowledge all disputed territory very well. For example Morocco on it‚Äôs map has territory that isn‚Äôt part of it, it is UN accurate, but if your going UN accurate, then a territories shouldn‚Äôt be separate. So Puerto Rico is part of the United States and not independent. I do prefer that it separates it. But I am annoyed that it picks and chooses for you who owns what land. To be honest I wouldn‚Äôt have even cared about most of this if the upgrades I paid for actually worked. | Have to enter cities and countries twice. For example; entering city as Barcelona in Spain won‚Äôt show Spain as a country visited. You must enter the country as a different entry. Not worth $8 or anything. A waste. | The app itself is fine. But to use it you must accept terms that you accept unlimited spam from them and their partners. There are other apps that don‚Äôt do that. There are plenty of websites that do not for free. | This app REQUIRES you to sign up and forces subscription (says you can op-out at anytime).

You can NOT op-out.  Apple should remove this app as a scam to customers. | I downloaded the app because it also has the list of places, food, capitals, parks, etc.  Unfortunately, the app is missing the option to filter searches. When searching for cities in the US, it shows a list of all the cities in alphabetical order and not by state - it would‚Äôve been convenient to filter the cities by state in addition to having a search. Also, when selecting the destinations visited under the list tab, it does not filter lista by ‚Äúbeen‚Äù or ‚Äúwant to visit‚Äù. | This is a good app and I even paid to remove ads and to unlock all the features. HOWEVER, it needs to give more control to the user. They collect so much of your personal information. It‚Äôs like either use it and let us collect these information, or leave it. Also, I was forced to sign up to their newsletter. It said I can withdraw from their newsletter at anytime but there is no option for that in the map. I paid for the premium features but you know what? Don‚Äôt. None of the premium features were worth it. Let me start off by cities. You can type and choose the cities that you‚Äôve been to and cities that you want to visit. But that is it. You can‚Äôt even see a list of those cities that you want to visit, let alone a map of it. Looks like they made it easy for them to collect our information. Inspiration doesn‚Äôt have anything. It said it would show travel photos. The only photo it shows is the thumbnail when you select from want/been. If you do download this app, please do go to privacy section and read the ‚ÄúWhat personal information do we collect?‚Äù Section. So far, what a waste of money it has been. If it gets improved, I will update my review. | After you setup your account, the app requires you to both (1) accept their privacy policy and (2) agree to receive marketing emails from them. If you do not do both, it offers a ‚ÄúDelete Account‚Äù option. If you choose that, it then tries to charge you $2.99, rather than simply deleting your data. | Absolutely cool, only one issue though; There should be an option for the places you have lived and where you are currently living to be different. | Be prepared to pay $8.99 the ONLY feature you get for free is to select your countries visited. All other content is to be paid for. There are tons of apps out there for free that will give you that. Save your money. | Can I change the email address associated with my account? | I love this app bec it lets me track the places I have been and gives me stats on the travel I have done ! | Love the app except for 1 part. It doesn‚Äôt show the different countries for the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are all separate countries and should be counted as such. | App is trash and waste of time | The app seemed interesting. I downloaded it, installed it launched it. First thing that comes up it  asks for your email. App immediately uninstalled. When will developers learn that people don‚Äôt want to be violated to use their app? | X

. | I used to book every hotel stay through this app. Once they transitioned to the ‚Äúone key ‚Äú thing I simply use it as an aggregate platform to check prices. Otherwise I will never book anything through this app again. Fun fact: My European friends still get the old 10%. | Holiday inn needs to replace the mattress; they‚Äôre soft. | Horrible customer service they tell you to hold down the line they never get back on the line. They don‚Äôt try to help the cosplay at all on the phone the first issues you have they don‚Äôt care about it they just keep telling me they can‚Äôt do anything to help you out they don‚Äôt even try to help you out. | Enjoyed our stay‚Ä¶ staff easily available to answer questions. Room was clean.  Parking is convenient to the casino / hotel lobby.  We expected a coffee pot in the room‚Ä¶. But then again it is a casino. Only complaint is that the pillows were medium to hard.  If you like a soft fluffy pillow, bring your own. | on this app, you can search for things like pet friendly you can search for a hot tub you can search for gym. You cannot search for wheelchair accessible or at least I couldn‚Äôt find it easily and it wasn‚Äôt in the area where you could choose specific things. this is ridiculous almost every other travel app you can search by accessibility. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on at Hotels.com, but y‚Äôall need to hire more diversityand pick it up. This is going to get deleted off my phone. | This property is in need of a make-over.  The bed is not comfortable, the water has issues.  Ours dripped from the shower constantly, my brother‚Äôs room had a leak and they had to be moved.  The washer-dryer are very old and don‚Äôt work well.  Many of the dishes and knives are missing and/or broken.  And it visibly needs to be updated.  However, The property offers very nice things.  The pool, and lazy river are wonderful.  Loved the grill area, etc. | What I really like is the ability to narrow down my hotel choices by location, price, and features.
Unfortunately the newest version doesn‚Äôt help much in finding accessible rooms. | I have been using hotels.com app for years and it has been working great. For last few months, its been unresponsive most of the times and hangs. I have been trying to search for accommodation for my next trip for last 1 week but this app doesnt respond at all.  Have tried everything even removing and re-install but no help. To avoid this, I would moat likely start using different planner if this continues. | Forces you to make an account to view your booking. Also does not let you sort hotels by proximity to your destination. Runs slow when finding your booking. | I did not get any help when I tried to cancel.  Hotels.com told me to contact the property and the property told to contact hotels.com. Now I‚Äôm out money!! I even contacted the hotel property to cancel in the correct amount of time!! | There is a variety of rooms to choose from along with prices. All the rooms are clean not fancy, but they need travelers needs. They keep everything around the hotel clean and the prices are very good. | Just a horrible experience | Very clean and the service was excellent | I have been trying to change my Email to my new one. Cannot do this because it keeps sending code to old Email that does not exist anymore. Try to talk to somebody about this but will not allow me to talk to a real person. | The rewards are no longer worth it and the prices aren‚Äôt competitive. Now I use Agoda, Chase Travel (to maximize gaining rewards with CSR) or booking. | I had a bad experience with a hotel.  I wrote an honest review of the issues.  The review was never published. | The app and the website return errors when trying to update account email address. Customer service on the phone and in the chat can't update email address due to security issues and don't have the ability to report the issue to tech support to fix. I can no longer use hotels.com because I can't update my email address. | This has gone on for a long while the app shows no reservations , no One Key credit when mine is over $200 and honestly is worthless right now | The new rewards system isn‚Äôt great. 
The app is also more buggy and so much more slow after it‚Äôs change over. | I find the best deals and I really appreciate whenever a place I reserve is not acceptable they will help me in finding somewhere better | I‚Äôm not in favor of the new rewards program. The rewards credit we now get is almost nothing and leaves very little incentive for us travelers to use hotels.com
I will be looking at other options which is sad since I‚Äôve been with you for so long and my travels are extensive this year.

Sincerely,
Kobe Owens | You RUINED the rewards program for Hotels.com. This is now the last app I use when booking a hotel | I would like to see under trips tab only my pending bookings  not a mess of saved ones too . Booking .com only shows the ones I have booked !!!! | There was no was to adjust my stay by one night. I contacted the hotel and they said to contact hotel.com. There is not contact information for hotel.com. I travel every week and this is not a good option when booking hotel rooms. | I just wanna be able to search for hotels in the areas that I‚Äôm looking at without being shown, by force,hotels I wouldn‚Äôt even be interested in. Let us search on our own. | Not fair | I am not going to claim that I am an expert how to use the app 100%,and I shouldn‚Äôt have to be one !
I think the app is missing one crucial feature to be coming more useful.
Last night I was parked in front of the hotel and was ready to book it . Was on the last step to make a payment when i asked the another person about to walk in if the address shown on the hotel is the same as the one I am right now .
The answer was , no !
The mobile app first question is to choose the city I am going !
Not a good idea because I should be able to choose it on the map also! 
I usually pick it while I am in transit !
To enter just a city and search the hotel is not enough! It is if I am staying in one place more then one night ! But for those in transit, it‚Äôs a lot of work to figure out if I will be booking not far from the direction I am heading!
Google map offers to find gas stations, coffee shops, hotels in route, adding a stop ! 
This app is missing that option!
To be able to find a hotel on my route near by should be an easy task , but not while I am driving !
Lol | I believe this hotel is in a great location but it sure needs a lot of upgrades. The pillows and comforters are very old. It smells like mold, floor and carpet need replacing. It‚Äôs so bad because it‚Äôs been a place for many years that we have use when visiting family in Brentwood. | Won‚Äôt be using Hotels.com anymore‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ | Very disappointed, was not allowed to reschedule a hotel reservation prior to a surgical procedure. Due to blizzard conditions I couldn‚Äôt make it to Denver so will need to re-schedule hotel and procedure. | When my husband got to his room the bed looked like someone had been laying in it.  Pillows were disarray and covers pulled back sheets wrinkled.  Very disappointing and unacceptable! | Had a bad experience with hotel. | Why can t this be fixed!!! | The last hotel at got changed 10 dollars more for the second night | Can‚Äôt believe they will even allow people to stay at this hotel is beyond me. Walk into the first room and it literally smelled like cat pee and ammonia, I almost threw up upon walking in the room. Went to the front desk and the guy says sorry I‚Äôll give you another room. Walked into room number 2 and found that the comforter on the bed had what to appear sperm stains and blood stains. Walked to the front desk and asked when was the last time these rooms were cleaned his response was today. lol yeah right!!! So I asked them to cancel my reservation they did and held the charges. So never again will I even think of staying at another one of there locations. I don‚Äôt wish this upon anyone. | Clean, inside and out. Hard wood floors nice better than carpet. Area felt safe. Good coffee and hard boiled eggs, yogurt, and other small breakfast items were included. Attentive staff. | Since they changed to one key I lost all of my old points | My OneKey points were not received after my recent booking! | I had always used hotels.com and had been happy with them until I cancelled a reservation  with them a few months back and they charged me a cancellation fee despite the fact that I canceled in the time allowed. I repeatedly asked for a manger to call me and no one ever did. One of the agents was blatantly   Dishonest saying they called the manager of the hotel and couldn‚Äôt reach her .. I have the email where the manager stated she told them to issue my refund because I NEVER should have been charged (late cancellation fees are imposed if you cancel after the time allowed and don‚Äôt stay at the property) I cancelled in enough time and I stayed at the property so there was no reason to ever be charged. It was troubling that I could never speak to a live person despite my numerous requests.. I was able to chat and email with the representative. I would NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH AN ORGANIZATION that would treat their customers this way .  I used them frequently before this incident and never would have imagined being treated this way. | Hair on the pillow cases and pubic hair on the sheets- disgusting.  Had to get sheets & pillow cases brought to room so I could change the dirty sheets.  The room as a whole was not cleaned.  Front desk person didn‚Äôt even try to make it right.  No gesture of any sort.  The hotel had a beautiful courtyard outside our room & the hotel ‚Äúlooked nice‚Äù.  But it was dirty.  I shouldn‚Äôt have to clean pee of toilet seat right when I get in room.  Gross, gross, gross!!! | I would like to know who goes out and rates these hotels, where we just stayed was not a a 8.4 the service was wonderful, but the bed, the box spring was broken or something and sink  was cracked, and the shower something was wrong with the hot and cold, it certainly was not an 8.4, I‚Äôm beginning not to trust hotels.com, I would like to know do you really have a team go and check out these hotels before giving it a rating. | We were in town for a funeral. Made a reservation at the last minute for 2 days because the final plans had not been made. When we got to the hotel the plans were made and we only needed the room for 1 night. I thought it would be no problem to cancel the 2nd day.
They said that I got a special rate and if I canceled it would cost me double for one night then for two. I thought it was a crappy thing to do considering the reason we were there.
The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable and the service was great but we will never stay again in any of your hotels because of this situation. | Everyone was super nice from check in to breakfast to cleaning crew!!! Felt safe, great location, clean and hot breakfast food was good. | The app and site give a clear search of areas and true value for your money. With true reviews, it helps avoid some of the worst ‚Äú cheap‚Äù rentals and find the right place for a good deal! 
J Sellers | The hotel was very beautiful and comfortable the only thing I‚Äôll say about it was the tv wasn‚Äôt in the spot it supposed to had been I feel y‚Äôall needs to replace the tv on the wall across from the bed instead of it being on the side cause it was very difficult for the guest to see the tv or if yall will like for it to stay there at least get a wall unit where it is possible for the tv to pull out and turn around for the guest to see it they do have wall units for the tv to pull out and turn different directions left and right but other than that I loved it I will come back again I had an beautiful weekend stay like I said I‚Äôll give yall ah 4 star cause I really enjoyed myself but if yall fix that issue yall will have ah perfect 5 stars | I have deleted and reinstalled this app three times on 3/23/24 and 3/24/24 and I still can‚Äôt login. The app will launch, but when you click the login button, you are told, ‚Äúsomething went wrong on our end‚Äù. | I chose the hotel because it is very convenient to the main entrance to Disneyland. I was very happy with other aspects of our stay, including the most helpful desk staff and the very nice room. | Customer service 100% 5star
Complete team service 100% 5star 
Breakfast 2star 
Location 3star 
Bed/Room 4star 
Shower floor 1star 
The shower floor cracked and made loud noises while showering. 
Cleanliness 5star | If I could give negative stars I would. They failed to properly advertise exactly where the hotel was, and after being a loyal customer for 20 years would not refund my money.

Love it | There are certainly areas to grow.  But, from my experience this the best and easiest app to use.  I do wish when I send confirmations for events such as concerts, sporting events, tours or excursions it would do a better job in adding to the plan with the appropriate event type. 

My wife and I share the travel planning.  This really helps us keep track of what‚Äôs been purchased and what still needs to be addressed.

 In the future I could imagine this app or a competitor leveraging machine learning and/or AI to do something special.  Probably would get purchased by one of the big players in the space like Expedia or booking.com | Love the one stop shop for tracking all my business travel

One thing. I wish that when I check into to flights it would allow me to add the boarding pass to my apply wallet, but I have to go on the website to do that, rather than TripIt. I mainly fly southwest so it may just be with that airline. | I‚Äôm having trouble importing new trip details from my emails on file. Not sure why this stopped happening. | TripIt is my favorite travel app. I don‚Äôt know how they do what they do, but they always beat the airlines when it comes to providing flight delays, cancellations, and gate change notifications. if you travel a lot, TripIt Pro definitely is worth it. | I‚Äôve planned two trips in a few weeks. I‚Äôve used this app and it has made them so easy. I have coordinated a trip for three people with three different airline itineraries, nightly dinner at six different locations for the week, to and from transportation and events. Talk about an easy effort, everything set up automatically and I was able to email it to the folks involved! Thank you for creating an app that actually does what it says it‚Äôs going to do and works so effectively!! | Simple and easy to coordinate hotel/car/flight information. Simple to look back and find the info as well. | I have had this app for about a year and I love, love, love it. I usually have several trips in the planning stage. This app lets me keep track of everything in one place. I easily see exactly what I have booked from flights, hotels, tours, restaurant reservations, theater performances and just about anything else. It is easy to use and edit any change of plans. I have recommended this app to friends. I am so glad I have this app. | It has been a great help to me in organizing my trips. | Oh my God I just learned about this app today and played with it for 10 minutes and it‚Äôs so helpful to organize my itinerary and saved me a lot of manual work. I‚Äôm totally impressed. | I have almost 4 million seat miles on AA.  I use this for every trip business and personal.  Saves a ton of time and it organizes everything involved in travel.  It‚Äôs awesome. | This travel app is absolutely amazing!
Create a trip and send confirmation emails to input!  Helps you catch errors, make sure you have no gaps, etc. includes all transportations, reservations, lodging etc with all the info you need in it. | Was seriously loving this app to plan a big trip with the family. Lots of planes, trains, hotels to keep track of. Once I realized the max PDF files was 3 with the free version I immediately upgraded to Pro to then only find out that they once again maxed out at 25 uploads. Geez‚Ä¶. It was my main reason for paying! | This is the best app ever I shared it with two friends that are not Internet savvy, and they are very excited to use this for their upcoming European trip.  My friend and I are able to share our updates and I love the expansions on each location that provides more detail that we don‚Äôt have to look up. I do wish they could add some sort of budget where you could see the total of your budget at the top or something but other than that it‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs a great app they can be used with, anything you‚Äôre doing on your trip and I love the chronological order | I‚Äôve been using KAYAK for a while to plan and share trip information, but it isn‚Äôt a perfect tool, so I thought I‚Äôd try TripIt for a while. 

It is easy to add your plans to TripIt, just forward it reservation emails; Kayak does this too. You can also enter or change details manually. Tripit is somewhat better than kayak for this. 

With TripIt, it is easy to share a trip with participants who can update the trip with you (e.g. one person works on transportation, another on lodging, etc). The whole trip collaboration thing is easier with TripIt than KAYAK. 

The subscribed calendar support in KAYAK is much better than TripIt. With KAYAK you can see all your trips, including flights and lodging, on your device calendar. I can easily see how my trips fit into all my other plans. Other people can see my trips on their calendars too. I just share a calendar link with friends and family so they can see where I am and how to reach me on their own device calendars without using the kayak app at all; they like that. 

Tripit also supports subscribed calendars, but doesn‚Äôt include the detailed plans. This is a showstopper for me; it should be straightforward for TripIt to improve their support, but until they do, I‚Äôll stick with KAYAK. | My account has an odd email added to it, and with every click I get an error. It‚Äôs been less then 10 min since downloading it and I want out | I‚Äôve used this app for years and never cease to be impressed by how easy it makes keeping track of travel plans.  Especially because I travel a lot. | This app makes organizing travel simple. I email my confirmations to the app and it organizes my itineraries. I‚Äôve planned complicated itineraries for a few weeks in Europe with tour guides, show tickets, hotels, drivers, trains and planes.  The app keeps it all organized and recommends options near where I‚Äôll be. It‚Äôs really awesome. | I love this app. | I love having all of my trip information in one place. I also appreciate the refund feature for flights if the price goes down. I will upgrade my stars when the app knows when I send a cancellation email that the trip information is to be upgraded accordingly. Also, the connection time is deceiving because it doesn‚Äôt take into account when a flight boards, only when it departs. | Been a subscribed user for as long as I could remember. This app is my trusted and favorite travel companion. Highly Recommended. | How can anyone travel without this app? All you do is email your itinerary with whatever on It (airplane, hotel, rental car, tours...) it automatically separates everything and puts it all order Gives you updates on your flight and when it's time to check in. Also gives you option to locate airport lounges or even alternate flights if your plans change. Fantastic app. | I like much of what Tripit does. My big problem is that it does not capture all of my trips. Which makes it useless some of the time. Perhaps I‚Äôm doing something wrong but not sure how to fix it. | Love the app.  Makes it so easy to keep all the details of a trip organized. 
A suggestion would be to allow me add my wife as a second traveler on a trip. | Have been using TripIt for business and personal travel for years. So convenient. Flights, cruises, car rentals, lodging, and restaurant reservations all in one place for easy one stop access. One tap and I can review all my future travel plans. Sometimes I get flight updates before the airline app notifications. I forward info to others as needed and can still put it all in my calendar. But having it all in one place is great. | I was expecting a lot more beyond pulling reservation information from my emails the app doesn‚Äôt offer much in addition. I expected it would provide directions from one hotel to the next without having to retype the addresses of each. | TripIt pushes status notices and delay information to me so I don‚Äôt have to go to the Airline site | I really want to use this app, but I can‚Äôt even create an account.  It asks for me to put in my Home City, but when I enter it I keep getting an error.  The type goes red and it doesn‚Äôt accept my entry. | I Love Tripit ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

I love how it puts everything of my trip in order and according to the correct time, plus much more. My flights, car rentals, hotels, even extra events which don‚Äôt have email confirmations, e.g. ‚ÄúDinner with Mary at 6pm‚Äù.  Tripit has simplified my life and lowered my stress level. ü§ó

Thank you Tripit. | Really good way to keep details of a trip organized. | Fantastic app keeps all my information in order. Lodging information, tours, rental cars all with phone numbers, prices, confirmation numbers all in one place. The mapping function was invaluable. | This app is great. My only complaint is the max # of attachments. It allows only 20 pics and/or docs attached to any one itinerary in the PRO version. I easily max this out on a trip with more than 8 days. And then I have to use other ways to track down my excursion tickets and reservations, etc. 
Make PRO unlimited please. | I used the free version and decided to upgrade to pro when it went on sale. I use this for my trip from California to Vietnam, this is an amazing app that I would highly recommend to everyone traveling! | All you need is this super user friendly app to put together all you trips and activities. Love how easy it is to use the app and how up to date with airlines they are. I also love their response rate on tech support. Best money spent on any app. | This was one of the top rated trip organizers, but downloading the app, I couldn‚Äôt create a new account. Going to the website, couldn‚Äôt create new account. In both instances, it tried  to match the details I entered to an existing account‚Ä¶ which doesn‚Äôt exist yet!  Then it wanted me to log in using Google, only for the exact same thing to happen. I don‚Äôt have time for this sort of nonsense and I no longer trust this is a safe or secure website or app. | I have been using this for years & don‚Äôt know what I would do without it. It makes traveling so easy with all the information at your fingertips. It‚Äôs so easy to forward itineraries & it imports them perfectly. Best ever! | I‚Äôve been using this app for several years. I have been a general user and a Pro user at different times. I don‚Äôt see much benefit in being a Pro user. Airport maps can be googled, and I‚Äôm not sure what the other ‚ÄúPro‚Äù benefits are, but it‚Äôs not much different from using the app without that.

It is nice to have all my travel stuff in one place, but I used the Notes app to keep track before I had TripIt; TripIt does save a little time, when it works. Unfortunately it‚Äôs ‚Äúimport plans‚Äù feature doesn‚Äôt work a lot of the time, even when you would think it would, like when you make a reservation to park at LAX like thousands of people do every week. (I reported this over a month ago and it still has not been fixed)

Anyway, in my opinion the app is worth using, but the Pro benefits are not worth paying for. | When I traveled to Europe on a two month trip last fall, TripIt kept me organized and sane. I moved around to many locations and my itinerary was constantly changing. I don‚Äôt know how I possibly could have kept all the details straight without TripIt‚Äôs help, For me, it‚Äôs an essential in my toolbox. | Works well, it helps me keep all of trip details in one location. Very effective for my 10 day multi-city vacation and works well with other apps. Easy to send my itinerary to the app. | Love Tripit!!!! | My husband and I travel a ton. I travel a lot for work, and then we travel with our two young children multiple times a year. I used to maintain Google docs and manually update all the details to make sure we had a stress free trip. This replaces all that manual work, and it‚Äôs SO CONVENIENT to see everything in one place, in chronological order. Sometimes it even gives more information than you get from the airline apps. I can‚Äôt tell you the number of times my husband and I talk about how great this app is. It‚Äôs literally every trip. Our last trip my husband said he‚Äôd delete the mail app on his phone before he‚Äôd delete trip it. Just download it. There is nothing better out there. | Love this app. Keeps all my trip info in one place, easy to use as well. | I subscribed to the pro version now and this has been a great help over the years. Let‚Äôs you keep your trip very organized and an unexpected benefit has been able to go back and look up a trip in the past and sometimes has reminded me of things I had forgotten, I‚Äôve never had a ride to customer service yet which is a great thing in and of itself and there seems to be constant improvements. | This is great! | I have been using TripIt as an important part of my travel planning & execution since 2010. The free version offers a lot of value and I held off on paid subscription for a long time but started paying last year and enjoying the benefits inc. Inner Circle feature so I don‚Äôt have to manually share every trip with my family every time. Big supporter of TripIt over the past 14 years. | The continuous log in cycle never ends so what‚Äôs the point of the app if I‚Äôm never able to actually log in to use it? | We‚Äôre full time travelers and use TRIP IT to remind us of upcoming trips, hotel stays, auto rental locations etc. It‚Äôs super friendly, easy to use and allows us to communicate our plans to family keeping them informed of changes. Highly recommend. A PLUS, it keeps track of changes on flight schedules and let‚Äôs us know when we can upgrade seats. | This app is impossible to set up, clunky to try and use, and gets everything wrong.

I paid $140 in baggage fees and only received 2 bags. Scammers . | I liked! | I feel like this is a scam site. Over this last year that I‚Äôve had the app, I‚Äôve attempted to purchase tickets at the cheap price displayed. And every time I have clicked to make payment, the very next window shows an increased price. 

This is not because the prices go up immediately‚Ä¶ because I had my wife then use her computer to go to the site/app and she would still see the lower price, therefore it‚Äôs not increased. It only increases once they know you‚Äôre interested in the flight and click to pay. As an example, a flight that was approximately $200 each. Once we put in our payment info and tried to pay, the total was just under $700‚Ä¶ the flights that I‚Äôve attempted to book all jumped in total price by 300% to 400%. 

Again, this site / app feels like a scam and I‚Äôm concerned with how they get your payment info and only then they give this highly inflated total.

I even typed ‚Äústore‚Äù into the search bar, but it just said ‚Äúno results‚Äù.  Went with another app called TripIt.  Much better. | This app seems abandoned. Last update was a year ago. Most contents in the app just wouldn‚Äôt load. Nearly unusable. | Planning a trip to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown Ky and the Creation Museum in Petersburg Ky.  Neither available. 

So not very helpful for us trying to plan a vacation. Will try again someday. | I used this app in Paris, great. However, when I tried to use it in Portland ME, I could not find Portland Head Light, one of the oldest lighthouses in America, commissioned in 1791 by George Washington. There is no way to add manually. We can only add what‚Äôs already there. Need to update please. | Very short overview.   Limited content. | If you‚Äôre into 70%+ of their posts being TikTok videos that they share, along with nondescript titles or descriptions, cool I guess. But that‚Äôs literally all it is, along with the thumbnails/ previews all being broken. 
Trash. | It won‚Äôt let me change ‚Äúsearching in xx‚Äù if I try to switch the card pulls up from bottom of screen then immediately goes back down. Unable to swap and use a big portion of the app‚Äôs functionality. | It has a really nice interface, easy information at a glance! It‚Äôs really helpful and I can see myself using it in the future. It doesn‚Äôt have Istanbul, which is my upcoming trip, though. Would be nice! Thanks, lots of potential! | It seemed easy at first. I want to have hotels, museums and restaurants in my itinerary. The app couldn‚Äôt locate one restaurant. Also, I set up an itinerary and the app lost all the information so I would have to start over. | Like the idea. Unfortunately it is Very buggy. I can‚Äôt search what I want. And the design is not very intuitive | Don‚Äôt bother, this app is designed to serve ads and collect personal info in exchange for doing basic google searches. | Great idea and app, has great potential if the searches were more up to date | Literally just an app for bookmarking travel spots.  Obvious features that would make it far more useful such as notes, personal ratings, and being able to jointly share itineraries are missing. | I cannot recommend this app. The last update wiped my itinerary! Now I‚Äôm hoping support fixes it before I need to rebuild it all. 

I feel dumb for not taking screenshots of each day. But I liked the flexibility of changing my plans in here. | No se c√≥mo manejar bien el app, para mi falta informaci√≥n de su manejo. | This app has no original content.   It just refers you to other articles and links filled with advertisements.   Stick with apple guides if you‚Äôre looking for crisp, well curated guides | Nothing original about this and they post terrible content all on Instagram. They just use other people‚Äôs work! | This app has a lot of good content, but the amount of notifications this app spams you with is absolutely insane. I heard a lot of good things about this app, so I just downloaded it the other day and I‚Äôve been immediately bombarded with 30+ notifications per day. I just looked to see if there was a way to personalize what kind/how many notifications you get and there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any options for it. It‚Äôs either you get spammed with notifications all day, or you don‚Äôt get any at all. Or you just deselect a bunch of things that you‚Äôre interested in, but that totally defeats the purpose of the app. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever left a negative review on here before, but I expected much better from such a highly regarded app. | best travel Apps EVER!!! | I couldn‚Äôt find anything, and it was much easier to just google locations. The app was much too complicated for my liking. | All this App does is refer you to TicToc or Instagram which I have no interest in adding to my phone. Very little original content. | Almost no useful info for places | Gracias | Kind of pointless. Miss Google Trips. | Too many error messages. Can‚Äôt even make a profile to start. App is updated. Just a lousy app | we can for our next one in Fall? | I love love love this app. I even use it when not traveling just to daydream and plan for the future. Love it! | Love it. Best place to get travel inspiration ideas. | Easy to use for travel plans and has lots of good information! | The perfect pocket guidebook for all of my travel needs! Helps feed my wanderlust, plan my upcoming trips and guides me while I‚Äôm in my destinations traveling! The content seems to be endless and always updating with the most recent things I should know about where I‚Äôm going! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è | Planning a trip to Iceland and it was so helpful.  All the great places to stay and so informative to plan just about everything.    Such a genius idea creating this app.     Thanks Trip Scout | Very helpful | Literally opened the app to use it for the first time and nearly panicked thinking I got my own dates wrong. Calendar isn‚Äôt synced, sept is really October‚Äôs calendar for example. Event locations not updated to show new location addresses‚Ä¶ not really impressed. 

I‚Äôll stick with my old school way of planning. | These are tons of experienced travelers. They don‚Äôt take you to the top rated five star restaurant everyone is talking about... they take you to the hole in the wall, home cooked meal that seats a total of 7 people. And the meal is better than you‚Äôve ever tasted.

Their network of travel experts, and travelers input makes it an extremely useful tool both for the novice traveler and nomads like my wife and I‚Ä¶.on the road again yada,yada,yada | Amazing app. Need an android version for my friends. | I love how tailored everything on Trip Scout is for my travel plans! I have all the best recommendations and tips for a great vacation right in this app! | By far the most diverse yet organized platform out there for anyone planning to travel, or who travels frequently!! A must have app! | Love this app. Easy to use. Great for trip planning and inspiration. | Huge fan of this app and loving the upgrades!  I recommend this app to all of my traveler friends - backpackers, luxury vacation, solo travelers, family travel, etc - because it is so easy to navigate and sort through based on your own specific travel profile and what fits you as you plan your trip.

Also it‚Äôs not clear why it needs access to my entire iPhone calendar to add trips. | Great excellent experience!!!! | I have been a customer with Orbitz for many many years now, pretty much since their inception. Today I had the most horrible experience with them. I was prompted to take advantage of a discount on a car rental with the rest of my package. It directed me and set up my rental at an airport 45 minutes away from where I actually landed. I walked to the car rental As soon as I left the airport, only maybe three hours after I made the reservation. It was not the correct airport. They then told me that I could not cancel the reservation because it was ‚Äúpast the pick up time‚Äù and they also charged me for five days instead of four days of safety protection. I then had to spend over an hour on the phone with them, Just trying to get the reservation canceled that I had made just a few hours before they kept putting me on hold repeatedly, and in the end, could not get me an actual reservation at the correct airport, which led me to having to pay full price for the car and for the car insurance, which is nearly double than what you pay for it at the car rental place rather than through Orbitz. So, not only did they create a situation where I am in a strange city without a car late at night., having to argue with Orbitz after traveling all day. and having to spend a long time on the phone to get it corrected. Even though in the end they were able to cancel the reservation, after wasting an hour of my time, they still were unable to provide me a new reservation at the discounted rate that is supposed to come with my package. So no more Orbitz for me. Not only could this situation have been easily avoided, it should have been easily resolved within 10 minutes on the phone with them. Not multiple holds multiple agents and over an hour of time. Truly truly absurd experience. | Buena app | I booked 2 business class tickets to Oslo and am unable to get a seat. The airline tells me that there may not be one available 
(2TCBUO)
The flight is in December! | I paid through Orbitz for a room at the casino. When I arrived at the casino they didn‚Äôt recognize my confirmation. I had to pay for the room out of my pocket so I called Orbitz immediately when I got up to the room.
Orbitz assured me they would get it right. They said I would receive a email and get a refund. 
Well nothing got fixed so I called Orbitz back and Orbitz then said I had to go through the Casino!! Then the casino said I had to go through Orbitz! 
Orbitz STRAIGHT LIED TO ME! Said I would get refund AND LIED! 
I winded up paying the casino and Orbitz for that night so got completely screwed! 
I will NEVER go through Orbitz again and now I warn all my family and friends!
DONT BOOK THROUGH ORBITZ!! | I have used Orbitz for years and so happy with the price, accommodation, flights. It is my go to site when looking for travel and accommodations | Wonderful customer service | We have been through this for 15 years, ups and downs, screams, threats, resolve, and happy moments. I am still EXCLUSIVELY using this website because it‚Äôs like my family. I am very happy in the end. | So easy and so reasonably priced | We love using your services. Thank you so much. | Online faster | Don‚Äôt call Orbitz customer support number 855-828-3959 it‚Äôs some type of solicitation sales agency to people 50 & older (ridiculous). 
My Recent hotel booking I Reserved none smoking but orbitz got me smoking room and hotel charged extra fee for none smoking rm ??. First time ever to pay extra for smoking or none LOL.
It‚Äôs not how much I paid extra got me angry but how orbitz messed up my reservation & No way of resolving through orbitz !!!
After many years using orbitz, today is my last day‚Ä¶ goodbye orbitz | They show one price but by the time you are ready to buy, the price has increased dramatically.    A bait and switch? | I always come back to it.  Easy, and fast.  Also surprisingly gracious when I once made a hotel reservation that was a mistake, and it offered a refund. | Had better information before I downloaded the app!! | So far, so good | Very clean, great lobby | Very Easy to navigate | I can‚Äôt find my upcoming trips. LOL. | Works fast and well. | It‚Äôs a beautiful resort with great service. Its ‚Äúall-inclusive‚Äù designation wasn‚Äôt what one would expect, as you were limited to certain restaurants, were required to carry papers around for access, and had to report your room number about 100x a day. That was a bit off-putting to us. | I‚Äôve been using Orbitz for a many years long before an app existed. While the app is fantastic, their customer service is outstanding. | Was on the phone with them for a long period of time and kept being out on hold only for them to say they couldn‚Äôt honor my credit‚Äôs. 
Don‚Äôt use as they have bottom of the barrel policies, they do not accommodate you also language barrier with customer service as well | Avoid | The place is clearly rundown and in need of repairs. Door knobs are loose, walls are scuffed up, ceilings are painted with different color paints etc. More unbearable though was how poorly the rooms were cleaned. The bathroom was dirty with hair all over the bathtub and the toilet was also clearly not cleaned near the floor. Gross. | Esta aplicaci√≥n para mi es la m√°s segura y las mejores ofertas | I been using orbitz for long time ,, and i will  keep this .. trusted . ‚≠êÔ∏è | This B&B was exceptional and the Host (John) and his wife were pleasant to talk with. We enjoyed a much needed weekend escape and found this gem in Havre De Grace. We will be back! Comfy beds, cute room and plenty of outside patios with gas fire pits to take the chill off. Made to order breakfast to cap off the weekend stay. | Muy buena p√°gina para comprar ticket a todo el mundo . | I‚Äôve used this app for several years without any issues. I use it primarily to book airline flights, hotel rooms and rental cars. | I used Orbitz for a very long time and they‚Äôve been convenient until having an issue. I was overbilled on sight by a car rental company. After a few support calls an Orbitz agent assured funds would be returned to my card. Weeks later after no refund I was told to go to the car rental company. The run around and lack of support left a bad taste. | Needed to purchase airfare tonight for the SuperBowl so I downloaded the app and proceeded.
It took awhile to go through each phase step by step but was successful.  I‚Äôm liking the app most definitely. Wondering why I didn‚Äôt start using this app a heckuva lot sooner.
But Thank you for providing it!
Go 49ers! | the price shown will be double upon check out.
and theres a note from $1506 when up $3100  because price varies all the time.
fooling people! | Had a very efficient and pleasant representative.
Thank you so much. | Have not received any of my reward points in the last 6 months | Pretty easy to book, decent pricing. God help you if you have an itinerary charge or need a detailed receipt for something like a business expense, insurance coverage, or just want to look at the details of the cost breakdown. Have had a couple of trip delays cause overnight changes, and Orbitz people are the opposite of helpful,m. I had an agent try and rebook me on a different flight, and spent an hour telling them over and over again that they kept rebooking me on the same (massively delayed) trip I was already on, and then couldn‚Äôt cancel a hotel stay hours before the deadline to stay, or reschedule a rental car to a different airport because the airline rebooked my connecting flight to a different nearby airport. | Great app! Use it so much and save so much | About 3 weeks ahead of a trip I made a
Couple of car reservations. Then had to change and hopefully get the charges reversed. Had to call Orbitz and I was treated as a VALUED customer. A great customer relations person, handled everything just as I had hoped. | Been getting monthly emails about my orbit rewards but every time i go to the app to use them, the app is not letting me until they eventually expired.

App shows a message that they‚Äôve extended my rewards but with zero rewards!!! 

Stay away! Better do business with other platforms. | Try to cancel and put in itinerary number they provided and it doesn‚Äôt recognize it. | It takes me two minutes to buy a ticket 
It takes me 1 hour to cancel or change a booking
Recently I booked two cars in 5 minutes 
But to cancel 1 hour on the phone and 7 days  for the money back 
That‚Äôs not right 
Need to change that
I want to book and cancel online both things in 2 minutes !!! | Can‚Äôt stand the virtual help. She kept going in circles. And I still can‚Äôt get to a real person to help me | App not working | I could not correct a mistake on my email address under my profile. After googling to find their hidden customer service number I finally got through to a rep.  They could not correct my email address in my account. I used @gmail instead @aol)  So my only remaining choice is make the trip I booked  and then I can then I delete my account.  
That also deletes the credit I have but since I cannot correct the error it is worthless anyway. | Keeps crashing | More then 2000$ direct losses on booking and don‚Äôt have refunds.
5 hours waiting support and then, nobody fix problems! 
But also lost money ( around 36000$ ) because don‚Äôt be on time on events with clients. 

Nobody even send me email about all 3 stores with their app 

Newer download !!! | Not like the fancy hotels (Atlantis or the Baha Mar next door) but clean. Food is good and the buffet has a few new items each night that is good if you like that food. There are regular items if you don‚Äôt like the new ones. Also three specialty restaurants that are ok. I was expecting more out of them but the main entree in each specialty that I got was very good. There best feature is an excellent beach. About 250 yds of beach frontage equal to the best hotels on the island. If you don‚Äôt need fancy and can accept a dated property I would go. We were there for their New Years Eve party which was well done and fun | I recently took a trip and booked via orbitz. I got no rewards. | Easy to use.

Easy to peruse.

Will keep using it | I travel a few times per year so I am not a huge traveler. But I did not find this app user friendly. Maybe it just didn‚Äôt suit my needs but I‚Äôm not impressed. | It has lists that auto populate based on the length of your stay, weather, etc but I really want to just attach my own things in addition, reservations, activities, restaurants. Maybe I just don‚Äôt understand this app. And it has nothing to explain it | Not $3, but $3 a month. Super annoying setup where you can just start making a list, you have to put in dates, destinations, and type of trip. I‚Äôm looking for a packing list app that lets me input my own lists. Keep it simple. | I‚Äôve been using this app for many years and I‚Äôve been very happy. I only use it once or twice a year and it was free before. I don‚Äôt mind paying to keep the app but now it‚Äôs wanting me to pay $20 a year. I would be happy to pay $20 just to have the app forever but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to pay that every year.I‚Äôm very disappointed because I really liked this app | This app told me to bring a scarf to Disneyland this weekend. It‚Äôs not going to be cold enough. You need to change your app and only tell people to bring a scarf when it‚Äôs below freezing. | Very basic packing list. It is good to include power adapters, health insurance card, but neglects things like an umbrella, hat and jacket and small scissors. Also ‚Ä¶for a long trip it suggested 15 shirts ‚Ä¶which is ridiculous. I take no more than 5 shirts even if going for months. Clothes can be washed. 
I don‚Äôt see any reason to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ok I suppose if you don‚Äôt already have a packing list of your own. There are many better packing lists for free on websites. | The way the ads appear and they way the interact (close ads overlap, etc), the app is unusable. | Used to be great. Now it‚Äôs just ads. How can an app about packing have so many ads? It‚Äôs insane. They also deleted all my old packing lists, so I can‚Äôt even reference those. Time to find another app. | I downloaded it and immediately opening the app my phone was overloaded with ads inside the app. Absolutely do not like this app at all | I recommend this app to everyone. I particularly hate packing because it‚Äôs so stressful, but the customized activity lists make packing a breeze. | Don‚Äôt like being forced to watch an ad to use the app | If dobt get premium sibscriptions doesnt seem like you can do much | Update: After using this for a weekend trip, this may not be the app for me. It is extremely frustrating that every time I open the app, it prompts me for an update. However, the App Store does not have an update.

But then all my lists keep getting put out of alphabetical order. This is annoying to find to check out and try to pack. Then items will be added to a person when creating a trip and it is not on the list that I have so where did it come from?

I will be looking for about her app.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I am searching for a good packing list. While this one is okay, it is frustrating. I have spent all day trying to load it up with our trips and it is just not user friendly. It is constantly putting my lists out of alphabetical order. So for me to sort it manually within each list and trip is just annoying. I also wish that I could easily remove a person from a trip and changing from multi-trip to single when duplicating a trip. | Updating my review because now there‚Äôs offline mode. Great app! | This app makes it so easy to put together a list for packing. As someone who struggles to stay organized, this app helps so much with providing suggested items per planned activity. SO much better than trying to make sure I think of everything on my own. I undoubtedly will either forget something or overpack planning it on my own. | This app is extremely helpful. It customizes your packing lists for the weather at your destination (and can update this). It also customizes it for your planned activities and duration of stay. It is a great way to make sure that you have what you need and don‚Äôt forget anything. it is by far the best list of this sort that I have encountered. The only small improvement I might suggest is for long trips on which you will be washing every few days, it would be helpful if you could specify the number of days between each washing so that the app knew what to recommend for packing. Nevertheless, it does a great job. | I‚Äôve never used another tool, but this one has everything I need ‚Äî pre-built lists, weather forecast and the ability to customize. Love it! | I have used Packr on iPhone and iPad for years. I did not realize there was a Mac app until recently so I downloaded it.

I have tried different packing list apps and packing list methods over the years including a spreadsheet, Notes, a Word document, and other packing list apps. I even tried Macsparky's Reminders packing list idea. I always come back to Packr. Why have I tried other apps if I like Packr? Because I like to try new apps! But I will not stray again. Packr just works for me. I ike that I can make different lists for different needs for different trips and reuse them over and over. 

Thank you for a great app! | I created my trip, selected the categories and when I submitted to continue, it gave me the option to either pay $3/mo or $20/yr for premium or watch an ad. I opted for the ad, because I hadn‚Äôt gotten far enough into the app to know if I like it. The full screen, 10-second ad counted down but then it was done, the ad wouldn‚Äôt close! The little ‚Äúx‚Äù was there in the top right corner but it didn‚Äôt work. I closed and relaunched the app twice, re-created the trip (because it wasn‚Äôt saved), and the same thing happened. I could have written out my entire packing list on paper in the time I wasted trying to make this app work. So disappointed. | This app is great, and it just keeps getting better. It works wonderful for multi city vacations or just quick getaways. One of my favorite features is saving customizable list. This allows me to have specialists for each of my trip needs, from camping in the mountains to water sports at the lake. Plus I can add my personalized photo to the top of the trip. | Used to be able to create a new default list with icons to choose.  Not saving new lists or adding an icon.  I thought you could add more than one trip photo. Can't find information on a huge venue tourist site in a city. | I like the concept of Packr but one major flaw. I want it to automatically sync between my iPad and my iPhone. All my other apps automatically sync (icloud) but it appears this has to be manually synced every time you make a change. Very inefficient. | I wanted to try out the app to see how it worked. No matter what activity I chose it pushed the buy-pro. I deleted the app. If you can‚Äôt give it a test run to see how you like it, I‚Äôll try another app | My devices have separate apps and don‚Äôt load the same trips. It would be nice if they would sync and have the same trips. Is there a profile? Not even seeing a way to log in. | Been a premium user for a while. Really wanted to love it because I travel for work a ton and need customized packing lists. This app has so many bugs and I am tired of items not showing up in lists I create, or reverting back to old lists after being updated. The idea is great but the execution is just not there. | Use basically every trip | Very basic app for the price | After creating your trip, you‚Äôre met with a full screen advertisement that can‚Äôt be closed even after the allotted time. The X button is unresponsive. | I purchased Packr Premium several years ago and absolutely love it. I had a problem when I deleted this app off of my iPad and thought I had lost all my lists, but the developer fixed it within a day. I use this app for all of my trips because I love the weather forecasts which help me know how to pack. I also have saved customized packing list for different activities like backpacking or international travel. I have recommended this app to several travel buddies who were green with envy when they saw all it could do. If you travel, it‚Äôs worth every penny. | I was packing for Coachella and this made my life so much easier because I was dealing with a health problem that made me very uncomfortable and not feel like myself. A month or so in advance, I was brainstorming things I wanted to pack and had come up with a preliminary list. Then as I was packing for the few days before leaving for the trip, I was adding as I went. Finally I finished everything on my list and I didn‚Äôt know what else to bring. I had to sleep and then leave in 6 hours lol. It was great!! I didn‚Äôt forget anything. 

I really like the layout of this app. Sometimes it can get confusing with lists and removing stuff in lists it asks you if you want it removed forever, i just ignore them and it seems to work out fine since i dont really need to pack for trips that frequently. It works well for when you want an app that‚Äôs not your Notes or Reminders app | This app is my CONSTANT GO TO to help me with my business and pleasure travels!
THANK YOU for being such an AWESOME APP!!!!!!!! | I‚Äôve several other packing list apps and have settled on Packr. It just does packing lists and does it really well. I highly recommend it. Also their tech support is awesome. | Can‚Äôt get passed the first add. The X is so far off the edge you can‚Äôt close the add. 
USELESS GARBAGE. | You can‚Äôt get to the packing list.  Watch an ad that allows you to advance but the button to advance to the list page doesn‚Äôt work.  Honestly, it‚Äôs an app that tells you how many pairs of socks you should bring on a 3 day trip, why the ads?  Delete immediately. | it crashes on my macbook. too bad. I had used in the past | I am a very heavy packer. Though I‚Äôm still this way, this app has helped me improve greatly. It‚Äôs very cool how it tells you the number of things to bring like socks, and shirts, gives you the ability to add things and tailors needs to the weather forecast‚Ä¶which it also has. It‚Äôs been 5-Starts since I bought it and has continued to be with updated and new features added | Do not download. Interface commonly crashes and though it is ad centric, the ads are coded in such a way as not to allow access through once viewed. Lists aren‚Äôt generated. | Do not have what I need | It might just be me. I love the app, but I‚Äôm not sure how I see the other family members I added. How do I see the list for my son? | This app thinks of everything. You tell it where you‚Äôre going and for how long and it gives you the most thoughtful packing list ever. It thinks of every single thing you may need for your trip! I highly recommend it!! | The new version makes you pay to even make a list anymore. The old didn‚Äôt. BAD. Try Packing List: Trip Planner instead. | Greatest app of all humanity for packing! | I can‚Äôt print my list.  The option is there, but it closes the app and doesn‚Äôt bring up a list. This doesn‚Äôt help me. If you want to carry your phone while you pack, this may be fine. | App crashed and I lost my $4.99 for the upgrade to premium. | I use this app for every trip I take!   Perfectly organized and easy to use!   The only reason I gave four stars is because the local  attractions are not so local!   A trip to the Bahamas brings me activities to do near Greece! | Premium in app purchase doesn‚Äôt share with family, I bought it and thought my wife could share it with 1 purchase. Not fair and the sharing feature isn‚Äôt explained well. | I love this app for packing lists. I have used TripIt for a couple years for keeping track of travel info. This works well with that to help me prep and pack for those trips. I‚Äôm he suggested lists consider weather and what I will be doing (after I make selections) to make the list very practical. I can also add my own notes and modify the list as I see fit. I also love the ability to share a list. I‚Äôm his has been helpful for my husband and me as we can just check that app and make updates (instead of assuming the other grabbed it or grabbing double.) 

The only addition that would have been helpful for this trip is a section for pets.

I tried reinstalling the app and then resetting the password. Same problem. It says ‚Äúwrong data‚Äù.  Fix the app. For this trip at least I‚Äôll book everything elsewhere. | Travel is time sensitive and they take no responsibility 
Better off finding a local app | Booked a transportation card and never arrived but credit card got charged! | The times of scheduled events change continually. They do not follow their cancellation policies or follow up with their vendors on cancellations. They give you the complete run around. Contact the vendors directly all of them have way better customer service. This app service and middle man is a scam. | This tour was amazing.  It was everything we wanted.  The staff was kind and provided so many bottles of water and fresh fruit for us throughout the day.  Views were lovely.  Timing was great.  A nice day. Sandy from Boat #9 and the whole staff of the boat were amazing!!!  An adventure to remember! | Lovely experience any time of year. Many beautiful features at the park and great photo opportunities. Must do. | A perfect way to introduce Lisbon to me. A bike ride through the city, and along the river to the monastery and cathedral. The waterfront promenade was a great way to have the best of Lisbon shown to you. My guide, Ricardo was easy to talk with and gave you enough time to ask questions and see all you wanted to. It has been my best tour so far. | This app is not to good.  You can‚Äôt enlarge it so it stays skinny on my I pad.  As far as it goes for food. I know there are more than 2 places to eat in pigeon forge to. So this is totally useless for me | Poor capability to enter DOB | I have booked tours in Vienna & Charleston, SC. So easy & helpful! Great photos & explanations on experiences. I will continue to use this!!! | Terrible customer service. They only will deal with you in a chat on their app. My error was using the wrong email address, which seemingly would be an easy thing to fix not with this company! After an hour and a half of time they can‚Äôt find any of my bookings, yet I was charged $839. They can‚Äôt cancel the booking because they don‚Äôt see the bookings, but they can keep my $839! There‚Äôs plenty of other companies to book with out there. I suggest you use them. Even in trying to write this review, it forces you to create a nickname, of which just about everything is already taken. I urge you not to waste your time with this company. | Randy, our guide, introduced us to the history of the Garden District in a way that allowed us to picture how it was in the early times. His knowledge of the area was spot on and he described how different individuals influenced the growth of the area. He and his wife specialize in small group tours which made the tour experience extremely enjoyable. | Payment stopped working while I was on the trip, unreliable | Marvin and Carlos were great duo for this long packed day trip to Antelope canyon and Horseshoe bend tour! Strongly recommend for those wanting to check out Antelope canyon with limited time! | Great experience!! Great tour guide, and wonderful choice from our part ! We skipped all of the lines and went tru everything super fast. Lots of people in March and is not even high season!!  Well worth your money specially if you are trying to see the most you can in a few days. | Pleased with how easy it was to use the app! It was our first time to use the app. We have had a great trip and glad we did our ATV experience. | My guide never showed up at the meeting point in front of the restaurant (outside train station).  Was told to be there at 6:45am for 7am meeting.  I took a $20 taxi to the restaurant and waited until 7:10am to contact the provider- could only reach online chat who was trying to contact the guide.  By 7:40am I was cold and it was raining on me.  I walked to the train station to go on my own.  The company and guide had my contact info and no one ever contacted me.  Waste of my time on vacation and an additional $40 to and from hotel.  Would give 0 stars if it was an option 
DON‚ÄôT WASTE YOUR MONEY | Scheduled four different tours with this company. Tried to pay for two of them and I could not make the payment because my credit cards would not be accepted. It was not my bank, but it was GetYourGuide that was the issue. I contacted customer service. We had such a communication problem because both accents were totally non-understandable to each other. I must‚Äôve repeated myself 10 times and to no avail. They couldn‚Äôt resolve my problem or understand it. I ended up having to cancel two of my tours and rescheduling them with a different vendor. Very frustrating. | Took the class and it was wonderful, however I don‚Äôt recommend bc 2 weeks later and we have never received the recipes from chef Myriam.  Very disappointing! | I can‚Äôt live without this app.  Never failed me.  ‚ô•Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è. I have been using this app long time ago and have been never dissapointed. | The only job, this company has, is to charge you for the tour! I had 12 tours booked for my two weeks vacation. Two days before my trip the schedule payment got fail for the first tour and later for the rest. I tried multiple credit & debit cards, all failed. It means it automatically cancelled all the tours. I contacted customer service at least six times and they confirmed it won‚Äôt get cancel or resolve it in 24 hours,‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a shame that this incompetent company even did not try to fix the issue! I cancelled the rest of them and start booking via TripAdvisor & Viator during my trip,‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt trust them at all. They can destroy your vacation. | I paid for a tour. It was canceled for no reason and they kept my money I will avoid at all costs in the future | I‚Äôm not all about writing reviews but I do gotta give a shout out for all the cool things I got to do through this. Snorkeling, scuba diving, boat tours, kayaking, historical tours. Highly recommend. | What a great value and awesome trip | I‚Äôm giving this site 2 stars because there have been several times in this past week (in Sicily and in Munich) where it would have been very helpful to have a contact.  There‚Äôs a number I called but no one answered.  I like Airbnb experiences because there is a direct contact from the beginning.  I‚Äôd suggest creating a similar feature. | booked an activity for $620. On arrival the activity provider had no room for us even though GYG had ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù our booking. We then received an email advising us that we needed to choose a different date (we had driven an hour). We were leaving the area and asked for a refund. First GYG said they‚Äôd refund us. When they didn‚Äôt we disputed the charge. In their rebuttal they said we had committed ‚ÄúFriendly Fraud‚Äù. - the company that fraudulently booked us and took our money!

Unbelievable. Use Viator. Much more reliable. An aggravating waste of time on vacation with family. | Loved my experience, tour, and guide!! | Horrible customer service.  I tried contacting ahead of my scheduled tour and received no response.  Once tour started and I contacted customer care they were no help and told me one thing while the actual vendor told me something different.  Then when I confronted the vendor the man called me a liar and stated that customer care did not say what I was informing them and do to it being through chat and conversation was over I could not prove my side and was denied my tour which I paid $182.00 for. | The app is well designed and easy to use.  I‚Äôve booked two tours in Spain and they both turned out very well.   I would use the app again in the future. | Photographer was 2 hours late, wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to shoot. Then he says 2-3 days to get photos back but it took a week. Wasn‚Äôt  professional at all. But photos did turn out nice ‚Ä¶. | See above | Obviously waist of time and money 
Flooded with advertising online and misleading customers! | The trip was really good, wish we had more time to shop and explore a little more but understand that it‚Äôs already a long tour considering how much time we are on the Bus.. Khan the guide was very helpful and knowledgeable made the trip way better..Remember to sit on the right side of the bus Passenger side! For the best views.. | We took a trip to SE Asia with many side trips. We booked those trips with Get Your Guide. We found that the providers of their services were were great. They communicated before the trip and were reliable. The trips were just as advertised and the guides were great. Our friends on the trip booked with another popular site and were very disappointed with the communication and reliability. We will definitely book through Get Your Guide. | I made a mistake when booking which was very easy to cancel and rebooked | I tried for too long. Deleted and reloaded the app. I cannot save any favorites using this app, so I have to start all over looking every time I use it. Upsetting. | Lousy experience 
If you want to speak to someone to cancel 
Well forget that this is a shifty operation | Typed in Bermuda got day trips in Barbados | I bought a Vatican tour with this app. The service provider postponed it last minute. When I showed up for the appointment they said o should come back in 2 hours. Went back 2 hours later , they said there was a miscommunication with Get My guide. I didn‚Äôt receive the service, nor I received any refund as both parties blame each other. My day was ruined as I spent many hours at the meeting point waiting for them to sort this out. I can‚Äôt believe this app has 4.9 stars average when all the recent reviews are 1 or 2 stars. Stay away! | Guillermo, Ruben, Lisa made our ATV experience the best it could be. From pick-up to drop-off was seamless.  Safari outfits you with windproof clothes and gloves, and a helmet. The experience was the only way to experience Iceland. | Easy, convenient and right at my finger tips to pick what event I want to participate in. | I would not use this company ever again. I had an issue with my tour that costedÔøº me Ôøº hundreds of dollars and when trying to resolve with the company, it‚Äôs been more than a month of them telling me to wait while they‚Äôre processing my request and when I call nobody can help me. Ridiculous. Ôøº not to mention their initial response was to offer me a $40 refund when it costed me over $800. The tours themselves were great but I would just go directly through the tour Ôøºcompany they contract with versus having GetYourGuide be the middleman if they‚Äôre not going to appropriately handle problems. | I can‚Äôt image a better way to spend in Scotland. Stephen was our guide and he was spectacular! Our daughter is 11 and she thought he was so funny and he has the best history stories. You must book this trip. You won‚Äôt regret it. | So exciting to look forward to new experiences I haven‚Äôt try myself and at a reasonable price!! Thank you, thank you! | This provider just gets you to buy tickets through them at the same price as at the venue but then forces you to download their app to download it. It‚Äôs pretty terrible all around. I lost my place in line as I had to find WiFi to download the app and then get a QR code. I could have just got my tickets at the venue without hassle. This is just another provider trying to get marketing info. | Sometimes the app is glitchy, but mostly works well, and always the staff is there to help. Considering they are a worldwide company it‚Äôs quite remarkable how well things go. I found it very helpful and locating and registering for specific tours. | They don‚Äôt require descriptions that help you if you have a problem such as if you‚Äôre late how you can catch up with the tour. My first time booking & I will not be back. | I was hesitant with downloading once again another app, but the experience with the GetYourGuide app has proved very useful and easy to use with all of the ticket vouchers and details included in each of the bookings. Highly recommend!! | I have used this app in Ireland and Japan as a US traveler and it has been very easy and reliable to use. All the information is available in the app once booked and the vendors reach out personally to your email as well with details.  I will continue to use this platform for future travel. | Very informative and user friendly.

Best ever üòÉ | Flying to Mexico | This app is a scam and it changed my reservation without authorization and then asked for extra money to get the ticket I booked for !!!!! Never use this app. Terrible terrible app | Love it | They are not working with customers they just know how to get your Money and not return it or make changes. As soon as booked my flight I realized its a city in Canada with same name and tried to contact cheapoair right away they said our sales are final. Buy your tickets through Google or airline website these guys are | Great opportunity to earn points and spend it to travel around the world, thank you so much. | Great organization & Thankful for the service | I‚Äôve used this a few times and they almost always double the cost of both hotels and flights. Just book with who you want to fly with and where you want to stay much cheaper | Bueno | Does not have current trip | Great price & I saved a lot. | Compr√© una maleta de 25kg, y Volaris no la acept√≥ por las medidas de la maleta y de hecho pesaba menos de los 25kg. Y me toc√≥ pagar otra vezüò° | After I booked the ticket and paid for that they call me to cancel the ticket then give me back the money . They tell me if you want that ticket you have to pay $100 more than the old price | Very problematic app. Unresponsive. | Best | I tried to change my Flight multiple times and spoke to an agent multiple time and never could get it changed. Ended up canceling my flight and have to pay $600 to get a new flight | When booking a flight it‚Äôs better to make sure ABSOLUTELY nothing will happen to prevent you from going. Not only do they charge the airline cancellation fee (normal and understandable) but they charge another $177 for their own cancellation fee which is absolutely ridiculous. I will advise everyone at all costs do not use this service. | I love using cheap o air | I added a checked luggage from Atlanta to Cleveland and from Cleveland to Atlanta. Instead of this they had it placed as a carry on and checked back to Cleveland. So to my surprise I had to pay $60.00 for a checked bag on my return trip. I will never use this service again! | Easy and convenient to use. Love the app and the website too | I love cheap o air | I will never use this app or company again. I will tell everyone what horrible service I have received | Very good app online | Very organized | It All Made Sense and it‚Äôs been great üëç | I use this app a lot unfortunately you can‚Äôt beat their prices. The real cost is if there is an error. They take no responsibility for errors on their part or the software malfunction. They will only care if you buy their over priced travel insurance policies. And those policies never seem to help if there is an error in your flight. 

I booked a flight for overseas. There was an error in their system so a last name was incorrect. When I called them, they said call the airline and they would fix it. The airline told me that Cheap O Air needed to change it. So I called them back and they said no and that if I just went to the airport the ticket agent could change it. So, I show up and they said no the vendor who sold the ticket needed to correct the last name. 

Very long story short, I missed my flight had to rebook and loose $1000 and change my flights causing delays and a worst flight intenirary that does not allow my wife and I and my infant son to sit together with some extra space. Our totally travel time is 24 hours with an infant. So our entire trip was changed and we have a terrible challanges to over come to keep us seated together so we can control our son so other passengers are not disturbed.

I have had similar issues with COA, but this was absolutely terrible. Besides the people who answer the phones have heavy Indian accents and they are difficult to understand in the middle of a crowded airport. 

Their prices are amazing and the customer service is terrible. As long as you have no issues with your booking, wrong spellings or incorrect last names, you will be fine. But if you need assistance to make your travel friendly, you will be met with a company that does not care if you make your travel plans as long as you buy more tickets from them. 

Good luck! It‚Äôs a gamble booking with Cheap O Air. But you might save money if you don‚Äôt have to rebook. | Cumple bien y en ella saco mis vuelos para ir a ver mi familia | I will introduce many customers to come here to experience .
Love guys | I was hours on hold to verify my payment information, so hard to get in touch with anyone they keep putting me with recordings my flight is the same day and I can‚Äôt get a confirmation so annoying and disappointing | Me gusta como puedo administrar mi cuenta | Excellent and accurate pricing | Tienen los mejores precios y el soporte es de buena calidad muy amable los de asistencia telef√≥nica | It won‚Äôt show up a ticket to review before submit the order. It is no way can change anything after the purchase. | I don't recommend | I have used this service two times in the last year. My daughter booked my first flight, and me my second. And I have to say that they have had amazing customer service at every turn. Thank you Freid for your help and patience. Keep up the good work guys. Thank you for your help so I can see my other daughter and grandson for my 55th birthday! | Your app is not easy . | Removing the option to redeem points into gift cards is disappointing and a deal breaker | After I purchased ticket . A lot of fone call and he keep talking talking didn't care I understand or not . Then my credit card keep charge extra . Then I chatted with customers service . She said I purchased non refundable package. I have to cancel from my credit card . Crazy | Easy and exactly what I needed. | I was allowed to get tickets for international trip! Even though I was refused entry at the international airport‚Ä¶due to visa!
This company charges people their hard earned money! Then throws their hands up..in moments of need!
They will basically blame you for not doing the things‚Ä¶.you paid for! | Absolutely the worst website to book a flight.
So many charges so many fees and you cannot . if you have to cancel Second later if you make a mistake, they will charge you for that..
My rating for you guys would be 0. | Nice and affordable to go on trips with family or friendsüòéü§™ü§© | I started getting points , yeaaahh | First, they couldn‚Äôt change my flight from TPE to TAC. Also, when I was on the phone with the rep the prices kept increasing from MNL to TAC Philippines as we were speaking. Plus, I was charged extra for the for one check-in luggage one way. You got me good!!! However, you lost me as a customer for life. In the future I will book my own flights directly with the airlines. I don‚Äôt TRUST CheapOair. | Buenos precios. | I‚Äôm very happy with this app. I‚Äôm has been book with this app since sept 2022 for traveling to Vietnam. And from to USA . It‚Äôs very easy to use and searching for cheaper options. I‚Äôm recommended for all of my friends. Thanks CheapOair. | Me encanta son muy buenosüëçüèª | They sell tickets where they are not responsible for any problem, and they easily and simply only rely on the fact that they cannot refund your money. | I bought the tickets for my brother family, from Pakistan to Manchester that was Etihad airways tickets for the whole family, and connected flight through Paris, whenever I bout the tickets they never told be connected flights through Paris you need transit visa, although they are just connecting through France airport not going outside of the airport, they just sold me tickets, when my brother family were on airport , there they said you need transit visa for going through France, when I talk with cheap o air, they said we will not refund you any single penny, even I called before the 4 hours departure, and they are giving me again 2nd day flight with almost 6000$ extra and the same problem you need transit visa, how the dump agent, if he is giving me next flight with same airline how we can get transit visa with the same time, he just try to sell his tickets with extra 6000$ , more, beware when you buy tickets from cheap O air, there agents and app did not give you proper guidance, worst experience with this company , I will not do any more business with this company, | O love the

Also the line was very long!  I don‚Äôt recommend it. | Worst verification app I‚Äôve ever tried to use. Trying to use it for verification on LinkedIn called support and they were unwilling to help. After scanning my id three times and it not working due to poorly made app design, I was locked out. After calling Clear they said, try again in a few months. Ridiculous | They are really terrible now. Oversubscribed. Longer & slower lines than tsa pre ant many airports. | This app doesn‚Äôt work at all! No matter how many selfies you take or how many times you upload your ID it never takes the picture properly no matter where you are or how the lighting is. It just fails constantly. Unlike one of their competitors, they offer no video call to have a live person manually verify anything. They rely exclusively on technology that just never anything but fails. | Such a waste of time. Repeatedly trying to add my ID. Tried multiple lighting, never takes. Went in for help chat. When I get bar to type my response or question, doesn‚Äôt allow my response to populate up in chat! On top, many airports have extremely rude checkin staff | Adding your id to this app is one of the most hideous experiences that you will ever have. One star just because they‚Äôve failed to fix that one feature that is incredibly easy to fix. | After paying for the service and signing up, I couldn‚Äôt actually verify any of my physical documents in the app. This led to issues at the gate, and the personnel could not sufficiently assist in this regard. Very disappointing experience! | I am not sure why they have an app.. It does not tell you to update your profile‚Ä¶ You have to do that at the Airport and if you do not update your profile at that time.. you can not use the Clear service you paid for and ask to get out of the line and go to regular TSA.  So even if you paid for this service do not count on that you will be able to use it‚Ä¶ If you ask to call customer support you can not as the number they lost always says they are closed and the online Chat (Kayle) has no way to help you use something you paid for while you are at the airport | This used to be great but now it takes longer than regular security. The NextGen+ upgrade doesn‚Äôt work and their staff are incredibly rude. Save your money, and if you are in a hurry just get TSA pre-check. | Agent at LAX airport never explained or introduced himself. Just said he will help me get to the front of the line and took me to the Clear machine. Said he will get it for free then started asking to input info. By this point, too late for me to back out because I initially thought he would get me to the front of the line out of good grace. Ended up spending longer signing up than waiting at security itself. He should have explained everything before hand instead of using pressure in the scheme of ‚Äúhelping cut line‚Äù . Had to get the app and cancel membership because it isn‚Äôt free. | Lady at the airport said we can cancel after a week of trial . It was supposed to be a free week but we got charged $288 dollars . And now I had to cancel my credit card and get a new one . IF YOU Don‚Äôt TRAVEL A-LOT DO NOT GET THIS ! | This will trick you in enrolling for free and notoriously will lead you to think that once you cancel your membership, thats it! Wrong! They will auto renew your membership and charge you card! | Helped us greatly! Last week we were running late for our plane to LA. We would not have made it if we had to stand in that long security line! I asked about the TSA PRE CHECK, the agent helped us sign up and be on our way around the line, straight to the front! Definitely felt like VIP, I recommend to anyone that travels a lot! | This useless app just can‚Äôt verify my selfie for LinkedIn verification. | International airports still don‚Äôt work even after they said they were added (and should have been years ago). Try SYD and others. Nothing.

Updated: works now after comment from dev they were rolling it out. Advise don‚Äôt put it in release notes if it‚Äôs not available. | The vast majority of reviewers left a one star rating; how does that add up to 4.7?? | Clear lines longer than TSA Pre.  Check in process waste even more time. | Nowhere does it say in the same up you can‚Äôt use this if you‚Äôre not a US citizen. Instead they wait till you queue up in the airport, give them your fingerprints and then they tell. Resulting in having to queue again. 
Cancelling is also extremely difficult as they keep telling my password is wrong and it‚Äôs not. 
Worst service and app!! | Only works if you travel within the United States, I have a flight to ST. Croix United States Virgin Islands it should work but doesn‚Äôt. Time to delete this app. | The service is awful‚Ä¶.you need to wait eternity to get some response‚Ä¶it seams like they watching interesting movie while chatting with you‚Ä¶and they don‚Äôt care what problem you was faced‚Ä¶ enough of this nonsense from me. Deleting. | It used to be a ‚Äúskip the line‚Äù service but it‚Äôs not any more.  Every time I try to use it, it‚Äôs broken.  The agents tell me how it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsoftware update‚Äù and you have to reregister. Every single time I have used clear on the last 3 years, clear SLOWED me down at the airport. Awful awful awful.  Save your money and do not get clear. | Tried it about five times in the last 2 months and I think I think it would have been faster off going through the regular PreTSA at DCA. Also, they always seem to have technical issues. Will definitely not renew. | Why would I pay more to get screwed at the airport and have regular security passengers get checked in way before I did. This is a rip off - clear is essentially regular security at this point and is false advertising. I would give this app 0 stars if I could. Absolutely useless and a waste of time that will actually cost you more time than saving time. | After having problems with my ID scaling into the app, I contacted customer service via chat (as instructed). The wait time was negligible but when the chat started it took them 20 minutes to look at my account before I could even tell them my problem. I‚Äôve had the account for a week there‚Äôs not that much to review. I was instructed to cancel my membership and start again. I inquired about my 3 months of clear plus that I was supposed to receive free and was instructed to use the promo code again. I pointed out that it wouldn‚Äôt work because I had already used it. After 15 minutes I was told to cancel my membership, pay for it and then he would give me 3 months free. I am not paying for it before I  try it and determine it it‚Äôs worth the $200.  After waiting for 10 minutes for a response I simply clicked out thinking I would let the person at the airport assist me. When I open the app today, I was surprised to see my account canceled. I can‚Äôt reuse the promo code either. What a waste of my time and energy. | There‚Äôs no reconciliation system or viable customer support for data errors. They collect the data and that‚Äôs it! No service provided. Simply horrible. | It is very strange for my that this service doesn‚Äôt work with prepaid phone plans I cannot varify my identity on LinkedIn because I have mint mobile prepaid plan. Their support advice me to change my phone number or carrier. It is very strange. So each client with prepaid plan cannot use their service It is ridiculous | This app really doesn‚Äôt do much and doesn‚Äôt really even need to be used to get on a flight so why do they need to update it literally twice a week?  Once a month is even more than enough. Huge battery life drain downloading and installing this with auto update every few days. | I have attempted over 50 times to take a picture of my ID and passport and it keeps saying it won‚Äôt read. I have followed all of the instructions and it keeps saying it won‚Äôt read. | Poor customer service. App not fully functioning. | More than half of the airports I try to use Clear on don‚Äôt even have Clear so why are you selling it like every airport does this is kind of been a waste of my money. Where do I find the airports that actually use clear? | The experience was weird and complicated and difficult, I repeated the registration process again at the airport, I can't believe that a company and app made the experience of using technology so complicated, it was really awful, I canceled the membership, it was very expensive. | The app is good to contain all my travel ID information and to keep my membership information someplace.  The other features like flight tracking is extremely buggy and doesn‚Äôt work correctly.  When I tried to get support, either it was an AI just as buggy or an illiterate person.  Either way, I question if my information is safe or could it be compromised. | In the last year of 40 flights clear has failed to once be easier or faster than precheck, save your money | I landed in Detroit airport and the Clear line was longer (a lot longer) then the regular TSA Pre-Check line.  This has happened quite a bit lately, so just keep that in mind when go to the airport and in your justification for purchasing clear. | Like the title says, the app seems to work okay, but for no reason should anyone waste money on a Clear membership, as you end up paying more just to wait longer.  The concept is great, but Clear has failed to implement the process properly and provide any real value.  End result: DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON CLEAR. | Flying with Clear helps my trips to be easier and less stress!  Scanning my eyes or fingers are easy and reduces my wait time in in the Security Lines! Clear Team are always upbeat and personable as well as courteous!

Money well spent! | Can‚Äôt scan my id, image is out of focus. I‚Äôd imagine this is a problem with the macro lens and the app not supporting the camera api. Will revise review when it works. | App does not work, I can‚Äôt log in | I went to website to set up my account but the app won‚Äôt allow me to enter any of my information. | Subpar dev and qa efforts go to this app. They cant even get the basics right | Had a temporary license and tried to use my military ID for registration which they don‚Äôt take?! Wasted 30min before my flight just to get in the back of the line. I don‚Äôt understand why people pay for this service. | When you need a helpful app and they say I have one for you. This app is not it. Waste of time and money on development‚Ä¶ please start over,  from scratch‚Ä¶ | Continued to fail to identify me and support told me that you cannot verify your identity unless your name is on your phone company‚Ä¶ so a wife cannot verify her identity if her phone plan is under her husbands name‚Ä¶ | I was trying to use this to quickly go through the TSA line.  It took me the entire time of waiting in line for TSA for it to finally accept my passport, don‚Äôt waste your time. | All I get are error messages and there is no reason for it- all my docs are up to date and legit. I tried to reach out for help but was #30 in line. | Love being able to cut to the front. Also it‚Äôs hit or miss. After paying a premium for the clear+, going through Denver has left me wanting. Watching tsa recheck move faster than clear may have tipped the scales. Good app. Good idea. Starting to get behind imo.

Edit: scratch that. The gentleman trying to help me was incompetent. Then to top things off he tries holding my ID cause he wants to walk me through. Oh and passport isn‚Äôt good enough get verified?!? Canceled. Not worth it. | The age of getting value out of Clear has long passed. I fly out of DEN every few days, and you can always expect the Clear line being the *longest* line at the airport, every time. Thankfully with Precheck I can hop over and actually breeze through security, while the Clear line wraps around down the halls and around escalators. I‚Äôve been a member for 6 years or more, but it‚Äôs coming to and end now. Paying this company for the privilege of waiting LONGER at security is wild. They exist for one purpose and can‚Äôt meet that basic expectation. Great product that was severely tanked. Good riddance, Clear. | The Clear Rep told me, if you‚Äôre in a hurry use regular TSA Pre Check. Why am I paying $250 per year then? | This app is horrible!

I can not take a clear photo of my drivers license with the app‚Äôs built in camera setup. I have an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and have no issues using other apps to take a photo of my different forms of ID. 

The app‚Äôs built in camera setup keeps making the photos come out blurry. The phone is perfectly stable and it doesn‚Äôt matter if I get closer or farther away from my ID, the photos just come out blurry. My ID is on a solid black background with no light glare, great natural lighting and it still can‚Äôt take a non-blurry photo. 

There is no way to use my Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max macro mode for better photo enhancements like I can for any other photo I take using phone which makes no sense. 

Also, the app does not allow you to upload a photo of your ID that‚Äôs already on your phone. I have perfectly clear, close-up, front and back photos of all my ID cards and passport in my phone‚Äôs photo library. Why you have to take a photo and can not upload them makes no sense. 

This app description acts like it‚Äôs so high tech and professional but these are basic features for any app in 2023. I don‚Äôt understand how an app with these issues could have made it to release. This tells me the developers have not and do not test their apps prior to release. 

There are multiple other reviewers with the same issue but clearly nothing has been done. If the developers of this app read my entire review‚Ä¶ PLEASE correct these simples issues asap. | signing up for this will steal hundreds of dollars from you monthly, they wont let me cancel my

Please 1st take me to my current flight based on my phone number. | Thanks | Had to do everything twice and now with the portals you sent I cantfind my trip information or seat confirmation very very frustrating | Son lo mejor | Everything was excellent. The food was awesome and the servers and wait staff were all wonderful  especially the older host in the restaurant inside the hotel they made me feel so special for my birthday. | Muy buenos presios | Like title says enjoy !! ‚ô•Ô∏è | Too many changes, I like the old app better. Harder to use now. | I used your web site for renting a car and when I went to pick it up at ACE the price had tripled‚Ä¶.what a deal .
Thanks but no thanks. I will never use your site again. I wanted to give a zero star but that choice is not available. | AI | I needed to purchase a round trip ticket for my friend coming NASCAR weekend at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Oct 13-16,2023.
Quickly, I was able to find a round trip, with carry on & insurance for $286. We think it was a good deal. It was easy to navigate there website. | I tried to book tickets on this app and was charged over $400 with no tickets confirmed. I got an email stating I was charged $0.00 for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FLIGHT than what I was trying to book for. Like the airline was wrong, the to and from state was wrong, this is INSANE.

Room was clean; bedding and towels were clean and although that may be a ‚Äúduh‚Äù statement, we have stayed at another brand hotel where the drapes and blankets and bed spreads were full of cigarette burn holes and the towels had hair in them.

No service in room No garbage, No towels, No Cups, No beds made. We complained and had to go get our own towels to shower.  Electrical plugs don‚Äôt work in half of room.  Smelled bad in Halls. We were not happy at all. Ask the day we were checking out for some kind of payment back to card. Nothing! Breakfast was ok it the same everyday never changes. Lobby was pretty decorated for Christmas. The Shuttle drivers were very nice they took us to NJ Transit. Just remember they Don‚Äôt pick up after 11:00pm. Your on your own then.

And thank you again | I would of given this a better review but when say a word in Greek it most of time comes out as a completely different word.

But if type it it does translate it correctly | This app is very helpful and overall a gift. However, there are many text-to-speak options missing for formerly colonised African languages. 

For example they have Igbo, one of many languages spoken in Nigeria, but they do not have text-to-speak options. 

Naturally someone will say that since there are so many languages, Google cannot get the text-to-speech feature for all of them. 

They will also say they hope to get around to it like they have for other African languages, but sadly the countries which once tried to erase the existence of these languages have long since been fully featured on the app.

There seems to be a prioritising of languages which allows some to be fully featured, while others waste away in waiting with hopes of being recognised by the world, though many taste the use of them on their tongues. 

I hope to one day have text-to-speech for Igbo and many other African languages, but I am tempted to think it would be unwise to wait with bated breath. That being said, I still appreciate this remarkable resource. | So I can no longer use Google Translate with my iPhone 7 because of this change.

There are so many cool things to do and see. We recommend it to any of our friends that are traveling. Great app. | I installed it and to its credit it did have some neat information. It‚Äôs locked in the position where it installed and can‚Äôt be moved. I tried to uninstall it and I cannot. It‚Äôs been he only app on my phone that isn‚Äôt iPhone proprietary that doesn‚Äôt allow it to be uninstalled. I don‚Äôt trust this app and want it gone. | enjoy it on a daily basis. this is the way i start my day. we bought the boxed book set too. | Honestly the community is amazing but the app is so riddled with bad ux and ui decisions like why are yall making an api call every time i change a filter just make the whole thing when i hit done?? Hire me to fix your app i am begging you | Love this site!! I use it everywhere I travel and enjoy seeing and experiencing more things than the average tourist. I am always amazed at the awesome Sites and little known destinations that they have compiled. I even used it near my house in upstate New York and despite living in the area for 44 years, still found cool places I‚Äôd never heard of or been to. I tell everyone that is going anywhere to use Atlas Obscura | Atlas Obscura is not just an app; it‚Äôs a magic carpet ride to the most extraordinary corners of our planet. Its user-generated content brings to light the less trodden paths and uncovers sights and landmarks that traditional guides often overlook. This app is the epitome of adventure and discovery, perfect for those yearning to explore beyond the ordinary.

The interface of Atlas Obscura is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through its vast network of wonders. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned traveler or a curious explorer in your backyard, the app tailors its discoveries to suit your location and interests. It‚Äôs like having a knowledgeable friend in your pocket, always ready to show you something fascinating.

One of the most striking features of Atlas Obscura is the diversity of its content. From awe-inspiring natural formations to quirky roadside attractions, the app covers an eclectic mix of places that are both informative and entertaining. Each location is accompanied by detailed descriptions, user reviews, and often, mesmerizing photographs that stir the wanderlust in you.

Moreover, the app fosters a sense of community among users. You can contribute by adding new locations, sharing your experiences, or offering tips, which makes Atlas Obscura a living, evolving atlas of the world‚Äôs wonders. This communal aspect adds depth to the app, making it more than just a guide‚Äîit‚Äôs a platform for sharing and discovery.

However, it‚Äôs important to note that while Atlas Obscura opens the door to hidden gems, some locations might require careful planning to visit. The app does a great job in providing essential information, but it‚Äôs always wise to do additional research, especially for remote or less accessible places.

In conclusion, Atlas Obscura is a treasure trove for adventurers and curious souls. It‚Äôs an invitation to step off the beaten path and plunge into a world of fascinating discoveries. For anyone looking to spice up their travels with unique, offbeat destinations, this app is a must-have. It‚Äôs not just about places; it‚Äôs about experiencing the myriad stories and wonders that our world has to offer. | I absolutely swear by using this app when I travel to find amazing sightseeing and experiences and real world ""Easter eggs""... but it isn't without its frustrastions:

- Currently, newly marked places I've visited no longer give me a grey flag. This makes it confusing to see where I should go next. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling even, to no avail.
- After awhile with the app in use, you'll get an error message ""something went wrong"" and can't mark anything, and you'll need to restart the app and refind the location to mark. I've had this problem since I started using this a whole year ago and it is still not resolved!!

Also, as a suggestion, I like that places that are permanently closed are still featured, but could be helpful to give them a distinguished color marker, like red or something (but still allow gray flag for those who visited before shutdown). 

Also, when clicking ""Directions"", it uses my Google Maps, but would be nice if it have me the option to use Apple Maps instead (like Happy Cow app lets me do). 

I want to give it 5 stars, but these bugs sometimes break my flow while I'm exploring. | Good content for atlas obscura but really the app needs some work. Jerky, hangs, not usable at times. | Never fails to enlighten and inform with fascinating articles. | I‚Äôve only been working with the app for a couple of hours but I‚Äôm finding it very difficult to navigate.  It‚Äôs not intuitive, its slow and clunky. I‚Äôm finding basic tasks,  like adding the countries I‚Äôve been to,  really hard to complete.  Maybe it‚Äôs me, and I just need more time with it but I still feel like it shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to work with. | I love Atlas Obscura, and this app is overall wonderful but I sure wish links would open in the app rather than my browser | Only got this yesterday - it‚Äôs great. Helps with vacation planning in a big way. | I love the website and the content, but the app is janky. One major issue is it hangs when trying to filter results. | This app works well and the information is great! I have so many places I want to see and so many I‚Äôve seen and I can put both in separate lists. | Awesome app for the travel who likes off the beaten path. Only downside is the actual map, hard to use on a iPhone. | I travel a lot for work and my photography hobby, and I *love* going to the places I see on this app. Doing so helps me learn about the history, architecture, ecosystems, and sometimes reveals photo opportunities I wouldn‚Äôt have found on my own. It also keeps growing as people add sites so if I go to the same city multiple times there are sometimes new suggestions to check out. I love it! | My family and I love this app. They were many times that we went on vacation and ran out of things to do so we open the app and search for surroundings. | I love atlas Obscura, but the app is glitchy. When you are trying to view places, it won‚Äôt let you click the lists and clicking a hashtag doesn‚Äôt work very well either. | Earth‚Äôs most exciting travel app. You‚Äôre shortcut to what is interesting and off the beaten path. | We just had a wonderful lunch there. The wait went by quickly the food was delicious. Best of all our server, Claudia was delightful. Highly recommend First Watch. | Great app, fun when you travel to a new place! 
Cleveland Rocks! | One of the top 10 apps on the App Store. The store would not be complete without it. | A must-have for any avid traveller. Full of surprising finds and always interesting to explore! üåè üåé üåç | My scoring of 0 was completely wrong. 
5 Baby! | Love road trips and unusual attractions. This is a perfect road trip companion! | Hard to figure out and save routes and attractions | After starting a list, the newly created one doesn‚Äôt appear in selection to add other locations. Also no way to delete lists. | Any time I go anywhere, I check with Atlas Obscura to see what else I could see there | Would like to see an iPad version of the app.  The content is great and a more advanced search would be fantastic! | I‚Äôve used this app and their website to find the lesser known attractions. I love the history and stories. You will too! I tell all my friends and family about this whenever they say they are traveling . | Glad this is finally in app form, but sad the add location feature is broken since I know some wonderful nooks and crannies | The app is really hard to navigate and is missing features from the website. It‚Äôs a completely different experience, so if you like the site you probably won‚Äôt like the app and vice versa | I love the obscurity | I would love to hear a podcast or read about the Tarahumara abilities to run and how they live | Trying to add places I‚Äôve been to the map, not working. | The world has nothing but bad news, or so it seems.  This is a reason to turn on the iPad. | Right out of the gate it‚Äôs my first time using the app and it will not simply load when I try to pick an interest to search ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Closed the app and tried again and it still just sits on the loading categories screen and never loads anything. WTH? | AO is an amazing resource | This app is my favorite now! I love seeing new interesting places to check out of just admirer. Make a Bucket list! Lol very well made and beautiful pictures to boot! | Traveling in London and Paris, and this app has amazing info for finding the most interesting and unusual sites. But if you want to use the app features (been there, want to go, new place, etc) it often doesn‚Äôt work. It just says to try again, and again and again. | Look I love atlas obscura and I use this app literally all the time. It has serious bugs- when you press the options to note if you‚Äôve been to a place or would like to go to it, the app freezes for a time until it‚Äôs ok to use again. Very slow. Also, the loading takes a really long time with the ad at the start, like 1-2 minutes. It crashes often, or forgets my login info and I have to restart the app. In general, it‚Äôs not very good. I turn to using just the regular atlas obscura page in my browser often when out and about to compensate, but I want to use this app with amazing potential! It just needs a thorough debugging and someone with good coding skills to go through, put some money on this atlas obscura, it could be so so great. Also there should be a rating system for entries- some things on here aren‚Äôt really fit for the ‚Äúobscura‚Äù definition, like boring historians get lost, get cooler, find better spots that fit here not just random history factoids that amuse you but nobody else. It needs a clean up and more curating by users. | It is absolutely excruciating to try to figure this app out. First of all it‚Äôs a Google wannabe. It‚Äôs literally a glorified Google. You can only pin what is already posted. Meaning if you have been in London, you can only pin the map of places that are available from the list. Absolutely ridiculous. If you want to add a place it has to go through a review, whom knows how long that takes. I am not wasting anymore of my time with this app | I use Atlas Obscura on all my travels.  I‚Äôve shared it with many friends.  Truly a highly useful app. | Is this app meant to be useable past the home page? | So glad this exist!! | It has been fun finding out of the way spots. | Always interesting. Always compelling. A brief spot of intelligence in a normally bleak and absurd landscape.

We will be canceling our membership. Our United Club passes were not honored in Punta Cana. I reached out several times to have our passes extended so we could use them on our next trip. We never received them. Next we saw a $125 credit to change our flights to next day, once we were in WiFi range, we went back on the site within an hour. The same seats were all available however the rates were doubled. I contacted customer service and received no assistance. I asked to use miles to make the change and was told no. There is no point in keeping this membership. The customer service is poor. The airline has terrible press in their planes. I just don‚Äôt see any point in continuing this membership. Meanwhile, Southwest, AA and Hawaiian airlines have been more than accommodating when anything has come up throughout the years. | I get an error on the app, ""Payment cards and passes in Wallet will not work automatically while ""United"" is in use"", and can't add boarding passes to the Wallet using the app (though it works fine from the united.com site). This is the only place I could find to send this feedback. | I had a seat change and received 4 emails, 4 texts, plus app notifications. Enough already!?!? | A real challenge to find my boarding pass. | Good service | Place # number of bags to check before the screen shows 0 | Online  check-in was simple even for technological dinosaurs like me. | Your mobile site said my Zip code was invalid, so I couldn‚Äôt use my credit card for baggage, even though I had already put that card in for onboard purchases. | When presented with the option-in to do the wallet-less TSA option, there is a screen that pops up that is blank. The page has NO text, and blue and white option buttons have no text. Thus it had me going around in the same loops of questions. Finally, when I hit the white button it let me out; I was able to proceed. I have no idea of what I clicked on. Tell your developers the is some bug there. | Can‚Äôt remember having a nonstop flight! Love it! | Loved | Haven‚Äôt travelled in several years but the only issue with the app so far is it doesn‚Äôt access credit cards on my device for faster payment | Excellent | Excellent airline and service | For international travelers, impossible to make a credit card payment for baggage unless you have a USA phone number and USA address. I lucky to buy my seat with my miles otherwise that also would have being a problem. To make payment.  
today notice while checking into the flight I was tricked via internet travel agency into a basic economy flight. I would never buy such ticket on international flights. I‚Äôve flown enough in my life never to purchase such ticket | Could not check bag in advance. The app kept rejecting my zip code on billing address | What‚Äôs the purpose of downloading the app if you can‚Äôt even upload or enter the information it‚Äôs asking and a message comes up stating to see an agent instead at the airportü§îü§® | Super easy check in, I like it | Terrible app | With a ticket over $700 it‚Äôs not acceptable that you don‚Äôt give minimun a carry on | I cannot add one passport, and no error message | On Saturday March 23 the entire east coast was having a heavy storm causing considerable delay.  The senior member of the boarding crew did a superlative job keeping customers in the lounge waiting for news on departure.  The line of communication was excellent.  The flight path was changed to a more westerly route with zero turbulence.  We arrived later than scheduled but safe and very satisfied.  Hoorah United!! | United is the worst airline and that says a lot as it falls behind delta, American, etc. 

It‚Äôs app is terrible and you can‚Äôt view your boarding pass. 

Never flying United again. | Always easy to manage site! | New update broke app features, pages don‚Äôt load (can‚Äôt see change flight options),  flights load incorrectly (airport incorrect, it eventually fixes itself if I have it open long enough) | Smooth and easy check on | I missed my flight!  The screenshot of my boarding pass said the wrong terminal and wrong gate up until the time of the flight. | Very low as when I asked for assistance with getting baggage tags and the representative messed up and I was over charged $200. | United has always been a 5 star app, but with the recent release I am no longer able to simply track my incoming flight and see if it‚Äôs left the prior gate or is delayed. The track my plane using flight aware is completely useless as it provides no information that is needed to track my flight.   It‚Äôs fine as an add on, but as a frequent flyer I need the details.  United is no longer and all in 1 app and I will now have to find something yo use alongside it.  This is a huge disappointment and inconvenience. | Didn‚Äôt let me check bag. Said something went wrong and didn‚Äôt let me know what | Thank you soooo very much for your GREAT assistance! This is very helpful I appreciate it. | Fly Southwest and 2 bags are free. | Just one of many examples: trying to check bags ahead of time in the app, it offers you an option to identify yourself as military, since United offers free checked bags for active duty, like most other major airlines. But then the app tries to charge you for the bags anyway, so you have to back out, click ‚Äòno bags‚Äô and do it at the airport instead. | Flight check in process a circular looping nightmare never saving passport scans just continuously asking to reupload everything what a disaster this app is! | Very flexible, informative & practical thank you | I‚Äôm don‚Äôt mind adding my cc number but I very much dislike having to add the cvv code. This should be optional and allow me enter it when using the card. This provides an extra layer of security to my card information. | Could be more streamlined without all the extra stuff you throw at a person. Upsell, upsell, upsell. Gets old. | This is fantastic service | Have not flown United for awhile. Worst, most confusing check in process ever. With planes falling apart and horrid on line processes you must be TRYING to go out of business. | Hard to use | Chat was excellent! | Horrible seats were seats issue | Perfect & easy. Great job everyone. | Boy Genius Scott Kirby doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that literally no one cares about their app when they have a dismal on time record and the app only serves as a means to tell you that your flight is delayed or cancelled. United AIRLINES. It‚Äôs about the travel which they currently are failing miserably at managing not some stupid app. | Love this airline been traveling with united for years and love it | App tells you where your second flight gate but not your landing gate! With one hour at LAX this info is critical!!! | Overall a great app, recently the add to calendar feature doesn‚Äôt work on my iPhone 15 pro.  When I ‚Äúview details‚Äù under trips.  Hoping the dev team reads this. | We received email from United our seats were changed. We paid for premium economy and we were rebooked to the back of plane. It took 3 calls and constantly being put on hold for over an hour to resolve the issue. Could barely understand the service agent and she was inexperienced and had to talk to supervisor 4 times because she had no idea how her own system worked.",4.76972,6070143,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d0/f3/70/d0f370ca-3dfd-14d7-864b-e69c2cebf353/eea244cc-f95c-4efa-850b-62574c5d59db_1242x2208bb-6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/23/92/1a/23921a49-59c1-f843-b260-78dad5eb0698/c04d52fa-9b3b-42a1-add7-2df45dd68755_1242x2208bb-7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6d/9a/9c/6d9a9cd6-fb04-25d5-1fbe-a51d4080fc2a/77bb9ef3-ce16-49d4-93cf-a1f177002801_1242x2208bb-8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/cb/59/9f/cb599f11-4dd9-dc96-7097-f0ed6add1bfc/a10d52aa-1108-4cf5-8a8b-270d1fb1fd9f_1242x2208bb-9.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/78/b8/24/78b82444-4199-30ca-64af-bbc430265add/1541d19f-3789-4d88-8746-cd53be638471_1242x2208bb-10.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/76/0d/2e/760d2ed6-9b69-bba7-7584-ffc0a9a5bd9a/c8dc81f1-7abf-4754-a09c-886c0288e43e_2048x2732bb-12.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/97/e6/78/97e67872-a7bb-9452-6e97-adfb7f9b014d/c39444b4-08eb-4d70-adf0-180174ae85de_2048x2732bb-13.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6a/c0/f5/6ac0f58d-237c-f8cc-919d-75e73a2d9001/5437548a-4f37-4bf1-9df5-e635a9c319fe_2048x2732bb-14.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/82/0c/8d/820c8d85-3cfe-03ca-5c04-2806b89b909d/3763fde0-d874-4425-9478-27cf2849d3c4_2048x2732bb-15.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d3/33/c9/d333c918-bedd-075a-877b-9051f7e51b9b/57300edc-011a-49c4-b8b4-49bab923e73a_2048x2732bb-16.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

You can‚Äôt see vouchers in their app, there are tours where they won‚Äôt tell you the pick up point and sometimes for refunds they will ask you to talk to the tour operator.

Unreal. Better apps out there. Avoid. | I have booked several tours with this organization, and the tours are always great. In addition to great tours, their customer service and responsiveness is amazing. I will always use them. | I have used ViaTour in several different countries, including Australia/NZ, Europe and Asia, and have never been disappointed. On the few occasions I had had to cancel, the process was easy and full refund was received within two days. | Looks like it has some great activities but you can‚Äôt sign up as a single person, 2 is the lowest number of people in any of the tours I looked at. | My ticket ended being scheduled for a week after my planned one, not only the operator noticed when I asked for help neither they will refund you or allow you to use the $$ in a different tour. I didn‚Äôt even wanted the money but the tickets in a different day | The app itself is super handy, but it‚Äôs hobbled by its inability to add events to your calendar unless you let it have full calendar access. There is absolutely no reason this app needs to be able to READ every event on my calendar other than to collect and sell my private data. iOS allows you to set calendar permissions to ‚ÄúAdd Events Only,‚Äù but the app won‚Äôt add events with that option selected. There‚Äôs no excuse for that. | In my opinion it is wrong for a company to block reviews they don't like under the excuse of ""community standards.""
I'm not alone. Read the most recent reviews. Lots of 1 stars. | Poor | Haven't gone wrong yet.  Great guides and always fun.  Have made new friends. | Book through any other travel site, and you will find a better price. Just test it for yourself and see that [Viator] has a huge markup. Further, when you send them quotes from other sites showing the better price, [Viator] will still refuse to match the price, even though it‚Äôs in their guarantee. | Having same issues as most recent review from Geoz777. Go into the app and it sends a link to email. Email link opens in browser and the app doesn‚Äôt recognize that the link has been opened, making it impossible to actually sign into my account on the app. 

Note to developers - maybe use a 4 digit code sent to the email that can be manually entered into the app for confirmation. The link thing clearly isn‚Äôt working as intended. | Got the app. It asks for my email. Then sends a link. I click on the email and it takes me to the browser version of the site. It recognizes me as a past customer. Then there is a link to the app.  Click on that link and it asks for my email. Start all over and can‚Äôt get out of the loop. Tried help but no links to customer service. üòµ‚Äçüí´ | helped me book a fun affordable excursion for my trip ! | It will not work if you try to only allow access to add to calendar. It wants full access to your calendar. This is too invasive. Tours are easy to book and manage though, other than that | If your experience goes well then the app is great. I called support for help with a booking for them only to screw it up and cause additional problems. 

I was charged a different amount then the confirmation email and spoken with multiple people to try to resolve. I have received plenty of emails asking for reviews, which I have left. 
Activity: good
Viator support experience: terrible

I even asked for someone to contact me and have not been contacted. I spoke with someone today who was able to refund the difference of the cost to the correct amount on my confirmation email. 

If your still reading my advice: avoid 3rd party apps like this and book directly from the source | I used the website and app twice in Hawaii and in DC. The recommendations and descriptions have worked out each time. Enjoyed each tour and trip without a mishap. I always recommend it since. | We have always recommended and used Viator. | If you don‚Äôt know , this island can be expensive ,  but with this app I found all the amusement i was interested in for a very low exciting price so thank you so much for being so convenient towards my fun factor and my wallet. Also I  earned some dollar rewards towards my next purchases. That‚Äôs Awesome  , I‚Äôm enjoying this app and taking full advantage for my future adventures. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç | I booked a hot air balloon ride in Mexico City to see the pyramids in November. The tour company called me the night before to inform me I needed to reschedule. I could not as I was on travel and I requested a refund immediately. 

They didn‚Äôt answer for about a month so I disputed the claim on my card. Viator proceeded to fight (and won) my dispute and I‚Äôm now stuck with just under $500 in charges for services I didn‚Äôt receive. I‚Äôm never using this service again. | Major Bug

Cannot sign in on app. 

Steps:
- download app
- login (enter email)
- email sent to you
- click on link
- logged into viator in browser
- w/in browser click on Get Buttons in App
- sends to App Store to download. 
- open app
- process continues in this loop

*** also the download pdf doesn‚Äôt download anything

*** trying to add a password to account freezes the browser window. | Unable to move tickets from my email into this app to save my life, have sent email links into and out of 3 different mobile browsers, only to end up back at the same ‚Äúcheck email‚Äù screen.

Making it extremely difficult to prepare effectively for my upcoming trip | I wanted to book a tour, but they require a date of birth.  How absurd.  Why would they need that.  They lost business of that. | As a solo traveler, it‚Äôs nice to have an easy way to book and check excursions. I have booked two excursions for my first trip to Puerto Rico and it is nice that they you give you the option to reserve your spot and pay later. App is very user friendly. | Tours and events are canceled frequently due to ‚Äúsmall group size‚Äù | This app good | I can no longer access any of my booked tours, even to check times and locations,  without allowing for for push notifications. | Someone on a different device sharing the same WiFi network was automatically logged into my Viator account without me having used their device. Lawsuit waiting to happen. Hope their dev team is able to rectify this immediately. | I booked an experience that was a scam. The people told us we could get a refund but Viator did not give it to us, they protected the scammers, be very careful booking experiences through this app. | Have spent 40mins trying to login. Directs me to a one time email which then directs me to safari to sign in. All good. Then I try to access tickets and open up the app to it asking me to do a one time email login, and the entire cycle repeats. Seems like a great directory for services but doesn‚Äôt matter if I can‚Äôt access my tickets | I have used Viator for many travels and in different countries. I have never had any issues. Very accommodating site. | Not able to login through app. The email only redirects to the browser | There is strongest storm hitting bay on Feb-4/Feb-5, for international traveler that arrived and want to cancel result in no refund and pay 100% due to weather. Not recommended! | Viator is great but the app isn‚Äôt.

You would think when you buy something it is downloaded to the app, so you have it even if their is no internet. But no.

When I try to open it to get my tickets, I have to give my email address. It then offers to send a one time link to my email that opens to the same Home Screen that asks me for my email address. 
Viator customer service was great and sent me copies of the tickets. But don‚Äôt count on getting in with the app. | Easy to use and communicate with local providers. | The only thing the app does is give you a message that it can‚Äôt connect. It reminds me of the ‚Äútechnical difficulties‚Äù placard on 1978 television. | The app needs to show the full itineraries for the things we have booked. Not just the start times and meeting points. I‚Äôd like to see the full itinerary. I hope that‚Äôs something the app can change. | I hope this message helps other people when booking for what is believed a reputable company.

I purchase an all inclusive pass for activities in Berlin for 48 hours, back in September. I communicated with Viator right away and as I was waiting in line; Viator failed to provide us with proper QR codes, refused a refund and lost about $203.00 and the time to fully enjoy Germany. So, I Lost money, time and will take no responsibility to help, please read the BBB and you been warned | Can‚Äôt wait ! | Very efficient and convenient to find tours, etc. | Wow!  Just wow... I've seen bad interfaces but this takes the cake as far as Viator's actual app is concerned.  Just use the web site, don't waste your time w/their app! | When I looked for tours of Ann Frank house there was only one called the Ann Frank tour but apparently it did not include the house. I found that very misleading and annoying. | We recently booked a tour in Paris, we missed the our due to flight was delayed overnight, I called Viator to reschedule but there is no availability so a $550 wasted. Viator said their local tour operator refused to refund which I can understand, but Viator should at least have a solution for this type of situation, such as give us credits for future tour. | I have tried accessing my tickets 8 times both online via mobile device and the viator app but the two just keep asking me to confirm by logging into the other one. I even recently installed, uninstalled, and installed the app again. | Gone are the days of exceptional customer service‚Ä¶.except when it comes to Viator! I am quite impressed with now three times in dealing with their customer service. They are on it! They hire well. | Yes the Mt Cook/Lake Tekapo day trip from Christchurch is stunning and not to be missed. However, I do have to give a big two thumbs up to Viator. I booked this trip at the last minute during high peak season. They were able to squeeze my son and I in. They were in constant communication and very responsive to emails in arranging a pickup point as we were not staying at a hotel. On a 13.5 hour bus trip you need a great tour guide and Anuj was more than that. He kept a great schedule to ensure everyone had sufficient time at all the rest stops/scenic spots. He even dropped some of the passengers to late eateries when most places were closed when we returned to Christchurch. | I couldn‚Äôt get my tickets downloaded from my email. It told me to download the app, so I did. Every time I would try to get my tickets in the app it would tell me to click on the link from the email. So I would, and it would send me right to the app telling me to open the email link. It was seriously so annoying. | The problem with Viator comes when something from your tour or travel goes wrong. I had the necessary proof that a tour company did not try to help us when they lost us in a tour and Viator sited with them and did not refund. After all the proof and went after every detail that happen they said they‚Äôre unable to grant me a refund because the company denied any wrong doing. Go to another app for booking because Viator will never have your back even after proof. Just look at the other comments. | App is easy to use and book expeditions!!! | I arch what you pay for I had an island hoping package in boracay and after waiting for 2 hours and getting my calls declined from your guises I asked for my money back and Viator Al said it won‚Äôt refund money even though I am at pickup spot and had called a day b4 I would not recommend it almost ruined my proposal moment super upset | Viator is fantastic! I have used it in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. and it‚Äôs awesome every single time! I don‚Äôt want to use anything else for fun traveling

I have been anle to pin every place I have been  over my lifetime!  With the new categories you can now now customize it for your special places, like my UNESCO Wirld Heritage Sites. | I used to keep a travel map with pins, but it became awkward and outdated.  I looked for a replacement and found Pin Traveler when I'd just begun an island cruise to Greece.  I loved dropping pins for every island and historic site I visited.  I loved it so much that I purchased the Lifetime Membership within days of installing it. 

I gave it only four stars, as I sometimes find navigating the features awkward and non-intuitive.  Reading the help solves some of that, but my biggest hurdle is lumping pins into a single trip.  And once a pin is dropped, it's hard (for me) to add it to a trip.  I'm hoping a new feature including easy to create and edit multi-stop trips will be added.

Additionally, since Apple has made it possible for some iPhone apps to work on Macs as well, I have been trying this out on an M2 MacBook Pro. It seems to work well, is stable, and using the trackpad as a ""pinch and drag"" device works well. 

I hghly recommend thi app, and I look forward to the updates and improvements coming soon. | What a great app! I really like a record of places I‚Äôve traveled to. Thanks! | Amazing app that lets you track your travels! Customer support is swift and reliable! Highly recommend! | I was looking for an easy way to track the places, states, cities, and countries that I have been to and experienced over my lifetime. Doing it the ‚Äúold fashioned way‚Äù of pinning a world map was no longer working for me. I came upon the Pin Traveler app and quickly discovered that it is a great tool! Full disclosure, I recently needed to extend the app to my iPad and admittedly mistyped my email address. I reached out to the app owner and they were very swift and helpful! I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys traveling! | Simple and easy to use with room for improvement. | This is a perfect tool to keep track of your travels. It is easy to use, and works as advertised. Fun! | I've been looking for a substitute for TripAdvisor's Travel Map for some time.  This is it. These guys have a simple, clean, and robust platform. Unlike trip advisor they are extremely helpful and the data is yours...not trapped behind some protected server.  I'm moving all my pins over now and they even have offered to help make the switch!  

Thanks guys. Great App. | Excellent, but how would you even be able to obtain the North Korea flag(unless you‚Äôre an important person)? | It‚Äôs very hard to use. I keep changing the color of the pins‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.they are still red. | If you have been to more than 50 places you have to pay! No thanks! Removing app from my device! | The title of my review says it all. You cannot do anything without joining so it was wasted time to download. | This is by far the best travel journal I have!
I tried mutiple ones and this is the only one
 I ended up keeping and loving! Sure you have to pay for a lifetime premium but it's like buying yourself a travel diary and it will store all your memories forever! Every feature that I wanted on a travel diary is on this app! Add as many photos to every country you went too, pin places you've been to in that country and you can even specify which city you went to and also add photos and pins to that specific city!

The developers are very responsive and has good communication when I had problems. They never leave it unresolved!

This app has gotten better with the updates since I started using it back and 2021! Love love love this app! I can't wait to see what it has to offer this year! 
Loving the new Valentines heart pin, btw ü©∑ | This is a great way to document your travels. I have been using this app for almost a year and it is my go to travel app. I document all my trips on the app, add tons of pictures and now it even has a route map which is very cool. The two developers are always working on new ideas and are very receptive to suggestions. You can even go back in and put in past trips and countries you have visited. Can‚Äôt say enough for this app!! | This program supercharges the old concept of putting pins in a map. The zoom in zoom out feature on the world maps gives a fantastic ability to see an overview or detail of places visited. The number of countries visited or the percentage of countries in the world visited allows a clear picture of how far your travels have taken you. Truly outstanding for a visualization of your travel history. | I have wanted and easy way to keep track of all the places I have been and this is sooooo it! I searched through so many apps like it but they were all way too complicated and not as easy to use as pin traveler! Totally recommend for any traveler. The only thing that I don‚Äôt like is that premium is expensive. I would totally get it because I love the app but I‚Äôm a broke student traveler who is spending all my money on new trips soooo I can‚Äôt spend the money but maybe one day! Love this app though! Totally recommend! | Best travel destination tracking app ever. | Premium kinda dumb, too expensive but nothing is that much better, it is worth it for the memories | The first explore I got for a place had as #1 a restaurant across a river from the neighborhood I chose. It also listed a place that has been closed for three years. | Une superbe application pour suivre nos voyages et se rappeler des chemins parcourus ! | Such a user friendly way to keep all your travel locations (and possibly memories) in one place. Every time I open the app I get a big picture of where I want to go next. | You will be limited to 50 pins if you don‚Äôt pay for some version. | Was so great until they put all of the features that used to be free behind a pay wall. You barely get any access without paying $25/year. Don‚Äôt download it. | Gives you a max of 50 pins then wants money. Really? $2.99 a week??  Other options and all over priced. Deleting after posting review | I am a frequent International traveler. Pin traveler has been a joy to use to keep track of countries and cities I have visited. 

I recently had to resolve a question about my subscription and the guys at Pin Traveler were a pleasure to deal with, very quick responses, and everything was straightened out immediately. 

Great app with excellent customer service. I highly recommend it to anyone who travels and would like to easily keep a log of their journeys. | I like it, it works as advertised
I really use it just for the pin feature to see almost the exact places I‚Äôve been but it‚Äôs pretty cool üëç | I‚Äôm addicted to this app. It‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for to document my travels! This app would be perfect if you could list the places costed such as restaurants etc like you can fit the cities costed instead of having to tap into a city pin. | By far the best ""places traveled"" app. I use it very simply (just pin places I've been and then wishlist places I want to go to) but it's perfect and elegant and doesn't pressure you too spend money. And the nifty extra features are very cool. Thank you for making this!!! | 50 free pins, then $40 to continue. Would have been nice to know in the beginning. Delete. | Finally after years of looking for a travel diary, and over 10 travel diary apps downloaded and removed, I finally found what I‚Äôm looking for. This has everything I have searched for, all the features I looked for, finally found in this one app. This app should be renamed ‚ÄúPin Travel Journal Diary. For years I would search apps with search keywords ‚Äútravel diary‚Äù or ‚Äútravel Journal‚Äù in the apple App Store and unfortunately this app never popped up. I believe its due to the keyword ‚Äúpin‚Äù. This app is amazing! It has the capability of so much! These features include, jotting down your travel experiences like you would in a travel journey, you adding photos, Pinning locations on world map, display country flags that you visited, notates the number of places visited, provides a wishlist of places you want to visit, there is so much more! The one thing that I believe this app should try to include in the future is the ability to create a photo book. This would be another benefit or option to be available for users. I love this app. Thank you developers! | Only allows 50 destinations for free version.. pretend users to pay iver $20/year for full service | I found this app a couple of years ago and I love it! It is such a great way to keep track of all our travels around the world. | Can‚Äôt type in national parks or smaller towns. Only allows pins of major cities. Rather useless. | I use this to document each new city that I send an order to with my business. I love keeping track on how far my designs have reached around the world. Thank you!! üß° | Limiting free users to only 50 destinations is a waste of my time. | They want annual subscription for you to map more than 50 pins.   Very disappointed. | Don‚Äôt appreciate being told about about costs associated with this app after you register into an account | This app is good but they can improve you should be able to type In a address.and you should be able to put pictures on the address 
For free. | I have a job role that allows me to travel, plus I have always liked to get out and see the world. Using Pin Traveler is a great way to keep track, I would recommend it to anyone. | I like the app and especially the potential of the app as they make improvements. Using this as our trip journal. Can just click on a stay and see note Anne‚Äôs photos related specifically to that stay. You can also just see your total status across many trips. Very responsive to my email. | Been looking for an app like this for years. Really happy to have found it. Great place to memorialize trips and to add places to visit in the future.  Support was really helpful too. Love this app!!! | This is such a great app but it‚Äôs very confusing to use in order to get stats on your various trips. | Limits you to 50 places then tries to rip you off for their subscription nonsense what a scam | While I‚Äôll go for in app purchases but when the download immediately demands purchase without providing any service I call it a scam. | I‚Äôm rating it low because I paid for the premium and no matter how many times I‚Äôve emailed I‚Äôm still asked to sign up for it. It keeps giving me the free version. | Just started using it but I love it! Will recommend it to others! | The free version limits you to 50 pins. I‚Äôve been to more than 50 places in the past three years. Too expensive to log all my places. I‚Äôm out. | Very nice app for travelers | I like the idea but‚Ä¶You only get 50 pins for free before you have to pay a premium price for more pins. I bet I can use 50 pins before I even reach 100 miles of my home town. I don‚Äôt want or even need all the extra features. I just want to be able to record a new city I visit so I can look back on my travels. Silly that they think I will pay that much for pins. Why not have unlimited pins and pay for the extra features.

I will be deleting right after this review is posted. 

Only way for me to return is free unlimited pins.",4.73292,3456,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f5/2b/64/f52b64fd-e609-e5a4-0fca-ed59ec33d38f/1d9cf7a3-3010-4d2c-98b7-7969576740c5_5.5-Playstore-01_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7c/bf/44/7cbf4402-f639-e80c-3a98-51bc9352f451/362737f4-a350-48c1-9713-e2834a9c838f_5.5-Playstore-02_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/8c/a3/9e/8ca39eee-9880-78c1-e5b6-9903dcd72b9c/dcfbb910-f1a9-40b7-a64c-654737bbcdfa_5.5-Playstore-03_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d0/72/31/d072314a-d416-c74c-f2eb-57d32aa08a02/c2b8b693-ea92-4fb5-b714-a1bffa104c9d_5.5-Playstore-04_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/75/e5/8d/75e58d6d-5c13-7942-a387-25e851e3702e/93272ad1-01bb-4367-96c6-36c4db36570b_5.5-Playstore-05_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/23/f7/a4/23f7a4e5-5788-0455-97f0-c592ed10908e/beda53fe-333c-4193-9e05-ed9673b0c2bb_5.5-Playstore-06_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/70/c3/25/70c325af-7784-e99d-7ba8-bad3c9148d5a/4ca9fb84-b260-4493-b2eb-caebd5bf6b6b_5.5-Playstore-07_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/bd/ce/82/bdce824f-c734-a5f2-bb57-30de1497446e/1b341546-2f11-499a-8dc5-d43f219ef9cc_5.5-Playstore-08_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7f/c0/71/7fc07111-3ec0-4aed-efbd-cb0afe3a2900/83864b9f-a2a3-4a5d-97ee-b43ca0d0e049_5.5-Playstore-09_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d9/1e/68/d91e68b3-d13d-8302-975c-93dec846c7f2/c98b1b22-c245-4c05-a48f-ca7e7e15c91e_5.5-Playstore-10_Blue.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/86/8a/08/868a08bf-61fa-3173-9ee0-39a644145c52/0701a7c9-643c-4e44-8dfb-5d1c4732ca36_TabletDikey_01_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6f/bb/1a/6fbb1a6d-8c49-d3ba-e057-e69879dc0655/57454b56-3fbd-407d-9b3d-ff45fc713b3f_TabletDikey_02_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6a/23/96/6a2396c5-29db-18f5-a16d-4480617a4821/715a0eb5-3284-46e0-bc9d-6dc5865f2d74_TabletDikey_03_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/82/8d/d7/828dd748-7dcb-ec3e-11f8-5e137bfa75f1/37fbb205-ce16-4ebd-8ef7-98c08daed0f4_TabletDikey_04_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/2c/8e/ff/2c8eff80-30e8-9d2b-e721-955b09dab324/d4f2f68d-b6d9-40d9-a695-d2edd1c4a490_TabletDikey_05_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/62/d9/7a/62d97aa0-d70c-198c-603a-2ca816331bdc/db91d08a-1964-4531-bf1f-e74dc0055f16_TabletDikey_06_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e1/d9/a4/e1d9a4f0-9877-ce6d-30c1-8a43c01873f2/32a2c5c2-c8cd-4cbc-bfee-401ee34c23a7_TabletDikey_07_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/92/1d/6a/921d6a65-b79f-225f-0dfe-52b31f8ef05e/144e9e5d-b1eb-4a1c-9161-2ec4beeea4ba_TabletDikey_08_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9b/b5/a3/9bb5a318-92c1-64db-e461-40d5ab5acf4a/68fa7799-615a-4a79-acaa-2006b4561b1e_TabletDikey_09_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/61/0a/ec/610aeca7-a363-ada0-1945-ee2e4b447017/2eeef9d1-d5da-4b1a-950b-307112f58e26_TabletDikey_10_Blue.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMa

3-29-2024‚Ä¶ AM | V√≠ctor was really nice and gave out good information during my ride. I really recommend this person. | We enjoyed our conversation about the island, traffic, pizza, and local bakeries. | Traveled 24 hrs & took forever for Uber app to work. Was happening to everyone. Just frustrating. Worked eventually. Awesome driver!! | Uber uses the local yellow taxis. It‚Äôs a great collaboration. Works like the regular Uber service | I had a driver not pick me up and still charge me when I booked prior to a surge

Had to wait for him to finish the ride before I could book again, and I had to pay for a more expensive second ride. Have had a back and forth with customer security and they genuinely seem unable to understand the situation. They seem poorly trained, and haven‚Äôt helped me at all | I‚Äôll drive was exactly on time as posted by the app. He was helpful with our luggage. He was incredibly polite and everything went well and we are back home safe and sound bravo. | Placed an order with wingstop thru Uber Eats and got a call from the driver telling me that Wingstop wasn‚Äôt making any food due to their drivers being down. I contacted Uber via the app and was told the issue was outside the area of expertise and that I‚Äôd be transferred to a specialist.  Once transferred I received a message that they‚Äôll do their best to respond within 6-12 hours. I‚Äôm hungry NOW.  So I still couldn‚Äôt cancel the order. 

I then called wingstop and asked for a refund, the girl in the other end of the line informed me that a refund will take 6-8 days to reach my account! Why, they took the money instantly as soon as the order was placed I should receive an immediate refund. So screw Uber Eats and screw wingstop | Don‚Äôt know what happened, but we waited almost 30‚Äù at the airport, not driver fault. Roger is a nice guy, we like him! | Best NASCAR driver ever got to ride with! | He  went above and beyond to help me out and was very kind. Definitely one of the best drivers I‚Äôve had. | Junior has amazing customer service!! | Your awesome thanks again! | I will be writing a alert for ever fraud indication I had so get ready. This app is unreliable and will sell your information and you won‚Äôt realize it at first until your bank detects fraud. Uber should be ashamed of themselves, they are an absolute disgrace to any normal person | Thank you Sal ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è | Driver was amazing, great greeting, conversation and customer service. Thank you | Thank you | He was prompt and polite.  Highly recommend! | Very nice person!! | That is it enjoyed ride | Chainsaw Charles was the man. A blessing. | Very professional and kind. Excellent. | Hello, my name is Melanie and I just wanted to make a review on this app‚Ä¶ before today I loved the app ‚ÄúUber‚Äù so much I would order 2-3 Ubers a day every week day to school for my 3 semesters (year and a half)and even to places I would even use Uber eats it was amazing‚Ä¶ until today Thursday march 28th, my Uber driver took advantage of me. 
Before I got in my Uber I saw my package so I nicely asked my driver (Maryam) if I could have a second to put my package inside before I leave since there‚Äôs many dogs by my street, so she said yes I thought she was being nice until as soon as I got to my school I noticed my AirPods were GONE, I use my AirPods 24/7 to study in college and I got scared so first thing I did was check findmy and I saw my AirPods location and saw that she had them, I thought it was an accident maybe she just hasn‚Äôt seen them yet ? No. I was wrong she did knew about them actually she took them as soon as I left to get my package at my house she STOLE from me. I contacted the Uber app and all they said was ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt do anything about it call your local police station ‚Äú I have never felt so mad before. I went to 2  different police stations all the said was that Uber has to to the job not them‚Ä¶ the Uber driver (Maryam) hung up on me many times and blocked my number. UBER how could you still let them work for you!!! This is insane what if I was not the first client she has ever did this to ? What if there‚Äôs more people she robbed or if in a future she tries to do it again‚Ä¶ she needs to get fired for what she did. Plus as an extra she passes over the street limit with her white Tesla. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è horrible. | absolutely fantastic | Highly Recommended. | Spent over 4 hours on support calls over three incorrect orders in a row. They refused to refund the incorrect items, refused to transfer to a supervisor, lied to me multiple times, and then hung up on me so they could keep their number of completed tickets per hour up. Avoid this app and company at all costs. | We were waiting for the Uber driver and we were at the location by the flyover and the driver was nowhere to be found 
We texted him and told him our location at that time he cancelled our ride and we still had to pay a cancellation fee when it was the driver that cancelled. 
This is poor customer service and I would like my money refunded due to your drivers negligence | All went well. | Enjoyed the ride and conversation. Very safe driver | The best Uber driver! He gave  us a tour of NOLA! | I recently joined a family account and my family member had payed for one of my ubers. the day after that i wanted to order an uber to get to work but I wanted to pay for it myself this time and it wouldn‚Äôt let me pay it would say ‚Äúcan only use family payment method‚Äù I logged out the family account and i added my own card it still didn‚Äôt let me pay an uber i was crying as i had to clock in for work late since i had to walk it. i found out that i can only use my family‚Äôs card because of this promotion uber added where i get 40% off but can only use with family payment method and i can‚Äôt take off this promotion so i‚Äôm stuck without getting and uber and i have been getting lyft lately honestly way better I wanted to write this so people could see my frustration | Excellent service provided by Faith during our Uber ride.  She was on time at the pick up location and her overall service was outstanding. | Excellent service !!!! Thank you. üòä | The driver was very patient connecting with me to get the pick up location when there was confusion on where the best place to meet was.  I appreciate his understanding and sticking with me until we got everyone in the same location. | Promis is a wonderful driver! And a wonderful person! | Thank you for a great smooth safe and peaceful ride home today after a bad commute home. | Friendly | Hunter was the best driver | My mother ordered an uber and it never came. They charged her account and then asked if she wanted to TIP?? How could you have the gall to ask for a tip too? This is pathetic and this is theft. I suggest not using unless you really need to because there is a chance you will lose your money because there is no customer service. Absolutely NONE. I tried calling, emailing, everything. My mother tried as well. They did not even try to reimburse my mother. They will not give you your money back. | Clarence was greatüëç
Gave him a cash tipüëç | Ronald was great definitely 5 stars. Highly recommend him. | First driver cancelled on me. | Angel was an ideal driver. She was prompt, her car was meticulously cleaned. She was a careful and attentive driver and a gracious conversationalist. A wonderful experience. | What a nice gentleman giving me a ride. Very safe driver, clean car. Thank you! | Rick was awesome so friendly and was willing to wait a a couple minutes without any fuss or attitude
He car was exceptional and a great driver  as well | Norman was so inviting from beginning. He interacted with me and talked with me the whole ride. He was my therapist! Lol Thank you Norman you‚Äôre the best! | When ordering a store pickup from Uber package, the app opens to a menu where you have to select a method to verify your identity, but the screen just freezes and you can‚Äôt place your order. Horrible, had to use Lyft to pick up my order, never trusting Uber again. | A wonderful ride.

Very Impressive! I will be flying delta all the way and will recommend many to do so. | I never understand why I don‚Äôt get miles. Just paid double and no miles? | Completely embarrassing app experience. Constant crashes and errors. Do better. | The app will allow me to check in but won‚Äôt let me add a bag or upgrade my seat. | Good food
Quiet
Comfortable 
Flight attendant was just right! | The app was very slow. I got an oops messages 3 times. I think it‚Äôs fine now but not sure. About to go through security. | Very unhappy got to the Seattle airport with over a hour and half to spare. Baggage check was such a joke made the 7 min tsa pre check and missed my flight. Then got to the line where i thought id be helped and pretty much got told your in the wrong line I can‚Äôt help you. At a bag drop line because they wanted me to use the kiosk. | The app is really great with one major flaw. You should be able to disable the auto brightness which is just way too much. If anything put something on the app to say you might need to brighten your screen for the reader, blah blah blah, but don't make everything bright by default because sometimes you want to check your stuff without being blinded! | With the wrong info given and being a 8 year customer they made me love a staus I held for 5 years because of rushed sky miles update and had nothing they could do to help and no care for the loyalty I‚Äôve shown the company | Would not let me acknowledge check in without re-purchasing seats. I went through that initially. | Delta is always great to fly on. They take good care of me. | The two things you care about most during travel: how to get between gates and when does boarding begin, are very poorly implemented with this app.   The others give you step by step directions using a detailed airport map and the home page gives you a count down to the boarding time, after updating even before your inbound flight is at the gate. | Had a connecting flight, to Portland Me 
They closed the gates early and I think they gave away our seats. Sad they know we are on another flight don‚Äôt wait for us to board. | Our flight left early so  we missed it our connection. We were rerouted to another airport and not given credit or upgraded even though our destination was 2 hours away from original destination. We were not upgraded or credited compensation | The layout is easy to read! | Easy to use app | Delta always goes the extra mile to provide excellent customer service to its customers!

I love flying with Delta | Worst experience ever,first time flying with delta and worst experience ever | Michael Jenkins, trying to be antagonizing with the police officers about me | Delta.com does not work on Safari. Google it and so many people have the same problem. Its been like this for a long time now and no fix. I have to use different browsers. Unbelievable a company can‚Äôt work on the most popular browser on iPhones and does nothing about it.

Also, what is up with the fake reviews for this app?  The top reviews are super negative and then will show 5 stars on the individual‚Äôs review?  

Apple, do something about this fraud. | The keyboard on my phone overlaps the field to enter the confirmation number, it makes it difficult to see what is being typed | Delta has stripped away all of the reasons for having a brand loyalty medal
After 29 years of loyalty I can‚Äôt select a seat 
Delta is no better than Spirit | I have constantly experienced total App failure over the last 18 months: ‚ÄúPlease Try Again Later‚Äù | I tried upgrading my flight last night and there were so many steps I apparently missed one even though the last one I selected was ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù. So this morning it was 4x as much to make the upgrade and delta wouldn‚Äôt honor the previous price. | I have had incredible service flying on Delta services always been so wonderful the food could improve. I wish sometimes they would stick to the basics in first class and even in premium- people must remember that they were people from all over the world flying, and to start making things that just don‚Äôt make sense people would be happy with a croissant, a piece of fruit and a muffin for breakfast. They don‚Äôt need to get an omelette with all kinds of weird stuff , people want basic pancakes, basic regular French toast, not French toast on a baguette that looks like a cracker. The food really needs to step up - just keep
it simple , less sauces , just pure ingredients . | Its 4:37 am and I returned my tental car and showed my boarding passes at security, but of course nonidy is at the gate yet. I still have my large duitcase, which is free for me to check, but there has been no sign to direct me to the desk where I check in, so I still have my suitcase. Help, Delta!!!! | It will lock up and update on you when you need to most. Always print a copy of your ticket if possible, at the very least anytime it is up go ahead and take a picture of it so that you can get on board the aircraft. Delta has the best employees but the worst app. | Very user friendly and easy to navigate! | Quite fast and easy use | The app takes forever to refresh my trips, and my current strips are not available until I do the refresh. I really do not like using this app at all. | Please fix your app. Used to be able to export flight to calendar. It‚Äôs still an option on the app but is no longer appears as an option in security settings, making it impossible to add flight info to the calendar. | In checking in I was asked to pay for checked bags that I already paid for. I guess I‚Äôll deal with it at the airport. | Great service | I brought my 9year old grandson as my companion for a trip to Florida. Twice Delta decided to change our seats so we aren‚Äôt next to one another!! He‚Äôs 9!! And they wouldn‚Äôt allow me to change the seats so we could be together at the gate. They‚Äôre evil. | I picked aisle seat it automatically changed to middle seat which is not fair lady traveling alone. | I love flying Delta | The app is decent, but utterly fails for international flights and sometimes forgets flights altogether | Way too many adds and upsells.  Very frequent traveler but won‚Äôt use app. | Very difficult process | Pagu√© por el equipaje y no me sale la confirmaci√≥n de pagado pero si el d√©bito en mi cuenta | Please add a MQD tracker widget to the App so we can see our MQDs without having to login to the Fly Delta App. | I get the circle of death in the app every time I try to bring up my boarding pass as I work my way through the airport. TSA, gate, etc. actual boarding pass delays in being brought up. | I think the justification as to why we need to see an agent for check in would be helpful for an international flight if you are unable to check in via the app.

We had concerns around whether or not we would be able to get on to the flight but the agent once we arrived mentioned to us they just need to check the physical document. | Our delta flight out of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic was delayed which in turn made us miss our connecting flight home. Delta did nothing to alleviate any stress put on us due to this. I am now out of pocket hundreds of dollars due to having to find a hotel room in the middle of the night. The offer for a discounted room is a joke. $20 off is nothing. We will NEVER fly delta again | To look up your flight, you need your confirmation number.  Who knows that.  If I am logged in, it should be available. | Checked me in before I was able to update my passenger details. I was only looking at the passenger details and UPDATING them so when I check in my tsa-pre is there. I‚Äôve yet to see if it will add it after the fact. It is travel through work so I didn‚Äôt book on the delta site‚Ä¶usually they give you a hard time about tsa-pre if you use a third party site. Smh‚Ä¶annoyed. | Ridiculous | Delta is getting worse and worse on pricing its seats by space availability and the space offerings hardly leaves room for even a small carry-on.  All airlines are creating greater classes of service with none of the benefits accruing to the passenger.  Domestic flying is lousy at almost every class of ticket. | Mostly useless and clunky.

UI is not clear. I booked hotel and flight twice with same day same time!!

customer service chat is old fashioned style. 

I have to open chat window with each section. 

their was not organized.

please keep in mind, do not book through the app. Don‚Äôt be mess your vacation. | Love the deals and discounts you all find | Fast & accurate! | booked a stay for my wife, baby and a family friend. arrived at our place and couldn‚Äôt get a hold of the host, but proceeded to follow the check in instructions. keys were missing from the property so i called the host. they picked up after a few rings and hung up. i called back 10 times with no response. called agora customer support which after an hour (and at this point a screaming baby) offered to cancel my reservation. 20 business days on the refund. thanks agoda!

i ended booking a place that was 50% more expensive out of desperation.

to add insult to injury, i wrote back later insisting on writing a negative review for the property that same day no showed me, since they were a 9/10 listing.

they informed me that only people with a successfully completed stay can write reviews‚Ä¶welp i guess i don‚Äôt qualify. | I use this site to book a flight and after the flight was confirmed and paid for. I later received an email saying that there were changes to my flight with the booking confirmation number. However, I later tried to make changes in my return flight, the airlines told me to go to the travel agency which I did so but there's no bookings ID number, there is no customer service phone number, their online chat doesn't help and no one will not reply to the many emails that were sent. So after you book your flight, you are on your own!!! | They scam using cheap dirty motels they don‚Äôt check the the authenticity of the places they listed they are a 3rd party company so when you book thru them and something happens they have to talk to another company to talk to the hotel. I paid 143 to stay somewhere blood used tampons black mold in the room(even sent pics) ended up sleeping in my car for the 2 nights and now I‚Äôm getting the runaround from not only Agoda but the booking partner which they won‚Äôt disclose to you for a refund they only offered me 42 dollars worth of credits which isn‚Äôt nowhere near enough to book one night yet alone 2. DO NOT USE THIS SITE THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF CURRENTLY IN CONTACT WITH ALL MAJOR NEWS NETWORKS TO EXPOSE THEM FOR THE FRAUDS THEY REALLY ARE | Great | Very difficult to get the price shown that I wanted. Keep having trouble until the price raised. | They keep flagging me for fraud and when I provide photos of my card and ID with matching names, they still cancelled my booking on 3 occasions to where I had to use Expedia instead or I would have had no place to rest after driving for 15 hours. Huge disappointment with this company and their help chat is useless. I tried to call someone as well, but they couldn‚Äôt put me through to fraud prevention so there was no one to explain anything to me or give me a reason why I keep getting flagged. Never using them again for a booking. | Thank you for simplifying the reservation from USA and my visit.  My father passed away and we are here for a burial. | Hope it‚Äôs improved.  Used it many years ago and Siam Kempinski gave us what was the worst room in the hotel: run-down, dirty, crammed with broken furniture.  

Giving Agoda another chance today for Sapporo in late April.  Hope it is not a repeat of the previous bad experience. | Be careful. Agora quotes price lower than it charges. Deceptive and dishonest | This app  is really good | These people are ridiculous. They down right refused to tell me what all the taxes were for. Told me I had to book the room first before they could discuss that. I said what I'd I don't want to pay for those taxes and I don't want the room after I book it as you tell me what the taxes are. She just kept repeating herself. Refused to get a manager, refused to give me someone else. I'm so frustrated. It was like beating a dead horse talking to her. | Add kitchenette as a search option or family room | Was able to cancel one reservation but the second cancellation was ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù and frozen for a week so I had to cancel with the hotel directly, thus rendering this app utterly worthless. | Â¶ÇÊûú‰ªñËßâÂæó‰Ω†ËÆ¢ÁöÑÈÖíÂ∫ó‰ª∑Ê†º‰Ωé‰∫ÜÔºå‰ªñÂèØ‰ª•Áõ¥Êé•ÂçïÊñπÈù¢ËøùÁ∫¶ÂèñÊ∂à‰Ω†ÁöÑËÆ¢Âçï„ÄÇËøòÂö£Âº†ÁöÑÂëäËØâ‰Ω†ÂÖçË¥πÁªô‰Ω†ÂèñÊ∂à‰∫ÜÔºåÊàë‰ª¨Âæà‰ªÅÊÖàÔºÅ‰Ω†Ë¶ÅÁõ∏‰ø°Êñ∞Âä†Âù°ÁöÑ‰ªª‰Ωï‰∏úË•øÔºå‰ªñ‰ª¨ÈÉΩÊòØÈ™óÂ≠ê | This app offer cheaper prices than others! | You will not be able to book anymore.

This is very dubious and also the app is very glitchy and shakes when trying to book.  
I recommend NOT using this app at all but use trivago and if prices are lower on Agoda then just use their website. | Prices change when you clpick to select üëéüèΩ | Love it! Easy, got it done, thanks again! Made my trip hassle free | Canceled my reservation 3 days before the trip and like all app based businesses Agoda doesn't feel the need to have a strong customer service support system. They said they sent an email confirming a reservation and when that confirmation went un noticed they canceled without an opportunity to get the reservation back. I now have plane tickets, baseball tickets and reservations without anywhere to stay. Will never use them again. | By agoda Booking of Agra , India the worst experience. By agoda its showing total different then Really. By booking its shown Deluxe room with 1 double bed +single bed. @ hotel staff say  there no any that type room in whole premises. May be website mistake they say. No cleanliness. Why agoda not confirm 1st the premissesüòÇüòÇüòÇ | Fees and taxes should be displayed in the search. | I have used short term rental apps for many years without a hitch. For the first time ever I rented a place that was not suitable ( no electricity, no heat, no hot water!). I needed a place right away and agoda came to the rescue! I was able to rent a room at a nearby hotel at a decent price in less than 1 hr. I am still not at the hotel, but so far, so good. Thanks! | Booking through Agoda by far the best experience and deals.. I have been using Agoda through my international travel bookings on hotels and best deals around. I will be booking this site again for future travels and hotel bookings.. | So far it beats Priceline on the cost will see how it works | I booked 4 nights of stay for my dad, but he ended up staying for 2 nights because had family emergency in ilocos his hometown. He had to traveled back to ilocos after his 2 nights of stayed. I reached out with the hotel manager through email and I was told ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt do anything about it‚Äù all I was asking is IF HE CAN USE THE OTHER 2 nights for the following week. And still the manager says he can‚Äôt make decision and I have to call and reach out with the site where I made the reservation. Why make it so difficult????it was just only a small favor.

There is no refunds and no one to help you with customer service. They only contact you when you leave a bad review. I would recommend using another service as they will not be there in case you get into trouble. | Don‚Äôt get app it‚Äôs a scam | I‚Äôve had a ludicrous amount of trouble applying the credit Agoda gave me for defrauding me on an earlier cancelled booking.

Overall the delta app is more robust and I think American would be well served to check the competition for their offering. As of now, the AA app is just okay. I‚Äôd like to have all of the info at my fingertips. | My husband uses wheelchair assist -we were delivered to the remote downstairs gate in plenty of time. 
Then there was an announce gate change from L19 to H2- with 29 minutes to boarding and no gate agents in sight -so we walked very slowly and got there but it was not easy for him. | Flew with American twice and got screwed over twice. I tried to give them a second chance but literally last minute flight delayed which made me miss my trip. I could not fly out a day later so I had to pay extra with a different airline to make my trip the same day. I would have saved money if i flew with the airline I booked to save my trip early as opposed to American Airlines. They delayed the flight about 1.5 hours before departure and it was delayed by 3 hours so I couldn‚Äôt make my connecting flight. The first scenario with American was the flight was also delayed taking off and so I missed my connecting flight home and had to spend the night at the airport. They didn‚Äôt offer a hotel because of weather conditions but it was perfectly fine outside. Anyways, I‚Äôm more comfortable paying extra for security and safety with Delta or United as opposed to American because they‚Äôre too volatile and unpredictable. Not mad just disappointed in them. | Very bad design decisions all around. Weird bottom drawer navigation that‚Äôs inconsistent between pages makes it very difficult to gain an intuitive sense on where to go/what to do in the app. Inability to see trips after signing (instead you have to input a confirmation code) is frustrating and unnecessary.  Generally seems like little thought was put into user journeys and there was little empathy for what a users experience would actually be like. | I just missed my connecting flight in Charlotte and I'm very angry! The plane from Miami was late and they told us to run to the connecting flight to Buffalo. As we did that, they closed the doors on us! I got there first. There are a lot of angry people here, myself included. The pilot was looking at us from the plane and just smiling. He opened the door to talk to one of the American Airlines attendants, then looked at us passengers and closed the door again. The flight attendant came back to tell us that the pilot decided not to let us in. This is so unprofessional. Such horrible service. Never ever fly American. | Nobody should EVER be in the position to have outdated information displayed on the app. 

When opening the app, all flights should automatically refresh. 

Whenever any part of the app is refreshed (pull down, etc.), ALL parts should be refreshed. 

There should never be an instance where the app says ""last updated 12 days, 7 hours, 13 minutes ago"". 

This isn't ""social media"" or ""news"". 
Flight information is often time-critical and needs to be accurate at all times. | The worst service ever for wheelchair assistance! | First flight, Great and all Staff friendly!
Second connecting flight, all Staff sooooo rude!   
And the WiFi never worked!!! | Deberian permitir hasta 3 maletas en equipaje de bodega, me parece muy poco 2 cuando uno hace un viaje costoso | Updating personal information through the app for notifications or personal data never ‚Äústicks‚Äù. Submit and save is a joke. | I‚Äôm so glad to fly American Airlines.I enjoyed talking with the team and there care for all of us aboard. Captain continued to keep us updated thru out the flight. Would Fly anyone else. | Single nonstop direct flight. Lost my bag??? | if you compare AA‚Äôs app to delta, united, air canada it is starting to feel outdated and needs a refresh to modernize functionality, look and feel and performance with more native controls vs embedded web UI | Make it easier to provide Member ID and TSA PRE number for flights. Not very helpful for this to be buried in trip management. | TJ and Charles on flight CLE to LGA were great | The reason I try to ONLY fly American is because of great people like Lenea & Trina (not sure if I spelled their names right) our flight attendants. Thank you American for hiring people like them along with our pilot Scott! Thank you!!! Flight from Houston on 3-24-2024 flight # 4916. | We were told flight was canceled due to weather while they were dispatching another flight with the same route 2 hours prior‚Ä¶ | I used app to be placed on same day standby. Up until boarding time I was in standby list, then suddenly my name AND original flight reservation disappeared. Customer service informed me agent error caused them to use my reservation to board someone else on standby in earlier flight. I was re booked, but lost my premium seat and now had to do a connection flight. | Kept asking for review while I was trying to use the app, every time I opened it. Bad job. You get one star. | This app is incomplete, it is not as informative as apps for other airlines, United, for example. The American app lacks lots of information, such as seat map aides available so you can see his full the plane is, or if you get your row filled , etc. Knowing if your plane is en route, before they announce a delay, is helpful, United shows you all that, even a flight map, American app needs lots of work! Of course, if you are flying American you have no choice but to use it!! | I haven‚Äôt flown American Airlines in over 20 years, now I know why! Dysfunctional at best. Plane delays, last-minute gate changes, there were even no drinks available on the way home, unless you‚Äôd like some room temperature water. On one part of our flight, we upgraded to first class from Detroit to North Carolina, not real sure why, there was really nothing different than flying economy, other than you had a little more legroom. Wasn‚Äôt worth the upgrade. I would say the worst part of all, were the last-minute gate changes, without any notice. It caused us 45 minutes of rushed walking/running through very busy, huge airport. I had my sister with me, who is dealing with cancer, and gets exhausted, easily. It was just too much for her. We cannot afford to fly with American Airlines ever again. Next time we need to fly with a more organized airline. I almost feel like I need another vacation from the chaotic stress! | The flight search feature is just not working lately!  My app is all updated but it‚Äôs still not working.  Please fix! | It‚Äôs very hard to find boarding times on this app. It doesn‚Äôt show up on the boarding pass and neither does the terminal. It‚Äôs also hard to update your number for notifications. Screen doesn‚Äôt work. | I am still working to be compensated from a delayed bag less than a week ago and now it has happend again. Bag could also not be delivered to where i was at. | I‚Äôve traveled a lot I own property in the States & abroad, I have say I read a complaint towards us, the passenger/customers from KLXA380 ü§îI have to say I agree 100% we often treat the agents as though they are to blame for the delays, I‚Äôve watched them being disrespected as they remain politely trying to help & also seen some act as though they own the Airport & Airline. However most of my experience has been excellent, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I am grateful every day I am able to return home üè° to my babies and my dogs. If we stop & think they often delay flights üßêfor our own safety. I was actually a bit surprised the last time I flew in to BDL it snowed & my flight came through Chicago, I saw how they were dicing the plane and I have to say I was impressed & again grateful because a lot of flights were cancelled & in Miami the agent got me on a flight home üè° God bless that beautiful angel üòá ü•∞and all the TSA agents too, I will tell you I get a little nervous when I fly and I‚Äôve forgotten a thing or 2, a few times & they usually call me back for it. I really think they go above and beyond ant please remember they are also every day people just like us & they also go through stressful situations just like us. Do please treat them with more kindness & compassion, Thank you ü™∑‚úàÔ∏èüíû | This is really bad, poor management all around. When we got in line at 2:00. We‚Äôd already missed all the flights leaving for our destination. The line was backed up to the restrooms pass D40. We have employees just talking and laughing and not helping at all. I‚Äôm so surprised a riot hasn‚Äôt happened. We booked with Sandals so we are unable to rebook on the app. | You‚Äôre telling me that American Airlines let United airlines beat them to live activities support.  Pretty weak. Get in the game and support what people want. Also, get back to being a first class airline and not a budget airline. | I have to sleep on the floor tonight  I‚Äôm 65 years old with arthritis  on my spine, so what do you think üò°üò¢ | There is no place to input the TSAPre number‚Ä¶ this is a big nuisance!!! | Just because I have an iPhone doesn‚Äôt mean I use Apple Wallet.

Give me an option to email or screenshot the boarding pass.

Don‚Äôt be stupid. | Fairly good app, but need a page or tab for Parking Reminder (notes and pic) | Complete waste of time ! | I know now why they have five stars in the App Store people are using it to get there complaints to the front of the line. How this airline is still in business is beyond me. American Airlines doesn‚Äôt care about their customers. They will nickel and dime you and leave you never wanting to use their service. No reason why no one wants to work for them. | It‚Äôs 1:37 am 3/22/24 and my bags were unloaded at 00:25 & 00:26 respectively and I have not received my bags or an explanation from airline personnel as to why it‚Äôs taking so long. Unbelievable!!!! They tell you you‚Äôre the reason they fly interesting. | First time flyer turned into a frequent flyer.  Flight attendants were very polite and attentive.  I was so anxious for my first flight and couldn‚Äôt be happier with my experience. | I keep receiving the same error login cancelled | American airline is very bad like really bad service I booked a flight and I couldn‚Äôt go on that flight because I need to get a surgery done and I talked with the American airline costumer service and they said they will refund me my money and told me to cancel and they also asked for my personal letter that I got from my doctor regarding my surgery which was very personal and I gave it to them and in the end they said they won‚Äôt give me any money I had paid 335 dollars which was a big amount for me and there‚Äôs like 4 months till that flight and I can‚Äôt get the flight or the money at this point. When I traveled last night the air host was also very bad my luggage was very so I asked them for help but they said they are not gonna help I have to do it my self because they are not assisted to cover those jobs. Please don‚Äôt ever book from American Airline this is literally like me donating money to these airlines I can‚Äôt people these people now a day they are like just tryna make money out from some innocent people like us | Love the bag tracking feature as well as all the real time notifications regarding gate changes, baggage carousel numbers, etc. Very helpful app! | Exceptional customer service is about finding solutions problems not deferring them. American Airlines at the Manchester airport in New Hampshire has a policy somewhere written on their website that states you must be at the airport 45 minutes before your flight in order to check in your luggage. The main reason for flying out of a small airport is that you do not need to be there extra early. My wife and I went to check in our luggage 43 minutes before the flight, and we were greeted by a blank look.  The woman at the desk said I cannot check your bags you are late you should‚Äôve been here 45 minutes. I asked if I could carry the bags on she replied no one bag is too big.  She then said, I will book you for another flight which would‚Äôve taken us into Orlando five hours after our conference started. After 10 minutes, she then said you could try to go through the TSA checkpoint. The agent at the TSA checkpoint found one item in our bag that could not be carried on which was a $30 item which had to be thrown out. When we went to board the plane the agent at the desk said I will check your bags but your one bag will cost $30. I agreed. He then waived the $30. Why even mention the $30 to make matters worse if you‚Äôre going to waive it. Had the original agent not delayed us  I would have removed that item from the bag and place it in my car.  Back to my original comment exceptional customer service is about finding solutions. The original agent could have simply stated it the beginning that we could go through TSA and they would check our bags in at the plane. Then inform us of the policy that you need to be 45 minutes early. | This app is horrible. Booking flight function doesn‚Äôt work. After putting all information in, there keeps being an error on booking page saying country code for phone number is not selected. But the selection box for country code does not work at all. It‚Äôs American. Why can‚Äôt they just default the phone number country code to +1 ??? Or make the app actually work? | All of us hate airlines because they are rude, late, treat their customers like cattle etc etc. just wanted to make a special point to let American Airlines know that after waiting well over an hour ( in the queue) I finally got on with the rudest and most unhelpful agent possible. I know to complain is futile because literally no one in this airline cares at all about what their customers think about their service | App keeps getting better and proving more details for the traveler. | Poo poo | AA now forces you to provide your health information to a 3rd party (Daon) in order to check in and have your boarding pass digitally. If you value health privacy AA‚Äôs new app requirements are not for you. | After reading all the complaints .I decided to not renew my status . I‚Äôve been traveling transatlantic more not on AA  it use to be a very good airline seven years ago but now the miles you can‚Äôt really use I often book business class but even the inflight crew is angry you are flying business The industry has become low class.

Also  the customer about the carry he had for years I agree it‚Äôs ridiculous it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a scam for you to pay to check bags . | Always a great experience from stepping into airport , on to planes and the landing- great service all the time. | Clutterd user interface. Most functions use www of apl. Errors out when trying to update basic personal data. Passport. etc.   Errors out out on basic commands | I was enjoying my flight experience with American Airlines until I arrived home to find out my bag was delayed and still in another state. I have no idea how it could‚Äôve happened because the people I flew with had theirs and we did everything together and watched the people lay them next to each other on belt. I am so disappointed, my valuables are in my bag and who knows if I will get my things. I literally paid to transfer my bag for it to not be transferred with me. I don‚Äôt think I will fly with American Airlines again! | It took more than 2.5 hrs of submitting forms, chatting via the app, and now being transferred to different reps a total of 4 times now.  All I did was put in the wrong month for my birthday when I signed up on the app for Aadvantage and there was no way to quickly update it on the app or website. Instead of bailing these airlines out with our tax money when they fail, we need to let them go and be with the

Never had an issue. | Last time I stayed in Hilton the room was dirty and their was stuff in the fridge, I told the people at the front desk and hey said it was going to be taken care of. Three days went by and nothing was done, i spoke to the manager and she assured me it was going to be taken care of the following days, three days had to go by and i still had the stuff in the fridge which was not mine and I had to take out in my own. I even spoke to customer service numbers and they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything because I was still there. IHG takes care of issues right away and they give you points for the inconvenience. | Simple and easy to understand mobile app. | When traveling I always try to stay at Hilton as my preferred host! Most stays are of very accommodating and friendly service. Looking forward to stay tomorrow at Hilton Pensacola beach! | DeAnna the bartender is amazing! Shes friendly and super quick on her feet!!!  She definitely makes me want to come back! | When you add additional people to reserved rooms, the name CAN NOT have an apostrophe. 
Example: O‚ÄôBrien is not an acceptable name. Nor, is OBrien. You can‚Äôt leave that portion of the app until you substitute an acceptable name. Then, you will need to call the hotel and get them to change the name. 
Poor design. Fix it. 
Otherwise, I have been a frequent user of this app and pleased with its performance. | The app does what it should for me; great. It also send push notification advertisements for cross promoted garbage. No, I do not want ads for your credit cards; that is completely unrelated to what I want from this app. | Hilton does a great job on their app making searching and booking easy. I love the benefits of being a Hilton Honors member. No other credit card has the offers that Hilton does so we use it all the time! We‚Äôll continue being Hilton Honors members and look forward to staying at future Hilton hotels as we travel. | I travel several times throughout the year. While I have free will to stay of my choosing, I tend to always pick Hilton. I have never failed to get a happy smile from the receptionist and every employee throughout my stay. That goes a long way when you have a stressful day of business. | I haven‚Äôt been to HGI this year. I‚Äôve been coming to Orlando once a week but not there due to bad service i received over the phone. But i do miss one of the manager at from desk Steve at HGI Lake Mary so i reserved the room so i can experience his greatness. 

Steve, thank you for all you do, I miss you and can‚Äôt wait to see you again.
. | The Hilton is the only Hotel I consider when traveling. Diamond membership is a must and totally worth it. Whether you‚Äôre on a budget or looking for a Five star stay, I recommend the Hilton. Consistently good and pet friendly, digital key is an added bonus. I love the Hilton. | I have used this app for months and out of nowhere it stopped working. I have reached out to Hilton Customer Support and they said there is no technical support available. They offered no next steps or solutions! | Yes bed bugs in the bed. Absolutely disgusting. They moved me immediately but now I have to freeze all my clothes when I get back to kill them all. Very disappointing as never had this happen at a Hilton. | You cannot get the digital key issued in the app after check through front desk. This would be a problem if a stayed at a Marriott. üòæüòæ | Always great customer service and clean hotels | I wanted to pay for an upgrade and it wouldn‚Äôt allow it | App not working | So easy to use this app and as a Hilton Honors member the app allows me to see all my options, available discounts, and pricing options to use my points. | I hate the fact that the digital key is an automatic when checking in on the app. I don‚Äôt want to have to remember to click ‚Äúoff‚Äù digital key. It should be a choice. | It was very easy to book this‚Ä¶ | I like that the app is easy to use, consistent ratings of rooms, tracks my points and stays for reference, and has not been hard to deal with if questions or changes. | I love staying at Hilton‚Äôs but not all are created equal.  There‚Äôs barely any information about the hotel, the area surrounding it, nearby locations, etc‚Ä¶ and no ratings from customers.  To be informed, I look up hotels on other apps & then book them here.  I expect better from Hilton. | I love the Hilton locations because they are clean, upscale and you can digitally check in without worry! They greet you with waters, often times serve amazing breakfasts, lunches and dinners and even deserts depending on the location!!! | Embassy suites will always be our #1 choice. It‚Äôs the only hotel that can accommodate our our family of 5. We have plenty of room (without having to get two rooms). Embassy suites always has a beautiful ambience, wonderful food and happy hour. With options across the US it‚Äôs always going to be our number one choice. | I checked in on app chose room 206 they put me in 514. Get in and have no air | Great service, very accommodating!  Digital check in is wonderful | So easy | Friends and family discount not working. Hotel management wouldn‚Äôt approve. Having to pay a higher rate than we should with no assistance seems unreasonable | Called help line twice
Make changes on computer does not load in Apple 14 pro . Cancel reservation it remains. Touch My Stay and no guest names or info displayed.  Search hotels and no rates available. 
IT needs to know this has been going on three weeks. Close to Bonvoy move | The app is great, with one small exception. The app will not remember my credit card information, so I am forced to enter the card number every time I book a room.  Since I travel a lot, this is a pain.  Similar apps store the information, so booking is easy.  If they got this fixed, the app would be great. | Stay was good last time | Worst weekend I can remember ! First no room service . On our anniversary (March 16)  we were unaware that there was no room service.  We were dining in our room. Had to get out of bed go down stairs to get a lousy breakfast. The TV screen went black several times during our stay . Technician couldn‚Äôt  get it to reboot. This was our 56  Anniversary.  Could someone help us to relive our Anniversary?  Thanks ,David E Williams | I recently downloaded the app and I was charged $11.99. Why? It states free to

Used to use it all the time. Now will go elsewhere | No matter what region you select, it only returns one result for a paid tour in Japan. No other information, guides, or content present. | This app will help me dream bigger‚Ä¶ | Just signed up with culture tour ap.  It has a lot of information and good travel deals. | Half the content or more doesn‚Äôt open. 
Yes I‚Äôve tried to reset phone and update app and all other apps are working and wifi is fine | Usually really useful, the app does not seem to work properly. When I go check out the Guides, it just closes down the app | All of my saved trips are gone. 
All of my bookmarks are gone. 
The guides aren‚Äôt really there anymore, it‚Äôs just paid tours offerings that you can sign up for. 
I will be undownloading and not recommending to friends anymore until the app is better‚Ä¶ | From 1 to 4 years ago I used this app frequently to reference the guides when planning trips.  But sometime within the past year the guide function returns zero results for most of the world.  Many countries and cities that previously had many links through the app now have nothing. | I used to love this app and recommended it to everyone. It is so disappointing that I can‚Äôt search for anything, nor even access my saved trips. Please bring back the other features. | I used to peruse the app to find articles of places to try and now it doesn‚Äôt work at all.  Seems like they are pivoting to selling tours. ü§¢ Shame. | I used to love the content on this app but the app doesn‚Äôt work anymore. | This app has so much potential‚Ä¶if only it worked. Some of the options to select aren‚Äôt being selected when I try to click on them. I also charged the currency to $USD and prices are still showing up in ¬£. I can‚Äôt access ‚ÄúMy Plans‚Äù even though I saved a couple things there. To top it off, the app keeps crashing. Not a really good experience. | Was a decent app a few years ago in terms of articles, insights, and travel recommendations, but now is nothing more than a sales site aimed at selling trips/experiences. Collected a data base of potential customers over the years and then transitions to a sales site. Classic. | Don‚Äôt bother downloading the app. 

Not sure what changed in their business model but this app is really just for booking group trips now. I used to use it as a way to find cool local things to do in cities I used to travel to. Great way to plan a trip with blogs about tourist destinations, cafes, restaurants. | Can‚Äôt even search for a city. Used this for years and now it‚Äôs unusable. | Look I get it that businesses pivot. But you used to be my trusted travel blog that I would come to for every trip for cool recommendations. Now I cannot even find the guides because they‚Äôre so hidden behind your big push toward your new shiny object, the tours. 

Some of us veterans aren‚Äôt interested in tours. We came to your blog for self guided guides! I really wish that you‚Äôd make the guides findable for us in the native apps and web apps. | Sadly this app no longer works. I‚Äôm not sure why, but nothing will load. And it is extremely glitchy! | Hard to tell what the purpose of the app really is because it won't load anything, and yes, I'm connected to the internet. | This was once a fantastic app for things to do and see in places around the world.  All of that useful content is gone. Now it is just a booking app for group trips. | I‚Äôve been trying for weeks to get it to work and it does not load. Based on other reviews this is not an isolated issue. | This was one of the best sources of information especially for out of the way locales - the local guides on galleries, fashion, etc was superb. Please bring back the guides and local stories. The app is now glitchy and no longer links well to ‚Äúthings to do‚Äù or ‚Äúfood and drink‚Äù which made this an invaluable resource. | It‚Äôs a frustrating app which is sad because I love the offline articles and content. If I can get the app wouldn‚Äôt glitch so much. A simple search won‚Äôt upload the content | It crashes every few minutes!!! My saved pages went blank. Do I need to say anymore?  Very sad‚Ä¶ | Really sad to see the latest performance. I guess that‚Äôs there now Hass to be 3 inches of advertising on every page, however, you could just get the pages to load and I‚Äôd It be much happier. As I travel 100#, it‚Äôs sad to see this occur. | There used to be a method for searching for many interesting articles on various culture areas. That‚Äôs been removed and you only get opportunities to buy travel packages. 

Bummer. Delete. | Love the articles, hate the app itself. I‚Äôve used it for years but no long can stand it. Doesn‚Äôt save my favorites, can‚Äôt even search easy travel spots that I know there are articles for. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app and downloading a newer version. It‚Äôs useless. | I like the content but half the time there‚Äôs a white screen or an infinite loading state. | I‚Äôm able to register, search (slowly), but nothing shows up. Would love to use but the app needs to kinda work first. | It was a great app until the only thing you can access is now the paid trips that you can buy. I had articles saves for a trip I was planning (37 to be exact), and when I went to access my saved trip the articles no longer were there. Try to search for new articles? They appear on the front page of the app, unless you care to actually read them. When you click on the article nothing pulls up. Useless. | Location services seem to be down. Just downloaded the app, so I have no way to know if that‚Äôs an ongoing issue. ‚Äî There‚Äôs also no way to look up a smaller city and populate places in terms of distance. That would be really helpful. ‚Äî A map option to manually set my location would be a way around both of these issues and doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to populate a list on the map. | I booked a trip with culture trip and I am trying to edit the ‚Äútravel plans‚Äú and I am not able to do anything nor I see instructions on how to. | I miss the feature that showed you popular attractions and restaurants based on your current location | I have used this ap for several years now and my application for the vast information about even the remote corners of the world continues to grow.

Every travel lover needs this ap for their travel planning. | The app has not worked properly for me the last few months. It doesn‚Äôt let me search places, won‚Äôt display my plans, and it doesn‚Äôt save articles to my plans. I have updated it and nothing has changed. | I have imagine such a travel guide app for years. | I love the idea but plans and saved places get lost. My app says I have 6  plans, the webpage says 8, and neither show the 25 places added to my plan, 
Repeat issue | Very useful app for travelers. | A lot of the places have closed or moved since Covid. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be many additions since 2020. There is a lack of inclusion of black, Hispanic and lgbtq places. 

I think the app is a great idea and off to a good start but needs some work | There ‚Äòsave‚Äô feature is a mess and dies nit work. A waste of time. | This used to be a really cool app where you‚Äôd find great articles/suggestions for destinations. Guess it got bought out or something. Seems like it‚Äôs more of a booking platform now. Too bad. | Anytime the app actually loads I feel very lucky. Usually I open it and am just made angry as it loads for eternity. Seem every couple of week the app become unusable. The content is good which i would think is the hard part. The app is abysmal. Get it together guys. | I loved this app. I even gave it 5 stars. I now am unable to even enter the app. It freezes on start! I deleted it and reinstalled it several times to no avail.

Update: 28 May 2022 - the latest update has fixed the issues from before. Thank you!! | Help | I used to use this app all the time to help with trip planning. Recently it has totally stopped working; I cannot save any posts and cannot even log on the app. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it to see if it would fix the problem but it has not. I can‚Äôt access any plans I made previously either. The problem started around the time they took away the section about hotels/hotel booking. That was always a useful way to find out key details about amenities, neighborhoods, etc. Even without hotel information, the app would still be useful to plan dining and activities for travel. Unfortunately, due to its lack of functionality, the app is close to useless now. This has been weeks or months now. | Sign up sign in just don‚Äôt work for me | Looks like a good app but I can‚Äôt get in | Installed and used for a while, then upgraded an iPhone, all my saved data is gone, can‚Äôt log in, can‚Äôt use the app, gets stuck after the initial splash screen, can‚Äôt create a new account either. | Planning a summer getaway to Los Angeles, it was easy to navigate

One step forward and thirty backwards!!!!!!!

Photo, looks like it the quality of 30 years ago. Does not clear up, as you zoom in, gets worse as you zoom in. I use the this app all day long, looks like I will be looking for something different.

I‚Äôve also restarted the app as well.. | Good | I love it, but whenever I try to get on my phone to look at something up , the Earth is white and whenever I search an address and it zooms into the Earth but then it‚Äôs just black. | This app is great but most of the photos are old and not what it looks like today | Most of these views are from years ago. None of these are updated. | Need to update redvale Colorado | How do you erase your search history. I can‚Äôt pull it down below the typing area to hit erase. It‚Äôs a good app I love it but I can‚Äôt erase my history. that is all. | This app is so boring make everything 3-D if it‚Äôs flat you‚Äôre gonna get closed by the way, I tried We maps and it said we  maps is closed try our new app. Flymaps and Flymaps was never free. I rated a two star make sure to change it. | The new measuring system is terrible. They put the add point button DIRECTLY next to the done button (Which is stupid on its own) But to make it even worse: When you accidentally click the done button you cannot continue from where you left off. You have to start over (Yes completely. On the Help page it even says: ‚ÄúEdit your measurement. To measure again, on the right tap start new. Because you know thats how editing things work. You just start all over again) And if you‚Äôre measuring a large amount of space then its almost not worth retrying. The original version was INFINITELY better in every single way. Putting the done button directly next to the add point button and then making impossible to pick it back up is probably one the most ridiculous design flaws Ive seen in a very long time. | Im even waiting for the new update of this map. There are many many new places that aren‚Äôt in the map. We most need 2024 update ‚Ä¶ at least. Thanks. | Even after a recent update that was supposed to bring bug fixes, this app continues to glitch out. I can‚Äôt pull up full size images/location cards without them glitching and not going away, rendering the map unusable. This app used to be good and now it‚Äôs abysmal. | This app is great to use but now I question its validity. Lahaina Towne images have not been updated since the fire of August 8, 2023. That area destroyed by the fire is still not accessible to anyone but residents to their former home sites and the crews stripping the toxic wastes off their properties. What you see is not what you get. It‚Äôs a disservice to the community to provide such inaccurate views.

Makes me wonder what other inaccurate views of the earth are portrayed in this app. | Why is Google using old data? 
We used to be able to see the devastation of the fire.

Why is Google continuing to use old and inaccurate information? | Late to the game and so sad I updated. The ‚ÄúYour Projects‚Äù when collapsed is way too big a white blank blocking a significant portion of the Earth.  Can‚Äôt zoom in on photos. Terrible update. The previous interface was far superior. | Every time I make a placeholder the app starts glitching 
>:( | cool | Why update something only to make it worse?  It worked fine before, now it‚Äôs filled with bugs. You can‚Äôt zoom in on pics. And every time I click on a location to view pics the whole screen flickers and then freezes. Go back to the last version. This is not an improvement. | I love the new Projects tab - it's made keeping track of things I'm researching much easier now that I don't have to keep the material database and the name/info databases in separate apps. I'd give this feature 4/5 stars if I could, simply because the UI could be a tad better.

The issue is that I can't use this feature because of numerous bugs that occur every time I have tried to open/work on a project since last week. I don't know if this issue is unique to me or my phone, but often the menu I'm in will stay on screen but my inputs will log on the map behind it. Other times, when I try to edit something, the menu will begin violently flashing on and off the screen or moving around. The only way to stop this is to restart the app, just for it or another bug to start again.

Overall, the app is great and the new features are convenient and ambitious. However, they don't work at all. Please, I'm begging you, fix this. | I‚Äôve been using this app for over 3 years now, and today my screen constantly flickers. I tried updating the app, restarting the app, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, cleared the cache, cleared saved places, cleared the history, restarted my phone, refreshed the networks, nothing works. With the entertaining explorer taken out, it‚Äôs been going downhill ever since. | I can‚Äôt see anything other than blurry green and yellow colors‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt get back in time and see what earth looks like years back. | Why is every image blurry now? Never used to be this way | The Google Earth App worked wonderfully for me over the years. Now it will not work and has some kind of virus and keeps jumping around the screen and not functioning at all. I've tried to adjust the app settings and deleted and reinstalled the app several times but to no avail. 
There is nowhere you can ask for or get help from Google. | Why is Timelapse blurry on mobile? | This app used to be so handy and easy to use. I was able to look up locations and use the satellite view. I even used the projects. Now, everything I search is blurry, whereas before it was clear. Looking at big blobs of green, brown, and blue serve me no purpose. If the hidden box at the bottom of the screen is my menu, it is ineffective as well offering little customization. | I can spend HOURS upon HOURS on G Earth looking at all the amazing places that I will most likely NEVER get the chance to see (which is SAD but besides the point). 

The thing that IRRITATES me the most after many ‚ÄúUpdates‚Äù ago is in viewing Pics on G Earth. 
For instance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you have Street View on and want to look at the Pics but you do not have the capability to ZOOM IN on these Pics. WHY??

We used to be able expand these Pics to get a better look but now we don‚Äôt!! I just don‚Äôt get it?? 

Unless there is some type of way to expand the Pics and I just don‚Äôt know how?    I doubt that very much for I am not a beginner using Google Earth! | Hooray! Amazing! Whoopie! | This app has not been updated in like 4years | You Google mad I mean Google Earth you have been a mess. You clearly have not upgraded your thing in four years so I need you to upgrade it or else I will sue and guess what I will sue you if you do not change it because it‚Äôs been like four years, so change it up upgrade it take pictures around here and so I want you I want youto upgrade it so I can have pictures of my houses that were not four years ago so I have an apartment my old apartment I go on go out I look at it like that‚Äôs like four years ago because | Apparently, this update is not compatible with my iPhone 7 Plus. The touch screen does not work, the application freezes and crashed | I used to love this app on my phone but now I can‚Äôt even search for a place without the search wheel going round and round with zero results! 

Very disappointing  boo hiss | How come every update is one step forward and two steps backwards | Please more streets | Why hasn‚Äôt it been updated in years? The town I live in was added on to in 2019 it doesn‚Äôt exist on here | What has happened to this app?   There use to be a drop down menu in the upper left where one could take a postcard pic.  Don‚Äôt know what has been done, but it stinks.  No longer user-friendly.  And, that project in the lower left‚Ä¶what in the world is that? | Can not use map freezes and the map flickers useless | The earth is not a perfect sphere. This app shows earth as a perfect sphere when everyone knows its pear shaped. | please release Google Earth Pro for ipad Pro with apple silicon (M1 and other) ‚Ä¶. We need !!! | I‚Äôd like to start by saying I haven‚Äôt used Google Earth in my classroom for awhile. But now I need it and I‚Äôm having to relearn where everything is hidden/renamed. This app used to be so easy to navigate and I could easily direct my kids to the places I wanted them to explore. Now, I‚Äôve amassed a sheet of web links offering help - quite the waste of time when it could/should be in one place. (What happened to the downloadable pdf Guide? If it‚Äôs out there, I haven‚Äôt found it yet.)

Near as I can tell, Random Search has become I‚Äôm Feeling Lucky. Really? Why is that necessary? Cutesy titles are not helpful, especially when teaching 2nd-language learners. I‚Äôm guessing that Editor‚Äôs Picks is now Voyager. The transition between computer (Toolbar at the top) and tablet (iPad, in my case - finding Toolbar equivalent is not an easy task) should be uniform in appearance and function. Aside from using grid lines and reading latitude/longitude locations from there, what happened to the gps locations that used to be at the bottom of the page? They‚Äôre still there on the home location. And on the tablet, how do you relaunch Earth short of closing it down and starting over? And if you‚Äôre logged in, it opens to the screen you left. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | I love Google Earth. Mostly I used it on computer and iPad. I see a lot of changes in my area and surroundings however, the maps were not updated. Please UPDATE the map accordingly. | This new update I‚Äôll say has been frustrating.

Well that‚Äôs not entirely true. We now for the past 3 years shooting each other the top 20 email along with our joke of needing more time off work. The deals are real and we have had several great vacations. Thank you Travelzoo. | Joined under ‚Äú3 day trial - cancel anytime‚Äù and realized quickly that everything was a scam. They will list one price but once you click on it - the price doubles (at least). I‚Äôve spent HOURS looking and every single offer does this. The real kicker is there is no way to cancel the free trial, so I paid $40 to view click-bait. | Travelzoo is an awesome site to get bargains for travel it never disappoints | This app and it‚Äôs notifications have saved me time and money.   People are still clueless and afraid of using TravalZoo.  Don‚Äôt be.  The deals are real folks.  Don‚Äôt wait. | My favorite travel site, I see no reason to look anywhere else. | It show 400$ when you click on it, price jump to 1200$!! | We have used TravelZoo multiple times to go on different Vacations. Very happy with our Trips. There‚Äôs no telling how much we saved. This is a great way to see the world! | Love the app | When starting to brainstorm travel, just remember it‚Äôs now ok that it‚Äôs a ZOO at Airports. It‚Äôs simply Travel Zoo!! Knowledge is potential power. Saving thousands on a trip is true power, ACTION!! Thanks Zoo!!!!! | I‚Äôve been on many Travelzoo trips. They are always high quality, low, cost, and safe. I wait every Wednesday for my next update on the deals. Thanks for being such a great resource. DLW. | There‚Äôs never anything that lives out from my airport, so it‚Äôs pointless for me | Without landscape support, this app is useless to me. That‚Äôs sad, because I love Travelzoo! | The deals on this site and the customer service is great. Never less than par. | love the things to do and activities in my state of california | Booked several vacations thru Travelzoo.com and have never been disappointed! | I love receiving my weekly notification about travel deals. I enjoy traveling & getting good deals. Travelzoo provides me with what I need on a variety of travel destinations! | Always on top of the best deals offered.  Thanks | Been using the site a while Did Phl Argentina $600 plus tax 6 nites thru marnella

Plenty offers at everyone‚Äôs price | Very few offers with longer stays | Best prices you can find and simple to navigate through app | Won‚Äôt let me book. Keyboard gets stuck. | My wife got a great deal on a hotel in Asheville with all her tippler fruends. | Did a ski trip through Travelzoo and the place was great
Place awesome
Looking forward to more trips | Prefer the website. The App is too crowded and stuff not accurate. Kimpton deal in LA continues to cram back in the amenities fees that supposed to be waived. Tapping another path took me to Google and other suggested logins. Then it cannot because Google doesn‚Äôt it considered secure. App and paths would benefit from much better testing. No clean way get in app help or questions things. Just a slightly over engineered app that needs some additional testing. Back to web. | I have used Travelzoo for over ten years and it is always my first app to search for travel deals. Ten years ago my husband and I celebrated our 25th anniversary and had blocked out 3 weeks in May for the trip. I scoured Travelzoo for months and was able to grab an incredible trip to Australia with flights included from U.S. and 2 flights in country plus 12 nights of great hotels the first week of May. My husband was nervous about not booking earlier but I knew that Travelzoo would come through! Have booked many great spa days in Chicago and excellent dinners on the App. Never been disappointed by the quality of the experience or the value that Travelzoo offered. Planning a 35th anniversary trip this May and know that Travelzoo will come up with an amazing trip deal for us. | Love Travel Zoo!! Never have been let down!! | I have been using travel zoo for years! I tell everyone about it!! We have traveled to places like London, a 3 week tour in Vietnam, hotels & spa packages in Vail, Colorado and a Caribbean cruise to name a few. All our trips were Amazing and great deals! 
I look forward to the top 20 deals coming out every Wednesday!! | What a dump. Shame on you Travelzoo for promoting this dump. Shower did not have hot water, nor did it drain properly, room heater was loose and never heated the room warm enough even though thermostat was on hottest setting- 85 degrees. Bathroom sink was hot and cold were reversed. Bathroom was incredibly cramped. For Travelzoo to promote this, I now don‚Äôt trust your website. | Highly recommend it app if traveling at a discount is your goal. | I‚Äôm a long time user of Travelzoo. I enjoy the easy to navigate app. Chootie88 | I‚Äôve been checking TravelZoo for several years for travel bargains. Many, many people I know ask where I get my info and good travel deals. 
I always say Sign up for TravelZoo. It‚Äôs the best resource for reasonable and good travel locations. | Travelzoo has allowed my husband and my self to travel 2 times a year due to lower prices üòÅ.

We have been using travelzoo for over 15 years, at least twice a year! I can hardly wait till the new trips come out on Wednesdays! Great way to travel the world for very reasonable prices! | Great app | It's very helpful to find a dream vacation . | I have been using Travel Zoo for a few. Years now. The deals that they offer are fabulous. I have told so many people to check out this wonderful site. We are now retired, but for many years we were a family of five. Sometimes living from paycheck to paycheck. We definitely took advantage of some very affordable vacations. I also just love looking on the site to get ideas, or to just dream! | Cellular data is turned off for Travelzoo | Travel zoo was once a decent app. Now it‚Äôs a lot of third-party shenanigans. Not sold on it. I‚Äôll do my own research thanks! | I love travelzoo they always have the best deals at the cheapest prices, no scams no telemarketers just good honest deals for people who love to travel | Because of Travel Zoo I have traveled to places I never thought were possible. | Travelzoo has the best deals the best aventures and the best dreams! | My name Is Jose Rivera from Puerto Rico, Thanks to your reliable and excellent offers I have known many places in the world since I discovered them 4 years ago.!! Thank you travelzoo | Most people love packages that include air. People worry they won‚Äôt find a good air rate.  Please show more air-inclusive packages and tours, as you used to do. | I‚Äôm happy to be able to access this application to find great deals for travel. We are always satisfied! | I love Travelzoo! So many wonderful travel and food options. Can‚Äôt wait to go on my next trip to Costa Rica. | Selected the wrong language and don‚Äôt know how to change to English | Since my wife and I found travelzoo we have taken advantage of several trips. We have experience places we never dreamed of at great rates. I look at the top twenty almost every week just to see what might pop up. Never had a bad experience with their deals. Love it. | Thank you Travelzoo, I have received several great deals using your service over the years, from airfares and hotels, car rentals, restaurants, and various places of interest. The information you provide has been invaluable, and I thank you! | Looking for any travel needs- Travelzoo is the place to find it !! We love it!! | Great deals.

I did then it said coupon expired!!!!! | Why are the prices higher for the exact same room using your app than booking on your website? This makes no sense. | Booked a room through the app thinking it had the best deal, and then looked to see what it would‚Äôve cost to book directly with the hotel. The app ended up costing me $51 more for a non refundable room. Won‚Äôt be using it again. | I thought the lodge was great | Not real happy with Travelocity as you are not able to select seats. They place you where ever they want, even not next to family members | This is the worst app. I have my settings set for English. And when I search for a flight, it switches to Spanish. It is so aggravating! | Why ask for a review 10 seconds into a search on your site? | The check-in process was easy. The staff was kind and attentive. The location is great and the property is well-kept. | We Are The Best | Not sure why I am seeing Spanish when I checked English. | Travelocity has always been confident and secure with all of my travel needs! I always use Travelocity for all my travel needs!!
Thank you!! | Great | Why is it so hard to talk to someone? | When I scanned the QR code, it didn‚Äôt take me to my flight information. It doesn‚Äôt save me. | Went to book a room and afterwards was told it was a smoking room. No refund even though I purchased their worthless insurance. Stuck | I hate your app | You try to make your password when you try to get in it tells you you cannot get in until after 15 minutes that‚Äôs really awful. | Love the app for the most part with regard to ease of use, finding flights, etc. ~ big frustration is finding the perfect flights and price, then they increase significantly at check out. My only complaint, but its a huge problem. Would love to be able to trust the process. Thanks ~ | I booked a room for a over seas trip and needed to add another person to the reservation. After several attempts through the app I was unable to update my booking. A full 56 days before the trip I contacted an agent online only to be told that the couldn‚Äôt get ahold of the hotel, that the only way to upgrade my reservation was to cancel it and rebook or find another place. So I cancelled, the reservation clearly stated that I could cancel the reservation up to a week before with no problem. I then received an email saying that I would have to pay a cancellation fee because the reservation was cancelled to late for a full refund. I purchased trip insurance and then found out that it wasn‚Äôt refunded and was cancelled so no refund at all! I will not use this app again. | My flight and hotel was booked through Travelocity and my flight was cancelled and I tried calling to get refunded my money from the hotel. I spoke to 2 different people and they both hung up on my face with no help at all my fianc√©e had just lost his son and they didn‚Äôt even take that into consideration at all. The customer service from both the representatives from Travelocity were very unprofessional and rude by continuously hanging up in my face. I will never book with this hotel nor Travelocity again!!!!üò° Spirit gave me my money back but the hotel would not refund my money‚Ä¶.!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!! | I made through Travelocity.. landed.. waited for Thrifty transport van to pick me up. Showed the van  driver my reservation on  my phone. 
He says.. we  don‚Äôt have  your reservation AND.. we have 0 cars.
.. so.. here I‚Äôm standing in a foreign country without a car. The nice man monitoring the parking at the airport hooked me up with a local company.  
Just think .. if they had no cars!! I had 80 minute drive to my destination. I‚Äôll Never hook again on your website. I travel  frequently.. so this was the first experience of no reservation when I could prove I had  one.
Get your act together‚Ä¶ I hear this is not uncommon of your website. 
Might want to fix it b4 you lose more users.. | I made this reservation in January when I first knew of the wedding this weekend.  From the pictures, your place seemed perfect for my husband and me!!! However, when my husband came check in, he found that we were to be on  the  3rd floor! He has had 2 recent knee replacements and is having heart surgery soon!! There is NO WAY that he could have navigated that during our weekend in Charleston!!! Please refund the $715 to me asap. | I worked with an agent named Rome today with an issue and she was so helpful I wanted to make sure she got the praise she deserved. This is not the first time I‚Äôve received help from Travelocity - wonderful customer service üëçüòÄ | Dates do not correspond to actual calendar! | The website doesn‚Äôt recognize me as a person. I ca t figure out your puzzle, the arrow does nothing. I have an existing itinerary that I can‚Äôt access | Granted, I just installed the app on my iPad, a little bit difficult to navigate, I can‚Äôt find the most important thing which is the itinerary, which I just booked 10 minutes ago. I‚Äôll close this and go back in and why do I see Expedia at the bottom of a page when this is Travelocity.? thanks I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get it. It‚Äôs just you should see a link to my itinerary right on the homepage of Travelocity when you login. Thanks. | I have used Travelocity for years and have been extremely pleased with the help and services they provide. I give them a five star rating. | I have spent over an hour attempting to report a fraudulent charge made on my credit card by another one of your customers.  It was impossible to get onto contact with any human being to discuss this allegation.  The email I sent to the one provided to me by the help desk was kicked back to me as ‚Äúundeliverable‚Äù.  I refuse to do any future business with your agency going forward.  I do not associate with companies who fail to practice solid/transparent business practices. | See above! üòÉ | I only speak & read in English! The app downloaded was in Spanish | I have version 2024.7 on my ipad. It only allows flight sorting by number of stops.  My iPhone has an earlier version and allows sort by duration. Why would they disable this feature?  Bad!! | If you can‚Äôt login, you can‚Äôt use it. Keeps telling me to double check, which I meticulously have. But no dice. | Luggage seat choice not included you don‚Äôt care about my comfort | Check in and the Hotel were very good. The staff was promo and helpful. Travelocity on the other hand gets less than One Star. They were awful   I paid for my room through Travelocity , however Hyatt place had no record of that so I had to pay again. I‚Äôll NEVER use Travelocity again. They‚Äôre awful and heaven forbid you have to talk to a human. Even that is difficult | Loved it! | I love staying at the Lord Nelson! So much history and great location. The rooms are cute! | I clearly checked the box for English language | T  TV c saw | You keep sending me information about bookings in Nairobi! I mean LOTS of them ! Daily. And I never searched Nairobi, nor do I have any desire to go there! Please STOP!üõë | Dollar Rental didn't have a car for me that I rented through Travelocity. Dollar couldn't cancel and no easy way to cancel through Travelocity | Very clean, made you feel like you were checking into your home! Have stayed here before and will stay here again!! | I booked a flight to Puerto Rico a few months ago on Jet Blue. Thought I got a good deal when I went to get my ticket the kiosk computer requested $80 extra dollars for the cheapest seat. When I purchased my ticket I thought it was for a seat on the plain. Scam. | It shows I have one flight but got 17 charges on my card. Very confusing. Flight price changed while I was paying. Not very smooth. Easier to work with airlines direct. | Attempted on various days to cancel reservation through a virtual agent prior to booking date. 
Travelocity/Expedia proved to be unreliable and unable to retrieve information for cancellation. It claimed there were no itinerary on file. I have been charged a fee for a night of ‚ÄúNo-Show‚Äù policy through the hotel. Recommend booking to the hotel directly. | This app is very confusing, and the service is trash. I accidentally cancelled my cancellation insurance which I didn‚Äôt even know you could do. I couldn‚Äôt get anyone on the phone and the virtual assistance is confusing and unhelpful. It transferred between a few people, and nobody seems to know what‚Äôs going on. Save yourself the trouble and find a real travel agent instead of throwing your money away. | Everything is in Spanish. When I tried to change to English, this app wouldn‚Äôt let me save the change. | I am very disappointed in the decline of Travelocity. I would no longer use or recommend. | I had instructions on my email about the check in and code for the gate but code didn‚Äôt work. I had to call the authority and stay on line 30 minutes and then go through identification process and put all the information again including credit card numbers, photos of my ID and then my picture to register again to get a new code for the gate. Then room door code wasn‚Äôt working and had to wait to reset the code. I booked a hotel room with 2 full beds but room has only one king bed.
No extra linen and blankets which suppose to be behind the sofa in a bag. | Most of the app is in Spanish. I don‚Äôt speak Spanish. Language I selected is English. Didn‚Äôt do well in high school Spanish so app is useless. | I‚Äôm trying to book a flight back it says it‚Äôs available when I check through a different airlines but when I choose the departing flight for some reason it‚Äôs not available. Both flights were available last week. I find this to be a very frustrating & price gouging Situation. I have always used Travelocity when booking my flights.

Is an employee at Renaissance Marriott and provides the ultimate customer service experience. He is very knowledgeable with all of the processes and was able to help me extremely! I felt very welcomed with his service and care for his customers! Thanks Kirko T! | We checked in today and waited 90 minutes for our luggage when delivered, we received 9 of our 12 pieces! | It brings up my reservation but won‚Äôt add it. | I travel roughly 75 to 85 nights a year and almost always stay at a Marriott property. I like the perks and reliability of the different chains. One drawback is some of the nicer hotels cost quite a bit and points if you intend to use them.a basic hotel might cost 30,000 points a night but a nice one would cost 70 to 80,000. So it might take a while to accrue enough points to get a nice hotel that you want. Otherwise, very reliable and I will keep staying at Marriott as much as possible. | This app is awesome! | Good program! | It is difficult to get a hold of somebody on the phone. Your voice systems transfer us all over the place. | My Marriott Bonvoy App is not working on my IPhone. If tried twice to uninstall and then reinstall with no success. Then I tried twice to clear all browsing and cookies cache again with no success. I then called Marriott Bonvoy Customer Service and they confirmed that my account is active and up to date. Then they suggested that I should uninstall and then reinstall the App and then I should clear the cache. After I told them that I tried both of them twice they said good luck!!!  Could I please get some help? | Every time I try to login it want open and says to call for help but gives no number to call. | Easy to navigate.  Fast way to find a Marriott brand hotel wherever I want to go. | I enjoy the luxury ambiance and comfort that comes with with the Marriott brand. | This app doesn‚Äôt work since iOS 17.4.1 | After 4 weeks of run around and the loss of  31,000 points I was told you cannot use the app to book free night awards.  Nor will they fix it despite numerous assurances they would refund the points.  Other than that, it works well but am now considering other more reliable options. | I really enjoy it is amazing and what I love the most is that always I find a good place all around the world. | Booking through the app is so easy and helpful | Great app for those that travel frequently. | Manager  ‚ÄúErica‚Äù is by far one of the rudest people in customer service I have ever met in my life this is the 2nd time I‚Äôve had a problem with her. She‚Äôs awful. Residents Inn in Fort Wayne, In. Everyone else has been extremely nice. She always has a nasty attitude when she‚Äôs working at night. Surely this isn‚Äôt the first time you‚Äôve heard about her. Some people should not be working in customer service. | We hit a pothole in Evanston, WY. 5 hours later we were back on the road. Changed our room from Kearney to Sydney, NE. Then,  looking at road closures on I-80, redirected to Rapid City, SD to continue our trip on I-90 east. Changed reservations twice in 2 hours as our trip was getting longer and the weather conditions were getting worse. | A new update has prevented my app from opening and now displaying 6209:6230 after deleting and reloading the app. The original error message was 6209:9D41. Form a previous review it seems that they are no help in resolving this issue. The message basically wants us to remove Norton security and allow them to have access to our ip address. All other similar apps do not require and work just fine. Marriott wants us to disable our web proxy settings. Marriott‚Äôs website does not require this so why does the app? The Marriott Bonvoy app, not confirmed by apple, but could be wide open on collecting all of your data and searches from your ip address. I am using Marriott less and less since the error message due to inconvenience. If you are not going to stop this security breach on your customers at least own it and let us know! | I want to give a shout out to Shon,  who was so helpful, polite and patient with me. It is experiences like this that keep me coming back.

thank you so much Shon, for making my busy hectic life a little less crazy! | Works great to book and keep my reservations in one place!  I highly suggest it | Everywhere I travel, the Bonvoy app, makes it easy! From easily, finding hotels, directions, even hotels. Stay receipts. Love it! | Habitaciones c√≥modas | Doesn‚Äôt work on Wi-Fi. And why do I need to sign in again when I‚Äôm already on the app? | Great customer service, quality hotels, and great deals. | My stay was a 10/10 get hotel it was clean and the bed was soft and Kenny have great customer service excellent location | Myself and my family walked in the room to relax and here comes a roach crawling up the wall. | The App App doesn‚Äôt support critical phone security tools from Norton. | I have been using the app since it first came out. Now it reports an erroneous security error if you use WiFi and a vpn‚Ä¶which in all accounts is the most secure way to use a hotel connection. This is hardly as useful if I have to use over cellular only. I also believe 2-factor authentication is broken during setup via text. | Tried opening app and kicks you off every time. Doesn‚Äôt seem to work in iPhone .  I don‚Äôt recommend. Please fix your app. | The ability to browse global hotels by map without selecting a date has gone with the update. NEED IT BACK!!! | This place is great, is just alot of money but is nice, beautiful, & quiet i love being here. Breakfast is really good too. | Haven‚Äôt been able to use it in months. Every time I try to use the app, I get a message that there‚Äôs an issue with my sign in. Don‚Äôt have any issues with the Hilton, Hyatt or any other app. | I love you | The latest update will not work on a iPhone. When I attempt to open it, I see an error message that says ‚ÄúThere may be a security issue with your Internet connection‚Ä¶.‚Äù with a recommendation to disable any VPN. 

This is from a corporation that suffered a personal data leak not long ago. Plus, even after disabling VPN the message still appears. Ironically, I can‚Äôt use it with the WiFi while staying at a Marriott!

However, my Hilton app works fine. Guess which chain is more likely to get my next reservation? | Amazing. | What a stupid UX friction point at login you‚Äôve introduced. | I‚Äôm planning my European voyage and Tour, and never had an app so easy to use to book hotels. | The app often times malfunctions or won‚Äôt load properly. I‚Äôve had this happen on multiple different WiFi‚Äôs and just using cellular data, so it shouldn‚Äôt be a connection issue. Makes it frustrating trying to book. | Was on drive trip didn‚Äôt want to tie myself down to making reservations all before our trip. So when we got close to stopping for the night I would Bonvoy the area and always had a selection! Was great to make my choices based on where we were instead of where we were supposed to be. Loved it!! | I was assigned a room only as big as the bed, next to the street which caused truck noise to wake me at 4:30 am, had no sleep after that. I was given a late checkout but not advised about the room key reset. Could not get in my room. This room must‚Äôve been a janitor‚Äôs closet converted to a room. The hallway narrowed so much that wouldn‚Äôt fit the housekeeping cart. Awful Experufor a Marriott. | Mobile key doesn‚Äôt work
How hard is it to get a guest in a room | App needs to be upgraded along with the website it‚Äôs extremely slow and constantly kicks you out of the webpage and doesn‚Äôt show available hotels | Give me some way to stop the ‚Äúenable notifications‚Äù pop up from popping up every time I open the app.  I DO NOT WANT notifications.  I‚Äôm ok with just keeping them in my calendar.  I can‚Äôt use mobile key or mobile check in because I travel with other people whom I‚Äôm not sharing  my Marriott account info with.

So give me a ‚Äúdo not show this again‚Äù check box please.  You can put it right below ‚Äúenable notifications‚Äù

Sean
Lifetime Platinum and 3 nights from ANOTHER titanium year. | I stayed at Fairfield Inn in Hardeeville! It was super clean and the staff was very nice and professional. Bed was amazing! I slept like a baby! Thanks for a wonderful stay! | Every single time the app is opened it asks to enable notification to ‚Äòreceive promotions‚Äô. AppStore should ban apps with such behavior. | Make this your place to stay in Sydney. | Marriott has and continues to take care of me and my family.

I appreciate him . | The first experience was very well from communicating and the nice driver. | Rusty was a great driver.  He was quick and very friendly.  Hope to have him drive for us again. | I confirmed a ride at $36 for a 7mi ride, already surge price. The sec I got in the car it changed to $72. The driver even agreed it had to be a mistake and I‚Äôd just need to contact cs to get it fixed. 
Jokes on us- they don‚Äôt have customer service. 
Fine print in the policy says that if you have any more than a 10 sec delay between choosing and confirming the ride, it‚Äôs your fault if the rates just ‚Äúhappen‚Äù to double or triple. Meaning you agree to a ride at one price but they‚Äôre allowed to charge you something completely different if you miss the 10 sec window. 

The whole point of confirming is so we can check addresses and payment info and they use it as a tactic to straight up scam their customers. They charge whatever they feel like and unless you want to cancel your card, they get away with it.
Pathetic that we all just shout into the void and they just keep stealing money. Odd that all the 5 star reviews are actually trash feedback. Wonder what that‚Äôs about. | Hacked my card, charged me and now I can‚Äôt contact anyone for my money back 6 different charges over 20.00$ and no explanation. Never again | Great guy and nice driver. Was patient when I couldn‚Äôt find the spot he was parked at the airport | Nice talking money! | Good drivers and acceptable vehicles are so random‚Äî‚Äî I wish there were an app to request non-smoking interiors!‚Äî-I had to drive with the windows down in Wendy‚Äòs car. I got an instant headache, and couldn‚Äôt breathe for the smell of the stale ashtray smoke.!‚Äî-the worst! | I paid extra for priority pickup and my ride was an extra 5 minutes late. Surely that‚Äôs not how that is supposed to work? | Congratulations | Uber is expensive, unreliable, poor technology (does not remember regular places you‚Äôve been) - Lyft rules! | Diver helped with package to the front door | time after time Lyft fails and leaves me waiting absurd amounts of time due to inexplicable reassignments and other delays. the animated cars on maps are a complete fraud - these rides are NOT actually available. its time for this sham to go away. apps like Curb that partner with taxi services are infinitely more reliable, less expensive and often cleaner vehicles. | The CEO can‚Äôt even do math so why should their maps work. This company is goung down the drain fast! Just lousy!!!! | He was honest, outgoing, helpful, knowledgeable, cared about safety, one of the best drivers I have come across. I would like to have him in future trips if possible. | Best driver I‚Äôve ever had | She is so nyc | When I selected a destination, the app told me that the cab would pick me up in 4 minutes. When I confirmed, I received a message that a driver will be found in 1-5 minutes. I waited for 10 minutes, half of which was the app telling me ‚Äújust a few more seconds‚Äù to find a driver. I get it that times are only estimates, but what‚Äôs the point of estimates that aren‚Äôt even close!! | What a way to experience my first trip to Boston.  Our Lyft driver was very friendly.  This always makes the trip more special when you travel.  Thank you Lyft. | Jay arrived early, had a nice, clean car, and was a joy to talk to on my ride. | I had the worst experience while waiting outside in the rain for a driver. Clearly he doesn‚Äôt understand the app because he thought if he kept driving around I would be charged. Made me late to pick up my car from the mechanic before the shop closed and I‚Äôm soaking wet. I tried calling and texting the driver and never got a response. Also Lyft has no way to call them inside or outside the app. After 30 minutes of trying to chase down the driver in the rain soaking wet  I had gave up trying to get help from Lyfts help center and I canceled the ride. Now I have to wait who knows how long to get my refund so I can contact a real cab service . | A bit high. | Such as easy process.  First time user. Reserved ride. Driver early/on time. Chop chop. No hassle. Will definitely use Lyft again. One less hassle when taking a trip. | Great drivers, NEVER had an issue. However their gift card process is a terrible mess. My cousin is pregnant and may go into labor soon. Purchased a $50 gift card for her so she has means to the hospital if we‚Äôre not around. I tried buying the gift card on the app and it wouldn‚Äôt let me. Said I needed to add a new card even though I already had my bank card on there. Bought it through Amazon instead. She received it but when she went to try it out it won‚Äôt allow her and keeps asking for a new card too?! She already had her bank card, plus $50 gift card ‚Ä¶ but it keeps asking her for another card? We have both tried reaching out to Customer Service, but the only way is to go through a chat in the app. All they say is to add a new card. Won‚Äôt tell us what is wrong, just ask us to add a new card. This is ridiculous. At this point it feels like it would‚Äôve been better to choose a different company. | App response is fast, the rides are less expensive than ‚Äúthe other app‚Äù so far the cars have been very clean and the rides were safe. | Recommended | üîäADS NEED TOO BE BLOCKED I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCIDENTALLY SELECTING DUE TO MY DISABILITIES ‚ò∫Ô∏èDefinitely not user friendly and too many ADS while requesting rides. Rating drivers I wish it can be done at a later time, my first trip I had the most wonderful driver but because of the difficulties using I could not fill out all rating sections. Hey more confusion when requesting rides the list and rates looks different for AAR riders. SAFETY CHECK why doesn‚Äôt it come like text? I don‚Äôt use safari, it used too much data on my device. OH one more request can I rate my driver at a later meaning when I get home, it would be better rating procedure. Thanks. | Great service | Scheduled pickup. Driver was almost here then she dropped out. System allocated another driver, then another. Third driver was over 20 minutes behind the scheduled pickup time. | Erich | Thank you Lyft | Really nice driver great listener | Better than Uber | i took a ride of lyft for the airport. i normally pay $40 with tip. this time i was up charged $56. they send a 10 year old dirty car. inside the car it was really dirty and it smelled. on top of that the driver was unsafe making hard stops and hard accelerations. unfortunately i could not cancel as i was heading to the airport for a flight. i immediately contact lyft and was told i would get a measly 5$ credit‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm still flighting with my credit card to get my a refund. i do not recommend lyft because their customer service doesn‚Äôt work with clients and most of the time the cars are old and smell. | Not able to locate the pickup which was mentioned in the ride and the maps which was mentioned over there is showing a wrong path. Driver doesn‚Äôt respond for the message or call.You will be charged for the cancellation of the ride on top this. | Unable to upload rides when requested so have to get rides from Uber instead. Only able to get rides when requested from my car service department | Excelentes en tiempo, personal y calidad de servicio | The app sent the driver to the part of the airport, also I paid for a roomer car and did not get it.  I got charged extra to get to the right door at the airport | Excellent people | Almost missed flight | I love scheduling a ride, being switched drivers 4 times, being picked up 20 minutes late, and no way to provide that feedback in the app. So I‚Äôm doing that here. | Like it much better than Uber | My drive was goodHe was polite and courteous | Comfy  ride, nice driver, got us where we needed to be in no time. | Great service | 5 minutes turns into a $35 lyft fee all because frontier cancels.

Fixed bugs to ensure you can update gas prices in Waze successfully.","4.102",0,"USD",true,323229109,"Waze Inc.","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/waze-inc/id323229109?uo=4","http://www.waze.com",4.84821,"When you‚Äôre in a time zone, traveling to another time zone, your destination time should reflect the appropriate time and the time zone that you‚Äôre arriving in. Waze dropped the ball, driving from California to Utah. We had to be in Utah by 4:30 PM. We were on track on time with 30 minutes to spare, unfortunately as soon as we hit the Utah border Waze changed the arrival time and we lost an hour and now we‚Äôve missed out on a huge opportunity.
   And minus one more star for Waze always overheating my phone, no other app causes my iPhone to overheat. | very inaccurate information | I use this app for years (now is 2024) and i like it very much. One thing I wish is  that the button for Saved locations will be placed on main screen | Waze has been integral to my daily commute over the past three years. Using the app on an almost daily basis, I have gotten well acquainted with the app's various features and quirks. The community-sourced aspect of the app has set it apart from the alternatives; however, the gap is beginning to close.

Waze's real-time user reports have always been the app's bread and butter feature. The extensive range of reports and verbal callouts has set Waze apart from its competitors. These reports have become an indispensable tool in avoiding hazards along my drives.

Despite the many positive features that crowd-sourcing information has brought to the app, there are many areas where this approach is starting to hold the Waze back. One of the main issues with the app has been its failure to display anticipated road closures. Often, I encounter roads where the state Department of Transportation has placed a construction report pin and indicates the road will be closed within the comments. Waze will still provide navigation through the closed road. Users can submit closure reports, but they will only be visible for a limited time. To indicate an extended closure, a high-level map editor must mark the closure. At this point, you have likely already encountered the closure and are scrambling to find a detour.

Furthermore, locating POIs in the app has become an increasingly arduous task. Trying to enter a destination without an exact address feels more akin to an old GPS unit than a modern app. In addition, the crowd-sourcing model has left several POIs in rural areas well out of date. When traveling on a trip, this can be particularly annoying if you are looking for somewhere to stop and eat or make a rest stop.

Recently, while using the app, I have experienced many inconsistencies in the user interface. Although UI updates can be expected, the intrusiveness while navigating has been excessive. Many features have changed on an almost weekly basis or have been intermittently broken.

Overall, these developments have led to a rather mediocre experience. For an app that has prided itself on navigation beyond normal situations, it has continually underperformed in my experience. | I loved having/using Waze on the occasion when I needed directions. As someone who has to meet clients and go to different locations from time to time it was very convenient and always spot on. 

Now we fast forward.. the new immediate integration with car play is beyond annoying and the worst update. I don‚Äôt need to know things in my way around town. I dont need to know how to get to someplace 10 miles away that I frequent. I know where my gym is; I don‚Äôt need directions. 

And more than anything.. I don‚Äôt need my battery destroyed all day because this app ‚Äúneeds‚Äù to be connected/running for ZERO reason. Later Waze | I have used Waze for several years now, and loved it. I upgraded my iPhone to a 12 and it makes my phone really hot. So much so that I‚Äôm afraid to use it for fear of damaging my phone. 
I would like to make a suggestion though. Please put a pause button on it. When we off for bathroom breaks, fuel, or food we have to listen to ‚Äúrecalculating‚Äù new turns, ‚Äúrecalculating ‚Äú over and over or turn it off. Pause would be great. | Bring back Morgan Freeman voice‚Ä¶ Best voice ever. | Use it all the time, works great | Firstly, I love this app and is my default! Living in Georgia we have a TON of trains! 

It would be sooooo helpful if there was a way for the app to give the option for an active train crossing and/or a time estimator for us to see if we need to reroute!

Just a suggestion üëçüèΩ | After the update, Waze is no longer warn speed traps or red light camera. It only shows (flashes) it on the map which is very dangerous for a driver to watch the road and see the maps on your phone at the same time. Please fix your bug. Thank you | Waze looks like it has upgraded all its reporting options on the App on my iPhone, but these options do not show up on my large CarPlay screen? Why can‚Äôt Waze make this happen? 

We as of today we know have detailed reporting available on the CarPlay screen, thank you! | The new update I‚Äôd great. The User Interface is much better, highly detailed map, much sharper. The new arrangement with the icons is the best yet. Being able to use police hidden, or other side through apple play is fantastic. All hazards under one location stead of going back and forth. Well done! | Used to me my one and only navigation app. Got a car with Apple CarPlay and can‚Äôt deal with the ridiculous GPS problems with Waze. Random location loss and incorrect navigation makes Waze unusable with CarPlay. It‚Äôs a shame. I guess I have to transition to Apple Maps. | Do the developers not do any testing? This latest several versions has a gap on the right hand side of the screen where there‚Äôs just nothing. It‚Äôs the backing of the map, with nothing drawn in. The report button is on top of this area so clearly they know that this portion of the screen exists. But there‚Äôs just nothing there. And then the vehicle indicator and navigation if you are using that‚Ä¶ Is left hand shifted in the remaining 2/3 of the screen that has the map. So the vehicle indicator is actually closer to the left-hand edge of the screen then it is to the center. Do they not look at this on multiple devices? Is there anyway to request that they actually test the program before they make changes?

They have made it much worse. | Apple Car Play - Intermittent SPEED LIMIT/SPEEDOMETER DISPLAY operation tried everything still displays intermittently‚Ä¶..NOTE:SPEED LIMIT/Speedometer all the time shows on phone just not on CarPlay‚Ä¶. | Person with a GIS degree here (geography/map data science). You need to return the map editor layer back to its original colors. Ever since google bought Waze functionality has been reduced in favor of making the map look pretty. The only reason I kept Waze was for it‚Äôs elaborate off road network because anyone can add to it. Waze was ironically very useful for intended offroading. Off road trails are now difficult to see while driving while using the map editor layer. This also makes it easier for normal drivers to accidentally start off-roading. So I guess we‚Äôll be sticking to Gaia GPS and editing through OpenStreetMaps for my off-roading needs and continue using Apple Maps, because has been significantly improved. Just two cents from someone who could probably do your job better. | I have been using the Waze app for several years and it‚Äôs accuracy is so much better than apple or Google maps IMO. It alerts me timely when I need to leave to get my daughter to doctors appointments and we arrive as planned‚Ä¶ and she has several appointments ALL OVER Southern California. Having other ‚Äúwazers‚Äù help update issues on the road is the best as it‚Äôs real time (most times) which helps drivers be safer and more aware of road conditions, accidents, and police. Highly recommended!!! | Love Waze and I use it all the time. Living in rural Georgia I always chuckled when Waze would say ‚Äúwatch out, roadkill on road ahead‚Äù. Miss that lighthearted option for a generic hazard. | App will NOT close when phone is connected to CarPlay. | Poor user experience. I cannot see the destination once waze is connected to CarPlay, and the route overview is hard to find. This can leads to extremely tricky situation when the user inputs the destination with Siri, and Siri misunderstands the words. I have no way no check if the destination is correct unless disconnecting and reconnecting the Carplay. Doing so can be very dangerous on highway. | This is a great app only 4 stars because it stopped giving audible alerts for speed and red light cameras, it pops up on the phone but you can‚Äôt see while driving It just stopped on its own I checked all the settings and there should be no reason it stopped giving the audible camera warnings unless it‚Äôs a glitch or they stopped it but overall a good app | Waze used to be magic for urban navigation. Over the last year it has continuously underperformed. Worse, it has sent me on wild goose chases down closed roads, wasting significant time. Apple Maps is now a much better app than Waze. I have deleted it from my phone. | The apps add a stop feature has been having issues the past few months the color used to be purple now it‚Äôs teal making hard to tell the difference with the already light blue route line, it also at many times not show a difference in color at all and you don‚Äôt get the same heads up and end up missing the spot | Its a very helpful feature to know if theres a stop sign up ahead or how many lights i need to pass before turning. I love this app but thats the only thing keeping me from edging to this app | Deliberately takes you through  traffic‚Ä¶glitches a lot switches address all the time‚Ä¶ app is garbage! | The app is great but I would like to see satellite mapping on Waze it would make it easier thank you Jacob Greenawalt | I love ways for long distance. That‚Äôs about the only time I‚Äôm using it and 90% of the time I‚Äôm running Apple Maps in the background. It‚Äôs for two simple reason. I can see stop lights and which lane to be in on Apple Maps. Although the lane designation isn‚Äôt always accurate because the city I live in the streets are constantly changing so I can imagine that‚Äôs difficult. Knowing where stop lights are and stop signs allows me to drive better as a driver knowing what sections to expect and what sections not to expect. It‚Äôs actually a huge part of driving knowing where and when those signs are. I love Waze and the little stuff you can do on it but that‚Äôs what separates Waze from being my daily GPS. We need icons for streets signs. There need to be stop light icons. | The only time that I get a message that charging of my iPhone battery is been put on hold is when I use this app.  My phone gets very warm when using this app. | This app makes you take 70 side roads instead of making it simple. Also it just led me into an hour of traffic in Boston instead of taking me a different way. Terrible | PLEASE let us mark road closures on apple CARPLAY!!! Save everyone the pain of unplugging their phone to do it in the app!!! | Everytime I open the app my ‚Äúmood‚Äù character is different. I do not log out and it‚Äôs been happening for a few weeks. Also, what happened to the animals by shoulder report option. Other than that great app | The app is great but the feature for finding gas stations is lacking. It does not give the option to list prices for diesel fuel. | Please bring back boy band voice guidance. I can not pay attention like I do with your new voice guidance. Boy band was funny, kept you awake and alert while driving. Please! | Decent app, used to like it before 12 cracked it. Do not use waze in atlanta GA you will regret it. | WAZE can no longer be trusted. Google made sure of that. An update is supposed to improve not hinder the operation of the app ‚Ä¶ which Google has failed to comprehend or ...   Google Maps have been wrong more than they have been right in my experience. WAZE NEVER took me down a narrow road that led to a dead end in the middle of nowhere! That‚Äôs why I got WAZE. And in my honest opinion that was probably why the WAZE program was written, because Google couldn‚Äôt deliver.  And they don‚Äôt like fun!! All the avatars are gone! How can it be real time time if can‚Äôt report safely? Google is purposely killing WAZE in my opinion by making it harder to report safely as in ‚Äòuse the app as intended‚Äô by requiring more time and ATTENTION to operate therefore rendering the original intent of the app useless. JMHO üò¢ | I like a lot of things about this app however I hate at the same time and end up not using cause if the phone is connected to my car once I add the address it doesn‚Äôt give me options to see routes available it just starts the navigation straight away and if I want to see the route I need to disconnect the phone while I am lost and driving and it‚Äôs very annoying, on the top off that when I disconnect from the car and  stop the navigation to see the route it immediately erase the address and I have to type all again or reselect the address that sometimes save on history sometimes not‚Ä¶ once again all that nightmare while I am driving!! It would be a better app if it would do like google does! | I like that Waze updates me on police officers and some traffic patterns. But it is extremely dangerous. It changes your patterns while driving shaving one minute off is not really doing me any help and pulling me through 300 additional stops again is not a fair option to choose from

Now, when ask me to change Rt, I had to do it on my car screen instead of my phone, which is even more dangerous and I can‚Äôt figure out the Rt pattern.

I wish there was an option to stop getting routed through neighborhoods. I don‚Äôt want 368. Turns the mental stress and load of that is 10 times worse than just sitting on the highway. For example, no way routing me through downtown Atlanta was better than keeping me on 285 and taking me straight to Smyrna.. Grammatical errors using voice to text | Traveling from Louisiana to Washington, got to the border of New Mexico and Colorado in Raton, when we pulled off to get food. We were traveling north with no issues. Tried to get back on the road and Waze directed us to start traveling south. I noticed pretty fast since all the signs said South I-25, and we turned around, but Waze continued to say we needed to make a uturn and head south. Our eta changed from 8:20pm before the stop to 10pm after. Since it kept telling us to do a compete 180¬∞, I decided to pull up Apple Maps to get directions and when I did it put us on the correct route with the eta being 8:33. So not only was it the complete wrong way and had us backtracking, it wouldn‚Äôt have even got us there faster but 1 and 1/2 hours later. This app is defunked if it can‚Äôt give the right directions, especially if other apps have the same reporting features as this one now. | Been using App for years; had many destinations saved, routes, drives, narrator voices; now, suddenly, with no warning, for no reason, all that info is gone, and I have to start over like the first day!
So disappointed! | Waze has helped me avoid traffic numerous times, but whenever I can‚Äôt avoid it, I add time to my ETA. The app always underestimates how much time you will spend in traffic. | ùïÄùï•'ùï§ ùïõùï¶ùï§ùï• ùïòùï†ùï†ùïï ùïûùï™ ùïóùï£ùïöùïñùïüùïïùï§ ùïíùïùùï§ùï† ùïùùï†ùïßùïñ ùïöùï• ‚ô°‚ù•‚ù¢‚ô•Ô∏é·úä | It‚Äôs so bad | I use the Waze app while traveling for business but my major issue is that it doesn‚Äôt give you a heads up as to what‚Äôs coming‚Ä¶ for example, it would be helpful if the app was able to say ‚Äúat the night light take a right‚Äù OR when I‚Äôm about to take and exit let me know what lane to be in before I actually exit, something like ‚Äúexit right and stay in the left lane‚Äù this way I don‚Äôt exit right and it‚Äôs a split exit with 2 routes to go and I got in the wrong lane which has happened.

I know the screen shows it but what if you can‚Äôt look at the screen because it‚Äôs heavy traffic? 

Just a recommendation. | Waze is one of those rare apps that i will go out of my way to write a review for. This app has saved from about 35 speeding tickets at this point and it‚Äôs the first thing i throw on when i drive. The routes are always efficient and the traffic data seems to be almost as accurate as google maps! I would say the only downside is the battery draw on your phone but if you have a charger and are using carplay, there is nothing to complain about. Would love to be able to mark hazards for other wazers from the other side of the road though! | The ‚Äúwhere to‚Äù disappears too quick when opening the app. | This app was awesome before the last update. The voice alerts for speed traps and red light cameras was great. Since the update, this feature is no longer available. Also, the app accesses your location even when you‚Äôre not using it. Please change everything back to how it was before this AWFUL update. | Waze stays open on my phone after I leave my car for some reason. I have to open it then close it to exit the app. If not caught it will drain battery | I have used Waze for years but finally had to delete this app because it requires location tracking to be enable and actually running at all times.   The only workaround is to disable location services whenever the app is not being used.   Its a shame because its otherwise a great app. | Had iPhone 7, worked great with CarPlay. Was a 5 star app. Upgraded to iPhone 15. Can‚Äôt report hazards, hazards aren‚Äôt announced, can‚Äôt get directions, it‚Äôs totally useless now. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling it, reinstalling it. Forgetting device on CarPlay, etc. can‚Äôt find information on user forums. | I enjoy the accuracy of the app I only wish that when you are arriving at your location, it will actually show the address and a picture of the location. For example, your destination is on the left or the right it literally just drops a pin in the middle of the block and it doesn‚Äôt show you that you‚Äôve arrived at said address it just tells you you‚Äôve arrived, there is no picture there is no address of which you put in. I use Waze a lot with Uber and it never gives me the final destination. I always have to switch over to Uber to see where the house is.",4.84821,2996432,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/5b/c9/a9/5bc9a9bc-a950-2318-c5f0-cde4e336b4bc/8a99ba1c-50e1-4521-bef6-8140db5a9936_Screen_01_Pothole_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ad/cc/14/adcc147a-9629-098a-b90f-9b0a14721ebf/14a15076-4aaa-4b60-839f-4cd9017369bf_Screen_02_Reporting_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a7/21/91/a72191c3-c6b7-4691-7603-21e95a94a4ab/55d76f58-7815-4761-9c38-7e9cb759d817_Screen_03_Reroute_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/80/a4/a9/80a4a938-3bd7-c65a-13e4-c1f6fb2d65cf/41eb45b9-3493-48e0-ae68-95c73de0f2a6_Screen_04_Speed_Camera_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ad/e6/af/ade6af1e-31e9-856d-1204-ef0d622a9b54/2f5bba53-5e4c-4f47-9b4d-b73ca9177305_Screen_05_CYD_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3b/be/4a/3bbe4abc-5994-bc3f-a81a-a7f1c458c0cc/a60ae708-2520-47d0-bbb5-ea55605b121c_01-POTHOLE_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/01/1c/60/011c602b-a7a9-15bf-fa0b-2498a48e62a9/8f7fd96d-60cd-4415-aa5c-d4df8344d960_02-REPORTING_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/75/6b/ec/756bec5a-78df-7348-35b2-1e00740d6c23/d406f30c-6490-4323-8810-525a3d0046e4_03-REROUTE_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f4/87/73/f48773bb-864a-ea1c-018e-2b306c1c4764/86b99d5d-7a60-4ed1-b158-118e40c46dc3_04-SPEED_CAMERA_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4f/6e/86/4f6e860c-9f97-8902-15b7-51bb638353a0/5660ff26-0421-488a-9b67-95ade4ef805f_05-COPILOT_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

It not only allows me to add everything to a quick view schedule, but also allows me to add documents that I normally had to rewrite not notes on other apps. Ir can find your flights, carrier, hotel and resort! All in a nicely laid out interface. I use it on an iPad Mini and it looks awesome. | Setting an itinerary is an exercise in frustration as destination times refuse to save at least 40% of the time. When they do save, the app decides to change dates on relaunch. Needs work. | I love I can organize stuff for myself and collaborate on trips with my wife, and it supports everything. Tours, cruises, restaurants, adding files and photos, everything. And lots of clever features sprinkled throughout. Fantastic app. | I've been using TripIt (Pro) for years, but I've always found its interface cumbersome and confusing. While TripIt's new interface is better, I much prefer Tripsy for all my travel planning and tracking.  

Tripsy's clean visual design is beautiful and efficient. The main screen displays the most essential information for my trip or, when traveling, for the current leg of my journey. Details for any portion of the trip are usually just a click away. Tripsy has all the main features that you'd expect from a travel app, such as multiple ways to gather travel documents into a trip (search email, forward an email, Mac/iOS sharing, etc), integration with device calendars, support for multiple travelers and non-traveling planners, document upload, etc. TripIt still has an edge in integrations with other travel apps or services. I suspect Tripsy will add more partnerships as they grow and develop. If there is something you want or need to do in TripIt, Tripsy has the option to sync from  TripIt automatically. I used this option when I started using Tripsy, which made that initial transition (or even a trial) so much easier because I didn't need to reimport my documents for planned trips. 

Tripsy lost a few points in this review because of a few areas where it took effort to accomplish some tasks. There are some quirks in importing the cruise portion of a trip. Most cruise data was imported without a hitch; however, it didn't grab the departure time for days in port. I tried manually adding the departure times for a day in port, but it was annoyingly complex. I'd open the detail for a particular day, but I needed help figuring out how to add the departure time, or when I did, I could only choose from predetermined times. Eventually, I found that I had to select a predetermined time, save the changes, open the details again, scroll down to the proper date of my trip and then I could finally set the appropriate time. This problem doesn't happen often, but it is currently a pain. 

Overall, though, I love using Tripsy!! It is now my go-to travel app. | It really helps plan trips and only one person needs a subscription for everyone to collaborate in the app for a trip. | overall great program.  needs a slight interface overhaul (each day should be very subtle different color than others to easily differentiate them).  And I would highly recommend a calendar view. | If you have an itinerary already defined, this app may help document it.  But if you're actually planning and exploring options, it will get slow you down and make a mess in your calendar database.  Also, I got billed for a month even though I cancelled quickly. | Here are my issues so far-- 1) Multiple times, the entries I have put in and saved change on their own. Train times, for instance, will modify themselves to whatever they want (right now I have a train entry that leaves at 8:42PM and arrives at 8:42PM, despite putting in the accurate times). It is not a time change issue, either, they're just random times and AM/PM. This is very annoying and I'm about to give up on this tool. 2) We're flying halfway across the world and you have to scroll to see the map entirely, no way to zoom out and show the whole trip on the screen. You can zoom in...but you can't zoom out to show Florida and Australia on the same map screen. 3) I subscribed to a monthly plan and was surprised to have recently been charged for a year's access. It just seems like ""Save"" doesn't mean what you think it does in this app. I was really excited to get organized, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere, like TripIt. | Unable to even put in dated. Date Screen does not scroll to find the correct month. Figures a work around but once I put in the ending date, the program changes the start date so the trip is ony 1 day....unless I set the trip up without dates but it is difficult to add places for the new days. | Â¶ÇÊûúÂä†‰∏äÊØèÊÆµË°åÁ®ãËä±Ë¥πÂ§öÂ∞ëÈí±Ëøô‰∏™ÂäüËÉΩÂ∞±Êõ¥Â•Ω‰∫Ü | Tried to change to this because I was over trip it. Not pulling in the text from the email and when I search for what I need it keeps showing something in the wrong country. No thanks. Making my life harder | This product can do more to help plan for your vacation than the free platforms. Both this company and apple customer service are unwilling to listen and help resolve my issue with this platform. | This is a great travel planner APP. It works very well and is reliable. Their customer service is excellent as well. If you are looking for a travel planner APP with a lifetime purchase, just try this one! | I am offering 4-stars in this review solely based on the apps' potential and the current user interface design friendliness. The apps' current state and functionality is actually about a 2-star. I hope to update this review shortly to full 5-star based on some things getting taken care of.
Easier itinerary control - went to manually add (I didn't have easy access to the email), a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport for an early flight, and I couldn't do that because the app had already defined the trip as Thursday to Tuesday based on the flight, with me trying to add a Wednesday ""activity"". I had to go into the settings for the itinerary and change the beginning date. (A further annoyance, rather than just changing one date, once I set the new start, it also required the ending, rather than keeping it on the same by default. There should be a way when adding an activity to go ‚Äúoutside the dat boundary‚Äù and have the app automatically update the overall itinerary timeframe.
Side-note to above‚Ä¶ The share-to-Tripsy function in the Hilton app only brought hotel name and phone number, not the booked dates, res# or other actual booking details - another potential fix? I don‚Äôt know if that is Tripsy not importing correctly, or Hilton not exporting & sharing properly.
Better functionality required for the planning part of a trip. Right now, this app just kind of ‚Äúcatches‚Äù all the emails you forward it (or painfully add in manually). When you think of booking a trip, say a vacation getaway, there are many pieces to it (the very reason for this app). Resort, flights, transport from airport to resort, excursions while there, maybe a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport with park-and-fly arrangements. Not all that stuff is booked at once. So being able to easily add in each aspect that needs to be booked, and then have each of those activity icons color-coded on the itinerary page (ie. Red for needs booking, yellow for booked, green for booked and pre-paid) really is necessary. Being able to manually change the color of each activity icon would be a simple step. More complex would be adding in 2 checkboxes in the activity (or right-click / hold-click pop up menu) to indicate when it is booked and when it is paid. Next level of complexity would be for the app to automatically color code based on the details provided in the activity (company and res # fields filled out automatically determines ‚Äúbooked‚Äù status, I‚Äôm not sure how it would determine paid).
 
Again, overall I like the direction this app is going, but it really needs these updates to become the true ‚ÄúGo-To Travel Planner‚Äù. Currently, it is leagues beyond it‚Äôs main competitor. Enough that I subscribed to Pro for a year. But without these necessary changes, that subscription will not get extended. Yes, those changes are that necessary, and without them I will go back to Excel and OneNote to manage all my travel, as the app would be missing the ‚Äúease‚Äù functionality that it should have vs. a more manual process.
Hopefully the devs read this and put these ideas in place very soon. I am sure they have a ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù, but for true traveler functionality, these need to be inserted in the immediate stages of that roadmap.
Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!!! | Several of my trips that are complete on one device are showing up as one-day trips on days where I don‚Äôt have travel planned. For example, if I have a trip planned from 11-17 March, the trip shows up as 25-25 March on other devices and shared links. None of the activities are syncing across devices. Reached out to support several weeks ago but haven‚Äôt heard back and the issue still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. Just know that paying for the premium features is worth it when it works, but if it stops working you‚Äôll be dealing with awful customer support. I‚Äôve also never been able to get the import function to work. I like the interface though. | Âú∞ÂõæÂèØ‰ª•Â¢ûÂä†È´òÂæ∑ÂíåÁôæÂ∫¶ÂêóÔºü‰ª•ÂèäÊùøÂùóÂ¶ÇÊûúÂèØ‰ª•Ëá™ÂÆö‰πâÂ∞±Â•Ω‰∫ÜÔºåÊØîÂ¶ÇÊàëÔºåÂè™ÊÉ≥Áî® app Êî∂ÈõÜÈ§êÈ¶Ü„ÄÇÊóÅËæπÁöÑËØÅ‰ª∂ÂØπÊàëÊù•ËØ¥Ê≤°‰ªÄ‰πàÁî®„ÄÇÊàëÁõ∏‰ø°ÊúâËøôÊ†∑ÈúÄÊ±ÇÁöÑ‰∫∫‰πü‰∏çÂ∞ë„ÄÇ

""Can maps include options for Amap (È´òÂæ∑) and Baidu (ÁôæÂ∫¶)? Additionally, it would be great if users could customize categories. For example, I might only want to use the app to collect information about restaurants, and licenses nearby are not relevant to me. I believe there are many users with similar needs."" | A great app that keeps all your travel plans in one place. A suggestion - would you please consider adding a feature that allows me to set to-do reminders for my trip? It would would be so helpful to be able to set a reminder then later received a push notification. Thank you!! | I was a long time TripIt user and Tripsy is better in every way imaginable | I had been searching for a good itinerary app ever since Google Trips shut down years ago. Tripsy is the best one I've used since then. The auto-import by email (for flights, hotels, cars etc) works great and has only gotten more reliable over the year I've been using it. The iOS and Mac apps are both super easy to use and visually appealing. | have you considered adding a ""packing list"" feature for our trips? | This is a great app. I have used it on multiple trips and I can‚Äôt live without it now. The only thing missing is that I would like a way to keep a packing list with a quantity field. So I can always make sure I have everything ready prior to a trip and before a return. | Sadly, was hoping this would be app that might work to share itinerary with other humans traveling with me without them having to buy. Nope. Also, had to manually enter 4 of 6 flts and 1 hotel. Even when trying to share from hotel app to create event had to manually enter data. All of this would be fine but when share itinerary with others it does not provide any details (times of flights, flt #, resv etc | Just got it and it provides no guidance as to how to use the app, how to upload reservations; adding guests seems impossible.... | This app is pretty good and very helpful. However I wish the native Mac app felt more Mac-like. As it is, it feels very much like a big iPhone app. I was hoping that planning my trip and making adjustments would have been much easier on my Mac, but I feel the UI and workflow is very limited since it feels like it is a scaled up iPhone app that does not adequately take advantage of the Mac. It is very good, but I wish it could better take advantage of what the Mac can allow for productivity! | Good app and looking forward to using it for future trips.  Would greatly appreciate a field for cost/expense.  We like to work withina budget and this would greatly help. | Searching and adding a flight is too clunky, taking too many steps. The whole UI feels huge like the buttons are massive, but it doesn't make it more usable. You can have different dates than your flights and it doesn't auto update the actual trip dates. You can accidentally add the same flight twice. Buttons aren't labeled, making the intended flow unclear. Basically feels like a more manual version of Kayak, since I'm not paying for the pro version so I can't do email sync. | I download Mac App and iPhone app. At first I ran into problem where the trip from Mac app does not sync. I email support and the Co-Founder responded to me and help diagnose the issue really fast. In face I never had this fast response from app developer before. And the step to diagnose and communication this is straightforward and sincere.

Apart from that, the app has intuitive user interface and easy to understand and can sync with multiple devices and with friends whom I shared the trip with. This eliminated the need to manually create initerary, which reduce times and free us to explore the activities instead. | Wowww. What a good travel app. Very easy going and with all the information and set up for the best experience travel management | I decided to try the app out because I'm looking for an app that can handle travel planning and has a nice UI, which this one does. 

However I noticed while creating an account that the form fields aren't labeled correctly so you can't auto-generate a password from Keychain.This is coming from a developer so I know how easy it is to integrate those small security features in form fields. This was the first red flag. 

So I made a temporary password and I thought I'd change it afterwards to a more secure password, but there's no option to change my password in the app? I read the other reviews about the support being non-existent, along with the developer not responding to feedback in the app store reviews makes me not trust the construction of this app, or being able to get basic support if something goes wrong (keep in mind this app has paid features). I just deleted the app after deleting my account. | The interface is beautiful but the actual implementaion is terrible. Tried several times to add an event and itinerary and it never showed up. I might have even duplicated the subscription in trying to fix the issue. My reccomendation is to go with TripIt. Not as pretty but it works. | Pro user here for a few years now. I absolutely love the planning aspect but the number of unresolved bugs is incredibly frustrating. Support is nonexistent, you won‚Äôt get an answer for weeks. There are issues with timezones, findings things, flight schedules, sync and many others. Each update breaks something. I am really unhappy at this point and will not renew our subscription next year. | A really solid travel organization app. All the nice features you want. If you travel it‚Äôs easily worth the subscription price. | I love this app and use it constantly. It has been a game changer for me. Very much appreciate the regular improvements. | I would have probably signed up for the paid service and enjoyed the app. However, I found a charge on my card via my apple account before ever using the app. Canceled subscription. | I have used this app twice this year - a two week trip to Spain, and a five week road trip of the east coast of the united states.  In both cases, I found myself a slave to the app. The cost of setting up parts of a trip, in terms of effort, was much greater than the benefit I got from it. I put this app in a drawer and only pulled it out occasionally. I am happy to let this infernal subscription expire until I MAYBE want to use it again in two years.

I like the app, kinda. It looked good at first. It is good at organizing itineraries, as long as those itinerary are AirBnB and organized tours and have a rigid order that will NEVER change. Other parts of my travel plan, like mapping, seem forced and clunky. I had to find ways to do these outside this app.

After a while I started treating this app as a wallet that held a collection of ideas. Adding and removing things from the itinerary took WAY too much effort. Items simply didn't like to move.

I guess I am not their target market. It is too much of a marginal benefit for me keep paying for. It would be worth a fixed charge with paid upgrades, but this is in no way such a life-changing app that I want to keep paying and paying for it. A folder with a collection of links and copies of my reservations works just as well.

Subscription cancelled. | It does not sync with phone and laptop and my phone is missing trips that i put on my laptop!
PLEASE FIX BECAUSE I LOVE THIS APP IF IT WOULD SIMPLY JUST DO THAT | I've been looking for something like Tripsy for a long time.  the closest thing has been tripit but Tripsy seems setup to add the functionality to be the travel suite everyone will use.  It does a pretty good job parsing emails but my AirBB reserveration didnt work. There doesnt seem to be an option for it monitor emails automatically.   It would be nice to be able to drag items from one day/time to another.   The search functionality for new evetns works well.   I love the map feature.  The whole app is worth it for this feature.    Support has been super responsive.  I'm looking forward to growing with them.  Finally theyre doing what no one else could. | I only see, weekly, monthly and yearly as option but not lifetime | Such a great app - but I wish it had 2 small things:

1. The ability to hide flight paths on the map view. I dont want the map to always default to a zoomed out view that doesn‚Äôt show many much relevant detail of the stuff I have planned in my actual destination 

2. The ability to add a location to the itinerary on a certain day, without having to assign it a specific time. I.e. ‚ÄúI want to go here on the second day of my trip, but I don‚Äôt care specifically when‚Äù | love all of the features, email forwarding, gate upates and overall viewpoints. great updates. | I love this app.  It has transformed how I travel!!  I tried out several different apps before finding Tripsy, but Tripsy has the best user interface.  The ability to view everything on the map has been so helpful when deciding what activity to do next based on proximity.  My only suggestion for improvement would be being able to create custom categories or activities.  Sometimes I‚Äôd like to be more specific than just something like ‚Äúfitness,‚Äù especially if we are doing lots fitness type activities in a single trip (golfing, hiking, etc). | I think I tried almost every group travel planning app in the store and on the web, and Tripsy is by far the best for group leisure travel planning. It handles all the fundamentals of planning a trip gracefully and intuitively, without the clutter and noise so prevalent in this category. 

I can think of a few nonessential features that Tripsy lacks, like expense tracking, shared check-lists, and ability to add notes to a date.

But Tripsy delivers on the fundamentals of travel planning ‚Äì which all work seamlessly and intuitively to provide a great user experience ‚Äì in a way that no other app currently does. Highly recommend! | Would not use anyone else! | Setting up two activities in a single day seems to be impossible | Definitely will continue to use this app. I love the in app map feature, makes it so easy to get to places. | I love the app, I used it for my trips with my friends. | I think the developer poured a lot of thought and effort into the app and I do believe that for other travelers it is a worthwhile investment if you need all your travel info in one place and shareable. That said you need not look further because this app has it all. Flights, hotels, and general itinerary management is great! I used the email function and the hit rate was pretty good. A couple hotel bookings didn‚Äôt go through but they were formatted oddly even for human reading so that is certainly not the fault of the ingest system. For standard booking (major airlines and chain hotels) flights and hotels it worked flawlessly. I really appreciated the sharing feature, I had the other family on the trip download the app and they were able to see and add to the itinerary, which was excellent. Overall a well executed app and it is probably well fitting if you need all your travel info in one app that you can share with others.

Post trip update: I want to continue using the app, but after having it for a trip we just didn‚Äôt need to use the functionality - I think I‚Äôm more organized already and it was a chore to move everything to the app rather than just use our existing calendar and weather apps. Also, I think based on the fact I already use Flighty for real-time flight notifications that extra feature wasn‚Äôt needed for me so  I turned off the flight info for the trip. For me it‚Äôs just not something I can see using, THAT SAID, the execution is great and it deserves 5 stars even if it doesn‚Äôt fit my use case. Excellent work, a pleasure to use. | What an app. Blows TripIt out of the water. Always updating and adding new features. Thanks! | When entering a hotel the dates are not visible. Also when changing the dates on an item it reverts back to the old date. These bugs are fixed then appear again. | Every single flight, hotel reservation, excursion conveniently located in one place chronologically. This app is a dream for anyone that wants to be organized or has a busy trip scheduled. Fabulous app, I just can‚Äôt say enough about it! I would recommend to all!",4.69581,2482,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/de/66/36/de663688-50da-18eb-7677-e1757c2bc564/b0c64060-a08f-4bdb-befe-6ae55a286ef2_Intro.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ce/4e/c1/ce4ec1e6-a492-0640-03fa-7cbe1d70de48/207fd846-6a09-47bd-83f0-aabf78dcd12c_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5a/af/b5/5aafb59a-5d6d-61c5-5461-bd421c7556d3/3177ddd7-5fcc-4b30-9c78-f84e8607d000_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/25/1c/39/251c3975-fe25-3d67-54ff-1f382fe07b89/e473061d-29cc-4c2f-8e0b-2d5fbda5a1d8_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8f/26/7f/8f267fa1-5949-5453-85fa-3abad08a7dfb/a1bd7e9f-4eb1-4b59-b153-0caea448b4ea_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d3/9a/49/d39a49aa-fa53-705e-b753-dad78596af57/0ca3eaf4-636a-4588-b444-50d8aa2757b9_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/70/36/6f/70366f2d-b6c8-0bda-d6cf-35170ea52bb0/46188ed7-9da8-4b34-a972-d54f6fd713f4_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e7/84/ee/e784ee37-e856-ff7e-965c-3d7087e03177/614e4fd7-7be1-4fde-b4ad-1d2b6fd2e518_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/83/ee/5c/83ee5ce9-6a8f-117d-a178-6c10eacbaed0/20212e44-be53-45b8-83c5-80f1cb2f1f6a_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/37/04/27/370427e4-2f79-9776-b9f2-4111bbe25c5d/2742267b-eb37-4994-9d89-1da274b3ec0b_9.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4b/8f/01/4b8f01a6-e6e3-48eb-aceb-646e8e5dd424/06fe8bf6-b49a-41e0-b0e3-a2ec692fe4cf_1@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/47/43/21/474321b2-754b-1651-eae2-931c3f6887f6/955359a3-58d3-466b-901b-101615151c74_2@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/9f/24/af/9f24af1d-5542-9f10-47a0-f1ed471933ae/13842535-6533-4792-808c-eb6f0aca2891_3@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/37/fa/21/37fa215c-aadf-b625-a4f8-7ba0b7a3dcca/d007491b-4ef7-4a2a-a568-4b784d1f1e59_4@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0e/1a/1c/0e1a1c6e-bfa8-42e0-023a-8a22603add84/9a11790d-5779-4bbd-a463-6dc068e50d67_5@2x.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6f/cc/ba/6fccba70-6e17-7d9b-1fc2-48a3c13b8752/b2856dab-11f0-4895-bb05-43c383649946_6@2x.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iP

This company needs to go under, they have no way of cancelling a flight within 24 hours of booking. Instead it‚Äôs only an ‚Äúapplication‚Äù for cancellation and even then it‚Äôs not a full refund.

We literally got notified hours before the first leg of our flight was cancelled and our full trip was unrefundable despite not being able to make our connection.. we got scripted responses from customer support telling us to reach out to the airlines ourselves and now we‚Äôre out hundreds of dollars‚Ä¶ absolute nightmare | Just keep in mind if you ever would need to a change in passenger name or whatever they will charge you for additional service, will keep telling automated replies‚Äùthank you for your patience‚Äù but won‚Äôt be able to solve your issue, because they have lots of greyish ticketing offices in the world whose are actually responsible for your booking, but don‚Äôt now their location and phone numbers. Also they will offer you 0 refund.  Terrible attitude and service! | Selected hotel on google maps, then selected and downloaded trip.com ‚Äî automatically placed most expensive hotels in front of my face and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù hotel I was trying to book. Bozos | It was so easy to book my stay at this historic hotel through Trip.com. The price offered was reasonable. I got a rate with breakfast included! Enjoyed the hotel stay and thanks to this platform! | ÊòØÊàëÊóÖË°åÁöÑÂ•ΩÂπ´Êâã | Garbage app. They screwed up my dates and then wouldn‚Äôt refund my money and blamed the hotel. Called the hotel and they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything because it was through a third party. Don‚Äôt use this, go literally anywhere else | Your first choice to travel all of the world | For hotels they charge you a deposit and tell you what you should pay at the hotel. The price you pay at the hotel is no where near close to what they tell you the price it‚Äôs. They do not disclose any fees the hotels may have and they do not advertise them until after you check out and then you can cancel even tho they changed the price. | Very bad app | Is very good and very easy üòò | Need use it i Thailand for cheap price | Hello, I signed up for a flight with my previously filled in credentials, and for some reason trip did not transfer my middle name when they bought the tickets. Because of this I allost missed my flight, as it didn‚Äôt match my passport information and China requires a middle name. The agent I talked to refused to change it, and they also refused to talk to the airline receptionist, to come to a reasonable and timely solution. Instead, they told me to cancel my flight- mid transfer, pay a fee of 90$, and then rebook a more expensive and later flight. I was waiting to board my flight, and I had already paid and everything told me not to do this, because it was unreasonable. The app wouldn‚Äôt let me manually change the information, even after 4 requests, it rejected them saying the airline disallowed it, even though the receptionist had given me specific directions of contacting trip to change it, so I knew the airline was actually fine with this. This was absurd, to be left without a flight despite the ‚Äòcancellation insurance‚Äô and really hurt the app for future flight purposes for me. | We booked a flight that required a connection. The airline changed one segment to a day later, but not the other segment because Trip.com booked the segments separately. It took us 30 hours to complete a 4-hour flight, and we lost a day of the tour we had paid for, and we had to book a hotel for a night at the layover. Now, the App doesn‚Äôt even find our flights. | I wouldn't recommend this app. Bought a plane ticket through here and the airline didn't provide the services as stated and when I made a claim through the app, they backed the airline. Tired of being used and abused by companies doing whatever they want to the consumer. It's extra bad when it comes to airplane travel. | We booked for 3 nights, offered to pay for the first night, even though the hotel had no aircon, tv, working shower. It literally didn‚Äôt even have a reception area. Had to ask other guests to find the manager. It took like 2 days to get refunded for the last 2 nights. Agoda or Booking is much better. This company should be banned from the internet. | ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | App a bit difficult to manuever but customer service, even if AI is excellent. My trip went smoothly because Wheelchair service was set up for me. I was so grateful and so much stress was lifted from my mind.

Otherwise I cannot select seats for flight and order special meals. I am vegetarian and I was not offered the option, through this site or Thai airways site, to get my meal preference. 

This is not good service, not even cheaper than booking directly. 

Disappointed and you will lose customers. | Â§ßÊï∞ÊçÆÊùÄÁÜüÔºå‰π∞ÂÆåÊú∫Á•®Á¨¨‰∫åÂ§©Êü•ËØ¢Â∞±Èôç‰ª∑ÔºåÊâìÁÆóÂà†Èô§app | Customer service is nothing will not assist when unreasonable involuntary changes are made to your booking . This website engages in predatory practices | I used this app alot when it comes to booking hotel and flights‚Ä¶ this app give me some great deals on hotel, flight‚Ä¶ also benefit like free loughe every calendar year when u made enough booking‚Ä¶ the only thing i didnt like when √≠t comes to flight booking, √≠t doesnt give u instant confirmation, u gotta wait couple hours, sometime 1-2 days to get ur flight confirmed‚Ä¶. Other than that everything was easy to use on this app, its fun when u can do some challenges and get rewards for it too‚Ä¶ i mostly use this app for all my booking from now on‚Ä¶ | This app is great because it‚Äôs a one stop shop for all things travel related. The layout and design is also user friendly. Will definitely recommend. | Avoid this app. They cancel your trip one day before and do not help in anything | I recently made multiple bookings on Trip.com.  They sent me emails for each of the bookings.  However, these same bookings do NOT a show up on my trips bookings.  There is no option to type in the booking number to view my hotel.  They require a PIN number which was not included in the email.  When I went through an agent, they said they would update my bookings. They never did. 
Now I am unable to retrieve my bookings.  
Would not recommend this site. | Must have app for travel to Asia; better hotel selection and better prices than other top travel apps. | This app stinks!  They issue tickets in the wrong name of the passenger.

I won‚Äôt waste anymore time on this site. | 3 weeks ago I bought 3 return tickets with this application with the insurance of flexible date changing for the flight, and i paid 35$ for each insurance and at the time of selling the insurance for me, they were saying that all costs of the flight date changing will be only 135$ at anytime before departure. Since last 3 days i have been talked plenty of time with the customer service and they wasted too much time and at the end they ask me 940$ for the flight date changing even though they sold me the flexible flight date insurance. And their excuse is that insurance was not covering the fare and taxes, so what does an insurance means then? They scammed me so badly and they are just wasting the time. Please never ever trust on this app. Is not trustworthy specially for people in the USA. I have proofs and screenshots how they are scamming.

This is the spot hotel.com is the bomb | Stayed 2 nights here. Thought it would be decent because says Wyndham. I guess it‚Äôs ok for single guy on a work layover. Room smelled of weed , multiple paint touchups never finished , holes in bathroom door frame, vinyl floors very dirty , front door never sealed properly letting air in, tv didn‚Äôt work , air conditioner worked but sounded like a diesel truck engine.

I called to costumer service to ask for a refund, Dominic help me out and he told me ‚Äúsometime we made some kinds of exception for cases like yours‚Äù, after 1hr waiting on hold, he told me that unfortunately they can‚Äôt do anything so my reservation still on. I asked to speak to a manager and they hung me up. 1st experience has been REALLY BAD!!!!!!!!!! | Awesome deals on a wide variety of hotels. Get the best deals on the hotels you would usually stay at! Highly recommended, use this every time we plan a trip out of town!! | Worked fine for 3 hotels on my travel and then wouldn‚Äôt accept my payments and wouldn‚Äôt sent a recovery email. I do NOT recommend this at all. It will be a complete let down. | The booking when smooth as always, but my hotel room 879 was lousy, the service room for cleaning wasn‚Äôt good at all, no garbages bags, the jets on the jacuzzi weren‚Äôt working , we wanted a king size bed  and we got a double bed room and the worst air conditioner was not working to top it off! | We have booked in the past with Hotel Tonight, and never had any problems.  However, this booking did not seem to transfer to Comfort Inn correctly.  They had our reservation, but said they did not get paid from Hotel Tonight?  We had to wait over 1/2 hour while they contacted Hotel Tonight/Expedia.  They were nice enough to give us a room, but didn‚Äôt get it settled with Hotel Tonight until morning. | DO NOT RECOMMEND! 

Arrived at the hotel after getting confirmation from Hotel Tonight. Front desk showed me a message they sent 5 days before they were fully booked. 

The worst problem is that I called Hotel Tonight and no one answered.  Straight to message that told me to email them. I will never use again. | Stayed there one night and it was lovely.
Just saw the opportunity to stay there again and jumped on it. | Great selections - across the board for every budget | I have used Hotel Tonight many times. They do a great job of finding good hotels at a great value.  Even the desk clerks will say ‚Äúwow great rate‚Äù.   In the past perfect for last minute selection and short term planing. But now you can book several months in advance so it‚Äôs even better for longer term trips. | Legit the best way to live on the road üôå | I been using this app for a few years now and it works perfectly, and the discountsüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ | Saved me $ | Service is great. Location is not ideal but on a metro line. Room is clean. Only negative, The pool is not heated and the size of a triangle hot tub. | This such a great app | I booked the room for February 23-24. I‚Äôm getting to the hotel and they see that they booked me for next week. I called them and I told him about it. They didn‚Äôt want to  cancel it or change the date. They are scammers and i had to book again. But I promise I will never use you again. | It is very difficult to verify room type and or search for rooms based on occupancy | Would not allow me to cancel when the hotel I supposedly booked has not answered my 6 phone calls in the past 2 days to address my concerns.  I don‚Äôt feel comfortable driving 2 1/2 hrs to a destination where I can‚Äôt even speak to someone first. | I booked a hotel by mistake and I request a refund afterwards. Hotel tonight worked hard on that and they considered my fault and refunded me in the same day. This is a such trustworthy company and website. Thank you so much‚Ä¶

I would like to give a big thanks for Snibika, Sam and Kieth for all the support and refund | Scours the internet for great hotel deals. Love the daily drop feature and overal ease of use. Never had a bad stay using. | It never works! Why is this app still broken? | Positive: clean, updated carpet, tile, wallpaper. Fwy very close. Negative: very thin walls-could hear next door conversations through the wall, shower next door just like it was in your room, middle of winter and 1 thin summer weight comforter. Had to call for a blanket. Also, laundry room backed up to our room on opposite wall, operating past 9PM. | I never book a room anywhere without first checking HT. They‚Äôre always cheaper than any other option. | For the second time, the rate charged at the hotel was much less than what I paid through Hotel Tonight. The lady at the front desk laughed when she found out what I paid. I hate playing the fool. | I like the convenience. I do feel pricing could be better vs Priceline or other but all good. The platform works. | This hotel lacked cleanliness. Every threshold in the hotel is filthy. Not sure if they bleach the towels. They were very dingy. | I use this app so much, for last minute stays and planning future stays. The deals are amazing! And, the loyalty program gets better the more you use it‚Ä¶deeper discounts, rewards, referral bonuses. Great product all around! | Its very simple to use, with some really great deals! Especially during the week. If you book a Friday or Saturday just a couple days in advance you‚Äôll find some really great deals too. If its a last minute thing, you‚Äôll still be surprised how affordable these hotels can be. During the week ive gotten rooms for less than $90 bucks. Just be sure to call the hotel before you arrive and ask if they charge you a refundable deposit. (Most are a $50 refundable deposit). But this app has been delivered on everything it promised. | This third party sets you up to think your getting a good deal, but you are getting screwed. The charge on this app is not the final charge. You get charged at the hotel for way more than the discount you pay this third party app.  NO REFUNDS OR OPTIONS FROM HOTEL WITH THIS THIRD PARTY APP.

why can‚Äôt i just see the reviews on the website oh my goodness!!!!!! insanely stupid | If I could give 0 stars I would. This place uses reheated food. The food I ordered was spoiled. On top of that they didn‚Äôt even give me everything i paid for. I tried to get refunded and they denied to refund me my money. They also discriminate against black people. This place needs to be put out of business ASAP. | Love reading the reviews and giving mine too. Platform is super user friendly and I enjoy it. | Everything was suuuuper delicious!! Especially the grilled beef salad! | Amazing | They came out to install my EV charger, it felt so good having an installer come out that was knowledgeable and respectful. Smooth install process, permitting and final inspection went so smoothly. They took care of everything, and the communication was out of this world! They texted and emailed when they were on the way, was able to effortlessly look at  and approve my estimate from the palm of my hands. They gave me 2 budget friendly options with no sales pressure! Bella is a great company to work with, already talking with one of their project managers for my smart panel upgrade project. So smooth! Thanks to my installer Juan! | Such great service. Quick & precise! | Yelp | I‚Äôve seen lots of good reviews for places I like be taken down for no reason. There has been a total of 5 people I know of who wrote a 5 star review only to be taken down to make room for the bad ones. Dumb and stupid. üëé | Yelp is very helpful. Kind of my go to if I don‚Äôt already know what I‚Äôm looking for. | Great place for spring break | Keep getting error pages when nothing else in my phone is acting up. I can‚Äôt do anything on app | Had a wonderful meal but upset. When our 3 couples made reservations for last Friday night they never shared that they didn‚Äôt take credit cards. We we‚Äôre scrambling for money. They should people when they make reservations. Will not go back until they do. 
Camilla Winterland | Yelp is being a way to bring us new costumer‚Äôs every day.
Very loyal people and very responsible.
Used to be free app but now, people are searching for money, and doesn‚Äôt show your business without paying a price üòîü§® | I was there to see the Peabody ducks and my brother said I MUST eat here. i Went down the alley across from the hotel and ordered what was suggested when 2 employees made their recommendations!!!
Combo of dry rubbed pork ribs (lots of meat) and beef brisket - yum!  The baked beans ( coincidentally, I‚Äôm assigned baked beans for Easter brunch for 36- sure wish I had their recipe - best ever)
And copycats out there?  I bought a jar of sauce! And i i also loved the crunchy vinegar mustard Cole slaw. Great waiter, great service. Great local beer on tap. 5 stars. 'Nuf said!!! | Forcing me to use an app just to see pictures is insanity. You know what can also show pictures? A responsive website in mobile Safari. I hope whichever PM decided to juice app download numbers by withholding functionality from the website got a nice promotion. | Outstanding app | Ordered a drink that was poorly made; asked them to exchange drink for a beer; they refused to remove the charge for the poorly made drink from my order. The food was average and there are too many choices in Doral to eat there again. | Food was good. Service was polite and pleasant, but not attentive. Had to go to the bar to get my wine‚Ä¶ and again on a separate trip, to get my wife an iced tea refill.  There were only two parties in the entire restaurant?  Management should be aware and train to rectify. | Love yelp! Always use this to find amazing restaurants. | So easy to use and is a great way to explore F&B for an area you know nothing about. Live how it logs what you have tried as well! | Thank you for restricting my use of your website by forcing me to download your horrid app. I hate you and I tell all my friends I do too | Outstanding breakfast. Highly recommend it. Food and service is exceptional. Proportions are generous. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. | They allow fake reviews from no customers to leave bad reviews. Even if you can prove you didn‚Äôt sell to them or that everything they have said is a lie. There for they contribute to slander and allow it to happen. I will be reporting the to the better business bureau for their crappy service and policies!! | It won‚Äôt let me post reviews or load pages half the time. I try and post a review I have in drafts and it says ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt changed your review‚Äù, I shouldn‚Äôt need to change my review to hit post - it‚Äôs in my drafts, not posted yet! Seems like a bad bug. 

‚ÄúSomething went Wrong‚Äù on every page, and it‚Äôs not a wifi issue‚Ä¶ | Why all local?, so I go to another town and can‚Äôt find the restaurant due it being far away??!!! | One of these days I will become a yelp elite star | I agree Ashley Furniture is not a good place to buy furniture from they are worthless and they do not stand by their agreement. | You receive a lot of food for your money.  The food is awesome! | Why force us to keep downloading the app to look at a menu that can just be easily accessible if you didn‚Äôt! Seriously why?! If you just made the picture accessible without getting the app there wouldn‚Äôt be an issue but you give us a hard time just to look at garbage pictures that don‚Äôt help! | El Sabor De Puebla finally brings outstanding authentic Mexican Food to SW Florida. Just can‚Äôt say enough about the food and service‚Ä¶and the Choriqueso appetizer‚Ä¶.Unbelievable! Carnitas‚Ä¶.Stop it! Too good! | I use the Yelp app a lot and write reviews often, unfortunately this platform deletes my reviews. I think they charge businesses money to remove unwanted reviews. I recommend finding an alternative to this platform | Highly recommend Danny! He diagnosed the problem from a picture and came out and fixed my toilet within the hour! Will definitely be giving him a call next time I‚Äôm in need of a plumber! | Im having so much fun , I was always a Foodie 
Love all kinds of food American , Ghanaian , Filipino , Chinese,  Caribbean etc‚Ä¶.  I always wanted to write about my experiences and now I am. Love that I get to meet new and interesting people from around the world. So Im looking forward to sharing my experiences and thoughts . | I met the entire family one day as I entered this lovely shop. They had great customer service, and we‚Äôre very friendly! Great food! Will definitely be coming back! | The app will delete your reviews if they are not positive feedback people want to know where to spend or not waste their money on lousy service. | they never delivered my order and they never responded to several emails i wrote never responded to voicemail  what kind of customer service is this? take your money and don‚Äôt deliver the goods. | I bought 3 x 2 day tickets to tour London and after 2 stops a supervisor would not let me back on.  I had not caused any problems or created any safety concerns.  In fact the ramp on the last bus was not operating and we gladly lifted my scooter on.  He stated safety concerns with using my electric scooter on their buses which have handicapped parking spots on the bus.  He stated that they allow e-wheel chairs but not my scooter and the spots were for prams. I am unable to walk very far and this is my mode of transport that allows me to enjoy touring.  I am apauled that they would have such an outdated policy of denying access to their services based on my chosen mode of transport .  I ride public transport all the time and have no safety concerns.  Shame on you Big Bus! | Bad app doesn‚Äôt tell truth | Borderline unusable | I recently ordered a vegetable lasagna from Pepperoni Grill.

It was phenomenal ‚ÄºÔ∏è The lasagna was chock full of many different vegetables and the incorporated into the tastiest lasagna‚ù£Ô∏è It was SO DELICIOUS and SO BEAUTIFUL ‚ÄºÔ∏è The staff was very helpful and put the hot lasagna into my car‚ù£Ô∏èI appreciate how helpful and caring they all were‚ù£Ô∏è Thank you, Mike, for making my special occasion even more special ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëè | I love the app as a hole and how there‚Äôs so much to do on it. I just wish that there was some clarity with navigation and user interface.

An example would be a clear cut way to add photos after you added a review somewhere. And a search bar that‚Äôs easier to find instead of hidden. | This place is the BEST. Each time I've visited I've been greeted warmly by the most friendly staff ever. Then there's the coffee. Always on point. Always strong enough and hot enough. Finding a total win like Fueling Station is teuly a treat. Beautiful neighborhood gem! | I tried to have breakfast here on Monday, March 25 at 9:30 in the morning. I walked in and there were two women working there having a conversation. She acknowledged me when I walked in and said she‚Äôd be with me in a second. She continued her conversation while I stood there by myself, the restaurant was completely empty, except for one other table out on the patio. A little irritating me too, but I continue to wait to be seated. She finally came over and seated me, she didn‚Äôt bother to ask me if I would like to be inside or outside, handed me a menu that was pretty wrinkled and you could tell had been through a lot of wear and tear. I should mention at this point that the restaurant is adorable!! A great atmosphere, really cute. Also has a patio. I sat there long enough to look at the menu, figure out what I wanted to have and place the menu down, at this point no one has come to the table to offer a drink or anything. The women are still having their conversation. There‚Äôs also a note on the menu that states that it‚Äôs farm table and you should enjoy yourself and if you don‚Äôt have time to be patient, you should come back another time when you do. I assumed this applied to how long the food would take to make not how long it would take for someone to come over and offer to take my order. I decided to leave as I was walking out the women gave me a quizzical look and I said I don‚Äôt wanna interrupt your conversation. I‚Äôll just go somewhere else for breakfast. She did not try to stop me or apologize. It‚Äôs really unfortunate because it‚Äôs a super cute place. | My go to for alll reviews. | I am STILL in the Emergency Room waiting for a bed on the Medical Floor. I have been waiting since Friday. Please understand that I understand that this area of the hospital is busy, loud and very fast paced. I‚Äôm so uncomfortable, upset and angry that I can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt get the service that I need. What needs to happen is Quality Assurance and Management needs to give them a visit along with the Department of Health. The desk area where what I thought was real doctors who would assist when needed, sits there talking loudly about what they can‚Äôt do for the patients, versus what they can do, about what school they attended and car insurance‚Ä¶NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME BACK TO THIS HOSPITAL FOR ANYTHING. What a disappointment. | These guys are awesome. If you need help getting and staying clean, Buddy‚Äôs Ranch will help you every step of the way. They are right there to help and guide you.

Once we finally got to Schipol in Amsterdam. My husband helped a lady with 3 small children get off the train. The Eurostar staff sat and watched while my husband used the weight of his body to stop the train doors from closing while this poor mom tried to get her family off the train. Why on earth would you have staff who sits there and laughs. Absolutely mortified as this transpired. No one was willing to help. My husband is now bruised and I‚Äôm thoroughly disgusted in Eurostars willingness not to help. Shame on all of you
Train #9937 coach #32 | The app wont let you rebook our train so we are stuck in Calais after 10 hours of nightmare travel. 0 communication from the company and wont offer any form of payment for accommodation we had to get. One of the most frustrating and disappointing companies I have ever booked with. Will not be using this terrible app or company again. | This app is really annoying. It doesn‚Äôt allow to select Paris as a departure city. Not in Search, nor shows in recent (although I have already made bookings previously) nor in popular, or alphabetical... 
The work around is to select Brussels, after select Paris as your destination and reverse the travel traject. 
Why is it not possible to make such a simple action as selecting whatever available city, possible?  Annoying! | I am locked out of my account when I tried to verify through my email and still not get in. I need to buy my tickets so this is a big let down | Just lost all my booking history on the app ‚Ä¶ This app is so bad !!! | When selecting departure time of your ticket it doesn‚Äôt tell you how early you need to arrive. Only after purchasing it says 90 minutes and so on. I‚Äôm a first time traveler on this train and I had no idea. And I cannot make it there before 90 minutes.. a warning before ticket purchase would have prompted me to book a later train. Please improve it | And terrible signage | Doesn‚Äôt let me book a trip at the original price I wanted due to ‚Äútechnical error, try again later‚Äù. I submit a complaint form online and never get a confirmation that it was created. Contact customer service and they say they can‚Äôt do anything despite me having a screenshot of the error. Fix your app and people wouldn‚Äôt be calling or complaining as much. Part 2: just tried booking another train ticket through the app, had a ticket in my cart and then the app glitched out and when I went to go purchase again the prince went up !! And it would give me an error to make the booking even when my details were right. HORRIBLE APP | Why not??!! | Email with tickets contains ticket number.
App requests booking reference!
Not user friendly not having info presented in
one place! | We are a family of 5 and our train from
Amsterdam to London was cancelled due to weather. We have been trying for several days to get assistance and request a refund. We had to rent a car and drive to Brussels to make our next destination a day late. The app itself is circular with information and no solutions or formal communication about how to reconcile this issue. Very frustrating! | Why? | Can‚Äôt access tickets thru app.  Can‚Äôt save tickets to Apple wallet. | The app just closes.. does nothing‚Ä¶ tried to delete it and re download.. still does not work .. 
was working fine until a day ago | See above | Eurostar is in the business of ripping off unsuspecting tourists. It‚Äôs a business designed to extort as much money from you as they can. You‚Äôre better off flying. There‚Äôs very little upside.  The food is disgusting and the servers seem hostile towards the passengers. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this SCAM organization. We didn‚Äôt not have a set cut-off time on our tickets, got to the station with 30+ minutes before the train was to depart‚Äîbut they said we‚Äôd only be allowed on the train if we paid them $750. So, if we paid more money, we hadn‚Äôt missed the train, but $300 tickets‚Äîand we ‚Äúmissed‚Äù the train?!?!? Airlines do not do this!! I still had to pay another $350 to leave 3 hours later. I‚Äôm disgusted with Eurostar and will NEVER consider booking anything with them again. | Couldn‚Äôt book travel initially.  Then can‚Äôt choose seats.  Not impressed. | Using same login has to enter booking code to synch. Should have been automatic. | is a dream take this for travel France-London | I made a mistake and bought 2 tickets for me and my wife, but both in my name. Our last name is the same. I need to change the first name on my wife‚Äôs ticket. I can not find how to correct the mistake. | Very difficult to navigate | I‚Äôve used this app for years without any problems. This morning, 13th Feb 2023, it updated itself, and now with the new version it is unusable: opens for a split second then crashes and quits. I‚Äôve restarted my phone, but still doesn‚Äôt work. | Kept changing Birthday. Ugg | Super easy to use!! | I used this app a lot when I was in Europe in 2022. It works very well and has a good UI. It‚Äôs also very handy when using multiple rail companies. Just a word of caution: Always check to see if you can book directly with the railway or other companies. For example, I travel in France a lot. If I use this app for my wife and I to take the train from London to Paris it‚Äôs $50 more than booking with the SNCF app (same day, time, seats, class, etc). Also, it‚Äôs non-refundable using this app. Just an FYI. | Purchasing tickets as an American who hasn‚Äôt been to Europe in many years. Very easy app to use | The website, app, and customer service is an embarrassment.  Our train was cancelled.  NOT at all easy to reschedule without losing more time off your trip and/or paying fees.  The US number is disconnected, and nobody ever responded to five emails sent six weeks ago.  The trip has come and gone without any acknowledgement of our issues.  Total disappointment! | My trip was cancelled- accepted the new itinerary with a pre selected seat availability- seating in a set of 4 is very uncomfortable - specially if you are tall- 
Food is 2 pieces of bread -butter - oj- yogurt-
If you take the early schedule know that most people are business people and they could be on a phone call and clicking on a key board the entire 3.5 hour trip- trip is advertised as 2.5 hour from London to Paris - we left at 8:00 and arrived in Paris at 11:30. | I must have tried to book my tickets 15 times with my US card, failure each time. I have had to borrow money from a friend‚Äôs card to pay for these stupid tickets. Simply terrible. And bad customer service too, slow to reply pond and useless when they do. | The best and fastest way to go Paris ! | We received great service in London and Paris well beyond everything we expected | While the app works great for bookings and selection of seats during  booking, if they change your seats because of an equipment change the app shows your original seat selection 

This was a problem because during check in at the station, the new receipt only printed on half the paper    This meant you couldn‚Äôt read the new car or seat number.  The station equipment issue isn‚Äôt a problem the app can fix but the app should have reflected the new car/seat assignments 
Had to track down a station attendant for assistance 

Fix this issue and 5 stars | I just traveled with my 6 year old to Rotterdam, although the train was late outbound it was still a smooth trip. The train team were really friendly and helpful changing our seats as my son gets travel sick going backwards.it‚Äôs such an east way to travel to so many destinations. Thanks Eurostar. | Not sure if this works as seee no text. Crazy bad site app. Worst in world.  Can‚Äôt reset password or register. Uselesss | Finding help on this app is a nightmare! I‚Äôm trying to cancel a trip I‚Äôve rolled forward already due to COVID travel restrictions that existed in France and I‚Äôm getting a message to contact my travel agent (I bought direct from Eurostar) and I can‚Äôt find a number to call for help! | The boy to answer questions on Eurostar webpage or app does not work, very frustrating.

Train travel and service are otherwise excellent, but good luck on getting answers to your questions. | I had changed my destination location and the agent from Eurostar stated they would email a voucher for this trip. They did not do this and I have tried emailing Eurostar multiple times and they never respond. They encourage you to do everything on the internet but their website does not make it possible. Very poor customer service. | Delays one way, more delays coming back and the app doesn‚Äôt keep up real time. Surely, ‚Äúincidents‚Äù on the track can be related in a more timely manner. Regardless, it seems the journeys‚Äô timing are increasingly unreliable. | App does not seem to work, the destinations don‚Äôt load on the bookings page | I tried to book online and I pressed the buy now button and nothing registered. I uploaded the app to my phone and the tickets came through to my email perfectly. I highly recommend the app. | Just tried to book tickets for my family. When entering dates of birth the app actually changes them. For example when I enter 22 into the ‚Äúday‚Äù field it changes it to 21 right after I go to another field.
Reading in the app reviews and on Google, maybe this is an issue with USA bookings. | Could not get the app to book my tickets | Email received shows the wrong travel dates, booking app shows correct dates.  Tried the chat feature on your app and the algorithm of it doesn‚Äôt help in these circumstances. | First, I‚Äôve traveled by train for work and pleasure and have had to use this app to book or manage my travel. Its constantly not working, freezing, payment page won‚Äôt load, several error messages, etc. this is not worth the struggle or hassle and will totally turn you off for trains | No way to reach customer service.! They canceled my train and I can‚Äôt rebook and get a refund! | Show the booking in some foreign language | The app does almost everything‚Ä¶ except let me login to my account. App quits back to the Home Screen. I‚Äôm sure they will fix it in the next update. Looking forward to my first trip next summer!

Login bug fixed! Changed to 5 stars. See. I knew they would fix it. | I wanted to pay homage to the hard working people of the Eurostar family and enjoy traveling at the same time.

My second search a few minutes later showed me prices had increased by $30. It would not show me the car I saved. | Momondo used to be really nice, but now they have opened to scammers like Ovago and Gurufare.

I have signaled it to them bot no reaction so far. | It doesn‚Äôt show only published fares directly from the airlines even if you select that option in the settings.  This app works on deception to the end user at all levels who do not understand how to legitimately book travel.  Avoid at all costs and book direct instead. | Best website/app to search for your flights | install this cheap free app now!!! literally it made traveling 100x easier!!! | Best deals of tickets | I have like this app for several years, ever since I heard about it, I‚Äôve been able to search numerous fly to numerous states in numerous countries, always leave me in the right direction | I absolutely love the Momondo app! It's a fantastic tool for organizing trips and finding cheap flights. The user-friendly interface makes it a breeze to search for and compare flight options. The app's ability to provide a wide range of flight choices, along with helpful filters, ensures that I always get the best deals. Plus, the price alert feature is a game-changer, helping me snag those unbeatable fares. Momondo has become my go-to travel companion, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone looking to plan their next adventure! | I love this app. It gives good results for every search I conduct. The fact that I can track flights makes this app even super. Will recommend it to all interested in traveling. | Ok ch·∫•t l∆∞·ª£ng | Algo bueno siempre tiene margen de mejora. | Very good | Perfect ü§© | Very good | Searching all those sites at once is really powerful and helpful! | This search engine has great options and comprehensive listing of fares and itineraries. Excellent filters too. Very good if you need to search for for mildly complicated transoceanic routes. | As someone who has been a pro at shopping best deals for flights for years, momondo is hands down the best app for the job. | With iPhone 13 app doesn‚Äôt work | I‚Äôve loved the speed and ease of this app, but recently realized I need to be more vigilant about where it is sending you for the deals. 

Searched for flights, and upon selecting one we liked, was redirected to a different site, ‚ÄúFlights Mojo.‚Äù If this happens to you, DO NOT purchase a flight from Flights Mojo, they are absolutely a scam company. After completing our reservation, we received an email that it was not complete until we called them. The number took us to a call center abroad where we are  informed that the flights we reserved are not available, and then the operator tried to extract more money for completely different flights through completely different cities. It was *extremely* difficult to leave the call with any assurances that we weren‚Äôt being charged, and we are still really worried about having given them credit card info. Other reviews of Flights Mojo online have nightmare stories about reservations cancelled and no refunds issued, demands for more and more fees as well as photos of identification and credit cards to be sent. Lots of people left high and dry when they try to use tickets. 
I have no idea if Momondo does any vetting for where it sends you with searches, but please be aware that in this instance they‚Äôre allowing a very sketchy company to solicit your financial information. | I have been looking at multiple airlines who fly to me requested destination and This app is only showing one option. Totally not correct | Tried to book flights three times and they changed the fees every time baiting me for more lonely- total SCAM | Unfortunately, momondo has no protection for its users from booking tickets with scam like travel agencies like edreams, etc. If this platform kept allowing these companies to lure customers into their scam like businesses operation, it‚Äôs basically a culprit. 

##For other users, please be careful for the third party booking websites momondo is directing you to, some may never refund your money even when promised. Read online for honest customer reviews before paying or book directly with the airline. | Really good in searching for cheap prices and it‚Äôs my go-to app for almost all my travel expenses | Wether it‚Äôs a room or a flight you‚Äôre looking for, I‚Äôve found, by far, the cheapest and yet high quality places and airlines through this app. | Excellent | I‚Äôve bought 2 plane tickets now using momondo and compared to the experience using other services e.g. KAYAK, momondo seems to have all the upsides and none of the downsides. The search API is responsive, searches don‚Äôt take terribly long (~1min), prices are legit and low, and the purchase pipeline is simple and streamlined. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the purple background lol. All this, for free, is indicative of serious focus on quality. Nice job on this app guys | This by far the best app to me and this is just my own opinion someone else might have a different opinion but to me I like the way it‚Äôs set up in terms of breaking down time schedules and prices when you looking for hotels or flights no matter your destination been using for yrs it works for me | The best I have been able to find. Better than kayak, Google flights or skiplagged | Love this app | This use to be a great app until they started to send me massive spam about tickets prices I've been searching for (without asking me). Also, I've started to receive spam from some airlines from which I've blocked tickets trough Momondo app and I think they sell our email address. I'm moving to another app. | Monjurul Islam | The app provides convenience to track flight prices but even after setting up the price alerts , it never notify me if the prices have increased or decreased. | Brings the best prices as always. You just have to be careful with the websites that you completeyour booking from. | I love using momondo to book my trips however I don‚Äôt appreciate multiple sites asking for my personal information like my passport number & Identification card info ; I have book with airlines and they never asked me for these personal information; now I‚Äôm thinking twice to use momondo to book any trip kiwi was one of the sites who asked for my info when I called them they said it‚Äôs the airline so I called the airline and they said that it‚Äôs not them it‚Äôs the site kiwi policy ‚Ä¶ thanks momondo | Listen!! I love to travel and this is my favorite app to check flight prices! Amass The cheapest and updated you on flights if goes lower | I‚Äôve been using momondo since 2016 that‚Äôs 5 year so ago and from the beginning I‚Äôve had a love affair with it. User friendly and updates keep getting better. And couple of years I told my brother about it as the only choice for flight or Internatinal flights etc. Yesterday I referred my cousin to it. And I referred many others to the best online flight and hotel search engine Momondo has been my travel companion. ‚ù§Ô∏è | I totally understand but this is so stupid for the application to delete all flights to Russia or from it!!!! | Very good Ap for a long time until now. I was Directed to purchase tickets at Fare Bubble and thought I booked a flight but it was a scam website. Had to cancel my credit card that I used.  This is unacceptable and disappointing that Momondo allows this type of partner on the Ap. Buyer beware. | I have been using the app for years and have booked all my vacation during that duration using this app! The prices are not too good to be true they are legit! | Just like the title i bought insurance the rental company did not recognize and i had to buy a completely different insurance. Don't get car insurance until you pick up the car. Otherwise momondo can be good at saving about ten$ per flight reservation. | This side is like the magic genie you wish you always had to tell you all the different flights and times and you can sort by anything and you do NOT NOT have to go through any shenanigans. It takes you directly to the airlines booking site. No shenanigans. | I bought tickets yesterday, I did the payment and received the confirmation from Oojo, today they called me and saying that I have to pay $1K more. No body is here to solve the problem. Just Scam | Very effective website to get some very good flights. Pay attention to the total time involved. | I‚Äôve been waiting for 2 weeks to get my eticket still haven‚Äôt got it have to go to Florida in a week they say they misspelled my name and you can hardly understand the operators there very dissatisfied and hoping I can get my tickets since I took off work | YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME, THANK YOU ! | I love this app but recently stopped using because when I try clicking on Anywhere it does not do anything. Usually it pre-populated the ‚Äúto‚Äù field but it‚Äôs not doing that. | I need contact info. No numbers for them or the third party agent. I need to change my flight and I‚Äôm within the 24 hours. The third party is Travelgenio and I am seeing they have one star on Yelp. Why would you use them momondo?  Horrible. | The website allowed ‚Äúfare bubble‚Äù to post flight search results. The company is an absolute scam. They don‚Äôt answer their phone, email is bounce back, and IM has nobody on the other end.

I didn‚Äôt see it but having a map incorporated into the app for the visual reference would be nice.  Thanks. | I created a stellar account years ago. Didn't use it much but I remember thinking it was cool. I came back to try after seeing an ad online that made it look different. But I can't login using my old login (fb) without it saying my email is already associated. I'm clicking login, not create account. 

So I guess it just isn't meant to be. Sad. I had high hopes. | Love sharing all my fav travel moments in one place. The new trips feature is cool for planning trips or sharing trip itineraries with friends. | Hello. There is a bug with the current (11.2.1) version of the Stellar app for iOS. The app provides an option to use a Twitter/X login to create an account.

If the user backs out (cancels out) of the Twitter authorization login, the user will is sent back to an unresponsive Stellar app. The app freezes until it is manually restarted or deleted and then re-downloaded. This is very odd, as I have never seem this happen with any other iOS app. Canceling out of the Twitter authorization prompt is usually the first thing I do. I have never seen an iOS freeze the way the Steller app does.

My Twitter account of @RandomiOSBugs tagged the @StellerStories account online. Please investigate this issue, thanks.

P.S. the Steller app‚Äôs Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions links are not working on the Twitter authorization page either. | I used to love this app, I still do ‚Ä¶.

Except for the inability to create stories, with more than one page.

The format was far better when first created .
It was much easier to use. 
Maybe it‚Äôs just me , but the changes make it harder to compose stories that allow for multiple pages as it used to.

Also . I was locked out of my original story page ,  for which support was never able to help , making it u organized and harder  
to create. | After falling out of love with so many social platforms, Steller give the experience feel without the pretentious vibes of some *cough* other platforms | This app was so easy to join and will definitely inspire you | Great for finding beautiful places to travel! | I'm
So disappointed that this app was so much better and easy to share to download plus easy to make stories before.  Now I'm confused again it's like the 3rd time changing your app. I can't share it on my social media etc. I'm very disappointed and sad about it. | Love the app. You see travelers‚Äô perspectives organized around locations that are hard to get elsewhere. Like the simple nav too! | One of the better apps for creatives, it incorporates text, photo & video to allow anyone with a creative eye to present their work and/or their life in the most beautiful way possible as ‚ÄúStories‚Äù or ‚ÄúMoments.‚Äù | I‚Äôve been on this app for many moons.  I‚Äôve seen all the changes.  Some I love, some irk me to no end!

The best thing about this app is that you can explore the world from your phone.  You can plan vacations, workaround and add to your bucket list without the hassle of talking to a travel agent or scrolling for hours on other social media networks.  

O probably should also mention that  it‚Äôs simple to use and easy to share content to other platforms.

Download it today! | So cool to see how this app has changed over the years. I remember this before search was even added. Keep up the great work :-) | I just started using the Stellar app this week and cannot put it down! I love adding stories and seeing the cool new places I want to visit. And soooo easy to use. I‚Äôve been looking for an authentic travel app and THIS.IS.IT! | I‚Äôve had major issues with this app from trying to create an account to trying to post my first post. It seems either something is wrong with their servers or with the app. The only way I have been able to get in was by using a VPN. Even then the functionality still isn‚Äôt there. Considering who built this app I find that very odd. | Screw the algorithms, ads, and noise of your other social apps. Steller is a simple and beautiful way to discover and create stories. Turn the camera roll on your phone into beautiful stories to share with families and friends. I use this for trip recaps, building my travel hit list, and discovering hidden gems and adventure ideas. I can‚Äôt recommend this app enough. It‚Äôs so fun and easy to use. | I love Steller for finding travel recommendations and keeping up with friends travels. The new feature, Moments, makes it even easier to share things on the go! Great way to connect with fellow creators üòç | This app was so great but I still can‚Äôt figure out why they had to make every page auto advancing. I‚Äôm having to pause every page and it makes the entire experience feel rushed. There are other apps for that. This should be for well told stories that deserve more than 2 seconds per page. | I started using Steller recently and I love it! It‚Äôs such a great way to share travel stories and it is also perfect for sourcing inspo and tips for upcoming trips. It works well, has all of the necessary features, and the user base is full of like minded individuals who love to travel, get outside, and explore. | Been on the App for les than thirty minutes and my mind is blown. Incredible content from real travelers. Bravo Steller. | I used to love this app when it launched but this has become hard to use and needlessly complicated to create. | App is wonderful but I really need to be able to turn the sound off. I have the sound turned off on my phone most of the time so I‚Äôm not disturbing anyone else nearby. But the music plays on every story with no way to turn it off. Have to turn the volume all the way down, then hope I remember to turn it back up later. Really a miss in an otherwise great app and platform. | I cant reset my password knowing my username. I haven't logged in for about a year and yet my account is viewable. 

None of possible emails (of 3) received any reset email. | This app is honestly amazing, all I want to figure out is how to move the frame around so the photo i want to post i can center the subject in the frame but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs coming. Love this app so far! | I have been searching for an app that I could switch to from IG, since IG has so many ads these days. Steller is stunning! It‚Äôs not as active as Instagram, but I love that there are no ads and I can choose who to follow without algorithm suggestions. | I love this app, but is there anyway to pay for the service so there will no longer be a watermark on the page if I repost to other social media accounts? It ruins the clean layout of the page, and that is why I use this app in the first place. | When I first stumbled on this app, I was a love! A beautiful story book play this year short simple stories through photos and an economy of words would be ideal for sharing. Unfortunately, it has a ludicrous Instacrap format to it that you cannot control the speed in which to consume it. If I wanted IG, I would‚Äôve just gone with the real thing, but since I am not 14, there‚Äôs no reason to go with it. Bring back the old storybook format! | I love Steller because I can tell stories and write through a social media app. I‚Äôve only done one post but I already love the app! So much fun, and very simple. It isn‚Äôt confusing at all. (That sounded sarcastic but it wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm serious) 100000% recommend. | I really wanted to use and love this app.... I created a story but was unable to upload it I reached out to stellar via Twitter. Someone reached out to me and tried to help but then dropped off the face of the earth it‚Äôs been over a month and I‚Äôve yet to hear from anyone. I‚Äôm close to deleting it at this point there‚Äôs just no point in having an app I can‚Äôt use. What‚Äôs worse your story doesn‚Äôt save on their sever so if I delete and reinstall the app I‚Äôll loose my story ..... so wish I could have enjoyed it but oh well it is what it is | This is all that you need. One app for all your Instagram stories need! | Para mi es la mejor aplicaci√≥n que he encontrado para escribir mis historias con fotograf√≠as. Las herramientas son f√°cil de utilizar y quedan muy bonitas una vez finalizado el trabajo. Saludos desde Costa Rica | Update: Since recent updates to app,
Some of the best previous features are gone. It is not as easy to format and select styles, captions, and even to import photos. 
A wonderful medium for sharing stories - art, photography, recipes - easy to use. Highly recommend for creatives and appreciation. | Love how Steller has some beautiful and simple templates to help share photos of my travels and add tips and notes about the destinations. The new map feature is helpful for finding unique spots to explore. I also love that the stories can be downloaded and shared easily to IG, making story creation useful for multiple platforms. | Minimalist visual storytelling. It's perfect, easy, and across multiple channels. Done. | I love this app... it‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs classy very easy to maneuver. We all have A story to tell. Make it Stellar. | I just started doing this and I just read a review and I feel like the person had some very good points; it would be great to do little family skits and save them together and eventually combine all these skits to become a movie night actual mo a movie type bigger one you can include‚Äù just to have them in one place and all of the projects saved. I love checking out the stye 
This is not an option yet.  I also would like to change the theme for new videos etc.  Nonetheless, I will be using this one specifically probably more than a few Thera I‚Äôm will to train myself to use. Thanks overall. Looking forward to many acquaintances I love and we support each other. If you would like to pitch in too, show posts to others and get help when stumped, it‚Äôs all good. You‚Äôll belong. Children are encouraged to have interest in family stories. Not like is new grannies, and considered more than me and my family adventures aka best comedy to pee your pants from low bladder function.  Overall:    Thanks for all this! My new scrapbook project/ video family scrapbooking new is waiting to start. Too happy to form memories in an updated. | User experience is great with this app. Everything is where I expect I'm going to find it when navigating through it. I find that really important because apps that are easy to use keep me coming back. I'm really loving it! | It‚Äôs pretty cool! Lol helped me step my story and post game up a bit lol | Title ^

Otherwise great app, simple and not bloated. Minimalistic yet functional.
Love it. | One app I‚Äôve kept around on my iPhone but the iPad version is less than desired! Like half the apps available it does this weird non-full screen thing that has a black border that takes up 1‚Äù of of the screen on both sides! Until that‚Äôs fixed I‚Äôm iPhone only :( | Nice clean design layouts, and it‚Äôs perfect for me to get my artwork out there! Easy user interface. | This app is simple and straight to the point more articles should be like this versus beating around the bush | I‚Äôd been working on a post for stellar for quite some time, putting in hours of effort. 
Months later I went back to add other thoughts and pictures to this draft and it‚Äôs gone... 

I‚Äôm sooo upset. So much work done that I will never get back. 

Hoping Stellar will reach out with a solution. Hopefully they can recover it. | Love this app so much!!! | I can see how this could be a great way to share photos in a story format. I might be overlooking it but I feel there needs to be an option to change the background color. Not just by purchasing blush, but custom color, or even a photo from album. Also I think the option to rearrange the photo spots to where I want would be fantastic. Other than that simple to use and nice designs. | Just downloaded and it‚Äôs great so far | I hate this app. Bought several fonts and now they‚Äôre all gone. And it doesn‚Äôt do a square format for Instagram. Also, the choices in the purchased fonts are really lame. Meh!!!! | Occasionally I wish I could better place my picture in the frame, though.

It says it is processing a payment, only to get to the very last step and say that something went wrong and you need to try again. You are constantly caught in an endless loop of app malfunction. I‚Äôve wasted HOURS trying to book various tickets after hours, and the automated phone system is no better!! | This app periodically will show a certain ticket price when you go to book trains, but then will not allow you to check out at that listed price, it will tell you your ticket is no longer available. When you go back to book the ticket for the same time slot, you will find that your ticket price has risen ~$20. Pretty scummy app design / horrible user experience. | The app is just okay for finding trains but it won‚Äôt let me buy a ticket. This has happened twice now, where I go through all the steps and check all the boxes and the ‚Äòpurchase‚Äô button turns green. I press it and wait and try again and  ‚Ä¶. nothing happens. Have removed app and reinstalled. Same problem and so I have to use my computer and a browser. Like I said, my last 2 train trips and the app won‚Äôt work to buy tickets. I‚Äôve got an iPhone 14 and the latest everything. | I can't find anywhere in app to sign up for trip alerts.  Like the 3 hr delay today!   App says delayed. Nothing more. I received no notifications.  And app still shows original time for departure.
If someone sitting with me didn't tell me corrent updates I wouldn't even know. | Amtrak is my favorite mode of transportation | Can‚Äôt find my round trip tomorrow on this app and there appears no way to add it. | This message pops up every time o try to use the app. Pretty annoying. | Need to have text ability for ticket restorations.  This would be in addition to e-mail. | App keeps crashing. Had to go to website and use instead of app. | Amtrak always seems to have some sort of issue when it comes to payment. It has failed to process my cards time and time again. I‚Äôve called my bank to make sure it‚Äôs not an issue with my account, but it‚Äôs never a problem with the bank. Because of this glitch, I‚Äôve lost good seats multiple times. | Only lets you pay for a ticket with 1 payment method. So if you have a $100 visa card and want to pay for the rest of the ticket with a separate credit card you cant do it. | Why doesnt your site allow me to log out? I go to my account page but it refuses to go down to Log out | The profile tab on my iPhone is laid out such that the logout button is off the screen. There is no way to logout! I have to kill the app. Sheesh! | We just got off the California Zephyr in Chicago from Emeryville. I want to acknowledge an excellent car attendant, Rashid. 

Rashid, our genuinely nice Amtrak car attendant keeps everything clean and orderly in the car and prepares our beds after dinner for the night‚Äôs sleep. When you come back from breakfast, your rooms, your beds are made and everything is in order. He even makes a huge pot of coffee every morning! The best!! | Do not be fooled. The Phone app does not allow you to purchase tickets using your points. Repeat: the Phone app does not allow you to purchase tickets using your Amtrak points. They lied.

I wanted to purchase tickets to visit a dying friend up in New York City and use my points, there is no option using the phone app to use points. Amtrak is a liar and my 52,000 points are not available to be used using the Phone app at all. I will never use Amtrak for anything ever again. | Doesn‚Äôt make it easy to print a ticket. Had to turn receipt in. For work and could print it from app. | I can‚Äôt even seem to find a station that hosts even a slight default to be near where I‚Äôm trying to go but everywhere it says there isn‚Äôt any scheduled trip between those stations but then doesn‚Äôt tell you which ones can! And how close and far. Ridiculous | I used the app to modify my trip.  I selected the train, paid using Apple Pay, received the payment confirmation and then received an error message on the map that the transaction couldn‚Äôt be processed and to call customer service.  At the same time, my colleague made the same trip/train change with no issue. Less than five minutes later, I opened the app and made the same change but the price was $50 higher than the first attempt that was cancelled. | Love planning travel trips with you. | WAY too many emails!!!! | Worst possible transportation out there. Why is there no option for ZERO stars. (Long story short, I showed up early and somehow they left me behind while managing to put the fault all on me)!!!
First off, Amtrak is Never on time so if you don‚Äôt live a block away from the station it‚Äôs such an inconvenience. With my experience, in my opinion their main motive is transferring goods they have, therefore their care for the people who decide to use their transportation is absolutely terrible, (IN MY EXPERIENCE). Not only have I been miss treated on every occasion of riding Amtrak, I also pay an outrageous amount for a ticket, (mind you, us people are basically bonus pay since they drive the route anyways). With that being said, March 17th 2024 I had a friend with a train ticket which stated the train was suppose to arrive at 2 a.m. We woke up around midnight (I live an hr from the train station!). We checked the website when we woke up and found out the train had been delayed and was now expected to arrive around 5:30 a.m. We take a cat nap and wake up to check the time, now the estimated time was around 8 am. We now stay awake so we can keep an eye on the map and location of the train. Arrival time constantly changes, they constant break down or wait for another trade that had broke down. Finally, the train gets close enough we can trust the estimated time arrival. We leave with plenty of time, and arrive more than 30 minutes before the train. The train was arriving and before it stopped my friend got out of my car and got in the back seat to grab his belonging. The train stops as he grabs his last bad (we are about 60 ft from boarding location) the lady at the sandpoint train station who I believe stated to be the janitor, had yelled from less than 60 ft away ‚Äúhurry hurry the train is leaving!!‚Äù. Me completely dumbfounded that they hadn‚Äôt even came to a complete stop yet before saying they were leaving, told my friend to hurry up and get over there so he started to run. He was halfway (30 ft approximately still running) when I notice the train start to move, sure enough they continued moving leaving my friend behind (who mind you, had over payed for the ticket in the first place!!). I know the train is terrible, so I already have low expectations. This though, has pushed me to the point of leaving this review. I called to request reimbursement of the first ticket as well as a free new ticket for the next available train and yes got a new ticket scheduled for the next day, which was ‚Äúfree‚Äù from Amtrak. In my opinion that is not a free ticket, therefore I‚Äôm not (nor is my friend, who should be) is truly compensated for THEIR mistake. I understand mistakes happen, but this was no mistake and with less than 20 more seconds everything would have been fine and I would not have to drive 2 hrs round trip to bring him to the station for the second time. I will admit, he was not standing on the boarding platform, Just 60 or so ft away waiting in my car. If I must restate, the train DID NOT stop for more than 30 seconds and started to leave as my friend was walking up to the train. This is a long review so I don‚Äôt expect anyone to get this far but if you have I highly advice preparing for the most horrific public transportation experience, better yet figure out different transportation! My hopes is to spread awareness so they loose business and have no option but to treat the people better to maintain customers. | I recently downloaded the rewards app. It is simple enough to purchase tickets, however I have been purchasing Amtrak trips online the last three years for my daughter who is a student and always sent the trip details to both of our emails. 
The app does not give me the option to send the trip info to 2 emails. Since I am paying and she is traveling, it seems reasonable we would both need the details conveniently send to both cell phones/emails | Every city I put in come up no available train! No way to get from NY city to Portland Oregon by train? Gives no suggestions; nothing! I remember taking the train from NC to Seattle WA and enjoying it so thought I would take the train from PA to Portland Oregon but not possible according to the app. It will be just as nice of a drive. | I installed this app on my iOS17.4 about 1.5 hours ago. Every time I continue to the payment page, ‚Äúlogin expired‚Äù and I have to login again. Not only do I have to see that message every time (five times already) but I have to select OK three times to get out of the message! I‚Äôm not sure how confident I should be to board this train for a random or spontaneous tripü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | doesn‚Äôt work | The system will not allow me to log  on keeps asking me to change my password and when I change it, it does not accept it. I am frustrated cause I‚Äôm trying to prepare a trip. | We‚Äôre on the eastbound Zephyr right now, trying to see if we‚Äôll get to Chicago in time to get to O‚ÄôHare in time to catch a flight. The app is either lying to us or has no clue. It says that the train left Emeryville at 7:47 two days ago. It really left after noon! FWIW, we did get good info yesterday. Today, fantasy. We‚Äôre using railrat today. | The title says it all!! Easy to use and accepts Apple Pay. Didn‚Äôt have to create a login to get a ticket. Amazing experience, thank you | The Amtrak app pauses my audio every single time I open the app. It‚Äôs not an audio app‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no reason for this to happen. It‚Äôs a broken experience. | 1. After logging into the app (or website), I should be able to access my reservations without having to know the reservation #. That‚Äôs the point of logging in! So the user can find their reservation number and details. 

2. It‚Äôs not possible to print an eTicket from the app or website. Even Customer Service could not email an updated eTicket to me after they changed one segment of my trip. They said I‚Äôd have to ‚Äúask at the station.‚Äù (With fingers crossed, I guess!)

3. On the app, ticket information doesn‚Äôt show Arrival Dates ‚Äî just the time. 
Example: I‚Äôm traveling from Chicago to LA, and it shows ‚ÄúApril 9 Departure 2:50p‚Äù ‚ÄúArrival 8:00a.‚Äù 
When? The next day? Two or three days? How helpful is that? 

It would also be nice to be able to see the break down of stops on the way.

The main page of the app is cluttered with marketing stuff about ‚ÄúPutting Customers First,‚Äù which is exactly what the app does not do. If a customer has reached the point in Amtrak‚Äôs marketing ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù that they are using the app, it means they have or want to book travel and need to use the app to access their eticket and trip details‚Äî like which day they might be arriving at their destination. | I value the app in itself. I take advantage of tracking trains, and it seems to be accurate. However, the biggest issue is that I am not able to purchase tickets more than a few days in advance in the app. I went to the web browser to see if I could purchase tickets for a couple weeks in advance and it worked! So, developers, please fix this bug in the app! | Can‚Äôt find my trio | Just booked a trip thru the app.  Went back to retrieve info.  No upcoming trip.  I need the reservation number to locate‚Ä¶
Which I assumed would be in my upcoming trips.  App is not worth the time of creating an account | I usually have a good experience on Amtrak‚Ä¶ today was an exception. I have crutches and a boot. Didn‚Äôt ask specifically for disability seats and was given an assigned seat‚Ä¶ I asked the attendant if this was aisle or window. She barked Idk‚Ä¶ were full. Not true because coming from Philly to Wilson the disability seats were available just as on this return trip. She had to help with bags and didn‚Äôt seem to happy. I know the job is tough sometimes dealing with the public but a little courtesy and compassion goes a long way‚Ä¶during the trip I could have been more comfortable but wasn‚Äôt given that chance. I could have asked for better accommodation but decided I could make it. Thankfully, my seat-mate got off a few stops later and I was able to get the entire seat to elevate my foot. 
Sadly, she later got into a confrontational situation with another passenger whom needed to use the restroom during a layover. You don‚Äôt have to be nasty to inform customers if a service is not available. 
Hope the next experience will be better. 
Signed, Limpy Traveler | The app won‚Äôt let me purchase a train ticket. Fix it please | Worst app I‚Äôve ever used.  Tried multiple devices and website. Had to call an agent to buy a ticket.

However, the UX of the app is pretty terrible in my opinion. The search feature is inconvenient as you must select dates, # of guests, etc. What if I just want to see what my options are quickly? I shouldn‚Äôt have to fill out all of my trip details to see what hostels exist in a given location. Selecting dates and guest should be an option after you search a city. The wishlist feature is also not as helpful as it could be. I can‚Äôt figure out how to remove anything from a wishlist, and you can‚Äôt book directly from the wishlist- you have to find the hostel again through the annoying search. Not helpful. You also can‚Äôt edit a booking, only cancel and re-book (and they hold your deposit as long as they want to üòí) I think this app could be great with some improvements, but for now I only use it to find hostels and I book directly on their site. | Hostelworld has great options, and information.
It‚Äôs a pleasure to use this site.
Sincerely | Great app for finding hostels. Maybe a few updates to consider in the near future, when I done writing my review there‚Äôs no button to submit only to X out and deletes the review I was writing. The option to search and filter the reviews by multiple layers for example, female, age group 25-30, December 2023. | Great prices! | A friend referred me to this app as he had used it in his travels. I too highly recommend this app. I have had an overall wonderful experience with the app. Not only was I able to find hostels in *most* all the areas I wanted, I was also able to find things to do in the surrounding areas, at great prices might I add too. The only downside to the app on my end is I keep running into latency issues and app crashes. I have tried restarting the app and changing VPN settings and even turning my VPN off, ensuring the app is up to date, etc etc. the app still tends to lag a bit at random when my connect is fine otherwise on every other app in my phone. Then every now and then the app will crash. I still highly recommend this app, however, looking forward to figuring out this latency and crashing issue at some point. | Absolutely nuts trying to get any help with their product. I only use as a last resort. For the love of god, do not change your email address with them. They make it so hard. | Es un buen aplicativo seguro confiable que te brinda muchas opciones. | Nonstop popup notifications from chat rooms inside the app! | If a very poorly rated hostel gets a single 10 star review in a 6month period than that hostel will show up as 10 stars. You need to be very aware of what you are booking and read the reviews because it could appear as a 10 star hostel when in actuality they are as low as a 5 or 6 star (these are always dirty and disgusting even though hostelworld describes a hostel with a ‚Äúfailing‚Äù rating as ‚Äúgood‚Äù). So this makes the booking process more complicated instead of easier and puts you at great risk | I‚Äôve been with HW since its early days and have always supported the ease of booking through them. Lately their customer service seems to be going downhill and their turning into a megacorp. It is sad to see but seems true after my recent interactions with them. They make it more difficult to contact them and try to give you boilerplate responses‚Ä¶ book directly with properties when you can. | I have been trying to get a hold of hostel world staff about a reservation. There‚Äôs no number to call and they are quick to end the conversation over email. I will not be booking with this app again, I will be booking directly with the hostel. I am outraged with how poorly the communication works through this app. | I haven‚Äôt stayed yet | Makes life easier, more efficient and trusted for hostels.. the best | Started a dispute for a $400 charge to my account, they literally left me hanging with my request, and the hostel didnt even bother to reach out | I tried to change the dates of my trip (reduce the days) and hostelworld does not give me the option to change the dates, only cancel outright. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm about to be out hundreds of dollars.. | A website pops up after pressing the login button and there‚Äôs nowhere to put your username and password. Really embarassing | Easy to book great hostels. | So far easy to use and well organized | The cellular app doesn‚Äôt let me select Lets Go after I add how many guests | Don‚Äôt bother - booked wrong room and denied it even tho the room they said I booked had a different price and didn‚Äôt agree with what hostel said I booked. Also found same room for less with flexible terms and breakfast for less on booking They literally don‚Äôt care | Great app! Works all over the place! | Very user friendly and very descriptive. Reviews are key and even has a chat for travelers. | Cheap prices but they do not care about their customers! If you get unlucky and something happens, don‚Äôt count on them, even if you‚Äôre a loyal customer. Twice they let me down. The first: a hostel asked me to email them my card info before arrival despite making a deposit through Hostelworld. I‚Äôve stayed at dozens of hostels and was never asked for my card info prior to arrival. It seemed suspicious, so I asked them to have HostelWorld notify me directly if an action is needed. Instead, they canceled my reservation a few days before I arrived and HostelWorld wouldn‚Äôt refund my deposit. I had to book another place for 2x the price due to short notice. Second: Myself and two others were robbed within 1 week in the same hostel. I was robbed twice. The reception could have been more helpful by looking at hallway footage but said it would take too long! I left a factual & honest review for the hostel, warning others of the theft in respectful language, and HostelWorld deleted my review. | Hostel Makes a small globe comfortable and affordable. What more could one ask for? Happy New Year! | When I try to login via the app it redirects me to page to download app‚Ä¶then nothing happens | My reservations on Hostelworld app don‚Äôt show up later on the app.
I do receive an email from H confirming the reservation and another email from the hostel confirming the reservation. | I‚Äôve had the time of my life every time I‚Äôve traveled to Europe and Israel thanks to the easy and clean way to find accommodations! Thank again for all the help! | Every time I open the app it opens the browser and redirects me to the App Store. It‚Äôs annoying. | I have used this app in the early days and I still found it easy to use it‚Äôs platform! Over the years it has helped me so much to meet new people and see what‚Äôs around the area. Super helpful for solo Travelers and group travelers. A good heads up is that when you book anything here, it‚Äôs only reserving the space note that you will have to pay the rest when you check in. | why is the chat feature not working? nothing is loading | I keep getting redirected to redownload the app on the sign up page and when i click the link to ‚Äúopen app‚Äù it takes me to the app store. when i click the ‚Äúopen‚Äù option in the app store it takes me back to the same to options to ‚Äúdownload app from app store‚Äù or ‚Äúopen app‚Äù. it‚Äôs very frustrating since i‚Äôm trying to book something soon. | Great except for the utter lack of customer support these days. They seem to have axed the entire department and rely almost solely on automated emails pre-written responses in their help section. Good luck if you have any real issues. Booking 3rd party means any and all issues have to go through their customer support rather than the hostel‚Äôs. So youre boned if you need help | Pois eles indicam gosteis p√©ssimos na foto √© uma coisa mas a realidade outra | Thank you so much for making it easy to find last minute accommodation | Unfair booking policy‚Äôs with a hard to navigate app. Basically selected the correct dates however the app for some reason booked for the wrong month. Canceled minutes later however the fee was non refundable. I would recommend using hostel world to look at hostel reviews then googling the hostel and booking directly to save on the fee that Hostelworld charges. | Having the worst time of my life getting ahold of customer service to cancel my reservation and it won‚Äôt pop up in the app‚Ä¶ sooo??? | If in Denver, do it! Comfy beds, great staff, super clean and everything you need | The app is very slow and glitchy. Other than that the app is great | I have never been let down/disappointed by Hostelworld. From Israel to Thailand to Rome, I‚Äôve had consistently good experiences booking with ease through Hostelworld. Other travelers leave useful reviews and pictures are consistent with the actual hostels. I highly recommend this app, even for people who usually stay in hotels as sometimes private rooms in hostels are just as nice! | Why? | Won‚Äôt let me sign in, any attempt to create an account is not working either. | ‰∏≠‰ªãÂÖ¨Âè∏Ôºå‰∏çËÉΩÂèñÊ∂à‰∏çËÉΩÊîπÈ¢ÑÂÆö„ÄÇÁúüÁâõ | I have been using this for years but my last reservation was unpleasant. Both the hostel (Podshare Los Angeles) and the booking details in the Hostelworld app stated that CHARGES DUE UPON ARRIVAL (except for the Hostelworld fee which is billed as a deposit up front in order to secure reservation). I was charged in full by the hostel the same day. I have screenshots. Hostelworld customer service was useless and so was Podshare. | Ive tried logging in a million times, this app is a nightmare!!! It just keeps taking me back to the app store to download the app which i was already on in the first place!!!!!!!!!!! I even updated my phone thinking that could be the problem but no this app is just ridiculous | The app is extremely slow and buggy. It takes a few seconds to load anything in the app which can be extremely annoying when just checking things quickly. Lots of performance issues. When you open up a page of who is staying at your hostel, it must try and load every single person in the list at once rather than lazy loading. So, when I try to view a list of the 80 people staying at my hostel, the app freezes for a good 30 seconds before even showing the list. The messaging functionality is also extremely buggy and every chat is filled with ‚ÄúIs anyone else solo traveling?‚Äù, followed by a message like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to send that‚Äù because everyone accidentally hits the quick chat things. | Messaging functionality is extremely buggy. Jittery scrolling, slow loading of messages. It‚Äôs almost unusable. Otherwise a great app | Wish I could use the app but it won‚Äôt allow me to sign in, even after deleting and reinstalling. I contacted customer service but they said they don‚Äôt know what the problem is. | I‚Äôm new to international travel, and to hostels as well. This app takes the hassle out of finding a suitable place to stay, regardless of what you‚Äôre looking for. Hostelworld‚Äôs straightforward user interface and built-in social network make it fun to use as well. I can easily connect with other travelers with similar interests wherever I go. This app willinstantly add value to your travel experience! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | Best value | This is a great resource to start off your search for hostels in wherever part of the world you‚Äôll be traveling in. But after that, just book at the actual hostel‚Äôs website. It‚Äôs a few more clicks (and i believe the shrugging you might have) but you‚Äôll save yourself a few bucks.

We made the booking in early February and it was an instant confirmation booking. 42 days later the host cancels on us, claiming that they had another reservation. I went back to VRBO, and the property is listed for rent on the same date for $100 more. I talked to Vrbo multiple times, and they confirm that this is a bad practice but would do nothing to get the host to honor the original reservation. Instead, they‚Äôre trying to get me to book another property. I went back to booking reputable hotels. So long cheaters! | Required $59 insurance against property damage or refundable (at owners discretion) $1500 fee against damage, for four senior citizens staying for one night is uncalled for. | Easy to use and find great properties where we need them. | This condo is beautiful!!! Very clean with all new modern amenities. The living room looks right out onto the Banana River. There are docks  with the use of kayaks. It  is in a lovely quiet neighborhood. A short walk to the Coco Beach golf course and aquatic club. The Aquatic club has a beautiful 50 meter swimming pool, for us lap swimmers a real gem. We walked downtown in the evening to the restaurants. The public beach park is a short drive from the house with plenty of parking. We really enjoyed staying here and hope to return! | Received request for lengthy stay. Preapproved the request. Potential guest messages requesting direct contact to their email and phone number and that I accept payment in form of a mailed check. I declined this arrangement he suggested and contacted VRBO. Phone tech reported there was no way to know if the account was a real person or fraudulent. Reported had no way to contact account owner. Reported had no way to transfer my call to someone else that could accomplish those things. Clearly VRBO does not take fraudulent accounts seriously, which means they don‚Äôt take VRBO property owners protection against fraud seriously. 
This in addition to the fact that you charge higher fees than your competitor who DOES vet potential guests - I‚Äôm not sure that this is an app we will continue to utilize in the future. Disappointed is an understatement. | My biggest problem | This resort needs major updates!    Hot tub was broken the past 3 days.  Pools were cold and in need of refinishing.   Only 1 bartender at pool bar.   2 of the 4 elevators were broken.   People were stuck in it for 1/2 hour.  Front desk people were rude, especially Kyhon Flynt.   They let the teenagers run the place and when we complained he didn‚Äôt care.  He needs to be fired!  Old dirty carpet in hallway.   Our room was filthy, the balcony hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in years.   The balcony chairs were old and rusty.   The dining room chairs were falling apart.  The chair cushions and living room furniture was wore out and filthy.  The kitchen had an orange countertop from the 70‚Äôs.  The tub faucet was broken.   The water pressure was very poor.   The pots and pans were mis matched and handles falling off.  Very disappointing experience!   We won‚Äôt be back! | We had a wonderful stay at Cindie‚Äôs condo. Everything needed was there, and we relaxed on the deck and enjoyed the views and beaches. Wrapped up each day looking at the stars. | This was an amazing place to stay! | I am only wanting one email for my account and a password that is strong with a code check . Please every time. Thank You üòä | Spent a week in this condo.  Nicely appointed.  Brought too many clothes!  Owners care that you enjoy your time there! | The home was beautiful and clean. It was wonderful to be so close to the ocean‚Äîto wake up and go to sleep to the sound of ocean waves!  You may even see dolphins passing by. | We‚Äôve book and signed up using this site for the first time and overall site experience is poor at best. Can‚Äôt find our stay even after contacting support. I would not recommend this site nor do we plan to use in the future. | Many families visiting Puerto Rico stay in San Juan. Staying in this very clean home in Rio Grande we felt very safe. I cannot put in words how safe and relaxed we felt in this house.  Do not be afraid to venture out away from the hotels. Food trucks nearby with great food. Affordable prices for food and large enough portions to share.  People are super friendly. Host for house are the sweetest couple and really care about your comfort and enjoyment of Puerto Rico. They were always timely to respond to questions and help with any needed support. This home is a great location too many areas you will want to visit. It is close to National Forest, Family Adventure Park, beaches, and Old San Juan. Walmart and pharmacies close by too. I plan to visit Puerto Rico again and this would be a house I would stay in again. | This is a great place - if you are staying longer than a day or two you will need to get all the basics. | The unit was fine, cute and good location on the beach.  But the neighbors were smoking marijuana and we could not step foot onto the balcony because it smelled so bad. | The app constantly froze. 
Can‚Äôt do anything with it. | It‚Äôs a great location with oceanfront views of the beach and great views of the resort. Would definitely use the unit again. | I booked a hotel in Costa Rica for my honeymoon and got the hotel canceled by the owner after payment I contacted customer support and after three hours of being on the line still the issue is not resolved. They are trying to put me in one star and a half and two star hostel,because there are no more hotels in the area. I already booked activities that last me the whole day and they booked me one night and told me to figure out the second night and I will have to switch off hotels that doesn‚Äôt work as the time of the switch I will be on an activity. This has been the worst experience I‚Äôve ever ever had currently I‚Äôm still working on the case. My honeymoon is tomorrow and nothing is resolved. I tried to keep getting escalated, but the call centers are on the other side of the world. They say their escalations department are not in yet. | Location is fantastic and the space is clean and well kept.  The management was easy to deal with and we had no issues.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for location/hot tub and comfort! | I love VRBO. I‚Äôve had several successful bookings. However, the app has changed for the worse over the years. It is slow and cumbersome now. Open the app‚Ä¶slow. Login‚Ä¶slow. Multi factor authentication‚Ä¶slow. Property search‚Ä¶slow. Frustrating experience. The extra ‚ÄúOne Key‚Äù (Expedia and Hotels alliance) screens seem to exacerbate the suffering performance of the application. | I rented a home for a week in Mexico Beach Florida for 4/2025
The host cancelled it on me because they use the home that week but now I‚Äôm having a very hard time to get the insurance money back that I paid.
Check before you get caught up in this mess!!
Unhappy traveler | Easy to book with confidence | Great house, very clean. Only concern was with the warning about getting charged if we got makeup on towels wash clothes or linens, only then to see makeup stains on linens when we arrived( they had been washed). I wasn‚Äôt charged but I worried one of us would get makeup on a a wash cloth which seems like the purpose of a wash cloth. Other than this, all was great! | Loved the house. It was just like being at home. Well stocked with things you usually don‚Äôt find at a rental.  Easy check in and out. Easy keyless entry. The only suggestion we would make is the mattress in the bedroom on the main floor has seen it‚Äôs better days and lighting in this room was poor. The sofas were comfortable and plenty of towels and extras. Thanks for a wonderful stay and Thank you Maine for giving us one last big snow storm. | We loved the location as it was away from the touristy places and we had a car to take us wherever we wanted for the day.  We could go right outside our patio and snorkel and then hit up the local grocery store or restaurants like Calypso or Kaibo (Tuesday nights are great).  Barefoot beach was our favorite isolated and the most amazing coral. The place was clean, convenient and had everything we needed to feel at home for 5 days. | I cannot say enough good things about this VRBO.  First, the location is perfect.  We could walk everywhere.  We were four couples, old friends, so the four king bedrooms each with a bath were perfect.  We did not use the twin bed room, but it would be great for kids or singles in the same room.

Some of us have knee troubles, so the elevator was so appreciated, as well as the four designated parking spaces!

The living space was large and beautiful and clean. Though we had trouble with the TV, Gina was quick to respond and it was fixed quickly.  The kitchen was well equipped and spacious.  Best of all was the rooftop terrace.  We spent a lot of time up there, talking and enjoying cocktails with a view.

This was a pricey choice, but worth every penny.

Thank you Gina for a great stay in beautiful Savannah! | I literally canceled my reservation 10 minutes after I booked and a week later still have not received my refund! | Our trip here for Spring Break was perfect.  We actually asked to rent the house one extra day.  Luckily for us nobody else was booked to stay the next day at our house!
The lake was mostly frozen, so there was nothing to do on the lake but look out and be mesmerized.  The house was very accommodating besides needing more towels.  This house is very dated, but does not affect your stay.  Mostly on outside back wall!
Other then that it is a beautiful little set up and we plan on coming back during summer next time to see it in a different way. | You cannot search by property number. Not user friendly. Only a basic search by city and travel dates. | This is a review for their 3rd party travel protection. Poor communication, unclear verbiage. Literally never purchase it. I‚Äôm out my entire Vrbo after needing to cancel for reason out of my control. And after purchasing travel insurance. So I‚Äôm out  cost of my Vrbo as well as the additional cost of the travel insurance. | Intuitive and easy to navigate | San Miguel is one of the most beautiful, peaceful, tranquil places I have ever experienced!  The space is incredible!  The views are spectacular!  The owner is fabulous!  We had everything we needed, and, if not, Marci was very quick to fix that!  The place feels like you are on an island far away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the world, but, if you need something, it is not far to go to get it!  Highly recommend!!! | It has gotten better though, amazingly it‚Äôs still this bad. | I have only used the other vacation app, but enjoyed using VRBO. I will use it again!

The fees seemed a little higher, although it may be because of the location | The 4br condo was excellent. Pretty new and very clean. Location was slightly remote, but a golf cart rental got us around town and was a lot of fun!  Only negative with the condo was two small items. Ice machine in frig did not work and oddly they had no bowls in the kitchen. Neither a bid deal. 

Nice bay view from the balcony and the pool area was really nice. 

Highly recommend Kim‚Äôs Kuban as a local breakfast sandwich spot. Really good and fairly close by. | We stayed a property in Sugar Mountain,NC beds were all super dirty no one would come out and reclean or call us back. Was told we would be refunded part of the money and that never happened. | I get many email notifications but they direct you to the APP. From there it is difficult to navigate. | Don‚Äôt use Vrbo because they do not sync their calendars up with other travel apps, causing double bookings, and then having your reservation canceled four hours before your arrival | Condo has everything I Needed for a comfortable Stay!! | Can‚Äôt get help for days!!! Airbnb is where I will go back to | Great time by all.  Great views. | Very clean and enough room for the whole family.  We had a great stay!! | Stop, please!!! | I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with this app suddenly. I‚Äôve never had issues before and now it keeps freezing and refreshing and doesn‚Äôt show results of searches. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling/reinstalling and done several hard refreshes on my apple phone. None of this has helped. | Nine old neighbors/friends met in hopes of finding joy, peace and happiness. Mission accomplished. Paradise on the Strand was exactly what we hoped for. It had cozy king sized beds, private bathrooms for each couple, quality linens, thoughtfully supplied in baths, kitchen and games, and a view that cannot be beat. We had so many wonderful moments on the upper and lower decks, around the ample dining table and cooking together in the great kitchen. We enjoyed the sound of the tides coming in and out, watching surfers grab a ride, and taking walks along the Strand to the end of the pier, restaurants and shops. In short, we had an amazing time. 

Monique was wonderful to work with and was quick to reply to our needs. This house - Paradise on the Strand - could not have been better named. | Can‚Äôt log in due to onekey ad! | The house was clean, spacious, and had everything we needed. Close to town and Ski Cooper. Games and Roku TV for everyone. Plus a bit of space to spread out. Backyard would have fun if the weather was warmer!  Would recommend to families!  Had a great time!  Thanks! | The owners Kim And Ian greeted me hello at day one‚Ä¶nearly 3 months ago, after traveling  from the USA just after Christmas in 2023 - with an intent of re- grounding myself, having spent decades in the corporate world on a global stage and raising two amazing adult daughters.

From the moment I walked into the cottage I knew I was at home - in part, because Kim and Ian made me feel immediately at home. They asked what I was needing in life at the moment and molded their approach to me accordingly. 

They are enormously graceful hosts, who know the balance of leaving people to do their thing, and are yet seamlessly always there if they‚Äôre needed. They are what I call, amazing hosts‚Ä¶Never intrusive but always available. 

They have made me feel like I was the most important person in the world‚Ä¶. although reading the guestbook on the cottage further led me to believe they collectively have an enormous capacity to do this for many. They are that good.

Does not appear to be Apple phone compatible | I find it difficult to use! | This was acceptable at $30/mth for access to 3 different apps, but when you only camp 6 times a year for it to double its cost for the same functionality, then tier off the value of the app with functions that brought you to the app in the first place is just price gouging. | This is a really good app. Definitely recommend it. Mostly an easy way to put a trip together, plan stops, construct a map. I would give it 5 stars except for a few very frustrating things that drag this app down. And could easily be fixed. I do understand that maybe it‚Äôs user error, but ‚Ä¶ When you are on a trip, you open the trip and it goes to your current location in Map View. However, when you open the List View for that trip, why doesn‚Äôt it go to your current location instead of starting from day one and you have to scroll all the way down until you find what you‚Äôre looking for. The way dates are managed is a complete nightmare. Changing the dates of an entire trip is such a hassle. And you cannot plan a trip without dates as once you add your first date, the app puts every single waypoint on a separate date!! Who thought that was a good idea?! You can add things that are not on the map already, but you can only add an address, you cannot label the address as to what it is. There are a lot of things that are not included on the map that I would like to add to my trips. And label with a name. This app is not a standalone app. You need other sources to complete the picture. Especially because there is a blue line indicating your route that completely covers up the highway numbers. Highway numbers are essential to trip planning. Also, can you update the gas pricing? It‚Äôs no where near accurate. And organize the trips into past and upcoming/future? | G Maps and this nav system come up with  same routes which is not conducive for RVs.  The previous togo rv nav system was way better | Not easy to start navigation - ridiculously hard to do. | Interesting app. Paid the $60 fee and used it for a single road trip. Was pretty useful at setting up driving routes and ranges, similar to the old AAA TripTik. Found some good restaurants and museums along the way. 

But it has mediocre UI/UX. It dumps a bunch of OTHER people‚Äôs road adventures into the place where you store yours. Whenever you open it, you have to go digging for the trip(s) you‚Äôre working on because Roadtrippers figures you more likely want to see what others have done in an area you aren‚Äôt even visiting and that‚Äôs more important than your own trip! 

Think about asking a friend to hand you your hammer and instead they hand you random other tools in your box until eventually your hammer shows up. And they repeat that over and over. Wouldn‚Äôt be relying on that friend for help, even worse if I were paying them. And that‚Äôs how I feel about the experience of Roadtrippers- $60 a year to have it throwing up random adventures from other people when I bought it to focus on my own trip(s) is absurd. I can find plenty of these types of stories in more detail on YouRube or other websites- I‚Äôm paying for this subscription for a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù tool that focuses on MY road trips. Far too much noise and clunky navigation. 

The reason it went from a 3-star experience to a 1-star rating: apparently it‚Äôs rigged to make it impossible or near impossible to turn off the subscription. You follow a link from the app to log into their website, go to ‚Äúmanage subscription‚Äù or ‚Äúturn off auto renewal,‚Äù and it takes you to yet again ANOTHER website for a company called ‚ÄúStripe.‚Äù And does ‚ÄúStripe‚Äù let you manage your subscription or turn off auto renewal? NOPE. Stripe wants you to put in your email and they claim they will ‚Äúsend a link‚Äù so you can log in. And the link is good for 30 minutes. BUT- the link never arrives. Tried it twice. So, Roadpass/tripper and Stripe have apparently designed a rat trap where they can claim to let you turn off auto renewal, but there is no way to do so. 

Come the end of my subscription and if they try charging again, it‚Äôll be an instant chargeback with my bank. These sorts of schemes need to be called out for the fraud they are. And Apple may need to be advised this is going on behind the scenes, even though it‚Äôs a useful app, the trickery in preventing cancellation is abhorrent. | I was on auto renew. The price last year was 29.99 for unlimited plans with unlimited stops. It renewed for 35.99. Five more dollars, OK. But for three trips with 20 stops each. All the trios except for one have a lock sign on them, so the app isn‚Äôt even registering that I am a paying customer. There was no notice or email that the plan was changing. And of course no refunds. Will NOT be renewing | Used this app for the first time and it DID NOT take us to our Destination. Don‚Äôt trust it now and won‚Äôt use it again. Good thing my Trailer is on the small side or I would have had issues. | Killer app just learn how to used this app and it is worth every penny | This is annoying. I have logged out and logged back into my account but cannot see the trip I created on my desktop computer through the phone app. The phone app is not recognizing my user name or email and will not allow me to update it. Spent $60 on the annual membership for the premium package. | roadtrippers and campendium are supposed to be merged, but there is no campendium info here. | Very hard to understand what you actually have access to. Tried to sign up for all 4 apps but found out I only got Roadtrippers not Togo and Campendium like I wanted
Dallas Willard | Seems like developers might have forgotten about this project? I put in a 1,200 mile road trip and it couldn‚Äôt find a single gas station, a single hotel, almost anything really. It found 3 major historic land marks that almost everyone in the world has heard of‚Ä¶ so whats the point of this app then? And you want people to pay for something as well? It‚Äôs scary to see junk like this being advertised. Seriously, I feel like i‚Äôm living in the movie idiocracy sometimes. | Wow, I couldn‚Äôt even figure out how to use this app before I ran out of free tries and they wanted me to pay for the upgrade. Why do they assume you want to plan a trip starting from your house? I wanted to find out what things there were to do once I leave Austin on my way to Marfa in a couple of months. It kept putting my current location there and wouldn‚Äôt let me search between two points any other way. That‚Äôs how I lost all my free whatever they called them. Boo for this app. They don‚Äôt even explain how to use it properly! Nowhere at all do they explain me what I need to do. Going to delete it from my device! | Paid for a year because it looked like a cool app to help plan trips. I‚Äôve wasted so much time trying to learn it and never managed to get a trip planned. Most reviews on destinations are over 5-10 years old. Regretting paying for this!! Back to square one! | Whatever | The app as soon as you creat a account, you can‚Äôt do anything with a ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù I‚Äôd rather use Apple Maps. If I could give it a lower rating I would. | They bought some really good products and managed to screw them up . Overnight camping worked great now its almost worthless and some how most of the sights have disappeared overnight, pun intended | It appears that the subscription plans have changed, but I was still billed automatically for a tier that no longer provides access to my trips. I was auto billed $35.99 to renew my subscription, but now I can only view 2 of my trips. When I click on a lock icon covering all of my other trips, it prompts me to upgrade for an additional $50. I‚Äôve used this app for years, but no longer feel I can trust it. I‚Äôm out. | Best App ever for road trips | Please resurrect the standalone Campendium app. I don‚Äôt want or like RoadTrippers and fine the interface and review layout bloated and unhelpful. Campendium was clean and straightforward, achieving the goal of allowing me to easily find, judge, and choose campgrounds. Please admit your error and resurrect Campendium! | Very limited (Google map provides more for free) unless you pay their annual charge. | Are not visible once a trip is mapped. Can only see the type of highway‚Ä¶ interstate etc | This app has gone from 4 star to one star for me.  I am planning a trip now (February) for later this year and I cannot plan my route due to seasonal road closures.  The roads I need to take will be open during spring and summer months but I cannot plan my route now.   On top of this now the price goes up to $35 year.   I like this app but it is now not useful for me.   Especially now that the price is going up and I cannot plan my road trip.  I will be stopping my payment renewal. | Got road trippers so I could find camp grounds to stay over nightFirst time I go to use it I find out you have to have premium to find camp grounds | What happened???! Now you want to charge me even more for more trips and more stops? This makes me very upset - I went from unlimited access and now all my past trips are locked up and my current planning cannot add more stops because I‚Äôve reached 20 stops??!   WHAT??!! I LOVED Roadtrippers before this, but you‚Äôve lost a customer. I‚Äôve canceled my subscription. | Please fix the issue with the road numbers being hidden under the route lines on planned trips! | If you‚Äôre planning a road trip in Ireland, don‚Äôt bother with this application. | Love the app and how easy it is to add stops and find places to see. However, the exit and road numbers need to show on TOP of the blue route line. Cannot see the exit and road numbers and end up opening a different map app to see them. | I saved my own trip map long time ago, now I wanted to check it and I can‚Äôt, because I have to pay for membership to get my own information. I‚Äôd prefer delete the app with unexpected surprises. | We‚Äôve used Roadtrippers for a number of years & adventures with more on the way! Excellent for planning driving time/distance, discovering fun detours and exploring new places. We love the easy toggles for a quick change to turn off a waypoint and the ability to add dates to the route. All of our trips are saved with the year and name making it fabulously simple to look back with fond memories! YAY! | the options and features are promising but no matter how strong the WiFi and which browser i try everything loads like a black tank clogged with poop mountain | I used to love this app and used it a ton of times to plan our long road trips, but now it‚Äôs all glitchy and I keep getting error messages every time I try to add or remove a new waypoint. Very disappointing especially since I paid for the membership. | You can only add one stop and then you have to start paying for it. | Cannot get a live person to talk too. Roadtrippers did something to my account and can‚Äôt log on. And yes it‚Äôs good till December of 24. Had it for about 3 years and loved it till now. I guess time to find another vacation travel site. By contract, I have to keep Roadtrppers till December but I‚Äôm done | My dad showed me this app and now I‚Äôm hooked to plan out trips. Setting up is so easy to do and all the tools after playing around it‚Äôs really fun and easy to use | After Campendium was merged into this app i expected to see rich campground data like i did with Campendium premium. I won‚Äôt be renewing. | I have used Road Trippers for a few years. This renewal not only did the price increase, they made ‚Äútiers‚Äù! So while I paid $$ ($40 or so) it still has my trips I have spent months working on, locked for not paying for the ‚Äúpremium one‚Äù. Either I have to re start my road trips on a new app or pay road trippers even more money than I already paid for them to quit holding my trips hostage. 

I will never renew this subscription again due to this shady practice of theirs. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous and definitely not a way to keep people subscribing to your app. | This is my third and last year subscribing to this app.  When I went to renew this year, the price had almost doubled and instead of being allowed to plan 300 trips, I am only allowed to plan five.  So for $50 a year I can only keep 5 trips at a time, I didn‚Äôt understand that or I wouldn‚Äôt have renewed at all.  I used to put locations I would hear about in general trip for an area so that way I wouldn‚Äôt forget about the location when and if I was visiting the area but that‚Äôs no longer possible.  It‚Äôs a shame they had to get so greedy, this is no longer a good value for the money. | BEWARE:Roadtripper will lock you out of your trip, once you are part ways on your trip to force you to upgrade to their premium plan!  Not worth planning a trip with this app if it leaves you stranded.  I have a year subscription left, but will lose that money, since they locked me out half way through my trip. They are dirty bandits!!! | No customer service phone numbers only email which is frustrating when they have your account wrong yet they can‚Äôt figure it out. | Roadtrippers has ruined Campendium and I‚Äôm pretty bummed they will sunset that app for this crappy expensive one. I don‚Äôt care about road trip planning. I only care about finding campgrounds and Campendium did that in a straightforward way. I open the app, and there is a map using icons that make sense and are very legible. Could you at least steal the same interface from Campendium? And while I happily paid them $23.99/yr for that I won‚Äôt be paying a penny for Roadtripper when it renews in Sep ‚Äò24. And they want $60???!!!!! Also the emails have no instruction how to merge accounts. This is a horrible app merger functionally and financially. | To have used this app since around 2018/2019 and I have loved it, advocated for it and encouraged friends and family to upgrade for $30 per year. It was well worth it. I loved planning our trips, seeing fun things along the route and mapping out time. 

This year they doubled the price, I can no longer access all of those amazing trips I painstakingly spent hours creating. If you are going to increase the price you should at least be able to access the ones you previously planned without editing capabilities. I will no longer support or advocate for this app. What a disappointment. | If traveling in a country ar okay, but not if you have an Rv. | I plan an entire 14 trip into Canada and then log on and I have to pay a yearly payment to see the trip? What a waist of time, needless to say the features of app are lacking in general, POI‚Äôs aren‚Äôt even in the correct spot. What a stupid marketing plan to let people create a trip and then block them from seeing it unless they pay $49.99? Devs are clearly inexperienced and lacking basic app development skills. I‚Äôd suggest hiring a project manager with some experience in app rehabilitation. Good day, I‚Äôm gonna go find a better app. | I‚Äôm enjoying planning road trips on this. | Immediately starts pressing for upgrade and hinders the attempts to Delete the account | It has been now two years that I have made such amazing trips.
I have also recommend it to those who ask how I am making my vacation. Every year I make round trips . The best was Route 66. OMG what a trip that was. All because of being a member with Roadtrip.
From hotel reservations to visiting all the wonderful sights on the way.
Just write where, when and how many days you need.
If you want to make  the best vacation join RoadTripper.

Do not rely on | The only reason you would download this app probably is to check security checkpoint wait times. And that‚Äôs where this falls the most short. 

It only gives an average wait time across the entire airport. At the minimum it should give times  per terminal. In  places like DFW where each Terminal has multiple security checkpoints, even more specific information is needed.

The funny thing is, some airport websites are able to give this information, so the data is available. Just not in this app. | I just downloaded this app but on searching for the airports I will be using no results come back. Location services are set to always | It does not update at all. | App won‚Äôt even load the list of airports, useless | This app does not recognize the names of any airports so you can‚Äôt use it. | Tried put 20 or more US international airports the app doesn‚Äôt recognize any | The app will
Not allow nor recognize any airports that I put in-
Philadelphia. Tampa, etc‚Ä¶
Very confusing- | This review has nothing to do with the app. It Hass to do with a total disregard for my belongings. My bag was searched, therefore lost in Philadelphia, and when I got it back, my bag was broken in five places, and all my belongings in my bag were thrown in like it was garbage, they even broke a very special oil that I have for my skin. I agree and understand that the bags have to be searched randomly, and I want that to be the case but to totally disrespect my personal items and throw my clothes and other items in like they had been tossed in the garbage can is unacceptable. | This app is ‚Äústuck‚Äù on download and I can‚Äôt stop it and it won‚Äôt restart | Over all, I would recommend the app. Currently there are some bugs that do need addressed. 
Example: if you go to the tab for ask TSA on the iPad, if you click on the tsa website. The app crashes. On a cellphone it goes to the website.
That is just one example. 
To me not being able to access what you need could be a problem. That is why I give 3 stars. | was flying out of atlanta and the wait times are not accurate. I would not rely on this app for wait times! from my experience it seems that the individual airport website may have more real time information. i almost missed my flight, since the wait was around an hour, and showed 15-30 min on the app! | I was hoping this app would tell me what time TSA precheck closes, but no such luck | Apparently this doesn‚Äôt locate airports in other countries. Couldn‚Äôt find Pearson located in Canada. | The app told me 0-15 minutes when I entered TSA. When I exited 45 minutes later the app still said 0-15 minutes. It is safe to assume that the same mouth breathers that work the checkpoints also do a terrible job maintaining their app. | App says Checkpoints 1 and 4 are open for TSA PreCheck, but both are closed and Checkpoint 1 doesn‚Äôt open until 4am according to an airport worker. | Shows generic wait times for security check (I.e. 5 minutes for TSA-pre and 25 minutes for regular)‚Ä¶ got to my flight at EWR and found TSA-pre CLOSED, and a 55 minute wait time for regular. Numerous people freaking out about possibly missing their flight. Better to delete the app and just arrive 2 hours early like 2019. | I downloaded this to see the wait time for security lines. It said 0-15 minutes. We waited at least 45. 
Instantly deleted the app. | Won‚Äôt let you post times! | Told me 0-15 minute wait. Took over 3 hours and missed my flight | There is nothing accurate about this app. | Great app very helpful | Why does TSA think that having the security wait times for the entire airport makes sense when it varies terminal by terminal? You're better going to the websites that have figured all this out way better and way more effectively than this app. The first time I used it, the prediction was so off I deleted it right off my phone. | App said 0-15 minute wait‚Ä¶ in reality, line was over an hour. Not sure what technology they use to update wait times, but it‚Äôs awful! Deleted the app. | Wait times seem to be completely made up. Showed under 15 minutes at McCarran, actual wait time was 45+ minutes | Beware!! It showed DIA wait times as being ‚Äú15-30 mins‚Äù two different times several weeks apart. In reality, the wait was about an hour each time. I don‚Äôt trust this app at all. Shame on you, TSA, for providing wildly inaccurate info. | I try to choose Favorite Airports. Then suddenly the app flips from the list of airports to a specific airport. After that it‚Äôs over. I cant choose any more airports. So i can only choose 2 or 3 airports? | Does not accurately reflect times TSA actually open. Does not reflect real time wait times. | I use Atlanta all the time and it still shows busy times being under 15 minutes. 8:20 on a Friday it took almost 40 minutes to get through standard lines. If you know Atlanta, they had us lined up down the hallways between the elevators! I‚Äôve seen no way to leave notice on the app it‚Äôs self. It would be nice if the app was in real time. This isn‚Äôt the pandemic anymore, people are flying. Let‚Äôs get accurate times on the app | Doesn‚Äôt work. I tap on the items I‚Äôm searching and nothing happens. Disappointing, considering that‚Äôs why I got the app in the first place. | Used to work fine. Now states no network connection. I have a network connection because all other apps work fine. Have deleted and reloaded to no avail. Beats me | APP makes it hard to search for an airport to check security wait times.  The Search icon is buried.  

More troubling however is SIGNIFICANT errors in the airport look up.  Looking for the Pasco, Washington airport (PSC) and the APP offers only Endicott, NY which also is nick-named the Tri-Cities airport

Pasco is a much larger airport, the location where United Airlines started and perhaps the owner of the PSC designation much longer than the Endicott airport has existed.

App also fails to find the name‚ÄùPasco‚Äù

How many other basic search errors exist in the APP???? | Finally! More apps and websites need to do this. It really helps your company out-an attractive design can do nothing but draw in more users. | myTSA will be great for travelers if we get notification if someone got positive! This will be a great traveling tool! The new design is sick! Kudos to that! | I love the new design! The airports map is really helpful! I wish you have implemented this feature before. However, the feature that I was waiting for is still missing. Actual wait times live!! Hoping to see this on your next update! | Helo Woled Thana You For a supportive App | Very informative | Thanks for creating this. It makes traveling so much better!!! | Saves me so much time !!!!! Love it | During this time of COVID air travel, many of the TSA Pre lines are shut down due to lack of volume. The my TSA app, however, consistently shows these lanes open even though week after week they are closed and have been for months now. The app is worthless for actually showing your true status. | Lo | Was helpful but I wish they could give more info, I would recommend downloading your airlines app, I love using the delta app! I do like that you can see what you can and can‚Äôt bring. | Great professional crew   Thanks for being there. | Very long lines and wait times.  Need to be updated. | Kellee Edwards did a great job promoting this app. I will definitely use it when I start traveling more. | Great information. | the best thing ever it‚Äôs a great thing | App is showing wait time at SJU of
15-30 minutes it‚Äôs closer to 60 minutes. | The TSA app is amazing especially when you‚Äôre running late, it tells you if you‚Äôre going to be delayed and possibly miss your flight. Tell the TSA officers your timing can get you up front and you won‚Äôt miss that flight. üòÄüòÄüòÄ | No Pre-check after 21:00?

This app makes booking a quality trip so much easier ‚ô•Ô∏è | You make life so much easier to travel  grateful for this app | This app has opened me up to traveling to places I never thought of heading to before. | Las ofertas de viajes son f√°ciles de encontrar, es una app muy intuitiva ü©µ | Just downloaded it and it just shows a beach photo but doesn‚Äôt do anything else. | I used to love this app as well but not anymore they used to send me deal from New York City to Europe before they change I got a lot of deal send  by what‚Äôs app they stop doing that they came back sending deal by what‚Äôs app but is not from my departure city and all deal is not usa dollars. | Can we get one of the filters to be a home airport. Also can we get the filter to only allow so many miles from destination entered. | Ever since the last update I have been receiving two notifications for the same thing at the same time | Searching for flight NYC to DPS and cannot find anything close to the prices advertised.  Flights are $800+ not $585!  What gives? | App crashes when i try to scroll down to see other deals. I am on iOS 14. On IOS 13 it used to work fine.
I really like your app and check it out regularly for deals. Let me know when you fix the issue and i‚Äôll update the review to 5 stars. | This site has many limitations and unless they have a deal that may or may not apply to one‚Äôs situation, the rest of the selected deal are not any better, if not much worse, than other sites with one exception, the site is not user friendly at all. | Not working | Redirects you to a safari etc page to book whichever flight. Might as well save ur memory space and just use the mobile site. | Best B place to find remarkable deals on travel | Nice and smooth | I have yet to experience a deal that benefits me in TravelPirates. I will keep looking for that vacation that wows me as a deal breaker. | The best for vacation to use | It would be great to have additional Sf/Oak departures! | Great App, great deals! Easy to use.. | Travel pirates used to give the cheaper flight by the green dots on the calendar. Now when you try to choose dates the green dots aren‚Äôt there and makes harder to find ‚Äúcheap dates‚Äù to travel | Once you choose a destination you‚Äôd like to explore it is difficult to scroll. No matter where I put my finger it takes me to another page instead of scrolling. Quite irritating. | Amazing deals and so easy to use! Love it!!! | I love TravelPirates, this travel website have great sales to many places . I always helps me a lot when I‚Äôm planing vacations. | This application provides great information about traveling and great prices. | Only downside for me is there are hardly any deals out of Atlanta which is the busiest & largest airport, so I don‚Äôt really understand that. My niece was lucky enough to book a trip to Paris from Atlanta for dirt cheap.  Please find more deals from Atlanta | Been to Belgium, and Italy, and headed to Nee Zealand next month.  I‚Äôve had the best experiences finding reasonably priced trips that fit my schedule! | While the app works well, once you click on the deal and attempt to scroll through the dates/locations and prices it becomes overly sensitive that it opens the browser link before you can begin scrolling. The moment I touch the screen to try and scroll after getting off safari from it being automatically opened to go back to TravelPirate, it thinks I select whatever date and opens the browser again. Highly annoying and upsetting. | Not user friendliness. 
Hard to navigate. 
Have yet to find useful. | I like the website and the concept of this app but some things are just not intuitive like why can‚Äôt I just create an alert with the given departure airport only. I just want to get all alerts if a deal is available from ATL. | They used to do it from other major cities like Miami and Fort Lauderdale etc. Hopefully that comes back. | This is used to be my favorite app but now any flight deals shown are from NY or LA, I scroll and scroll and scroll and don‚Äôt find any deals from any other major cities . Very disappointed. | No deals out of San Francisco area. | Please show deals from more cities than NY. You Never show deals flying out of Philadelphia. | I suggests tailoring deals to your user‚Äôs location otherwise this app only serves those who live in NY. 
I would give 5 stars if I could see the deals in my area. | You can‚Äôt leave the app to go check a note or a website because it makes you start over. Who are the developers? Who is in charge. Amateurs. | Great application with great offers! | My suggestion to improve this app is to make a tool where people can sort the deals from their departure city.
Many times when I will check the deals, the price is complete different from where I live.
I believe many people has the same issue.

Thank you, 

Michelle | This use to be one of my favorite apps where I could always plan a quick trip. However, lately they only show deals departing from NYC. Since I haven‚Äôt seen a change I‚Äôm deleting the app, no longer beneficial to me. | Haven‚Äôt used it yet but I hope these are the right prices | This used to be my favorite app for the last few years. I would find myself checking it several times a day, and I have scored some pretty great deals.
Unfortunately, few months ago they shifted their focus mainly on departures out of NYC. They also don‚Äôt seem to be bothered with people‚Äôs feedback asking them to go back to including other, major cities like they used to. 
Will be looking for a new app, unless they go back to the old structure in the immediate future. | Most deals are for New York or California. Doesn‚Äôt really help me find deals | This used to be the best app for finding travel deals, with flights originating from multiple major cities. Now it only shows deals from New York City.  So 5 stars if you fly out of NY, everyone else,  look for a better app. | It‚Äôs really the only way to see the world. Went on a once in a life time vacation to Mauritius, last spring using travel pirates.it was amazing, I‚Äôm currently using it now to book my next vacation!ü§ôüèΩ | I've flown all around the world with travel pirates. I'm so grateful for this app and it's 100 percent legit. | Would probably be excellent app if it had flights flying out of all cities instead of just New York. | They falsely advertise prices and when you try to book it the prices are not what they are promoting the ‚Äúerror fare‚Äù is a lie they cancel your flight after you book it. Don‚Äôt waste your time on this app üëé | I used to enjoy this app but at some point in the last 6 months or so it started to only show vacations and flights from New York. I understand that it would take a while to find deals from EVERY US city, but at least include Chicago and a west coast airport. | Great site but unless you live in New York it‚Äôs not useful.

- We analyze air tickets - we compare prices and layover options, finding the cheapest air tickets and the most convenient flight options (direct or with a comfortable layover).
- Searching for air tickets doesn't take much time - we filter and sort all the options for you. And you can buy cheap air tickets. How do you like the idea?
- You can subscribe to notifications about the cheapest air ticket, the most convenient one or the most direct flight (yes, this is possible as well). This way you can keep track of changes in the cost of plane tickets. As soon as the price changes, we will send you a notification.
- But these are not all of the subscriptions! You can also subscribe to the search for air tickets from your city and catch cheap tickets for a plane that flies in the most unexpected direction. What a surprise!
- We also have a ""Price Schedule"" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.
- And the ""Price Map"" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.
- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.
- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.
- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).
- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.
- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.

By the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:

- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.
- Guided and self-guided tours.
- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go

The developer Aviasales does not accept responsibility for the unethical business practices of their partners, claiming to only be a search engine. However, despite this they still act in bad faith as they continue to allow their users to be taken by bait and switch practices. 

What everyone else has already stated is absolutely true, they get you with a low price, and then when you ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù said ticket it‚Äôs not actually a ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù at all, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúreservation‚Äù in which they will tell you that the ticket prices have suddenly jumped $100+.

There were only three tickets left so we tried to hurry. There was a slight price increase hit customers service was quick to let us know and make a decision on the increase. Thanks | Ok I‚Äôve been using this app for 3 years now. If you need an app that gathers info from multiple airlines so you can get the best price, period, this is the one. No issues or whatsoever. Very straightforward and neat UI. 10/10 would recommend. | I loved jetradar and recommended it to so many people but they need to try and work with these flight sites better. Recently my mom and brother has booked through them only to get their flight canceled and then rebooked and then canceled again and forced to pay another price. I realize this is jetradars fault but they need to not include these companies and update the Info correctly. These sites were myholidays and flight mojo. | I bought a plane ticket using this app, and was charged but was never sent a confirmation email or ticket number. Did I get scammed? I‚Äôm not seeing any way to contact Aviasales. | This app is full of bad news. It directed me to a scam sit called MyHoliday. Just another site that lets you book flights. Turns out it‚Äôs all a scam. You pay for it and they‚Äôll say they‚Äôre sending the tickets to you but later will call and tell you that there‚Äôs something wrong and have to pay more. After that, they block your number. I feel dumb for falling for this. It‚Äôs ridiculous that this app still stands. As said again. Please avoid this app at all costs. | Advertise and check out with one price, call to tell you they cannot honor advertised price and need more money. 

Checked that app and while the price had gone up, it was still showing lower than what was requested on the phone. 

Only time I‚Äôve ever felt the need to leave a review, would not recommend.

Edit: shortly after posting the review supervisor called and said there was an error, and I received the call by mistake and my price would be honored. You decide for yourself. Review changed from 1 to 3 stars to reflect that. | 0 star.
 Apple store should take off this app.

I booked a flight as $188, and I got email from this company saying my flight with American Airlines is successful and paid. 
But I couldn‚Äôt found my reservation at American Airlines at all. 
These guys - cheap fair may - are scammers! | Don‚Äôt book here I was scammed earlier out of 114$ this is a shame I had to go to Priceline to get a ticket | DON‚ÄôT USE THESE SUCKERS 
THEYRE SCAMMERS | I booked a flight through this app and they scammed me and took my money, then told me my flight increased by $80 when I went online and booked with another company for a cheaper price. I requested to get a refund and the company instead told me to pay extra and just buy the ticket which I didn‚Äôt, they completely ignored my request for a refund and I‚Äôm extremely disappointed I didn‚Äôt think this app would allow scamming businesses to work through it. I‚Äôm deleting this app completely. Do not download!! I‚Äôm also reporting this app to Apple | Me parece q la app anteriormente estaba perfecta esta actualizaci√≥n q le hicieron es un asco y ese nombre tambi√©n nuevo por Dios echaron a perder la app jetradar ü•∫ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Cancel my trip without letting me know,
Horrible customer service 
Ruined my vacation | Love love love Jetradar ~ don‚Äôt know that I like new name but the format is the most efficient bottom line value resource I‚Äôve saved plenty as a result of their good work 
    Thx | When it was jet radar I got great deals but ever since Aviasales took over I keep getting referred to websites that the price doesn‚Äôt stand. I tried three times today and every site has contacted me back saying the price has changed, so they may not be a scam but they definitely don‚Äôt check their sources anymore | So y all  take my money and cancel it tell me this is a joke by taking people‚Äôs money like that y all better send my money now or tell me y all going to fixed this 

Please note that your booking is cancelled. | The app sends you to Cheapflightsfreaks. I had the worst experience with this company and don‚Äôt recommend anyone to use this company unless you are 110% sure you are traveling. This 110% also includes if the world üåé is going to end because they will not refund your money and if they do they will keep a large amount of it. I bought a round trip flight ‚úàÔ∏è while the pandemic üò∑ was low. Once the cases started going up all around the world the airlines made changes to the schedule flights and according to the airlines rules the changes were considered major changes and gives me the option to cancel with a full refund. so I decided to cancel the flight and obtain a full refund because of the major changes and since I was traveling with my family and the Covid were going up worldwide. I contacted this company since I bought the tickets with them and explained the situation. After a long time on the phone and many calls I finally got a partial refund. They kept over $700 dollars for no reason even though the airlines issue a full refund since they made the changes. They make you agree to their terms if you want the partial refund. Worst customer service and company I dealt with. Is better to go with the airlines. Stay away üëé | This is definitely the best way to find flights on mobile. Google flights doesn‚Äôt have an app and AviaSales (formerly JetRadar) is awesome. I would rank the apps like this:

1. Google Flights/ITA Matrix
2. AviaSales
3. Skyscanner
4. Momondo
5. Kayak

I have found so many great flights with this app and turn to it first while traveling, because I don‚Äôt carry a computer! | This app gives you higher priced than any other. Priceline , Expedia, orbitz... direct through the airline are all preferable. Do not waste your time. People should have to have a verified purchase Before the ability to leave a review. How hard do you think it is got an app developer to create tons of reviews for themselves. This app wasted my time. There‚Äôs no price match guarantee so there you have it. | I need cheaper flight | I bought a ticket and I did not receive my conformation or e-ticket. It took FOREVER TO GET MY MONEY BACK! It ruined my birthday trip. | I had been using this app for years with great satisfaction. It found the best prices of the others I‚Äôd tried.

With it, no one could take advantage of me, because of my ignorance of the the peso. There is,however, a slight difference with the apps value of the American dollar, than the actual value of the peso. But not much. I was able to negotiate some of my purchases, by knowing the ball park figure of what I was buying.

You can easily switch direction of conversion with one button, i.e. from U.S. to UK and vice versa.
Love this! | Great apps | This app is great for converting usd to colones used in Costa Rica! | The app is alright. It doesn't let me paste values, so I often find myself retyping a number I already have in the clipboard... Also the UI is slightly confusing, especially switching the currencies I often press the ""switch"" button subconsciously after I type in a value, thinking it's the confirm/equals button.
Also it doesn't remember the currencies I frequently need to calculate.

Only complain is that it only saves up to a few of  countries we‚Äôve used ever.  
All the currencies we‚Äôve used should be saved so that we don‚Äôt have to go through the whole searching, typing the country‚Äôs & locating again. Thanks. | The exchange rate is off. | Traveling through a few different countries and I‚Äôm trying to use the favorites setting to quick save the different conversions I may need. No matter how many different ones I add, they all revert to the current one I‚Äôm on. If I convert MYR to USD, then check my favorites. They‚Äôve all switched to that conversion.

If I add a new one, it takes the new countries currency and converts it to the previous countries currency, example: MYR to USD, then I go into favorites to check Indonesian to USD, all my other pre-saved conversions have swapped to MYR to USD. If I add a new one like Indonesian, it swapped to Indo - MYR. Not my construes currency I need.

Google maps has had me outside 2 am lost in random neighborhoods sending me back on the interstate and then circling me back around the same neighborhood! Constantly rerouting for no good reason! Sending me places that are nowhere near my destination! Smh the first couple times yes ok but at this point it is ridiculous as I am currently lost again at this very moment as to why I am HIGHLY frustrated while writing this! Bums walking up to my car strange guys in the parking lot and I‚Äôm parked because I‚Äôm lost and there are no near gas stations so I‚Äôm at this McDonald‚Äôs til I download another app that will help get me to my destination! Thanks for nothing and multiple times of high anxiety frustrating situations if I could give Google maps ZERO stars I would! | Bring back the Easter Egg Hunt and I‚Äôll change it to a five star review!!! Plz we are begging you. | We watch pets for a living and could not survivor without Pristine‚Ä¶they make our our house perfect every time! | Thank you Janet for taking the time to assist me with my reservation and for showing me my unit! | I hate your maps Update: 9-7-23 I hate your maps even more

Update 3-28-24. Even more | LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP !!! Great job google !!! Only map I use !! | Ryan was very helpful make this very easy for me thank you so much Ryan | I couldn‚Äôt have done anything on my phone with these guys. They were patient with my husband and I. They went through every step. Thank goodness for good workers

Ronald, Kenny, Trey and Jaden | I have been privileged to be a customer for a couple years now. Snyders has always been honest, reliable, professional and reasonable. Richard just left my house and did a warranty replacement on a 9 year old unit that wasn‚Äôt purchased from Snyders! He came out and got the warranty completed within 2 days of finding damage. He kept my unit running without issues and the unit has never worked better! I am truly grateful to have people and a company like Snyders AC. This is the only AC company to use!! Thanks Richard!! | Why would you remove the in app browser? So silly | My guy, using google maps is like using a map a toddler made. | Seems like the app will always NOT suggest the easiest way. Yesterday the app suggested I take a train uptown just to take another train downtown to get to my destination, when taking another train is way easier and takes half the time - it did suggest I take that route - in 2 hours. 

My friend is trying to get to the city from the airport and the easiest way is not recommended. Not sure what‚Äôs happening but this app is drunk. | Now it‚Äôs broken in CarPlay. The screen is blank except for the blue line of your route and the arrow for your car. When I unlock my phone and open the app it goes back to normal. | Unfortunately 7 | Used to be very useful but now the app doesn‚Äôt tell you the street names. Merely saying to turn left in a half mile is not very helpful. It forces you to drive while looking at your phone, which defeats the whole purpose. Apple maps will be my new go-to | The touchpad zoom function (on ipad) was disabled with a recent update | You make my life easy. I‚Äôm indebted. Thank you for everything. | I don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt turn off immersive view. I have no interest in an unwanted video playing in the corner any time I ask for directions that just chews data. I want to be able to opt in if I want rather than not be able to opt out. | Ever since the crash in this March Google maps will not update in real time. I can‚Äôt count on it at all when traveling. If I could give zero stars, I would all of my location settings and privacy settings are set correctly and it still will not work. | How many times I have to update this app | Khan | Annoying that you constantly have to update. | This app NEVER works when you need it to. | Don‚Äôt use it unless Apple Maps doesn‚Äôt work it literally takes you thought the longest roads ever and makes you waste time. | –í–∞—à–∞ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ —Ç—É–ø–∏–ª–∞ —Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –µ—â–µ –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ —Ç—É–ø–∏—Ç. –ú–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ —á—É—Ç—å –ø–æ –ø—Ä–æ—à–µ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å. –ö–æ–æ–¥–∞ —É–∂–µ –Ω–∞—Å–Ω–µ—Ç–µ –æ –ª—é–¥—è—Ö –¥—É–º–∞—Ç—å –∞ –Ω–µ —Ü–µ–ª—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å —Å–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å —Ö—É–π–Ω–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞—Ç—å. | Garbage software full of loopholes, the platform is full of spam and fake listings nobody cares. they‚Äôll hurt your business and ignore all suggestions. Take advantage of their monopoly so they don‚Äôt care much about it. | So not use google maps gives wrong location ruined ppl relationships with wrong location would not recommend this app use apple not google maps | Wrong 99% of the Time | He came right on schedule, let me know he was on his way which was so nice. He changed my pilot light on my furnace and walked me through the process so I knew what he was doing and why. He is coming back later to do a maintenance on my AC. Very professional, they were highly recommended to me. | Excellent service fixed my friends phone! Definitely recommend | In the last few months,  I find that using google map has become very confusing rerouting users on longer roads. It also has become harder to manage using Siri, because the map does not show right away. 

I suggest that Google FIRSt shows the shortest way to reach a destination and quickly! I hate to see unfamiliar routes, and at least 40-50% of the time now, google did not give me the fastest route and has led me into places that are dangerous and at times give directions that goes around in circle. Such a waste of time.

I sometimes think the entire system is being hacked and people can control your route. | 1. ËΩ¶Â≠êÂú®ËæÖË∑Ø‰∏äÊó∂ÔºåÂØºËà™‰ºöÂºïÂØº‰∏äÈ´òÈÄü‰∏ªË∑ØÔºåÂç≥‰ΩøÂæàÁü≠ÁöÑË∑ùÁ¶ªÔºåÁÑ∂ÂêéÂèà‰∏çÂæó‰∏ç‰∏ãÈ´òÈÄüËøõÂÖ•ËæÖË∑ØÔºåËøô‰∏™ËÆæËÆ°‰∏çËÅ™Êòé„ÄÇ

It‚Äôs every single time. It can be even within the same day or same week. | We don‚Äôt need ads on the map. | Accurate guide, estimates & live traffic info | So far they‚Äôve updated it correctly and made LA a safer city. Much luv | If you are looking for a hairstylist that works with blonde hair,  go to Angie. She made an amazing job in my hair. She is the best.  Thank you Angie for the transformation you made me today. I loved it. | SHAZIA is an awesome PT who is always upbeat delightful and pleasure to work with. She has helped me with my shoulder rehabilitation and  is well versed in all the exercises that helped strengthen it and return to optimal condition. I strongly recommend SHAZIA to anyone in need of PT. Also I am out and out impressed with Iqba and Chantel‚Äôs professionalism and they are highly friendly and skilled. | The homepage of the app is way too cluttered and not easy on the eye | The best!!! | A huge thanks to the Boulder Cars team for being a reliable used car resource in Boulder County!  When I shared my needs, Kory and team were immediately engaged finding the right car to fit my profile. I‚Äôve been driving my new car for almost month now and am beyond happy with both the quality of car I purchased and the attention to detail the Boulder Cars team provided me in the experience. | This new version is so much less visually appealing. Please give an option for the old look | $1.50 will do less than half your car. Took $10 to do a $3.00 job. Will never be back! | It's great map to use, one thing I can't stand is when it suggests another route in the middle of trip which can only save you 1 or 2 minutes. 1st of all what does a minute(or 2) save you when you are on 2 to 3hrs drive? Also the worse part of that is, it will minimize your map and asks you to accept or decline the the option, I find this is very dangerous especially when you are driving on highway with the speed of up to 60m/hr.
I hope google stop doing for the safety of drivers and their passengers. | Best app ever from the beginning ü¶æ | excellent place and environment to live! I love being here | Your satellite is very net clear | Las personas encargadas de hacer el delivery tienen cero ganas de hacer lo que hacen. Te dejan las cosas en la casa como quieren sin mostrar un m√≠nimo de customer services. P√©sima actitud y forma. | I used to depend to Google Map, but now it has been so bad that Im thing of remove it from my iPhone::(1) Warning the turns/exit too late, I missed my exit several time.  (2) Sending  me to the wrong place several times. The strange thing is it used to be good, but some updates in the past screwed up the good directions to my house.

Ability to find community through recommendations and get a real time look in at what people are doing across the world. | Explain for the life of me why Philadelphia is not listed. I see South Philadelphia and Philadelphia county and someplace called new Philadelphia. I don‚Äôt see Center City Philadelphia or just simply Philadelphia in general I don‚Äôt understand. | This app has a great concept for planning trips, however is very slow when searching destinations to add. | Very glitchy - takes a long time to load. Shows all results of things to do, after you put in the location, to places in completely different countries!! | The map feature only shows you the most recent 10 recommendations. To see them all I have to scroll and load each recommendation which takes FOREVER. And when I click into any recommendation, I lose my place and have to start over. So it‚Äôs virtually impossible for me to actually see all my recommendations laid out. So disappointing, I‚Äôll have to just use google maps | Before you begin there is a short questionnaire which asks who you are traveling with. I put family and children, yet when I inserted my travel destination and had an itinerary generated, it recommended things that were not kid friendly.

Additionally, the questionnaire asks what your budget looks like. Although I chose the lowest bracket, it recommended five star restaurants that were completely unaffordable for me. 

There were a couple hidden gems in the recommendations, but overall it isn‚Äôt worth the space it would take up on my phone unless some more moms joined the community to beef up the kid and budget friendly recommendations. | Looking for a great planning tool that allows you to share with others in your group. This is the one, nice layout and many recommendations for your area of stay. | I could not for the life of me figure out how to see any reviews for places in a city. Whoever designed the ui for this app should be fired. | I want to live this app but it‚Äôs certainly glitching on me. I‚Äôm clicking on what I know is a restaurant I have saved in San Fran and it‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs a beach. | Great to find people who like what you like, so you can get a better idea of what you may like in new places.

I‚Äôve added a bunch, and the location are off. For example, upstate NY is occasionally included in NYC and 2 of my Japanese restaurants in NYC are being listed as a cathedral location. | I love the concept of the app, but some features don‚Äôt work or don‚Äôt have a real purpose. It‚Äôs really hard to just search an area without looking at someone else‚Äôs list. When you search something and add it to a list, the UI just throws you back to a random place and you have to start your search over again. Needs some work on user experience, but I‚Äôll keep using and hope bugs get fixed! | People use Apple Maps for the same use as an app like this. This is just a places finder. So no point and not recommended. | So excited to use this app! Look me up and share your travel tips! @bohemianspirit | I love this app‚Äîso helpful for planning trips! If I have one suggestions, it‚Äôs that I wish you could add comments/reminders to yourself when you add a place to a trip (e.g., what dish everyone loves at a restaurant). I think you can‚Äôt add notes like that when you‚Äôre planning, only once you‚Äôve marked it as a recommendation. | I use OOO both for finding new restaurants and as a quasi-travel diary so when I go back to a city I can remember my own favorites! 

With fake reviews / AI seeming to be on the rise on other sites, it‚Äôs fantastic that OOO allows you to filter by reviews of people you know. | I love this app, but I think it‚Äôs going to take some updates and improvement before this app becomes trendy. Users should be able to categorize places manually because some of them are incorrect‚Äîe.g., it lists one of my hotels as something to ‚Äúdo‚Äù instead of as a place to stay‚Äîand there is no way to change it. I also saved a recommendation in Utah and it is showing up as a location in Michigan. But I would love to see this app grow and for more people to start using it, it has such awesome potential!! | You‚Äôre only able to make itineraries with limited items. I work really hard to find hidden gems so it doesn‚Äôt really make sense that I can make an itinerary using only the most popular spots | The best way to make the perfect itinerary for all your stops & trips üòç | Love all the features so far, but how can I make a reservation as I don‚Äôt see how you do it using open table. Is a booking feature coming soon? | Not only is the brand name perfect. I love how the app is designed and it‚Äôs features. I can definitely see this app being a must have for travellers with a few extra features. 
I use it to plan my trips and save my must go to places. It‚Äôs been super handy! 

I would love to see a option on the trips section to share the itinerary via PDF. I can imagine it would look perfect to share with friends who don‚Äôt use the app or if you are planning a trip for a family member. 

Keep up the great work! I‚Äôm a super fan! Finally an app that not only is pretty but also super useful ü´∂üèº | I love this app. Just starting to use it and I am in love with the My trips part of it. Love being able to add places of interest with times for each day! The only thing is that some of the places I rec show incorrect info on my page. I recommended a place in Utah Wyoming and the final place on my place is showing Ann Arbor, MI. Another is showing incorrect town with a picture that had nothing to do with my review.  Also the feedback does not work on the app. Unable to send any feedback. | EDITS:
Would also love to see the ability to add a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù item- for example: hop-on, hop-off bus tours. Would be super helpful to leave a review and just save my pictures and notes from the experience for keepsakes.

This could easily be the next big social media craze, especially with travel coming back! I love the concept: plan and document all my trips in one place, with ability to recap them in the perfect mix of photos and written descriptions, WITH A SCHEDULE :) so I can easily pass down detailed plans. Amazing. BUT, there are definitely features missing before it can go viral‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd love to see: - The ability to add photos to a place just for you/even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äúrec‚Äù a place, so I don‚Äôt have to post personal pictures to the internet if I want to use it like a social network with a cute recap of me and my partner on a trips‚Äô pictures for our friends and family. This would go along great with better privacy/sharing settings, so I can share my trips and photos and comments/notes with people, allow others to add comments who are tripmates and maybe a ‚Äúview only‚Äù tier with public/private comments for what I want a friend to be able to see (if someone from work asks for trip recs, but maybe I don‚Äôt want them to see my reservation notes on a place but do want them to see my review). | As a travel agent, I LOVE using this app to build trips for my clients. Once all of your activities/hotels/restaurants are loaded, my clients are able to click on the itinerary and everything shows up on the map in their app, which saves them  TONS of time from having to Google everything individually outside the app. Super trendy, modern, and unique recs from all the users. Such a fun travel space to be in! | Amazing for travels recs and finding new places.  I‚Äôve been sending lists of my recs for years and now this makes it so much easier to share with friends! | I hope more people use it, such a cool idea | A really awesome function that should be incorporated in to this beautiful app would be a visually appealing countdown feature for ‚ÄúMy Trips‚Äù. A bonus would be the ability to create a Home Screen widget for your countdown as well! | So much potential. I got so excited for this app and to use it but has a few problems. This is my first ever review on here because guess what? Your feedback option does not work. You click on submit and does nothing. Do you guys not test your app after updates?
Also, does anybody who works for this app ever use it at all? If so, you can easily catch the glitches and what needs to be fixed. For example, when you click the ‚Äúback‚Äù button, it doesn‚Äôt really go back to the previous page you‚Äôre on. When i am checking out another person‚Äôs profile, clicks on their recs, and then tries to go to back to their page, it doesn‚Äôt. It leads me back to my profile! It is so annoying. Please fix this. The app is way too focused on ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù but has no quality. Way too many problems. | I love this ap!! I love having lists for all my trips in one place, love the aesthetic, & the map feature ! 

I would LOVE to be able to make my own notes for businesses that only I can see. That way any research I‚Äôve done on the place can be there too. For example- a place that doesn‚Äôt take reservations for breakfast, I‚Äôd like to note that :) | Love the look and design of this app, and the concept and information you get for trips is amazing!! Really helpful to create your own trip folders or wishlists all in one place with pictures, location etc etc. convenient and helpful to get you to all the places you‚Äôre wanting! 

The docked star is due to some interface annoyances through using the app. When clicking into someone‚Äôs recommendation from a trip and clicking the back arrow it brings you all the way back to the search page rather than that person‚Äôs trip to continue looking through their reccos. So you have to find your way back to where you were if you want to continue browsing. | Love this concept and the ease of use of the app. As a business owner, I wish there was a way we could edit information that isn‚Äôt correct, such as hours of operation. I understand the concept is for this to be different than Yelp, just wish we could provide accurate information. | This app is a beautiful way to plan trips and to remember past trips. | So helpful to see hometown recommendations! Love love love this app and can‚Äôt wait to see all the new features that get added üôåüèΩ | As someone who loves traveling and giving recs, this is perfect. Still needs some things worked out,   Like my profile picture and background photo do not load or show? probably a bug issue. Also I would love it if you were able to have a tab with a grid of all the photos you‚Äôve took at locations, similar to Instagram, and the ability to change the main photo on your profile of trip locations. Otherwise great app can would love to see this grow | While I‚Äôm pretty proud of the state of my travel spreadsheets, this app blows them away. The social aspect, easily saving and sharing ideas with friends, make planning so much easier. | Pros:
+ GPS enabled search
+ Clean, intuitive functions
+ Collaborative space

Cons:
- does not map from location to location
- there‚Äôs no default view of a trip to show the entire itinerary, you have you click day by day 
- you can‚Äôt share trips to Instagram stories, there should be an attractive easy display for sharing on social media 
- there is no FAQ or feedback section in the app to suggest changes 
- you cannot make notes about a location or place you select for your trip, therefore I still prefer using notes over this app until it adds features

I am happy to use this app for an upcoming trip and will provide an updated review if the app features are updated. | I love this concept! The app is super easy to navigate and fun to use. I love logging all of the places I‚Äôve been to, because it both helps give people I know recommendations, and it gives me a nice memory bank of where I‚Äôve been. I used this to plan a recent trip, and it was such a neat way to keep track of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do. Love the map feature to see where in a city my friend‚Äôs recommendations are, and to find where my next stop is on vacation! | Love all the features so far. Genius idea!! When I‚Äôm planning trips, especially international trips, I use google maps to organize the itinerary based on location and proximity. I‚Äôm def gonna start inviting friends to join to make our lives easier. 
 For more effective itinerary planning, I would suggest adding the following:
1. Times
2. Option to add attachments, videos or images because some of the images don‚Äôt do these places justice)
3. Finally notes within scheduled places (as shown in the previews) and also notes to add activities that are not listed. 

I also love how the map shows the proximity of places to each other but is it possible to add a feature where we can see the actual distance from one place to another and perhaps driving directions? Currently, google maps only opens for directions to one place. | truly changes the game | Really great concept and I love the user friendliness. However, each time I try to see a list of someone‚Äôs recs on their page (or even my own), the recs do not load. The only way I can see recs is by searching a city right now. Needs an update probably

UPDATE: it works fine. This ^ was only happening for a few hours the first day. Really cool app! | Great for planning trips and sharing recommendations with friends! | It‚Äôs so awesome that you can put locations on the day you plan to visit but why not add time? It‚Äôs not a full function collaboration or trip planing tool if you can‚Äôt plan times in your day. | Cool app. Will definitely be using in future travels. Just wish there was an option to add your own photos and notes. Could possibly make this option private or public for others to see. | There are many things I love about this app. I just started using ‚Äúplan my trip‚Äù.  
Not only am I adding all the places/ things I want to do as I prepare but this will also serve as a record for me for future,  Have u ever tried to remember that little restaurant you had stumbled across but couldn‚Äôt. Just park it here. | Love the app, such a great concept, very user friendly, and very great aesthetically. Just one thing- please make an update where you can make folders within each city of recommendations so that we can distinguish between food recs/activities/shopping, etc. Right now they are all in one category under each city and I‚Äôm afraid my recommendations will get lost in the sauce and get confusing if I keep adding to it! Would love a bit of organization and categories within each city. Thank you! | I‚Äôm already obsessed with the app as-is. It‚Äôs been. A very practical, helpful tool for trip research & planning - especially for group trips with friends or family. I don‚Äôt have a ton of friends on the app yet, so my planning process is still to go to Pinterest or travel blogs for ideas and then I save my wishlist things to do in Out of Office. If they keep building out additional features that make it more useful, building a user base I want to follow, and create more opportunities for engagement across users, this app will be an absolutely must have for anyone who enjoys a trip! | I love to see what friends and influencers that I follow are doing when they travel. Places to stay, eat, sights to see! I sometimes DM people and ask but this makes it so much easier especially when planning a trip and giving others recommendations. 10/10 recommend! | This is hands down one of the most beneficial travel apps I have ever used. For someone who loves to travel the reviews and recommendations have been spot on! Can‚Äôt wait to use the app on my next trip! | A user friendly interface that‚Äôs so easy to use! And because I trust my friends (and some influencers), it makes picking my hotel or restaurant so simple! Why didn‚Äôt someone think of this sooner? (Love the name, btw) | The reviews and recommendations have been great - love being able to follow friends (and their friends) and family and get their advice on where to eat, stay, and visit. Much , much better than the other travel info sources available where random people give input. Already using it for planning vacations and also for enjoying the city I live in - finding new places right in my own town I had never heard abou!!!",4.85409,3091,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a5/86/90/a5869022-b96d-2390-9ea5-e6488c9db741/1c23d18a-0122-40d0-b094-cf75e9771f8a_5.5_-_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/23/da/59/23da59fc-9dfa-f844-9f57-fa7bc0b94cf0/7cb626d7-8619-4f2d-a096-9131382302a0_5.5_-_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/80/cd/aa/80cdaaf6-61d9-9657-5185-6a2eb44d8744/8585b7a1-896d-4e06-a35d-0157f53054b9_5.5_-_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/7e/91/60/7e916084-f29b-3b48-9026-623f60f87163/688918db-fd62-4108-b57f-d610b75f06a6_5.5_-_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e5/ef/e1/e5efe100-0c1a-dacf-72e3-def3c8bee1b2/a854fc0f-3047-426f-8633-9dc12d2cc6f8_5.5_-_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/be/fd/68/befd682b-e9a8-c5f6-655c-9a9aef12ad64/3ae7c7ca-0557-4980-9828-aef144c5dfad_5.5_-_6.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The ad states that time begins after scanning the the 1st attraction. Our tickets ended at midnight the next day. We were cut off the next day at midnight. Deceitful practices | We did the 2 day pass.. family of 6.. did Universal on day 1.. you have to reserve the morning of the day you plan to visit.. did it, they scanned my phone, no problems.. second day kids wanted to do knotts.. you have to show your passes at both 11/ 12 and they exchange for paper tickets.. same thing, no issues.. highly recommend! Saved so much money! Just pay attention to which attraction you want and follow their admittance rules and you‚Äôll be fine.. will be purchasing again wherever we go!! | This has been nothing but a headache we purchased discounted tickets through Groupon and it was horrible. You can‚Äôt reach anybody on Groupon only through a text it took me an hour back-and-forth to get the right confirmation code and then we made reservations for Statue of Liberty and only a couple reservations went through. It has been nothing but a headache. I suggest go straight through Go City, and I actually talk to a human that will help you guide you all this hassle. Just save a couple dollars is not worth it. | The older version can add attraction to a specific date with Morning, Afternoon and evening option. Now, all selected events are unscheduled and cannot do anything else. Need to fix this! | one day only 2 attractions, almost same price for two regular price, but on your own pace and condition, | They have a ‚Äúsavings guarantee‚Äù but it‚Äôs only if you book 3x a day which is virtually impossible. I used it for 3 days to get premium offers. One of them cancelled on me due to weather. I did the math and I would have saved money if I would have booked everything individually 2 events a day. | Lousy info and customer service | Information on their website is outdated and the customer service is lousy | Don‚Äôt even think about using this service. They are overpricing. I bought the tickets for Rome for 3 activities worth $100 and the total entry fee for the very same tickets if bought individually were less than $50. They claim they give you up to 35% which is a flat out lie. | ‚ÄúIf it is too good to be true, it probably is‚Äù. At first look you would feel they provide better value for money. However, most attractions will treat you like a freeloader. I took a two say pass for miami. And the pass stated ‚Äújust show up and show the pass‚Äù. But Most of the good attractions mentioned they only allow limited people from gocity pass. That means each day, if you go early, you can get one to one good attraction and by the time you finish it all the other ones are sold out. Their customer service is horrible and do not honor the misleading claims stated in the pass. They offered us a partial refund provided we go to multiple attractions and prove that none of them is accepting go city pass. That makes no sense given our valuable time of lost in the process. That said, it is still worth it if you plan to go to multiple attractions. I got a 50% discount on the pass. So covering 4 attractions from the list of 40+ attractions (some are far away from miami and some are not worth your time) will make up for the cost. So plan to book and pay directly for the main attractions like speedboat and if you did end up taking a pass, use it for the less popular attractions. Always call ahead and try to book it as much as possible. | Don‚Äôt buy the pass the day you arrive thinking you can use it. It apparently has to go through security checks which takes about 6 hours so now we are here waiting with nothing to do since this was our plan today. I called and they ‚Äúflagged our order‚Äù to be processed sooner but still will take hours. Absolutely ridiculous!!! They don‚Äôt advertise this and I‚Äôve been to many other cities using go passes and never had to wait to receive it! | Made accessing attractions quick and easy | The app is glitchy. On initial load- the app looks like it‚Äôs struggling to refresh and it‚Äôs stuck on a loop doing so. | Everything tells you to make a reservation right? You can only do it same day. Customer service is non existent, I‚Äôve seen 5 year olds with better manners and customer service skills.
Was told no problem as soon as we get confirmation you didn‚Äôt go we will redo the tickets. No call, no email. I called back to be told they can not help me. HORRIBLE DO NOT USE! | When you open the map it opens the wrong address. Made us miss a cruise. | We just got 4 go city passes for 3 things to do and in an hour and a half they now say expired and we haven‚Äôt even used them once | Title says it all, planned a vacation around a cruise but they had no indication that it was close for the entire weekend we went. Probably won‚Äôt use it again. | I saw the promises this app made and was skeptical; it just sounded too good to be true. This app is 100% worth getting. We were able to save $50 with this (we did the 2 day all inclusive). Absolutely get this app if you can | I and my family used the All Inclusive pass and had a blast in Boston!!! We went through sooooooooo many places and there was no hassle of waiting in line or worry about ticket.
The best thing about this was after the whole trip, I calculated the saving of about $1200.
Yeah, next trip to Hawaii!!!!!!!üòÜüòÜ | Lowered the review because it asks to rate all the time | I have had nothing but problems using this app! | Tried to purchase from their website, won‚Äôt accept payment.  Called the help line, they said use the ap they apparently no longer accept web payments.   Used the ap, get ‚Äúunknown failure‚Äù message with 2 different credit cards.   Guess my money is not worthy of their product. | Could have bought tickets cheaper on my own! | Can‚Äôt sync my passes to my email or app. | This pass is useless in Amsterdam. The pass doesn't book tickets so you have to make reservation online with the sites, but you can't pay for the reservations with the pass. Either you chance it and hope that when you arrive you can get in with your pass, or you pay separately and the pass is worthless. DO NOT go without reservations because you will not get in. The sites cost less than the pass in total. And the ferry to the castle was closed entirely so we got stuck 10 miles from the castle without a way back. The Uber cost $70 round trip. Absolutely a waste of money. | A huge portion of the activities were unavailable in general but you don‚Äôt find this out till after you purchase and try to make reservations.   Then overnight 1/4 of the remaining options disappeared.  Our premium activity was cancelled by the vendor 10 minutes prior to our reservation and they won‚Äôt reschedule or refund, of course on GoCity it shows up as utilized. | Bought this pass as it said I could choose from the San Diego Zoo or Adventure Park (not both). Fine with me as we were only planning to go to the zoo. Once paid for, neither was an option. What a rip off! | The app is easy to use and pretty simple | This has the option to add activities to an itinerary, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to view that itinerary after adding activities to it. I eventually figured out that if I add activities to my ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù instead, I was able to see a list of favorites.

The favorites button is a white button which is displayed on top of an image of the activity. Unfortunately one of the activities I wanted to add to my favorites had an image that was white too in the area where the favorite button was (white on white) so I had no idea whether I was successfully tapping the favorites button. I eventually figured out that I could tap where I thought the favorites button probably was and then go to my favorites list and check if the activity was listed in my favorites‚Ä¶nope, not there. So I tried again‚Ä¶That time it worked.

So after some trial and error I got this to work acceptably to be able to see a list of the activities I plan to do and tap on them to get directions to them. It would be helpful to have these things improved though. | We had a two day pass. We saved $147 each above what we paid for the pass. We used the app and just presented our passes on my phone and in we went. No problems. Probably got to do and see more because we didn‚Äôt worry about needing to spend all day at the aquarium to ‚Äúget our money‚Äôs worth‚Äù, for example. | Best bang for your buck when it comes to bundling deals AND saves you money in the end. The Inclusive pass is where it‚Äôs at. | These passes are great. Saves time having to order at every individual attraction & money‚Ä¶ one set price for all depending on the number of attractions. The difference between all inclusive & explorer is‚Ä¶ inclusive pass gives you 35 attractions for a set amount of days while explorer pass allows you to experience the number of attractions over several days/weeks. I chose explorer. üòç | Es mejor comprar por separado tus sitios de inter√©s, no es m√°s econ√≥mico comprarlo con esta aplicaci√≥n. Compre 10 atracciones y solo pude disfrutar de 6. Luego no hay forma de tener atenci√≥n al cliente, no hay quien resuelva tus inconvenientes. | Firstly I like the idea of this app. Rather than scrambling through bunch of different websites to get tickets. You just use this app.

Secondly, I was skeptical about it at first. We went to the edge in Hudson yards. I thought I would have to go back to the ticket counter & get tickets. But it went smoothly. As soon as we went in, the staff was happy to see the QR code and let us in without any questions. I have only used it once. I am actually looking forward to reuse this app. | I bought go-city passes for Barcelona, Paris, and Rome.  In Rome, NONE of the places listed as included (except Big Bus) took our tickets.  In Paris, we got the Museum Pass in addition to Big Buss, but nothing else worked.  We never got the chance to try them in Barcelona, but if you are thinking of traveling outside the US, AVOID THIS COMPANY! | Since you buy passes first, then reserve, you cannot get a pass for what you want to do because everything is already booked. | Processed three different orders and each was cancelled, effectively maxing out my card (at least for 1-2 billing cycles) without a deliverable. WTH. | Seems to difficult to figure it out! | Be aware that this pass is not all inclusive as they say. If you see tours from the same company in this pass, even though it says all inclusive they only let you do one of the tours, not multiple. | It‚Äôs a bit confusing on how to add the passes. | The effort to connect the pass to the reservations is unnecessarily complicated and not user friendly. It asks for the code for the passes when you follow the links to make the reservation. It doesn‚Äôt tell you you will need the code nor does it automatically provide the code. It should be pretty simple to make this on a secure link. | Very convenient | A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE! Trying to sync tickets purchased at Tickets At Work is taking over a hour. I purchased 2 different kinds of tickets and Go City doesn‚Äôt recognize all of the tickets. The rep otp was very pleasant and a little hard to understand. Horrible experience. | Frequency of Hop on Bus can be better | When I bought the pass it was supposed to include a lot of things. When I got to Paris none of the things that were supposed to be included were part of my pass. Almost everything said I had to pay more. I would not buy a pass again from this company since they changed what was included right as I got to the city and started going places. | We purchased the family a 3-day pass in Stockholm after having an extremely positive experience with the Copenhagen Card. Unfortunately this pass and the app are NOT as user-friendly as that one. We couldn‚Äôt get on any of the boat tours we wanted because you can‚Äôt sign up in advance without being at their kiosk which doesn‚Äôt help on a short trip. The hop on/off buses were very confusing as there are two different companies that run practically identical looking buses but this one only ran 3 to cover their whole city route on a busy holiday weekend. When asked about it, the customer service was very defensive (to the point of being borderline rude) with little to offer as a solution. They also dropped a few of the attractions between the time I initially looked at it and booked the passes. Given our experience I would have rather booked tickets directly with Stromma and paid for the various museums than deal with the hassle that has been navigating the pass/app. | The lines to use this pass are extremely long.   Hour + long wait‚Ä¶don‚Äôt purchase. | Great app & it‚Äôs super easy to use. Plenty of choices to pick from to see various sites within a city. Highly recommend. | I purchased 3 adult and 1 child pass, and the child pass did not appear in my passes - and it is very difficult to find out how to contact anyone to fix this. | You still have to make your way to an office for a Paper ticket to ride the bus.

I have asked them to call me numerous times and I‚Äôm about to lose money because of this company. 

Absolutely ridiculous | Premium options are way to expensive to even remotely consider it. The ads creeping in for travel insurance, eSIMs, etc. are also making this app les useful and easy to use. I do enjoy using this to keep track of my flights past, present, and future but I think it‚Äôs starting to miss the mark for me. | This is the only travel app that has difficulty synchronizing all of my flights. This is also the only one out of the four paid travel apps that continually displays ads. I have asked them to disable them, unless I explicitly consent. I promise to do that. They lied. | Best thing about app in the air is being able to look down on my phone and see a push alert locked on my phone telling me how much time is left on my flight ! | Been using the app for a couple years and bought the lifetime subscription so I‚Äôm stuck with it.
Good features are that that it imports from TripIt. It can split flights between your own and other people. It updated to include live activities feature. Now for the bad - some flights are inaccurate or delayed. The app itself is confusing and has too much unnecessary information such as ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù countdown, ‚Äúboarding‚Äù countdown. The checkin is not even accurate per airline as southwest allows checkin 10 mins before departure but appintheair chooses an arbitrary time. Also lots of advertising to book hotels and other nonsense. If I was starting again I may go for their other competitor flighty | It is all good with the app except the past flights information can‚Äôt be found in all 2023 (including the flight number, departure and arrival). Hope you can fix this. | Best app available for your trip is very Accurate. You can see if there‚Äôs a Delay, if there‚Äôs a delayed of your flight is very accurate the information. | I absolutely love this app and use it to log and track all of my flights, but some features just need a little bit of work. 

Generally a trip with a layover has a single Booking Ref Number and ticket number, so if there's a way to input that without doing it for every single flight, that would speed things up a lot | This app used to be AWESOME, always keeping up with the latest information. But the last few years it‚Äôs not giving accurate or up to date info. Wrong gates, wrong boarding times‚Ä¶ imagine the impact of that on your travel day. I PAY for this app. A subscription. And now I don‚Äôt trust it. So today I am cancelling and this is why. At first I thought it was an anomaly but today I‚Äôm realizing they never got themselves together & inaccurate info is the norm for this app. It‚Äôs too bad.

UPDATE TO RESPONSE: I sent you all of that months ago. I‚Äôm not spending any more time on it. | Been using the app for a few years now and I just love all the new features and improvements to it. 

I don‚Äôt even need to upload anything anymore, it‚Äôs smart enough to pull everything from my Airline Loyalty Apps

Keep up the good work and looking forward to more new features you have in the pipeline | I‚Äôm not sure why I have to watch ads for travel insurance and a summary of my last year‚Äôs travel. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to get that off the opening screen and I‚Äôm a paid user. 

When I‚Äôm traveling I don‚Äôt want to wade through this clutter on my screen | Incredibly useful while flying an traveling. The support team is AMAZING in helping with any issues there may be. Great job guys! | this used to be my favorite travel app- tracking the arriving plane, up to date info before the carriers apps updated but over the last week (right after purchasing a year subscription!) it was useless tracking the flight, the plane that wasn‚Äôt even there and while i was sitting at the airport waiting hours for my delayed plane the app showed me to be in mid flight! i also bought for the apple watch face which i thought was a great idea but it doesn‚Äôt sync at all. next step is to cancel subscription and try to get my $ back since it failed so massively the time i needed it most! | I‚Äôm a flight attendant and I LOVED this all simply for the interface I could put on my watch! Though it stopped working a few weeks ago! I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling and updating my software and it‚Äôs still not working. Please, for flight crew everywhere, fix this! | I‚Äôve used this app a lot and am actually glad I have it. It keeps me updated on changes or delays, etc. makes traveling a lot easier when you have the right info. | This app used to work spotless but now when it says that the plane landed ,it is still in the air approaching the airport. Lifetime subscription and whenever deleting the last manually added travel information it says it is synching , you need to quit the app so it stops synching. 1-Your 2023 review does not get deleted and stuck there forever and 2-Do you need help also is stuck on screen. 3-Also found out that it tries to get my other iCloud account email account (although now that it is blocked) . I think when I got this app was to follow planes and not to book hotels and other stuff. Over the years a simple working app is bloated by information we don‚Äôt need.
The Apple Watch app does not work !!! | –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ –æ–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ —á–∞—Å–∞—Ö –ø–æ—è–≤–∏–ª—Å—è –±–∞–≥ | If you fly american whom i only fly this app doesnt work. Love that i bought a lifetime sub. Now i need a new app and cant even transfer all my stuff over. 

Heres to starting over! | They decided to use a pill-shaped progress bar for tracking flights, and even worse it uses green as the progress indicator.

As a result it looks like a battery indicator and it actually hides your real battery indicator. 

This needs to be seriously reworked. | I‚Äôve loved and used this app for many years as you can see from my review below. However, I am unable to recommend this app until an ongoing bug gets resolved. You can not add people (subscribe) them to receive updates regarding your travel plans. This is a huge feature of the program and I‚Äôve been told it will be fixed  soon. It‚Äôs been at least 18 months. As a Lifetime user, I‚Äôm about ready to cut my losses and try another program if AITA can‚Äôt get this fixed soon. Very disappointing.

I‚Äôve been using AITA for years and was so impressed that I became a Lifetime paid user. I had a UI suggestion and within 12 hours, I was contacted and problem fixed. I have never had such great customer service from any company. I‚Äôm not a big power user, but I sure appreciate the service I was provided as an occasional flyer.

Very cool flex to show off all your trips if you are a frequent flyer. | I want to like this app but it doesn‚Äôt always find my flight number correctly so i just have to add manually. I‚Äôve tried sharing my information to social media and it comes up blank. Flighty seems to be better | I've been genuinely impressed with this app's overall efficiency and user-friendly interface, making it a go-to for my needs. However, I encountered a hiccup when trying to import my flights from the calendar a feature that just doesn't seem to work. Despite reaching out to the support team for assistance, I was disappointed by the lack of help provided. This issue aside, I still highly rate the app for its performance in other areas. | It‚Äôs a must app for all travelers, especially those using IOS, flawless integration between all devices.  Knows about gate changes before the airline employee.  And all for free?  Forget about it | Constant notifications with an insurance sales pitch: please add on option for disabling it, it is super frustrating. 

Also Air France-Flying Blue sync/login doesn‚Äôt work. App has been quite buggy lately. It used to be better in the past. | Good app to keep and track your travel plans and history. 
Excellent Customer Support. An issue with adding the flights to the calendar but corrected with a new update in a timely manner while communicating with the support staff. | Used to be a great APP but recently it‚Äôs getting weird! I‚Äôve been to Japan for more than 10 times, however in my record it shows only 5 visits (the routes on the map are correct though). It says I‚Äôve been to 69 countries in the record but only 64 countries for the stickers‚Ä¶ I chosen the English language, however every time when I tried to export my record as an image, it‚Äôs in different language‚Ä¶ please fix the above issues please, thank you so much. | Tried booking a flight from Chicago to Harrisburg, and the prices I was seeing in app were always 5-10% more than the ones I saw in google flights. Maybe they are pocketing the difference or their data is wrong. Either way, it does not give me confidence to book with them. Also choosing which class I want is not straightforward, with the info not matching the airline website, so it‚Äôs not clear what upgrades I‚Äôm paying for (like is seat selection included? Is ‚Äúpremium‚Äù seat selection included? Etc). | The app idea is great. But the options don‚Äôt work as well. You can‚Äôt link a reward account. It doesn‚Äôt accept any of the codes you‚Äôre given. And a lot of features were available without subscription and now all you can do is see you flight info which you get through any other app anyways. A bit disappointed. | There‚Äôs a few things I really like about app in the air - consistency of information makes traveling a lot easier, a single place with my travel history - and it‚Äôs pretty easy to use.

Once they started making subscriptions a priority - the app‚Äôs now riddled with useless info, for subs and free users alike. Maybe worth it if you travel a lot and are looking for company üëÄ | I‚Äôve been using this app for several years now. Their support team is great and has helped me resolve issues I‚Äôve had. Recently however the app has continued to make more and more features premium only, even though they used to be free. It‚Äôs a shame to the app become less useful with these changes. | I can‚Äôt enter my data for United and it won‚Äôt tell me why not.   I paid for this? | Been using the free version since 2019 and worked well in the beginning.  Once you have used it for awhile and start logging a lot of trips the program gets buggy.  Definitely wouldn‚Äôt buy the program now since the basic free program doesn‚Äôt work. | This app tracks you across other apps and websites using your identifier, asks for your passwords to sensitive websites, and sells all your info to the highest bidder. Or at minimum are storing it ready to sell, as per their privacy policy, to anyone who buys them out. 

For an app that costs so much, it disgusting how much data collection they have. 

Go with Flighty! Less data collection and a much more polished app. | I like the basics of the app. But there are glitches when adding anything to the wallet. | I watching on Flightradar24 the flight JSA232 (6-Oct-2023) circling near to the airport. Yet app in the air announces that the flight has landed. It is not the first time such glitch happened. Quite often the app informs that a flight has departed, yet you can see the airplane is sitting next to a gate | Been forwarding email to just@add.flights many times in the past few days to add my flight to the account. The function doesn‚Äôt work! Reached out to support who promised an agent will reach out to me in 12 hours but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone reaching out.

Overall, this app feels like a beta. Flighty maybe more expensive but it does the job well in terms off flight management.

Cons:
- it doesn‚Äôt  tell you when your gate changes 
- weird language display: when you flight in enroute, it will tell you your flight is landing in approximately how many hours instead
- flight itinerary forwarding via email doesn‚Äôt work ( I tested with Southwest Airlines)
-  Auto check-in mostly doesn‚Äôt work. Mostly because when I set auto check in to my flight it doesn‚Äôt do anything instead it keeps notifying me about check-in. There‚Äôs no way to mark if I‚Äôve checked in for a flight.

Keep raising your price without making your app better is definitely a straight ticket to heaven. | Love it | Not working after update | While the latest update may have fixed 30+ bugs, it also caused a new one. When trying to view an existing trip, the app crashes. | Used to be a great app, now it‚Äôs extremely bloated with half of the stuff not working properly and the other half just being too cumbersome to use. 

On top of that the app has changed its focus to try and get you to book things through the app (probably for commissions), constantly nagging you to book a hotel or this and that with no way to disable it. 

Such a shame. 

Nowadays I‚Äôd recommend Flighty over App in the Air in a heartbeat, Flighty is more focused and streamlined if you fly regularly and aren‚Äôt in need of all the noise about hotels, rental cars, sight seeing, passport, boarding pass, etc. etc. | Very usefull. | I‚Äôve been using this app for a few years now, and it is by far the most useful flight tracking app I have ever used, and I use pretty much all the big ones that are out there. The tech-support is also incredibly responsive and address issues within a day. I‚Äôd highly recommend this app to any frequent business travelers out there, along with a lifetime subscription that is well worth it for the additional features it provides. | I am frequently flyer for my business. I gave this app a try for my last few flights. It was consistently wrong in its timings for boarding, flight tracking, and landing. Even when I reported delays directly in the app, it would show the flight as boarding about to end when we hadn‚Äôt even started yet due to the delay. Shows the flight landing when we‚Äôre still in the air. Come on this is basic stuff that you can pull from any number of sources. 

The UI is clunky, cluttered, and confusing. There‚Äôs too much going on. They need to focus on getting the basics straight and not trying to do everything all at once. | I‚Äôve been using App in The Air for many years and it has been a trusty travel companion. Unfortunately, over the past couple years, the developers have pivoted their business to flight and hotel bookings.

Each time I open the app I am accosted by up-sells and customer-hostile designs to lure me into booking another flight or hotel. But, that‚Äôs not why I originally fell in love with this app ‚Äî it was because it helped me track and plan flights! The developers seem to have lost sight of this, and have all but abandoned making any improvements or design refreshes to the original flight tracking and planning features. It seems, somehow, that those core features have actually gotten worse (and harder to access). In fact, compared to some of the competing flight tracking apps, App in The Air now feels clunky, corporate, and out-of-touch.

PREVIOUS REVIEW (5 stars):
Love having flight paths and information along with boarding times on my watch and my phone. Slightly inconvenient that there's no pull to refresh feature on the iPhone - which means I have to force quit the app and open it again to see changes after adding flights. | I‚Äôve not been traveling enough lately to justify the paid version yet, but it‚Äôs been great to keep documents in one place. I like the maps and stickers and trip data aspect of it. I‚Äôd like to see it take the profile stuff a little further and add a trip log for writing about the trip, and have the option to keep it private or post it to share with other travelers. Over all, it‚Äôs pretty much unrivaled in what all it can do.

Update: I have the pro version now and it‚Äôs pretty comprehensive. Being able to add documents to all the trips and append hotel and car rental information in addition to notes on each trip pretty much hits everything I need. Looking forward to playing around more with it. | Easy and convenient app to make traveling a little more stressful. Good app | In the last year or so, this app has gone from decent to horrible. Their flight database is not regularly updated. When scanning boarding passes or manually entering flight detail, the information added is incorrect. I personally I am on multiple flights each week and the information they have in their database on major carrier‚Äôs flight numbers and routes is incorrect. having provided them with multiple examples of this, the response received is always ‚ÄúThe carrier it failed to update our database for us.‚Äú honestly, what major air carrier, or any carrier for that matter, is going to update a third-party apps database on flight detail? | It‚Äôs a generally well-ish designed app, especially for the user interface, however, there are still many kinks to be smoothed out. It frequently and senselessly groups my random hotels and flights together with no way to splitting them up. For example, why would a hotel in Japan for august be in the same trip as a flight from Chicago to San Francisco in a different month? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Another big issue is that, it reads flights booked but not cancelled, that‚Äôs still fine but often it can‚Äôt even add flights with a clear confirmation from the same airline. Same airline, same email format, but some flights get recorded and some not. I just don‚Äôt get it. 
So yeah, decent app, but much improvement needed.

Support is fine until there‚Äôs a problem they can‚Äôt solve. 

In my case they just disappeared for DAYS and you only get an apology email days later for the long delay. 

It saves time, and is safer, to use a traditional eSIM. I almost did, but my ride app was working fine with airport WiFi.

But imagine being in a taxi in a foreign country where you don‚Äôt know the language and can‚Äôt see where the driver is taking you. 

I‚Äôd contacted support one or two days before my flight to avoid issues like this, explaining that I‚Äôll be in a new country and asking how to ensure the installation goes smoothly.

I also reached out from both the departure airport and the arrival airport. Still, I was left with no connection because the app wasn‚Äôt working properly.

I could send and receive support messages on the app but nothing else worked, it kept freezing up. 

I tried 4 different apps, including the ride app, and all worked perfectly, except Nomad. 

If this issue is resolved it would be a great service. Hopefully tech can figure it out. | We used Nomad eSIM‚Äôs a few times and overall we would recommend their products.
Used it in China on an iPad Mini and it worked like a charme. Installation was easy, great connection and good data speeds.
Recently we used a Nomad provided eSIM in Argentina and it has been rather disappointing. They use Movistar and Personal for cellular service and their connections as well as the speeds have been rather disappointing.
Our regular US cell service with T-Mobile connected to Claro - no compari! So much better availability, much faster and reliable connections.
The China experience was a 5 star, Argentina a 3 star at best. We will still use Nomad in future but they should definitely look for other/better carriers in Argentina. | Instalacion sencilla y relativamente r√°pida | Website works great on mobile son it‚Äôs fine, but I really wish I could stay logged into the app on two devices at once.

I'm visiting Argentina, downloaded and paid for the plan (iPhone 15 iOS 17) . The *paying for it* is the ONLY part that worked. I have spent three hours of my life trying to use what I bought from Nomad -- but have failed with every restart, reboot, each dive back into iPhone Cellular settings to change settings per conflicting directions on Nomad site and app. Included in Nomad‚Äôs fails are useless instructions, conflicting pop up screens, and ... buried at the end one of of the two ‚ÄúCongratulations on purchasing‚Äù emails from Nomad ... notice that the eSim was actually provided by ""eSim Go"".

Conflicting instructions on how to activate, tech support only available after a business day, FAQ article useless. The New York Times should retract their endorsement. Epic fail.

Update 2/6/2024:

Dear Nomad, 

Kindly do not accuse me of making things up in your online reply. Here are subject lines of the TWO emails I received from Nomad after I paid:

1. Welcome to Nomad! Travel like a local with eSIM!
2. Here is how you access your Nomad plan!

Sadly, neither email was helpful in actually making the plan functional. Eventually, a colleague who‚Äôs an IT prefessional and an iPhone iOS expert got me going ‚Ä¶ only after the three hours lost mentioned in my initial review.

(Note that juggling the email screen, and the Nomad screen, the many Nomad popups, and the multiple Settings screens within my iPhone made the nightmare even worse). | The eSIM I bought is very fast and easy to use
Will buy it next time | I did extensive research on many eSIM choices for my travel from the US to Portugal and Malta. I decided to give nomad a shot and am very pleased. I had a tech question and submitted it via the app and they were very responsive and also followed up on my satisfaction. I was out of the US for 15 days and decided to choose the 10 MB package, which was much cheaper than other eSIM providers. On day 13, I have only used 3 MB and I have been on maps the entire time while walking. The service is great with no dead spots. 
I‚Äôd be happy to recommend nomad to all. | I want to use the app but the after sending the code to my email, the keyboard will not appear to type it in. I have done everything to try and force the keyboard open but it won‚Äôt pop up. Waste of time. | Well, I don‚Äôt expect too much from these companies but when I finally needed customer service, they failed miserably. 
A√≠ralo is also pretty bad but I recommend their eSIM app over this one. 
And finally, I recommend a phone with a SIM card slot ‚Ä¶ the new iPhones for the US market don‚Äôt  have them anymore. It‚Äôs the only reason I need buy eSIM in the first place | First time trying it out, I like it so far and will keep using if all continues smoothly. Even got $3 off with a promo code. | The unlimited plan caps you at 2gb a day, but it‚Äôs incredibly hard to find this fine print before you purchase a plan. (Like literally impossible, they have no reference to data capping on their terrible website). Their app is unintuitive, their data plans are OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced (Lyca mobile is less than half the price for more data in the UK) and in general I‚Äôve had such an unpleasant experience. Not sure who they paid for their good reviews but I‚Äôm really upset | Make sure you use a temp email to sign up for this service. They claim they only send *one* marketing email per month but it‚Äôs one per day. Unsubscribe and they will send you another marketing email the very next day and the day after and so on. | love using nomad, extremely easy to navigate and makes traveling headache-free. ran into some issues and customer service reps were able to get it resolved within 24 hours. will continue to use nomad for my international travels üòä | Great customer service, I had an issue with an eSim purchased for Brazil and they were quick to resolve the issue and issue a refund. I‚Äôve used them traveling abroad in Switzerland, Italy, and England and had a great experience. Only advice is to pay attention to what countries are offered on the eSim (Switzerland likes to be special and require their own) but Nomad is very up front in which Sims work where | I was traveling in Europe and got an eSIM from Nomad.   It worked great until I used up my bucket of data.   When I was hit my original usage limit and rolled over to the new bucket, it said it was used immediately.   I contacted their support department and was told they were looking into it.  Every day for a week, they sent me a message that said they were still looking into it, then they stopped updating me.  I returned home, so I don‚Äôt need it anymore, but I never got any kind of resolution. | I used Nomad to purchase data plans for a trip to China and Hong Kong with mixed experiences. I installed the China esim before my trip and activation was seamless on arrival. My experience with the HK esim was not as positive. Checkout in the app repeatedly returned a generic error message. I was only able to complete the transaction by removing the promo code‚Äîfrustrating because the deal was being promoted in the Nomad app. Once I completed the purchase and activated the esim, I was unable to get connectivity. The troubleshooting steps in the app were not helpful. I contacted support for both issues and they were responsive but unfortunately due to time zones differences I lost a full day‚Äôs use of the plan I paid for because Nomad‚Äôs default network configuration was incorrect. The idea of seamless access to international data plans is great, but be prepared to be anchored to wifi to troubleshoot on arrival abroad. | Awesome travel app for Europe and US. Saved me lots of money and fast connections. | Bought a 45 day plan and so far only getting 4G in Seoul. Literally one of the best markets to have 5G üî• but I‚Äôm poking around like a peasant. iPhone 15 Pro. 3 stars for being average. | I was hesitant to try Nomad on a three week trip given some negative reviews but it worked seamlessly for using different cell providers in 6 countries or regions :  Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan.  At every stop the service worked without a hitch, never needed to reboot or wonder what went wrong. | Stopped working in US and support does not answer | I travel the world a lot and often and this app is one of the best things for me. To be able to easily have date anywhere is fantastic. 
Easy to use and get access to the esims | It works ok but I don‚Äôt receive phone calls for my us phone number or text messages. Add on feature failed and I was left without data. Data randomly stopped working one time and I had to rely on my primary carrier for data to navigate a foreign cut in the pouring rain at night. Use with caution and have back up plans. Not recommended if you use us phone number as you won‚Äôt be able to call or text with foreign data enabled. | Easy to install fast connection,good signal even in crowded areas, glad to use Nomad
( thanks for sale packages ) ü•∞ | All worked smoothly, easy app installation, easy activation, 10 gb for only $12 USA. What more can you ask. I even got 5G speed in cities. | I‚Äôve purchased a APAC 20GB for 45 days . The data shows 5 G but only can run 5Mpbs. you can barely do anything with this internet. | I used in Switzerland and worked really good! | In the midst of a genocide, thousands bought e-sims for people who don‚Äôt have access to telecommunications and internet. Nomad made changes to ensure that these people couldn‚Äôt use their e-sims. Absolutely not reliable and grossly dehumanizing. | Don‚Äôt bother wasting your time with this. The internet speed was so slow it wasn‚Äôt even connected‚Ä¶ literally. It acted fast for the first 30 minutes and then got so slow it couldn‚Äôt even load the plan in the app. I deserve my money back and so does anybody that ever bought this crap | Would rather have paid more for actual 5g speeds from a legit provider | Upon arriving in Barcelona, Spain I started my Nomad connection. No hiccups, just plain access to my text, WhatsApp‚Ä¶ etc.
One little problem created by a conflict between my expired purchase and the new SIM, I contacted the help support and‚Ä¶ the team could not be more professional, dedicated, knowledgeable.
The communication was excellent and prompt.
I recommend NOMAD with the certainty that it will make your life easier. | Used in Australia and New Zealand. For the most part it works fairly well. The app is quite good compared to others and using Apple Pay is nice. The downside is that you will get a Hong Kong IP address, which can be a bit sluggish and cause issues with apps and websites that block Hong Kong. For Example, Citi Bank and TikTok will refuse to work. Even on local WiFi, TikTok will not work unless you turn the eSIM off in your phone settings. | Thanks guys!!
Easy to buy 
Easy to install
And it works!!! | Bought a 45-day plan for Asia 16 countries. Worked well 7 days in Seoul Korea, plus 2 days in Shanghai China. Stoped working after no matter how try. | Muy buena app para viajar, buenos precios, f√°cil para recargar los planes. Abarcan muchos pa√≠ses. | I purchased wrong data plan by mistake. And I contacted customer service in help center. They responded quickly and help me to canceled wrong one. And also teach me to purchased correct one. | My husband and I travel full time worldwide and using the Esim has been a huge money saver. Installation process is easy, even for this retired ladyüòâ When I have run into any issues their support team is quick to respond and walk me through the process. Currently in Japan and Rachel was quick to help me solve an oversight on my part in the simple installation process. Use my referral code if you want to save on your first use TEAC55AJ | You download the app and start using your phone with the number that was given to you. It is that easy. Compared to another app I bought, NOMAD is much friendlier. Highly recommend this without any hesitation. I used this for my Italy trip and had no problem at all. So what are you waiting for? Go get this. Morie A. | The team at Nomad provides excellent customer service. There are times when these type of apps need adjustments or I make mistakes with Settings and they always are willing to help and they're very quick to respond. This is not been my experience with other data apps I highly recommend Nomad. | So grateful to have found this - easy and inexpensive e sim that allows us to stay connected (and not get lost!) when we travel. Have shared with friends and family - | the app and their esim are a complete disaster, travelling around Europe, it eventually worked less than 25% of the time, the rest I payed roaming with my local company, I didn‚Äôt have any option, their customer service is just a Q&A and they definitely have nothing they can do as their product is so poor and completely incompetent. it's literally a waste of your money. It worked in London it didn‚Äôt in Cambridge. It worked in Paris, it didn‚Äôt in Amsterdam, Berlin and the rest. It was so disappointed | Had hopes to use this but after setting up my account, selecting a plan, and going to checkout was notified that my device was not compatible because only unlocked devices are able to use esims. Would have been nice to know before I wasted so much time. | the app WAS great for months until it magically all started sucking up my data and they did not give me full refunds for my issues. i would use my phone completely as normal and not do anything differently and then magically all my data would be used up in a matter of an hour. they said it was snapchat causing it but that‚Äôs a bit confusing since i used the esims for months before encountering this issue (with out changing anything about how i use my phone)s i then switched to another esim provider and have had no issue, so it 100% was an issue w the nomad esims specifically. just be careful with spending your money as they are very stingy with refunds. i only got a few vouchers and a redemption code that didn‚Äôt even work. | My esim card didn't work and they have me asking repetitively for a refund. | A couple times it didn‚Äôt connect with cell towers but for the most part it worked when I was in Italy and Portugal.

So I reached out to world packers and told them I wanted a refund and apparently I don‚Äôt qualify for a refund even though the app doesn‚Äôt even work. | It‚Äôs a volunteer opportunity‚Ä¶ I get having to pay a small fee to maintain the app but ‚Ç¨50 per year?? Insane profit-seeking price, and especially since the app doesn‚Äôt even work that well. | Why cant I send a message to people that have volunteered at some place and left a review? | This app is very easy to use and helps the aspiring world traveler to feel comfortable with applying for jobs and new experiences in new places :) | I‚Äôve heard so many great things about Worldpackers and I‚Äôve been trying to apply but their app has been glitching and I‚Äôve been fighting with it for an hour trying to be able to sign up and it just won‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed because this is something that I wanted to do for a while. | I love everything about the app and opportunities it brings and the plans are so worth it. The only issue/bug I wish they‚Äôd fix in the app is I have favorited hosts that closed their position and I have no way to unfavorite it and it just takes up room. | If it was life time payment would be better like cough-surfing but still looks interesting to me like a traveler!

They do an incredible job of connecting willing and eager travelers with certified organizations and hostels to provide housing and other amenities in exchange for some form of agreed upon work. It is a great way to travel if you‚Äôre not afraid of doing things on the cheaper side along with being in a constant state of meeting and interacting with new and interesting people! | I love to backpack and this app helped me make a bunch of dreams come true and is continuing to do so, if you are a traveler this can be one of the best apps you can ever download | This app is everything that I was looking for and more, my dreams are becoming true thanks to this app. | Something is wrong with this app, it‚Äôs not working, anything I try to do it gives me a ops error message. | The app is very easy to use.

Something went wrong :( Please try again later. | Um aplicativo completo cheio de conte√∫dos e com total seguran√ßa | The app itself is fine but I cannot get notifications to quit, despite them being turned off inside the app as well as in phone settings. And not just actual notifications but also push-ad type stuff for memberships. It‚Äôs frustrating but hopefully just a bug that can get corrected in an update. | I have been volunteering almost an year with you.It is been fantastic and helpful.

I would just be recommending to add one more answer to public comment,from the volunteers,not just one :) 
(I‚Äôve got a untruthful comment from 
A stressed host and could not replay in order to don‚Äôt affect my profile ..) | Worldpackers is unlike any other travel app on the market. The promise is engaging and straightforward‚Äî lend your talents and skills in exchange for an experience in a new community. 

For $49 you get full access to certification courses that can help you learn more about the roles and opportunities you can request in and bolster your profile for maximum engagement with your future host. The user interface is responsive and easy to navigate for first time guests and those with low computer literacy. 

The chat feature is effective and allows you to directly engage with the host of your choice in a safe and secure way. There are many ways you can stand out and showcase your skills and talents, which helps you better align with meaningful opportunities. 

If you are a creative, conscientious and curious traveler I highly recommend this app. | So I‚Äôm planning an upcoming trip to Latin America. Very excited to try out Worldpackers for the first time and psyched by all the things I‚Äôve read about it.

The review is purely for the app itself. When I go to the Academy section, nothing I click on works, even the Continue Watching intro series on ‚ÄúHow to be an outstanding worldpacker‚Äù. I basically have to go to the mobile site to watch.

Everything else works fine but when a whole tab malfunctions it‚Äôs kind of a bummer. I downloaded it yesterday too so I know I have the latest version. | Muito bom | WorldPackers really changed my life. I had the best experiences through them. There‚Äôs a lot of amazing hosts and thanks to the reviews, I know what I‚Äôm getting myself into. I haven‚Äôt had a bad experience and will continue to keep using the service. The App is just great to have instead of constantly logging back in through the browser and it‚Äôs easy to navigate. | The app itself holds all the information but it‚Äôs not very device friendly on my opinion.  It‚Äôs hard to narrow down opinions and then has gotten buggy as well, but other that that it‚Äôs good for the little that it offers and keeping in touch with the other members.

Not good for searching opportunities at all in my opinion | I was really excited to find this program, and so I went ahead and paid the membership fee. After using it for a few hours I noticed a few issues that could be fixed for UI. For example, when you open a position and you read under activities, it gets cut off in the bottom. I also noticed when I was inputting my background info the text would run off to the side and get cut off as well. I may consider just using the website instead but so far it‚Äôs been fine. | Worldpackers collects $50 from travelers by selling a false expectation that people can get free stays in exchange of volunteer ‚Äúwork‚Äù which they pitch in a way that doesn‚Äôt sound like work. We were a host on the platform and the first 5 travelers who came really had no interest whatsoever in working at all. The first traveler wanted to tour the island the second day of work, the second traveler never showed up, the third one ended up upgrading to a paid room once they understood there was volunteer work involved otherwise and the fourth went on vacation after two days of volunteering. Don‚Äôt waste your $50 for the false hope they sell you. If you‚Äôre truly interested in volunteer work, all the NGOs including our our NGO have websites that advertise for volunteer positions. You can Google and you will find them at no cost to you. | I went to browse, it‚Äôs been a over a year since I logged in, and my entire app is blank. I‚Äôm getting a user error | App is easy to navigate | Very useful and easy to play with | I downloaded the app for the first time today. Unfortunately I was not able to signup with Facebook. When I tried to use email signup, I got stuck at giving my birth date. The datePicker somehow shows blank and I was not able to pick my birth date on the picker so I couldn‚Äôt complete the signup process. What‚Äôs good about this app if user can‚Äôt signup and use it? :( | Scam duh | I‚Äôm tired of traveling app like this that tout Verification by payment of a subscription or fees. That‚Äôs only verifying I‚Äôm paying for membership services not because I or anyone else is a safe trustworthy person! Where are the requirements for background checks? Personal references? Of both parties. 
Also, if I can only find one or two opportunities (with no guarantees I‚Äôll get either host spot) and have no plans on making this a yearly lifestyle why should I pay $50 for it?!!! Ridiculous!
App doesn‚Äôt state membership required to apply for position! | Hello, i like your apps idea and what it entails. I would very much be interested in seeking a collaboration as a consultant of NGOs! | N√£o tenho palavras para agradecer a esse aplicativo, estou simplesmente realizando meus sonhos. | Very beneficial to travelers! | I found a few cool sounding opportunities but read the reviews and found 1 star reviews that detailed being manipulated or abused by their host. I‚Äôm confused why those listings are still allowed to be up and now suspicious of the safety of any of the ones on the app since it seems like there is a carelessness towards potential travelers by not removing unsafe situations or screening hosts.

edit: now with the latest updates the app won‚Äôt even load | So, I recently found out that you can become and expert workdpacker and they had programs you could sign up for etc. So I'm logged in and go to check out the programs and it tells me to ""log in to apply""

I already am logged in? Anyways, I click the button to log in and it takes me to the log in screen so I login through facebook and it takes me back to the home screen. So I go to click on my profile page where it has the ""Become and expert"" button and it logs me out of my account. So naturally I log back in and it's just a never ending cycle. It says I'm logged in but when I go to check out the expert programs it says I'm not when I AM. It even logs me out when I go to click on my profile. I would like to become and expert but the app keeps saying I'm not logged in and I haven't logged in when I am c l e a r l y on my account. Fix it, please, it's very frustrating. | It is not letting me upload my profile phone. | Best app ever! Ux is great, there are lots of opportunities in all over the world... i will definitely recommend to my NGO | Amazing App. Shared Economy. Impact. The Best Social Travel Network. Congratulations. | App muito bom. | What about paid if they going to let you work really hard you should get paid as well | It does make you pay 50$ but that‚Äôs nothing in exchange for what it offers you! I bought the full version and now I‚Äôm doing what I love full time ! | This app requires a $50 yearly membership, which I find ridiculous.  HelpX.net does the same job and gives the option of donating $30 for a two-year membership‚Äî a membership for which I was more than happy to pay m when I saw how helpful the site is. | App seems to go smoothly until you try connecting with a host and the app wanta $50 per year for a verification app. Total spoof | The concept of the app is great but it's so limited. I wish I could make my own profile and list all the skills I can offer besides just the languages that I know. The notifications get annoying when people comment the same topic as I did and there's no way to turn them off unless I uninstall the app. | Muito ruim | I like the app, but even after the update, the search feature is still so limited. 

I would love to be able to search keywords so that I can find, for example, work on a vineyard in Argentina as opposed to looking through all 500 Argentina jobs, sifting through housekeeping and front desk work at hostels.

This app makes it simple and puts all the required knowledge in one place. Without giving up any critical personal data, this app can still deliver personal recommendations, boiling down the complex rules to only the most useful stuff you need to know, right now. It‚Äôs Great, very happy this app exists. | Since downloading this app, I have saved so much time. This app gave me the ability to
know quickly the next best card for me, and ever better lets me know when it‚Äôs time to apply again. I recommend this to anyone looking to level up their traveling. | Thx Zac for your kicka$$ app!  Its so easy keeping track of all of the cards and benefits. Keep up the great work, fellow traveler! | Great app for keeping track of credit cards and points. | I love that I don‚Äôt have to give account numbers but it tracks my cards. Alerts me to when fees will be due if I want to close an account. Suggests the best next card for me | I am new to the points and miles game and need all the help I can get! I didn‚Äôt realize when I signed up for this app how much individualized help I was going to get. I assumed the app was strictly for helping me stay organized which it does! But there‚Äôs also access to a mentor who I am able to ask individual questions to as needed. This is priceless! | This is hands down the best app for tracking cards, annual fees, and rewards. And the card genie feature takes all the guesswork out of the churning game. So glad I found this app. | Zac has personally answered any and all of my questions, super helpful kind! | The Travel Freely app has been great to keep track of my multiple credit cards. Whether you have just 1 credit card or 40, this app will make keeping track of your credit cards a breeze. | Love the app. Very concise & easy to use. Info is easy to see. Lots of info | My favorite feature on this free app is that it organizes your credit cards and sends you an email when you are close to the annual fee time, and it tells your how many cards in the last 24 months you‚Äôve opened (so you don‚Äôt go over the 5/24 Chase rule). Soooo helpful!! | I can‚Äôt thank you enough for developing this app! The organization, the features, ease and use of using the app, and the information is what makes this app so amazing! I frequently refer to this app to make informed decisions of what to do next. Thank you again! | Love this app and everything it does! The only request I have is to be able to add multiple businesses under each person. | Thanks to Zac and travel freely for all of the guidance. Zac is always quick to respond and provide advice. | This app is AWESOME, but sometimes it just won‚Äôt open. Even uninstalling and reinstalling doesn‚Äôt work. | And never able to open it. Even after killing the all and reboot the phone | App is not reliable. Cannot go through the checklist without having to sign in again and again. App is wonky and basically unusable.

Update:
Zac and his team have super responsive to my complaint. They have replicated the issue and have kept me apprised of their progress. I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed with them. Zac even sent me a gift card because my review helped them I.D. the issue. I‚Äôm able to use the website to input my info right now but I‚Äôm confident they will get the app corrected soon. This is the right way to do customer service and I heartily recommend Zac, his team, this app and the Travel Freely site. It‚Äôs a great way to track your cards and the key dates you need to get the most from your cards. Thanks Zac! | This is so useful to track credit cards as well as provide information about timing of getting cards and best travel crafts to get. Have also found the articles to be helpful. Thanks for making this a free app. I definitely find it useful!
-Katrina | The app is a godsend when it comes to keeping track of multiple users with multiple cards. Keeping track of dates (annual fee due, bonus due date) is something spreadsheets can‚Äôt do as well. Highly recommend it for people in the credit card game, both beginners and experts. | I love this app.  I can keep track of points earned, my chase 5/24 status and when cards will drop off my 5/24, and even discover cards I may be interested in next.

Highly recommend, especially if you are new to this! | When I first learned about using points and miles for traveling, I was completely overwhelmed. There are so many cards that offer so many different promotions and it‚Äôs really hard to keep everything straight. Especially if you are a two or more person household. This app makes tracking my progress and what cards I have and what cards I should consider easy. I would be lost without this app!! | I‚Äôm still in the process of learning all about traveling on points and this app is awesome at tracking all of your cards, when your next annual fee is due, what cards both you and P2 have and other suggest cards.

This app organized everything and it was right on my phone.

The app also give you insight into special offers you might otherwise not be aware of. They also dont ask for personal information. | This is a great app. Keeps all my info organized and makes it easy to see what fees are coming up.

THEY CHARGE YOU TO UNLOCK EACH CITY | Good | Great tool to plan your subway trips in Madrid or any other city | Not user friendly or simple whatsoever | This app is amazing!  I highly recommend this to anyone.  You can add a trip and then it will highlight the route! | The numbering on the yellow line (Arishiyama line) is off and caused me to get off one stop early and miss a transfer. A6 is NOT Randen Tengingawa!! That station is A5. Obviously some of the other numbers are off. | This was super helpful on our trip to Tokyo. Easy to plot our rout and get exactly where we wanted to go. Only thing that would make it better would be to add the platform numbers to the transfer stations. Hardest part on transfer is to know which platform to be on. Other than that, great app! | Costs $2.99 for one map. No free maps at all unlike previous reviewers say. | Great app but needs to be updated more often‚Ä¶ it is missing lines in cities where it makes it inconvenient to rely on the app. Basically, if your city is updated or hasn‚Äôt added any lines, this app is great for you. | Hi!

 These are not all the changes that I have named. There are a lot of changes. | Similar to the Tokyo map,  Osaka & Kyoto should be combined and also expanded to include it‚Äôs surrounding metro areas of Kobe and Nara Prefecture (Kintetsu Line).  The Osaka & Kyoto maps by themselves is incomplete thus inconvenient.  The Tokyo map on the other hand is perfect, including Yokohama, Kawasaki, Saitama etc‚Ä¶ the entire metro area. | San Francisco is listed as included, but the app can‚Äôt find or open it. And apparently you have to pay to map more than one city. | Great aesthetics on the map but not the most update one!

Can help update the newest extensions on Hong Kong subway system map? | The Worcester line of the Commuter Rail is missing the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Boston Landing station, which was opened on May 22, 2017.  So, basically I just wasted my money on this app because it cannot be trusted. | I love putting the markers for bars and restaurants and things to do and save them so it‚Äôs easy to see where everything is in relation to where I am. Love it! | A LOT of free city maps that were available have been swallowed up into this app, which charges you at least $3.00 to open any of them. Eff you, no way. | Keeps wanting you to pay for orldwide upgrade, just need seattle | Every time I try to use this app it forces me to upgrade, which I do, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the prompt again. I‚Äôve tried several times. | I have now used this in Tokyo, Seoul, NYC and Hong Kong.   No other maps needed.  And well worth buying the entire world.  This is now my go to travel map... | Paid to download map for use offline and got nothing. | Worthless is all I can say | Really loved being able to use this app to look at maps and especially plan routes on my trip while my phone had no regular cell service! I wish I had known in advance that only one map could be unlocked for free. | Tokyo subway system is really complicated with subway, light rails and hundreds of commuter rails like blood vessels. | You can‚Äôt use this app for free... | The map is too expensive, not worth the money at all, considering you can always use the google map and other free apps.ÊÉ≥Èí±ÊÉ≥ÁñØ‰∫ÜÂêß„ÄÇ | This application does not show subway exits on their map, nor is it responsive in selecting a station for review. I had to keep poking around for quite a while to get any reaction.
Frankly, this software is a rip-off - I can not recommend it. | There are inappropriate ads that appear along the top banner. How can this app be approved for ages 4+? I was about to recommend that my teen download this app for an upcoming trip but since you‚Äôre not paying attention to the content of the ads I won‚Äôt be recommending it to anyone. | They only give one map free which is fine. However they don‚Äôt warn you about it first. So I unlocked one map (Hiroshima) without knowing it‚Äôs my only free one. But I‚Äôd much rather have Tokyo which I am visiting first before deciding to buy any others.

Unfortunately there‚Äôs no way to undo my selection and there‚Äôs no upfront warning that you only get one free selection, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving this a low rating. | Otherwise you have to pay.  That isn‚Äôt any better than downloading individual metro maps for free. | Baixei o mapa do metr√¥ do Rio de Janeiro, cidade que moro, para verificar se o app era bom. Pedi uma rota da barra da Tijuca at√© Cantagalo (Copacabana), que fa√ßo sempre e da 15 min de metr√¥. Mas o app simplesmente deu uma rota bizarra indo para Madureira, depois central do Brasil para depois chegar a Copacabana, totalizando 3:55h de viagem, e de √¥nibus!! Fala s√©rio! Imagina se eu estou numa cidade que n√£o conhe√ßo? S√≥ vai me meter em furada essa porcaria. Desinstalando em 3, 2, 1... | We are going take an urban | Streamlined and simple to use
Well done | What I despise is the way this app was ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù via a free ‚ÄúTokyo Rail‚Äù app which didn‚Äôt do anything but consumed data and redirect to this new for-pay app.

Better be honest upfront. | Wanted me to walk half mile instead of taking train right out in front of me | Not very user friendly, had to use to apps to get where I was going. Gonna keep trying again, until make final assessment. | Would consider buying if it had bus maps too. Also, it is unclear whether maps are kept updated in line with changes in official maps. | Only gives you one route and tends to be a longer one. Would be much better if it gave you the best route or options. | Fails on numerous accounts,

Doesn‚Äôt have my home town, Dallas metro (DART), a metro area with numerous lines and airport access.

Near totally useless for the country with  the most cities with subways...  China.   

Google maps and Apple Maps have this info for, wait for it, free.

Why or who would use this app? | Confusing and does not accurately represent your location or directions in Milan. | Until yesterday this app was great. It now has intrusive ads on the screen even if you already ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù (i.e. ‚Äúpaid in some way for‚Äù) that city. One star. | Apple and Google Maps do a much better job with transit, are easier to use and are free. 

With City Rail Map:
There is no attempt to show the next train as there are no schedules.
There are no addresses for train stations, though there is a small map which does not indicate your location. 
There is no way to purchase tickets. 
It costs $4.99 to unlock one city. The above are free. 

I do not understand the rating this app gets. Apple and Google Maps are free, apps from the transit companies are free and far more functional (schedules, ticketing). | And then still wouldn‚Äôt work. | This app used to have important maps for free. Now they‚Äôre charging you for every map you need/want except one. I‚Äôm a traveler around Japan and the world and find it very useful but not anymore. You‚Äôre probably better off using Apple Maps because they have train routes all over the place now. | Tells you to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to another one of their free apps.  Then this app is only free for 3 days.  The app will not allow you to do anything, says support is ending soon.  Money wasted on this. | After using for a few days, the app locked itself up. 

Interface is terrible to navigate. Resource intensive app. Slowed my phone. | Very helpful to decide if I should travel by transit or taxi. | Confusing. No start option or Go option. No en rout help. Just shows a picture of the total route. You‚Äôre on your own. | Used this for a month in Tokyo and it was most useful for getting around.  Highly recommended. | The route making is very mechanical. You should be able to use the train map to create your route just by tapping on the stations. Also, the app lacks information on what gates to take, what floor or platform number to go to. | confused a little to bkk visitors",4.5628,3296,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/3a/76/bb/3a76bb97-73df-7b3d-623c-e8ea01729b4d/mzl.pthcstas.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c6/81/b0/c681b0f3-eaa6-13c6-9e73-1c657dd98208/mzl.joqfwqva.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/b6/5f/66/b65f660a-e53f-5b05-e697-b2b433d355ef/mzl.iirzesut.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5d/ea/bd/5deabded-6e70-0891-eb00-3eae628270e1/mzl.qrkvmiuu.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/27/11/2a/27112adc-7783-c26a-997e-cd85dea81859/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/95/11/25/951125b6-e314-eda2-8547-bc3360761e09/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/d0/2d/97/d02d97db-22ea-3ad7-1686-c27db48f6ad0/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/59/a7/c2/59a7c26f-c23b-d99a-bab3-457e72a43cc0/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/18/f9/28/18f9289b-af6e-0a8b-3ab0-8de4bce7da1a/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Before my account was set to renew, I cancelled it. However, they charged me anyway. The kicker is my account still says I have a free account and says that I shouldn‚Äôt have been charged. I was charged and don‚Äôt even have access to the service. To make matters worse, I reached out to the company thinking they could provide me with some clarity on why they charged me. They can‚Äôt even find the charge in their system. They keep telling me to reach out to PayPal and Apple. The charge was on my CREDIT CARD, not via PayPal or Apple. They don‚Äôt even know how their own system works. Extremely disappointed in Couchsurfing and I‚Äôve lost all faith in their company and app. Whatever you do, do NOT give them any credit card information. This company steals money from the people it claims to ‚Äúhelp.‚Äù | Couchsurfing, once hailed as the ultimate platform for travelers seeking free lodging and cultural exchange, has seen significant changes that have stirred mixed feelings within its community. The app, renowned for connecting like-minded adventurers and hosts around the globe, has transitioned from a completely free service to a model that now requires payment, a shift that has left many users disenchanted.

Historically, Couchsurfing stood out for its emphasis on cultural exchange and hospitality, fostering a sense of global camaraderie. It was a unique platform where the currency was kindness and the sharing of experiences, rather than money. Hosts opened their homes without any expectation of financial compensation, offering travelers a place to stay and local insights that enriched their journey.

However, the introduction of a payment requirement to use the platform fundamentally alters its original ethos. Users now must pay to verify their accounts or subscribe to access full features, including hosting or staying with others. This move, while understandable from a business sustainability perspective, has sparked a debate on the core values of Couchsurfing.

For long-time users, this shift feels like a departure from the community-first philosophy that made Couchsurfing special. The requirement to pay can be seen as a barrier that might deter new members and diminish the pool of available hosts and surfers, potentially impacting the rich diversity and vibrancy of the community.

Despite these changes, it's important to acknowledge the positives that remain. Couchsurfing continues to be a platform that can offer unparalleled opportunities for cultural exchange and making global connections. The app's functionality, user interface, and the breadth of its community still stand as strong points, providing users with the tools to explore the world in a more personal and profound way than traditional tourism allows.

In conclusion, while the transition to a paid model marks a significant shift in Couchsurfing's journey, the core appeal of connecting with locals and travelers worldwide persists. Users who are willing to pay may still find the app a valuable resource for authentic travel experiences. However, the platform may need to find a balance between financial sustainability and maintaining the spirit of community and openness that defined its early years to retain its place in the hearts of the global travel community. | If you express any kind of boundaries up front, you‚Äôll be met with nothing or aggression. Without boundaries expressed outright, you‚Äôll be flooded with hosts requests. Really shows the intentions of most hosts on the app. Have yet to meet another woman on it. | It functions ok on my iPhone but several things are strange, text fields overlapping, simply aesthetically off. I travel for a living and couch surfing has helped me to save money on hotels. I wish I there was a trip-routing feature on the app. | This app has given me wings to fly to Japan, Sweden, Germany, Kenya, Singapore, India and so many more places. 

I am eternally grateful to couchsurfing and the many wonderful people I met while on the journey. Live long and prosper, CS! | Excelente app para conocer, asistir y ayudar a amigos de todo el mundo. Los invito a conocer La Habana Vieja. Un abrazo desde Cuba. | It‚Äôs a great app for meeting friends and traveling new places. Unfortunately, you have to spend a lot of money to get verified, and the app is extremely buggy and poorly written. It frequently takes five seconds to do something very very simple. Or it will forget to notify you that you got a message. Very difficult and unpleasant to use. | Stole $60 from me over 6 years ago when I simply followed their instructions for verification. Never used the app after that because I won‚Äôt support scammers. They just tried running my credit card again. They should be charged with financial crimes. | This app is my favorite app of all time but I wish for using the app properly we wouldn‚Äôt need to make a payment | I‚Äôm not gonna pay for an app like this before i know if it works and isn't a scam. If you're gonna charge for your app charge in the app store, not after download and account setup. | When people ask me about Couchsurfing this is what I tell them‚Ä¶

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like visiting your favorite cousin who happens to live where you want to travel most!

The future people you‚Äôll meet on here, are the kindest souls you could ever find. 
 What greater show of kindness is there than welcoming a complete stranger into your most private space [your home] ??

My experience:

Pick up from the airport 
Cooking meals & being introduced to foods you‚Äôd never taste
Guitar serenades
Salsa dancing
Deep late conversations 
Laughs until the sun rises.

These precious people are Ambassadors of there cities & countries, & they give you there time so that you can simply enjoy‚Ä¶ | I‚Äôve hosted in the past and had great experiences with travelers. I payed a lump sum to get verified and had to send pictures of my place‚Ä¶ which I was fine with. Now they are asking for a fee every month. I‚Äôd be willing to pay something when I had a guest but not a fee each month no matter what. | It is truly the buggiest app I‚Äôve ever used, and they charge for it! Disappointing, can‚Äôt wait for a better alternative to create a competition for them. | This is the best app to know more about different cultures and languages we feel like a big family helping each others around the world 
I really advise everyone to use it and share it | Hice el pago del a√±o y no se porque en la aplicaci√≥n aparece un correo electr√≥nico que no es el m√≠o, cuando intento cambiarlo en la app para poder confirmar mi cuenta y poder avanzar no me permite cambiarlo | Search by area on map instead of running multiple searches for myriad municipalities that converge on a given zone. | The best app for travelers | Knew about Couchsurfing for many years when it was just a website. Reconnected to it now that I‚Äôm back traveling and through this app. Glad it exists! | The app has significant bugs (like you can‚Äôt login from different devices and I had to contact administrators in order to update my email).  A lot of users are inactive too.  I cancelled my subscription after a couple days.  Definitely not worth it. | Dont download, they stole from me 56 euros for verification!!

They dont want to refund | I just reported this place to the Better Business Bureau. They charged my credit card for a lifetime membership and now I cannot log back into my account because they say it‚Äôs inactive. I‚Äôm not sure if it was a lifetime or if it was a year, but the point is that is really shady. The verification was only supposed to verify my identity. This company is bad. | Used this since 2007. Now they charge $3 even if you are hosting. Scammers.
App is always buggy on iPhone. The new ownership severely neglects and the wuality deteriorates as more and more hosts leave and more and more freeloaders flood in. Sad. | If there‚Äôs a subscription fee for using the service why not just saying it instead of calling it ‚Äúdonation‚Äù? How can I trust a company playing tricks like this? | I submitted a request to surf with an ambassador of the couchsurfing app which was denied with no comment. When I requested again for different days and inquired if his denial, he did the same thing again. I go to his reviews and see only white people and people of Spanish descent, so of course, I took this to be racially motivated. I left a review stating that Winston will approve or deny your request based on race and that was removed as they considered it ‚Äúbullying and harassment.‚Äù I‚Äôve had several interactions such as this and couch surfing always seems to back up the racist, coincidence huh? | CouchSurfing and its community is what the World needs more of!! I started 10 years ago and it changed my life. Now about the app: The good: The app keeps getting better. Features are really useful. I love that you can read the communication history after joining a Hangout chat. The bad: Bugs with notifications, I get notified sometimes hours after messages are sent. The messaging in Hangouts feature is quite slow, people quickly move to WhatsApp. I wish the feature ""people traveling to your city"" would also be in the app, and not only on the website. | The first thing this app wants is a per month fee (or per year) or else u can‚Äôt use the app. Then they encourage u to spend $60 to get verified so you‚Äôll be able to find a host faster. I paid $60 + $15 yearly fee = $75. I sent about 20 requests to ~ 20 hosts in Los Angeles area. I was rejected by all 20. I suspect it‚Äôs b/c I am new to couch surfing and don‚Äôt have any references. 

But then it begs the question‚Ä¶ How do I get references if hosts will not accept me??!! My advice to travelers wanting to save money - spend money on a well rated hostel eg use the Hostel World app. The $75 I spent is easily a one night stay at a top rated hostel | So what I‚Äôm seeing is the movement has been hijacked my greedy people,, seeing as you can‚Äôt access ANYTHING without paying first, uh yeah that‚Äôs called a scam people run away lol | Don‚Äôt used 
Don‚Äôt like Muslim and Arabic people 
Please give home 1 stars all time | Don‚Äôt pay anything! It blames COVID for lack of activity but, it seems to be just a way to get money because you can‚Äôt access the app until you pay. Then, you see no one has been active for 3-9 years!! Even the reviews are old! Luckily, I only paid for one month. | There needs to be a way to see past hangouts and the people that attended them. | This is the best travel app for solo travelers. So many opportunities to meet new people and make friends all over the world. | You have to pay up front before you can check it out. I'm not subscribing to something before I even know anything about it. | As the title said CSing is an amazing experience and you can meet incredible people around the world. | Can‚Äôt even see how the app works because they need money . no thanks . | This app forces you to contribute a donation before you get to even see the Home Screen. | they charge you a monthly subscription fee just to browse. once i used the search feature i realized many of the hosts are not active and have not been in years | I recommend app, cs help me open USA | I probably wouldn‚Äôt mind contributing for a good experience that helps me build a local social network, but not before I can even try it. | After signing up you can't use the app unless you pay $4 a month or $15 a year‚Ä¶ 

Otherwise the only thing you could do is delete the account or logout‚Ä¶

 i'm sure the idea is nice‚Ä¶ 

But the execution is terrible. | They ban you for whatever reason. But they are quick to take your money and not giving back a refund. You‚Äôre all a bunch a lunatic thieves | TSIA. Unable to use. | 1 star! : Contributions should be voluntary. I can‚Äôt even see the portal without a subscription.

A bit of overkill that makes it easier to just call the restaurant and avoid the app. | This is my go to dining app. I even used it internationally! | We always have difficulty using Open Table when making reservations for our favorite restaurant. It‚Äôs so frustrating! | Always a delicious meal. The staff is absolutely wonderful and the drinks are the best. Try a martini‚Ä¶.you will love them. | Open table app is easy to use, can be added to your calendar and sends an email reminder

Been using it for years. | Alex was great.  Perfect mix of friendly and attentive. | The food is always excellent and the wine is fine. Service is also just right | This app is OK and if you book through it, there is seldom any problem at the restaurant you choose. No lost reservations, time or party size mix ups. BUT, the app can be frustrating. Click for a place ‚Äúnear by‚Äù and it skips places I know are members and within a few miles and shows places that are 40-50 miles away. That is just not ‚Äúnear by‚Äù. Another grand gaff, is showing restaurants that are nearby, but only if you are boating not driving. In Watch Hill RI, it shows me places in Long Island 20+ miles away by boat ü§® | I love Open Table as opposed to other apps like Yelp. Been using Open Table for at least 8-10 years.üëç | Open table is a great service. We use it all the time. Makes making reservations very easy. | So, I‚Äôm searching for a restaurant in Manchester, NH and when it kept bringing up only 3 options, even though there‚Äôs at least 5 since two other places came up when I searched for sushi or Italian. So I went to the search bar and tapped ‚ÄúAll restaurants‚Äù and then many more restaurants came up‚Ä¶ because the map jumped to Manchester, England. So, I tried expanding my search field to include concord NH. And then it brought me to Concord, Italy.

I understand Manchester is a miserable excuse for a city, but I was not expecting the app to suggest I take a transatlantic flight for dinner tonight lol | Love being able to go on vacation, and, in advance of arrival, being able to find great restaurants, and to easily make reservations too! Also love being rewarded with gift checks just by making my reservations online on Open Table!! I sometimes stumble upon a restaurant while driving, then will open Open Table on my phone, make a reservation, then walk in!! Works great, love seeing the menus, and the reviews in advance of arrival! Great app! Great time saver and planner! Denise & Tom Newport RI | Verification is getting harder than ever.. makes me want to rez directly | Love Bulla Gastrobar. Hate using Open Table for reservations!!! Open Table always requires a new account and cannot seem to keep track of a cell phone for reservations without an email associated. Then it needs a password associated with the email. Each time sending a 6 digit code to verify the phone and email work; why is a password needed if you just sent a code? | Love OT but it won‚Äôt let me reserve dinner before our speakeasy reservation. | So fun, efficient and fast making reservations on  open table! | OpenTable is a fantastic resource for travelers looking to discover and book great restaurants. Its convenience and helpful features make it a go-to platform for finding dining options while on the go. | Amazing | Louka never fails and always satisfies. Wonderful menu , ambience, educated staff and central to all that Beverly Hills has to offer.
Louka is the only true Greek restaurant in the area. Yes there are those that claim Mediterranean , none that serve your palate with a cuisine that has been awarded the 3rd healthiest in the world. A menagerie of Greek wines from Santorini and the mainland will surprise your palate and change your mind .
One of our favorites in Beverly Hills. This is not a corporate restaurant. It‚Äôs s one of a kind gem . | Open Table is very convenient for making and changing reservation for those restaurants that use it. | This app is so handy for getting a table and finding good places to eat | Not sure what I'd do without this concierge. Nearly 400 reservations, reviews that matter, and recommendations based on my preferences; what could be better? | I just got a notification reminding me about a reservation I made 8 years ago. Not every reservation is something I‚Äôd like to be remind of. This was creepy. | Love this app. | We have never had a bad experience here!  The steaks are always prepared to perfection and our service has been impeccable! | This is my first time on Open Table and I was surprised and happy to learn how easy it was to use.  Thank you! | But it finally works.  Why do I have to do 2-part Both vain a text and an e-Mail!? | That UI is a bit confusing.  Thought I had made reservation but no confirmation.
Had to poke around, just guessing, and finally got a confirmation. | Great tool with good information on restaurant of interest. Easy to make a reservation. | Very efficient system and extremely helpful information!! | Great experience! | Convenient way to nail a table even on busy weekends. | The app sends unwanted notifications, for marketing and unrelated to it‚Äôs. | Pretty useful, but obviously lacks the ability to filter in more than just the most basic ways. Take a look at your competitors and copy them. They know what they‚Äôre doing! | This app is very helpful when traveling out of town | Great app! Works well | Love this App!! So convenient and made easy to adjust to your accommodations with no issue!! | The open table app is a complete pain to use! | Love using the open table app.. It‚Äôs very convenient and has a lot of different restaurants to choose from! | We had a 6:00 reservation got seated at 6:35.   Then took forever to get waited on.  Then they forgot our salads. Then they brought our food much later.   Then it took another 10 minutes for our 2 kids food to arrive.  We I‚Äôll never go back‚Äî-to many other restaurants in the area that are clearly better!  Really a bummer. | Just ok. | While I use app mostly when I am traveling there is no substitute for getting fed on a busy night in town. | I use Open Table frequently to book reservations. | In general, my experiences with OpenTable are easy and successful. | This is the best app. I never go to a restaurant that I can‚Äôt make a reservation | Love Open Table!! I‚Äôve had it for years. I do wish they would add a way to filter for restaurants that gluten free menus or options. I get tired of call restaurants or scrolling through their menus. | I wish I knew what points were for. | Have a shot of Henny ready please lol | We have used open table for a number of high end

At this point, my best option is to delete my account, and the membership fee is not refundable. | I have hosted several workers and this app is meant for work in exchange if stay and explore, well this app does not let host get help in small business it will cancel your profile and tell you ti hire locally, this is a work away app isn‚Äôt, it has the word work in their name, so pls hosts with Businesses to run avoid making a profile on this nonsense app and workers don‚Äôt look for work here you will not get paid for any host on here. Waste of time and efforts and money for workers. | I have several friends who use this app, and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but it will not let me create a profile or create an account. I don‚Äôt know if this is a glitch in the app or if there‚Äôs a completely different way to sign up that is just not known. | I‚Äôve been looking for opportunities farther than a month out and everything‚Äôs full. Hosts who have profiles saying they have availability all text back saying they‚Äôre full. The ID verification system wouldn‚Äôt accept my passport nor my license. It is frustrating and feels futile. I wish I hadn‚Äôt paid the $60 for us to use this app. It‚Äôs a nice idea though. | The fact that hosts register for free and backpackers have to ‚Äúpay‚Äù to sign up for this platform to work for hosts for free is already a goddamn unfairness. Useless platform, full of entitled and racist hosts. Honestly, I shouldn‚Äôt have even signed up, one of my biggest regrets. Such a waste of money. | I have found amazing volunteer opportunities with free accommodation, which have been great learning experiences. Very grateful for Workaway and would recommend it to any budget traveler or a person looking to gain more hands-on experience in a field they‚Äôre interested in! | Great App but instead of connecting you to the website when clicking on menus, build it into the app so it doesnt always refer you to another webpage to the certain menu. | I love using Workaway to find places to travel, but the app is really bad. It‚Äôs super frustrating to use. It has a ton of glitches, bad filters for looking for places and overall hard to use. | Unfortunately this app could be a great travel-networking app, but it ends up being just an exploitative experience. 
Working five hours a day, five days a week, often leaves the traveler without much time to do anything that is fun. The exception is when you get a host particularly good at taking their workawayers for local hikes, events and to nearby attractions as part of the schedule. But most f the time its just a person or business who wants to get free labor and push you along out the door as soon as they aren't. 

You have to really get a good host invested in making it a balanced experience, which in seven months of being a member and actively using the app, I've found 1 out of every 7 hosts actually are going to make it a good experience. 

So be careful, rate often, and choose wisely. | Work away blocked my account because they said I sent to many messages that was spam , Work Away  is a rip off and will not be good ‚Ä¶ until their app Works | The app needs a lot of work | Won‚Äôt let me log in. I log in just fine on my browser. Useless | Easy to use and a great way to make connections !   ‚ù§Ô∏è | It keep asking me to log in when I haven‚Äôt even made a account. It won‚Äôt show a make a account option either | I‚Äôm a verified member. I use the website with no problems all the time. But every time I try to login on the App, I fail to login. This has been going for months now. 

FIX IT for God‚Äôs sake. | Great ! | Very easy to use! | They have fake offers and inactive hosts to catch people to pay their membresy. They ask a very expensive fee to apply, I paid for it because they had 4 great opportunities. Just one of the hosts responded to say they were not hiring people because of covid. I asked my money back and they say it‚Äôs not possible. | How can I create a profile ? , is only asking me to log in into a already existing account | Having a great time using the WorkAway app- very easy to use, simplifies a lot of things. Love the ‚Äúmap‚Äù feature while searching for my next destination | Hoooyeah!! | Thank u so much for giving us this amazing app !! | Filter button not working, please fix. | App is easy and a lot of choices! Only downside is sometimes the app will glitch and wont let me click on certain tabs. | A traves de workaway podes alojarte en muchas partes del mundo mediante intercambio de trabajo, lo que es una excelente idea y maravillosa herramienta. 

Igualmente, creo que podrian exigir mas especificidad sobre el tipo y las horas de trabajo que pide cada anfitrion, asi como lo que ofrece respecto de comida, alojamiento y tiempo libre. Muchos anfitriones se vuelven muy exigentes y se olvidan de que estan alojando unx voluntarix, no unx empleadx con goce de sueldo.

Tambien con respecto a algo mas urgente, cuando se le envia un mensaje a unx anfitrionx, desde el mismo mensaje deberia ser posible redirigirse a la solicitud, asi podemos recordar con quien estamos hablando. Cuando alguien que viaja se quiere poner en contacto don dos o tres personas que son anfitrionas en el lugar de destino, se olvida de quien representa qu√© lugar, y se genera mucha confusion.  

Gracias. | It‚Äôs a perfect way to connect with people so far!!! | I‚Äôve both hosted and been hosted through Workaway and have had lots of great experiences through it all.  Thank you | It‚Äôs an awesome application that connects people with the same interest ! 
I just love it and loved everyone I met through it! | Workaway is the best program in the world! Easy to use and I love the profiles | TrustedHouseSitters is so much better.  Was hoping to switch gears for a stay in CA and volunteer.  Slim pickings.  The app is not good.  A huge waste of money. | Every is like the website which is one of the best ‚ÄúWorkaway‚Äù websites I've seen, but needs to be able to go landscape/portrait mode | I definitely met best people here but customers service. I‚Äôm transgender guy  and I prefer to make more ladies friend as my travel buddy, so mostly I talk with ladies and I got warning saying that..avoid taking with only female member this is not dating site, when I explained about my situation they terminated.. | I have this app downloaded on my iPhone as well as my iPad Pro. My only critical feedback is that the App does not rotate from Portrait to Landscape with the rotation of the device. I am a vision impaired person and the ability to better see, type on my iPad is compromised by the lack of this particular feature. 
Is this capability something that can be added? I would rate this at 5 stars if it was.
Thanks! | Needs improvement. Trying to select hosts, links not working. Should be able to find someone in your area as a traveling buddy. Otherwise what‚Äôs the point? | I was so excited to find the app, but it gives me a blank screen 60% of the time when I click on a host. Guess I‚Äôll stick to my PC. | Yup | I faced few times errors when I wanted to log in to my account while using the App. | From what I can tell, there‚Äôs no way to search without choosing a location. A significant bummer because I find my next destination by discovering great opportunities that match my interests. I‚Äôve found myself in some pretty unexpected places this way, and been the better for it. I wish you could do a worldwide search based on skills, language, setting, etc. As it is, this app is pretty useless for me. | WorkAway has become my key to traveling the world at a fraction of the cost that it would for most people. The site has been great to use, but the app is even cleaner and makes searching for hosts and navigating all the functions even smoother.

Tried booking my flight there and it kept throwing an error when the prices were low. Tried again the next day and the same error. Now the prices are double and customer service is not answering. Terrible app and company. | check in process does not offer possibility to chosd seat, in spite of expectation to be able too
very disappointing and not conform to promise | Every time I attempt to login through the app, I‚Äôm given an error message saying an unexpected error has occurred and to contact support. I can login on the website fine, so I know it‚Äôs not my username or password. | Download twice today launch it and it hangs on the opening graphic
No amount of touching will make it go beyond this screen 
Wife on Android works fine
So much for the hyped Apple ecosystem | Super cumbersome platform  to use - it is hard to find where to type a confirmation number 
The upcoming flights are not showing automatically | It switches you from business class to economy class so be careful | Will not work on my phone, just crashes | They don‚Äôt support Apple Wallet, and you must use this app to get your pass instead, except that when scanning the QR code of my ticket I‚Äôm just taken to the app but nothing happens. It‚Äôd be simpler if they just used Apple Wallet, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel (and the wheel doesn‚Äôt even work). | Whoa this app is bad. Learn from other airline apps like Delta and do better. | app has a lot of errors when going backwards to previous pages or also when checking in | The app is useless as I keep getting refresh message instead of my dashboard | I have been trying to add the flexing blue card to the Apple wallet but it doesn‚Äôt work. Either from the website or from the mobile app. I hope you will fix this soon | Prices are different when looking on computer browser vs. phone vs. tablet.  Also, app *conveniently* throws an error when trying to book the cheapest ticket.  It is deceptive and most likely illegal to show differing prices across different platforms.  Classic bait and switch as others have mentioned.  I have screenshots to prove this. | While visually pleasing, practically it‚Äôs difficult up for basic things like seat assignments and checkin. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to select separate seats when traveling with someone forcing you to sit side by side. 

Why are seat maps pulled several days before departure where no assignment is possible? Where do they go? It‚Äôs inconsistent and often unable to do seats on partner Delta in the same record. | Outstanding service to ALL | I‚Äôve gotten the ‚ÄúSorry, something went wrong‚Ä¶please try again‚Äù error more times than I can count.

I can book the tickets online but will need the app on travel day and fear it won‚Äôt work. | I've gotten the worst treatment and run around from any single air line company in my life. My flight was cancelled workout notification. So confusing | I reloaded the app a million times and it‚Äôs still vertical.  Screen lock is NOT on.  I give up. It‚Äôs super annoying | I use my Airfrance app a lot to book flights to France, but now I‚Äôm having g a problem with Airfrance app! The app keeps crashing for 2 months now, I cannot use it for anything. What is the problem with the app?!!? Can someone please fix this issue? | I downloaded the Air France app in the Stuttgart, Germany to check in and manage my return flights to the United States the the prior to my departure. At first, everything worked well. Then, on the day of travel, the app ceased functioning at, of all places, 
Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in the Air France Lounge. Its symptoms were simply the app would begin to open then stopped and closed. Repeated attempts to use it resulted in the same failures. I tried deleting it from my iPhone and reloading it, but it still failed to open. Fortunately I had a hard copy of my boarding passes and had saved soft copies on my iPhone. I have no suggestions for the app‚Äôs failure as it worked on my iPhone the day before my flight, only to crash and burn the day I actually needed its services. | There is a lot to desire. First when asked for either loyalty number or email, the app doesn‚Äôt allow for the loyalty number. Then you are asked for captcha for every transaction. And then authentication method is so warped that I have given up.  If I had a known this before, I might have chosen a different airline as the airline apps are more and more important. | The app works well and customer support is great if you have an issue. | Their website booked me the ticket without asking for my confirmation or payment. Took me an hour to cancel. | Great job! | After picking flight with price and inputting name and other information, the next screen tells you ‚Äúsince you selected the flight the price has increased by ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù. This is something close to bait and switch scams but after booking 3 flights with the same price increase after selecting the flight it is clear Air France and KLM are just scamming customers with misleading prices on flights.

1520656722,"gov.dhs.cbp.pspd.mpc","Mobile Passport Control","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobile-passport-control/id1520656722?uo=4","Mobile Passport Control (MPC) is an official application created by U.S. Customs and Border Protection that streamlines your CBP processing experience at select U.S. entry locations. Simply fill out your traveler profile, answer CBP inspection-related questions, and proceed straight to the ‚ÄúMobile Passport Control‚Äù lane at the airport or seaport. 

MPC is a voluntary program which can be used by U.S. Citizens, Canadian Citizen Visitors, Lawful Permanent Residents, and Visa Waiver Program Visitors at any of the supported airport and seaport locations found on our website: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/mobile-passport-control 

MPC provides a more efficient, secure in-person inspection process for the CBP Officer and the traveler, and shortens overall entry wait times. 


MPC can be used in 6 simple steps:

1. Create a traveler profile using biographic information from your passport; You can create a profile for all eligible members in a family group. Your profiles will be securely stored on your device completely free to be used for future travel.

2. Select your method of travel, select your port of entry and terminal (if applicable), answer CBP inspection-related questions, certify the truthfulness and accuracy of your answers, and, upon arriving at your selected port of entry, tap the ‚ÄúSubmit Now‚Äù button.

3. Capture a clear and unobstructed photo of each traveler (including yourself) that you added to your submission.

4. Once your submission is processed, CBP will send a virtual receipt back to your device.

5. Proceed to the MPC designated lane upon arrival and be prepared to present your passport and other relevant travel documents. Please note: MPC does not replace your passport; your passport will need to be presented to the CBP Officer.

6. The CBP Officer will complete the inspection. If further information is required, the CBP Officer will let you know.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/a9/95/89/a9958932-7ebc-c1bf-9858-f2a7bc804761/AppIcon-0-1x_U007ephone-0-0-0-0-sRGB-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel""]","[""6003""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN"",""FR"",""ES""]","49446912","15.0","2021-05-11T07:00:00Z","2024-02-27T17:04:45Z","Additions

Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, all lanes marked with MPC closed and I stood in an MPCqueue that was merged with regular passengers. My tax dollars at work. | Easy to use. | Muy bueno y f√°cil de usar. | Wait time is high!! | We will know more when we arrive back in the US and go through US border control. | haven‚Äôt dealt with mistakes | There WAS a separate lane at EWR where you could use the MPC and skip the big line. Now, everyone uses the same line, making this app absolutely useless. What a total waste of my time. | App itself is great and easy to use, but after all the effort to enter data for the whole family, to realize MPC counters are already closed for the day. In this age, should this info be updated on the app instead of let you find out only when you arrive at custom | Don‚Äôt waist your time using this app for going through customs at JFK airport. The system is not working there. | I downloaded the app and it immediately started asking for all my information. When I got to the end then it assumed I was already waiting to go through customs. The information expires in 4 hours. My flight is not until tomorrow so it was a total waste of time. | I took all the time to sign up for MPC while in Mexico.   Then today arriving in Charlotte, I couldn‚Äôt access it because of WIFI issues. That was a huge waste of time.  It was no help. Finally in the baggage claim area I could get it. | Do quick and easy!
Thank you! | Easy and quick and always a help. | Great app for saving time and security process. | I recently used this app at PHX Sky Harbor. The normal customs line was huge but the MPC line was only 2 people. It‚Äôs very easy to set up- just answer a few questions, scan your passport, and take a selfie of yourself. You could honestly get it all done while still sitting in the plane after landing. | Easy to use | This is a great way to accelerate one‚Äôs entrance to the US. I require a wheelchair and  I am always worried I‚Äôm going to miss my connection to my final destination. Peace of mind for crazy traveling time.Thanks. | Zero effort, incredible customs experience with the best staff and agent. Highly recommend. | For some reason the app (deleted and reloaded several times to check) no longer submits the form when I arrive at any airport. | It could be ok, but it throws an error every time for me | I‚Äôve used this app and there‚Äôs been times I‚Äôve gone through the line super quickly and other times border control only had one designated lane and so it was about the same length of time as for the regular. | This app cause us to miss our flight.  The regular Passport line was 20 min faster!!! | I had a separate line to go through because I had used this app. Much faster than the other lines at the Seattle airport. | Amazing tools to provide fast access and easy thanks | I think they nailed it.  Simple and user friendly process.   Enough said. | All ready to ‚Äúspeed through‚Äù customs. We were told as soon as hit the concourse that it isn‚Äôt used here anymore. | No CBP/MPC lane in LAX terminal 7 although the app has one listed. Disappointed. | Works great | Very good makes life easier | Easy process to sign up. | Terminal 8 AA is horrible. If you are flying in MPC is not accepted | Absolutely awesome app. Kudos to CBP | Aside from having difficulty due to server issue, after several attempts, submission was successful | This app is simple, intuitive and a big time saver. | We tried this app on Monday when we arrived to Miami. It was the slowest line of all, the green card holders and tourists‚Äô lines were a lot faster. And they ask the same questions again. I will not use it again. There was a lady in front of me and she was saying the same, it was worse. Very bad experience. There was just 1 person for all of the ones that used the MPC app. | Delete | Didn‚Äôt work. No explanation why. Useless app.  Exactly what I‚Äôd expect from a government app | I entered Minnesota but there was no place to use the app, long line such a waste of time!!! | I set up this entry for my family and when we got to LAX, the line only had 15 people in it.  Huge win right?   Wrong.  Each person took at LEAST 5 minutes to get through the immigration officer, and the like took longer than friends who went through the normal line that had 300 people in front of them.  Was beyond annoyed after a 12 hour flight, thinking this would be faster, and it was a disaster.   No idea why, but on this trip, using the mobile passport app was a disaster.   Instead I‚Äôve applied for global entry. | Security would not allow me to pull the app up on my phone or stand in the MPC line, then while standing in the customs line, their ‚Äúfree airport Wi-Fi ‚Äú and the ‚Äúfree accessible border security Wi-Fi‚Äù would not connect without an I.D. and password, no instructions were provided for either, so an absolutely useless and frustrating experience. Do not waste your time. If airports aren‚Äôt going to ensure and allow access to the app and use of Wi-Fi, just stop advertising this app and go back to paper. | Everytime I get in the MPC line it takes longer than the normal line. Typically only one agent at the MPC booth | So easy to set up and use. Fly through customs. | The flight staff pushed us into a line then refused to let us use the express lanes because we didn‚Äôt show them the app before we got in line | Came into Newark recently, made my submissions with all the families pics and passports and then the agent said he didn‚Äôt see any of it loaded into the system. What‚Äôs the point? | I took my first international trip in 10 years and someone recommended this app and I‚Äôm glad I listened.  I had a 1 hr 20 minute layover in Atlanta and would have not made my connection had I not had this app.  I went to the head of the line at immigration and it took me all of 20 seconds to be on my way. | Love this step before arrival, very easy to use application. | This app is literally TERRIBLE  The people who work at the airport HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO HELP WITH EVER!!!!! Waste of time EVERY SINGLE TIME | Superb | It doesn‚Äôt help when airport has MPC lines closed. Just standing in line like everyone else",4.89548,195128,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6e/e0/86/6ee086a3-1928-4af0-ecbc-8db07ce54a1d/9c820458-e344-4b38-b1f8-df7a66425632_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-11-29_at_11.17.09.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/1b/93/3c/1b933cd7-fbe0-57f3-b2f5-6481a3804906/1205d743-b393-4b1f-8587-a4e00125a6d7_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-10-16_at_09.08.17.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b4/c2/2b/b4c22b7f-5e00-057f-9997-2afb3ce87f2b/c7c63256-2137-4960-8bb6-e4c97f6a8110_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-10-16_at_09.08.19.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/74/d8/71/74d8714c-6821-25b8-5439-798eb97d95be/f526e9b0-1176-4949-853c-7701a8146fcb_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-10-16_at_09.08.23.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/0b/2a/c7/0b2ac787-51f1-c81c-04ff-6e2bd2b18194/bf35c829-11db-4d94-a60a-8aec954066e4_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-12-11_at_08.28.37.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/59/69/dd/5969ddaa-0fea-2e25-1e68-e3e0a86ba960/e308dda2-75bf-4cf1-be7c-1a336ee599bc_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-10-16_at_09.09.16.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2c/29/1b/2c291b43-43f2-d3bb-b296-0c3295ecfb82/9e63cbc5-f357-4183-b689-7da00693e745_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-10-16_at_09.08.41.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/50/9b/54/509b5490-88f0-ae0e-eace-99c9bf34c04a/d7dd9ed5-6fff-4b75-a94a-a32d2fd1fb58_Simulator_Screenshot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-11-13_at_10.13.42.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/de/a2/cc/dea2cc01-879a-17b0-e5f4-97290880ce31/49925521-ef45-4947-8cd1-03f58df70aee_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_Plus_-_2023-07-10_at_12.48.41.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPho

It‚Äôs a refreshing and welcomed process from the traditional rental. I love being able to choose a car based on my mood, the occasion or the destination. I‚Äôm always looking forward to my next ride! | I really enjoy rent for Turo. | It‚Äôs nice to have vehicle available in your own town. | My husband and I have hosted on turo for 2 years and have made Turo lots of money. We had a bad renter who didn‚Äôt return our car and stole it. In order to get it back we had to find it in the city, retrieve it ourselves, and there were remnants of drugs in the car and a floor mat had been lit on fire. We are working with Roman from Turo support who refuses to refund us for the total loss of our car. | I have used Turo 3 times now and everything has worked out great each time. You always get the car you choose and everyone so far has been very respectful and accommodating    Ron | I recently took a trip to Washington state and absolutely loved it. The host was very quick to respond when I had questions regarding pickup and drop off. 

However, after drop off, we encountered an issue. A smoking report was submitted by the host. Prior to our trip, I became familiar with the smoking policy, additional rules, and guidelines. Therefore, there was no smoking involved in the vehicle. We would never subject one of our passengers in the car, who is a few months pregnant, to any of that. Anyway, after Turo reviewed the images the host submitted, customer service informed me that I was going to receive a reimbursement for the misunderstanding. However, I was charged again. Why would customer service say they would refund me and yet follow through with it a day later? 

I‚Äôd like to remind you that the most difficult odor to eradicate anywhere is that of marijuana. I therefore requested further investigation that marijuana may have been present, but they hesitantly said that the dispute was resolved. Did they not value my voice? Since customer service gave me vague responses and never responded to my emails, they were little to no help. I found this incredibly frustrating, as I was falsely being accused of violating the smoking policy without any supporting documentation. It's absurd; the host's photos, which we truly wish we could attach, plainly depicted food crumbs and debris rather than marijuana! I would like to remind you that we visited a few trails and beaches where picking up debris from the rainfall, including moss, is inevitable. If Turo has ‚Äústrict smoking policies,‚Äù why would they solely rely on images to determine a violation?

I implore you, future guests, to advocate for yourself. I am 21 years old and believe I was taken advantage of due to my age because I can guarantee you that there was no smoking of any kind involved. So, please make sure to document everything! Take photos of the car's exterior and interior from all angles and in various lighting at pick up and drop off. Record the distance driven and the gas level before and after the drop-off. The most tedious areas of the vehicle were shown in the pictures that were sent along with the report the host submitted. Therefore, take photos of everything! Reconsider renting from here, it could cost you double, like our case. It has been two weeks since our trip and nothing has been resolved, but we are still in contact with Turo for this misunderstanding. 

To our host, I strongly advise you to educate yourself on the physical appearance and scent of marijuana for future guests before presuming anything that isn't true and accusing them unjustly of violating policies. Furthermore, provide additional ‚Äúvalid‚Äù assertions rather than depending just on what you observe. To avoid misunderstandings with future guests, I urge you to invest in smoke sensors that can identify specific components in both tobacco and marijuana smoke. Overall, the host's ignorance, the useless and indifferent customer service, and the way this whole thing transpired has left me feeling rather frustrated and dissatisfied. Future guests, please be cautious when booking here. | There have been times when I the person I was renting from was fraudulent in they‚Äôre dealings but I have experienced the best response from the Turo support. This has been a 5 star service and I recommend Turo to everyone possible. It‚Äôs service is great!! | Amazing app to make sure you are good ! | Been using Turo for about 4 years now and definitely beats the traditional rental car companies | Turo is great!

The fees are a bit high, but it‚Äôs still a pretty good deal. | I've been using Turo for YEARS and haven't used any other service since. It's a great looking app as well as being very easy to navigate (booking, contacting the host and they send out promo codes from time to time!). Would highly recommend to give it a try as a driver and/or listing your car on there! | I am so happy with using Turo. Three times I‚Äôve rented and been thrilled with the quality of the vehicle. I‚Äôm renting again the first week of May 1-8 through Turo for a trip to see our kid and grandkids in sunny California. | Highly recommended | The app is very user friendly and easy to use. The company is also convenient as are the drivers provided. | Great team to work with. I really appreciate everything you guys do for me. | This app is definitely a game changer!!! | The ease and straightforwardness if Turo makes it my go to for car rentals. I will never lease from a rental car agency again! | My host Alicia was very receptive and was easy to communicate with. They went above and beyond to keep the car running smoothly. We enjoyed driving the BMW convertible. We will use her again in the future. | I use Turo every time I travel. Takes me to all my favorite hiking spots and always have great communication with people I have rented from. Will never use Hertz (or other car rental company) again. | Turo is great, simple to use and convenient | I‚Äôve had nothing but good experiences renting through Turo! | Fast easy and reliable for all my adventures | Turo has really came throw for me in my time of need and I am so great full. | They deny me for no reason they discriminate plus they leak your information definitely wouldn‚Äôt use | Way better than traditional car rental would always recommend turo as the 1st option | I love the fact that I can pick my own vehicle, and I always get the unlimited mileage option. Great APP, easy, reliable and much better than the big auto rental companies. | Extremely happy with using this app to secure a car on trips. Not only is it far more reasonable but the cars are much nicer than the basic car rental. Will always do a Turo rental now! | I had an issue with someone we rented a car from. Customer service was very helpful and gave me a discount for my next rental. Anytime I had a question they have explained everything in a professional manner. | Turo makes renting so painless and simple. No extra or hidden fees. This is my preferred method of renting vehicles | I definitely enjoy using turo for and quick trip around town. So easy and efficient | Nice | very helpful and respectful... always checking in .. i would recommend this to everyone i know | Super easy to use and great prices | If you see reviews about Turo scamming and closing accounts, taking money that didn‚Äôt belong to them and canceling trips in the middle of your already paid booked trip‚Ä¶.. BELIEVE THEM. This app came off as legit at first and then each time I attempted to give them the benefit of the doubt, it always backfired on me. I knew it was just too good to be true. I referred two people to this app also and one of them is going through similar. I attempted to email and reach out and they randomly closed my account out. Not worth it!!!!!! | All other rental companies can forget about it and will never get my business again lol. Turo is affordable convenient whoever created GENIUS | I used Tito once and when the host cancelled hours before pick up time Turo found a new rental for $175 more than the original agreement.  They did not cover that cost nor did the host and Turo had us running in circles to discuss the concerns with customer service that did nothing to help | I have utilized Turo now multiple times and have been very pleased with the result. I truly believe it‚Äôs the best way to rent a car!! Thank you Turo, easy, safe, hassle free, wonderful vehicles to rent and pleasant people to work with! | Easy to use | No hassle | Excellent | Everything went Nice and Smoove | I had an exceptional experience hosting on Turo! The platform provided me with a seamless way to share my vehicle, and the support team was always there to assist. Not only did I earn extra income, but I also met some wonderful renters along the way. Turo made the entire process easy and rewarding. Highly recommended for anyone looking to share their car! | This is a great app. A very easy convenient way to rent a vehicle. I have rented over 10 vehicles and have enjoyed them all. The host were great the cars were awesome and Turo is the best. | It‚Äôs a awesome services!!

I saw a pilot and a flight attendant who took a seats over me. Not cool. | The app is so user friendly and easy to use.  This company makes it so easy to change flights to accommodate a schedule that often changes.  A-Lister for Life. | There is no easy way to find your current flight even if you are logged into the app with your account. You have to search for your reservation and check in every time to see your flight and then get to your boarding pass. Developers of this app, check out Alaska airlines or Delta apps. | I plan to get lots of flights with my companion for free this year!
Great program for frequent travelers!

Thanks | I had this app a while ago and it was fine. Now, it does not work at all. Says it is the wrong login info but it isn‚Äôt. Then it says I have reached the maximum tries and locks me out. I will go back to using the mobile site but what a pain. Grrrr | Early Bird was paid for‚Äîdidn‚Äôt happen. I am not a satisfied customer. | Thanks üëçSouthwest Airlines | Really like the Southwest app. I used it all the time I want to travel. Easy to transfer your boarding pass to your wallet from the southwest app if you have an apple phone. | The agent I chatted with said she added my points. That did not happen | Exceptional app. Easy to use | I have been a loyal southwest flyer for years but that has changed as of today for the last two years every experience we have had with you has been the worst case scenario and I do u destined we can‚Äôt control the weather but the customer service is the absolute worst I have ever experienced in my life you don‚Äôt care about your customers what so ever you just say sorry and move us along I am currently stuck in Orlando Florida and had to pay for another night stay and another days parking because of your airlines incompetence and to top it off you guys wouldn‚Äôt give me my luggage back so I have no clothes and toiletries so we are having to stay in our dirty clothes we wore and walked around in all day and my wife doesn‚Äôt have her medication either so you have lost a long time customer I will never fly with you guys again and I will deter anyone else from doing so also so basically thanks for nothing. | Gay gay gay | Easy to use Southwest app for our trip to puerto rico | I paid for an upgrade in boarding position and was charged but my boarding pass want upgraded to the new boarding group   Now I‚Äôll have to go through the line anyway.  Poorly functioning system!   Won‚Äôt be using this again. | We paid for priority check in and still got boarding passes at the end of A check in | The account creation is one of the most tedious, annoying, and brain rotting experiences I have EVER had with any app. If you can‚Äôt find a unique enough username, you then I have check going back and forth between pages to let the app autogenerate a password. Imm afraid no password will be unique enough for this stupid app. I wish I could get it zero stars, my sanity is gone. Fix this terrible feature | By far the easiest app to use among airlines with the most advanced technology. | There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any way to save the flights on my logged-in account. This app is 10 years old and feels like it. Basically useless | Love SW‚Ä¶..they would ALWAYS be MY Choice‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è | This is my preferred way to fly. Friendly people, on time, and great perks with the SW Visa card. | I love Southwest Airlines. I always choose to fly them online booking flight hotel and car are always easy. | After being notified of a flight change in an existing reservation, I needed to make an adjustment. A few clicks on the app, and the flight was updated to a more convenient flight. We love flying Southwest and the app makes booking (and making changes) easy. | This is a very easy to use app. Everything thing is laid out conveniently. | The app won‚Äôt let me add the boarding pass to apple wallet. Other airline apps work flawlessly. | I only use Southwest Airlines. Been traveling for 18 years with y‚Äôall üòçüòòü•∞ | The Southwest app is easy to navigate. I appreciate the luggage tracking as a new addition. | Several times my flight time has been changed and when I look at your flight schedules my original flight is still listed. When booking a flight I pick a flight based upon the availability of someone taking or picking me up. | I have all the tools I need to maximize my efficiency to fly Southwest. | Although | I‚Äôve not been able to access my Southwest Rewards account since creating it, so I reached out for assistance. Rachel (customer service) was extremely rude and dismissive of my concerns.  She did not allow me to ask questions or give me the opportunity to gain clarity on the instructions she provided.  She was demeaning and dismissive of me and my concerns, and she consistently (and intentionally) cut me off and spoke over me.  

I have always been team American Airlines, but I thought I would give Southwest Airlines a try.  I truly hope Rachel‚Äôs behavior is not indicative of how my family and I will be treated by all Southwest Airlines employees. 

Please go back and listen to our call.  I‚Äôm beyond disappointed in the treatment I received by Rachel. | This website and the associated app both do nothing but frustrate and annoy ( nicest way to put it) every time I try to sign in.  
   Even with all the needed information the site refuses to let myself or my husband sign in.  It ALWAYS ends in having to call and wait to get an operator on the line and once AGAIN reset my password.  And god forbid I try to use a new password with a word similar to any I‚Äôve used in the past.  The English language only has so many words and I‚Äôm running low on options. | Southwest is an amazing airline, very customer service oriented, which says a lot in the same age | I travel back and forth to Texas to visit with my treasured grandsons.  I love the convenience of flying out of a small airport 10 mins from house.  The flight attendants are awesome and generally very helpful. üòéThank Yiu Southwest!! | The cancellation of my original flight was disappointing, but there where several other flights to choose from.I think those folks should be compensated with *A*boarding. Thanks much! | Fix this app already | When I book a flight that‚Äôs the flight I want you come in and change it when it was a direct flight. Now I have a stop on both flights added three hours to each trip, leaving at the crack of dawn on my return trip so I have to get up at 5:30 AM to get to the airport. Not happy with Southwest they‚Äôre really going downhill. | We will fly Southwest to Burbank tomorrow and have already flown to New Orleans via Southwest during February, 2024. Southwest provides excellent service, convenient routes, and dependable times. We will fly Southwest Airlines whenever we are going where Southwest goes. | Great service! | We love to fly southwest we only wish they would fly into South Bend, Indiana! | So easy to use for a 70 year old grandmother! | Southwest is probably the most accommodating airline in existence. in the United States, we have ditched everything else. | The app keeps asking me to enable notifications but that‚Äôs not an option in settings. My phone and the app are updated so I have to assume it‚Äôs an app issue. Other than that the app works well but having notifications pushed to me on things  like delays and cancellations would be super helpful and one of the few notifications I‚Äôd like my phone to make. | I love Southwest will never take a flight with anyone else. I‚Äôve always had the upmost best service. I‚Äôve never had an issue. | Checked my bike bag in Albuquerque that divides into two, along with my folding bike. No problem. When I tried to check exactly the same thing at Reagan National, the clerk made them 3 bages and charged me an extra $125. I am done with Southwest, after flying with them for 25 years | I love it!!!!!   Best way to fly for me!!!!! | Still some bugs on this app.  Cant edit my information properly says I‚Äôm not on this flight, but I am. | Great experience this far!

Sorry to see this good app go down the tubes. I‚Äôve deleted it. | I got this app for my first camping trip, and I signed up for the free trial and forgot to cancel it before it charged me. I had planned to switch to a cheaper option, but forgot! I email the company and Kerry replied. He was very kind, understood my situation, and helped guide me through cancelling my payment. I plan to keep a less costly subscription for this app, just because the Creator was so kind!
As for the usability of the app, I found it very helpful with planning hikes and for navigation. I can tell the Creator put a lot of thought into creating this app. 5 stars!!! | The free NPS app has very similar content on a much easier to use platform‚Ä¶ and did I mention free? 

The adds for this app were deceiving to make it seem like these guides were free, or at least affordable. But $19.99 per month to access park travel guides, which is what is advertised, is very overpriced. Based on other subscribers‚Äô reviews of the paid content, I‚Äôll pass. Without the $19.99/month subscription, the app offers little to no functionality and is not worth the used space on your phone! Do yourselves a favor and download the NPS app. 

I‚Äôll also add that the developers‚Äô response to some of these reviews and the active deception and hiding of their fees makes me question the morality of the developer‚Ä¶ yet another reason why I‚Äôm not willing to risk $19.99 to give the paid version a shot. I hope you will also think twice before paying the developer! | Paid for the subscription. Verified that I‚Äôm subscribed but it freezes every time that I try to download the map for offline usage and then prompts me to ‚Äústart 3 day trial‚Äù and then just repeats that I‚Äôm already subscribed. Shame. | I got excited after reading Nikon‚Äôs photography challenge. However, when I downloaded the app, they wanted $19.99/month! I do not go to enough parks for that kind of money. It was a little less for 3 months, but still an expensive regular fee. I‚Äôm not asking for anything for free, but this was too much for my budget. Best of luck to them. It looks like it would be a cool way to track park experiences. | The free NPS app has the same content, including links to nearby parks/monuments/trails without adding extra unnecessary information. You can also save the NPS parks for offline use. I mean, if you‚Äôd like to waste at least $19.99 per month, this is an option, I guess. EDIT: The developer responded, saying I‚Äôm putting out misinformation‚Ä¶that the PARK TRAVEL GUIDE app only costs money if you want to access PARK TRAVEL GUIDES. So, thank you Chimani for verifying what I wrote. You DO charge a minimum of $19.99/mo to use the primary functions of your app. LOL EDIT 2: Chimani removed their comment about ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù and changed their claims YET AGAIN. I don‚Äôt trust a developer who keeps moving the goalposts and using doublespeak to hide their fees. | Very useful,with interesting content | The ‚Äúupdated‚Äù version completely changed all the features that made this a fantastic app and now it‚Äôs almost useless.  The previous map was great: you could sort by type of national park property (or just view them all) and easily see visited vs. unvisited sites. Yes, I‚Äôve had communications as to how I‚Äôm supposed to still be able to do something similar, but let‚Äôs be honest, it doesn‚Äôt come even close to the functionality of the previous version. Oh so sad. I seldom use the app anymore. | Was using this app for nearly 4 years and visited majority of the US while traveling for work. Perfect features for visiting monuments, preserves to National Parks. Absolutely loved this app. 

Once the new upgrade happened, it‚Äôs simple features became a hinderance. Factoring in the pay feature, they had a great system going till they messed it up. 

Hard to imagine messing up a mayonnaise sandwich but I guess anything is possible. | The information provided by this app is generic and not very helpful for selecting somewhere to visit and figuring out what to do there. I think you are better off visiting nps.gov and the many excellent travel blogs for actual useful information. There are more specialized apps that are much more useful for hiking. There is something cheap and tawdry about the app‚Äôs gamification of visiting national parks, as well as the ads appearing on most screens.

UPDATE: I did look at the guides and they are hard to use. Typically, you have a map with many points but few labels, so it‚Äôs hard to know or remember what you are looking at. You can also see lists of hikes, waterfalls, et cetera, but there‚Äôs no way to put together a coherent picture or plan. Information can be out of date, e.g., the Grove of the Patriarchs at Mt. Ranier is closed with no re-opening date. | If I want to record a past visit you can‚Äôt record multiple days at once with drag and drop‚Ä¶would be much easier if you could. | Why did you screw up the map?  I liked to be able to easily see which parks I had been to in an area.  Bring that back!!! | Just like ALL the recent reviews I‚Äôm so upset they ruined one of the Best apps for national Parks.  This app helped us visit 46 national Parks and now it‚Äôs trash. It completely wiped all the tracking we had in place. The map to find parks near you is gone and now they show way to much on the maps so you can‚Äôt actually find the 63 NPs.  

I can‚Äôt understand why they would take something so good and put out this crap.  Look at your user reviews since the update they are all 1 star. 

Bring back the original app!!! | This was the absolute best app for tracking National Parks / Monuments etc. Then the changed the mapping data and its a giant steaming pile of hot garbage now. Sad, I really loved this app. | I am not happy at all with the new version, I will never use guides , you took away the map of the US showing each park and the ones I have already visited a different color. You would simply click on the park and would get a description and another click would take you directly to the National Park page, I wished you would change this app back , I cannot see using this app anymore | Every time I click on Utah it goes to West Virginia. I kinda have an idea of what‚Äôs in the state, but I would also like to see what‚Äôs there and see the info of what‚Äôs in the state for any park weather it state  or National. | For years this has been my go-to national park app. I even bought the lifetime subscription. Ever since the last update to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù their app it‚Äôs straight garbage. Please roll back to the old version until you find developers that can actually build a good UI. The current version isn‚Äôt even a beta version. Please fix this or honestly I‚Äôd like a refund on my subscription. Back to the NPS app for me. | I signed up for the app to get the discounts but there is no information on the app about how to use them. I think the discounts are on the web interface but sometimes they say to use a ‚Äúpromo code‚Äù to get them and then other times mention a ‚ÄúChimani perks card‚Äù which I never received. Anyone know this? | I have been using this app since it was started and now ‚Ä¶ ugh. What happened to the maps? I used to be able to hike in a park, open the map and see where I was. I have told so many lost hikers about this app, but now I can‚Äôt even find the map. What happened?? | Really dissatisfied with the recent update. Previously it was great to be able to see what Parks you‚Äôd visited by type on one of the many map layers that you could select from. | This app makes it impossible to unsubscribe. | No idea how to reach you; tried app support with no luck.   I have been an extremely heavy user of chimani for several years‚Ä¶and loved it.   Now, I neeed to go through multiple steps to load the map‚Ä¶and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to display all the park sites without you grouping them‚Ä¶again, anotherstep I have to go through.  Please, can I have my old simple app back? | Why would you take what was a good app, and turn it into this?!?!  The new map is horrible and the app is much worse now in general | My favorite part of the original app was the way I could sort categories on a map.  I could see what is in the area while I was traveling.  It would also change the graphic colors on parks I have visited on the maps.  This version requires me to know the name of a park before I look up the information.  I hate this new version.  I have been to 50 national Parks & they only appear on a list.  Even worse the update no longer recognizes I paid for the guides. | Every time I switch to my Google Notes app to look up the date I visited a park, this app forces me to log back in and go through the process of finding the park that I was updating. So frustrating! | I‚Äôve been using this app since it started and love it! I track all of my trips and have recorded my past trips, and the guides are helpful. | And the stamp locations? | I tried to find out terms of use for renewals, etc, but the app makes this simple function impossible. Still trying to find this basic user info page after 20 mins. I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúauto-renew‚Äù as I only plan to use this app for a certain trip in 2021. So... this app lost cred with me right away. | I‚Äôve had Chimani for years and bought a lifetime membership in 2018. Their customer service is outstanding!  Kerry has helped me with a complicated subscription issue and worked everything out for me. I now have one account with all my info. Can‚Äôt wait to use it on our big upcoming trip! | I recently started using the Chimani National Park app and I love it! Very helpful information and a great tool for planning trips to parks we want to visit. Wish I had known about this app years ago. Can‚Äôt wait for more state parks to be added. | I paid 29.99 and didn‚Äôt get anything???? What a waste of money, I want Apple to refund my $$ for this app purchase!! | It‚Äôs a sad  you are forcing people to a subscription model. I Bought the Smoky mountain app and now it will not be supported anymore. | Trails are only visible when zoomed in so far one cannot get the big picture. 
Also it would be nice to be able to highlight individual trails since otherwise it is hard to see which trail is which when there are many intersections | Why doesn‚Äôt the app show the gateway arch or Indiana Dunes as national parks yet? | I use tons of apps, but rarely do reviews, but, with such exemplary support, I have to do this review. 
There was a small problem with my account, caused by me, and they happily rectified it lightning quick. 
I love supporting worthy developers. Thanks! | It might be a good app if you spend the $30 a year subscription, but the free app is worthless.

I wish that in the description the App developer was clear about the subscription costs.  Many apps have a free version that has some things, but this free version is useless

The information you get is absolutely not worth the price of this subscription. All of it you could easily get online or from the literature at the entrance gate of national parks. | Wouldn't store park info before. Now they charge a ridiculous fee for info that can be had for free from other sources. I have deleted this app. | There is absolutely no redeeming feature of this app. The parks themselves provide better and more insight than this ripoff. They stole $30 from me, DO NOT let this happen to you! A complete waste of storage space. | Not free at all.  Will not let you try it out unless you have either sufficient funds on apple store for full year or credit card  on file with apple | I‚Äôve been using this app for many years and find it incredibly useful!  There are a few little things that have been identified in other reviews, so I‚Äôm not going to repeat them.  This app is well worth having and using if you frequent the National Parks - especially if you hike into the parks, beyond the parking lots and congestion.  I spend a lot of time on remote trails, and some not so remote.  There have been several times this app helped me find my way back after a long day on a confusing trail system. I always carry a paper map (as a backup), but there‚Äôs nothing like being able to view your location on a downloaded map of the trail system!  Btw, I even carry a small solar panel to charge my phone.
As with most apps, you MUST use it and familiarize yourself with it to fully benefit from its many features. | This app is great for planning national park trips! I‚Äôve used it on my last five and it always gives great tips and ideas. Download it! | I would pay a small fee but I don‚Äôt want the hassle of. Setting up a subscription and canceling etc. just make it an in app purchase and be done with it | best app for traveling to canyons. | The app work fine on my android phone, but I am unable to download Park guides on the iPad app. | This used to be a free 5 star app. Then they changed their model to a rather expensive pay-for basis. In the meantime I have loaded years of info covering some 37 National Parks and I am now locked out of that data because they now insist I pay a fee to look at MY DATA!

I‚Äôm pretty angry. Not because they need to charge money for what is a pretty good app but they didn't give me chance to get my data or give me free access to the parks I‚Äôd already been to (and provided them info on). My data made this app better but I‚Äôm locked out of it. So when did I go to the Talus Cave at Pinnacles NP, or hike Wheeler Peak at Great Basin? | This app is not user friendly. I paid for the year and I can‚Äôt figure out the trip planning. I downloaded the minimal map and the other one that was supposed to be more detailed, they were the same. This app is a waste of money. | Why on earth would I pay a subscription for what is essentially a database of National Park brochures. I can download these for free on the internet. | Because I had used the free version of the app to plan our park visits, it was easy to decide to pay for the lifetime membership.  The features I like most are the descriptions with photos and maps for hiking.  The app also allows you to easily keep track of parks you have visited - nice if all of the National Parks are on a bucket list.  Customer support is very responsive. | The app was a tremendous assistance while we toured Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.  Real time downloaded info and location identification made our park visits more enjoyable and less work than would have been possible with hard copy maps.  Great purchase.

The fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you‚Äôre going to San Francisco we‚Äôll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).

This is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you‚Äôve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at¬†http://skiplagged.com/faq

We‚Äôll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ad/af/0a/adaf0ab2-305a-3888-781a-4c3499353082/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-10-0-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel""]","[""6003""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN"",""FR"",""PL"",""PT"",""ZH"",""ES""]","81437696","11.0","2014-02-25T02:15:26Z","2024-01-29T15:05:16Z","This update includes bug fixes and performance improvements.

I am blown away!!! I will be flying away more often. Thank you Skiplagged!!! | Makes it so easy and best prices. Thx. | Easy fast now too relax Thank U | I haven‚Äôt told any of my friends about this website because I am worried that if more people use it the price will go up. Love this app! | Hice una reserva y al d√≠a siguiente lo intent√© cancelar xq al reservarlo me descontaron inmediatamente y no me hicieron reembolso la pero aplicaci√≥n que hay | I‚Äôm new to the app I‚Äôve always paid full price from American for my flights ! With money being a little more tight I decided to expand my horizons and fly whatever was the cheapest haha. My friend referred me to this app and I‚Äôm so in love and I‚Äôm telling everyone haha ü§£ I‚Äôve been missing all the good deals for too long ! I‚Äôm trying more budget friendly practices and this is my new go to for flights ! | This is and has been one of the best sites for travel all around the world! The prices and features are great! | I heard great things about this app, I booked 2 separate flights through them and I was charged 40$ from Skiplagged which I‚Äôm not understanding why | I always get very good prices when I book with Skip-lagged. | Love it!! It's easy to use and super fast! | So I used this for the first time and however the company made my reservation landed me with 8 reservations which was a red flag. From there I was told the flag was for fraud. I was told that if I do not continue to the final destination I will be black listed from the airline. It just isn‚Äôt worth it save yourselves. | This is a great site to book a quick flight for cheap price. I will review it again once my son takes his flight. | Useless | If you can travel light & not check bags, this is a legitimate service that Skiplagged provides that will routinely save you money, especially if you‚Äôre willing to #1 travel light, #2 book a couple weeks in advance, #3 not be the type of person that has change your flight multiple times before you actually go. | The unexpected charges upon arrival at the hotel we booked were ridiculous and were not made known to us before arrival. We were told we should‚Äôve booked directly through the hotel instead of a third party (Skiplagged), and we would‚Äôve been made aware of the additional charges. Why allow booking through third parties to begin with if that‚Äôs the case? Why would Skiplag not inform customers? | I have found myself using Skiplagged for years now and saving thousands of dollars on flights. I love that you can find the best deals with the best airlines. I highly recommend to anyone who travels on a budget. | I was in Bratislava, Slovakia and skipedlag got me home to jfk on short notice for 600usd. This is definitely the travelers app to consult | So easy to navigate the site for the best days to book flight for the best rates! | Why was i charged $10 after. | Is this app intended for traveling mice?  Why are the origin and Destination on the top of the search SO FREAKING SMALL??? | This site keeps me on top. | Been using it for years and have had no regrets- even wasting travel credits towards a free flight. | I was given a $10 and was not allowed to use it and was no option to add it at checkout. What‚Äôs up with the false advertising? | It‚Äôs my first time using this App, hope everything will be fine. Many thanks for creators. | I‚Äôm excited to have booked a flight for my nieces 9th birthday, with nonstop to and from; i have anxiety and couldn‚Äôt fathom a layover flight but my brother in law sent me this link and now I'm ready to pack; thanks Skiplagged. | You have a great prices at the right time | I would like this app to give me the option to filter-out flights on certain airplanes. I do not have confidence in Boeing, so it is important to me to be able to easily filter-out Boeing flights. | Skiplagged has saved me at least $1000 in the span of one year. Absolutely changed my life. It‚Äôs a Swiss Army knife for digital nomads. | This App is good for window shopping specifically to see the graphs for pricing. Never make a mistake of purchasing through this App. I booked for SJC to DFW, the ticket after the purchase is for SJC to LGA with a stop over in DFW. When reached out to then they said it‚Äôs called hidden city booking and I should have seen that in the terms or whatever. The problem is I can‚Äôt check in bags because of wrong destination and can‚Äôt cancel the ticket either as there is no refund. | Love frontier thanks for letting me book everytime | Skiplagged is epic for flight and hotel specials. I want take some time to say thank you to the creators of this app and bless you for your works. I saved lots time with this app | This is the best App I have ever used. Thank you! | Best travel site ever! Thank you | As a frequent flyer I am always looking for the best flights. Skiplagged is always the first app I open when booking flights. Such an easy to use app and very great valued ticket prices. I would recommend Skiplagged to anyone flying. | Was charged 9.99 without explanation!!!!! What is this charge for? | WHY BUY PROTECTION ON A FLIGHT IF YOU NEVER REFUND THE MONEY! | The cost of flights have increased since the pandemic.  Skiplagged offers great deals at great prices! | Very grateful to have this booking service!
Many options & great pricing! | The only app I use for booking | This used to be one of my favorite apps, but the latest update isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbug fixes and enhancements‚Äù; it‚Äôs forcing users to permit additional data collection and tracking. There is no option to opt out of this.  There is only the option to press ‚Äúcontinue.‚Äù  I do not want additional tracking, even if they claim they won‚Äôt sell my data.   I have serious concerns about privacy as well as price manipulation (a strategy used by some airline websites, using cookies and similar tools to show higher fares to users who have previously searched for that flight).   Even if Skiplagged isn‚Äôt doing this, I find the forced additional tracking to be extremely disrespectful to users who value privacy and autonomy.   I regret updating the app and wish I could revert to the old version. | Skiplagged charged MORE then the actual cost of the flight. This is not counting the service fee or additional protections I purchased which I am already being refunded for. Now, the issue.

The price of my flight alone and the flight cost listed by the airline have an $86.04 dollar difference. I am currently in talks with them to see where the extra money went on their end. It was canceled same day so I am supposed to get a full refund. Depending on how the issue is resolved, I will update my review. But why is there a difference in the first place? | It‚Äôs not always the cheapest, but most of the time & usually I can find a great deal, even on last minute flights. | So janky. The user interface is embarrassingly elementary. Don‚Äôt give them your info, it‚Äôll be compromised! | Excellent !!! | Great way to get away last minute | Do not book with this app unless you will be put on the no fly list for fraud unfortunately they don‚Äôt tell you this!! | Love this app | Thank you for such a great platform to conveniently get a to. Of information and ways how to save you a ton of money on the same trip.

I‚Äôm trying to compare to Tripcoin and the first thing I do is go to enter my first receipt and you have to pay. You would be smart to allow full access for a few days. | I understand not being able to edit more than one trip at a time, but it won‚Äôt even tell you how much you spent on prior trips unless you have premium - it just deletes the data.

Made it pretty unusable for a multi country SE asia trip unless you edit it to all be one trip, and then the data is totally muddled and useless. | Thank you for all the work on this app. I love it! This is exactly what I was looking for. The ability to track all the expenses of a trip from valet tips to coffee to hotels. It works for driving or flying. I cannot say it enough, I love it. | easy to mange and cute emoticons really like that it calculates a lot of stuff for you! | Love this app - I‚Äôve always wanted to track our Trip expenses but somehow after several days the notebook loses its luster - but this works! Thanks for this easy and user friendly solution! | During our planning for a 3 month European adventure we realized that we would need to find a way to record expenses during the trip. We looked in the App Store and came across this App. We downloaded it and immediately started recording the expenses that we had already incurred. We then started recording those expenses that we had not yet incurred but planned (reservations). It was then, on the first day, we realized we had found that tool. We immediately upgraded to the premium lifetime version. 

That was over 3 months ago. We have returned from that trip. Every day, wherever we were, we EASILY entered every transaction creating thorough and comprehensive history of expenses. After we returned we exported the data into a spreadsheet, formatted the data and proceeded to reconcile all our credit card accounts as well as enter the data in Quicken (our household finance management tool). A task that we originally dreaded. The process while not easy was absolutely made easier with the use of this App. During the process, we were able to go back into the App and confirm receipts that we could not even remember what they were by piecing together info we easily recorded in real time months before. The App‚Äôs functionalities to convert multiple currencies and geo locate transactions are invaluable! 

We are pleased that we have a lifetime subscription since we will never travel with out it. Actually, we are constant travelers and already have three other major in the planning stages. We now build trips before we go with all the reservations. We will also use it for short trips. 

While it is exceptional just the way it is now, in the spirt of feedback here is a suggestion. Create a ‚Äúnote field‚Äù to record some general related info that the user may believe is relevant to the transaction. This would be different from the current ‚Äúnote‚Äù field that really functions more like a transaction title field that I believe could be retitled. 

In summary, if you‚Äôre looking for an easy to use but robust expense tracking App, you found a very good one! | We have been traveling for few months and we use the app to keep track of our budget every day since the beginning of our journey. It‚Äô s really well done and simple and intuitive. I recommended it for any one who like to travel like us. In addition the new version is nice upgrade. | We are full time travelers and so I use this app every day. It‚Äôs an excellent app, but I would appreciate being able to see a month view to track spending on a monthly basis in addition to by the trip. I‚Äôd also like the app to keep track of how many days long each trip is. I‚Äôd also like to be able to put in a daily budget and have the app calculate the budget for the trip based on the length of the trip I enter. Thanks! | It‚Äôs absolutely perfect for traveling, gives you your average daily spend. Let‚Äôs you know how much you have left, everything about it‚Äôs great. I even use it now as a college student to do simple budgeting for my daily life | User of paid for 4+ Years. I rarely write reviews.
TravelSpend App meets all my requirements for tracking multi currency travel expenses.
App can be used as simply or comprehensively  as user decides. 
Got immediate practical support from developer today. Thank you- and wish Prosperity again in 2023. | I actually enjoy tracking my expenses with this app! Love how I can split a cost into however many months needed, and that it converts to my home currency. | Downloaded the trial to test it out and input my travel expenses and all my data disappeared without any warning. Unless you want to pay $30+, don‚Äôt bother downloading. | Thank you so much for all of your time and effort creating this application! It has almost every feature you can think of and it is truly an amazing product!! 

Please consider adding the feature for a quick add in regards to expenses. Sometimes while on the go, you just want to add the amount and the title really quickly so you don‚Äôt forget about it later. Then when you have more time go back and put in all the details. I was checking out similar applications and you can check out the feature in Trip Coins app. They‚Äôre lacking several features you have, but they do have the quick add feature. I would recommend adding this to your 2.0 version. 
Also, it looks like they are one of your top competitors. One of the main differences is that their application is free, and yours requires a monthly subscription. I don‚Äôt mind paying, but to attract more customers you might want to think about a promotion or lowering your prices initially. 

Thanks again for creating a great application! Hope to see the quick add in the near future!! | Well thought out travel expenses tracking. Just enough features, without bloat. The team is responsive to suggestions. | I rarely say that about apps. We use this for all of our trips. | I‚Äôve tracked expenses in excel on backpacking trips before and it worked fine, but once I discovered this app, I knew I was never going back. It‚Äôs super easy to quickly jot down any expense right as I do the transaction. And the reporting it pretty neat too.

It crashes one second after opening üòû please fix.

Thank you for fixing it. Like I said before, awesome app. | This app is good! I used it on my honeymoon and it helped us stay on budget. 

My husband and I are moving overseas on an annual budget. I inputted our monthly income into various income categories for one month and thought that I could just duplicate it quickly, but found out that I can‚Äôt. That means I‚Äôll have to manually enter each income category‚Ä¶this is a dealbreaker unfortunately‚Ä¶

Please add this feature :( | There doesn‚Äôt appear to be a spot to record mileage. I emailed customer service but never got a reply???? | This is the best expense tracker I‚Äôve ever used. Once I set up the categories I needed, it‚Äôs been very easy for me to enter things daily. It‚Äôs really helped me keep track of what I am spending and what choices I have. | I gave this a try way back in 2017 for our trips and I loved the ease of use. I bought the app for a longer trip out of the country and was blown away by how easy it was to record all of my purchases in a different currency and have it presented to me in my home currency. Furthermore, the visuals and way information was presented made it super easy to understand where we stood in terms of our travel budget. 

Big kudos to the support through the app as well. Recently we migrated to iOS and the team helped us out immediately with our purchase from Android üéâüéâ | This is the best app I've found for tracking my expenses while backpacking and traveling around. Easy to use and nice charts of what you're spending money on. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a travel budgeting app. | This is all u need it. Perfect app for traveling on a budget, or if you like to have things organized. I love it! No words to describe how much it has helped me. I would give it a 10 stars if possible. | The best travel app available.  Job well done!   Worth the money! | Used this on a recent trip with my wife. It was perfect for keeping track of our travel expenses. Will definitely continue to use and recommend. | Love this app! I‚Äôve tried trial wallet & it roil always crash & never save anything and that‚Äôs about what the others did as well. So glad I found this app and tried it out. This app is amazing do far. It has how much spent and remaining and it doesn‚Äôt reset or crash like the others. This is eat I‚Äôve been looking for. Only travel twice a year so have the free version. üòÅ | Purchased the pro version and when adding expenses to any trip the app just completely shuts down every time. Trail Wallet is a much better app and 100% free with no ads. Wasted my money, don‚Äôt waste yours on this. | Entering data is easy, not as cumbersome as I had anticipated.

I think it may be the best airline app in my phone, and I‚Äôve got them all. | been flying with Jet Blue because service is good. | Pretty effective app | Everything departing from Sfo to Fll very smooth. Departing from FLL horrible. I knew as a tvl coordinator were allowed one carry on 45 inches plus a back pack and your purse. This was not applied and made it difficult managing my handheld personal items, very embarrassing. Once we passed through security I kept seeing many passengers with backpack, carry on 45 inches plus shopping bags. Not fair. Please stay true. Harassment unnecessary. | Yay | I always check Jet Blue before making any trip plans.  As a 6‚Äù4‚Äù high traveler the extra legroom is priceless at standard fares.
Staff are always courteous .
It‚Äôs my Go-To Airline.
Always look for their email specials. | This app makes tracking your flight so much easier! | En mi vuelo de regreso no me est√° dejando agregar maleta extra. | The app doesn‚Äôt not let you log out of your account.  When booking travel for a family, one sometimes need to switch between accounts. I have tried deleting the app, erasing cookies, deleting and shutting down the phone then reinstalling, turning off cookies, and I spent over an hour with tech support for the app. This could be easily solved if the ‚Äúlog out‚Äù button in the app actually worked.  The tech team needs to fix this before we can travel with Jet Blue again. | Easy clear app on a quality carrier.   Refreshingly simple to search and book flights. | Flight was good but OMG waiting for my bags TERRIBLE üò°üò° unacceptable | My original flight was cancelled so I re booked a day and a half later 
Resulting in our missing part of a event 
Also when I rescheduled I had to pay the larger seat rate again 
I haven‚Äôt seen a credit for the original cost 
I would also expect a couple of 1/2 price flights to Orlando or something to compensate us for our troubles , re- scheduling , hotel adjustment , car rental adjustment 

And upset little granddaughters 

We have flown blue multiple times. | Half of the screens just load their website. App is underdeveloped and buggy. Constant errors. | There are several key functionalities missing in the app:
No way to PERMANENTLY add additional companions for future flight. Forced to input same person each time the flight is booked. 
Passport information on file (even for main traveler) does not get populated for check in. Need to re-input. Very annoying. | Delays: A March 19, I was in the flight #B6 2134 that had a delay of 7 hours and I didn‚Äôt received the $150 reimbursement.  It is not correct, because other passengers received it.  Please proceed with this reimbursement.  
From : Mayda Caban Rodr√≠guez | 0 stars. Total garbage. | Been flying them for years and always impressed. | This is not a true app. The user experience does start with the appearance of a true integrated app, but when you select any option it merely opens a mobile web browser inside the app to work within. Load times are long and it‚Äôs hard to find information (like how many checked bags and carryons are allowed with your fare). It is ultimately an app that fronts for a slow mobile web browser. I‚Äôve also yet to find a way to log out of the app, as I‚Äôve selected the various menu options and have yet to find the option to do so. | Been flying JetBlue for years now and won‚Äôt fly another unless JetBlue don‚Äôt go there but they go everywhere we wanna go.   Flying Mosaic is a plus. Haven‚Äôt had a bad flight.  Customer service is very accommodating and the flight crew are always kinda and prepared. | Keep up the good work | This app is trash. No matter what dates you choose, you get the same results that no flights are available. And yet at the very bottom lower right, it reads that you can book through 2025. Make it make sense. | Amo Jet Blue excelente servicio al cliente. Asientos c√≥modos, puntuales. √âXITO | Excelencia. Servicio, buen recurso humano cortes√≠a,  responsabilidad, snack buenos, asientos confortables , entrenamiento to variado  y amabilidad | Even when the tv doesn‚Äôt work and there is a tiny delay JetBlue is still the number one choice for all our air travel. | User friendly and accurate. | Staying on top is hard but, from ‚Äúnever‚Äù problems to almost always! And the negative PR is bad‚Ä¶ | Got bounced from my seat, and JetBlue tried to get me to pay to be assigned a new seat. Serious consumer fraud and a ‚Äúbait and switch‚Äù. I am yet again reminded why I am loyal to other airlines. | When I use it today, this App does not use my Face ID and keep giving me ‚Äúincorrect email and/or password.‚Äù When I clicked ‚Äúreset password ‚Äú, a dialogue appeared. But it disappeared before I could type anything. How can such a buggy update to be released??? | Wonder app from JetBlue | I thought this was going to help me but it didn‚Äôt I was looking for a plan ticket to El Paso TX and apparently they don‚Äôt have it in the search bar | First time in 18 years, traveling to my country of birth what a comfortable flight friendly flight attendance, a wonderful experience.
        Thank you, | Used these guys twice.Both times the had major flight causing us to miss appointments.Going back to Delta | The app is ok for this however, no option exists that I could find for ‚Äúflexible dates‚Äù | JetBlue flights clearly the best. On time, quality planes, capable staff. JetBlue > Delta > All the other airlines | If you have checked and paid bags during booking, you should skip bags selection during Checking In process to avoid double charges. | Easy to use..updated information | The app worked perfectly until the most recent update. Now when modifying date range it will not change them most of the times causes the app to crash | I really like the app.  The only think that I wish would work is the iCal calendar.  It hasn‚Äôt worked for awhile.  The Google one works, but I have an Apple.  Please fix it that it will open | If you decide to fly JetBlue, buy your tickets on a computer browser. I bought plane tickets this morning over the app and it didn‚Äôt go through so I tried it again and it told me there was an issue with my banking institution, which was wrong. It ended up going through and it charged me, but I never got a confirmation email so I had to call JetBlue and their customer service is terrible. the customer service representative told me that the charges for my checked bag and reserved seat didn‚Äôt go through even though it charged my bank the full amount. She told me I would have to give her my card information over the phone so that I could buy the checked bag and the reserved seat. I did all of this and then she told me I would just be buying the checked bag and reserved seat, but then she charged my card all over again for the full amount of the ticket, bag, and seat. I didn‚Äôt notice this till later, so I had to call them again and they said that I should just be getting a refund in seven business days, but the first lady never told me this. This has been the longest day of my life, I will be needing therapy after. | Please have the decency to had a summary feature of the trip before I pay. I had to start over because I couldn‚Äôt see the date and time. | I was flying to Las Vegas and got a terrible stomach virus in the middle of the flight. I passed out, I got sick everywhere, and was sick for the remainder of the flight. The flight attendants were kind and understanding and very helpful. It was still a really bad situation, but with their help I was able to make it through the flight. I will be forever grateful | Good | This app makes my life easier very grateful to have it at my fingertips | Last JetBlue flight from LAX via a JetBlue connection departed 15min early, stranding about 35 passengers in LAX till 3:30AM. That was about a year ago and I decided to try it again due to a scheduling constraint. Boy was that a huge mistake. I board the plane early, and having PAID for a carryon bag, tried to put my bag in the overhead, only to be refused by the flight attendant, because my bag was small. Meanwhile, gate agents let everyone board with their oversized carryon roller bags. Flight attendant was the stereotypical passive aggressive troll we all see in the movies. Then got to sit on the tarmac for an hour while JetBlue had some scheduling system error. This airline line deserves to be bankrupt, I hope the acquisitions are blocked so some new competition can get into this market. | JB needs to increase the flight options with all the partnerships that it has and let the clients use their points. | Terrible customer service terrible airline.

It would be a 5 star if it didn't take a lot of time. And the adds should maybe only be 15 seconds instead half a minute. Other than those, very good app and I would recommend it. | Just please more options for vehicles that‚Äôs not enough | Enjoy the app. It‚Äôs a fun idea. The graphics are good and the using of Apple Maps is cool. I love making videos for friends as I am a truck driver and like to show people my trips.

I do wish, however there was a way for the route to be automatically created. Perhaps using the Apple Maps directions, it can generate a route. The route would be able to be edited afterwards. 

As it stands, you have to edit the route and drop a million pins, which makes it a bit of a hassle. | Where is the feature to make your own map like on YouTube and stuff they make their own map and I need to know how to do that please it would be so nice if u could reply | Yay | Don‚Äôt make a mistake as you can‚Äôt delete a step. You have to delete the entire route and start again. | I love the game and the way it is. Is amazing | I would give this app 5 stars, however it is missing two KEY FEATURES.

	1. Desperately needs LANDSCAPE view added.  The app only allows portrait mode, so if you are using a iPad on a keyboard you are up the creek with no paddle. 

	2. Please add trip destination list.  Currently you add a destination then must add a new destination.  The old destination becomes a waypoint along your journey.  This is ok until you want to add text or edit the route.

If these two features were added I am advocate until then no. | This app will fail immediately when you get it. I should clarify: it will let you build out a whole year of travel and then if you want to see it animate, it will crash each time you click to play or view it. Worried about it and want to save it just in case before you troubleshoot the horrible app? Too bad, saving a single route will cost you $29.99 - no joke. Stay away. | First when you download this app you have too write the place you 
Want to go. But please let us just look on the map and choose please. And you get a dame tutorial and please you have to buy a vehicle and you have real money.

Like I said Don‚Äôt Download This App. | ITS TOO GOOD | Es incre√≠ble y puedo saber los viajes | App not working fix it | It just glitched when I‚Äôm making a car going every thing from Denmark to Denmark | Highly recommend | Quick and easy, love the app | Such a cool idea for this app.  But when I try to use it on my iPad it only operates in Portrait mode.  I‚Äôd venture to say the majority of iPad users ‚Äúwork‚Äù on their iPads in Landscape.  Can‚Äôt you make this orient properly based on the device and orientation of the device? | I love this group well really a dark mode | Gud | Aplicaci√≥n muy divertida para dibujar recorridos !!! | Route management is awful: no clue which route you‚Äôre exiting, if it‚Äôs saved etc. 

No undoing you accidentally double tap instead of press and hold. | I love this app thank you! | This is VERY GOOD with Border, Even better than Mapchart, Even the Mongol Empire Makes ALOT MORE Sence because on Mapchart it has sharp ends, but I like it when it has soft ends, and it makes it look a lot more like Mongol Empire! | This is the BEST app ever for mac, Especially if you have the premium. 5 Stars. Period. No Excuses. | It‚Äôs simple but something as easy as touching a line might mess up the map. So then you have to take time to delete the stuff every time you accidentally create a pin. Also i have a hard time changing the icon if I go over the same destination twice. After restarting 3 times, I just gave up because it ended up looking messy. Frustrating to try to use overall. It makes more sense to me that instead of being able to add a location just by accidentally touching the line, there should be a plus symbol if someone wants to adjust the line (along with the regular one at the top right). | Can't get past the tutorial screen | Hi I like this game but there are problems that I frustrated .So when making routes there are random routes just popping up that is not supposed to be like that and I worked hard on those routes to make videos but I had to delete a lot and none of them were successful and I cannot post them because the routes and tangled and messed up Please fix it. I‚Äôm gonna leave one star review if this keeps happening. Thank you. | This is good for making TikToks and yt shorts | Necesita otra figura de mu√±ecos mam√° -pap√° -hijo - hija

  Gracias | This will be good to travel to new places stay excited! | I see it on tik tok and yt shorts and it looks like amazing content. I wish the could make it easier for boarders and stuff but other than that it is pretty good! 

Smiley face of appreciation :) | Hi | I love geography so much and when I discovered this app I sharted my pants IM ACTUALLY GOING INSANE I LOVE THIS SO MUCH IM ACTUALLY GOING TO BASH MY SKULL INTO CONCRETE AND SCOOP MY EYES OUT WITH SPOONS | It claims to give you a free download of your video if you watch an ad and after your 30 seconds ad it does not close out but rather only lets you download another app and you have to retry hence watching another ad and it cycles again. | This game is SO fun. I make good content with tysm | I can make empires with this helpful and playful game!! It‚Äôs so fun | Good app | this is so fun i can make my own videos qnd stuff it is amazing!!! | after a while of making stops at different places a bunch of the yellow lines start appearing and everything just glitches i‚Äôve tried many things but it won‚Äôt work | Lul | I don‚Äôt wanna make anyone sad :C | People made videos with this | Hi! I love this app and use it all the time. I just updated to the new version and it looks like the old default map has changed and also it doesn‚Äôt animate the same. Wondering how I can step back to the previous version? I really loved the way it animated before and the old map.

Thank you Cheap Flights!
? | I used to love Cheap Flights, I would used it always. It was great to be able to choose a whole month, select everywhere and be able to see the best prices and destinations to choose from. Now is more about deal packages and more difficult to select countries according to best price. Sometimes updates and ""improvementes"" simply destroy the expierence. | Got a super cheap deal within a day of downloading. Think this is a game changer for traveling | Don't book anything without looking through this app first. | Saving the time in excellent way. | Its the best way to look for flights. | Loving the great cheap prices!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è | Even if I can never really afford to go where I want, this seems to be the best app to find decent prices with | Really like all the options and ease of use. | I have been using the application for a few days now and I have seen great value! I would highly recommend it to anyone who is constantly on the go and looking to get an up-to date information about airline fares! ? | Makes finding affordable airfare quick and easy. | Last Minute has saved me lots of frustration and $ by finding flights and airlines when I was in great need of getting where I needed to go. | The easiest way to find any flight is by using Last Minute | Very hand and easy. I wish they would add more to the anywhere option though. | Bait and switch!!!!!  I needed to get business class tickets. I selected business class for my search. The prices seemed pretty good for business class compared to when I search the airlines directly. I decided to book. The booking took me to a website called eBooking. I double checked the dates, times, and airports were all correct and filled in all passenger‚Äôs info. Paid for the flights and the confirmation showed all tickets were economy seats!!! I called the 800# for the 24 hour help line, no one ever answered. I immediately froze my credit card to keep the charge from going through.

Watch out if you use this app!!! | Be careful I purchased a flight and got a call an hour later that the price doubled. I couldn‚Äôt pay the extra amount so they canceled my booking but still charged me the original price. I‚Äôll be fighting it with the bank to remove it but I may be stuck paying it. Stick to Priceline or direct from airline from now on when I purchase from them they honor their price | Will show one price and then they will call you with a different price and threaten to not cancel? That‚Äôs crazy. I have used this before without an issue but being scammed once is enough for me. Fix the issue Last Minute. This is borderline illegal if not illegal already. Not sure how deep this scam goes. | Worst place to book tickets ever I booked a flight to Nebraska for two and a lady called me and said the flight was fully booked and we would have to pay a extra 100 to upgrade and when we said no she transferred  our flight to a different airport on different dates and when I asked why cancelled and hung up terrible customer derived | Scam does not let you book | I‚Äôve been trying to book this flight for an hour but the ads keep interrupting the process and making me start over. Horrible experience and a waste of time. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. | They offer you a good price and then they call you with the story that the price was a mistake, then they offer you an incredibly high price and then they threaten you that if you don't pay that price they can't cancel the reservation. If you do not have the product you offer available, do not try to threaten the client, you may find yourself in legal trouble. | Please, be very careful with this site . They conecto you to fraudulent sites  that will take your money and never issue your tickets. We just lost more than 3k in tickets with the Travelmakers.us .
They sent us a fake booking number , then they said the airline cancelled our tickets and they did refund the money . Be very careful!! Stay away! | This app is a scam. They will show you flights then say it can‚Äôt process so you have to call. When you call they‚Äôll try to get you a different flight and ask for your card number. I realized it was a scam so I hung up. Then they started texting me. It was not the normal robot texts. It was very strange! | Take farehutz off there! I use to love this app and have bought multiple tickets from here. The last 2 times I tried I got tickets and happened to be through farehutz. Both times they called and tried to scam me and say they couldn't guarantee tickets and I‚Äôd have to pay more. The lady on the phone was a jerk. This company is a scam! Take them out! | Have only browsed and not bought yet. Prices seem good but VCP airport (and maybe others) need to be added. Thanks. | This app is great, but DO NOT book through TrustFares. They are a SCAM, after I booked they changed all my flights and charged me extra and wouldn‚Äôt let me cancel. It was a complete nightmare. I wrote a negative review on Google and they called me 3 times a day to saying they wouldn‚Äôt give me my itineraries unless I deleted my review. I had to call the airlines directly and they said TrustFares had put their contact info in place of mine so that I wouldn‚Äôt receive my tickets. SKETCHY! | 3 minutes after booking I online got a call telling me that that price was no longer available and after I wanted to cancel the booking I was advised there will be a $150 charge for that. SCAM! | They run inaccurate rates in the application and then send you emails that day your tickets are pending. Then they waste your time before jacking up the price and using pressure closing techniques to guilt application users into honoring their commitment‚Ä¶ a commitment predicated on a false price from a company that either can‚Äôt afford to invest in real-time application updates or doesn‚Äôt care to. 

Either way‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried multiple times and deal with the same headache every time. 

Run as far from this app as possible!! | I used this app for a specific date and time flight from SFO to LAS.  They offered exactly what I needed on their app.  They then switched me over to a third party provider, MyHolidays.com.  I proceeded to order and pay for the the non-refundable ticket.  When it arrived it was not the initial time they said it would be.  It was going to arrive 14 hours later than I expected.  I asked for a refund which they denied.  It was a pure case of bait and switch. | Lists super cheap flights, asks for your credit card, then when you click ""Book"" it just takes you to a terms and conditions page that's a mile long. Just a colossal waste of time | I am absolutely done with this app. If I could rate it lower or report these people I would! We‚Äôve tried booking numerous flights through them  in the past three days. Every time we do, we get a call from India telling us we have to cancel our flight, and they inform us that they have another flight available, but SIGNIFICANTLY more in cost. The first flight we booked, they called and said it was overbooked, then they got a scheduled on another flight, then called back and said that they had to cancel our tickets for that flight, the third flight they booked us on was the first flight we originally booked. That was the last straw. The guy didn‚Äôt speak english, got extremely rude and just hung up on me! I will not be using them again! | This app used to be good and reliable but recently shows scam website on cheap flight . 
Don‚Äôt book unless website refer to is highly reliable. | within seconds of inputting info and submitting for price check 2 scam centers called me to check if I was still interested and that they would like to talk on the phone üòÜ warning AVOIIIDD | üö® üö® I really do not recommend the application, I just bought a ticket for the month of August and after they charged me they sent me an email with another price, it is better to buy the ticket directly with the airline, I am waiting for the money back üí∞ and no one responds . highly dangerous ‚ö†Ô∏è book on this site. üö® üö® Realmente no recomiendo la aplicaci√≥n, acabo de comprar un boleto para el mes de agosto y despu√©s de que me cobraron me enviaron un correo electr√≥nico con otro precio, es mejor comprar el boleto directamente con la aerol√≠nea, estoy esperando el dinero Vuelve üí∞ y nadie responde. libro altamente peligroso ‚ö†Ô∏è en este sitio. üö® üö® Eu realmente n√£o recomendo o aplicativo, acabei de comprar uma passagem para o m√™s de agosto e depois que me cobraram me enviaram um e-mail com outro pre√ßo, √© melhor comprar a passagem diretamente com a companhia a√©rea, estou esperando o dinheiro de volta üí∞ e ningu√©m responde . altamente perigoso ‚ö†Ô∏è reserve neste site. üö® üö® Je ne recommande vraiment pas l'application, je viens d'acheter un billet pour le mois d'ao√ªt et apr√®s m'avoir factur√© ils m'ont envoy√© un mail avec un autre prix, il vaut mieux acheter le billet directement aupr√®s de la compagnie a√©rienne, j'attends l'argent retour üí∞ et personne ne r√©pond . livre hautement dangereux ‚ö†Ô∏è sur ce site. | Waste of time ! Use a better wesbite like Expedia!! SCAM!!! | This app offer you cheapest flight from scam websites in India, don‚Äôt waste your time here | This app is a totally scam. They request your payment and after hours you call or they will call u saying that the ticket was a promo and the offer you another tickets with difference price. Keep away from fake promotions , deals or not real information | I got 3 calls today for 3 of the flights I booked yesterday. Instead of getting my tickets finalized, I got told everything was booked and to pay an additional $200, $190, and $100 accordingly for my flights. I was told there were no more seats on in the class I bought so I had to upgrade my seat. I explained that I see seats for the same flights and times with the airlines on the airline‚Äôs website. They told me it wouldn‚Äôt work, not true! I was able to get all three flights at better prices on the airline‚Äôs website than with this app. Why not be honest about the up charge in the first place. I have asked for my money back but they‚Äôre refusing to give me a refund so I had my credit card cancel it since I got new tickets. | This app is identical with Cheapair. They advertise low air fares, you make the reservation with your personal and credit card info, then they call you to blame the airline company for overbooking. Rest assured, they can offer you a similar flight at a significantly higher rate even if there are plenty of offerings in their app at lower rates. | This app is iffy at best and will connect you to third party agencies who are essentially running scams. I‚Äôm a lawyer so I was smart enough to read the terms and conditions of my purchase but without having done so I would have been squeezed into buying a 1.2k ticket that is valued at 1k, and that I was under the intention of buying for $967 before the agency increased the price for an unconfirmed ticket. It was a long and tedious process to go through and would be just as long and tedious to explain but bottom line is DO NOT use this app. | I have no clue where these positive reviews are from, but they have to be fake. I booked a flight that needed ‚Äúprocessing for 24 hours‚Äù they pulled money from my account more than what the ticket was(by a little over 200 more than the ticket I picked) and they called the next day to say my booked flight was unavailable and they could get me a similar flight for 200 more. Then tried to argue a no cancelation policy. For a flight unavailable to me! Absolutely ridiculous. DO NO RECOMMEND | Twice I attempted to book round trip tickets and the first time they called and said the zip code was wrong and that the price had gone up from 536$ to 789$. I told them to cancel. Second time I tried to book they sent an email asking me to call them and they gave me the same run around that all the tickets were sold out at the lower price and tried to quote a price that was over 100$ more than just directly booking on AA site itself. What a scam! Would leave 0 stars if it allowed me. | Booked a flight for $382 received call a little while later stating that rate had change to $600+ so I said forget it, to which was told I then would forfeit $382 to cancel. Had to explain law and then was offered a $480 + flight to which I responded with legal implications of callers actions and promised to follow through and prevent others from same experience. This app is nothing but click bait and riddled with fraud/scam tactics. Apple needs to vet apps much better! 
T.Thompson/Cyber Security Analyst Expert | These tickets are fake, bait and switch is their business model. List fake flights and then after booking, they say your card ‚Äúdeclined‚Äù and when you call customer service, they try to sell you the flight at the current rate of all competitors. Very slimy! | Don‚Äôt install this app. The prices look great, but schedules were not the same as other apps. Even so, I was optimistic and I booked a flight for a certain amount of money along with a cancellation fee. I kept getting emails that booking was pending, and when I called, the fare was no longer available but they were waiting to confirm at a different price. When I tried to cancel the process, they wanted to withhold the cancellation fee I chose to include for 14.99. When I called them out on the fact that if the flight wasn‚Äôt booked at that rate, there was no ‚Äúcancellation‚Äù, so they couldn‚Äôt rightfully withhold that fee. They hung up on me!! 
Very hard to understand agents from what sounds like India. | With kayak I found a cheapest one | I booked a flight to chicago and everything was set. They canceled my booking and kept yelling over the phone trying to make ME seem like i was the one that canceled it so they could charge me a fee?? Insane | This is complete garbage. No matter how many times I try to book a flight, I get an email back saying my credit card didn‚Äôt go through. Then when I call the number in the email, they tell me the price for the ticket changed and now it‚Äôs more expensive. This seems like a bait and switch scam. Don‚Äôt waste your time on this app. I will be deleting this scam app. I‚Äôll use Hopper instead. I have never had any problems with that app | They sale you on a flight we for one cost. Then call you back 5 mins later and say they are now sold out and you have to buy the premium seats. Don‚Äôt recommend at all. | An absolute bait-and-switch con job. I twice tried to buy a ticket from this app, but it turns out that what you‚Äôre buying isn‚Äôt really a ticket, it‚Äôs more like a ‚Äúbid‚Äù on one. They don‚Äôt actually seem to be selling the tickets themselves, but rather ‚Äúpromotional offers‚Äù that end up being rejected by the airline after you buy it. So, I thought I was buying a bona-fide airline ticket (twice, because I thought maybe the first time was a glitch or a fluke), and then a few hours later (or maybe even the next day) they‚Äôll send you an email saying ‚Äúyour booking is on hold, you must call us to fix it‚Äù, and then when you call them to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it they say ‚Äúoh the airline rejected your bid, here are a bunch of other fares we have instead thar are at least twice as much‚Äù as you were looking to originally spend.

Cheapest flights available, which is so helpful for a college student like myself! 10/10 do recommend. | Their customer service team is full of liars. Do not try the general English line | Great website and super cheap prices, but the app is constantly crashing and is nearly unusable. | It‚Äôs showing high prices compare with other Apps | I booked a flight one night for $344, which was then cancelled because ‚ÄúThe price went up as I was purchasing the ticket‚Äù. I checked the next day and it was the same price. I called and asked why I‚Äôm not able to book the next day after checking and they said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unavailable‚Äù so I asked ‚Äúwhy is it still in the website‚Äù and the lady kept putting the blame on me and avoiding the question and told me ‚ÄúYou can pay over the phone the higher price and a $10 manual payment fee‚Äù. Absolutely ridiculous. You‚Äôre better off using Expedia | I love this app I got best rates | Every time I try to view my trips, it bugs and just closes the app. | Since downloading the app back in November of 2023, I have not been able to see any information regarding my trip abroad after logging in. I instead received the message saying ‚ÄúSomething went wrong try again later‚Äù. Please fix | Doesn‚Äôt give you any more of a discount on flights than any other site and often makes you flights non-refundable. I don‚Äôt see the point of the site and would not recommend using it. | My flight was canceled due to the 737 groundings and the airline texted me to notify me of this and said I would receive an email with more information about next steps. I never received such an email from the airline. 4hrs later I received an email from student universe notifying me of this change, asking if I wanted to accept the absurd new flight they booked me on. This was after I had already tried to call the airline about the absurd new flight (2days after my original departure date and an 18hr layover), and called student universe to try and get a better flight. I thought this issue was handled after I spoke to the second student universe representative - the first one had no idea what he was doing. I rebooked a flight on a new airline, as I was told I was getting a refund, only to learn when I landed, that they still had not contacted the airline for a refund, but had instead booked me on yet another absurd alternative flight. Just absolutely horrible experience. I thought student universe was a great company for the prices, but their customer service is not worth the lack of price. They will not be in any way helpful if any thing happens to your flight. You can tell them what you want to happen, that you cannot add 2 days to your trip, that you want to decline the offered alternative flights and just get a refund, but no. They don‚Äôt listen and don‚Äôt fight for you as the customer | difficult to use it. no live chat. | Run if you plan to use it! | I am trying to look for a ticket and it‚Äôs showing me prices but then it says the discounted ones aren‚Äôt available unless I verify my status and when I upload the document it just keeps saying uploaded and never actually finishes and I waited for over 10 minutes | This app charged me $30 extra for the flight when compared to other airline sites and to cancel it within 24 hr booking they are charging $40. | I recently had a frustrating experience with an airline and Student Universe. I opted not to take the initial leg of my flight and used alternative means to reach my destination. However, to my dismay, the airline cancelled my return flight without offering any compensation. This left me with no choice but to purchase a new return ticket at additional cost.

When I reached out to Student Universe for assistance, they were unhelpful, citing a clause in their contract which states that if a passenger does not use the first leg of their journey, they forfeit the entire trip. This policy feels quite unfair and was not adequately highlighted at the time of booking. The lack of flexibility and support in this situation was disappointing, and it‚Äôs important for potential customers to be aware of such policies and the implications they might have on their travel plans. | I can‚Äôt even look at available flights without the app crashing. I had this installed for about 2 hours before trashing it. | They charge you higher than just booking on a regular site | The site not even work when you try selecting from where u want fly it‚Äôs not even give you option don‚Äôt waste time for this app‚Ä¶. | Wasn‚Äôt able to print out itinerary, or save to My Wallet. I can‚Äôt find my ticket in the app at all, don‚Äôt like this app. | This app is so slow to load, regardless of what kind of connection I‚Äôm using. I can‚Äôt even load the hotel page because it takes 5+ minutes. | Super easy to use and amazing student discounts. With all my school loans, I will take any student perks I can get! Thanks StudentUniverse! :) | This was a waste of time and false advertising! The prices are the same on any other website. Don‚Äôt waste your time or phone storage downloading the app!! | Amazing | This app is deceitful and manipulative | It says I need to update the app but there is no update to offer on apple and I cannot use the app. | It promts me to update but I don‚Äôt see the update in appstore. Can even use the app. | If you download and open the app, it will tell you to upgrade to the newest update, then take you back to the app store ‚Ä¶.. but there is no update . | i heard about this app and decided to compare air fares from google flights. i was able to locate the same exact flight on google and compared it to the one on this app. i found that google flights‚Äô fare was 6 dollars cheaper than this app. 
if you want to verify this, just pick a random flight on google flights and look it up on this app and compare to see. | Because I book tickets for my mom
And I request for wheelchair but 
She can not get any wheelchair 
Tickets is India Ahm to Washington DC
Any airport | Student Universe is my go to app for flight bookings. | Oh wow, did not really touch food ever in this place | Worst platform to book the flight. If we want to postpone or prepone the flight they are charging more when compared with other platforms. Better to book a flight in direct airline sites. I don‚Äôt want to give rating. | I had a horrible experience from airport staff and contacted studentuniverse but they were unresponsive. I tried contacting them multiple times. I contacted my bank and the airlines directly who gave me the refund for $1700 for the inconvenience. But these crazy people, not only did they rebilled my account after4 MONTHS with $1700 again, even after telling all the details what happened, they as a merchant straightaway lied to the airlines to finally rebilling the amount from my card again. This is the worst website you could choose for getting $10 bucks of discount and then you‚Äôre going to suffer later and you could never expect any help from them. Studentuniverse are very active only when it comes to sucking money out of your pocket. They told the airlines I cancelled the ticket, but in reality I was talking about the one way ticket where i experienced this whole situation, not during the return ticket which I cancelled later. (For which I never received the refund btw) I would never ever recommend anybody to book from this website it‚Äôs a total scam they don‚Äôt care about the passengers at all!!! | Won‚Äôt save nothing, plus very difficult to communicate with and customer executives aren‚Äôt supportive | It‚Äôs cheaper if you go through the website of the air line | I‚Äôve been using this app for about a year and a half without any issues. However, since the last update, it‚Äôs been crashing while searching for flights and it‚Äôs now impossible to use. | Just there was an easy way to add trip details to my calendar. I have to do it manually. And when I share my trip info with my gf, she says she has to enter in my email address and confirmation number to view the itinerary‚Äîso many unnecessary steps.

Product owner needs to ask themself why they chose to implement the ability to explore next trip based on user‚Äôs zodiac sign over the ability to add to calendar. Bad choice IMO. | A friend of mine told me that this was a good app to find good prices as a college student. Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt been able to see if it‚Äôs as great as she told me because it wouldn‚Äôt let me confirm my student status, and I‚Äôm scare of but the tickets without doing that first because what if they raise my prices last minute because of that? What if they end up charging me more claiming that it‚Äôs because I never confirmed my student status? If anyone can help me with that I‚Äôll be more than thankful and happy to change my review | I fly a lot, a lot a lot, I flew booking with student universe too, gave them second chances at thought maybe it‚Äôll save money. NO. Please listen it‚Äôll save you so many headaches, they won‚Äôt and can‚Äôt save you anything. Absolute scam, their whole MO is making customers think they‚Äôre paying less, but they NEVER BOOK YOU WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. They always say ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù when you book BUT ITS ACTUALLY ECONOMY LIGHT AT BEST. Not even light, the ones with absolute no carry-on/baggage at all, last second tickets that other companies toss away. If they tell you that going in, whatever, but be prepared to pay an extra $300 USD for every international flight (the whole flight is only $400). There‚Äôs no way to know what flight they‚Äôre booking for you since they lie and say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know baggage allowance‚Äù and you don‚Äôt know until a few days before when you can check in to your airline‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs so fuqed up who would book an international flight without even a CARRY ON??? The whole thing is so shady, so deceitful, zero transparency. They know what they‚Äôre doing, ridiculous company that scams ‚Äústudents‚Äù without being upfront on what kind of flights are being booked. Their profit margins must be huge but they have zero ethical values. Hopefully they get sued someday, this happens for every. flight. I‚Äôve. Booked. Basically booking.com with less transparency and false assurance of ‚Äúhelping poor students.‚Äùü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è a lot of you might be like me, false hope it‚Äôll save you something, please I beg you just avoid, you have enough stress on your plate as is. | Way to expensive | I‚Äôve always had a lot of years of student universe. Their stuff are super helpful and quick to rearrange flight plans. Their app is easy to use and I love their prices. | I haven‚Äôt found any relevant deals for me and decided to delete the app because I also didn‚Äôt feel comfortable giving any ID information, but the app simply won‚Äôt give you the option to delete your account! | Love it. Short, Sweet & to the Point. | Easy to sign up but I did not see anywhere to confirm a flight or check-in.  Rates are ridiculously inexpensive! | ^^ | There literally just isn‚Äôt a reason to use StudentUniverse. They add fees with no clear benefit to using their services and terrible assistance. They‚Äôre trying to charge +$700 for a flight change. Save yourself the headache and just book straight through an airline, I‚Äôm not even sure why this company exists. | Twice my booking was cancelled for stupid reason. Won‚Äôt recommend it to anyone. | i‚Äôm looking for newark, nj airport flights and keep showing me La Guardia, NY information why??? | I love this app, not many adds, hustle free and really good prices, if you‚Äôre a student or under 25 years old I‚Äôd highly recommend using this app | I love Student Universe! I book almost every flight with them because they have great deals and I‚Äôve never had any problems.

If you get stressed about which platform, which train, which exit...then this is the app. | I live in NYC and this is my main form of transit help. It‚Äôs easy to use. You add your home address, work, and favorite place to find a route with a click of a button.

The only issue is that sometimes it gets train arrival times incorrect. In my case, the 7 train never has correct arrival times. For some reason, around midday (mostly around 1:40) at least, it says that the 7 train is going to arrive at my designated station starting 3 pm. 

I have to google maps so I can get on the 7 train, which is twice a week I have to do this. 

Pls fix! | Sometimes the location on what part of the train to enter be inaccurate | Ok Wow this app puts google maps to absolute shame. I‚Äôm a New Yorker who prefers to take the bus when I can (sunlight + cell service!) but NYC bus schedules can be notoriously unreliable depending on traffic, weather, politics of the week. This app has VERY impressive real-time tracking of trains and busses. I haven‚Äôt waited 15 minutes for a train or bus in months now because I check this long before I do google maps. THANK YOU | App no longer works‚Äî won‚Äôt let me change departure location. When I try the screen goes black and the app crashes. I updated it and the same thing happens. | So baffled‚Ä¶ did anybody ask for this??? | Can‚Äôt believe what a wonderful and efficient APP this is!üëçüòä
It works perfect and took me all around the city I was in. | Love Citymapper especially the ‚Äúbest doors‚Äù features. I can stay out of everyone‚Äôs way, deal with public transit snafus with ease, and get where I want to go without unnecessary hassle. | App works great for getting around the city. Only thing that would make it better is allowing me to out multiple stops in and the solving for the best way to do them all. | It was priceless. Helped with the, bus, walking and biking. | Used to be Moovit // I even coined the tagline // CityMapper FTW | I was on a trip to England and I was lost and I relented my you guide recommended me this app. And I haven‚Äôt not used for since then | Great App | I live and travel all over the place, and Citymapper has been the most reliable navigation app I‚Äôve used. Others are fine as well, but I really like their interface, the clean layout showing all the options (walking, transit, cars, etc), and - living mostly in Paris - especially the alerts re service outages in various transit lines. It‚Äôs reliable, works in most major cities (I have used it extensively in Paris, London, and LA personally), and even the free version (with minor footer ads, not obtrusive to the usability) is great. Big fan. | I wish there was a widget or a live activity for a specific station without the entire transit navigation to keep an eye on a specific bus in a specific bus stop. If one is missed the other is shown. This would really help in catching the next bus. | I downloaded this app after coming across a recommendation, but it‚Äôs been a letdown. The app crashes every time I try to start a trip, despite my software being up-to-date and attempting a restart. Unfortunately, Citymapper is unusable at worst and unreliable and buggy at best. | I downloaded and tried Citymapper on a recent trip to Spain. Incredible experience! I quickly found myself preferring Citymapper over other major map apps. I even found it more reliable walking, but the transit options were terrific. Fantastic experience! | Works great in NYC, train times are accurate and offers far more routing choices than google/apple. Goes above and beyond with info about subway exits and Citi bike stations. Unbelievably, it‚Äôs free. Not for place search, but Citymapper is in a class of its own for getting from point to point. | Wow! Incremental updates but it‚Äôs looking so good üëè | And the best part is, it‚Äôs free | Works great but hate the new update. | If you‚Äôve any issues whatsoever with the app, rest assure that NO CUSTOMER SERVICE exists at all! I‚Äôve sent multiple emails (cause that‚Äôs the ONLY way from within the app) and waited forever and NOTHING. I‚Äôm just gonna delete the app and be done with it. 
Advice: Stay away from this service | Trust me when i say that you will definitely need this app when travelling to singapore specially for those who are new to the lion city ü§ç | Google maps is sometimes better. | This will get you anywhere you need to be in the world, as long as there is public transportation. | I cant without this app when I travel!  Would be cool to see to the trip options by price. | Great app especially for newcomers to city. | City mapper is point onüëçüèΩ | Best of best just use it for while and you will realise why it is best. | I‚Äôve tried other apps and they pale in comparison. Citymapper has been my go-to app for all things transit for years. 

I primarily get around by bike, and Citymapper is consistently more accurate, efficient, and sensible with bike routing than Google Maps ever is. 

On public transit, it will give you correct up-to-the-minute information you can rely on. 

Highly recommend this app above the rest | I would be totally lost without CityMapper on my week-long trip to New York City! A must-have for tourists!!! | I‚Äôve taken city mapper in many cities in the states and Europe and it continues to provide the best comprehensive transit information services. It‚Äôs not always perfect, but who amongst us is. It‚Äôs honestly such a gem! | Twice now my travel estimates have been off by 20-25m.  I use this app to figure out the fastest route to any location and avoid any train delays but it‚Äôs useless now. | I started a trip and the Dynamic Island is till showing stops even though the trip needed. I quit the app, and even restarted my phone. This is second time I‚Äôve experienced | Google is a privacy-hostile company. Use Apple Maps instead.

There also needs to be an iPad app. I have wrist pain and it‚Äôs much easier to use bigger screens. 

Lastly, the app should be enabled for Apple Vision Pro. I wanted to plan a route while using it and was very disappointed to see that it was disabled. | Thank you for making things so much easier | L‚Äôapplication n‚Äôarr√™te pas de buger. Mais aussi tr√®s bonne application juste les bug √ßa rend fou et √ßa d√©pense trop d‚Äô√©nergie | And always accurate | Greatest app in NYC for all transportation means. | Saved my life a couple times now :) | This app is a lifesaver! I come from a very rural area and am not used to traveling by metro much. Planned my first trip by metro that would involve multiple transfers and would be traveling alone and was super nervous, but thanks to this app I made it through! Plans out every step of the way (including what platform you need to be on - so helpful!) and updates for accurate train times and reroutes you to avoid delays. Absolutely made this trip possible and stress free for me, cannot recommend enough! | This app was once the best option for transit directions in NYC. Unfortunately recently the app has really gone downhill. Constant crashing, a glitchy interface, and consistently incorrect train information render this app useless. It makes more since to use Apple Maps or Google maps as the information in those apps is actually correct, which is very disappointing. | To whoever created this app, THANK YOU!!!
This is more effective and useful than any other app I have put to use. | This has been my favorite app for years - in fact, I depend on it now. In the past few weeks the app started acting funky and stopped working. I tried changing all my settings but nothing helped. So I deleted the app and downloaded it again. The app won‚Äôt even start, it freezes on a fully green screen. What‚Äôs going on? I will change my rating once I get some support, I wasn‚Äôt even able to get to the support page because the app does not work. All my other apps on my phone work fine, so it‚Äôs not my phone that‚Äôs the problem. Thanks! | I have been using this app for years for free.  Used it all over the UK and now back in the USA and D.C. I find it more accurate information the Metro Systems App and Google map app.

I recommend this app to people I see lost, all the time. | Based on Citymapper I bet my friend drinks for the night that I would beat him to the UWS. Citymapper said I would win handedly and I lost. 1 star. And someone owes me a $100 bar tab.

I found this difficult to enroll and did not know which plan I was being enrolled to with the card. It was clear as mud. | How do I edit my address?  Edit buttons don‚Äôt work in app. | This application is completely worthless. Will only let you select American Express, which I do not have obviously. Talk about a real disappointment. | No clubs in the most popular airports, and more locations close than open. Perhaps if you fly out of one of the very few airports that still has clubs it makes sense, but a pass for everyone else. The app is fine | I a member of a few and have found Priority to be the best of all lounges including Admiral and United | And now won‚Äôt show up as app on fone. Its there but no widget.  Super irritating | Unable to use the priority pass as a Chase Sapphire member. What a waste of this benefit. | I‚Äôm disappointed.   I‚Äôm here sitting in some miserable gate seats for hours in miserable terminal 5 at ORD.  Swissport Lounge was ‚Äúat capacity‚Äù but then the guys lists off airlines who‚Äôs passengers that do have access.   This is worthless.   This card represents the 2nd class leftovers like the dummies that you see waiting outside a night club because they are ‚Äúat capacity‚Äù and aren‚Äôt on ‚Äúthe list‚Äù.  

I suppose it is a marketing thing to show the world that they can have access to all these lounges to sell it the product, just to get rejected and realize they‚Äôve been duped.  

I‚Äôm going to write a review in every place that I can.  I‚Äôve got 3 hours to kill before my flight and another 16 hour plane ride with WiFi after that.  

Good luck with your business model. | I I joined Capital One Venture X card which says that I can be a member of Priority Pass. It‚Äôs been over a month now, and Priority Pass says they don‚Äôt recognize my card number. I called Priority Pass. They told me to call my bank. I called my bank they told me to call priority pass. This appears to be an unresolved issue and I think it is a scam. Reporting it to Better Business Bureau.
Just received a response from Priority Pass to this complaint. They told me to reach out to Customer Service. My arms are sore from reaching out to their customer service as well as Capital One. Continue to be disappointed in this offer. Deborah Owens. | Attempted to visit this Lounge and while few persons were visible in it we were told that is was all booked and we could not enter.  About 18 people we waiting to enter this vast understaffed facility when we arrived.

Clearwater, FL | The app used to be great. Now I can see my renewed priority pass card but have no ability to change the expiration date on the credit card attached to reflect the new date. It gives the option to edit but when selected does not allow you to make any changes just exit back out. Also, it does not seem to be showing lounge information for almost any airport and I know there are lounges in some I regularly use. It has become useless. | I was looking forward to setting up my account with the Priority Pass but I‚Äôve struggled to even get the website to recognize my card number and two attempts to call the service number have resulted in calls being ended without being answered. Wish the experience were better, but it‚Äôs been absolutely disappointing | App or their website won‚Äôt let me change billing info. | So many website/app errors | None of the lounges were available because they weren‚Äôt giving Priority Pass access because there‚Äôs not enough tables. | Terrible app. Doesn‚Äôt work. | Great service, ugly new logo | Just tried to get in the lounge in lima, Peru, and was told my pass was not valid. | Priority Pass was involved in a data breach and now we cannot change our passwords through the app. The function simply doesn‚Äôt work | All doesn‚Äôt allow me to activate my account. I enter my membership number and click submit and nothing happens. Try by credit card and same. I just had to delete the app. I see all the bad recent reviews so why keep trying. | This has not been good for a very long time. I can‚Äôt recall the last time I was able to even use it. It‚Äôs a very disappointing (non) perk. | I loved using this pass at the Montego Bay airport. The food options were phenomenal and the space was cozy and relaxing. It was the perfect escape from the loud crowded spaces at the departure gates. I highly recommend priority pass! | I used to absolutely love the benefits of Priority Pass, and would always renew my membership. Now it is not worth it, I do not see much benefit to having it if your travels are primarily within the United States. Most airports nowadays seem to not have Priority Pass supported lounges. It seems that Priority Pass got cheap on us. Also, the app only has a few available airport maps, yet this is a big advertisement for the app. | Changed credit cards and had to get new Priority Pass. Even though old card is expired I can‚Äôt change my old user name to the new card. I tried contacting support to delete account but they were worse than useless. | I‚Äôm unable to update my personal information from my iPhone including my address and card information. I do like that it automatically finds the nearest airport. | Unable to retire e passwalrd or username due to nonfunctional buttons. | So, I keep seeing signs at establishments that have the Priority Pass logo and then once I present my card I'm told it‚Äôs not valid if the card is issued by AMEX or Capital One. THAT‚ÄôS certainly not something that is advertised. | I‚Äôve been a member for two years now and have been able to use the Priority Pass in many airports - almost all the airports I‚Äôve gone through have some PP option. 
The cost compared to what you get is really an outstanding value - definitely recommend to fellow travelers. | Almost no clubs at US airports | Several times we had to wait to get in the lounges. Cabo, twice and in Atlanta 45 minutes wait for one lounge and went to the other and it was a 15 minute wait and all seats were taken had to sit at bar stools. | LAX has no any lounge and it‚Äôs very poor! | Card expired and I cannot update the new expiry date in the app. | If more recent photos could be added would be great. Adding map of the airport to show location and walking time to lounge would make this 5 stars! | Cannot get any help AT All very disappointed traveling today to Denver oil maybe made a mistake with Capital one venture card | I recently had an unpleasant encounter with the front desk attendant at the Cibao airport Priority Club. Upon arrival, I expected to be greeted with warmth and professionalism, but unfortunately, I was met with rudeness and indifference. The attendant seemed disinterested in assisting me and displayed a lack of basic courtesy.

Not only did this tarnish my experience with the club, but it also left a negative impression of the entire establishment. As a frequent traveler, I value exceptional customer service, and this experience fell short of my expectations.

I hope that management takes steps to address this issue and ensure that all staff members embody the level of hospitality expected in such a setting. Until then, I hesitate to recommend this Priority Club to fellow travelers.

Thanks
Juan | It is a good perk to have when you travel but it is dissapointing that some lounges have limited hours, some that dont change their food/menu for months and months and some that you can access only before security check or if you are in transfer, you have to exit, go to lounge and then pass security again and that is what does not make sense because you will ‚Äúsave‚Äù money but waste a lot of time. Not bad anyway | I love this app because it quickly tells me what lounges I can use in any airport! | Half the lounges in this app don‚Äôt accept priority pass and the rest have a quota so you will be often turned away. I feel bad for anyone who actually pays money for this thing 

The priority pass lounges are often cheaper busier versions of nice lounges (Phuket has 3 lounges listed but only the smallest one accepts the card) or none (SFO we walked around for an hour to try all 3 international lounges and none let us in)

Also the map in the app is totally useless ‚Äî it has routing but you can‚Äôt search for a gate or locate yourself! | The Bangalore lounge denied me access because I didn‚Äôt have my physical card with me.
I had this app. I was logged in‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt find the virtual card. | Why have this pass when nothing is ever available? | No lounges via Priority Pass in LAX. Zero. Nada. Not good. | Holding a chase sapphire  reserve credit card, we travel a lot from LAX. No lounge here. | I have been to several lounges that say they don‚Äôt accept priority pass. For ones that do, the app here often has wrong opening hours or amenity information. 

In some places, Priority Pass is nearly useless anyway since it‚Äôs so over-subscribed. | Information is consistently wrong. Really fun to walk to a lounge and find you don‚Äôt have access, that the times are wrong, etc. Considering that priority pass is a membership you‚Äôd think they would allocate some funding to make sure this app is correct | We were surprised to learn that they would not bring out any more omelets because they were all out. Hot water was also out.  However, I must give a shout out to Alex who went around tables to clear finished items. He works hard to keep the tables clean. We really appreciated his diligence. | Unusable

Just make the card digital already.  It‚Äôs comical that you have to show a physical card at lounges | Friendly staff, very good hospitality! | Zero coverage in many major airports, but options plenty at others.  If your favorite cities around covered, it‚Äôs not much help. | Very crowded at 10 am on Sunday with many small loud children, think of a day care center.  Broccoli salad is excellent.  Services are great. | There are very few lounges available even in the largest airports. I‚Äôve been able to use it twice in five years and I travel every week. That‚Äôs just how useless it is. Two times I encountered lounges that were advertised to accept Priority Pass only to get turned away that they were not accepting Priority Pass for entry at that time. Think twice before accepting that included lounge access via Priority Pass is any benefit (eg, credit card programs).

Since the dawn of time, stories have been the way in which values and knowledge are passed from one generation to the next ‚Äî each adding their wisdom and experience along the way.

It‚Äôs time to connect with the sum of our experience, to enrich our lives with the stories of today, and to inspire the great storytellers yet to come.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/29/15/28/29152850-3551-669d-ebf8-03d325487caf/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-5-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Entertainment""]","[""6003"",""6016""]","Travel",6003,"12+","[""EN""]","74723328","13.0","2020-08-04T07:00:00Z","2024-03-18T14:20:31Z","Grab your passports: Autio is going to Ireland!

We recommend it to all our friends! | Well designed app with really interesting stories. It‚Äôs a freemium subscription model, though, which may not be obvious to all. Decent value to me, though. | I guess I‚Äôll post this again?? 

I‚Äôd give this negative stars if I could.

The app has deceptive advertising and poor UX/UI. The stories are not user generated and might as well be someone reading a Wikipedia article about something to you. 

Pressing the pause button skips to the next story and there‚Äôs no way to escape the subscription page, forcing you to close the app. | This was good when it was Hear Here, but it‚Äôs taken a ‚Äúlong march through the institutions‚Äù (iykyk) hard turn into leftist racial lecturing. If I wanted to hear that I‚Äôd walk into Berkeley‚Äôs latest drum circle. I don‚Äôt want to pay to listen to screeching Marxists, that‚Äôs what the university system is for. | I accidentally signed up and now I have something I dont want for a year!
Why can I nit cancel after 1hour, just finding out I have a subscription!  
Boooo! | Notifications don‚Äôt work in CarPlay, and it should suggest stories within a radius of your location. It should also work with Maps to navigate to the point of interest being talked about. All these things were promised in the YouTube video, but don‚Äôt work in CarPlay. I want my money back!! | Unfortunately the app was super glitchy. 
We were disappointed to not be able to use it on our trip! | Many of the names and locations local to us were mispronounced, and some of the stories were not correct. It made me doubt the accuracy of all the stories I was not familiar with. | I love hearing all the stories when I drive but wish there was a little more‚Ä¶
- stories that don‚Äôt repeat 
- stories that align with the direction I‚Äôm driving. 
-stories that are near where I‚Äôm driving and not 100 miles away in a direction that I am not driving
-stories that are told before I‚Äôve passed an area and not 1 hour later
-stories that automatically load into the app so I‚Äôm not playing with the app while I drive

I drive to many unique places. The stories make the places I drive by much more interesting , plus keeps me alert. But the app is also clunky and non intuitive.  So many times I‚Äôve stopped listening because I can‚Äôt mess with the app while I drive. | It will only work sporadically. A waste of money | I love having this app tell me about the places I‚Äôm passing.  The stories are just long enough, super diverse and always interesting.  Can‚Äôt live without it now. | How fun to hear about your own Neighborhood and the places you drive through on your travels!! | Tried using this app via ‚ÄúCar Play‚Äù while traveling through Yellowstone.  Although I had location services turned on to ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù the app failed to update the playlist as I passed new Autio points of interest.  I could only access new content if I opened the app on my phone which defeats the purpose of hands free Car Play. | Little surprises as I drive around. Our family is really enjoying this app! | Love the idea. As soon as I heard about it I downloaded it. Tried out a few of the free stories. They were great. Not overly detailed but good. After I ran out of the free ones I checked out the plans. WAY too expensive for what it is. More than Spotify or so many other apps that honestly provide more value. Too bad but I won‚Äôt be able to use this based on the cost. | I am a trucker LOVE this app I love learning about the different stories and history of the areas I run and just little tid bits and I even have saved some stuff I would love to go see one day!! That I had no idea was there before this app!! Would recommend 10/10!!! | This app now collects data on how you drive in an effort to market car insurance to you.  They have not made clear precisely what data they collect and have not offered a way to prevent such data collection, short of turning of location devices which would completely deprecate the utility of the app.  The privacy description in the App Store should be updated immediately to reflect this, and an opt out function should be clearly defined and provided. | Makes your trip fun! It‚Äôs unique to listen to the history of towns you travel through. | It would be great if there was an unbiased narrative of the history of the sites. But the strong does of political opinions makes this an inaccurate source of the facts. | Not as advertised very few stories even in important areas. Maybe 10 more years of work it may be useful. | Information is very valuable but not always reliable as to the actual site of the incident. | Headed out West and tried the trial - The 5 stories I listened to in the trial seemed like the hero is never Roosevelt or an American explorer. With Autio, the native Americans are always the heroes and the white man/explorers are the villain. Never mind and mentions very little about the exploration or engineering feats achieved at that time. 
An example would be with Mt Rushmore: there is so much more history/how it was done that I wanted to learn about after visiting it. But the focus seemed to be on the Lakota Sioux being forced out.
I can greatly appreciate the history there but I wish that wasn‚Äôt the sole focus. Would love to see the app being more well-rounded. | I have always wondered about the places I pass when driving. Now I know.
Great App | I live in the center of Pennsylvania and there were 5 stories in like a 3 hour radius from my area. The big story from my city was ‚Äúthe courthouse was the place of the Sandusky child sex abuse scandal‚Äù Of course they said some other things but for real! First no one wants to hear about a child sex scandal while hiking. I‚Äôm close to Penn state university. Plenty of nice things they could have talked about. I‚Äôm sure anyone that was involved in that hearing does not want to hear about it highlighting the area while hiking. Poor taste in general. Not a fan of the app at all. Too overpriced for literally nothing. Not nearly enough content. I would give it one stars a thousand times over | I should be able to trust this as historically accurate. I live in Cherokee County Alabama and was surprised that one of ""Our Landmarks"" was
""The Jeminson-Van de Graaff Mansion"", Which is 150 miles in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
I immediately deleted the app. | I use carplay and the notifications don‚Äôt pop up or make a sound to know that there‚Äôs something nearby.  If I happen to see that there was one on my phone and tap on it, it will start playing.  But it then continues with a bunch of stories that are either way behind me or ahead of me.  I‚Äôd like it to turn off and go back to my music.
Would also be great if there was a setting to just automatically play something when I‚Äôm nearby.  I‚Äôm mostly driving an RV by myself and don‚Äôt like to be distracted by fiddling around with buttons.  
Those 2 adjustments would make it a 5 star. | I recently took a train trip from Tampa to DC.  This app really helped pass the time.  I only wish that there was access to more American History and not just the lesser known stories.  Would love to see some regional on-demand history stories. | Autio finally got the car app working but it‚Äôs just a list, no map integration

Also the stories can be a little dry. I would almost prefer a riff channel where entertaining folks comment on the present gestalt of a place rather than just history. | I love the idea and the stories are really informative and entertaining. We are going on a grand Amtrak trip this summer and a search function would make this perfect. | Do your homework.  Intentionally racist reporting? | It a perfect traveling companion for curious
Road trippers. It‚Äôs fun to learn the history near 
Where you live too! | It‚Äôs a good idea but you only get 5 free stories then you have to pay. Not that many stories where I‚Äôm interested in to make it worth the investment. | We love listening to the stories on the Autio app. Wish this had been around a long time ago. Such a great idea. Makes driving trips much better. | Professionally produced and narrated stories that transport you to another time. Often as I drive through the places narrated in the app, I can almost feel as if I‚Äôm there whether a center or a decade ago. Countless discoveries in my own hometown. Look forward to taking the app on the family road trip. I know the soothing voices of the narrators will keep my daughter entertained for a bit. | I saw this app on Shark Tank and as a truck driver decided to download it. I‚Äôve had the app for about 30 minutes and not only have I learned things around me, I‚Äôve learned things about where I live I never even knew. | I seen this app on Shark Tank. I am wondering if there is a chance in the future that you offer the service for free with ADs. | Why do apps block my password manager or make it difficult to use. I gave up creating a log in when I couldn‚Äôt access 1Password easily. Seems like an interesting idea but too much effort required to try. | Deleted immediately after seeing the monthly subscription option. Give me a one time flat rate or give me nothing. | Excited to hear the rich history in my favorite places but all I heard was the white history. Nothing about the indigenous peoples or miners who lived in the area.  The areas were Colorado Ski Country- keystone, Silverthorne, Dillon. Out of touch! | Exactly the type of information we should all be wanting to absorb when traveling thru parts unknown, or even seemingly known. I‚Äôve learned more about my hometown from Autio then in just being here. I love everything about it. Cool when folks like Kevin Costner and  Phil Jackson drop in with a story even now and again, too. Five big stars! | Great idea but it didn‚Äôt work for me. I got it for a cross country RV trip but didn‚Äôt get to use it even once. Couldn‚Äôt log in. Now I‚Äôm notified that it‚Äôs up for renewal. Difficult to cancel. Waisted $35 of my travel budget on this app. | I love road trips and the stories in Autio have guided me through travels on both the east and west coasts of America. They are entertaining, educational and humorous. The app works seamlessly as you travel from one area to another. Wish Autio was around back in the days when I had an RV! | But we were going on a road trip and I figured, this would be a good investment for some entertainment.  Well, we‚Äôve used it on 3 road trips in the western US and have learned a lot of things you wouldn‚Äôt normally get from a textbook‚Äîand it presents the pieces to you when you‚Äôre right in the area each thing happened!  Pair this with Mike Rowe‚Äôs 10-minute ‚ÄúThe Way I Heard It‚Äù podcast episodes and you‚Äôll keep your brain going on your drive.

This was worth it.  I wish it was just a one time fee and not a subscription, but I get that they have to pay for all the research and all that goes into making this app.  I think it‚Äôs well worth it! | Makes driving much more enjoyable !! | I love this App, it gives you a lot of good information. | I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing stories based on my current location as I drive around.

Update: it still says that I have no saved stories and even though I tell it to update all the time, now both the iPhone CarPlay don‚Äôt show any stories! | I listened to five stories as a free trial.  The copy could be lifted straight from a roadside plaque.  The facts hang there suspended in motes of the driest prose illuminated by scintillating narration but still bloodless.  In this age of ubiquitous brilliant podcasts I need better writing or a well-produced interview.  Even Kevin Costner can‚Äôt make me care about these stories. | We are enjoying this and look forward to using it again but narrators or producers really need to make a quick call to the State Travel board or any state native and get their pronunciation correct.  There were a dozen mispronounced names or words listening to the Utah state stories.  Just a tiny bit of homework would have fixed that and the mispronounced words or names really distracted from the stories.  And it made you doubt the correctness of the facts. | The stories are great and well put together, but the app is only as good as the cell signal. We like it though. | I got a new phone and I am trying to reset my password.  I can reset it with the link they send to my email but can‚Äôt use the new password to log into my phone.

They let me book and experience for 2 hours away from where i stay on Wednesday for a Sunday, confirmed the booking, and send me my confirmation number. So I book travel for the day, and make arrangements. Then Saturday night they cancelled via email to say it‚Äôs overbooked. AVOID AT ALL COSTS | This app is worse than useless. I booked a tour, paid money, then found out 4 days later there was no availability. And since I was counting on this ‚Äúbooking‚Äù all the companies have since sold out as well.

Now get to wait for my money to be returned, for a booking that never existed in the fist place. And of course Klook kept their cut ‚ÄúKlook upgrades cannot be refunded‚Äù. So they just took $10 from me on top of everything else. 

There are better apps that do the same thing, but come through. Don‚Äôt use | I was having problems purchasing tickets to Disneyland website and the app with issue with my debit card and when my cousin send me this app, it was so quick and fast. Now I don‚Äôt have to stress about it anymore. Well done Klook!!! | I was worried I was not able to use my ticket voucher for the next day, but help center syamimi was able to help me and informed me that I can use the voucher until May 18, 2024. Great job on the customer service! | Do not ever use this app for anything it‚Äôll screw up your vacation totally. They charge you upfront only to tell you they take 48 hours to confirm then says all sold out after 2 days! | To whom it may concern.

On the klook app I have noticed a few times with several different airlines when you add the flight number for example TG404 and my flight is tomorrow it changes the date of my flight airport transportation from March 26 to the flight today on March 25. They use the same flight numbers both days. It would be nice if the date not change.
Thank you. I lost money because of this. | First time user of the app.  I made a mistake traveling to Tokyo making reservations.  No help what so ever.  My transaction is still pending after i noticed the error on my part and contacted them within 15 mins of waiting in a que.  I thought this app would be great to use.  After i use the tickets i previously purchased it will get deleted. To many other apps that have better customer service. | I book basically everything for our trips on Klook. We get to discover new adventures that we may have not have even learned about without it. It saves time on queues too. Thank you Klook | Easy to use and the savings are significant! Refunds are painless and the app gives great suggestions on fun things to do! | from end-to-end this service is awful. terrible interface, completely unclear directions, complete lack of warnings like not being able to book same-day tickets, and then totally unhelpful customer service. thanks for wasting several hours of my life trying to use this ridiculous app and service | Easy to access essential promotion deal in the visited area and great customer service! Highly recommend people use their service especially traveling Asia | KLOOK is the way to go if you want to organize your trip in advance. It is easy to book and no hussle since you bought your tickets in n advance! Thanks , KLOOK! | Site is user friendly for an old dog like me üê∂ | I find the app extremely easy to use | Great service. | Although this app has a lot of good deals they also allow shady businesses apart of their app. We booked a hotel room stay for one night and on my statement it said I check in March 3rd and check out March 4th. We get to the hotel and the front desk tells us we only have the room for 2 hours and wants to upcharge us but on my statement it clearly says that I am booked for march 3rd check in and check out March 4th. The receptionist leaves to the back and never comes back out so we can‚Äôt even talk to anyone. We wait over 2 hours to speak to someone while also trying to get ahold of Klook only for them to tell us they can‚Äôt refund us because it‚Äôs the day of and my mistake.. What do you mean ??? We wasted 2 hours waiting to speak to the receptionist at the hotel and used ZERO of their services and they continue to allow business like this on their app. Be CAREFUL. | Lies and false information from Klook and then no refund. | As expected I sent them the whole story of what‚Äôs happened in the link they pretended to provide (like they care). Nope! over a week after, nothing happens, not even an acknowledge or pretend like they are working on the case. Truly, a sad customer support! Previous: This was my first time using Klook, as they seem popular in Asia. I booked a car rental, but in the confirmation email, it stated that refunds were not available on the day of the rental. I attempted to cancel my reservation one day prior, but Klook refused to issue a refund and instead suggested to a full charge. Unfortunately, there was no clear explanation about refund policies or fees prior to the rental date. Despite multiple attempts to contact their call center, I was never given a satisfactory answer about the language used in the confirmation email or why a refund was not possible, the reps were just simply ‚Äúno refund, bye‚Äù and didn‚Äôt bother to read my further questions. | I just used klook to schedule airport pickup in Hanoi, VN.  The site asked me for my flight info but didn‚Äôt realize it set the date for Feb 27 default (that‚Äôs tomorrow).  I needed the pickup for March 9th.  I realized the mistake and engaged them immediately.  They said there‚Äôs nothing they can do to cancel.  There is a 24 hour before pickup free cancellation but due to Vietnam being 12 hours ahead of the US, I was already within that 24 hour before I ever booked because of the auto date they set.  

This is a terrible way to do business. And I will not be using them again. | Very easy to navigate and all the tours we had are perfect. | Very easy to navigate thru the app. A one stop for all your train rides and experiences to purchase tickets and have all your information in one place. | I couldn‚Äôt find the booking confirmation on my email. I asked for help from Klook live chat. Muhammad A found my booking information and resent it to me. I still couldn‚Äôt locate it on the inbox.

We attempted to cancel my reservation one day prior, but Klook refused to issue a refund and instead suggested to a full charge.

Despite multiple attempts to contact their call center, we were never given a satisfactory answer about the language used in the confirmation email or why a refund was not possible, the reps were just simply ‚Äúno refund, bye‚Äù and didn‚Äôt bother to read our further questions. | I had booked tickets for gardens by the bay in Singapore. My husbands flight was delayed by 14 hours and I had reached out to the customer support to provide refund/credits so that we can see in the 5 days of trip planned. They had promised to provide refund and needed the details of the flight delay etc. when I reached out and provided, it was routed to more ‚Äúsenior specialists‚Äù and they kept chatting and asking for same proofs and that they will get back to me. While I waited, I also rebooked and saw the gardens by the bay because the agent had said if they can‚Äôt provide refund, they will give us credits if we rebook. I had faith on them. However, in the end, they still route me to different specialists and still are ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù and now say that it‚Äôs an ‚Äúopen ticket‚Äù and I can use it for 3 months. It‚Äôs useless solution for me as it was provided after I left Singapore. Extremely unprofessional and will never use Klook again. Please avoid and do not use if you ever think you might have changes to your original booking and might need help. They clearly will not help. | The Klook app is extremely user unfriendly and exceedingly difficult to use. I booked a tour trip in SE Asia for 5 people costing over $750 USD. No communication, no confirmation of pick up time or place, no way to contact the tour operator or Klook. I am extremely unhappy and very frustrated. Will never use Klook again. The user experience with Trip Advisor is so much smoother and straightforward. I have never had this type of issue with them. | App is easy to use and order restaur tickets | Good rates | I got scammed by app! No one respond from team and no one help. Was book for 17 dec but app itself confirmed 15 Dec instead 17! No one refound money or apologize. Also, I was try to book for 2 people but app give me options for 3 only‚Ä¶..after many attempt I got registered 2 people ‚Ä¶.. So, be careful, the app is not working correct and team are not supportive.So bad experience unfortunately:( | First time booked thru Klook.  Very easy, simple, fast, transparent and no hidden fees when paid with Apple Pay.  Will definitely use this app again.  I highly recommend this app to those who are visiting Thailand. | Klook purported to buy a ticket for me on the high speed train from Kyoto to Tokyo. But when I arrived in Kyoto, there was no ticket for me to pick up. Klook then refused to refund my purchase, even though they did not contest the mistake was on their end. They are thieves and scammers. Avoid. | Soo Very much helpful app ever!! | Booked several train tickets for Japan. Payment went through and booking was confirmed. 3 hours later got a notice that my booking had been canceled. No explanation. And I have to wait for the refund.

We asked for a refund they asked for proof but when we showed proof they still didn't refund us the money and told us the ticket is good for 90 days meanwhile by the time they got back to us we're already back home from Japan.

We‚Äôve been busy improving the game and addressing bugs for you. 
Enjoy!","2.12.523",0,"USD",true,520119067,"Magmatic Games Ltd","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/magmatic-games-ltd/id520119067?uo=4","https://www.moonactive.com",4.82474,"I have been playing this game for a while now and now all of a sudden the other day it stops loading. It stops loading at 35% like it‚Äôs frozen or something can you please fix it again it‚Äôs not working and I‚Äôm missing out on special events in the game. | I just an update which changed a lot of the collection items I already had. The new look of some of the items looks cheap compared the the rest and now I have more items to finish a collection that I had already finished. Not sure what the point in the update is but it‚Äôs making it very hard to meet the challenges and advance in the game on top of how hard it already was! Not happy and I hope no other existing collections change!! And if possible, would love it to go back to how it was. Specifically, the roller coaster and duck-a-duck collections and sub-collections changed. 
This game is a bit of a money grab. You have to spend money to really move forward. | I really enjoy this game, and I like the fact that I can interact with other people to collect cards and make it fun but I have an issue with this, you only get 2 trades per day and cannot trades gold cards. I been playing and trying to completed task but in order to get the task done you have to spend money and not just a little bit a lot, (which is not fair, if you want to enjoy the game without over spending) and second you don‚Äôt get gold cards I open like 10 packs one day and didn‚Äôt even got one new card or a gold one is so upsetting because I don‚Äôt want to over spend to enjoy the game. 

This should be better as time progress I lose the desire to play because I know I won‚Äôt be able to complete any task if I don‚Äôt spend money 

Other than that I like it | I just started this game today and have a logjam where I can‚Äôt merge anything and the spaces are full. There are no directions as to how to move on. Just a question at the bottom about what is behind the sand. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | I finally found a merging game that I love!! It‚Äôs challenging and fun, too! No problems either. | Every time it give you a challenge to complete within a hour or two, they make it impossible unless you spend money.  Hate game like that.  This games takes FOREVER to move up one level and no way to get extra lives without waiting or paying.   Don‚Äôt recommend | I absolutely love this game but the update on the character change confuses me and look much more unreal. I play this game every day and have spent so much money but now honestly I want my money back. I‚Äôm not mad the characters change but they look so different and so much unreal it irks me. | I am over the generators that give for 2 items! Example: the cat and dog stuff. EVERY time I need something for the dog, 85% of the items that are produced is for the cat item! I had all 100 energy and counted, 85% was for the cat and we all know the energy lasted for 2 min before I was out and only have created cat items! ü§¨ All these reviews talk about how fast they go through energy but yet nothing has been done about that! They just really want you to spend $ on the game and I refuse to do that!!! | I really love this game but it‚Äôs getting too expensive to play.  I‚Äôve spent over $100 to buy gems and energy so I can continue playing! Can‚Äôt you give us more ways to earn gems and energy? I can‚Äôt afford to pay to play anymore especially when I don‚Äôt win anything! So please give us more ways to earn gems etc so we can continue playing and for longer. Thank you. | It was fun for the first 6 levels but I don‚Äôt have any space on my board to add new things to merge, and can‚Äôt merge anything currently on the board. No way to delete anything on the board or to reset, so deleting is my only option. | i want more life‚Äôs | I get the concept and it has great potential. Ill admit, I‚Äôm only playing to get points for another app, but I only choose the games I think I would like. This one just has too much. It‚Äôs all moving along nicely until about level 14, then you have to match and match and match and match just for 1 item for 1 person - and the box you really need to level up has very limited items and very seldom comes up. So, you just keep matching and matching and matching and matching then you run out of energy (which I do understand that, that‚Äôs the wait part of the game), or, more annoying than that, the box your working from (2day now) has to pause and recharge. It has potential but right now, it‚Äôs just too much. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm going to finish for my points, I‚Äôm seriously thinking about just deleting it already. | I downloaded the game to acquire an amount of dice rolls for monopoly go, I completed the tasks expecting my reward to be applied to no avail. I reached out to customer service and kept being told to load the same game and redo the requirements and maybe it will unlock the reward. This is ridiculous and a complete waste of people‚Äôs time smh. | I couldn‚Äôt even dig out the beginning so I deleted it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Adds try to take your money and is pretty good | If you choose to watch a video, it plays, then nothing!! DOES NOT go back to the game!!  Only way out is to completely exit the game.  ENOUGH!! Think twice about getting this one üëéüèª | No stress, yet! | I was really enjoying this game until I was overcharged for a package I purchased for the SECOND TIME! Not just once, but twice. They have taken over $30 from me without anything in the game in return. This is a huge problem when I‚Äôm looking at spending $8 but $25 comes out of my account!! | Very good | Fun but costly.  Sad I enjoyed the game | I am addicted to this game. I love it and I am too grown for games. However, without in-app purchases, you can only go so long playing the game before you don‚Äôt have enough resources to. The prices for the in-app purchases are unreasonable. If they were lowered, more people would actually pay for them including myself. | I‚Äôve loved this game to wind down and relax. However I went to play today and it‚Äôs frozen and won‚Äôt load past 35%. I don‚Äôt want to lose my progress but I‚Äôm disappointed I will probably have to delete the game. | I really enjoyed playing this game until now. The refresh activates when I tap and fill in only 9 spaces. That gets really aggravating. I‚Äôm on level 29. This game didn‚Äôt do that on earlier levels b | Fun game, BEWARE, if you don‚Äôt spend money you can only play for about 5 minutes every 2 hours. | Used to love this game and spent alot of money on this game. The last three or four times that i have bought a mega pack it charges me twice. I buy a pack and it lasts me 4 or 5 days but my bank account is saying i am being charged 2 days in a row. 1 charge and 1 pending of the same mega pack. I have complained to the platform and to apple to no avail. I have my bank statement to show proof!! Will not be buying anything else within this game, it is a ripoff!!!!! | The game is enjoyable at first, but after a couple of levels you can‚Äôt really play more than a minute with out purchasing just so you can play. There are other games where purchasing is always optional yet you still can play and enjoy yourself. | I really enjoy the game play but it is an EXPENSIVE MONEY GRAB. You run out of energy multiple times before you can achieve what is needed and it costs to get more energy just to waste it on things not needed to ‚Äúsell‚Äù to your customers. For example, if you need to build a sand castle- the bucket will keep giving you rocks and pebbles like 20x before you get one part of the sand castle and you‚Äôve wasted energy. I‚Äôve been playing for a 3 days and have already spent $20 and I‚Äôm done. I will not put another penny in this game. Please review the gameplay and make it fair and not about money!!! | personally.. i didn't like it at all. didn't even get through the tutorial. it's long and boring. | I was really enjoying this game until this most recent challenge: the rabbit sticker is taking so much of my energy and idk why it‚Äôs doing that or how to avoid it so that was a waste of my money buying extra energy so I could play a game I was really enjoying for a longer time period. I really wish I could just buy the energy and use it. I don‚Äôt have the double energy thing selected on my game so that‚Äôs not why that‚Äôs happening. Without something in game explaining why this is happening, I have to assume the game is scamming me to buy more energy and then just taking extra for no reason so I have to wait or buy more :( | Garbage game watch the ads and don't add stamina! | I LOVE this game 60% of the time but HATE it the other 40 % of the time.
The game is so fun when you are really into it, but then the fun comes to an immediate halt (unless of course you‚Äôre willing to pay for more fun)!  I don‚Äôt do that because that‚Äôs the beginning of a whole other problem.  
You have to work so hard to earn a measly 2 üíéand don‚Äôt get me started on the ‚ö°Ô∏è!üò°
Granted, I will continue playing especially now that Fetch (Receipt scanning app) gives you MEGA points for playing the game.
The game is worth downloading because it‚Äôs insanely fun, but just know that the fun comes to a fast end when you run out of ‚ö°Ô∏è. | The game is fun and all but a mini game should be added to pass time so energy can be restored | I downloaded this game after playing it briefly in the trial game. As with many of these games when you download them, it is no where close to what is shown in the commercials between games.  There should be something done about this. The same with Royal Watch and Triple Match. | I love this game but on the level 48 where the rabbit shows as energy there‚Äôs two in the same spot, I have to use anywhere between 1-6 diamonds for it to give me a new sticker.  I feel like since it‚Äôs ten levels to get get bonuses I‚Äôve been cheated out of money and diamonds so if I was you don‚Äôt play that double bunny until the app makers guaranteed you it‚Äôs fixed.  Other than that it‚Äôs okay. | When I buy packages it charges me double!! I need my money back!! | I have bought extra energy for this game for about six months and just realized that I am being overcharged for each purchase. My fault for trusting an unknown app. Deleting today and on level 75. Charging it to my stupidity and trusting Apple to vet their developers. | This game is fun, but the probability rates and other game design aspects can be extremely frustrating to the point where I quit the game from time to time. Here are a few suggestions I have. The stars indicate changes that I believe would make the most sense for both users and the developers. 

‚≠êÔ∏è - make it easier to make friends and trade cards in the app, i don‚Äôt like having to friend random people on facebook

- ability to trade more than 2 cards a day

- tweak the probability of getting new cards from packs. I have seen complaints from people who have spent loads of money to get zero new cards, which i imagine would be extremely demoralizing. I have had a similar experience, i don‚Äôt spend money for cards but i frequently open 3-6 packs in a row and get no new cards

‚≠êÔ∏è - more opportunities to watch ads for rewards. I understand the developers need to make money, but some of the requests are a bit ridiculous and it‚Äôs extremely difficult to progress without spending money

- if the above suggestion is untenable, decrease the amount of time it takes to refill energy

‚≠êÔ∏è - have an option to sell duplicates of golden cards, like getting a mystery box, exchanging for a three star card pack, or coins/diamonds

- view the refresh time when a producer is recharging

- see how much xp for a given upgrade

- see how much xp is needed to level up

Thank you for reading, and i hope some of these changes will be implemented to create a better balance between frustration and enjoyment in the game. | This game is fun and relaxing to play. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how the system is forcing players to join in the tournaments. This will lead to me playing less than I did. I don‚Äôt want to join nonstop tournaments and I doubt others do too. | I fell in love with this game very quickly and have even spent money (more than I would like to admit) on it‚Ä¶ but I am losing interest because there are certain things that you end up wasting too much energy trying to get.  One example‚Ä¶ I need palm trees to make certain items, yet I get a piece of the palm tree only like one time in every 20 to 40 clicks, so I am having to waste so many lightening bolts on things I don‚Äôt need.  The same thing happens with savory foods, sculpture pieces, surf clothing, etc‚Ä¶ if this doesn‚Äôt get better, I‚Äôm probably done with the game because 100 lightening bolts get used up too fast so, unless you spend a ton of money, you can only play for a few minutes at a time. | no matter how much money or how much time you spend, they never give you the card collection rewards‚Ä¶. i‚Äôm at 8/9 on 7 different packs. i‚Äôm over this game if you can‚Äôt make it fair | First off, I love Travel Town and I have been playing it for about 2 years and I am on level thirty. My one and only complaint is about the amount of energy given. 100 energy is too little for the game. I can spend 100 energy in less than 2 minutes. Most of the time when playing I run out of energy before even completing an order. It gets pretty annoying too and it stops the player from actually getting to play the game. I hope this gets fixed in the next update. I also hope Travel Town comes out with more mini versions for holidays like they used to. Those were the most fun for me. | They don‚Äôt give you enough energy and you will end up having to pay money to play you will never win without spending money. | I‚Äôve never been really big on merging games but, so far, this one has been surprisingly relaxing. So far so good that‚Äôs why I put 5 stars. | Me gusta mucho este juego y lo juego todos los d√≠as pero desde hace dos d√≠as que no me deja entrar, ya reinicia el celular y el Internet para ver si no era mi tel√©fono pero todav√≠a no se arregla, me sale que est√° cargando y se queda en 37% y no avanza de ah√≠ por m√°s que espero, No puedo desinstalar e instalar el juego ya que por desgracia no lo conect√© a ninguna Red social o correo as√≠ que lo perder√≠a todo , No s√© si est√°n teniendo problemas en el sistema o qu√© pero si lo arreglan cambiar√© mi rese√±a y le pondr√© cinco estrellas. | I love this game, however 100 coins to play with‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt get you very far. Most times I can‚Äôt even finish a task. I can‚Äôt keep throwing money at it. It‚Äôs not only disappointing but also frustrating. Can this not be upped by 100 coins at least? | constantly gets stuck loading at 37%. when it does load, the advertisements glitch. takes days to finish one task once you get to the higher levels. | You get VERY LITTLE energy for free before the game prompts you to purchase more. Not worth the space on my phone. | This game is so addictive. I just can‚Äôt get enough lightning strikes for life. | First it continued to ask me to log into Facebook every single time I opened the app. Now it won‚Äôt even load.

And this app supposedly wins awards. AWESOME | Is the best. No more circling the airport real time take off and landings!! | Best app | Reassurance re flight times depart and arrival | Very helpful when I p/u family member from SNA | Con esta aplicaci√≥n no pierdo tiempo esperando en el aeropuerto porque s√© exactamente cuando salen y cuando llegan los vuelos, si est√° atrasado y por cu√°nto tiempo, mejor imposible. | Is getting less useful all the time. I use this app to track arriving flights for people I‚Äôm going to meet at the airport. But needless notifications days in advance are nothing but an annoyance.  Ads run each time after a flight is added to be tracked, which is fine and assumed on the free version. The problem comes when the ads  are obvious scams. And lately, the ads have been so long that you have to just shut the app down and reopen it if you want to continue. | Flight Tracker is very precise in tracking all flights including their departures, enroute and arrivals | Like this app. It‚Äôs got everything I want with flight schedules and radar views | The last few flights I tracked this app was way off & take off & landing times. As I write this my daughter is sitting on the ru way at Tampa 14th in line to take off. App says it took off 45 min ago. FIX THIS PLZ! | I found my flight in under 10 minutes | I just can‚Äôt make it work for Ethiopian airlines specially the local ones it doesn‚Äôt track it at all | Love how it keeps us updated and the small details such as baggage claim numbers | Even though I had to pay for no ads and live tracking, it is very accurate! I'm going to Vegas and I had a layover. I put my flight number and it was 100% accurate. Best flight tracker I've ever used! | I do not like this app and want to cancel it. 
Thank you | Tech support was very responsive, and corrected the issues in a timely manner. Flights are easy to search, and display the correct dates. Departure and Arrival times appear to be updated quickly and accurately. I‚Äôm very satisfied with this app! ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî I subscribe to the Pro version of this app, which used to work well. As of at least yesterday, 1/21/2024, every search for an an Alaska Airlines flight results in ‚ÄúNo Flights Found.‚Äù I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, with no change. Like much of the nation, we‚Äôre under very nasty weather conditions, so I was hoping this app would keep me advised of flight status. Time to look elsewhere. | Flight Tracker is a wonderful app and I use it all the time for business and personal travel. 

However, before the app will ADD a flight to my calendar, it wants full access to my calendar. A flight app should be able to add a flight to a calendar without full access to my private, daily schedule. I should be able to select the option, ‚Äúadd events only‚Äù without impacting my privacy. Thank you. | Super | I love this application | I‚Äôve never written a negative review. I‚Äôm of the opinion if you don‚Äôt like something don‚Äôt use it an move on. This app pushed me to my breaking point. 
I‚Äôve used this app for several years. Loved the ease of use and accuracy. However, since I don‚Äôt travel a ton the only paid option at 50.00/year doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. The ads last about a minute each and you need to watch one or two between adding any new information. This is particularly aggravating while your literally at an airport and trying to get information quickly. Sadly, I‚Äôm going to search for a new app as it‚Äôs become incredibly frustrating and unfun to use. | Have used this app for many years. The new version is horrible. I finally deleted it; it is useless to me. | I just paid for real-time tracking. It told me the flight had already taken off and showed the plane over the water on the map. Then I got a text from our son saying they were still in the runway and there was a maintenance issue. 
Really misleading and dishonest app. | Within five minutes my screen was taken over with a full page ad to ‚Äòfree up space‚Äô ‚Ä¶ and I could not figure out how to get rid of it. No ‚Äòx‚Äô to hit. Only an opportunity to free up space. So I got out and deleted the app. | Flight Tracker reported that my sons plane left on time at 12:45. It‚Äôs 2:50 and plane is still at gate delayed over 2 hrs. So much for updates. | No flights are shown after the last update two years ago. Before this update the app sas üëçüëçüëçüëç. So please fix the issue please. | App stopped tracking flights two days ago. Getting little help from customer service. Was using paid app version. Very frustrating. | Amazing app helps tracking and getting stuff together also you know what time everything is | Very useful app highly recommended | Stop showing flights | Interface is far worse than Flightaware. No ability to find where your jet is currently. Dumped it | Flight Tracker is amazing and so accurate!! | When you only fly once or twice a year and annoying. | Everything gets monetized.
Gone from my apps. | I've been using the Flight Tracker app for years now, and it's been great. It's reliable, easy to use, and has some really useful features. The TripIt integration is a game changer. Overall, I have no complaints ‚Äì this is a must-have for those who fly a lot. | I never seen any of us before and now I have now because you‚Äôre tracking were so good that I literally just saw an airbus A380 and it was so cool and huge. Your tracking told me where it was and where it was located. | This application is not compatible with the new iPhone. The middle screen freezes and doesn‚Äôt go away until you uninstall. | NOBLESVILLE Indianapolis | This one is the only flight tracker that doesn‚Äôt glitch or is behind in anyway. My favorite thing is the map of each airport! Such a useful tool. If I could make a recommendation for a better app then I would have to say that if they included the map of where the baggage will be, how to get there from the arrival location and a map of where the terminal is or where the location is after baggage claim, then I will have to pay for the premium account definitely. Otherwise, the price for premium doesn‚Äôt seem worth it since the free version has everything I needed. Also, I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because the app kills my battery if I forget to close it so they should probably make it force close upon exit to fix that, the flight will still be in the recent section for easy access. | Would not recommend this app.! | I had used the app in the past and liked it. But without paying for a premium membership it‚Äôs barely useable now. Way too many ads now. | This app drained 61% of my battery within 8mins of on-screen activity. Either badly programmed or they‚Äôre scrapping data. | Constantly pops up ads and games and links to other flight tracking apps.  Provides limited useful information above what airline status app provides. | Good | The ability to track departing flights without destination has been removed.  This was the ONLY app available to do so.  Please fix this!!! | Bastante bueno , genial y f√°cil de usar ! | Thanks for providing the service. | Easy to use and very informational for Flight Tracking.   Sharing used to be well formatted emails family & friends could read, but the latest update to share flight is severely lacking and forces others to use the app.  If they revert back to previous functionality, would rate this a 5-Star | You need to buy the subscription to use it. |

Well done..‚úÖüëç | Finally an accurate account of our Southern California weather! | Appreciate what the Weather Channel App brings. The forecast now and upcoming. Depend on it for planning for daily activities today and upcoming. My thanks! | Not a big fan of this latest version for iPad. You are stuck viewing in only one orientation and the radar takes up way too much space on the page.  Finding weather news or viewing other geographic areas is not easy. I may have to cancel my premium subscription if this is the best that you can do. | Great app to go to when your on the go, helps with advance travel as well as family outings. Reccomend it! | With the new update, the Apple Watch app disappeared. Why??? | Has always been my favorite weather app. Tryed accu weather and went back! | Great videos Great weather reporting Great alerts and warnings Great access to hourly and daily forecasts

Good to have a good forecast even to make selection of what to wear. | Watching The Weather Channel has become a part of my daily routine to keep updated with the latest weather news. Global warming coverage helps to confirm to me that God‚Äôs plan is in motion for planet Earth as prophesied‚Ä¶conditions will be getting worse before they get better but they WILL get better. Don‚Äôt believe me, believe your Bible‚Ä¶and keep watching The Weather Channel. | Bring old weather channel back!!!!! | I dont get why this is so difficult. You are the only app I have to view horizontally. We still can see the ads if that is your problem. | While the information is very clear and useful, the app is very clunky and freezes often. In addition it always reloads. I like the app, but it definitely needs some work to refresh these bugs. | 9.9999 % of the time Weather Channel forecasts better than our local channel üëç | Something I can count on! Thank you üòä | Loved your old format. This one‚Äôs not as easy to navigate quickly. | I have my temperature units set to Imperial and yet I still get notifications of temperature changes in celsius. No way to change it‚Ä¶.so frustrating. | Weather prediction today is worse than it was 20 years ago! And now we have to watch ads to get inaccurate data?! What a joke, weather prediction is terrible! | Do not like the default landscape view of the new app. Should present in portrait view much like iPhone version. Please fix it. | It use to be a decent app!Now there are more  ads than weather!! The app is only in horizontal mode and is very glitchy. I now hate this app! Ads appear that take up whole screen and constantly pop up.The radar screen starts at a normal pace then suddenly moves so fast that you can‚Äôt see what is on screen. I think their goal was to make people so angry so they will subscribe to premium. Wrong, I am looking for another weather  app. | The bottom menu hangs up & I have act like I‚Äôm going to close the app to get to another menu item. I really hate this update and will probably go back to using Apples weather app since is just one of my many complaints submitted. | I love this app because I know what is going to happen and the worst her and if I might have a snow day lol and it has a radar so officiant. | I do like all the new features. I do like that dark mode was added. I will renew . Thank You, had for many years. Top notch | I‚Äôd like the previous versions of the weather channel app, but this current version is slow to load. It often takes up to a minute to open, and often times out. When I try to switch from Maps to radar, etc., it takes 20 or 30 seconds to switch. I use an iPhone and had no problems at all with previous versions. | I‚Äôve had the Weather Channel App for years and this last big update is junk. The app had gotten so bloated with video and ads, it‚Äôs painfully slow to open and trying to find the information you‚Äôre looking for takes forever. I‚Äôm canceling my premium subscription and looking for another straight-forward source. | Still waiting for updates, especially for iPads.  As of now, it‚Äôs not user/senior friendly.  Map takes up 2/3rds of the iPad.   The rest is only 1/3, and very difficult to navigate.  I was hoping the update a few days ago would correct it all.  But it didn‚Äôt.  No way to personalize it‚Ä¶.that I can see.  Now I‚Äôm using other apps.  This is ridiculous. | Since this new version there's no more Apple Watch app. What's  the story? | The new update has caused us to hate it so much, we have deleted it. The notifications go off so much for the littlest things, that you can‚Äôt trust whether it‚Äôs something serious. We have adjusted the notifications section to just about nothing and still get the same warning going off many times throughout the day for maybe just a frost warning. We had this app for years until now. So sad. | It is so hard to assume you know what Mother Nature and can assume what will happen with it from one hour till the next! Thanks for doing an awesome job! ü§ì | Ads in the app make it very clunky to use.  Stalls frequently and at times is unusable.  I typically now use fox weather or the apple weather first.  Now and then will use this app to see if it‚Äôs the same.  It‚Äôs almost unusable at times | Where is the running outlook? It was easy to find on the other app but I can‚Äôt find it on the new version. | Terrible redesign that forces landscape mode only. Just horrible design decision. Please revert to prior version. | It used to be such a great app and now the pop up ads and demands to upgrade to premium I have stopped using it. Every time you scroll or go to change pages within the app all the content is blocked by some form of ad and it‚Äôs EXHAUSTING just trying to check the forecast. | I liked the old app and it was easy and fast to find the info I needed. I understand that apps change over time, but these changes are supposed to improve things, not take away. TWC‚Äôs new app will not stay logged into my account and it doesn‚Äôt even offer an option to stay logged in or offer Face ID. I am paying for a premium subscription so that I can receive hourly weather data for an extended period. I waste more time logging in just so that I can view this info. The previous app stayed logged in and never gave me any problems. I now find myself using the app less and less and wish I hadn‚Äôt paid to renew my annual subscription. Why have an account if it doesn‚Äôt stay logged in? Please fix this!! | This update genuinely crippled the app. The widget feature just doesn‚Äôt work anymore. If I try to load anything other than the default city it gets stuck in a loading screen of death. I‚Äôm surprised you published this update without doing more thorough tests because it ruined the app. | Placed two email supports for two different problems and 10 days later no response. I find this unacceptable for a premium pro customer. Cancelling my subscription and will not renew. | iPad only side view . App will not rotate to how you hold iPad. Not sure what the rest of app is for . Just use apple weather. I wish I could give this zero stars . Even with this update still broken views on iPad ! | Always logging me out and have to sign back in very annoying, don‚Äôt mind the new layout it‚Äôs pretty | Ever since the GUI revamp/update, the app is extremely slow and laggy. Put it back to how it used to be. It worked perfectly before. | However there are times when the app freezes up. And at times it‚Äôs slow to open. And can you slow down the radar a bit? | This app pushes a lot of propaganda. I like the app for the weather information it provides. But it also pushes the lefts agenda and we already get it everywhere else. Just leave the weather app out of it please. | Just an incredible amount of info in a precise clear format. Took me awhile to figure out the navigation thing. But now, I feel like I could be the next new weather person on the Weather Channel. Lol | New UI is poorly designed and just feeds you ads. Also has been lagging and unresponsive when I am just trying to get the weather. | Bring back the old weather channel. This ‚Äúupdated‚Äù app is glitchy, full of ads and ridiculous. How am I supposed to see if I have a tornado warning in the area to keep my family safe and a subway ad starts playing? Bring back what worked! | This app gets worse with every update. It's cluttered with adds, you attempt to click on something and a new add opens and you click on wrong stop because the screen has shifted. | Pressing on parts of the screen no longer works due to the continuous amount of ads.

Current update made the buttons no longer functional. | DO NOT RECOMMEND The Weather Channel app has been hot and cold for as long as I have used it. I‚Äôm not sure who actually asks for the changes that are made but I doubt it is us as users. Most recently I noticed that the snow fall totals for my location have off by as much as 10-12 inches too high. I have no idea where they are pulling data because NWS does not show these crazy high amounts (this weekend I got 4‚Äù measured and app said 16). I have lost patience and will just invest in a home weather station and since I can‚Äôt trust local I can‚Äôt trust destination data so I will delete this junk. | The update as of March 26,2024 is just horrible.  It‚Äôs take longer to load and the screen is so crowded. You might want to think about the old saying ‚Äú if it‚Äôs not broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äù | Before the update there was a feature were you can see if it was ok to go running but after the update it‚Äôs no where to be found | Dont support greed don‚Äôt risk your life or families having to jump a paywall when you need weather information most! NWS is a government run entity that uses our military to gain necessary and life saving weather data that every news station and third party use as well they just reskin it and sell it back to you.

Be careful with these scammers also the email and phone number that is provided does not work. | This company is completely a scam! Do not purchase their PRIME membership! The website and app don‚Äôt work as intended and customer service is a just a joke! Only if I could give them a negative star‚Ä¶ | A month and a half I bought flight tickets using this app, the airline cancelled my flight, I submitted the request to get a refund and still haven't received my money back. How is this possible? I sent proofs of the refund that the airline sent to edreams and I haven't received an answer. Tired of this! I will never use this service again! Scam!

Update 03/22/24: after 35 days I'm still waiting for my money. The airlines confirmed the money was refunded, but edreams won't give me money back with just excuses and excuses. Scam! | Good | Excellent app and very convenient, find the shipper deals for traveling not only in airfare but also in hotels | Good | Faced a real logistical challenge with a late notice work opportunity.
Nowhere else would I have found the deal that I did from Helsinki to Santiago to San Francisco | No usen esta aplicaci√≥n, ya que hace su reserva le descuentan en dinero y a √∫ltima hora no puedes viajar por que ellos no confirman sino hasta que ellos digan y quieran . | üíï | Great | Great app. Fast and efficient | Convenient | Good | A horrible company!!!! They have repeatedly promised me a refund yet provided us with no support and have made no attempts to satisfy my request despite me doing it only 10 minutes after the purchase of the tickets. Every customer service representatives proceeded to be highly unhelpful and showed complete disregard for my concerns. They tried to refer me to the airline that the tickets were purchased from (which is idiotic to say the least, a 3rd party is supposed to make things easier but instead of I am doing their job to receive my money). They also refused to refund me for the options that I haven‚Äôt used which only further complicated the whole process. I requested a refund on March 10th and 10 days later there was still no change and my money still weren‚Äôt given back. A horrible and unprofessional service makes EDreams perhaps the worst third party company that you can refer to when trying to purchase airline tickets, you will be better off buying them off a shady guy in the back alley (He might provide better customer support if I am being frank). 1/5 stars does not begin to show how badly I am disappointed and how much headache they‚Äôve caused me. Avoid them like the plague! | I have had to call 3 times because of my error. Each time my problem was resolved quickly. The customer representatives all have been knowledgeable and extremely helpful. | Do not pay any type of insurance with this travel agency, it is useless, you cannot change your flight and there is no telephone or chat with people who can resolve and assist you with the additional service you paid for, it is always better to buy directly with The airline. | Muy buena debe mantenerse as√≠ | I booked a flight internationally within different cities and wanted to change so I could stay an extra day and enjoy the city. Wrong was I. Their customer service is nonexistent so when I rebooked and changed I had to ‚Äúwait for approval‚Äù to change my flight. Maybe that‚Äôs a thing abroad but not in the US. My flight change was never approved nor was it denied and my original flight came and went. Additionally, I ‚Äúnever got the approval‚Äù by the time of the rebooked flight either. Luckily I could tell when literally no one answered me that I needed to this on my own. Which I know means that ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù to change my flight will still be charged even though they did nothing and actually hurt the user experience trying to enjoy their travel. DO NOT USE, especially if there could be changes to your travels. | Come in handy for last minute trips | E dreams were very good. I would recommend booking a flight with this app. It kept me informed, and on time for my flights would use again. Highly recommend. | Can‚Äôt get the boarding pass | Like | Love | BEST DISCOUNT APP.

It helpful to have a packing list - otherwise something is left behind. | I have packing anxiety and I avoid trips because packing stresses me out to the point of a mental breakdown üòÜ I wish I was joking, but alas I am not‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôve been using this for about 5 minutes and have high hopes that I can pack without crying and thinking about canceling last minute. | I use PackPoint for all of my trip no matter if it is a weekend getaway or longer vacation.  It helps me get all of my thoughts regarding packing organized and make it an easier task. | Great program.  Makes my packing easy!!  Love it. | My friend just turned me onto this app and I‚Äôm obsessed! So simple, and customizable. SUPER user friendly! | This app is amazing! I have always been known as an over packer, and this app helps me make sure that I don‚Äôt over pack. It also lets me know what I should pack. I love that I can put in where I am going, when I am going, and how long I am staying for my VC. This app is awesome! I definitely recommend getting it. This app, I think, can be used by any age group, whether it is younger, teenagers, young adults, mid adults, and even elders can use this. This app has saved me from over packing. So, I rate this app, 5 stars! 5Ô∏è‚É£‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | This app really helped organize our packing for our trip. Highly recommended | Uses the weather and activities to build a packing list | Where in the world and for how long? Use this and Timeshifter all the time. | This app is a life saver! | Very helpful | Upgraded to the paid version, but still would like additional customization options. Would love to be able to hide categories I‚Äôm never going to use (motorcycling, hiking, business formal, etc.) and have the ability to adjust the order of items in a list and the order of the categories within the list. | As someone who packs for 14 days for a weekend trip, I needed this like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. It‚Äôs a lot better than me trying to put notes in my phone for sure. On the way to the airport with one whole different bag than what I started with! | I can‚Äôt find a way to contact customer support through the app, so unfortunately, I‚Äôm having to write it in a review with hopes that somebody who can help me reads it. I‚Äôve got premium of this app, and I‚Äôve tried to connect it to Tripit. Because I use a Google sign in for Tripit there is no way to connect the two apps as it only has login and password as options, not the Google logo. I have to go through full site, but the apps won‚Äôt connect if I go that way. I only got Tripit, because of this app, and I really don‚Äôt want to enter all my trip information again | It is too easy to accidentally delete items on the list. All you have to do is touch them and it‚Äôs gone. So if you don‚Äôt know what you touched then you have to go through the list and try to think of it again. | Developers have been unresponsive to multiple emails | I create activities for each of the types of trips I take. I keep many of my toiletries and electronics permanently packed, but it gives me reassurance to compare my ready-to-go carryon with my lists. | Such a great app so helpful for packing ‚ù§Ô∏è | Love it, very helpful | Love using this app to pack! It uses the weather and you‚Äôre activities to create the lists.  Reminded me of items I would have forgotten like hats and other specifics. | PackPoint is a great app. It helps me make sure I have everything I need it‚Äôs almost like a shopping list for packing. You can edit it easily add things and it really just make sure you have everything you want for your trip. It also check the weather so if you‚Äôre going to a rainy place, for example, it make sure that you have the option to pack rain gear. | I love it I don‚Äôt have to think or take the risk to forget some thing | Ok this app is literally a life saver. I am going to Hawaii soon and I had no idea where to start packing. GET THIS APP ITS SO SLAY | There you have it. You deserve it. | Most acceptable one I can find in the App Store for now but lacking some basic features.  I wish I can sort or alphabetize the list, edit the master, to begin with.  And why can I type in wherever I am going? For example, no San Jose, CA? Only San Francisco. | Yet another Packing List app where I‚Äôm required to put in my destination. I just want to make a list and use it for future trips. I don‚Äôt seem to be able to do this with this app. | Pack list is simple, clean and easy to use .
It‚Äôs a great memory aid for packing . | Great starting point when preparing a trip. Saves me from racking my brain to think of the obvious | I use this app every time I travel. It is much better than my memory! | The subject line says it all. It‚Äôs simple easy to use. Not bloated with too many features. It‚Äôs exactly what I need. | I had my own list however this is much easier. | I‚Äôve been using this app pretty contentedly for years, but this week discovered that NYC somehow doesn‚Äôt come up as a possible destination? | Wedding in Sarajevo? Check.
Motorcycle riding thru West Virginia? Check.
This packing app that calculates based on weather and activities is simple, accurate and thorough. Oddly leaves off shoes (!) though. | I bought the premium version to sync my trip from TripIt so I did not have to re-enter all of my activities that were already in TripIt and could plan according to each day and activity. All it does is sync the dates of your trip which you can enter yourself on the free version. The premium version is a waste of time and money. | Suggests things I would have forgotten | Such a great way to help remember essential packing items. | Use it for every trip | Very helpful | Super helpful! Packing is overwhelming and this app keeps my mind organized! Love it | Super easy. Great way to remember to take everything you need for your trip. | Nice job with all the essentials. Very easy to use and add on if needed! | Love love love the packing lists and ability to create my own and customize existing ones. As a long time trip it user I loved the intervention but over the last year something is wrong with the trip it integration and the app always suggests past trips or wrong trips for me when being to pack. It‚Äôs a big bummer as I‚Äôm a trip it pro user. | This app it‚Äôs so helpful | Love this app. I can use the list already generated and add more items as I customize the list.  It also tracks each trip by date and location so if I have a reoccurring trip I don‚Äôt need a new list.

Packing List Checklist is an easy to use app that provides you with a checklist of all the important things to consider and pack before traveling.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî PICK SUGGESTED ITEMS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
 
Get up and running with very little effort by using our Pick Suggested Items feature.

You will be able to pick items from these categories: Essentials, Accessories, Baby, Backpack / Carry On, Beach, Camping, Clothing, Electronics, Food, Healthcare, Makeup, Shoes, Toiletries and many more!

That's it: your list will be ready without any typing involved!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî SYNC YOUR LISTS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
 
Created your list on your iPad but want to check it on your iPhone? Got a new iOS device and want to see your lists there?

With iCloud sync we've got you covered: your lists will be with you on all your iOS devices as long as you are using the same Apple ID in them.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî SET REMINDERS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Want to make sure that you are not leaving anything behind? Just set up a reminder, get a notification at the right time and relax!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî MANAGE ITEM QUANTITIES ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
 
Set the quantities for your Packing List items.
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî TO DO & TO PACK ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
 
After a lot of research we reached the conclusion that the best way to go through your travel preparation is to distinguish the actions that you need to take before and during travel from the things that you need to pack.
 
That‚Äôs why each list has two sections: To-Do & To Pack.
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî CREATE YOUR OWN CATEGORIES ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
 
Organize your items by grouping them into different categories.
You will be able to create as many categories as you need, and you can pick an emoji to better differentiate them.
 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî REUSE YOUR EXISTING LISTS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
 
This is one of the best kept secrets of every seasoned traveller. Keep refining your list, and reach sorcerer-level packing skills. You‚Äôll soon forget why you ever packed for your travels differently in the past!

So easy and perfect for any packing !!!!!! | I loved this app, but after my last update, it no longer opens. So frustrating to pay for an app that doesn‚Äôt get updated. 

Apple should require developers to indicate a commitment to updates so users know which are worth the investment. 

I‚Äôm happy to change my review if the app is updated. I‚Äôve lost years of well-developed lists. No longer a happy customer. | Have used it many times. Love the layout. Very clear, simple. Like the flexibility of changing items, duplicating lists, making new lists, categorization of items | Wish I had found this earlier | I got my new iPhone and now it won‚Äôt even open. There are no new updates available so I guess I have lost all my precious lists | Had to reinstall to new iPhone, previous purchase not restored and they forced me to buy the app again!  Use another packing list app.  This one is not worth the frustration! | Nice app but the delete/trash can icon doesn‚Äôt work which super annoying. | Nice app, but lists I create on my phone are not showing up on my iPad. | I loved this app, but after upgrading to iOS 17 it no longer works, just crashes immediately. | I just upgraded to premium but I can‚Äôt find out how to use the extra features. | So far its fantastic | This app was great. It worked well, was easy to use, and was free. But I just got an iPhone 14 and now I can‚Äôt open it. | Paid premium and now it doesn‚Äôt work and app is completely shut down. So much for lifetime access. | This app, which I used faithfully for years and even purchased premium features on, appears to no longer be supported. With the new IOS update the app will no longer open. | After looking for awhile I finally found this app.  I really like how I can make & keep my lists.  Simplify‚Äôs my life so much . | Great app. Easy to use. Worked well until I got a new iPhone 14. Now it won‚Äôt open. | How do I synch my iphone from my iPad? Don‚Äôt see any instructions. | Purchasing the new Apple 15 Pro Max made a number of my purchased apps not work any longer; especially my list for packing with Triplist. It also allowed the weather app to work with it so I know what type of clothing to bring. They didn‚Äôt keep it up but I at least had my dates of my trips and my list of items needed for each trip. Then it made it so that wouldn‚Äôt work, and I had to delete it along with all my trips, dates, and where I went along with the weather. I would love this app to follow in its place.  I would like to be able to personalize this app a little bit like put in background picture of each trip and add the weather even if it‚Äôs in Europe, etc. But I‚Äôm happy I found some thing that works so I don‚Äôt forget important items. | I absolutely love this app and have used it for years now. Favorite features include being able to duplicate checklists and/or pick items from other ones; customize to-do‚Äôs; add emojis to categories and easily make changes to categories; uncheck all items if using the same list. It‚Äôs super user-friendly and flexible. | I‚Äôve been using it for a few years and love the ability to copy from one trip to another to create a new list, the ability to share lists with someone else who‚Äôs on the pro version, and overall its versatility. Highly recommend. | I really love this app. Definitely worth upgrading. It‚Äôs easy to use and syncs across iOS devices. We have different packing lists for different types of trips. And for backpacking we breakdown what goes where in our packs. Wish list: web or max interface. List sharing with your packing partner. | I was ashen when this app started collapsing at start.  Assumed I had lost all my lists.

Came to check the reviews, see if other people were having the same issue.  

Someone said they deleted and reinstalled.  
Tried it, and all is good again.  

When in doubt, unplug and plug it back in, right?

Data was stored in the cloud, so I didn‚Äôt lose anything there. | Worked ok for what it was for a while- now all my lists are lost because the app crashes whenever i open it. User beware- you‚Äôll want to back everything up if you use this. | Love this app that stopped working on my iPhone. Luckily worked on iPad. After much frustration I installed on iPhone and reinstalled and it now works!!  So glad to have this fabulous app that I‚Äôve relied on for years working again! | Love this app but it isn‚Äôt opening on my phone? What‚Äôs going on??? | I have several checklists and packing lists stored in this app. Now I can‚Äôt even open it. Can you please at least update the app so we can export our lists rather than losing them entirely? | It no longer backs up or even syncs to iCloud like it used to do. Total disappointment. | I‚Äôve checked for updates and there‚Äôs none. When I click on the app and goes back to my home screen. Not even working. | Got a new iPhone and now the app will not open at all | Getting ready for trip and tired of forgetting something so looked for a packing list app. Downloaded a bunch, paid and free. Some too confusing, some way to basic. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot, or do a subscription. This had a very reasonable one-time fee. Installed on both iPad & iPhone. Made my first list on my iPad, and when I opened the app on my phone, my list was there, instantaneously! Really impressed! | I‚Äôve been using this to keep track of stuff in our camper.  I have 2 sun-headings of each location: one is the stationary provisions (what I have bought or need to buy for that ‚Äúroom‚Äù), and the second is the high dollar or perishable items that need to be transported back and forth. I use different icons for each room for at a glance comprehension and feet icon for the transfer stuff.   It‚Äôs helped me a ton with all the little things you forget otherwise (cleaners that are stored at home to over-winter, Vitamix, tools, staples like sugar, etc)!
Biggest drawback is haven‚Äôt figured out how to keep the list synched between hubby‚Äôs and my phone. | Can copy and paste lists, specify numbers of items (e.g. 2 t-shirts). Can look at all items in a list or only those items not yet packed. Very useful. | Aplicativo muito simples e intuitivo. Ajuda com tarefas simples e mant√©m minha cabe√ßa no lugar na prepara√ß√£o de uma viagem ou evento. Interface limpa e bem pensada, sem propagandas aparecendo do nada e tudo muito simples. | I love the Pack app! I bought it in 2021 to help me pack for a girls‚Äô trip with my besties. I‚Äôve used it countless times more for other trips like to go to Disney World, on cruises, road trips to see family, and weekend getaways. You can either have one primary list for every trip and just check off the things you won‚Äôt need and go from there, or you can create separate lists for the different kinds of trips you take and who you have going with you, if you need to pack for them. Gone are the days of buying shampoo and conditioner at the resort gift shop (ugh, so expensive) or my son going commando because I forgot to pack his underwear (oops). Then, there are checklists for all the to-do things before the trip. Shave your winter legs (LOL), wax the eyebrows, set up transportation at the destination of flying‚Ä¶ Extremely helpful! Pack is the best reminder app of all. | App used to open and now it doesnt | Used to love this but now it doesn‚Äôt even open any more. Sad to see. | There‚Äôs no way to create an account. The app kept crashing on iPhone. Had to delete and download again. All lists are gone - hours and hours of work‚Ä¶ | Used it for years and loved it. Recently it quit opening on both my iPhone and iPad and won‚Äôt open on my wife‚Äôs devices either. Bad update? | It loads again and works. | I use this for every trip. My packing lists evolve, adding things, taking things off, but I never have to start from scratch. Thank you for this fantastic tool. | I use this app for every single trip. I honestly don‚Äôt know what I did before. It‚Äôs super easy to use and works great! | The developer responded to my email about retrieving info from the cloud. I haven‚Äôt tried it because I ended up starting over. But I did appreciate the response and the effort to address my problem! Still love the app!
********
Ok I got the app to load but other reviewers are right- nothing comes back from the cloud. I had to start all over. I‚Äôll never update this app again. 
******** 
This app is so incredibly useful that I purchased premium! But I did the update and now it won‚Äôt open! üò£ | I‚Äôm glad to see an update. I use this app all the time. | No help or developer help or features. Or even email replies. Regret paying for premium. If you‚Äôre looking for a tool that, as one example, allows you to sync lists with your spouse, family, friends, the native Reminders app meets the need, whereas this app does not. A let down. Worst of all, developer is nowhere to be found. | Helps me stay so organized and I never forget anything | Great customizability and thoughtful features.  Love the ""All is Packed"" notification. My only complaint is the scrolling is a little glitchy on the pending items tab, and I think it would make more sense to remove categories that are all packed from the pending items list. | This has been my favorite packing list for several years, and it works for any trip and is very customizable.  If it synced among devices, I'd give it 5 stars.  What happened?? | LOVE, LOVE this app. Use to almost everyday.

Transportation is an integral part of urban living. Whether you ride the train, subway, bus, light rail, ferry or metro, use dockless scooters, bikes, ride-sharing like Uber or Lyft, getting the best urban mobility information is critical. Enter Moovit! Moovit provides riders with a one-stop-shop journey experience to help them get from point A to B in the easiest and most efficient way.

Moovit guides more than 930 million users in over 3400 cities throughout the world. Commuters will find updated bus and train times, transit maps, and, where available, real-time line arrivals. Locate nearby bus stops and train stations, travel with on-the-go live navigation guidance, receive get-off alerts when approaching your destination to ensure a smooth ride. That's why Moovit has been named one of the best apps of the year in 2017 by the App Store.

Moovit is your personal assistant for all your transit rides!

Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.

Ken O | No complaints | Great for travel gps information when not driving in a car. | This app help to take you from point A to point B easy to use thank you !!! | Smart and excellent gps.I recommend this to my friends and to all people I know. | Lo uso a diario. | Bus information is often unavailable | Great app | Got lost over and over. Can‚Äôt tell which way to go. Many circles. Much wasted time. And even got stuck outside late waiting on a bus that wasn‚Äôt coming. | Great app. Life saver for me. I am anxious when I travel and this bus really helps me plan my moves days ahead. It‚Äôs very easy to navigate and shows me the direct route to my destination with the number of stops  and the names of each stop leading to my own. My only issue is it is inaccurate at certain times. In my experience it seems as the It‚Äôs only based off a regular bus schedule and doesn‚Äôt account for changes during holidays, which can be frustrating. I spent one day waiting for the bus to arrive at its usual time as stated by the app. This was 5:20 am and just happened to find out from a passing traveler that it the first bus didn‚Äôt come until 7:00 that day. It would have been nice to know, since I had to pick up my daughter that morning. | Absolutely love this app! If I can hit 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è, I would ! | A grwat help to know when the bus is coming | Often times the app show the bus will be arriving in minutes but then doesn‚Äôt arrive. The app will then update with a new arrival time as if the other bus arrived. I guess we will have to pay to get a live accurate up to date estimated arrival times. | it became an add fest | Moovit knows all the bus schedules and gives the best times. It‚Äôs a great tool for getting around anywhere. | Used this during a 2 week trip in China. It is so much cheaper to use the public subway/metro systems and this app never let me down. Definitely worth the subscription!  

Apple Maps will NOT work for you in China (as of writing this review in 03/2024). This app will provide the directions for using the metro systems. | Using this app for a long time and still using it. Wish they can add how much people are on the bus. | Los autobuses no hacen sus paradas en los lugares adecuados unos les hace la parada y ellos mejor se hacen los que no lo ven a uno y aveces uno corriendo para alcanzarlos | It‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve caught the bus and I was looking for an app that would be simple to follow. This was definitely it. It not gives me options to get to my destination action but it alerts me when I‚Äôm getting close to my next stop/transfer. I‚Äôve enjoyed using it since buses have changed so much since the last time I used them. | I like the app because it gives you all types of ways to get where you need to be and most of the time is accurate.sometimes it has it glitches | Bueno | It's ads all around and subscription based when you're trying to go somewhere fast. 

Rapid Pulse is a free alternative though this app has a nicer UI if not for the ads. Atleast make it a one time purchase. | Wow, can‚Äôt live without it. If you travel you need move it.

It‚Äôs a lifesaver!! | Spinning wheel forever. Worst app in the age of chatgpt | I‚Äôve been using the app for 10 years, I travel A LOT, I adjust times, dates and activities and attractions w easy. Usually I am the lead in my groups and people are always so impressed and satisfied. I set activities that are near eachother for same day, usually hitting one region or area per day. Very seldeom I use public transport, usually all by foot and the map option allows me to plan accordingly. | I have used it all over the world, very good and helpful | The program works well, but I was unable to figure out how to list more than one hotel and use the app to plot which sites to see from each hotel site. Also 10 days is maximum. Limited in allowing you to travel between different cities on the same trip. Nice listings of attractions close to each other and offers a variety of itineraries to adapt to your plans. | Very versatile, flexible, you just choose a city and you have many options to plan accordingly. | Joan did a spectacular tour. His knowledge and perspective of both the city‚Äôs history and local color made Barcelona come alive. I definitely recommend this tour and Joan. 25 stars! | That‚Äôs the review.. just got a blanked out screen on iPhone. Tried on android the same.. bummer | This app constantly forces you back to the beginning. You‚Äôre on day one, every time you go into it you going to go through plan your trip, your plans and then sometimes it‚Äôs not your plans but the generic guide they give you constantly reloading.  In your travels this can get really expensive. Also there used to be an offline downloadable map which was amazing. | This app is amazing and it‚Äôs a staple for all of my trips. One problem is adding a stop the app doesn‚Äôt recognize. I wish we could add an address if the app doesn‚Äôt recognize it as a destination. | Freezes constantly. Every few seconds! | I consistently recommend this app to anyone I meet that tells me they are traveling to a new city! It‚Äôs incredibly easy to use and flexible. You are sure to optimize your time using it to see top attractions anywhere in the world! | I was thrilled to find this helpful site and even happier with the intuitive way it works.  I have reworked our week in London a couple times and it was easy peesy!  üòä | After long hours of working on my itinerary, I then tried to download and print.   Though it said it had emailed the itinerary to my email address, it never did.   There is no print option, when you select print it just says it emailed it.    Not what I had hoped for. | I‚Äôve used this all over the world, whether on vacation or a short business trip. Best way to be efficient and knowledgeable! | What a great place to start your planning for any trip. Offers such a variety of options and how to pace yourself. | I like the concept, but to get started it‚Äôs not user friendly. One I remember how to input everything it‚Äôs smoother | One of my favorite travel apps! | The best app ever.  It help me travelled around the world.  Everyone should have it | Truly a phenomenal idea and an amazing app. Thanks to the team. Great job. | I rate this the BEST guide to plan for visits to  any city ! It is very time- saving to visitors! | This | Friendly use | I used it in Italy, New Orleans, San Francisco and more.  It‚Äôs awesome.  Saw so much more than I would have been able to with out its direction.  Signed up for tours I never would have known about.  Fabulous! | I have used this program several son the last couple of years.  I love its ability suggest itineraries to Mach the available to see the sites | Fantastic app and I‚Äôve used it to organize and maximize many trips regardless of how long my visit will be! | Nice concept but you need to do a lot of work on this app or website. Can not edit your travel itinerary or move your plans from one day to another.
Can not add ‚Äúthings to do‚Äù from the tab into the itinerary, sends you to another site. | this app is so useful and helps so much when seeing a new place especially when it gives you a map overview of all the attractions | Love this app for city planning. | I have been looking for an app to track my trips and add places that I would like to go. This app gives me ideas by setting up itineraries for me and allows me to adjust them to fit my needs. One thing that I would like to see is the ability to change the actual times. We made reservations for dinner and I may I am not able to change the time for that particular item without adjusting the length of the time I‚Äôm at other places. | I‚Äôm just gonna say it‚Äîthe interface is kind of trash! There‚Äôs a lot of functions that would be nice, convenient, and rational to have that aren‚Äôt there, and if they ARE there, they‚Äôre not intuitive to find at all. It also gives me clunky mapquest vibes. 
But‚Äîif you like trip planning, it definitely gives you that satisfied feeling once you have your itinerary all filled out. Also, after seeing the website, the app looks a lot better. Happy traveling! | This app has been a godsend for our large family, as we have been traveling in Europe! It is a first rate idea generator, even suggesting a sensible itinerary. Not only that, but when we had difficulty with tickets from a vendor the app listed, the Cisit a City customer service stepped up to get us a refund. Exceeded my expectations! | I love looking at Visit-a-City to identify the sites in a particular location. And I have been able to find some great tours and activities to book. | We use visitacity to map out our trips.  It p provides  an easy to follow itinerary.  If you are a planner, this is the App for you. You will not be disappointed. | I love this app!I have used it for international multi country trips as well as trips within the USA. You put in the where and when and your planning is almost done for you!  I would highly recommend this app for anyone traveling whether you have kids, want to relax or go and see everything! | I admit I found it much easier to use website to plan the trip then the app.  I tried tons of travel planners and this is the best site.  Once you have the plan done, you can share it or for me being old school, I printed it for a hard copy.  There are areas it can improve on, but compared to other apps, this easy.

I had to email them with a technical support and they were awesome.  Download it and give it a try, but remember the website is easier to do the initial plan.  5 stars me is odd, but this app deserves it. | This app is awesome! I am a international flight attendant and i use it everywhere I go! | I‚Äôve used this app in several cities and have found the itineraries excellent for planning. I would recommend it to anyone | If you want a decent travel itinerary this is THE APP, an excellent app. I did the 13 days in Italy just as planned, one of the best trip ever. Thank you Visit a City !!! | This is the only app review I‚Äôve ever written, and this app has earned it.  Thank you, developers, for making this!  You‚Äôve saved me a ton of times and opened up my favorite cities in ways I didn‚Äôt expect | I love this app! Have used it for 2 trips now. I love that it gives a description of most places that are available to visit and the opening/closing times are very helpful to plan an itinerary. It‚Äôs great.",4.83587,12271,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/92/46/60/9246600a-4b7e-e027-1d01-171b02e2858a/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/00/68/d5/0068d5e5-a33c-8f47-2915-06a8fc359ead/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/45/54/6d/45546d76-18d6-04a6-4db2-a0883ecbd0f0/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8f/0e/98/8f0e986b-914b-9033-df61-30f2e675025b/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/59/69/fe/5969fe14-4ba0-f6fd-79e8-f7a723c35227/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/52/55/98/52559869-004f-781d-91a8-3146ae61c1bb/35d69598-c4b9-45e5-a688-715ddba9d84e_01.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a2/e9/65/a2e96501-041f-7bcf-2357-7d321ac28f47/dad1e9ec-073c-4719-aa75-9bd31a5915e6_02.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/19/d6/1c/19d61c84-360f-20a7-7b0e-c35aa3d3dfab/9a333c80-48a2-40e4-9616-30c4bff16f9d_03.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/da/00/5e/da005e87-e856-6518-5658-b1fdbe747ef7/ed646e62-51c0-4a95-b1c1-457728de0bc3_04.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/77/3a/04/773a043b-c234-3502-908f-d86941694dc2/6ca9456e-2c4c-4b0c-98de-f067c05b3a16_05.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Always great service and good cars . 5stars | Always courteous, very reliable and the cars are very clean . 
Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt take my money nowhere else | Reliable and dependable customer service | The staff is amazing and very helpful. | I m a member with you over 8 years.
Why expenses? | I rent from Enterprise at least 20 times a year. Customer service is always on point.  The staff goes above and beyond | It is very easy using the enterprise website, and the personal service you get when you pick up the car is also an excellent feature. I am very loyal to Enterprise at this point. | Everytime we make a reservation all people who has helped us have been very nice,Kind,Respectful and helpful the App is so Easy to make or edit reservations makes a big difference plus the prices are reasonable I would recommend them to anyone, the only down fall I seen is that if you have debit card you can‚Äôt rent a SUV you have to have a credit card which doesn‚Äôt make any since to me when you could have much more on a bank debit card then a credit Card that is one thing I definitely would ask to be changed because if you get your money then I don‚Äôt see how it matters how they receive it. | I had a miserable experience with the enterprise in Sanford / Orlando airport they literally tried to say I put a dent in the car I had gotten insurance through them and always have in case something like this happened!! It was barely visible and I was in a town home the spots were so small I know someone hit me while pulling in or out of the space beside me on the passenger side and they tried to say it was my fault anyway and that he was going to get ahold of his supervisors to note the damage and this guy was just a complete punk kid I told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been driving longer than you have been alive‚Äù and I‚Äôm 100% covered my fault or not when I get insurance through enterprise but the customer service was horrible I was so upset I left a $300 pair of sunglasses in the pop down holder and my wife left her rosary (which was given to her by her great grandmother and can not ever be replaced!) I have never had issues with any other establishment but ORL/SANFORD AIRPORT IS THE WORST!!!!!!!!! | I rented a car went through the process. So I‚Äôm 20. They called me saying they need the rental back. Because I‚Äôm 20 well yalll knew i was 20 bc yall told me i needed a valid license which i went the next day to get and to register me and put me in the system. As the week went by from the days i rented. They called me the day of rental return stating i need the car back as soon as possible because of your age. Mind you i paid $200  the morning before to make sure i could still rent. It processed through. to extend my date because my own car wasn‚Äôt done in the shop still. Nothing but a waste of money and time. Do not go here I‚Äôd rather go through Hertz | This company definitely makes miracles come true! thank you for never letting me down. | The Enterprise app is so easy and quick. I normally find many option with affordable prices | This branch is awesome there always so helpful and always take the time to walk every customer through the rental process keep being great üëçüèº | The Wheatridge location is amazing everyone there are so friendly from the manager all the way down best place ever | The team at the Avon Indiana store always go out of their way to make sure I have a great experience.

Ryan, the manager is always helpful an excellent with customer service as well as the other employees. Thanks to the gentleman an ladies at this location. I am very pleased to rent from enterprise because they make it easy and no hassle.

That means a lot. Keep up the good work. Satisfied customer. | Wonderful | They are always nice cars , reliable always clean ! Employees are friendly all are awesome !!! | I have not been able to get cars on short notice way too many times, you are forcing me to go else where. | Those guys there are A plus.. Everytime I‚Äôve rented through them ALL of them make sure everything is ok‚Ä¶ I had one mishap and I couldn‚Äôt even get mad because they made sure to take care of it | Awesome service and easy to book a reservation. Thanks guys | I love how simple and easy it is to use the app. And I always use enterprise | Customer Service Rep named Andrea was very nice and polite and guide me through each step without any problems. I wish all representatives were like her. | My name is spelled incorrectly on my account and no one can seem to fix it. | Exotics is my go too ‚Ä¶. But the courtesy i receive at all the facilities I have been to are exceptional O‚ÄôHare (Chicago) and Harry Reid (Las Vegas) have been my favorite spots ‚Ä¶.

America‚Äôs people making America Amazing. | Seamless and the staff are awesome! | I have rented from the Clay Road location in Houston, TX. Several times and am always pleased by the customer service received. Donald seems to actually working there and works hard to get me the vehicle I need. | Easy and nice | Very good customer service from the foster ave location | This is by far the easiest reservation site to navigate. | Horrible service and they don't honer the rewards system pathetic | The cars are clean | I love the staff at the Revere Hotel office. Outstanding service! | Excellent customer service | Tatum helped me out tremendously and was in and out within minutes. Thanks for the great customer service Tatum! | I am completely satisfied with Enterprise.

The speed of pick up and drop off, plus the condition of vehicles is excellent! | Didn‚Äôt like the app made the reservation but when I got there they said they didn‚Äôt have any cars.

When you try to choose the flight you‚Äôre interested in, it closes the whole thing! You start all over again, only for it to keep closing. Uninstalling right now! | I've booked numerous flights on JUSTFLY. Always been great!!  Seriously have checked other apps and even flights directly from the airlines. ALWAYS came back to JUSTFLY. They are cheaper and app is much much easier to use. | really easy to use it only took 3 minutes for me to complete my booking. | Easy procedures and competitive pricing, keep up with the good work | I wouldn‚Äôt trust this app I got scammed for 1250 dollars I haven‚Äôt been reimbursed till this day be careful with this app | I booked my flight in March and the booking was confirmed soon after. I didn‚Äôt find out until a month prior that my booking changed and I wasn‚Äôt able to verify the change (thankfully the airport attendants were more than accommodating) but when I checked in on the return at first Air Canada didn‚Äôt even register that I had a connecting flight and then I almost had to pay for the same bag twice on my connecting flight (again the airport attendants saved me here as well) when I tried to talk to an agent i received only bots except once and even then they weren‚Äôt very helpful. This app has only lead to frustration and headaches for me. | Low cost flights and easy to use the app .I highly recommend using this app if you like to save money and find flights fast.üëçA | This app canceled my flight without my consent, with zero explanation. 

I then reached out to their support, switching from email to text per their demand. I gave them my confirmation number. My phone number. My email. My phone. 

Then they put me on a long hold, while asking ‚Äúare you still there‚Äù on a text chat. 

Then ‚Äúfor my security‚Äù they said they wouldn‚Äôt assist me without giving tons of additional personal info, after I already gave the above. This isn‚Äôt about security. It‚Äôs not for convenience. It‚Äôs a massive inconvenience to repeat all of this information repeatedly. 

It‚Äôs surveillance. It‚Äôs extortive. 

Spend your money elsewhere. 

All this could have easily been solved with one email- when they said they canceled my flight, via email, they could have simply stated why, in that email. 

They are choosing to provide poor service then being petty saying ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt help without tons of unnecessary information‚Äù which is not the truth. | Tried 2 months the app is not working at all. Search is not loading | Very poor service, they don‚Äôt have any customer service on call, chat only. Whoever chat agent they don‚Äôt know anything. They took my half day and problem still is there. | I was trying to book a flight to Orlando but the app crashes and it never loads anything. Uninstalling right away. | Great app but will refresh in the middle of checkout if u stay too long | Easy app to use | Excellent price and great service | They charges fees even with claimed free cancellation within 24 hour. Department of transportation rules and laws don't apply to them because they are a third party sales reps stations in Canada. Just book directly from the airline, they are bind by the law with no fees and full refund. The price is also the same. | We missed our flight due to typhoon flooding out of Manila. South Korea Airlines said there was a flight we could catch if Justfly switched our booking in order to make our connection. Justfly declined to help. My wife and I, with our 16 month old baby, we‚Äôre completely stranded. Again, Korean Air said Justfly could have saved the day but they didn‚Äôt. We will never book with them again. | Fast, trustworthy and very convenient service! | The title usually doesn‚Äôt go together high quality low price; however, with just fly that‚Äôs just what I got, a high quality low price airfare and hotel. | It was quick and simple to understand, thanks so much üëå | My ticket was really inexpensive and the booking was effortless with no problems. I‚Äôve used other cheap booking sites and have been disappointed. But I will be using justify again and again!!! Mahalo | Justfly.com has the best price on travel flights. App is user friendly. | Will never book s flight with them anymore. If you want to spend your time calling between justfly and the airline go ahead and book your ticket with them. They are the worst and wasted my time. | Excellent! | Great app in the past.  Stopped working last week after I installed the latest IOS update.  Doesn‚Äôt work in app or on website on my IPad.   Was it the software update and Justfly hasn‚Äôt caught up? Or something else‚Ä¶hmmm | do not trust this application | My favorite air tickets app ‚Ä¶ I have been using justify for past 15 years for me and my family.. love the service and price ..  best price | This was easy and saved money and time. üëç | The best price!!!! | Excellent service. Very easy to book. | Got me tickets on Hawaiian Airlines HNL-TYO in 10 days when HA website gave me errors in three browsers.  Seat selection fee is annoying, but a small amount. | Very reasonable airfares. 
Vinaka!! | Great flights prices. Could never go wrong. | One of the baddest app the system is error when I was booking flights supposed to be my actual date supposed to be on February 20 2023 somehow after I come from my booking surprise me when I see my flight on March 22, 2023 when I contacted the customer service I spent over 2 hours on hold on the phone and not getting the result fixed !!! Makes me ended up, contact my bank to dispute the money or they said, if you wanna make the correct change, you will to pay a lot of penalty fees, or you have to wait up 21 days which is not fair at all  ‚Ä¶.. | I can log into my account via a browser on line, but I cannot log in using the app? What‚Äôs that all about ? It just doesn‚Äôt work and I cannot reset a password either ? Please fix the app. | Thank you so much for cheap airfare, easy booking‚ù§Ô∏èü§ôüèº | I had the worst experience ever booking through this just fly.com. They changed one of my flights randomly and I can never get in touch with the customer care to inquire the reason. Now I'll have to lay over in one place for 14 hours (instead of 2.30 hrs as per my original booking). They are asking me to pay another $1900 to change it back to my original booking. It's a scam. Terrible. There should be a class action lawsuit if this happened to others. I'll never go though this one again nor I'll ever recommend this experience to anyone. | Not sure if this is a ‚Äúme‚Äù issue, but the app totally stopped giving me results of search. The page loads and loads for hours, no joke, hours. And nothing comes up. | Please update the app, it‚Äôs extremely glitchy and I can‚Äôt access any information I need. | Unusable‚Ä¶the app crashes on every login attempt | I booked with this company, I had insurance next thing I know I couldn‚Äôt fly the day I supposed to fly. I called then to do anything, cancel, change the fly they said no  this fly is take it or loose I was so mad, I called the insurance to try to get my money back nada ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ | I booked two different tickets for my family to come to my college graduation and instead they booked it vice versa. I went and checked numerous times what i typed from the history and I was right but for check in on the airline it was appearing vice versa. When I called them they told me they could not give me any money back and I had to rebook. My mom had to take a loan out for everybody to see my graduation and it messed up my grad gift. I have told literally everyone I know to delete this app and they have will never use again. | Never had any issues with the flights I‚Äôve booked through Justfly. It‚Äôs usually my go-to site. However, the app itself is pretty bad, quite glitchy and can‚Äôt do anything on it. I just end up going on the web page. App seems pretty pointless if it‚Äôs not working properly. | I loved this app , and I used it quite a few times and I found the best of the best deals , but unfortunately it‚Äôs not displaying the results for my flight searches , I hope that they can fix up this issue! | Im Back buying tickets to fly with you guys, BUT
I had problems in the past.
I hope don‚Äôt have problems again.. | This app deserves less than 1 star! I don‚Äôt usually give ratings for apps but had to leave a review after this. JUSTFLY is a SCAM. They take your money and cancel your flight. My wife and I went to the airport just for the airline to say that we were nowhere in their system even though we had an itinerary from JUSTFLY. We had to come out of our pockets $1000 just to get another ticket. Tried calling customer service but they do NOT answer the phone. This is ridiculous and these people should not be in business. | Great and easy process and got a great deal on my flight !!!!! | They will NOT issue refunds whatsoever if you cancel. I got the travel protection plan, however I got sick a few days prior to my flight and I‚Äôve been trying to get a refund from them since January 2022. No luck yet. | This app is no good at all, I booked an tickets from here is all way Delay and the customer service is very

There customer service is horrible and I was told that they cannot assist me in any way. Airline shared that they need us to purchase seating so that I can sit with my kids when I am purchasing all our flights together. When I bought flights online it states don‚Äôt worry your party will sit together the airline will assign your seating, which clearly is false information. DO Not BOOK or download this APp. They are a scam and do not do anything to help you. Also their cancellation policy is they will give you 5 dollars credit for your next flight. | I had a return trip from Shanghai to London and then to New York. Air China cancelled its flight, and I called Air China to put me on their flight next day. When I got to the Airport, I was told that my ticket was cancelled. What happened was that Kiwi cancelled my ticket with Air China without informing me. I had to purchase a new ticket myself. When I requested a refund from Kiwi, they stonewalled me, and I had to threaten to sue them before they agreed to issue me a refund, but the refund I finally got was only 20% of my new ticket. | My experience with Kiwi.com was disappointing and I feel it's important to share. I purchased four tickets for my family ‚Äì myself, my wife, our 4-year-old, and our 1-year-old. However, Kiwi.com only booked three tickets, insisting that my 1-year-old would be a lap child. I had paid for four tickets, so this was unacceptable. When I contacted their customer service, they claimed that infants can't have a separate seat and must be on a lap. However, this contradicts the fact that I had paid for a ticket for my infant. They then informed me that my infant should have a full-price ticket, equivalent to an adult ticket, which was $371. I pointed out that the airline's website stated that the price for an infant on a lap is $0. I requested a refund for the infant ticket if they couldn't provide a seat, but they refused. This experience felt like a scam and fraud. I've learned my lesson and will be more cautious in the future, opting to pay a little extra through official airline websites. | I really wanted to like Kiwi. I like the name and the ease of navigating the app. Thought it was a very smart process for saving money on a quick business trip. However, last year I booked three plane tickets worth over $450 and whilst it was in processing I realized I had to change the flight times due to a schedule change with one of the passengers. Unfortunately, when I went in to cancel it had just finished processing. 

Still figured it would be fine to cancel since it was less than an hour since booking and I was just going to change flight times on the Kiwi app and would've continued to use it for future trips. After all, I've had no issues with this using any other app or website ever. Instead, I was denied a refund and after contacting support they offered me $10 of app credits! For something I paid over $400 for.

Just use another platform or pay extra. I would've happily paid double anywhere else instead of being robbed  $400 + for no reason other than complete disregard for customer service and greedy policies. Lost a good customer and I'm one to recommend services/goods to other people. | It finds better deals than other apps by using travel hacks like exploring cheaper round trip tickets on a one-way itinerary, or getting off a multi-stop voyage at a connecting airport. I wish it could filter-out Boeing aircraft from the search results. Or at least show me the aircraft used for each trip like all the other apps do. | None of they say will happen after you read the little words so basically everything is a scam or a fraud in the ways of views, they always will say is not us is because the airline, so you basically are at they mercy. I bought a ticket for 400 dollars from Colombia to Chile, the expensiest I ever bought and also for change the fly was insane or asking the money back not even 24 hours after reservation was imposible, and they offer me 10‚Ç¨ back for cancel the fly !!! Can you imagine ?! The worst and for ask for more baggage 130‚Ç¨ but first they lie to you saying that is just 30‚Ç¨ but then you read the small letters and there you go, fraud again ! So cero recommend it ! | Cancelled a flight eligible with refund 500bucks gone. They said refund sent 10 dollars was returned for credit to use for my next flight. I contacted the airlines I booked through kiwi. They said they did not have anything under my name with the flights etc! They up stoked my money and gave me 10 dollars to use for my trip. I do not recommend them. Sure some folks got good experience with them but not me and I‚Äôm never getting my money back. Never using kiwi again. | My upcoming trip has flexible departure and return dates, but the app won‚Äôt show the pricing table and keeps defaulting to ‚Äúexact dates‚Äù in spite of consistently selecting ‚Äúdate range‚Äù. This makes the app useless in my opinion. | I realized I booked the wrong date for my flight so I attempted to get in contact for a refund, or change the flights around. I didn‚Äôt even get asked a question and they just sent me ‚Äúrefunded $10 credit to Kiwi.‚Äù This had not even been 24 hours since my booking. I called them and they said that since I was refunded $10 credit they couldn‚Äôt help me. I spent $322 and before a day had passed they would NOT refund my money. I called my bank, but because I used a debit card they can‚Äôt do anything. This is a scam! I am so disappointed. I tried to call again today and they disabled my booking number so I can‚Äôt even contact them. My last resort is to leave a bad review because you guys really took $322 from a student. They said they couldn‚Äôt refund me cause the airline had my money but my bank statement shows they haven‚Äôt even confirmed my money yet. 
It would be really appreciated if you would contact me and maybe give me something more than a measly $10 credit(that does NOT even COVER a luggage) absolutely pathetic and cheap.
And trust me I will be sharing my bad experience over tiktok. | The app is just links that take you back to google anyway. But I‚Äôm mostly mad because they cancelled my flight 3 hours before my flight was supposed to leave. I got my refund but it screwed me over. I definitely would not book last minute with them. | They did not help me and now I have an 8 hr layover and will miss an event. I called and was dismissed saying there was no option to help me. I won‚Äôt book with Kiwi again! Don‚Äôt book with them because a cheaper flight means they can change things on you with no help and no understanding or options. I‚Äôm very disappointed in their services. | I downloaded the app to check in, but after seeing this company wasn‚Äôt based in the US, I was hesitant to provide my passport number, which they said was needed to check in. So, I decided to check in with the airline. However, when I have tried to locate my confirmation number, I cannot find it anywhere in the emails they‚Äôve sent or in the app. This is understandably incredibly frustrating, as I either have to provide further personal details to a third party that are unnecessary or reach out to them to find a simple confirmation number. | Ten√≠a mis dudas pero quiero decir que cumpli√≥ con los compromisos y todo sali√≥ muy bien en un viaje de 3 escalas todo puntual, buenos precios ü´° | I have booked 2 flights on Kiwi I haven‚Äôt gone on either one just yet but if you are traveling aboard I suggest using this app to book low cost flights. The app is super easy to use. So far so good I will report back with an update on how the flight was. Stay tuned | They ask for your passport number for domestic flights. This is unnecessary. And it risks your sensitive info being hacked and available on the internet. | Me han facilitado todo el proceso de compra a diferencia de otras p√°ginas, adem√°s de eso los precios que dan en comparaci√≥n son la mejor opci√≥n es r√°pido y sencillo hacer todo en esta app me encanta y la recomiendo 100% | Compre un boleto hace un mes para mexico gaste como 287 dolares Pero lo cancel√© antes de 24 horas de haberlo comprado Llevo esperando mi reembolso Y resulta que solo me devolvieron 10 euros Mi dinero se lo quedaron ellos. 
No les recomiendo esta app ademas no puedes llamar a nadie solo puedes mandar mensajessüò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§ | Worst experience I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Worst customer service abilities. I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to speak to a manager. I asked repeatedly. No one was able to assist me. When I finally found a teller in the airport, they were like this is a continuous issue with kiwi, and they refused to book the correct flights. I will actually be telling every person I know to never ever ever book on this site again. you all made my trip so much more stressful and I almost missed my flight because of you always in ability to click a button while booking the flight for your customers. International Mexico travel requires you to note that you were a non-Mexican resident and pay the additional $41 tax fee but you all don‚Äôt wanna do that for whatever reason. terrible service. | Honestly, this is the most unethical scam, artist company I‚Äôve ever dealt with! If you have a problem, it will be nearly impossible for you to reach anyone to help resolve it. And when you do, they will screw you over and not help. I booked the flight and found out later that they changed my flight to a week earlier without telling me. When I finally after many attempts got in contact with someone, they pretty much admitted. The mistake was on their end, but said they couldn‚Äôt rebook me on another flight because that airline didn‚Äôt except check in luggage. So I went to the airline directly, and it was a lie, they do except check in luggage. So I bought directly with the airline. Then I tried to get a refund for my incorrect ticket, and they told me no and close the case. Do not book with Kiwi! | Thank you | Just downloaded the app and had a great experience and looking forward to using Keewee more in the future | Helps finding flights by dates and has all kind of filters to find your perfect trip. | I purchased my tickets through Kiwi, apparently it‚Äôs just cheaper to purchase airplane tickets directly through airlines hot charger $40 extra compared to airline website. Additionally they refused to provide refund within 24 hour period which is usually US law to my understanding. | Cost me so much money to rebook while at the airport they are using fraudulent credit cards to book with airlines then airline cancels their booking. Support team is terrible and do not care | My flight that I booked over kiwi was delayed which made me miss my connecting flight. When I contacted kiwi they told me that I had ample time to make my connecting flight which was a lie since  I basically rushed in order to make my connecting flight once I got off the plane. Costumer service was not helpful or even offered to help by booking a new flight. My itinerary stated that ‚Äúwe will jot leave you stranded‚Äù which they absolutely did. Worst third party service I have ever received. Please do not book anything with Kiwi. | Do not book with this agency they will book your tickets then tell you after words that they require more money  this company is a scam and when u need to speak to customer service they will give you a ring around | Incredibly misleading process. After booking the flight we received notification that our tickets were all purchased separately so we would need to leave the airport then check back in. With small children we decided this wouldn‚Äôt work. Upon examining our refund options we we were led to believe that we would get a credit to be used in the future on the site. THIS WAS WRONG‚Ä¶they refunded us $10 of the $1250 we paid. I‚Äôve done a ton of international and domestic travel and this is one of the worst experiences I‚Äôve had. Unethical. | Kiwi will literally steal your money and never (ever) refund it. They will change your messed up booking to another messed up booking then downgrade your ticket so you can‚Äôt ask them to fix their second mistake unless you pay even more money. Please don‚Äôt make the mistake me and my friend made. Kiwi stole over $1200 of our money, and didn‚Äôt start notifying us about issues with our booking until 120 days after booking. This meant we could not dispute the charge, get our refunds and move on. They know full well what they are doing and are not worth the stress. | Kiwi.com is a scam app! They will find every reason to not refund your $$$! Do not use them for anything! Save yourself the hassle and their bait and switch tactics! Horrible dishonest people! | Don‚Äôt waste your time to install this app, kiwi.com has highly misleading business practices. Coming from Google flight search, the price for a flight was USD 672 on kiwi.com. They offered a USD 48 discount on the app. But then the price in the app jumped to USD 719 while still USD on the web after refreshing - what a scam! I would rate this app zero stars, if I could. | The only reason I even put 1 star is that the review will not allow me to submit 0‚Ä¶ 

 Kiwi.com is a scam. All recent reviews suggest extremely problematic business practices. Their customer service support is intentionally dysfunctional to save them money and make changing your flight imposible. My friend and I bought tickets for a trip. They later changed our itinerary to leave and come back on completely different days from what we bought (and from each other). We both spent extra for ticket options where you are allowed to change your flights up to 48 hours before hand. We contacted them to change our flights entirely and they ended up putting me on hold and changing to my flight to something completely different from what I had asked. When I explained the correction they said we need to write to them with the details of the flight we want. We have done this at least 10 times back and forth. Each time they ‚Äúput in a request‚Äù which takes days to process and then they respond ‚Äúflight change not possible please enter new flight details‚Äù. This is despite us screenshoting the flight details directly from Kiwi.com‚Äôs site like they instructed us to do. I have asked for my case to be escalated to management a number of times which is also ignored. The fact of the matter is, we bought tickets with the option of flight change, however their customer support policies/ procedures make this (seemingly intentionally) imposible. I will be filing against the company to better the business bureau as well as bringing the case to small claims court. Big businesses like this should not be able to take advantage of people like this. My friend and I do not have a lot of money so spending money on a trip is already a stretch and now we have nothing to show for it. | stay far far away. i called the airline directly to workout some issues with my flights. they decided to fully refund me and help me re-book. no problem. EXCEPT they had to refund my original form of payment which apparently is Kiwi‚Äôs bank account. when i called kiwi to request a refund be made back to my card since my refund from the airline was in their bank account they told me because of the type of tickets i purchased i was only eligible for $10 in kiwi credit. really?? even though they had received my $500 refund from the airline, they were only offering me $10 in credits!? do yourself a favor and spend the extra $40 booking directly through an airline. | Absolutely horrific app, non existant customer service, and take days to confirm a booking. Then when you request a refund for the flight they failed to book, they only give it to you in ‚Äúkiwi credit‚Äù it can‚Äôt be legal for them to charge for a service they failed to provide. Give me my money back. Apple, look at the reviews and take this app down | This company is a SCAM NEVER BUY FROM THEM. I got my flights through Kiwi from Atlanta to phoenix. The morning I had my flight Kiwi emailed me saying that my flight was cancelled. The flight was not cancelled. I was able to get on my first flight but not the second causing me to be stranded across the country. I had to buy an additional $600 in flights through airline companies just to get to my destination and back home after the trip. 

The company will not answer your phone calls. They are a scam and will not help you. They put your name in with the airline companies but you most likely won‚Äôt be able to get onto your flight. You don‚Äôt get a confirmation number from the airline companies either.  

Luckily my credit card company was very helpful and kind and was able to get my a refund. But a $200 round trip flight ended up costing over $600 with lots of stress added. 

They are a scam of a company. It‚Äôs ridiculous that anyone would be so rude to scam people and strand people in unknown places for their own benefit. Don‚Äôt book with them. | I bought 2 tickets to Chicago
The company on the last day sent that registration at the airport is required, at the airport an employee said that the company works semi-legally and they can not register, only sell new tickets .... lost $ 300 that was not returned | Stole my money. Use a more reputable company. They told me my flight was not available and tried to charge me more money. I tried to get a refund. They cancelled my flight and then wouldn‚Äôt give me the refund. $3,354!!! They tried to give me a credit for another purchase for $10! Not okay. They should be shut down | Avoid use this App at all cost, it‚Äôs a scam. the prices are not cheap. The service is horrible, I can‚Äôt get my money back even after my flight got cancelled because I didn‚Äôt pay extra for the premium service. And it takes months to get credit back to use for my next flight. Buying a ticket in this app means you can‚Äôt return or exchange at all. Or you pay a lot more to do so. The app also trick you to pay more for luggage that‚Äôs already included with the ticket. I still have credit here that‚Äôs not used but I would rather leave my credit than using them again. This company should go bankrupt, they don‚Äôt deserve to have customers. | I cannot board a flight due to a very valid unforeseen circumstance. They won‚Äôt issue me a refund, throwing the terms and conditions at me even though the airline is willing to issue a refund. | How can I upgrade from a saver ticket to a standard or flexi ticket?  It seems ridiculous to me that you can‚Äôt do this. | I don‚Äôt like how they force you to download the app just to get your boarding pass‚Ä¶please email it to us | fake application be careful they stole my money | They have the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever received in my life. I booked a ticket through them with bags included, and when it came time to check in the airline told me that I owed the balance for the bag, when I contacted Kiwi to try to get help with that they kept on telling me that everything looked good on their end. The airline would not let me check in until I pay the balance so I had to pay it because I needed to get on my flight. I emailed and called kiwi to try to get a refund and they will not give it to me. Do not book your flight or travel through this app. | This is by far the worst booking app I have used ever. First, it took them a entire day to book the flight after I made the payment. Second, they screwed up my baggage credit so that I have to buy the check in baggage credit at the airport. Then my flight got canceled and Kiwi did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!! It didn‚Äôt inform me the cancellation; refuse to refund; and offers ridiculous price for reschedule new flight, the new one way flight is the same as my original round-way flight. I have never seen such disguising practice in any business for a long time. AVOID IT LIKE A PLAUGE!!! | I missed my connecting flight with Volaris due to a flight delay with Viva Aurobus and they won‚Äôt assist me with my connecting flight or any reimbursement! They told me Kiwi is responsible | I read all the recent reviews, DEFINITELY NOT BOOKING WITH THEM deleted app! | DO NOT BOOK WITH KIW! | This company is terrible. It‚Äôs really bad. 

You probably won‚Äôt loose money like me. They make me feel like a joke. 

First of all They canceled my baggage service. After that as a human I had to cancel the whole flight. They NEVER refunded my flight and now I‚Äôm $500 damaged.

After talking to the support claiming my money back the informationthat I had was (Sorry. You cancel the trip in a non-refundable ticket)

Well, I just cancel the flight because they cancel my baggage service. And looks like I‚Äôll never see that 500$ again. | Absolute scam canceled my flight (that was booked well in advance) at 4 am week of the flight. Left me no choice but to overpay for a last second flight. I can‚Äôt even get a refund for this until 3 months time I can ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù get reimbursed?! Absurd way to scam an active duty service member during the holidays. Everyone involved with this are fraudulent. If you‚Äôre seeing this spend more money for a better flight through a different vendor, through a different app because it actually save you more money by not getting scammed! | Works worse and worse with time. Out of 3 last flights once they booked a wrong flight telling in the app it‚Äôs correct and twice they screwed up hours (one causing me to loose a flight). Their service used to be good, now it spreads misinformation | This app was nice to find a cheap flight (as long as you don‚Äôt mind spending the night in an airport). However, one thing that was super inconvenient is that the boarding passes in the app do not update that gate number, leaving a permanent ‚ÄúTBD‚Äù status.

The route it chose for me to a particular destination was nearly 11 hours vs the 7 hours Sygic and Google routed. You do get transferred to the actual Sygic navigation app for GPS navigation but again that is inconvenient. 2) Even if it was just a summary I‚Äôd like to see my whole trips itinerary instead of just being able to see a single day. 3) I was going to send this note as feedback to them but their feedback email doesn‚Äôt allow you to actually SEND the email. 4) Finally, there have been no updates for over a year, which implies they don‚Äôt really care too much about it.  Maybe I don‚Äôt understand the app well enough but it‚Äôs looking like it was a waste of money. | This app is wonderful. One question. I know Sygic gps navigation does not require Wi-Fi of cellular. Could that be incorporated into Sygic Travel? | In 2016 we were traveling through California‚Äôs vast Anza Borrego dessert and lost cell signals. Scary! We found our way out and I looked for an app that would serve as an offline GPS, rather than adding a cumbersome Garmin device. After installing Sygic I literally could navigate anywhere without the need for a cell signal (other than initially downloading maps). 
     That was the start of my appreciation of the extraordinary value and features of Sygic! It continues to get better with more features  since 2016. We travel about half the year throughout the country in our Class B RV (Ford Transit camper van). Apple Car Play supports both Apple and Google maps, but Sygic through Car Play is our go-to navigation.  We depend on it and the features other navigation does not offer that are too extensive to list here. | Great app. Wonderful for creating day-by-day sightseeing itineraries, which is exactly what I was looking for. But 1 star deduction because it claims to support Family Sharing and yet doesn‚Äôt even show up I‚Äôm my subscriptions list, which makes it impossible to share. | When one doesn‚Äôt understand what it takes to develop an app, you get reviews like the ones who complain about its costs and features for premium version. I did not hesitate one second getting the premium version of this app, it has all-in-one what other apps offer separately or lack functionality. You get trip planning suggestions, tour suggestions and their cost, navigation help and instructions, all the information you need to plan your trip and a lot more! Honestly, this app is a gem and the developers really outdid the features and actually carefully selected what one user NEEDS and can get lots of advantage for. I cannot stress enough how awesome of an app this is. I just downloaded and needed to share my thoughts because I barely buy apps and let alone leave reviews but this one deserves every good review it gets. I applaud for the effort and thoughtfulness of making this app the most convenient one for trip planning I have seen in the app store. Thank you and I really hope you continue making it as awesome as it is and seamless to navigate. Two suggestions as an iPad user would be a calendar view to visualize trips in a calendar format (or calendar integration, which I am still exploring in the app) and an apple pencil/ draw format for note taking as it is easier for me to use but those two suggestions are just that, the app is awesome as is and has a lot of room for growth. | If you are not a premium user you are done this app will not provide any information for free. | I just downloaded the app and planned for my trips, the app is amazing (free version) however, for me as a traveller, I would like to know the admissions/fee of the attractions. Along with budgeted amount.

I would recommend to add this feature (even if for paid version) and it will be great app ever. | This had a few tourist sites listed.  Other than that, I find Gaia more useful:  Lots of map choices.  Tracks my location.  Routes easy to set up | I travel alot and this app paired with the sygic world maps premium package are great. Even if you have zero internet connection you have offline access. I used in at the Grand Canyon on a motorcycle ride and came in handy was not able to get my maps to work on google and sygic came thru gave me gas stations on the route etc and made it back in total darkness without any interruptions üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª | Wasted half a day fighting with this app trying to input a specific scenic day trip route.  Good for point a to point b routing but nothing more.  Waste of time and money imho. | I just paid for premium and it‚Äôs still trying to up-sell me.
No user info in login.
Definitely not intuitive!
Not having a good time! | This was so smart and easy and worked all through our trip - kept everything in order and got us everywhere in London & Paris! | We‚Äôve been using Sygic travel app for a few years.  We are the do-it-all-by-ourselves crazy type who always try to squeeze as much as we can in the short time we managed to take off.  This app makes planning an itin so much easier.  We usually start off with reading various attractions both in app and online.  After we identify where we want to go, select what we want to do in each day and the app map out a logical route and give us an estimate of how long the itin will take.  Planning to go to the 50th country next. | I downloaded this and tried to set up a trip. I failed completely. Not intuitive at all. | I‚Äôve tried a few and this one is by far the best. I love how it lets me schedule my day with walking distance (or car/train etc) being able to estimate my entire day. It also gives me the map on how to get there etc. I‚Äôve used it in Italy, Greece, Turkey and now I just got done planning my France trip. I love it! | Keeps crashing, too few sort filters, way to slow, needs a complete overhaul ! | Been a premium user since 2016.  Been happy on most part.  Would like integration with CityMapper for public transportation routing so that I don‚Äôt need to exit this app and then to type in location in CityMapper.  The Visitacity free map already can do that. | I have been enjoying this App since the year 2015 or before.  I use it on my international trips, has never let me down. Thank you for this great app. | If you buy this you will only get support if you have the original receipt. Save that receipt, or don‚Äôt expect to ever have an issue. | I attempted to make a route using my iPhone, which was difficult. After reviewing, I see that you develop a route online, then save it (favorite) and it‚Äôs supposed to show in your App.   I do see the route on my iPad, but not my iPhone.  And, when I try to ‚Äòshare‚Äô from my iPad, it shuts down/closes the App.   What gives????? | After the last update the app is not working I have perches some of options but it‚Äôs look like I‚Äôm losing money with your app after the update | It is a good basic app but to make it perfect developers need to:
- add lots of missed attractions.
- make country Templates ‚ÄúRoad Trip‚Äù.
- make a list of top attractions as you zoom out. | ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÅÿ∂ŸÑ ÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸÖÿ¨ ÿ™ŸÑÿ™ŸÜŸÇŸÑ | Please Add Persian Support Language Like Official Sygic | Hi I am trying to make an app with the same concept but I‚Äôm going to focus on a small island only. How hard was it choosing between developers and may I ask how much it costed?
Thanks | This app is absolutely worthless!  To build an itinerary is painful. You first need to build it on a piece of paper because there is no editing. Even if you input the time for each site the app will not move the items in the correct order. You can not choose the mode of transportation between places. The app picks one for you. Basically zero flexibility with this thing. Very disappointed, now I‚Äôm sure it will be a pain to cancel the monthly subscription. | Everything has been working just fine and unjust wish there was a way of ticking or clicking done on the things I‚Äôve already fulfilled on my list. | A waste of time, it's free to download and nothing else, I can't even try it because I have to pay. Deleted. | Trips from my group will not appear in my app. Only on the computer version which defeats the purpose. | Doesn‚Äôt allow you to create your own itineraries. | Great app especially putting a trip together on a computer but a total disappointment when coming to the app on an iPhone XS Max. Even when I‚Äôm in hotspots takes forever to go from one screen to the other and majority of the time it kicks me straight out. Doing a lot of travel to Europe the first couple times I used this app was slow but ok but my last trip to Cologne it was non functional period. | Nothing on this app works. I paid 4.99 for everything and I can‚Äôt even make an account. Can‚Äôt save anything. Everything I click just pops up with an error code. Terrible app I‚Äôd like a refund. | The search is terrible and you can‚Äôt find anything. When you try to search by street names it re directs you to a entirely different search. | It‚Äôs good improvement. 
thanks | Who is giving this thing good reviews??? It just freezes up. Totally unusable. But they got their $4 out of me and thats all that matters. | You have to pay to see anything | I was hoping it will work but it is complex and not worth the money.  I consider myself a tech savvy but got lost in the complexity.  Wish I could get the money back. | What good are the offline maps if the software is going to insist on attempting to provide a preview of the route using online data when sufficient data connection is not available. | This makes it so easy to find places to see, it lets you pick bubbles on the map and dig into reviews and other valuable information right there. Then adding an item to your itinerary is simple and you can start managing the days on the trip so you aren't doing too much or too little. | I used to plan to my trips using trip advisor, however they took away the ability to schedule items within each day of the trip. I tried using Google Trips, Tripline, and any other app that was recommended for trip planning. Sygic is the only one I have tried which had all the options I needed. Some of the features I appreciate include: being able to select multiple types of transportation for each day. If I am trying to plan a route on google maps for a day it won‚Äôt let me switch between using a car and using public transportation. Sygic let‚Äôs me decide for each destination whether I want to drive, take public, transportation, etc. The app also estimates based on the activities and routes how long of a day it will be. I used to manually estimate how long I would spend at each place I wanted to visit based on googles average for how long people spend there. Sygic automatically has an estimate for each travel site already. Also those times can be adjusted if needed. 
The premium feature of printing trips to PDF is also great. The PDF looks great and includes the travel guides for the cities you are visiting. 
Overall the app has everything I want from a trip planning app and I looking forward to continuing to use it for many more trips to come! | Wow off to Japan, and Asia. Out of all the app‚Äôs this one is way better the all others and I purchased five looking for something like this one. Thank you | Just started using this app and I like how easy it is to plan your itinerary out. Even share it. The biggest problem I have is being able to use my choice of navigation. I‚Äôd like to be able to use Google Maps or Apple maps for directions but it forces you to use their GPS solution, which then requires an additional purchase to get turn by turn directions!

Update: User error. Sygic actually uses Apple‚Äôs way of doing their settings so it wasn‚Äôt apparent to the user. Support is correct and you can change the default navigation app. Home Screen/Springboard > Settings > Sygic Travel. Amazing. The only issue I have is the app should walk you through an initial setup to get these things sorted out. With this fixed definitely an app I could recommend to others. Transferring my itinerary back to this now. Thank you! | Move an item from one day to the next, deletes any notes you had on that item. Pretty frustrating, for what would appear to be a rather simple programming task. | ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜ ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÉŸàŸäÿ™ ŸÖŸÜ ÿπÿ¥ÿßŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÅÿ±
ÿ¥ŸÉÿ≥ÿ®Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÉŸàŸäÿ™ | I have been using this product in the last couple of weeks it has great features that you don't see them in other GPS applications. | ŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ≤ ÿ≥ÿπÿØŸàŸÜ ŸÑÿµŸäÿßŸÜŸá ÿßŸÑÿßŸäŸÅŸàŸÜ | Loved Sygic for planning trips. Newest version lost all the tools and views I relied upon to plan my trips. How can I get the old version if the app back? Find the new version impossible to plan, arrange and time my day. | Be VERY careful. If you install you will be charged $25 to your Apple account without your approval.  Apple should take this down!

Apple directs me to YOU!  Fix it.  To all others, when you download it will default to a $25 premium per year subscription. If you press any key you will be subscribed and your money gone.  Its a crappy app as well. | At November we traveled in Turkey, and we have some problem with navigation, we can‚Äôt choose road, I am writing about that to support and after two month all problem fixed.

This update lays the rails for essential fixes and improvements.

You might not notice any visual changes, but we‚Äôve done some work in the back-end to improve our app‚Äôs performance.","316",0,"USD",true,334235184,"thetrainline","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/thetrainline/id334235184?uo=4","https://www.thetrainline.com",4.90841,"We are at the train station and need help, the station says that since I purchased from this company I must call this company.

This company has no phone number to call for help. They have an email, but for immediate needs, email is them akin to snail mail, not possible.  

My advice is to just purchase your ticket through the national rail system for the country you are traveling through. This way, if / when issues arise, you can get immediate help at the station. | First of all, the best value it provides is the convenience to buy tickets in the palm and seamless integration of payment with Apple Pay, and maybe discount tickets sometimes.

But, it has a few serious UX issues need to be addressed. 
1) unable to save companion passengers info. It becomes annoying that every search you have to reenter them.
2) it somehow saves the dates and stations of the last search, and if you are not being careful, you can end up buying the wrong tickets. It happened to us that we end up buying tickets at the spot in the train station, but the tickets are for two days later. Luckily the ticket inspector on the train gave us a break, and we just let the wrong tickets expire.
3) on the return trip, it tries to charge about 9 euros booking fee, so we went to the ticket office, and was able to save 30 euros. The train is about to start in 20 minutes, so ticket agent may be offering a discount, but this is not reflected on Trainline app.
Anyways, I will not use this app anymore for spontaneous tickets. But it could be useful for planned travel when not in a hurry. | Do not use it, the tickets I bought were invalid. And they do not provide refund. | If you the app be careful. I bought my train tickets and in the worse moment in the middle of the trip block my user name. The result: lost of my tickets. Try to get in contact and no answer. So again be careful. | I use OrarioTreni to check and control the time and status of trains in Italy. It has been bought by train line yet TRAINLINE doesn‚Äôt give me the features of OrarioTreni. And on iPhone 15, for some reason I am unable to close the prompt to transfer to TRAINLINE. I‚Äôm so annoyed that the one app I used daily (ORARIOTRENI) is no unavailable to me. 

And train line is not a substitute for me. I‚Äôm sitting on a train now, wanting the live status of my train. It doesn‚Äôt help me‚Ä¶.. | Unlike national rail apps, Trainline prefers to suggest intercity routes rather than big brands like TGV or EuroStar, which makes it exceptionally easy to bypass problems on the track. It‚Äôs helped me many times to bypass cancellations or construction by approaching the city from a different direction. The best part: the route is provided already, and all the tickets can be bought in just one click.

The downside is that this preference for intercity trains with lots of transfers isn‚Äôt ideal if you‚Äôre trying to save time, if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with navigating train stations, or if your train is delayed. If you need direct routes, they can be found on Trainline, but you have to search carefully. | This app is very easy and intuitive‚Ä¶ until you actually have to use it. Do not use this app‚Äî especially if you are traveling in a foreign country!!! It will screw you sideways and make you think it‚Äôs your fault, or that you are crazy. I absolutely never write reviews for anything, but I want to save someone else the trouble. DO NOT USE TRAINLINE TO TRAVEL!!!! | They will not refund money when their app and systems fail. Emails go to spam, app doesn‚Äôt load ticket. It‚Äôs all on the customer. Shame on this company | I downloaded this app and tried to buy a ticket but once I had entered my credit card information I was oddly invited to join a movie service. This I declined, but then was contacted by my credit card company about a fraudulent transaction. I had just been charged 5 pounds by the movie service!!! I was unable to buy the train ticket. This is a shocking experience that they need to fix asap! | Trainline does an exceptionally poor job communicating that when taking trains from EU to UK you need to arrive early and go straight to customs. Because of this I missed my train, along with 20 other people. The station had many attendants ready to handle this, because 20 people miss every train because of this poor messaging. I thus missed my connecting train in London and had to buy a new ticket at 600% the price. Trainline customer support was no help. In fact their phone number just went straight to voice mail regardless of how many times I called, forcing me to use their text chat. | This app worked the first time used it but now I cannot log in or change my password. All that appears is a blank screen after brief flicker. If I try to create a new account, it says that my email already exists. Online chat was of no help. | The app threw in random other stops into my search results so I accidentally booked the  wrong destination station. Could not exchange my or ticket or change it even though I called within minutes of booking it. Ended up wasting 40 euros for a bad and confusing interface and a company that won‚Äôt honor its own exchange  policy. Absolutely terrible and unacceptable. | This made getting around the UK really Easy! | App won‚Äôt let me type in my destination, so I can‚Äôt buy a ticket. Also, no English options, which isn‚Äôt great. | When rescheduling a train trip that only costs $2 more than the original ticket they charge a fee that‚Äôs 60% of the cost of the previous ticket. Price gouging at a level I only see with Ticketmaster. Very predatory business practice. | App functionality is good.  The app does not always assign a seat and that causes near disruption to travel.  No seat is no seat.  Either stand or take another train. | Seriously if there was a points scheme for this app I would be platinum elite. I use this app so much and it‚Äôs so easy to use!!! Also, if you need to change, or refund, it‚Äôs EAAAASY. it‚Äôs my go to train app and it never fails. | I used this company to purchase tickets from Italy to go to Germany and to return. the Italian train was canceled and this company said you can‚Äôt get a refund from us because the trains you had to reschedule in Germany had nothing to do with the trains that I purchased in Italy.
so if you have to reschedule tickets because of one company but they‚Äôre booking everything separately for you, you will be screwed. 
and then they refuse to even give you a refund for their service fees, it‚Äôs ridiculous.

 It says you can easily reschedule and Manage the tickets to their app but you cannot. when you go to click on manage or reschedule it says that you have to call their customer service, the number doesn‚Äôt work, or you have to email them. by that point your travel plans have already been disrupted you will be forced to purchase additional tickets and you won‚Äôt be able to wait for their customer service team to respond to reschedule your tickets.

 This is just ridiculous. Do not ever use this app and I will never be using this app again I‚Äôm gonna use it to find out where the tickets and the trains are but I will never purchase through them again. | Do not download another train app. This app covers Europe with a user interface that is about as good as Uber. | Bestü´°üíö | I used this for multiple tickets in Italy. It was supposed to be 80% refundable but when I tried to change tickets, it said I would receive $0. Do not use it. | If you have any issues with delays or cancellations - good luck. Customer support is useless and they will simply say they are a third party provider and can‚Äôt help you. | Do not trust the bookings. And then no customer service. Lack of ability to make changes even after train delays. Does not link to real train times. This is not good and I do NOT recommend this app to anyone. They are crooks. Book your tickets directly. | We purchased multiple tickets through their system. Some tickets came through email as an attachment for iwallet which worked GREAT. Other tickets came through as a link to the app. These (1) had different train times in the header than for the body of the ticket and (2) didn't always show up on the app but as a download to print or just not at all. 

There seems to be no rhyme or reason to this system. It‚Äôs confusing, inaccurate, and just an all-around frustration for my wife and I.  Zero stars. | Used on a trip thru Europe. Useful for searching the train schedules. Buying tickets thru them is a bad idea. App sometimes changes the stations you are searching (for no apparent reason). Once you purchase, you are out of luck- nice gentlemen at customer service empathized with me because ‚Äòno one likes to lose their money‚Äô but the ticket policies are up to the train and Trainline can do nothing even if the tickets were purchased a few seconds ago.  At least the app could prompt ‚Äòyou are buying tickets to leave in one hour from a station 1000 km from your current location. Are you sure?‚Äô
Wrote off those tickets and bought at the station- cheaper base fare, no ‚Äòservice‚Äô fee, and the machine defaulted to start the trip at the station where I was. Don‚Äôt see any reason to pay extra to buy via the app | Have fun booking a ticket when the price increase out from under you several times in a row. The app doesn't hold the fare during checkout. | Bought a OUIGO train ticket from Paris to Marseille. We arrived on time and expected to have a seat. We went looking for our seat and there‚Äôs no Carriage 18 on this train. It looks like we got the correct train to Marseille which left the station at the exact time we were supposed to be leaving. The train only has 10 carriages and yet our ticket says Carriage 18. There‚Äôs a carriage 8 with our seat number but he showed us a ticket for theirs. So we are now stuck here on this train to Marseille for 3+ hours without a seat at this super hot carriage. Never again!! | Train ticket I got has no seat number, no carriage number, no class of service, etc. All of that info needs to be clearly on the ticket and it‚Äôs not. I had to dig through my e-mail to find that info. | Trainline is not affiliated with any UK rail organisation, and as such, can charge whatever they like with ridiculous terms & conditions. Booking with Trainline means you can pay 2x normal rate, can‚Äôt change your booking and might not have the most up to date schedule. STAY AWAY | Have not used this terrible app since before 2020 and all credit cards have now expired.  Seeking to reserve  train tickets now but never purchased any.  Then magically nonrefundable tickets with incorrect date appear as purchases; no idea why.
Most outrageous flaw is that Apple Pay now appears as valid form of payment though I never added it and obviously it did not exist when i last used this app.
I strongly advise against launching this app until developer corrects these serious bugs.
IMO Trainline is dishonest and unethical. | The app works very well for booking train travel, but I attempted to cancel to pre-booked train tickets that were ‚Äúrefundable‚Äù,  the app malfunctioned in both cases and would not allow me to cancel travel. It referred me to a bad number for customer service, leaving me only email. Since email is only checked every 24 hours, they didn‚Äôt honor the requested cancellation. 

The Trainline contact information does not appear on the website, and the referral number provided by the app was incorrect. As a result, I did not get my refund. when I eventually reached the call center after endless emails, they were of absolutely no help.

If I could give zero stars, I would. | I can use the sign on with Apple just fine on the website but it won‚Äôt log on in the app‚Ä¶. | Tried to book tickets for Europe trip. Unfortunately, an immature app, poor infrastructure, and horrendous customer service resulted in a substantial waste of time and money. ‚ÄúWe are just the reseller‚Äù is what they say to deflect responsibility; actually their business is just reselling, so they should try to do it well. Not the case. | Used this app for my trip to Austria. 
1. It doesn‚Äôt give you all the possible routes. I found faster and better routes by manually playing with the different stations. 
2. When looking to by a ticket routes kept disappearing 
3. When trying to buy a ticket for my son I kept getting a generic error and was about to be late for the train. 
4. Booked a ride which turned out to switch to a bus and that had no indication in the app. 

Would recommend using the trains app which is much better. | I actually forgot my wallet at home in the US and all I had with me for a 6N trip thru London and the UK was my Applewallet. Being able to download the app and buy train tickets right on my phone totally saved me! App was easy to use, schedules were clear‚Äîeven for a visitor! | I have used trainline to make plans for my upcoming trip and it has been a real tragedy 

To start with, The Trainline App runs fast and stable on iPhone BUT they‚Äôd search results shows different price every 10 minutes. It creates an sense of urgency and push you to book .

Second, their prices are 30-100% higher than what I found on the train company website , it is unbelievable how much markup they add. 

Finally, their refund policy is MISLEADING and even deceiving and I have big regrets to put my faith in it. No matter what you choose , economy , premium , smart plus , you name it, they WON‚ÄôT let you claim a refund . It is always ‚Äú non-refundable ‚Äú ,  what I saw at the booking page is refundable , yet at the end , they won‚Äôt give a penny back . I read the policy back and forth with attention, spending my time to choose the best option , yet , I don‚Äôt have the option to change or refund when my travel plan updates , they either show you options of a double price ticket or non refundable.

I sincerely regret it and would warn anyone who wants to use trainline app: it is a rip-off | I‚Äôve used a few websites and booked trains all over Europe. This app is utterly useless to me. It literally does nothing other than give an error message with no further direction or help. Wasted my time. | I don‚Äôt travel that often by train, but when I do I use this app to get tickets. Easy to use timetable to see options, I use Apple Pay and digital tickets, no problems. | Will not process my Amex !!..tried 2 different cards and wouldn‚Äôt take them!!!said could verify information supplied‚Ä¶triple checked correct and still wouldn‚Äôt take it!!! | This app is great, especially if you‚Äôre traveling in UK! | Full stop. | I get an error every time I try to checkout. So annoying, I picked out my train and entered all of my info. I wish it told me at the getting that it wasn‚Äôt going to work | Very easy to navigate and plan.  Actually getting payment to work is impossible.  Tried 4 different ways.  Gave up.  Take care of your customers or someone else will.  ‚úåÔ∏è | I‚Äôve travelled within countries as well as cross-border between Germany, Belgium, UK, and Austria and this worked beautifully everywhere. I love that I can use ApplePay within the app to buy e-tickets including Eurostar and they worked in all the countries where etickets are accepted (UK often requires paper) but between countries as well as within each country without having to look for a ticket kiosk. I only wish it showed which platform the train was departing from but still a must-have app. | A recent trip to Spain gave us the opportunity to use this App. It is an excellent App. Simple, easy to use. 100% reliable. Much‚Ä¶MUCH better than the Amtrak App in the US. | Excellent app for taking trains in Europe. Some features could be a bit more refined, like consistently including carriage and seat numbers on train tickets (for DB trains they are in the confirmation email only) it live platform updates, but all around a must for train travel in Europe (EU + UK) | When I purchased a train ticket, the number on the ticket provide by the app did not match the actual train number that I was to take. Therefore I missed the train. Because it was the last train of the night I had to stay overnight in a hotel. The cost of a taxi to/from the station, hotel and new ticket was significant. 

I emailed the company yet never received a response. 

In conclusion, this app is not accurate. It‚Äôs not reliable. It‚Äôs not responsive and could end up costing you a lot of money. | Wonderful experience | Tried to book tickets but got message

10:14
Well, this is awkward
Sorry! There was a problem at our end of the line. Please try again.
OK

Rebooted several times, reinstalled app both to no avail. Thank goodness for old fashioned telephone call. Presumably works ok on laptop, but that‚Äôs not what I want, nor what worked perfectly well previously. Did inform Trainline so probably will be rectified soon. | The promise made in the app is that you have several hours to cancel for a refund after booking. However, cancellation is technically impossible while the ticket is in a status of ‚Äòcreating‚Äô, which mine was for several hours after my purchase. I needed to cancel and I was unable to do so before the cancellation window expired.

There have been so many terrific options that I'm having trouble narrowing it down! | Informative and love the deals | Very convenient and easy navigation throughout the app. Highly suggest it for planning out a vacation. | These deals are absolutely unbeatable.

Love the layout and love to see entire cost all together most apps don't show that. | liked it | Easy smooth app that is easy to navigate and also has great deals packages | Good app I would recommend it | I downloaded this app about a week ago when my mom, aunt & I started talking about a girls trip. So far I have only used it to search for potential trips and have not actually booked anything. The only improvement I would make is the ability to narrow your search down a little more.

Yes power-ups are cheaper, but the game is a lousy knock off of Royal Match. It is boring with out all the extra fun side games/challenges going on. 

I bought the ‚Äúpasses‚Äù the last 2 months and never got ANY of my winnings. I have contacted their customer support multiple times and I DON‚ÄôT GET ANY RESPONSE!

I get mistakes and glitches. But these guys don‚Äôt respond. Royal Match does. Quality and more fun with Royal Match. | I‚Äôve played lots of games over the years and this is the only game that freezes | Would love to give this game 5 stars.. it‚Äôs a great game BUT‚Ä¶ there is absolutely NO customer support. ZIP! None! I have contacted every way I can and have had no help. The chat leaves a LOT to be desired- is randomly shuffled and only able to write about 2 lines. NO EMOJIS allowed! (Weird) Out team has had multiple weeks when we‚Äôve all played hard and not a single win registers At tournaments so most give up and chalk it up to another glitchy week:( I‚Äôve been at top level and haven‚Äôt seen an update in weeks only to see other teams 200 ahead. I‚Äôm at 3,001 others at 3,201 but no update anywhere‚Ä¶ again, WEIRD! And of course not a single way to contact support. This COULD be a great game-almost exact replica of Royal Match, which is actually FANTASTIC and does have a support u can reach out to with any problems. Unfortunately, this game has SOOOO many glitches it gets very infuriating! Not ready to give up but just putting the warning out there to others‚Ä¶ expect NO customer support and a VERY glitchy game. | If royal match can achieve no ads then so can this it‚Äôs super annoying | Being forced to either pay or watch an ad every two levels is bad enough, but the ads then freeze my tablet and I lose progress. This one is going to get deleted. Shame because the levels are pretty good. | I play this game on my 10 minute break at work but can‚Äôt play as many times due to all the advertising PLEASE STOP | Really, travel batch is a really great game. It‚Äôs really fun. You can solve fun but challenging puzzles, decorate areas, and play fun events. The problem is the ads. About level 20 you will start to see ads pop up once you beat a level. This game would be a five star but because of all the ads I put it at four stars. But if the ads were removed or optional like to get a life then I would give it five stars. Though, Travel Match slightly a copy game. It is very similar to royal match. Both games, decorate areas, both games, have similar events, and both games share the same style. But I don‚Äôt really care if it‚Äôs a cop game I still enjoy it.
If the ads were removed or optional, then I would give this game a five star, and it would be the best match three game. So please remove the ads and I will give this game a five star. | If I mute the sounds for the game the ads should mute too. I TURN THE SOUND OFF FOR A REASON. | Game freezes as soon as you get power ups. I love playing and will continue if they fix the issue | This game was fun until we got to level 23 and then it‚Äôs full on ads after each level. It‚Äôs annoying and frustrating. App deleted! | Some times you get sick of Match games but this one is fun to play, I‚Äôm on level 28 and only seen 1 ad! I hope that doesn‚Äôt change! | too too too many ads- after every turn whether you pass or not . There is a pay option to stop ads , but I think I‚Äôll just delete and go to ad free game. | Travel Match used to be one of my favorite match games because it was fun, addictive and had no ads.  I recently logged in to play and was disappointed at the number of ads.  There are ads after every screen. I guess that I will have to find another game because I am not going to pay for ‚ÄúAd Free.‚Äù | Very entertaining. | I absolutely loved this game, great graphics, no ads, played it everyday. Then you added the feature to watch ads for more moves which was amazing. Now you force us to watch ads after each level? They glitch the game and freeze after the ads too! No thanks. Royal match doesn‚Äôt force us, neither does dream island. I played this all the time and now greedy developers stay greedy. How typical. Plenty other match 3‚Äôs out there. Time to play one of those. ‚úåüèª. | Love this game as a replacement to Royal Match, which I‚Äôm boycotting because they raised prices. This is an exact duplicate but better. Love this game. But don‚Äôt raise your prices. | I was play along fine and then üí• advertising after each round.   It usually takes me 30 seconds to play.  2 annoying ads every single minute.   A bit much, wouldn‚Äôt you say? | It was fine after I played for awhile, until I only got one move when i was supposed to get 5. | I LOVED this game - then someone decided to add advertisements after each level win. So I quit, but yesterday I decided to load the game again and much to my pleasure the ads are gone. Once again I am in love with Travel Match. | This app is just like a lot of apps out there.  You get hooked up to a point when suddenly you realize you‚Äôve used all your free stuff then here come the 10-45 second ads with startling sound and all your tools from now on have to be purchased.  Don‚Äôt waste your time. | Great game until the ads came. Games like Royal Match do not have any ads. Every time you fail or pass a level‚Ä¶..you get an ad. It‚Äôs a shame because I enjoyed the game up to that point | Love this game but way too many ads and most of them are 30 seconds or more. After every game win or lose. Very frustrating to have to wait all the time. | I was genuinely enjoying this game, that is, until the ads started popping up after every single match!! Super annoying and definitely do not play as much as before. On the look out for other match 3 games without all the annoying ads! | Asked for help moving game to new phone from tech support and never got it. Started over and now there are ads after every level. Did not receive coins after beating a challenge, sent in to tech support and no answer either. Can‚Äôt figure out how to eliminate the ads in new game | To many ads and the game it self is really slow. | Don‚Äôt like the breaks after if level..the other apps that come on‚Ä¶waiting my time‚Ä¶ | Ridiculous amount of Ads now. Used to be Ad free but now there is advertising after every level | This game used to be fun. No ads ever. Now all of a sudden there is an ad after every attempt to play the game! Delete this app if you have it!!!  Nice job developers! You have runes a great game! | Where are commercials that when you hit the X mark to get back to the game it does nothing you have to shutdown the game and restart the iPad in order for the commercials to go away. Then when you restart the game you have the same problem. | I have been enjoying this game for months. I have loved it, especially the fact that there were no ads. Now there are ads. Will have to find a new game. | Y‚Äôall gonna lose a lot of players. I swipe the game closed and reopen it to avoid ads but it‚Äôs ridiculous to have to do it after every board play. Too many other games out there with no forced ads! | Game now plays an ad after EVERY level. Ridiculous. | Can‚Äôt build on my game. It got stuck | I play this game all the time, one of my favorites, why do we have ads now ? This is the kind of thing that will make me stop playing | Love this game but way too many ads, might delete üò¢ | This is a fun game but the ads every time you win is aggravating! | This WAS a fun game. Then they inserted ads into every level, whether you beat the level or not!  Absolutely ruined this game. The only option they offer is to pay $10 EVERY MONTH to remove them. It is not THAT fun!  DON‚ÄôT WASTE YOUR EFFORT ON THIS GAME. | When I first started playing this game there were no ads, now I reached a certain level there are add which is annoying. | This game was fun until they decided that an ad after every puzzle was a good idea.  Too many of these games to stick with an obvious money-grab one. | I tried to send an email, but it‚Äôs not revealed or an easy task to find. I truly enjoyed the game until the ads started appearing. Now today, even more ads between reached passed level which is a disappointment. Please see  what would graces been my email below:

To whom it may concern,

Just wanted to shared my feedback with you on the new game update. I understand the goal is to make money from your app, but the forced ads after each level passed is a bit much and off putting. If I wanted to watch an ad to double my coins, at least I have that option. 

This has definitely put a bad taste in my mouth and probably with others as well. I know I‚Äôm just one person writing you and probably won‚Äôt Effect you much if I quit playing, but I least wanted to take the time to give you my personal feedback. | I have been playing this game for a while. I am level 3479 and as of this morning, there are 5 second ads after every level or every time I do one over! Why?? | I like the game but there is way too much ads | Whoever invented this game out did themselves! So much fun. I only have one issue. To get coins it‚Äôs pretty pricey. Other than that, keep doing what your doing. | When I first downloaded this game, I found it to be very refreshing because progress was more skill based, rather than constantly having to pour money into it to move forward. I am about supporting the app, and purchased the Travel Pass each month, but since the the last update, levels take hours, even days to complete. My teams progress in the last battle COMPLETELY disappeared. I‚Äôm ready to delete.
UPDATE: After being stuck on the same level for 2 days, I realized the latest update is a money grab. Like I stated before; I purchased the Travel Pass each month, but I guess that isn‚Äôt enough for the game developers. I am not paying for moves. DELETED. | Therapeutic | Not one ad on Royal Match.  Certainly can‚Äôt say the same about Travel Match.  Ya ruined it | to many ads üëéüèæ | I am truly enjoying this game. Enjoy all the extra Boosters I can get. A lot of games don‚Äôt have enough boosters. That‚Äôs another reason why I love this game! I am getting some ads not really enjoying those but they are very short. Thanks for the awesome gameü§ó | Love the game, but a video after every game you plan is annoying. I am going to cancel because of this. | I love the game I have so much fun playing it . Just wish they remove the ads or not have so much of them",4.78652,4867,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/48/23/2f/48232fa2-3afb-7f75-90ef-77a3006d1e3d/dab70582-3259-4a6e-aee8-c34fa656b3fd_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/83/25/a5/8325a581-6601-e34f-3f3c-0a6cffd65cd8/ee259644-e900-490f-a38a-c0f0a440f865_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/50/ae/19/50ae19a3-fc6d-cdf8-5cf2-d45133085124/09cb4e7c-a128-45a7-bea7-455a8af22039_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a8/33/7f/a8337f1c-457f-fdce-ab32-85d90cc7f46e/f54fc1f0-b1f2-4e83-a77c-072734297d4a_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/93/78/f2/9378f2e0-39ad-f7ba-b247-56514127ea02/6c28a770-e0fe-42a5-848b-0c19d3ae792c_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/2c/48/f4/2c48f47b-4f91-9bfb-0378-23deca203120/58ee256f-f38a-4e05-9314-2d56dd9c83e8_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/de/3b/21/de3b21c3-4155-099b-6033-35c7be3a0178/e2d91f66-bbed-45b0-92fb-cd7547afb22c_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/12/69/6c/12696c58-f8c2-dfc5-fdca-d25912452a01/a7d9cc7d-0e90-415a-8b91-ffbcd2745c00_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/34/50/04/34500411-91b6-a8d5-ba77-59d22ee4f592/c6b5038d-9a10-49e6-8b2a-3fe2255e9792_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/7e/c0/94/7ec09481-a20c-5581-d891-19ceadaadf10/9251d856-e5aa-46ad-8a5d-090b6d813108_7.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

It seems to work ok using a search engine on the internet. | Kinda glitchy, but it gets the job done. Improvements seem to take a long time, but they do come through eventually. | I have used this application for nine(9) expense reports.   Initially there was a problem with reading the title and/or amount.  I captured all the information for the tenth report then generated the report.   It did not email the report as before.  That was no notification of and error.  I tried to generate a report as PDF file.  It would run then error message process was taking too long.  I tried to share the report.   That process seems I generate a PDF before sending.  So, my report is hung-up at TravelBank.  It‚Äôs been over two weeks now without a solution or an expected date for a solution.   I will not trust this application with financial data or processing. | Hot piece of garbage. Buggy, laggy, and very obtuse in its UI. I have not had once pleasant interaction with this company/app/website since our company switched over. | I have had the app for 18 months and it constantly has glitches in the mobile app. Will open and close but not stay open. | No good | Our company is have a lot of trouble with the app. | Love this app and have used it everyday.
Lately, cannot get the app to load - missing my favorite app. | I really need tons of help. Nothing is intuitive. I lose stuff to the Metaverse every time | Since the last update the app will not open. I‚Äôve tried deleting it and reinstalling. It‚Äôs virtually useless if I cannot quickly take a picture of a receipt and load an expense with my phone. | I‚Äôm surprised that I can see my team‚Äôs requests but can‚Äôt approve via the app on my phone!  Not convenient. | I liked this app. I have used it for a year and have all of my spending and receipts on it. It logged me out. I tried to log in and says my password is wrong. I tried to reset the password and it will not send me the email to reset it. Now it tells me I‚Äôm locked out for too many failed attempts and asks me to change my password.

For booking hotels - doesn‚Äôt work

Typing this  review - the words don‚Äôt even show up 

This app is a joke. | Recently I updated the app and at first it was very slow adding expenses. Soon after I was unable to sign in. I attempted to reset several times but never received the email to do so. I checked my trash and junk mail and didn‚Äôt find anything. So now I‚Äôm able to access my Acct. Seems like updates made it worse! | The scan receipts feature is easy to find and use. It automatically fills in merchant details from the picture. Feels modern and intuitive compared to some other tools! | The app is taking forever to load the info of a receipt to update the category. Sometimes it just says error and crashes. Hope I don‚Äôt lose my receipts! | I‚Äôm so glad my company has decided to use travel bank. It has been an excellent experience thus far. | When reserving through the app the hotel loyalty numbers are not transferred to corespondent hotel app and really lose the benefits of direct online checking and points 
Then you have go to front desk like 2 decades ago to add your number to reservation | This app makes documenting expenses for work a breeze and removes the headache with ease!!!! Thanks guys for saving hours of my time!!! -Neil | Had months of records then phone updated and lost everything. Receipts were tossed so lost all those deductions. | Very nice need more topics | Lost all my expenses and receipts for the month. Going to be fun explaining to my employer. Asks me to enter work email and just says error after I hit enter. | I love this app, and the easy to use functions. Makes life easy. | So far a great app.  Would love to see the app be able to enter starting and ending mileage. | Having error when trying to assign credit card sync expense to a report. | Created expense report and submitted - noticed that the date changed on the expense - tried to go in and change - no can do.  Then deleted and created new - it somehow reverted back to date of the deleted one????
Hope it‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs fixed soon | I snapped a receipt. It then immediately pops up asking for the receipt details. What? I tried to skip because I saw a review response that says you just need to save the pic and then everything auto populates. False. I could not move forward without pulling the receipt back out of the trash and entering the details for the app. I tried to enter the event the expense is chargeable to, but only general is an option. I can‚Äôt even create and tag the actual event this expense should be tied to... pointless. | So far so good. Only been using for an hour. | Love it for managing my business travel and expenses!! | Thanks! | Veeeeeeeery baaaaaaaad | Good app with a clean interface. When clicking on the menu to change to a different screen (especially reports) sometimes it does not react well. Also there is no way to undo finalizing a report unfortunately. | This app is great. I use it to keep my receipts organized to make sure I am getting my rewards correctly | Useless app if you are not living the the US. How hard can it be to have the choice to change your default currency into Eur, Jpy or whatever?!?! | Have used it for about two years. Works great. The support team is approachable, which is definitely a plus. 

I do want to suggest, please auto populate the exchange rate. When I am in a country, I have to repeatedly enter the conversion factor for every expense. If it can stay their until I change it, that will be better. | Useless. Freezes at ‚Äúuse Google account.‚Äù | Fix mileage calculation. | Flight shopping is clear and simple. My best options are always visible and details are concise. I like the idea of an all-In-one solution for small and growing companies where time and resources are stretched to their limit. | The UI looks stellar. But their servers never work. I tried booking a flight through them, I kept getting unknown errors, oops errors and so on. Turns out they forgot very basics of enabling CORS on their servers. Their chat support is also very bad. Won't recommend booking with them when you are in an urgency. | Worst customer service and i have been working to get my login issue fixed and nothing has worked till now. Customer service doesn‚Äôt seem to bother to fix my problem and i am in need of urgent requirement to book my ticket | I Love TravelBank! I just booked my trip easily in minutes! I am a new user and can‚Äôt wait to use the expense feature for business travel. | TravelBank is seriously an awesome app. It saves me so much time with expenses. I just snap a picture of the receipt and it does the rest for me. Love saving time üëå | This software is not ideal in the least. You add a receipt by selecting a photo, then they want you to type in the amount and the vendor name. However they way they ha e designed the screen, the photo is now obscured and you can‚Äôt see the amount or the vendor name. This is some stupid design. Very clumsy. I don‚Äôt plant to use it, I will look for something else. | It never loads when I need it to... takes forever.. and ever... | This app is awesome and easy to use. | Easy to use. Powerful for expense tracking and really the best for flights booking. Up to 300 results per flight search!!! Incredible )) All in one for business travelers! | This app is perfect for solopreneurs and small business owners who travel for work. I‚Äôm obsessed and couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without it! | A modern take on an old-school industry, TravelBank allows employees to easily track and submit their expenses. It‚Äôs pretty much the bomb.com | How can this be considered a business app without multi-city bookings?

Want chat support to book it instead, get ready to wait 30min in between responses. They treat chat like email.

(Yes, I travel a lot!).

I emailed Support and haven‚Äôt received a response.  This new app is not as good as the previous one.  Sorry for the poor review as I really used and liked the earlier version! | Multiple steps required- and then the verify email does not work.  Then I get ‚Äò too many tries‚Äô at that verification.   If I was cynical I‚Äôd say the end result is dissuading me from filing a claim , despite having paid a sizable premium. 
Not impressed. | any trip from 2024 past and future did not move to new version 
i hope they can migrate over | no guidance to provide documents for claim | This insurance has become part of my travel pack. great service fast, response time and affordable. Thanks for Allianz! | I am impressed with how easy it is to buy travel insurance.  The policies rates are fair.  I use only Allianze on my international travel. | Unknown why policy when viewed in app cannot be emailed. Error messaging is not clear at all. | Do not waste your money, our flight got canceled due to maintenance and these scum bags didn‚Äôt even try for a second to assist us in anyway. | Very well designed app and website. Easy to find what I needed. | Especially links to documentation information, they do not work. | I find it very confusing to know how to add things to monitor. Such as a car rental, Airbnb, etc. unless I‚Äôm mistaken and it‚Äôs only for flight, I was told by the agent who signed me up that it was trip insurance to cover my trip and that I would be able to have all of my different items in one location so it would be easier to monitor while traveling abroad. The only thing I could find was to add my airline, not the car rental or where I‚Äôm staying. It would be helpful if it was either easier to find to add these items or if it‚Äôs not already an option if it was added so that all of these things (even if they‚Äôre not completely covered), would be listed under one location instead of having to have different apps for everything. | Looking to waste tons of time? This is the app for you! Nothing works and your policy will be wrong. You will be unable to change it but not for lack of trying. | This is the fourth time we‚Äôve used Allianz travel insurance when traveling international. One of the trips, my husband had to go to the doctor twice because he got very sick. Allianz reimbursed us for his dr visits within a day of turning in the receipts. I was very impressed. | I put the TravelSmart app on my phone so I could have the information on my policy during the trip as the paper print out would have been 55 pages. The policy will not print out even though it shows my information and basic coverage. | Renewed an annual policy and although I was emailed a confirmation, it does not appear as a current policy here on the app. | Nice | App does not allow more than one claim.  I have multiple | I have recently been involved in a accident that has put me through a great deal of stress and without a car for the event i got tickets for. With this happening i am forced to work that date to make money and all this is covered under the insurance i purchased through the event yet they make me feel like im a criminal trying to get refund that i paid insurance for in the event something like idk LIFE happens? They are ridiculous and be very careful with this company i have yet to hear back from them, debating on sueing the company. | I purchased the insurance protection for my round trip to Chile.  I am trying to contact you after four hrs waiting setting on the plane. Did found out that the aircraft is having hydraulic problems, as a former aircraft crew chief, the issue is going to take more than the time that they are telling us. This is unacceptable, I do have the issue now and can‚Äôt wait until tomorrow to file a delay flight. 
Please advise 

Thank you | They lead you to believe that if you can‚Äôt attend an event for any reason you‚Äôll be refunded. Lie lie lie! They rip off innocent people thinking they are covered. | A simple 999 dollar mistake? Bought the insurance, booked the flight. Immediately discovered mistake. The so-called Priceline ‚Äúapp deal‚Äù was non-transferable and non-refundable. Really. Does it being legal make it right? | Easy to use appüëç | My husband and I don‚Äôt travel without Allianz travel insurance; they always on point with everything. Excellent service!

Thank you Mrs. Godson | Slow.  Once you make a change can be cumbersome to RE-engage the policy on the web site. | Password is not being saved to my keychain. Have to enter it manually every time. | Website/app is very easy to use and very self-explanatory. Thank you! | It would be helpful to have concierge services available via the app. | This TravelSmart app doesn‚Äôt update to another Apple device even when signing into the same acct with email and passwordüòû | The coverage is a joke. I do not have any 'pre-existing medical conditions'! This is the basis for a $250 refund. I assume that it would be impossible to get a refund otherwise. Why would I get coverage? The small print is astonishing! I will never get reimbursement for anything. You are a bunch of venal individuals who have no integrity. How do you sleep at night? | I renewed my all trips  policy on July 26th and paid the premium. OnAugust 6th I got an email saying ny policy was expiring in 15 days. I checked the app, and sure enough it showed my policy expiring on the 21st. I then logged in on their site, and no record of my renewal. I checked my credit card and it showed the $715 charge had been paid. After a 20 minute telephone call, I learned that the policy number had changed. The lady on the phone said it takes a while for the update to show up on the app and website. She suggested I delete the app and reinstall it to see if the new policy shows up.   Seems like there could be improvements made on the site and app, so transactions show up more quickly and emails are not sent about an expiring policy, two weeks after they‚Äôve been renewed. | I could not email the policy to myself. That app had a problem. | They created this app so they could get more data from you phone. It is a web based app so it actually just runs off their website. No options to opt out of data harvesting. Deleting this after my show claim. Never buying ticket insurance again. If I can‚Äôt go it is easier to just sell the ticket than deal with this company. | Would not use this company filed a claim for lost luggage the day it happened. They were given every documentation required that I had or was given. Continued to deny they received, even when I showed proof they received thru email and uploaded to their website.  After 4 months of going back and forth, still nothing.  They closed the claim, had it reopened after escalation still nothing.  Spent $1000 on the insurance for trip.  Don‚Äôt waste your money too! | What a rip | Just Thank you for being there | Allianz emails me and tells me that my policy expires in two weeks.   Renew. Now!    But there‚Äôs no apparent way to renew with in the app or on  the web site.    Pretty useless. | Allianz has pulled through for me many times on trips. This app makes it possible to have everything at my fingertips. While it‚Äôs still smart to have hard copies of policies and contact information on trips (in case there is no internet connection), the app really makes it possible to get help in a hurry. Great app!  Thanks for providing wonderful service. | Used Allianz before on our Hawaii trip. Claims 
might seem slightly long but was covered across
the board on everything. You will not be disappointed with this company. | Very easy to use, and such a life saver! I would definitely recommend this event insurance to anyone who has a shadow of a doubt that they may not be able to attend their event. It was easy to file a claim without the app, and even easier and more streamlined WITH the app! | Woman in Customer Service located in India spoke so fast could I could not obtain her name but she did accommodate my email change as requested. | What a help for travel!! | Wasn‚Äôt too sure about Spending the extra amount for the insurance because 1 I wasn‚Äôt sure I would need it and 2 because if I did need it, would it actually pay. I‚Äôm very happy to say that they paid and the process from start to finish was super easy and I got my money in a few days. 

One of my return flights from Fresno to Phoenix was canceled which caused me to miss my connecting flight to El Paso on that Sunday night. I had to stay the night in Phoenix (which the airline paid for) so I missed a day of work and it was not a fun situation.  However, Allianz DEFINITELY came through and I will most definitely by buying insurance from now on! | The company makes it seem like you will get reimbursed if you missed your even no matter what..that was not the case..i missed my event due to work related issues and my claim was denied after they gave me the run around for a month..i wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app and the insurance policies | I have been purchasing travel insurance for years. As of beginning of 2023, this app stopped working. It no longer updates with new policies purchased through the airlines. 
I can find the policy via web, but when the app tries to update it throws an error and asks that we call Allianz. Defeats the purpose. | Worthless  Does not save information added?? | No complaints so far! | Took the info from our Viking travel plan, and entered it. That easy. | It was easy to set upüëçüèº | The biggest downfall of your app is you can‚Äôt find it by typing ‚ÄúAllianz‚Äù into the search box.  All you would need to do is title it ‚ÄúAllianz‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúTravel Smart‚Äù. | App doesn‚Äôt send alerts when policy is about to expire,so you can renew,

Because this is not a ‚Äúhappiest‚Äù experience. | LOVE THIS!!!! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®ü§©ü§© | This was my family‚Äôs first ever experience at Disneys magic kingdom and first time at Disney all together! We were highly let down. Food venders didn‚Äôt open til afternoon but the park opened at 8a. Bathrooms were far and few, food was mediocre and overpriced. I get that this is Disney world and it is pricey to be here but there was only like hot dogs, burgers and fajitas. What happened to pizza and chicken tenders!? Then to top it off there is only like 5 or 6 adult rides in the whole park. Magic kingdom is beautiful but it should be specifically stated that it‚Äôs more for younger children families not teens. For all the money my family spent this experience was definitely not worth it. for the price of admission no characters where available for pictures throughout the park‚Ä¶I felt things ran unorganized by staff in certain areas of the park with the rides. We came to have the ultimate experience and this definitely wasn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶.at this point I‚Äôll save my money and go to 6 flags as we already drove all this way from Chicago to be disappointed | Complex. Impossible to use. | Wish there was a better way to use the Genie or even get access to it. Fast Passes use to be great and now you gotta pay (shocker). Still a magical place just expensive as all get out. | I came to Magic Kingdom with my family on vacation 3/28/24 and every time I wanted to schedule a time for a ride it said we weren‚Äôt eligible. I found the process for purchasing a genie plus reservation was very difficult. I had just came from universal studios the 2 days before and was very impressed with their fast track system, whereas at Disney, we had to make appointments. I truly believe that if this system is changed, in the future, things would work out for the best. We didn‚Äôt have the best time at Disney Magic kingdom at all. Thank you for listening. | Everything about Disney is unnecessarily  complicated and  hard to navigate- including the app. We had several syncing errors despite calling Disney guest services for help. | For how much money we pay for everything you would think of a better way to make an app. I just want to see the rides I booked. Not all the recommendations. Put what I booked upfront not 3 clicks away. Everyone will ask the time to book next or the time to p | Virtual queue had an error right at 7 am | This app is not at all helpful, I can only seem to schedule one day, then I can‚Äôt seem to do anything else whether it is reserve dining or get any information on Genie +. You-tube is much more helpful, I feel like this trip is going to be a disaster and I‚Äôve already paid for it. I will consider Universal in the future | Not removing an entertainment from my day I no longer want that as part of that days plan but it says error when processing my request to remove from my day. I have updated the app and tried removing for two days with no luck. | Why is everything so complicated? | Very easy to use | App is super confusing..... lots going on.... I miss the paper ticket days! | This app is bloated and slow. Takes forever for anything to load. Basically unusable.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling as suggested and it seems like it made it worse. | Within 1 min it got close for online queue | Very Helpful! | Ridiculous wait time there should be a lower population per day to insure people can actually ride a dam ride for a $170 ticket for a day admission. | Say they go through and then go missing | After 140 minutesandno Genie available I wonder if purchasing Genie was a rip off | It‚Äôs expensive but making many incredible memories | This app crashes frequently and also failed to transfer all of my tickets to the Apple wallet but it turns out you don‚Äôt need the wallet like the app suggests. Maybe go back to mailing out magic bands? Now I‚Äôm not sure my tickets on the app will get me into the park as only half of my family is showing. ‚ÄúVacation‚Äù hasn‚Äôt started and I‚Äôm already stressed out with my hour on the phone with tech support and still having the same problem. Just email me the tickets please! | Our tickets are refusing to be recognized. We have been to concierge so no early pass for us. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI have to do everything manually | Everything has been great, All Star Sports Resort is very nice, super clean and convenient with the shuttle. Close to McDonald‚Äôs too. Airport is very nice too. Everyone we encountered has been so helpful and friendly. | It‚Äôs more complicated to book a Disney trip than it is to buy a house. Enough. | App is cool by being able to see what wait times are | Won‚Äôt let me use app without oking google maps. | 1. Magic band so far not very useful. Hard to pair, will not stay on turns off after two minutes as a result will not stay paired when bend automatically shuts down.

2. Going with family gave them my 6 digit Disney ID they used it to make reservations for fireworks and dinner Friday night. Their future plans do indicate I‚Äôm one of the guests for the reservations. Nothing shows up in my future plans but my hotel reservation. 

Very frustrating. | Absolutely wonderful vacation with 3 generations of family members.  Disney significantly surpassed our expectations.  All the staff were extremely friendly and there were endless fun activities.  Everything was very clean. There was so much magical fun it made this 72 year old grandmother feel youthful again.  We had ages from 3 on up. Very highly recommend for memorable family vacations. | Cool and great! | . | Great map | What a wonderful time we are experiencing at WDW!! Everyone is so helpful and we feel so blessed to be camping here for the week. | Beautiful All Star Music resort. May want to have some ‚Äúlive‚Äù music a couple nights.  Parks clean. Very accommodating for handicap and special needs. Warm memories that fills you up. Food plan was a fabulous idea! May need some time to recover from this 4 day adventure, but we will be back! Thx! | Waiting for 5 mins still no one has opened chat! | App keeps crashing,Turns on and off and won‚Äôt work | Cannot get access to purchase disney bands through link in chat. | App is difficult to navigate, making it difficult to locate items such as your room key with ease. | Kane was very nice and helpful on the phone when we needed assistance with sharing our passes with our friends | Every time we go to a ride it‚Äôs temporary closed | Near perfect. The only issue we had with the app is the map because it doesnt always flip map orientation its very difficult to naviagate. Left is right and right is left. Other than that amazing experience. | Was on queue for Tron (the only ride i wanted to go on bad) ALL DAY, and then when it‚Äôs finally my turn, only my friend could go bc apparently my queue was linked to hers?? Really unfair because while i was ‚Äúin queue‚Äù (all day) i couldn‚Äôt have even joined another one if i wanted to and the text where the button for that would be was labeled ‚Äújoined queue‚Äù. a BUNCH of other people had the same problem and it‚Äôs so messed up. they need to change the queue mechanic and interface. | My husband & I loved our stay at Saratoga Springs. We weren‚Äôt sure how we would do in a studio for 21 days but it was perfect, especially our 4th floor room in Paddock, overlooking the pool. The only thing that could have made the stay better is Pickleball courts on property. I never saw anyone playing tennis, time to make those clay courts into pickleball courts!!
All cast members and support staff were excellent!
We will be back next year! | Room was supposed to be ready before 3 and it still isn‚Äôt. Room was supposed to be adjoined and isn‚Äôt.
Very disappointing | It works so well. We have high speed reception even works in no data areas. Love it 100% for all park goers! | The app can be difficult to use and navigate. Magic in the parks is wonderful and I would give that an A+. It‚Äôs just the app that can be a little difficult. If you find yourself needing help with the app while in the park, find a ticket booth. They were very helpful! | Amazing | This is our home away from home! Love coming to Disney each year. Been coming here since I was a kid. Love each and every minute. Thank you cast members. You are the magic! | I love it and it helps me find the place where I need to go and it is so

I‚Äôm on this app a lot more than instagram and twitter (X) | U need to be 12+ for the app and I put age which is 14 but it says I can‚Äôt use the app | The devs and ToS require users to be 18+ yet IOS store says 12+.

Sincerely,THE PERSON WHO REALLY WANTED THIS APP!üò° | There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the app but the content creators on it. There is a lot of misinformation and toxic content. There‚Äôs people promoting eating disorders. Lots of misinformation when it comes to losing weight, workouts, etc. I would never suggest this app to anyone because it seems like a lot of young uneducated people use it and those trying to be influencers. | As you see, it says 12 and plus I mean this looks like a great app but when you put your I can assure you I am older than 12 and it‚Äôs still not working.

It helped me take good care of myself and helped me feel better about myself lemon8 is one of the best apps I have ever had!! | This app says the age limit is 12 but I put in my age which I much higher ther this and it will not let me in. I‚Äôve tried to reinstall it multiple times and it still doesn‚Äôt seem to work. If anyone else is having or had this problem then write a review on how you solved it or how you‚Äôre trying to fix it. | I first got influenced on TikTok because it was all over my fyp . So I decided to check it out, when I first downloaded the app it told me to put my date of birth and I put in 2005 because that‚Äôs my birth year and it said ‚Äú You are not eligible for the app, thank you for checking us out‚Äù and I even deleted it and tried again and still didn‚Äôt work. | I can‚Äôt even access this app because I am ‚Äúnot old enough.‚Äù I am 13 and the age limit says you have to be twelve. I‚Äôm not sure what age they want you to put in but make sure you consider this before downloading the app. | Lemon 8 is a lovely app I love using it to connect with others and to find some new friends. It‚Äôs a good way to find new hobbies and new favorite music. You can express your self really well in all the posts you want to make it‚Äôs really fun. It‚Äôs a great app to have as a tween and teen. | It does not let me sign in at any age whatsoever | Love the app a lot üôÇ | THIS WILL NOT LET ME EVEN LET ME PUT MY AGE IN BECAUSE IT SAYS ‚ÄúIM NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS APP DIE TO MY AGE ‚Äú LIKE WHAT! | If you are tired of social media drama come to lemon8 for just that. | This app is amazing, if you like Pinterest you would love this app. | Would be better if you could add a song | New to this platform, and per usual when it comes to me and my relationships with social media I was timid. Algorithms typically frighten me but this one seems more inviting and approachable than ones of the past. Not sure who the coders or investors are but I feel like they did an adequate job with this one. ü§ó | I love the positivity n everything on this app, but I‚Äôve noticed a huge amount of clearly underage children on the app, talking abt things they‚Äôre not supposed to, bein rude n bullying others, etc. And several times I‚Äôve reported them and they tell me ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt found anything wrong.‚Äù Are you guys even looking? Are you even checking the accounts reported? There are so many adult posts on here n stuff that kids just in general shouldn‚Äôt be seeing. Love the app but this really needs to be looked into. | So I got the app and I am well over 12. I am 16 and I put in that exact day my exact birthday and everything in the app is 12+ when I downloaded the app it says my age is not eligible for it so this is making me really frustrated and I hope Lemon8 can fix this problem ‚ù§Ô∏è | I put in my real birthdate and it said I wasn‚Äôt eligible for the app. I am of age. I kept scrolling a year back and nothing worked. A whole millennial ago, I was still too young. | When I put my age in as 13 it wouldn‚Äôt let me in saying I wasn‚Äôt eligible even though it says 12+ and when I tried using a different year such as 1990 it wouldn‚Äôt work either saying I wasn‚Äôt eligible and so on | I really want to sign up for lemon8 app but it‚Äôs didn‚Äôt let me sign in, it‚Äôs says ‚Äúsorry, looks like you‚Äôre not eligible for lemon8‚Ä¶but thanks for checking us out!‚Äù. Like‚Ä¶can you fix it? | FIX YOUR APP or change the rating. This is clearly a app for teens fix your rating/app policies the majority of your downloads are from under 18 anyway.

This is a scam and quite disturbing! | Often have lots of points but no point rooms available thinking of going to another priority club | Clean and nice rooms, front desk and hotel workers all kind and helpful.  Beds very comfortable and breakfast tasty. Last night in Santa Fe and was really impressed with front desk manager‚Äôs helpfulness Ant ( sp?) | You are gonna get a call after you book an IHG room from Holiday Inn Club Vacations . Don‚Äôt sign up for a discounted vacation. It‚Äôs a scam scam scam for a timeshare company. You pay 249 bucks for a vacation to book later. But there‚Äôs tons of taxes and fees later to book it. Yuck | Pets allowed filter checkbox should be front & center right below number of persons. See Hotels dot com website. Also on credit card info you should add month number next to month name. Your app has only month name. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but the booking experience would be 10 times better with these to simple fixes. | These hotels have always been there for me and my family, I continue to depend on staying with IHG anywhere I go on vacation or just going for a weekend trip. Best places, breakfast is a plus for us and the comfortable beds and clean rooms. The hotels are also always clean and I‚Äôm always welcomed when I enter the hotel. That‚Äôs why I recommend any family and friends to stay there. And the prices for staying are outstanding. | Very easy to navigate such as pre booking, perks and all the information needed. Perks are amazing and no hoops to jump through. | The room was excellent. !! Well thought out arrangement and most comfortable bed, sheets and pillows. !! Thank you. !! We will come back again. !! Breakfast was great and Brooke our hostess was the best. !! | All good no problems using this for reservations‚Ä¶ | IHG has always made it very easy to book your hotel stay through them. The app is very user friendly and tells you of any additional fees, for example some locations charge a daily parking fee depending on what city or town you are traveling to, alls you have to do is read! All the information you need to know is told upfront to you. | Love it here clean always | Over many years IHG will not let me have anymore than 1 night on points üëé | Shady business practices with points program | Great Work Always !! | I love IHG as a brand and have stayed in its hotels in multiple countries, but this app is all show and little substance. The details as to which amenities are available are confined to a handful of words and photos focus on glamor shots at the expense of actual information. For instance, a ‚Äú360 degree tour‚Äù of one of its NYC room doesn‚Äôt even show you the bathroom. In addition, most photos of the bathrooms‚Äîwhen they even exist‚Äîshow, again, closeups of the mirror or sink. I live in Asia where bathtubs aren‚Äôt commonly available and like to choose places where I can enjoy them when I travel, but good luck finding out if IHG hotels even have them in most sites. 
Finally, when you tap on a room‚Äôs pics, it redirects you to the entirety of that site‚Äôs photos, from entrance to bars and penthouse photos‚Äînot exactly conducive to making an educated choice about which room you actually want to choose. This is likely a lazy developer‚Äôs choice rather than a strategic move, and it needs fixed immediately.
IHG, your hotels themselves and customer service therein are excellent and feel like a great mix of style and comfort. Please make an app that feels the same, and fulfills its purpose: to give clients the needed information to book a room that fits their needs. Enough with the useless, fancy closeups, unless you‚Äôre selling the towels, and not the room itself. Please list ALL amenities, including bathtubs, and provide more thorough photos that show the tubs or showers in their entirety, not just half-shots that repeatedly show them from midpoint up. | I love IHG it‚Äôs convenient and easy to use. All stays have been a great experience!!! | Unlike some apps, reward nights don‚Äôt require any extra effort.  Just choosing a rewards night from other payment options is very convenient. | N Conway is a great travel destination and our stay at Holiday Inn Express is icing on the cake. | Changing the password does work well. | Price, great.  Cleanliness, can‚Äôt get better than that.  Pleasure, always!  This is our favorite hotel chain to stay in when traveling anywhere. | I love the user friendly app to make bookings 24/7 | The app works great. Great features and easy tonuse | Three room types:  1 King Standard, 2 Queen Standard, and Standard.  No clue what the last one means.
Not much else to check out. | I always get really high rates on the ihg app and im a member and other platforms get me fair ones | Very clean hotel, very nice staff. | Very disappointed of the Holliday Inn  loyalty program. Also found a lot of the staff in South Florida will terrible attitude. Hilton brand does a way better job with a lots of different hotels to chose from, and a great loyalty program. | Do not hesitated ,if you plan to go to Tallahassee best place to stay,great team and very clean,Hayleigh she‚Äôs very respectful!!! | From the moment we checked in everything was great, especially Vanessa, who helped me load up the IHG app. Best shower ever with great pressure. Very comfortable room and excellent breakfast bar. So good, we extended our stay. | Would not accept valid Amex but too Citi MC??? | De verdad que muy amigable el app y f√°cil de usar. Me gusta porque hay buenos precios y variedad de productos. Muchas Gracias. | IHG app makes booking rooms easier. I am traveling 2 to 3 weeks a month sometimes at short notice. The IHG app on the phone works great. | Enjoy our stays with IHG | I always enjoy IGH | This was my first stay, and Walnut Creek, this is a great hotel. This hotel provides great value for the price, safe environment with easy parking, and a hot breakfast. The staff is wonderful! | A quick book thing came up and when I tried to close the window it booked the room!  Even worse, it booked at my last rate, which is higher than the rate on the website. Won‚Äôt let me cancel even though I never wanted the room. Beware! | cant stand the insane amount of pop ups and questions about promotions and deals, just muddys up trying to book a room | Me he Hospedado en este hotel 3 Veces al a√±o, desde el l 2020 siempre he tenido una buena experiencia. | Simple and easy to use | Straight forward while giving you membership options and benefits! | The process of booking my reservation was superb! | I have enjoyed my stays at this hotels chain | I love using the Bluetooth keys for my hotel rooms. In this app, in order to enable that feature, you have to set up two-step verification. When I did that I was locked out of the app. When I called tech-support, they told me that there‚Äôs a mandatory five day lockout whenever anyone adds two step verification. I run a big software development team, and if they implemented a feature like this, I would fire them the same day. I think two step verification is a good thing, but a five day lockout? Not happy today. | I was happy to see how easy it was to get a room for this eveningüìû | Great way to book a room | THANK YOU SO MUCH for bringing back the past stays map!!!  I am a Roadtripper so love seeing where I‚Äôve been!  üòÉ | We better than Priceline lol!!! | Keep getting locked out of my account and now my account was lost somehow. I stay often for work and now I‚Äôve lost over 100k points. Try to stay with Hilton as much as possible. I‚Äôve never had any issues with my rewards there | I have been traveling for 20+ years and have enjoyed using IHG exclusively for this time. I enjoy the benefits, the ease of booking the rooms, and ease of using the app. The hotels are clean, neat with friendly service. The hot breakfast is a great benefit as well. Great place for business or personal. | I constantly have to make two reservations when I want to modify | IHG makes it difficult to book because I use a rewards account that I made and has my wife's name on it.  So far they won‚Äôt let us change the name, and it makes it hard for me to check in.

Never again!!! | I want to share my experience, my friend and I bought international tickets from this program, but unfortunately after 24 hours no one responded and they did not refund my money. Be very careful with this program so that you don't have any problems. I think there is no reliable company or person for this program ,,, | Excellent , I love it | It‚Äôs alway a pleasure booking with you all ‚ù§Ô∏è | I booked a flight through this app. But after few days got an email saying the airline has cancelled all its flights. Now the agent from OneTravel does not give any solutions on this. I can‚Äôt call to a USA number for reschedule from another country because of high price. Service from OneTravel is so bad. This seems like a scam to me. I lost my money. Avoid this scam app. | Phenomenal | Good | I was trying to flight back to the US from overseas after a few years of working. Decided to try this app. I books 6 months in advance with flexible additional charges in case something happened. Something happened and I tried removing someone from the flight. Horrible customer service. Used all the services to then cancel. After trying to cancel, it charged me the price of the one ticket that I was going to change. From 1200 to a 600 dollar refund. Bad luck. | Your representative who rang me was the most condescending and rude individual I‚Äôve ever dealt with | So, I was able to book an out of the country ticket and even purchased a travel insurance on the ticket just in case I was unable to make my flight. When I reached out to One Travel they told me that not only was I unable to cancel the ticket without penalty but that they would be charging me to make changes!!! Oh, it get better‚Ä¶. After an hour on the phone with them and getting charged a fee they told me that they were unable to make changes and that I would have to call the airlines myself!!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ oh and that‚Äôs not all‚Ä¶. When I reached the airline they booked me threw, in order to change the itinerary, it was literally for another full price ticket!!!üò§üò§üò§ So much for having a good rate on a flight!!! First and last time I will be using One travel to book a flight!!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! | If you love travel use one travel and stay at Sundancer Lombok Indonesia code word: DoggyDao üòé | As of Jan 2023, I cannot login into my account via this app. I enter in my email and password on the app but will not go beyond that once I click to sign in. I can view my account & upcoming flights just fine on my desktop, just cannot log into via this mobile phone app. | First time and I love it everything is fast and very easy to read. | My sit was wrong an I paid for it both flights | Every time the search results come up it‚Äôs for the wrong state, and or number of travelers. I always double check and confirm the information prior to submitting and I get the wrong results. Very annoying. | The online service is wonderful to use having been my first time to schedule this flight. | Solo falta que est√© en espa√±ol | I purchased a flight for one day i never recived confirmation and one day before the flight i found out it was book the wrong date so i lost my money and i coulbt get ahold of anybody big dissapoiment | Buena pagina para comprar | Nice apps | Their cancelation policy is 24hrs after booking, tried to chat with an agent and he said it was airline policy which is not very true since my flight is months away and if i booked through their website directly they would have let me cancel. I guess i wont be making that mistake again. I also had a hard time even finding my itinerary on the app and website, it would say i had no upcoming trips, and it would just direct me to covid 19 page. Wont be using again | I called yesterday and today and both time i was talking with the agent for over 60 minutes and at the end the result was 0 zero. The did not helped me in any way. They just want to take your money and nothing else. For anything you call they will charge using different names. | Wow - got a fantastic deal on the dates I wanted to travel and it included travel insurance for a tiny fee.  Am so chuffed to finally be able to get on a plane again and go see friends!
Thanks for great service!!! | Don‚Äôt ever buy your tickets with onetravel. I bought my tickets in 2020 and due to COVID-19 they didn‚Äôt refund my money. In 2021 i bought two more tickets in USA and due to a bad weather in Denver , they didn‚Äôt refund and they didn‚Äôt even inform me about the cancellation. What an unprofessional business. Never ever in my life by tickets with you guys. You are the worst company i ever work with.  Very unprofessional,  if i could get a -1 minus stars i would give it to you. | Great app I‚Äôve been using it for years | I booked this before Covid spread as bad as it is and they won‚Äôt refund or allow for a future flight. I‚Äôll not use this again. | Tkyuo üòå | I have traveled all over the world using this agency and they have never done me wrong . Love you travel one !!! | Booked but the site changed my airport called right away was told there would not be a charge to correct had to fight hours on phone to get a billing and I was charged the change fee. Now have to wait for some supervisor to call flight time changed 2 weeks after booking not the time I would have booked hours to get answered from people who drop the call and you can barely hear or understand.  Run.  I really mean it run away from this site go to the airline directly. This one is terrible!!! Run! | This is the worst booking site. They didn‚Äôt even ask for passage information nor did they ask to confirm the information. When I called the number they had down to call for help changing name on flight the person said I can‚Äôt change any information because it was a super saver ticket. Why would that even matter. Don‚Äôt deal with OneTravel they scam you. | Ca | Round trip flight to LA for AORN conference which was canceled due to Covid 19 still have not received refund | I was unaware that they were going to have to verify my flight by calling my bank before I got my tickets and the guy hung up in the middle of the call and I am unable to get ahold of anyone and I am sitting at the airport with no tickets | You guys are inconsiderate I | I tried for week to chat talk email about my modification to my flight on March 26th. No response from anyone. Very frustrated now would like a reply. Been on hold for 3 hrs time. Please assist me needs. sincerely Daniel Lee Huber Silver status Booking number 67424375... | Great Prices! Thanks | I booked a reservation through what I thought was the airline. It was travelone. Now because of the corona virus, it is necessary to not make the trip. No phones are answered. No help. | Great app | Must say the two flights i booked went fine but the dang app will NOT go away! Every time I open yahoo the app comes up . I have deleted several times it but that doesn‚Äôt work. How the heck do i get it to GO AWAY!!? | üòé | Booking was super easy, and convenient | I booked through what I thought was the airline.  Ended up with Travel One/Cheap airfare.  Conversation very difficult.  Then once cancelled I received an email that said cancellation was not complete until a final step with ‚Äúotp-onetime password‚Äù was made. Through the app, I chatted with someone who said they could see it was cancelled by my confirmation #.  I questioned was the additional step with otp not needed as suggested by their email.  They then asked what the # was  so to update.  I gave it to them and then was asked if I needed anything else?  I feel if I had just taken their word and not questioned the need for the ‚Äúotp‚Äù. They would have in fact not cancelled My rez and by the time I realized this would have been told a ridiculous cancellation fee.  Long story short- felt very scam like! Always deal directly with airline/hotel | Idk but this site must have a small business owner. To verify your account they call you and say what‚Äôs the phone number to account then proceed to say ok we have to call you back at this number to verify payment please  answer. Then they call back as if everything is verified whole time no receipt still & no money has been taken out account. Next morning I get an email saying your flight amount has changed. Fort Lauderdale flight went from $115 one way to $485. Lolll I canceled of course total b.s and a waste of time now I have to keep eye on my card because the whole process was just weird to me . DONT USE READ FINE PRINT!!!! | All details are vague and I‚Äôm pretty sure I was bumped down, but I have no way to prove it | I wanted to use my Paypal account to purchase a ticket on short notice. It worked out perfectly. | Not very good customer service. My ticket was so messed up the woman told me to call United. I should have just called them in the first place. Never again will I use this service. | 65140946 booking reference I‚Äôm really unhappy with the way your agency refused to help me out when my son reached the airport 2pm for the 2:55 flight to USA. 

The airlines counter did not take him for the flight, and then refused to rebook him on the next flight and when I called your agent she told me to pay additional 800/- or so to book for the next day.  Now you say I‚Äôve lost the return flight also....this is seriously ridiculous and just trying to rob people of their hard earned money.......

I WILL NOT BOOK WITH ONE TRAVEL ANYMORE I HAVE LEARNT MY LESSON NEVER TO TRUST YOUR AGENCY AGAIN. | Lowest price of air ticket for Minneapolis MN-Phoenix AZ round trip.
I recommend oneTravel, all US cities prices-oneTravel is recommendable | I love how easy it is to arrange for my travels with the itinerary I want and everything else.

I don‚Äôt like how certain things cost money. The app also kicks me out sometimes. | Why is it so hard to access the map for adding more cities??? | Very misleading I paid for addons and it still doesn‚Äôt  work - don‚Äôt waste your money on this stupid app it looks nice but it‚Äôs not interactive and there is hardly any content | I didn‚Äôt realize there was 107 states according to your info. I would think you‚Äôd be able to track states as well not just cities.  Shame on you! | Not all of the National Parks are enabled. I tried 3 different national parks and they wouldn‚Äôt come up and allow me to mark them. I purchased the park add on and they aren‚Äôt in it. The map is very small. Would be great to have a full screen ability. | This app is not user friendly. It doesnt allow you to choose the country if you dont choose a city. Also, Bermuda is nonexistent (its there as a country but you cant choose it since there isnt an identifiable city). I‚Äôve spent additional to add-ons. It would also be great if there could be a running list of the places given instead of only showing it on the world map.This app could be better if they made some tweaks. | A compelling app, easy to use. | Serously...is everything behind a pay wall? How do you add the countries you've been to or want to go to? You would think that would be the absolute most obvious thing to do with this app, but it's nowhere to be found. What a disappointment. | Not easy to use on iPhone or iPad. Can‚Äôt just get a list. Doesn‚Äôt sync between both. Sorry I paid the money | I can not find a simple listing of places, perhaps organized by category. | I had high hopes for this app; especially when I paid for the full upgrade. I regret ever downloading this. When it says that you can add your own ‚Äúsmall‚Äù places to the cities map - beware. It is not at all what I thought it would be. Needless to say, I have had no luck adding my own locations as specified in the description. This is such a bummer. Do not waste your money and time and energy like I did. | We need more places in Antarctica. There are many more stations in Antarctica to visit! | While this may be one of the better apps for this, that says mire about the other apps not being so great that this one being good.  UI and how things are organized is mediocre and when you are your map with someone it is static - they won‚Äôt see anything else you add unless you send again.  Also, when they look at your map they will see pins where you have been but when they zoom in to see what the pin is on everything continues to get smaller making it virtually impossible to know what the location is.  Lastly, as of this writing the app has not been updated in 10mos.  It is owned by a company and is not getting much love.  I submitted a support email a few days ago and no reply yet. | New river gorge nation park (USA) is not able to select on a map.
Two much of everything but I have not yet found a better app for my needs (to pin places rather than cities) | Some of the places i been to are difficult to locate on map.  you can sites i visited, but i can locate | After spending hours and hours loading my data it all disappeared.  There is no intuitive login for the app.  A login only shows up in settings when you try to backup your data and it only links to your google account.  I tried to use the app on my ipad and logged in with google account.  Guess what!  it over wrote my iPhone app with the ‚Äúnew‚Äù data from the ipad, which was nothing.  Now I have NO DATA on either the iPhone or the ipad app.  What a joke.  This was after buying the airports and parks etc.  BEWARE!!!!!!!! | Paid to be allowed to add my own locations, then I can‚Äôt add my own location.  Not pleased. | Many large cities are not available to choose? Unless you upgrade to a paid version | Advertises as much more inclusive of places represented, I.e. UNESCO sites, national parks, airports, etc. everything is a costly add on, including each country NPS. | Good app for tracking places been. Just be aware that you will be nickeled and dimed for every feature even if you purchase Pro+. 

Needs to add a feature to add airports like you can with small cities. | Very useful app but I always get an error when I try to back up to the Places Been serve. What‚Äôs wrong with the server? | Too many additional purchases are required And typos in the names of national monuments. | where‚Äôs niagra falls :population about 80,000 | I purchased the US National Parks but I can‚Äôt figure out how to access it. There‚Äôs no explanation whatever so ever. Just totally wasted money | I LOVE THIS APP, im already planning so many trips by this app, HOWEVER... there are WAY too many purchases on this app, i bought the pro+ version thinking i would get everything (national parks, airports, UNESCO sites, etc) however that wasn't the case. they are relatively cheap purchases, but i only ended out buying the US national parks and the Pro+ version. maybe add a purchase that does everything for 9.99$? and there is just so many alternatives for apps like this that are FREE. But very easy to navigate, LOVE the add on cities editions, and i plan on using this app for a very long time. | I really love the app, and tracking is easy and fun. | When I tried to add certain cities the app crashed every time, and now the app crashes anytime I try to open the cities section. | Wasted money on this. It doesn‚Äôt populate with my iCloud data or my google account. I upgraded to pro+ and nothing changed. In fact, the app would let me keep paying for an upgrade if I were stupid. What gives? | This app is cool | Cities recently disappeared after lots of time logging them. Might have changed Maps clients or might be a bug I don‚Äôt know.",4.56221,651,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/5b/65/d2/5b65d219-b556-13fd-93bb-e7d2e759bd54/ba957901-6c88-4164-83fe-74c809f09d76_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_0.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/57/c4/be/57c4be72-8d51-8daf-d799-409cda7d79fb/998293f5-37dd-4d55-82b6-b2b5c31909e5_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/98/c2/03/98c20394-0642-4900-1893-7058f6bf43a8/0a60028e-5fa9-4cda-aef8-8a328c2e2d8f_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/cb/cf/f3/cbcff363-0c6e-12e1-8c1c-9b13b3fd159e/3363f94e-6de3-4f73-8d28-abe18ad61cc3_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/d5/d7/e0/d5d7e045-169e-2c6f-1231-2306337a45e2/201f6937-73b0-4f49-8d8c-466921b60ecf_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/25/a8/a0/25a8a0af-555f-39d2-88d4-79792853dff6/d227c79b-8e4b-4e83-b2ad-5e953e9c4bdb_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/20/3e/45/203e45e5-6f12-e284-ff2a-9f8673875b0d/aa175897-102e-467a-92e4-b6f8a21b9a8a_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/cd/91/e6/cd91e61f-8366-59f5-287f-549a4be0eab3/496b0f81-3887-4511-b8ff-14294579bdf0_Apple_iPhone_8_Plus_Screenshot_7.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/29/46/59/2946591c-490e-6fcc-9553-bd33e35d40e2/3b696df3-2f2c-49c0-9c81-d303ec32bc33_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_0.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/71/f5/55/71f55581-f2a6-68b2-b870-36dddbb6e75c/dd03d35b-617f-432a-9615-f8fd34775729_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/76/2e/39/762e39e3-e046-fe64-7979-5a4dacf2f38c/4c4e563f-cafa-4053-87e5-1f78b405e4aa_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/23/ce/73/23ce73c4-14f6-9457-b3d3-346c3b70a1f7/35707d7b-ce59-4a97-a483-7c6fb2fb08e1_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/63/83/2d/63832d15-dfb7-4230-062b-71c558351c6c/1f963c55-b943-4326-adb7-9d7e5bf83946_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/ba/08/4f/ba084f3e-49e2-e496-5cdb-95760560d67f/c738a766-db1b-477e-8083-5429603b1be4_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_5.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/f0/9a/46/f09a46d6-d460-7f4e-8d46-58443d713e43/29ec7fe0-5df2-4da6-9379-2445cf99ba0a_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/e5/6d/ad/e56dadce-aa6f-ee1e-9d77-eebb53c143c1/d0f89662-e741-4a9e-b2af-6d51426de1f5_Apple_iPad_Pro_13_Inch_Screenshot_7.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cel

Journi GmbH needs to provide a way to use the standard iOS ‚Äúphoto picker‚Äù so we can access photos in shared albums!! (Please?) When we go on a trip, everybody traveling together puts their favorite photos into a shared album, but shared albums are inaccessible with Journi! I know they have their own ‚Äúshared photos‚Äù solution that they think is sufficient, BUT IT‚ÄôS NOT. (People don‚Äôt want to deal with other apps and ‚Äúspecial instructions‚Äù.) It‚Äôs enough of a challenge to get folks to add photos to an iOS shared album (and that only takes a few taps!) Other apps on the App Store allow access to the built-in shared albums so it‚Äôs not a technical limitation. There have been lots of updates to the app in the years since I initially mentioned this but it continues to be ignored. üò¢ | I have used other methods, but on a three week trip, this was the best. Seamlessly integrated, my photos were entered with my dialogue easily. You do have word limits, which in my case may actually be a good thing! But since my photos overflowed the allotted area ( limited to 10 per post)and made new pages, it allowed me to add more description, which replaced lack of being able to put titles on photos. I saw that as one drawback initially. It makes a book for you, but is quite good initially, and you do have some amount of creative control to move and edit photos. My only frustration with that is that sometimes I would like to swap a photo in a layout to a totally different location, but you are limited to their options. One other thing developers might address is if there is a dialogue box and the chosen preferred layout,  if  the slightest change is made to the dialogue, it changes the whole layout! Back to choosing a layout! All in all, I am very pleased with this app! The quality of the book I had printed was also first rate, if a bit pricey. I will use again, and have recommended to others. | Hello Journi Team,
Do you take under consideration to add more stamps? I would be interested in USA states stamps and also US National Parks stamps. A lot of people travels to USA to visit national parks and different states.

Thanks | Still trying to find an app that allows me to journal, add some photos and share with friends. This on another app that is NOT that. Sigh. Will continue my search. Ciao app‚Äî‚Äî- | Almost exactly what I have been looking for. Great way to share travel experiences and just photos but also narrative and timelines. So much better than overwhelming family and friends with photo dump via text messages. Several enhancements to add to your product development roadmap:
1. It would be amazing if I could share videos and just just photos. 
2. Another suggestion is to add ability to view without downloading the app. So if I share with older relatives who are technologically challenged they could see it without having to go through app download.
3. Dictation capability so descriptions can dictated instead of typing | Daughter went to the trouble to blog her entire trip on this website and then to get the book printed is outrageously expensive. | Well, I guess this is one less travel journal I have now, since you took away the way I sign in (Facebook). I might come back if you decide to put it back, but until then, see you never! üò†üò°üëéüèª | I wanted to love the app.  I joined Journi just days before leaving on my trip and have been stranded with little or no help for 2 weeks. The bot is useless.  When I hear from a person 3 days later, it is another 3 days and 4 request later and then the same runaround again.  There is no online help.  The Journi.zen desk seems to focus on helping you print a book - NOT why I subscribed to upper tier. About to loose any chance of journaling my month long trip and asking for my money back.  Frustrated and disappointed. | My husband, granddaughter & I are on a 10 day trip to London & Paris.  I wanted to be able to document the trip & share the pics & commentary with friends.  Journi gives you that option.  I had a little trouble setting it up but with the help of my granddaughter it is working smoothly.  Friends & family have enjoyed it.  Thank you! | I can‚Äôt travel but my friend and her husband show me it every day of their trip! I appreciate it | I am | I wish Incould add screen shot & videosI to my blogs | If it weren‚Äôt for journi, I would forget so many travel memories that we‚Äôve spent time and money on. And the best part is we can log our photos without being obnoxious on Facebook or Instagram. Just letting our close friend and family follow what we‚Äôre up to. Best app. Have gotten so many traveling friends hooked on Journi. | I absolutely love this app! It‚Äôs amazing to record my highlights of my trips and to share with friends! I love that every Journi has its own settings to share with specific people! I would love to see a common map with colors where you can see all the places you‚Äôve been. 
Also a wishlist would be a great addition and merging moments to days, so it would look a bit more organized. 

Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è | I really love this app and the ability to share photos with friends & family! But this is 2023- we should be able to share videos as well!! I have several I would like to upload and it‚Äôs not even available in the paid version? I‚Äôm really surprised! Unless I overlooked it.. please help me find it or add it to the features!! | I cannot recommend Journi. Here's the list of negatives after a week of use:

A. No one you invite can follow your travels/see your entries without registering (i.e., giving out their email).
B. There is no web-based way to enter photos or text, only on the phone app. I asked, and they told me so.
C. There is a 1000-character limit to any blog entry you may want to create. That's longer than a Tweet, but insufficient to cover an intricate topic.
D. There is no option for individual captions for photos.
E. Photos of the same general location (in my case, Vienna's Zentralfriedhof) were separated as different entries when I happened to wander 50 yards from where your first photos were taken....even though I uploaded all those photos simultaneously. There is no identifiable mechanism for reuniting those photos into a single entry.
F. AND YET, a photo taken from a plane over the Alps helped to misidentify the location of 6 other photos taken in Vienna. In other words, figuring out the app's use of location data is inconsistent & nightmarish.
G. The premium membership is comparatively expensive, and the payoff is not worth a tiny percentage of the price.

In short, this app is better marketed than it is constructed. Skip it, and try something that is more flexible and whose business model does not involve scarfing up data from your friends and family. | There are so many ways this could be easier. It is frustrating importing pictures when adding to a previous event, arranging photos would be much easier if it was drag and drop, it doesn‚Äôt work with Apple Pencil, there are a little glitches when typing or selecting photos when editing previous events. It feels like it was built around ordering photo books and not journaling.  

TIP: organize everything in advance including your photos, what order you want them in and what you want to write. Going back to edit is clunky. | I‚Äôm looking for an app that will allow me to document my vacation with both photos and narrative. This may be the best I‚Äôve found but I‚Äôm having trouble figuring it all out. 
Is there any documentation show how best to utilize all it‚Äôs features? | Great app!
Waiting for the option to upload videos, and to have custom categories. | Great way to ‚Äútravel along‚Äù with  the actual travelers. | I‚Äôve made about 20+ books through Journi and I‚Äôve been highly satisfied each time. The books are very high quality. Making the books id easy & the App continues to get better each time I use it (more options etc). Finalizing your book & payment/checking out is a breeze too. I highly recommend!!! | I canNOT find my friend‚Äôs journey! | I usually don‚Äôt write reviews, but this app was constantly sending push notifications insisting me to purchase a subscription. Hate it, bad app, this should be forbidden. | Great way too share memories | Went on a family trip and the whole family contributed to the trip journal! Was able to get it printed later. Easy and really useful tool for recording memories | You had one job!

Simply terrible at fetching photos, no matter what source you pick ‚Äî phone, Google, Facebook. It just spins and spins, and never shows any photos.

And when the albums finally do show up ‚Äî like they did by the time I was finished posting this review ‚Äî they are in only in a semi-logical order, even after the latest update. They certainly don‚Äôt follow the order of the platform you are getting them from.

Example: photos from the native iPhone photo app are MOSTLY in reverse date order, with the newest photos at the very bottom of the list. As a profession photographer with over 130,000 photos, this takes a LONG time to scroll down to the most current photos. Not all of the albums in my photo library show up (or at least not in the order created).

When I do open an album it takes FOREVER to show even a single photo ‚Äî on high speed cable internet! I can watch a whole TV episode without one photo showing up. | I love this app very accurate on mapping ur photos love ur app easy to use | I am able to record my memories and it is easy to use. | Love the automatic and clean design layouts. When will the larger size books be available for the US market? I was so excited to see the 11.5‚Äùx11.5‚Äù listed in the print shop several weeks ago, but when I went to create a book today, it is no longer listed. I hope this can be made available soon. As much as I love the simplicity of Journi books, the larger size is worth the extra effort in the other apps. I am also a premium member and the app would not let me add a caption while I was on WiFi saying I was offline. I thought you should be able to work offline with the premium membership. Please bring the larger sizes to the US! | Really loved this for our family road trip.  So easy to post and show others where all we went.  I liked the map feature as well.  Best part was that when I got home, I basically spent 5 minutes to have a photo book made. It came in about 5 days and was gorgeous.  Will definitely use this app again.  Only downside was the book was a bit pricey but for the convenience I feel it was worth it. | When friends and family try to enjoy my blog in a browser on their computer the text overlaps my pictures resulting in an unreadable story and a very bad representation of my beautiful images. It's an experience that's beyond horrible. The developer apparently does not care or does not know how to fix this. Heck, a free Tumblr or Wordpress.com account do a better job in sharing my trips with grand parents and teenagers. Please don't just focus on your app but look at the overall platform which you want to build. | We use this to share our travel journey with loved ones without posting too many pics on social media. | Pictures are clear; showing detail and adding some commentary make the Journi even more enjoyable . | We traveled the country for 9 months and I really wanted a journal app I could print. After quite a bit of searching I ran across Journi. I recently printed our book and I am soooo pleased with it. The quality is top notch, we got it in just a few weeks, and it‚Äôs a book full of memories. Will definitely use the journi app for our yearly scrap books. So much easier. ‚ù§Ô∏è | Planned a 30 day family road trip and wanted an app that would allow me to keep a log of my memories through both words and photos. While very new to Journi I did find some hiccups. We are limited to 10 photos per memory if we could up that to 12-16 that would have been nice not to have to eliminate photos I really wanted to include. Their is no interface with instagram? Not sure why they‚Äôre no capabilities with Instagram? Sharing memories on Instagram would be amazing? Nice to add stamps of the different states of the US instead of just a US stamp. We road tripped through 7 states and it would have been nice to stamp them. 
Loved the ability to creat a book at the end of the trip and to have the ability to edit photos placement with my iPhone was the best compared to all other photo book apps. Thank you for the easy to use photo book app | The reason I live Journi so much is because all of my friends and family can follow me on my trip. And because of the format, it makes them feel as if they were there with me. 
But the best part is that I can create a book about it at the end!! | I found Journi online after moving to Spain about 18 months ago. I knew I would be siteseeing in Europe quite often and wanted to keep a diary of my travels. I find the app excellent for setting up individual trips and it automatically dates and maps the photos. At the end of 2019 I decided I wanted to create a book of my adventures. The app was easy to use and quite efficient. While there are a few things regarding editing I would love to see but really that would possibly take away from the simplicity of the app. Once I set up the book, I was concerned about price and quality. My book was 180‚Ç¨ but when I checked other apps and resources, that was a fair price for 190 page hardcover book. I have a friend I referred the app and he is now sharing his trips with friends. He just ordered a book as well. The quality of the book is great. You can‚Äôt beat Journi. | I share my trip diary and photos with family and friends. They love it. Then once home I do a photo book. I love that it includes my diary. I have 8 now.  From all over the world. | Great app for quick and easy travel journaling. Allows collaboration between different travelers and makes it easy to share with friends and family. Please add video option soon!!!! | First, there is virtually nothing to get you started. Many apps when you run the first time will give you a quick overview. Not Journi. You are left to poke around and hope you figure it out. There is NO IN-APP HELP. The you tube channel has videos, however there is no sound and they chose to record them at a pace that is only helpful if you already know how to use the app. The app would greatly benefit from a brief introduction. For example, when you creat a new Journi it starts you off with a map. I spent 5 minutes trying to get the map to show the correct location. It turns out the app will do this automatically which is nice, but there is no way to know that in advance.

Second, and this is the most limiting in my opinion. There are no photo captions. So, if you add a stop in France and add what Journi calls a ‚Äúmoment‚Äù, you can give the moment a title and description, but if you upload 10 pics, it will just show the grouping of pics with no way to indicate what each pic is. Since the main reason to do a trip journal is to preserve the memories of the trip, I don‚Äôt know why there isn‚Äôt a way to note what the pics are of. Some pics are obvious. But others are not. For example I added pics of specific things during a visit to the Louvre. I have no way to add a description of what the pics are and why I chose those pics out of the hundreds I could have chosen. This one thing will likely lead me to choose another app. FYI I opted for the premium service and it also does not allow for photo captions. | Journi is an app that allows you to create awesome photo books of a recent trip, special event or family vacation. The quality of the photo books is excellent. And the app is easy to use. It allows you to write a description of each photo and select the photos for each page. I am most impressed by the quality of the photos and the arrangement of the books. I have used Journi to make several photo books.  I highly recommend them especially if you are looking for an awesome high quality photo book to capture special memories. Additionally, they are easy to work with and quick turnaround to receive your completed photo book. I encourage everyone to order a photo book or other items from Journi. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Kathy USA | Love to create blogs to connect with family and friends while traveling. Makes a record for us to remember our trips! | Great way to share your travels with family and friends! | You can‚Äôt delete items. | I‚Äôm really having a hard time trying to create past Journals. Every time I attempt to upload photos to a new Journi event from iPhoto‚Äôs, it freezes or it just continuously searches forever wher I just give up. 

Also, I wish their was a search feature for a specific key word or date when looking for past trips to upload. 

Right now I‚Äôm giving this app a 3 star review due to the issue of uploading photos to create a Journi event. | Journi app is amazing. I rarely recommend things, but some are very worthy!  We recently took a trip to Israel. I wanted an app to blog our trip, allow others to follow us daily and align photos with events effortlessly. (I just knew I would not take time later to do it.) This app hit the spot.  And it was 100% accomplished from my phone. I took pics with a WiFi enabled camera and uploaded them at the end of everyday. Our family and friends could follow our trip.  Journi also has the ability to print a book.... with photos and comments all ready organized. So easy. I received the book today. It was made well and exceeded my expectations.  If you are taking any kind of trip I very highly recommend Journi. | Perfectly laid out. Liked watching the arrow move from one day to the next and how pictures and descriptions are there. | Great app. Switched from polar steps for my Japan trip when deciding to use both at the same time to see which one worked faster and more convenient. If anyone is listening please add a feature that allows current selected pictures to be shown for a moment when editing or adding so you won‚Äôt accidentally select them twice. | I was living abroad for a year and used Journi as a blog to update my family and then to turn into a photo book at the end. Because I had posted for an entire year it was a little expensive to get the book.

When you want to access flight details you really need you have to scroll endlessly. | Used to be my favorite app for travel things. Now just deleted it. First never finds flight info under booking number anymore, and now every time you open app you need to type in your email and get a code which is stupid if you can set up Face ID Touch ID or whatever but not that stupid way. Disappointed and deleted it. | I attempted to give this app a try. I should have read the reviews first. There is limited synch with this app. This app does NOT Work. Pass it by. There is NO tutorial or how to use guide. You are guessing at this. | This app used to be great, giving you updates on your flight in the airport. Now it doesn‚Äôt even register an itinerary!
Looking at the positive reviews, they are from 5-6 years ago, now this app has become useless! | I‚Äôve been using the KAYAK app and wanted to try this one out. However, unlike KAYAK, which seems to ingest confirmation emails that are forwarded to it quite flawlessly, this app does not. Therefore, it makes things more difficult. Otherwise it has a slick interface. | The app was merely spammy and full of ads in the past; after the ‚Äòupdate‚Äô it is deprived of features, full of bugs, and still spammy. Doesn‚Äôt show anything when offline at foreign airports. That‚Äôs when you need the app the most. Trips can‚Äôt get deleted in the app once added through the chat bot! I‚Äôve cancelled flights and can‚Äôt remove them. When opening the app and swiping through flights, the app jumps to the first flight in the list randomly. Ridiculous programming. Trips can‚Äôt be added to calendar any longer. Trips don‚Äôt get update when the date for a booking number has changed (changed flight with airline) Today I received five times the same spam notification urging me to book a lounge through the app or their website. This app has become utterly useless, frustrating, and annoying (notification spam). Avoid! | Super annoying SLOW Assistant based interface - just give us a basic interface with fields to enter! | I cannot count the time wasted with your app. It is not helpful at all. I have tried every reference number to add my flights. I have tried to manually add and it has only added half my trip. This app is not helpful whatsoever. I sound not have had to work so hard to get my trips added. 
Makes me so frustrated | Don‚Äôt waste your time.  This used to be the best for my travels.  It has saved me from missing an overseas flight twice when the airline delay would make me miss the connecting flight to Germany. Since the last updates it is almost useless.  All the information that was so helpful is gone. So disappointing.  I would have paid to keep the previous version.  Deleted from my phone.  Looking for a replacement. | How could they screw this up so badly. This app now has been rendered useless. Can‚Äôt check on any detail about your flight, only simple things like flight numbers and time. THAT‚ÄôS IT!!! You can‚Äôt even see your seat and frequent flyer info. And if you have other people on the same booking? Just forget about it, you can‚Äôt check on anything whatsoever. What a f up update. Pointless indeed. | This app is just a scam to withhold your flight confirmation number. I‚Äôve learned my lesson. | It used to sync trip details with the calendar, not anymore | Used to be the best traveling app‚Ä¶ not it‚Äôs just an overly complicated chatbot under a wanna-be AI disguise that simply does not work. | I used to love this app and would use it to morganite every single trip and introduced it to several friends. Then they upgraded and it became completely useless. I wonder if the developers don‚Äôt see that usage has dropped. It would be better for them to revert to the former version honestly. This new version is just awful.  I have moved on to other travel apps. | It is clearly on the airlines flight schedule for that day. I sent in request for fixing it and they said working on it. Still nothing done or working. I deleted it as we are leaving in three weeks. | This app was a very good travel app but it has lost it‚Äôs way. Recently had to load booking code (6alpha numeric) to get flight information. This was OK. BUT when it provided ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù tap the app asked for the booking code. Why? No memory. App knows airlines but if you have already check-in the app can‚Äôt cross check with airlines.  I find it‚Äôs best to use the airline app and merely use this app (if at all) as a quick reference tool | I tried adding my trip manually several times and it kept giving me wrong flight info, and there is no way to update just one flight of a multi-flight itinerary, which is very frustrating.

I then emailed my itinerary as the other option suggested. When it came back it was still incorrect. 

Not worth my effort, deleted won‚Äôt try again. | Over the course of five days, I tried to add a trip using all three of the methods suggested.  I tried to manually add my trip at least 10 times all to no avail.  While this app used to be quite seamless, it now doesn‚Äôt seem to work and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anyone you can talk to.  The ‚Äúassistant‚Äù doesn‚Äôt connect you to a live person.  I‚Äôm ready to dump this app. | Something changed with this app and it‚Äôs totally nonfunctional, frozen screen, lost decades of travel data and absolutely zero customer service. | I used this app before, but suddenly it stopped working. Try to add trip and it send you to digital assistant and it goes nowhere | This was a good app a few years ago and extremely useful for a frequent traveler.  It would quickly identify your flights based on your ticket code and provide accurate, timely updates if flights were delayed etc.  Not now - since an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù (which apparently brought in ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù‚Ä¶) it rarely finds my flights from the reservation code and most times now you have to enter data manually, even when traveling on major airlines. The update facility has either disappeared or just doesn‚Äôt work anymore - I am sat in a plane which was announced to be delayed 6 hours ago and CheckMyTrip still hasn‚Äôt picked up on it.  It is now a complete waste of time.  I used to use this app all the time and rely on it for frequent travel.  Sadly it is going downhill rapidly‚Ä¶ | I heard about this app on a trusted travel forum.  I really just doesn‚Äôt work.  Can find my flights using confirmation code, cant find my reservation using flight/date combination.

Not worth the time I spent.  Deleted the app on Day 1 | Used to be a useful website and app, now totally useless. Fails to import bookings and relies on a stupid chat agent for doing anything. Just chasing the AI bandwagon by adding a dumb chat bot for basic functionality. Deleting my account and the app. | I‚Äôve been trying for 20 minutes to login for the first time. It keeps sending a code to my email and when I paste and add it into the app, it says it is an invalid code. Does anybody know if a better app to keep track of my travel itinerary? | We used to enter the booking reference but now it asks to enter each flight number and date ‚Ä¶ bit of a pain on a long trip with many flights and days | Doesn‚Äôt add trips either via forwarded email or manually.  No support.  Message app reply to request says basically that they are busy with other requests.  It‚Äôs worth the cost-i.e. nothing.  I use TripIt for all my travel ‚Äîgreat app and well worth paying for. | It takes forever trying to search your trip if its on a different email. They have ruined the app. Nobody wants to sit and chat with a bot and enter all flight details manually. Not a great idea. Should go back to the way it was. | So extra for no reason, AI used in app is trash I hope to god I never have to use it again | If you can‚Äôt access your email that you originally set up the account with you can never sign back in because the app will only send a code to the defunct email account. Its as dunb as it sounds. | It needs a way to correct a flight without deleting the entire trip. Flight from ORD-YVR comes up as Omaha to Chicago | This stupid AI app ever. Doesn‚Äôt work whata junk | Used to be comprehensive and good. Now, pathetic | Do not waste your time with this app | It working very well, why u change and remove everything, what is the point now from your current up?!!! | The new version is awful, fully stripped down of features and providing as little information as possible. New trips are difficult to add, they disappear after adding, while deleted trips reappear. The assistant is unhelpful. Amadeus is well equipped to provide a good product and this is clearly an act of self destruction. | The app used to be good without the digital assistant. From the reviews that I‚Äôve read, it looks like the developers aren‚Äôt looking to fix the app. Welp‚Ä¶.time to switch apps. | It was sooo much easier to use without the bot. Even after adding details, can‚Äôt see trip. Scrap the bit feature | The latest version of this app it is a huge mistake. 
I‚Äôve used CheckMyTrip for at least 20 years, even when it was just a webpage and not an app and with the new upgrade I cannot use it any longer. 
I used to store all my business and personal trip information using booking reference and my name info but now the only way to automatically import trip information with the booking reference is if you have personally booked the trip with your email address which it is not the normal practice in the business world. 
I hope that future versions will incorporate back the option to import bookings with the traveler info. | The update that requires use of a cumbersome chat bot for any inputs was a bad choice by the app developers.  It involves what should be in unnecessary inputs and is not initially intuitive. Please bring back the option to enter the old way.  Will not use this app, which I liked using before this change, until this requirement is removed and at worst the chat bit is an option. | We‚Äôve used this app in the past and it was awesome. From the last time we‚Äôve used it it has gone off a cliff horrible | This was a great APP prior to the latest update which crashed all of the data and no longer accepts confirmation numbers when you use a travel agent.  Sent in more than 5 requests to their customer support with no response.  I‚Äôve deleted the APP and made note of the developer to avoid any future APPs created by them. | New version is quite useless and not user-friendly. Unable to add trip easily like the old versions. I will probably not use this anymore and have to rely on each airline‚Äôs mobile app instead for each trip. | This had been a fine app.  In March, however, they rolled out a purported ‚Äúupdate‚Äù that simply does not work in any respect.  It‚Äôs not only useless, but it‚Äôs a negative ‚Äî you undertake actions to add flights to the app, only to find that there‚Äôs nothing there.  I cannot understand why they ever rolled out the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù or why, upon realizing that it was a complete bust, they didn‚Äôt go back to the old, functional app.  Unreal.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD IN ITS CURRENT STATE. | Was working great, a favorite app. Latest update requires a fresh log in and now my trip is lost and the Amadeus booking code is ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù Not happy. | The recent update destroyed the app. I used to really like this app prior to the recent update and probably would‚Äôve rated it as 4 or 5 stars for that version. However, since the most recent update the app is now a shell of its former self. It is clunky and hard to use, and 95% of the information it used to provide is gone. 
Don‚Äôt waste your time with this app so long as this is the version is in operation because it is useless in this form. | This app is practically worthless. Trying to add a trip in the app? Don‚Äôt bother. You won‚Äôt be able to unless you forward your confirmation email to the developer. This app is a horrible waste of time.

Update: I forwarded my trip confirmation email, received a reply email stating it was added, and it still doesn‚Äôt populate in the app. This app isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpractically‚Äù worthless‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs COMPLETELY worthless. | Last update makes you go into a chat with a virtual admin assistance and you cannot see your trips anymore. Big mistake, everyone I know is going to another app. | Latest update seems to have broke the app. I keep getting dummy notifications and emails for random trips that are not mine. | Won‚Äôt load my SW flights.

I put in all my trips and it shows the pattern and rolls up all the statistics in a nice clean dashboard. It really is a marvel to behold. Best app I‚Äôve come across in quite some time. | Let me drag and drop steps wherever I want, make the location search better by allowing actual addresses. And I can‚Äôt seem to change whether a distance is set to a flight or driving. Do better! | Useless app just collecting all the pictures from your gallery and pretending it to be a trip. Not user friendly at all | It so easy to journal your trip and keep all the love ones up to date. | I love the app but the UX is kinda not good for example I can‚Äôt search for a specific location in the guide section  i have to go back and forth google maps to see where it is located on the map , also in the search bar it says search people & place when it shows up it turns to trip , this is UX disaster. Overall make locations searchable | So fun to follow friends on their two-year adventure from Oregon to Antarctica and back - in their custom van! | Recently downloaded the app and was really happy with how it tracked my trip to remote areas in Antarctica.  However, as a whole, this app is frustrating and disappointing to me as a lifetime traveler.  To see it reflecting the sum total of my travels as 2% of the world is not only inaccurate but insulting.  The app should add a means to record lifetime travel or its usefulness is only in the moment during travel or as a means to look back only at recent travel.  

Adding a checklist of countries, cities or the like to capture a user‚Äôs full travel history would make it a more fulfilling experience as a user.  I do like how it uses location data from photos in the phone, that too is limited to relatively recent history. | Great app for allowing new puppy owners to track the travels of their new puppy in real time! | This app is simply brilliant! It‚Äôs a real journal of your travels, step by step. | I love this app. It‚Äôs so fun to see my journey develop over 4 years of travel and beyond | Since joining it has kept me current with my brother‚Äôs journey | I always enjoy traveling yet keeping up on these travels can be a bit challenging.  With Polorsteps, I can revisit my specific trip, exact places, comments and photos.  Additionally, I appreciate the ability to track all travel experiences across the globe.  Highly recommend | This is the number 1 app for travel. I can used for free, #1 #1. | I love polar steps and use it to keep a personal record of my overseas and at home travels. It‚Äôs easy to use and I really like the map feature. Highly recommend. | I absolutely love this app, I have been using it to track my travels for years now and it‚Äôs my favorite! It is so cool to go back and look at the maps it makes! | I absolutely love this app.  I have been tracking my trips - I don‚Äôt forget things and my friends can see my adventures! | I have been using polarsteps for about 7 weeks now to track my travels. I loved it at first and had no issues, however in the last few weeks I CONSTANTLY have issues uploading videos. I've tried uploading videos on wifi & data, it still comes up with an error though. Not sure I'll continue using it if this bug persits. | I use Polarsteps for all my travels - it's not just great to share your trip with friends and families, but also to keep your trip documented for later. It's an amazing memory and I love going back to past trips and see what we've been doing. But most importantly, the photobook which you can create is absolutely fantastic. The quality and the design are just perfect. I've ordered about 5 photobooks already and love them all! It is so easy and fast to create that you actually do it. Would 100% recommend!! | I‚Äôve been traveling for a month and found out about this from a fellow traveler. It‚Äôs brilliant in concept but I cannot get it to track my current trip. It synced all of my trips from 7 years ago from my photos with all gps location details, and attached photos to those locations. But the point of me using it is for my current trip and it is just a blank slat. Does not import my photos, location, or dates at all. I‚Äôve done everything I can think of, went into a deep dive in my iOS settings, went through the trip settings, my account settings, read through pretty much the ENTIRE help center, scoured Reddit, updated my phone, deleted my account and reinstalled it, restarted my phone etc and NOTHING WORKS!! It wants me to add everything manually down to the date I flew and the location I flew into and then the next place I stayed etc but at no point does it ever finally pick up in syncing to fill the info in. I ended the trips, restarted the trip, every thing I can possibly think of and NOTHING works. What is the point in using this for your friends and family to track your travels if it only syncs trip details after you arrive back home?!?! The only trips it syncs are ones where I‚Äôve ended AND flown back to my home location. Otherwise this stupid thing is WORTHLESS and you might as well just post on social media because it will be endlessly less frustrating!!! | I documented a month long trip through Scotland after I returned home and the result was impressive. It would have been even better had I known about and used the app during the trip. The browser interface for sharing & viewing the trip works well; navigation would be aided if trip steps could be collapsed to a single line showing just the step name. A native iPad UI for the app would also be great as would a built-in airplay option. I could go on with feature requests but for a free app with no advertising Polarsteps shines as is. | we be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. | I have been using Polarsteps since its Beta phase and I love it. I like that my trip posts can be private or public. The app is easy to use. The book editing can be a little time consuming but the final product is of first rate quality. | Polarsteps is awesome!   I have used both the app & website versions for years and can‚Äôt say enough good things about them.  It just keeps getting better all the time.  

The team behind PolarSteps is committed to providing a seamless experience for everyone.  I recently encountered an issue, contacted them, and the problem was corrected quickly & perfectly.  

If you are considering PolarSteps, don‚Äôt hesitate to try it‚Ä¶..you won‚Äôt be disappointed! | Absolutely the best travel tracker app I‚Äôve found. Best way to save all of the memories from your journeys and even convert them into a high quality photo book. | I have three trips that were taken years ago that still show I am traveling. I have tried numerous times to go in and change the end date. I have deleted the app. I am only working on my iPhone. I can‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt get it to end the trip. | Amazing app if you‚Äôre into traveling really easy to use. | We are | Great app which is intuitive, easy and highly functional, however the photo book process and options needs work‚Ä¶merger with Shutterfly or Mixbook(?) | I love this app and the concept of documenting your travel. I also love the idea of being able to make a book at the end. But the app is insanely glitchy!!! There have been several instances where I added all my photos and wrote out paragraphs of text, just for Polarsteps to delete parts of it after posting. For example, I just wrote out many paragraphs detailing a day of my trip, and polar steps deleted everything but the first couple sentences. There is no archive and no way of retrieving the lost text. Another time, I uploaded many photos and the app only actually uploaded one. I had to delete the step entirely and try again. 
Love this concept, PLEASE fix this app!!!!!! | I learned about Polarsteps from a fellow American I just happened to meet in Izmir, Turkey, and he told me he was using the app as his  travel blog, so I downloaded it and followed him. Actually, now that I think about it, I started using it that same day in 2018! And I never stopped. How do I remember such details? Because my experience is forever recorded in the app, complete with pictures, maps, and real time experiences. Polarsteps is so easy and intuitive, I have used it for every trip i‚Äôve taken since then. At least 20-30 trips, many them abroad. It is so fun to go back through my past adventures and relive the details. Travel is something so special to me, and I want to remember everything I did, as well as keep my friends and family informed in real time. Polarsteps helps me so that. I highly recommend it. | I gotta tell you, PolarSteps is the bomb-diggity of travel apps! üåç‚úàÔ∏è Seriously, it‚Äôs like having your personal travel guru right in your pocket. I‚Äôve been on the app since the beginning and I‚Äôve happily carried PolarSteps around the globe with me.

One thing that totally rocks about PolarSteps is their overall travel statistics. It‚Äôs like looking at your own travel r√©sum√© - you can see how many countries you‚Äôve conquered, how many miles you‚Äôve trekked, and even the time you‚Äôve spent in transit (Jetsetter badge, anyone?). It‚Äôs perfect for impressing your friends with your travel street cred.

But wait, there‚Äôs more! The interactive global map is where the real magic happens. You can zoom in on the exact spots you‚Äôve been, and it‚Äôs like reliving your adventures all over again. It‚Äôs like having a digital scrapbook that you can share with your peeps, complete with photos and notes.

Plus, the app is super user-friendly. You don‚Äôt have to be a tech whiz to navigate it. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned globetrotter or just planning your first big trip, PolarSteps has got you covered. It‚Äôs the ultimate travel sidekick, and it‚Äôs all about making your journeys cooler than a polar bear‚Äôs toenails. üêß‚ùÑÔ∏è

So, if you‚Äôre into tracking your adventures and reliving the good times, PolarSteps is the way to go. It‚Äôs the app that turns your travels into epic stories. Happy adventuring, my fellow wanderlusters! üåüüåèüåü | Love this App! Wonderful to make a book of your trip! They do an awesome job making your book! | There is a bug where I cannot follow the trips that have been shared with me. When I click a friend‚Äôs link, it takes me to the app homepage. Even when I search for that person, it says they have no trips. It works fine on the web version so it must be an app issue. No way to contact support either. | Nice to see friends on their trips | Splendid app to track friends from all over the world as they travel! | I‚Äôd like to start off by saying that I absolutely love the step tracking features in this app. It‚Äôs like the perfect digital journal for my trips. There are just a few features that irk me when trying to use the newer features. I don‚Äôt understand why, if you can load predicted routes using roam to rio, we can‚Äôt just use the predicted route as an actual one in step tracking. I hate having to use the steps suggested when tracking is on, but the straight lines look sooo bad in the finished trip map. Why can‚Äôt I just say, ‚Äúyes I took the exact route suggested by roam to rio, use that for the map‚Äù? The tracked steps are always random and sometimes skip major sections so it doesn‚Äôt follow our route.

 And I want to buy one of the travel books so badly because I spent so much time documenting my trip in this app that there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm creating a book in another one, but the features to edit the layout are extremely limited. Only getting to fit 4 photos on a page with a 400 page limit is so hard! If I have a long trip or I want a more photos I‚Äôm unable to fit everything I want to show. I took a 2 month trip and was so excited to print the book only to realize that I‚Äôd have to pick like 4 photos for each step and they don‚Äôt fit onto the page very efficiently. I would gladly drop the $200 for a large travel book if I could actually control the page layouts.

Finally, is there any plan to incorporate the 3D globe that androids have for the iPhone app. I love being able to look at all the steps on the globe on my friends phones but it‚Äôs just a flat, non-interactive map on the iPhone. Again, I love the app and I use it all the time, I just wish it had a few more features to make documentation easier. | This is a wonderful app because it allows us as travelers to keep our family and friends abreast of our travels. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre being there with us I would highly recommend it. | My family and I followed my daughter and her friends on PolarSteps as they traveled through Europe after college graduation. The graduates loved posting multiple photos on PolarSteps and journaling about their journey. They also felt more comfortable posting multiple photos on PolarSteps than on Instagram. | What a great way to record a trip. I tend to take a lot of pictures and I appreciate that I am not limited in what I post, nor am I limited in how much I choose to write. Unfortunately I cannot provide captions for specific pictures. 
Combining a live map of where we are at any specific time is fantastic.
I hope I can make their work worthwhile with picture books ordered after the trip. Great business model idea - I hope it pans out! | I have been using Polar Steps for more than 5 years and my Italy Trip on the app was ruined. The location services are always active and there has been internet access during the whole trip but my steps were not recorded. So basically day one and day 8, no exact routes or anything.

Thanks for that. | Whenever my friend goes on a trip I have the worst time signing in to follow. Get stuck in loop of new password not recognized. | been loving this app. makes keeping my friends and family so easy and fun. I do wish there was a feature where i could turn off the live location without going private or followers only just for safety reasons. | This app is something I have imagined before and wished existed. With a few UI thibgs and some other flow improvements this app could be near perfect in what it does and delivers. 

My only wish is that users were more in control of the privacy settings, and that there were more ways you could manage the way the data is stored and used. | The application give me the feeling to travel from my house in the USA with my family in Europe.  I can follow them through the countries and beautiful photos they take. Thank you | Love keeping up with my granddaughterüôÉ | We just came back from a one month trip. We used Polarsteps and shared with our friends. They all said it‚Äôs fantastic. They read every what we wrote at every stop and the pictures we posted from different places. It‚Äôs a good thing to remain for us as a fond memory and a travel log. We may review those pleasant experiences at any time. Will recommend all my friends to try it. | Great App. Communication with the teachers and pictures of places they were visiting was Fantastic.üèÜ
Thank you very much!!!
The Dittrich Family | I have used this app for a number of trips and love it! I recommend to all my friends traveling. We have also ordered the travel books the app created.

Thank you for adding that Sam‚Äôs! | Yes I had an issue with a sale price not scanning properly and Justin at the service desk in Paducah was very helpful in resolving the issue. I was very impressed with his polite and friendly attitude. | The cottonwood store won‚Äôt stock my favorite coffee, Yuban. Why not??
Also still long lines, even with two people scanning receipts at the exit doors. Can you do something about that? | I have never chosen to do an online order before today.  My ability to come to the store to shop for some of the pool items is now limited due to physical inabilities.  It went quite well.

Also, I love the fact that I can use there gas station there with great prices. | You advertise the option of free delivery for laminate flooring, but you will only deliver a few at a time. In order to have 80 boxes delivered I would have to break up my order into about 10 or 11 orders or pay over $500 for shipping with plus membership. Not worth the hassle.

Heavy duty great value | Love Sam‚Äôs club | Muy pr√°ctico para las compras | I love Sams club! We are a bigger family, with kids in school, club activities, sports, church events, we have 2 under 2 that need diapers wipes formula etc so shopping at Sam‚Äôs club is not only a big money saver for us, but it is very convenient too! Easy to use app, and at this location a lot of stuff is always available! | Really like the organization and ease in shopping at Longview Sams Club! | I appreciate the work going into keeping the Club clean and tidy. Noticed and like the fresh paint job. 

More of the staff is eager to help !! | This app is extremely easy to use and makes shopping beyond better!! | Every time I go into this location, I have a great experience. I find clothes that are great prices and the employees are always friendly! Thank you for making my shopping experience nice. | Best thing ever!!! I'm in and out usually in no time!!! I hate lines and I'm happy to see SAMS differentiating to individual shoppers and their experience!

I‚Äôm not understanding where the logic in this nor why is this even a thing in 2024. Please fix or add the option for dual emails on the same account to be able to share information including pick ups. | Good service | So convenient to have the items you need (and forgot to pick up while in the store) shipped right to our door. | Scan and go makes it so easy to get in and out of the store even during busy shopping times. Goodbye long lines on a weekend when it‚Äôs the only time I can get to the store! | This App is Amazing! You won‚Äôt have to wait in line to check out ever again!

This is my go-to for the best deals. Great rates on premium rooms with premium accommodations. Just make sure to check all your options available and scroll through each option along side its description of what accommodations include. As you think prices only get higher going down, sometimes you find the best offering of room+accommodations 1/10th the price. Definitely recommend!! | Love it! | Thanks I‚Äôm excited | Really helpful | You can gain access to hotels others can‚Äôt . Love the No cancellation fees as some times we just can‚Äôt get on a flight!

My only suggestion is to be able to modify my trip to find another flight even after check-in in case I do not make the flight because of space unavailable, for exemple there are 1 to many non rev on that flight, then I lose the booking instead I could proceed with the same booking on another flight! | Is great | Easy to use.

The help gave me scenarios no real way to get help. If you need complications in your life this app will help. | Takes forever to log in this app is trash | This most recent set of updates have completely destroyed the usability. It no longer even seems to communicate with the server, continually giving the error message ""we could not load the most recent report data. please pull to refresh,"" which, of course, does nothing. It will not allow images of receipts to be uploaded, again, repeatedly generating an error message. I would give this app zero stars if I could. | Takes forever to load receipts and expenses | Used to love this app. Been using it since 2014 and always found it fast and convenient. I don‚Äôt know why they changed to this new style. Everything takes longer. Expense reports won‚Äôt load. My expense report takes 3X as long now. It is a buggy mess now. | Concur used to be the best software I used.  It has in the last few years been improved to the point it is the worst user experience of any software I touch. This is horrible people. | Concur used to be a good app. It is now painfully slow and almost usable. Forget entering your expenses as you pay them (which was easy 10 years ago) unless you want your party to sit around for 10 minutes after dinner while you wait for Concur to load. The AI is implementation is terrible. The suggestions are always comically wrong. Hint to SAP, the first line of a receipt is never the total (it‚Äôs usually at the bottom). Clearly ther engineers didn‚Äôt train the AI or test the app. | I like it | Takes to long to open | Since the last update, the app won‚Äôt let me log into my concur‚Ä¶ but on my computer on a web browser, I can log in just fine. | Concur made a lot of things simpler - especially after working in Asia where paper receipts and excels dominated, but the app, which is very ok with generally useable functionality seems to have gotten worse. It used to be that my favourite feature would be to open the app, snap a receipt in seconds and have the basics recorded. Now it takes ages to load and even longer to take a picture and confirming the amount has become less intuitive. When I‚Äôm on a trip and recording dozens of receipts a week, I reckon this delay is costing me the equivalent of a full working day a year (compared to the previous versions). | This app makes life totally easier. With a snap of a picture, all my expenses are saved! Thanks SAP Concur for making my life so much easier!! | Scanning an Uber receipt? It shows up as a meal. The invoice says ‚ÄúPhoenix, Arizona‚Äù? Well glad the tool choose Hong Kong Dollar as the right currency‚Ä¶ honestly, the tool makes the most stupid mistakes and wrong scans.. it takes me forever to correct‚Ä¶ a other example? You correct the hotel itemization‚Ä¶ and just to mess with you the tool updates also the date of the entry‚Ä¶ 6 months back‚Ä¶ just because‚Ä¶ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to the change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and also grant me the patience to change the things again that I already changed once but the server failed to save.

‚Ä¶and also the wisdom to stop asking when the UI and function of Concur will feel like it crossed over Y2K. | The most godawful app in existence. Common bugs are never fixed. | If the new update from a few months ago was to make this app as inconvenient as possible, then it has been a success. | ÊúâÊó∂‰ºöÊ≠ªÊéâÔºåÂÖ∂ÂÆÉÈÉΩËøòÂ•Ω | Generally, this app is very good and works well to create and approve expense reports. An obvious feature that is missing is the ability to match/combine duplicate entries. I create expense entries with receipt's immediately, but the corresponding credit card charge is days later. The iOS app rarely matches these and the web app must be used. | PLEASE FIX. Buttons don‚Äôt load. App crashes. | A great way to expense stuff on the go, but I swear they‚Äôve never debugged this app once in it‚Äôs lifetime. Most of the time it takes multiple tries to get it to load, and sometimes it never works at all. Too frustrating to be worth it, would rather just do it on the computer and save the time | App is bugged. Keyboard will not pop up to allow typing, also cannot start new report, only see submitted reports. | Not working | It seems like every few months the app crashes, won‚Äôt allow receipt uploads, doesn‚Äôt work well across iPhone photos (doesn‚Äôt want to upload from photos to the app), losing reports, uploaded receipts after crashes causing double work. Frustrating, hope our company moves to a different platform. | Used to be easy. New update and this app is as fast as a snail. Brutal | The app is a nice idea, but it takes 10-20seconds for it to process each step (and there are 4 steps to enter each individual receipt). Needs to be quicker!!! It shouldn‚Äôt take more than 5 seconds to completely enter an expense and assign it to an expense report.

Glitchy and stalls a lot! 

This is not a good app! | But the app is garbage. Even after recently updating I can‚Äôt add images of receipts. It‚Äôs buggy and slow. All the time. It‚Äôs literally like 5 actions that need to be completed and this trash app can‚Äôt even do that. | Is exhausting. Why does it not work?  It did before you updated it. I still spend my life on authenticating and loading. It never loads and I restart a good five times and may work | Doesn‚Äôt load sometimes and I have to close it | Glitchy. Temperamental. | Why is the camera feature so difficult to use? It takes forever for the entire receipt to get in the frame or needs to be edited afterwards 

Impossible to use for anyone other then yourself; ie making arrangements or expenses for others. | It seems to me that those writing this program do not have to use it.  The last several updates have made the program so unfriendly to the end user. 
You guys can do better. | This is very frustrating. Concur app used to be pretty good and got the job done. Now there‚Äôs loading issues for expense reports even on fast network. I feel like the website is now more reliable than the mobile app now, that‚Äôs one sad state of affairs given that the website looks like it was made in the year 2000 | Where did the camera go on the first page to take a picture of a receipt? Are you trying to make the UX worse?! | I don‚Äôt write app reviews, but for 7 years of using this app for work on 6 different devices (3 Apple, 3 pixel), it has by far been the most frustrating app I‚Äôve ever encountered (this includes all of my kids apps). Times out 70% of the time I use it. Extremely slow..whether booking travel, logging expenses or even loading approvals for my direct reports. I loathe having to use it. | One star is very generous for this app. Easily the slowest and most difficult app I‚Äôve ever had to deal with. EVERY time I open it, it spins endlessly. I finally have to close it out and try again. It‚Äôs annoying. I‚Äôve tried updating it and same thing happens. | Latest update no good. Long authentication, took away features | Circles and circles. Won‚Äôt login on or update. | Overall, I like it for the expediency with my group, but every time I start one I have to tap around and tap around and then finally I figure out how to submit it | Two pay periods in a row I have not received reimbursement for what has been submitted and approved timely. If you‚Äôre not going to pay people what they are owed when they are supposed to receive it then you need to let them know in advance and not the day they expecting a direct deposit in their account. People have bills to pay and can‚Äôt wait days for their reimbursement to hit their accounts. Now on top of regular bills there are late fees added on because you didn‚Äôt do your part. | Best expense writing software! It‚Äôs so easy to use. I‚Äôm done with reports | Do it faster. | The sign in process for this app is horrible.  You have to delete and reinstall the app to sign in. | The app is slow to load and just a little faster when up loading a rec! I could go on but I have to receipts to upload and only an hour to do it. Lol | I will not use the app anymore because 5 flights have been cancelled when booked thru this app.   I usually get an email the weekend before the trip saying the airline had a problem forcing me to call them.   Now they get to up charge for the call in.   Yes.  I did get email confirmations.  Yes I did call the airline direct and never received the booking.   While he webpage has its issues I don‚Äôt trust this app at all. | On the mobile app when you get a credit on a hotel bill you can not proceed with the credit. There‚Äôs not minus on the key pad. So now I have to got to laptop and finish my report. Since the update it went missing. You add it back and you get a 5. | App is slow in loading expense detials | The set up process for two factor authentication is a absolute joke. The codes never come through and then it tells you to login for help but you can‚Äôt login because you can‚Äôt to factor authenticate. This is extremely frustrating and it‚Äôs the same way no matter whether you use the website or the app, no one wants to deal with this when you‚Äôre simply trying to travel on business. | To many steps to fill in attendees | Can‚Äôt tell UBER is a ‚Äúcar service/taxi‚Äù?

Also, the app used to quickly determine transportation time based on whatever transportation mode I selected, and now it never figures it out.  Finally, I used to be able to easily move and rearrange the order of places to visit but now everything gets messed up when I try to do that.  When I first started using it I would have given it 5 stars but now I would give it zero if I could.  This app used to be perfect and now it is basically useless. | This app is great as everyone traveling in the group can see the plans on a given day. However, it‚Äôs difficult to have more than one activity in a day because it doesn‚Äôt let you set a start time for anything but the first activity. After that it assumes you are going directly to the next place. A little annoying as trips frequently have down time in between. | This is the first time using the app and am planning two trips simultaneously. I like it for the most part, once I figured it out it got easier. I am not able to edit the days, my travel partner imputed the wrong start date so that‚Äôs something I have to work around. Overall a pretty cool way for everyone to add to the itinerary and make the most of the trip!! | If I‚Äôm planning a trip to multiple cities it would be super useful to search and select a city vs a specific attraction. I thought at first this is what would happen when I selected a day and a map came up. Nothing happens when you do that. You can roam around in the map, but there is no ability to simply select a city as a way point. | I typically like using this app over TripIt. I like that it routes my activities on the maps and gives me allotted times of days depending on my duration. I like that it‚Äôs color coded by day. I like that it shows the drive time from one place to another. However....I would LOVE this app if it could Integrate our flights and hotel information and information of attractions, like tripit does. I would also like to edit an attraction by clicking it and assigning times by the minute. | ÊÑüË¨ùË®≠Ë®àÈÄôÂÄãËªüÈ´îÔºÅÂîØ‰∏ÄÁæé‰∏≠‰∏çË∂≥ÁöÑÂú∞ÊñπÊòØ‰∏çÁü•ÈÅìÁÇ∫‰ªÄÈ∫ºÊØèÊ¨°ÈõªËÖ¶Á∂≤È†ÅÁâàÁöÑËµ∑ÂßãÊó•ÊúüÁ∏ΩÊòØÊØîappÁâàÁöÑÊó•ÊúüÊèêÂâç‰∏ÄÂ§©Âë¢ÔºüÔºàÊòØÂõ†ÁÇ∫Á≥ªÁµ±Ëá™ÂãïË™øÊï¥ÁÇ∫Âè∞ÁÅ£ÊôÇÂçÄÂóéÔºüÔºâ | I‚Äôve been using Google Trips and it did a lot of things well, but it‚Äôs itinerary mapping features are lacking and this app has been very useful in completing the job Google left undone.

Thanks for the help in planning our family reunion!! | This was the best app to help with planning my vacation! I tell everyone to get it now! | Really good interface, nice functionality. | Super easy to arrange your travel schedule with your friends or family even your enemy! Lol nice app!! | As an avid traveler, I am VERY impressed with all this app has to offer and the hours it will save me with all of its amazing features! | Edit: My travel partner contacted the app developers and got an almost-immediate response.  They fixed the invite so that we were able to share the trip and though currently only the primary trip planner can make changes, that fix is coming. I'm excited to see what can be remedied. 

Well, I like the idea and the format, but there were a couple issues.  First I successfully was invited by a friend but when I attempted to invite her on the trip I had already set up, she never got the invite. Also, in an attempt to circumvent that I was going to add all of my itinerary to her trip but the app states I don't have permission to edit while not allowing her the option to grant permission. :-/ | Good app | It's super convenient to combine all the info together and google map. I love it's flexibility, can work offline and super easy to share with others. | Overall this app is excellent for creating a trip itinerary--using the app is fairly intuitive, and only takes a little while (10 min for me?) to figure out what you really need to start planning your trip. I especially appreciate the integration with Google maps (I think that's what it uses), and how you can save specific addresses (even residential ones) with nicknames (aliases). The developers have a good product with great potential :)

There are only two issues preventing me from giving the app 5 stars:
1) The travel time estimation feature for public transit in Japan (the area for which I am planning) doesn't work. As of this writing, the app only estimates driving time between locations (and sometimes walking times...but that's not exactly realistic when I need to go 30-40 km as quickly as possible). If this feature worked, it would help me greatly in realistically planning how many places I can actually visit in a day. 
2) The pop-up notification asking me to turn on location services comes up too often. Every single time I want to search or add a destination, it reminds me to turn location on. I prefer having it off, because having all the ""nearby places"" listed is distracting (and irrelevant right now, since I'm in a different country than the trip I'm planning for). Having the pop-up appear only when the app is opened would make for a much smoother, less annoying user experience. 

Aside from those two areas for improvement, I am really impressed with this app and thankful to the creators! | ÈÇÑÁÆóÂ•ΩÁî®ÁöÑappÔºå‰ΩÜÊúâ‰∏Ä‰∫õÂ∞èÂäüËÉΩ‰∏çÊòØÈÇ£È∫ºÈ†ÜÊâã„ÄÇ | I never could get this app to work. Very complicated and not at all useful. | ÈùûÂ∏∏Â•ΩÁî®ÁöÑË¶èÂäÉËªüÈ´îÔºåÂæàÈÅ©Âêà | Really useful!! | Overall it's a good app, user friendly.
One way it can be better is by letting us to add some notes into it rather than just adding location of here and there..
looking forward for improvements..
=] | This app is so cool. It really helpful for me, and help to efficiently manage my trip a lot. Even a short trip, I could be easy to handle it and change my schedule.

Specially in this ever changing environment of Covid as there change and refund system is total crap. Flights cancelled due to pandemic restriction by different countries are being charged to customer by cleartrip (looting people money) as in my case other people who booked on same airline directly got full refund.

Taiwan belongs to China. Idk what this app is trying to do.üòÖ | App it‚Äôs no compatible with this version of IOS | Hasn‚Äôt opened for me in weeks. Also don‚Äôt appreciate how people try to use this as a dating app :/ | I would really like it if in the section in the profile where it asks for your nationality, there was a way to add multiple because most people are not just one ethnicity | When first started using was great but some kind of bug now is preventing me logging in again with Apple ID. It keeps exiting app when I try and I‚Äôve tried resetting account & support is no where to be found. | The app is great for solo travel. The only problem is the lack of users on the app. I don‚Äôt really find many users on it. Some form of heavy marketing could make this app the best solo traveler app in the world. Had good features but still the app is pretty basic. | !!! | Everything is great the only problem is the moroccan map cut to half we have a lot of tourists visiting morocco thinking the west side is not moroccan please correct this mistake morocco is from tangier to Guerguerat . | This app needs some work!!!! Crashes every 2 seconds. Love the potential behind it but it can‚Äôt even perform basic functions. Please figure it out. | The app is really cool and works well. I have a goal to visit all 50 us states as well so I wish the app had that tracking capability. | This app was recommended to me by a friend because we were looking for something to do in Italy and this app came in so handy!!! We found a kind and fun group of people that made it so fun and since it was our first time, we didn't know what to do but they definitely had everything planned out and we did more than what we would've if we were alone plus we made so many new connections and friends. The service is top-notch, the community is great, the interface is easy to navigate, and there are so many options to choose from. I usually never write reviews but I feel this app deserved one. 10/10 | I like the concept of the app ever since download i‚Äôve been having a hard time using the functions ( iphone 13 pro max) 

-Updating anything within profile takes a while or app freezes 

-Certain joined groups don‚Äôt appear anymore after joined 

I‚Äôve attempted to uninstall & reinstall app but now unfortunately i‚Äôm unable to login anymore.

it was working fine at first. | I assume this app is full of bots because the retention rate for people is next to none. Everyone makes a group chat and says where they‚Äôre going to go and what time but no one text among each other maybe once in a blue moon but it‚Äôs so uncoordinated they can only make sense that the developers have better things to do since the app hasn‚Äôt been updated in a month, it is very bad and it‚Äôs going to be very rare for you to find anyone to travel with since no one stays on the app longer than a day | This is a fantastic app that helps you connect with people before you even arrive somewhere.  You can find others with similar interests or destinations in mind and really make the most of the experience with someone to share it with.  An absolutely incredible way to expand your travel dreams and the friends you meet along the way!! | ‚ÄúWould you like to sign in with your apple id?‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you like to sign in with your apple id?‚Äù | Haven‚Äôt had a chance to use this in action but have already been reached out to by multiple cool folks from around the globe. Can‚Äôt wait to use this, interface is great!! | TravelBFF is a super cool app that helps you meet new friends from all over the world and travel with them. It's like having a global buddy to explore exciting places with.

It's like having your own tour guide. | Amo esta aplicaci√≥n, te ayuda a conectar y conocer personas de todo el mundo puedes planear viajes juntas. Me encantaü©µ | downloaded this app to see what trips were available for summers because i‚Äôm in school, plenty of trips and destination groups. The whole app is very clean looking and programmed nicely | I‚Äôve been thinking of solo traveling so this app was perfect to find friends no matter where I choose to travel. | This app is the best thing that happened to me. Very easy to use and to understand, they have a premium feature which can be a con for some people but it is only 4.99 and you can do SO much! I love their teleport feature where you can see travelers all over the world and message them! Keep at it guys! | To be honest, this app would have been a cool idea but it is executed very poorly. The app is all over the place. As an avid traveler, I wouldn‚Äôt use this app. Who is going to actually go on a trip with strangers they don‚Äôt know, unless it‚Äôs organized by a company or creator?? That is danger ready to happen. I was happy to see that they added travelers nearby, the only feature I found great, but now I can‚Äôt use it, because it costs money a month, why would I pay when I can use the same feature on tinder, bumble bff, hostel world or going solo? What a joke. Like the idea, hate the execution. Hopefully they can step it up.. | As the title says. The app itself needs work and hence they monetize the part that makes up for what it lacks:

You are unable to send messages to localities or places near you, only countries. So if you live in NY, USA you'd be messaging all of the US. Additionally, they monitored the ""near me"" feature which is the only way of finding people genuinely near you. wow. | But here is the problem, the app has low hertz(fps). If you can fix that, it is gonna be perfect | Just started using this app and its a great concept. Already connected with some people visiting my city. Got some points i hope get looked at by the developers-

Improvement:
- add more subcategories for countries like the US where each state could be its own travel destination
- add user verification, hard to travel with people you've never met especially via a social platform

Other add-ons which would be great to see -
- maybe have the option for people to become ‚Äúlocal experts‚Äù or ‚Äútravel gurus‚Äù. Being based out of NY i have a lot of valuable insight for the many people coming here and have found myself sharing the same restaurants and places to see in many of the groups. If I had a page  could have all of that in one place for people to view and follow if they like my content. 
Could also incorporate past trips onto this page, if i have visited paris and know some great locations i could outline it on a map or with a button to take people to the map location. | I just downloaded this app and I am so excited to use it to make likeminded friends! Traveling can be so overwhelming but when you can have everything you need in one app it helps make things more seamless!!! | best invention really easy app to use highly recommend for anyone seeking more travel in life!! get on it you won‚Äôt regret it!! | Just uploaded this app it‚Äôs really fun | It‚Äôs has been a pain to find a travel buddy specially when the trip is on business days as most our people are working or busy with something else. With the app I could find a travel buddy in the easiest way, our dates were just the same in the same city which is AMAZING. I truly recommend this app for solo travelers, you can find someone in your destination whom is available to share with you time and create new experiences. | I got to meet new people less nervous about traveling now it‚Äôs so much more fun | I love this app!! It makes it super easy to find travel buddies & connect with people who have similar ways of traveling & similar interests! Highly recommend! | I am very impressed with the number of options, and yeah finally an app that will make an impact on people who feel like they need something more in their life. | i'm bilingual but i cant like show it on the app because they don't have hebrew and many backpackers are israeli. | I travel a lot both with my wife and by myself, and I‚Äôm a huge people person, so I love finding new people who love to explore. Experiences are better shared! | I‚Äôm aupair and I use to be in a hundred of WhatsApp groups for found someone to travel with. This app it‚Äôs so good. I have everything in the same place. And it‚Äôs giving me more trips ideas too. 
Thanks! I love it! | Really cool app, like it so far! | TripBFF is extremely helpful when traveling!! I love Solo Traveling a lot and the app gave me the amazing opportunity to connect with other people and meet up and explore the world together! It used to be so hard for me to find people to travel with but since I‚Äôve been using the app it has made it so much easier! I‚Äôm recommending TripBFF to everyone who loves to travel:) | This is such a great app! I was a little hesitant at first but it surprised me. It is very easy to use and you can filter exactly what you are looking for to travel. It great! | Just downloaded this app after seeing it come up on Instagram. First impressions so far are that it‚Äôs easy to make a post/respond to others sorted by country and interests. I also like the ‚Äúplan‚Äù section which has similar posts to travel Facebook groups but also has some more niche interests/opportunities. Looking forward to using the app more for my upcoming travels and to give me ideas on where to go next! | This app is very straight forward for everything. where your going, what you would be doing, and the purpose for it. You can connect with other people you are going to travel with before you even meet them which I think is pretty cool so I would definitely recommend this app to other people. | Such a good tool to use when traveling to connect with minded people on the same journey as you! Excited to use this on my next solo trip! | Must get if traveling europe alone! Especially if youre in your 20‚Äôs | App page is easy to use, along the way there‚Äôs always room for improving for UI. But I been imagined this App and now it‚Äôs finally here!! | So excited to use this on my upcoming trips! Such a fun cool way to connect with likeminded people around the world üåéü´∂üèº | I wish I had found out about this up sooner. This is such a necessity for solo travelers, I feel so comfortable and excited to meet people who have the same traveling interests me, and are in the same age range. It is extremely easy to connect, find opportunities, and even make your own catered to whatever audience you please. | The owner of the app, immediately spammed my inbox and left negative reviews on my Instagram page (Ethan B.). Not sure why they would treat their customers that way, really poor customer service.

My booked flight appears and disappears, very inconsistent and frustrating when trying to check in for flight. App performance also is slower compared to other apps. | unbeaten üî• | Very weak web site.  Worst in class. | Why? | Very clunky, especially parts that rely on website link. All kinds of gotchas re adding additional checked bags - forcing you to do it at airport for usurious blackmail prices.  Chat support staff poorly trained, uninformed, powerless and slow. After over an hour with one got disconnected and couldn‚Äôt reconnect with her - next agent asked me to hold and disappeared for 40mins and never came back.  Tried calling and agent incrementally better but still couldn‚Äôt resolve problem and promised call back before 7pm but now 8pm and no call back.  SQ inflight staff are good but the rest of the company has withered, all blame goes to top management. | I input my information ahead of time in an effort to save time and then when I come back to check in - all my information is gone and I have to re-input it.  This happened on the outgoing portion of my trip too. | I have been trying for over a week to pick my seats on the app and the app keeps freezing. I have relatives with same issue. We have open and closed app, reinstalled. Nothing fixed it. Pls fix the app so we can choose seats | This app failed to list four bookings that I made. It‚Äôs made me nervous and started wondering what was going on. | Please add ‚Äúadd for my calendar‚Äù. When checking in, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that even when logged in, app prompts to re-enter member number when info is on previous page. | Outstanding capabilities of this app | Can‚Äôt get back to where I have been file up
Add don‚Äôt allow to add passenger after booking

Don‚Äôt have split ticket in app | Singapore is great but their app needs serious help, so unintuitive | Useless airlines , don‚Äôt provide option to select seats even during checkin. Looks autocratic piece of junk | I have to add my trips manually and it does not even carryover between two versions of the app. | I have changed password multiple times. It's not able to log me in the app but web browser works fine. Fix that issue asap! | Although Singapore airline is the best airline in the world. Even coming from a Malaysian. The app is missing some key things that other flight app offer.

For one, boarding pass is only available 1.5 hrs before boarding. Why??? Many other apps provides them regardless.

2nd, the lack of implementation of adding the boarding pass to Wallet is annoying. I really hope this app can be as good as the food on the plane. Thanks. | Easy check in online, underground service good, the crews are polite and patient. Inflight meal, all is good. Seats are bigger and comfortable. Certainly we will fly SQ again. | I‚Äôve had to change my password 6 times. Works fine on web, but app locks me out. | Check in procedures are very easy rather than other airlines | The fact that their chat service doesn‚Äôt allow autocorrect and thus troubles you to correct spelling all the time is extremely frustrating. Despite having told their customer service to raise this with their app developers multiple times for the past 24 months, they haven‚Äôt done anything with it and it shows me, that SQ doesn‚Äôt care about wasting its travellers‚Äô time and has no problem with this nuisance. It‚Äôs 2023, how can you not have corrective spelling on your live chat is beyond me. It‚Äôs the most basic thing. 

Additionally the app continues to crash when staying in the live chat for over 10-15 minutes. Had to start the same conversation over 3 times. Luckily I gave the last agent my number in case the app would crash (which it did!) so she could call me (which she did). 

 Also can‚Äôt seem to login on the app since a few days. The Face Recognition gets activated, but despite it saying it‚Äôs OK, it not OK, as I cannot see my Account Details. 1 star for that. Otherwise potentially 4 stars. | It‚Äôs good but not great | Every time I open the application 90% of the time it keeps saying ‚Äúsomething is wrong.‚Äù  After the latest update 22.47.0 all my future is gone and I must input manually. | Some of the tools that are available in the app are not user friendly. For instance, the seat map for small flights loads in portrait mode. However for bigger flights, you just get a blank screen. Took me a couple of attempts to figure out that I needed to flip my phone to landscape mode to see anything. | One month to get updates on my tickets | Lots of login issues since, and most of the booking management is still federated to the web app. The user interface is slow and clunky. I would expect so much more from an airline that has an amazing flying experience. If you want to know want an amazing airline app looks like, try Delta. | I‚Äôm flying with 2 young kids (4 & 7). When I purchased the ticket I realized there are not any three seats next to each other,  I tried to contact customer service and the response is it is what it is, suggest us to try to sit closer (even it‚Äôs rows apart from each other). | Singapore flight was fine but the way they handled us last May, leaves me selecting other airlines.  We booked our flight through Singapore airlines. They put us on Alaska airlines for the first part of our trip. We were to catch a connection in California which was then to bring us to Singapore.  Alaska was running 15 minutes late. I contacted Singapore air and Alaska air. They assured me I would make my connections. However, when arriving in California, both Alaska air and Singapore air did not offer any assistance in getting to our connection. We arrived to the gate 15 minutes before flight take off but because they closed the door, we could not board. Singapore gate attendant was rude and told us we needed to sleep in the airport and they would get us on a flight the next day.  It was our 40th Anniversary and we were to be in Australia to care for our grandson while my daughter was in labor. Singapore air didn‚Äôt care. They refused to allow us on the flight, which sat st the gate an additional 10 minutes while we were sitting right there. They refused to assist us in getting a place to sleep.   Finally, Alaska air offered to put us up for the night.   We did not book through Alaska air but they were the one who came to our help. Singapore air, who the entire booking was through, did nothing.  Gate staff was very cold and rude.   We will not fly with them again | I‚Äôm a PPS customer, and use the app quite a bit.  Or at least I used to.  Recently I am unable to log in.  Face recognition initiates whenever I open the app, I get the ‚Äúcheck‚Äù that it‚Äôs successful - but I don‚Äôt actually get logged on.

Not useful and frustrating.

Love SIA.  The app‚Ä¶not so much. | The app is not working. I have been trying to redeem the same ticket for over a week. When I called to ask for help getting the site to work, they sold me two tickets for almost 800 more than what I could have bought it on the site. When I tried to write to get help to redeem tickets, I was told to submit a written request and someone would get back to me in 3 weeks. When I just tried for the 100th time to transfer miles from
My sons account, it would not let me pay cash for the transfer but required me to use miles as the only way to make the transfer work. I‚Äôve spent 10-15 hours trying to make this one trip work and to transfer miles from my sons account. This trip is cost me 15000 more miles and $800 more because I tried to use the app. I‚Äôm more than frustrated. I‚Äôve been elite Gold the last couple years  and near PPS holder this year. The switch from Delta Airlines where I was platinum was a difficult choice for me to make but I made the choice and I keep having these kinds of problems on your app. I don‚Äôt feel very valued. And I feel significant frustration with this particular effort to try and use the promised rewards. | Completing your profile and receiving an OTP is the most frustrating process I have been at it for 2 hrs still not completed what a waste of time and effort. OTP is extremely sporadic.
üëéüëéüëé | They canceled my flight and wouldn‚Äôt give a refund. It‚Äôs now 10 months I been desperately trying to get my refund for the canceled flights. If you go with this company just know when they cancel your flight you won‚Äôt get a refund. They will delete your e ticket number when they ‚Äúescalate‚Äù the matter... they said they have processed the refund, but now after 8 weeks later they said ‚Äúwe never processed the refund‚Äù.  SCAMMER BEWARE. 

Edit: It has now been 1 year and still NO REFUND. You won‚Äôt get one from this company. | I booked my ticket online with an obvious mistake with the dates, leaving Singapore within one day after arriving from New York and traveling 24 hours to celebrate Chinese New Year‚Äôs. When I tried to rectify the error, I was charged a penalty for it. Being a Gold Krisflyer member was pointless , I tried to speak to the manager/supervisor to make my case but was refused. Would definitely think twice before booking this airline again. | iPhone version of the app refuses to accept username and password. I‚Äôve confirmed the ability to log in through a web browser and the android app with the same credentials. | It‚Äôs been now twice since US airlines have left me out hanging to dry ‚Äî and each time, Singapore Airlines has taken Home and back. I‚Äôve been making trips to my second home, Malaysia, since I was a child. It was only in the past six months in which a particular airline has either A., A poorly planned itinerary, or B., airlines tickets with myself and my 10yo son were booked on two different flights. For A, I received a call stating that I need a visa to enter Japan, so I had to burn the ticket. I used Singapore Airlines to get me Home the first time. For B, I got to Narita and had a transfer in Haneda. Got to Haneda and they informed me my son‚Äôs ticket and my ticket weren‚Äôt reissued at the same time, so my ticket was canceled and his we had to miss the flight. So there I was again, stuck ‚Äî again, both times, I‚Äôve used this phone app to make booking so painless and SQ was able to save my vacation. Nowadays, I don‚Äôt even care about the burned tickets; I will NEVER EVER use another US airline to get me to Asia. Thank you so much! Beautiful application with slick feel. As someone in IT with 10+ years experience ‚Äî this is how it‚Äôs done. Everyone else take note, as all integrations work seamlessly. No lagging and infrastructure is tip-top. | ‚ÄúLive chat‚Äù is a constant fail. Check-in function a disappointment of sadness. This app, much like the airline, is to be avoided if possible. | The App check in is cumbersome. 
It asks for all the details again like Address, emergency contact, visa status etc - even though all this was entered when the ticket was purchased. 

It also asks for this for each passenger. Linking details to the first passenger doesn‚Äôt work for a child. 

Also it makes the man the first passenger.  In our case I made myself the first passenger (female) when we made booking. We are a family of three. I also have a higher reward profile. Yet after the tickets were issued it made my husband the first passenger.  This is annoying as I do all the admin with flights - and therefore would like to use my contact details not my husbands. 

Lastly with the App and website - the performance is unusually slow. | Liked being able to check in early & meal & seat selection, but other things are not great -

 Problems with passwords, separating out adult travelers traveling together but having separate  Singapore customer numbers‚Ä¶, re-entry of data such as home addresses (which seems like it would have been saved for duration of 10 day trip), | Can‚Äôt even log in because password field says ‚Äúplease enter a valid password‚Äù even when filling the password that works on the web interface. | My booking is with a group that‚Äôs traveling together but I‚Äôm grouped with 3 members of the group that requires information that strictly pertains to those travelers. We each should have our own booking number for the flight. | I‚Äôm not frequently travel to see my family who‚Äôs living in Indonesia, when i does I always choose Singapore airlines because of safety and comfortable | Any sensible person should abstain from using this Airlines.it is super expensive and it‚Äôs a 
Losing battle to make reservations online.
It is a high time for them to make this people friendly! Thanks | I have been traveling in Singapore Airlines last 14 years . After COVID the Asian people on the SFO airport counter became very rude and aggressive. I have cancelled all my tickets that I planned for this year and next year . I am done with them .I will never ever fly again in Singapore airlines. | SQ app team - wake up! COVID vaccination certificates are no longer required by the government. Why do you still ask for them to get a digital boarding pass? And if you do, why don‚Äôt you fix the verification so it actually works with QRs issued by the government? | You iPad app is not working properly. Can‚Äôt enter password and showing it is not valid. Nothing changed on my end. | App is made for the airline to get customers. Very little information is available. Poor interface. Can‚Äôt find flight information or covid restrictions. Everything is written as such and such a country Might require a PCR test. | Why send messages to update the app to users on the latest app version? | I tried to do a check-in today but kept getting error. I was able to do it via the website. | What‚Äôs the point of making the app when I have to end up using the website to do all the things? I feel like the app still has bugs and some stuff don‚Äôt show up. When I tried to check in, I had a ‚Äúsorry something went wrong‚Äù error | Seriously, non-existent. It‚Äôs not that their customer service is bad, it‚Äôs that they DO NOT HAVE customer service. My name is incorrect in some parts of their system. I‚Äôve been trying for two weeks (via web form, chat, and phone calls where I waited on hold for 2+ hours) and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get any help.

Horrible website. Tricky presentation. They populate options not asked for and then make it difficult to correct their deceit. The fact that vouchers can only be used once towards a ‚Äúbase fare‚Äù . Make sure you find a fare that uses  your whole voucher amount. They keep the rest. I finally just forfeited the voucher rather than spend more time on site with clueless customer chat feature. Another time I had voucher letter in front of me. Copied it perfectly and surprise, surprise,  they couldn‚Äôt locate it. | Upon continuous updates TSA Pre‚úÖ will not appear under apple wallet on any  departing SJU (Puerto Rico) flights and would still have ui bugs not displaying the correct airport/destination if you have connecting flights (wrong order) | We almost missed a flight because the app had the wrong gate and we quit and opened the app multiple times but it did not refresh, we only realized after reaching the wrong gate. We only found the updated gate number after a google search with the flight number. | Just bad overall, slow updates bad UI does not give you the info you need or updates on your plane | Telling me I do not have miles when I have never redeemed any! No way to contact anyone to straighten this out!!! | Lost luggage and no numbers to talk to a real person. Worst customer service of all airlines. A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT NEEDS T O HAPPEN. | Beyond frustrating. I have a member number already. Please fix. | Still did not get my refund on my carry-on that I had to pay for $99!! I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be flying frontier anytime soon unless I get that refund back | The website is very difficult to maneuver. All my flights have been fantastic, just horrible to book! | Frontier is horrible with all their fees. No customer service. The only thing is cheap tickets and that‚Äôs all you get a cheap tickets. The website is the most horrible airline website I‚Äôve ever used. The layout is horrible. Did I mention the word horrible. I‚Äôve never had a free flowing experience using the app. | Got rid of Frontier Credit Card and Den membership due to fatigue over the crappy Frontier website. No customer service, pathetic software. Feels good to be free. | Try debit and another credit card | I tried to book a flight online. Could not book on my iPad or MacBook. Finally was able to book on my phone while waiting to chat online. | I have my pre TSA # in my profile and when I book my flights it doesn‚Äôt put it in my ticket information or let me add it.  It‚Äôs a huge problem as it is not easy to get ahold of anyone. | Almost lost my fly because their app and website weren‚Äôt working properly and had to paid a 50 dollar fee to do the check in person. Funny enough it was  Frontier and the fly was delay. Rude customer service. Rude people on the check in station. Worst experience so far with an airline. | I am a first time flyer, so take my experience with a grain of salt. However, I had a fairly positive experience with Frontier during my first time in the air as I headed to Philadelphia. It took about the same amount of time as they had predicted, the flight was smooth minus a tad bit of turbulence. The flight home though? What was supposed to be an 8:30am flight has been delayed going on 2 hours now, they made 40-ish people put their carry-on bags under the plane because of weight distribution issues, and even admitted they overbooked the flight and wanted volunteers who could wait until 10 PM TONIGHT for a new flight. Not only that, they did maintenance that no one was aware of until we were all on the plane, soon getting a text at 9am that we would be delayed. I sit, now typing this at 10:00am after having deboarded the plane because they kept us on too long. I understand they need to check the plane is functioning properly for us, but at no time was this issue directly communicated until we got off the plane. The lack of communication truly is appalling and I wish we were told why these things were happening more clearly. | thanks frontier ,i just hope i will have easy fly round trip. | Worst Airline experience of my life. App is equally useless. Please please listen to me and do no fly this sham company. I will never try to save a buck and use these fools again. Also going to look through all the mutual funds in my retirement account and make sure they do not invest in this company or their parents or affiliated brands.  If there was a review option for less than one star or negative stars I would smash it. | So very frustrated with Chat!!! A few weeks ago, I asked to speak to a resolution specialist (after ‚Äúchatting‚Äù for 15 minutes) and was never transferred!!!!!!
I strongly suggest either give the option freely OR better yet, allow customer to speak to a LIVE human being!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | They can‚Äôt get it right | There‚Äôs no ‚Äòback button‚Äô hence no way to review everything you‚Äôve selected before having to pay for it. Some things aren‚Äôt explained when looking at flight info. If you try to confirm your selected info, the app will start you all over again. Pain | No phone numbers....no customer service! No texting and no emails to let you know your flight has been delayed...They just are totally horrible...Maybe it's the airline industry in a nutshell..... | I had to make reservation about 10 times thru website and now phone app.  2 hrs.  Very disappointed and could not speak with anyone.  The BOT does not answer or understand issue. | Not easy to navigate. Stalling several times. | Every time you update they take more information. | I had booked the same flight with three other buddies flying out out Las Vegas to STL at around 6 am. I lost my phone in a taxi cab drivers car which was never returned (not frontiers fault) they were cleared to take the flight but told me I was unable to board because they had overbooked the flight!! somehow me not having my phone meant I couldn‚Äôt get on the same exact flight even though I had all my credentials. So I had to stay in the airport for 17 straight hours to wait for the next flight out to STL. All of this because frontier wanted to sell more tickets while a few others get screwed. They made no accommodations for me, no refund or anything. The front desk lady is just throwing luggage on the conveyer belt one suitcase topples over and she just throws it back on. 4.7 stars is an absolute joke I know for a fact that even spirit airlines is miles ahead of frontier.  Oh and the kicker is they charged me $20 for some unknown reason 3 days later. Will never fly with this airline again. Steer clear!! | Hands down- best flight pricing! | We are being charged $197 for two carry on bags and an overweight checked bag and the wait time to speak to someone is forever and we never got a person. Terrible customer service at the airport with the issue. | NEVER AGIAN will I fly on this amateur unprofessional ‚Äúairline.‚Äù  President: Barry L. Biffle should be fired or hang himself. I tried to check in one hour before my flight and there was NO ONE at the check in desk. They all decided to leave at the same time to go to the gate. I missed my flight and the next one wasn‚Äôt for 2 day so I booked with United. | Trying to book trip on ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù app and when it asks to select a bundle, the continue without bundle doesn‚Äôt work. There‚Äôs no way to scroll the pop up asking ‚Äúif sure (or something similar)‚Äù. Useless app as far as I‚Äôm concerned. | The change to the app means my Known Redress no. is no longer attaching to my ticket, so I don‚Äôt expect my boarding pass will show TSA Pre-check. I can‚Äôt check yet since the boarding passes aren‚Äôt issued until a few days before the flight. I don‚Äôt like that the updated app changes this feature. | Me encanta esta aplicaci√≥n puedo hacer mis vuelos directos y econ√≥micos. Tiene mucha flexibilidad | This app is the biggest piece of junk I‚Äôve ever seen. It would be great if it worked. It doesn‚Äôt. Works differently on different devices. Displays old boarding passes from weeks ago. Have to check in 1 person at a time AND retype paper #s. And it goes on and on. Just junk | I have a known TSA number‚Ä¶. For some reason it did not show up when I added our names to the reservation.  I had it on there before and had TSA precheck.  Your app would not let me add it. | After selecting my add on options, there was no notification of the cost of taxes and added fees until after I paid. Those charges increased to cost by 50%

Additionally, while I am making my selections, I am told that I have 24 hours to cancel. However after I do pay, I am told that the payment is nonrefundable. 

Either this app is very unclear or simply bad for customers. | I‚Äôve never been happy with my results from frontier | Great app | Been screwed three times by Frontier Airlines, but they are a monopoly. Wrote Frontier, no reply, wrote Federal Government, no reply, if there was any other choice I‚Äôd take it. | Spent over an hour trying to check my flyer miles tried online chat called useless numbers I am going to the airport but don‚Äôt have high hopes pathetic customer support | They will intentionally place you and your family member in different areas if you did not pay to sit together just so you can give them more money. With paying a extra $160 for one bag and $80 to sit t with your family you might as well go with Delta. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be doing from now on. They lost my family and myself as customers. | You need to list a phone number to reach a human agent. This is ridiculous. | Won‚Äôt populate my TSA pre check Number from my profile. Have to enter it separately later. Also if I go back to check anything like my flight times once I‚Äôm on checkout page, I have to fill everything out again going forward of that. Nothing major, just wastes time.
Otherwise the app works good. | I was trying to get a credit from a former flight but I couldn‚Äôt. The app is kind of treaky | The employees and just overall experience I had with frontier was less than a one star experience. | What this airline does to travelers is criminal. Stranding people in airports with no alternative but to rent cars and drive at late night even they cancel flights.  Offering nothing and having no customer service.  An airline should not be allowed to operate like that.  Flights are not cheap if you have to drive to your destination. It's amazing as most companies would be held accountable for such terrible operations. Do not risk your family to this airline. They are a complete 
Fraud. | Please bring back a Customer Service phone number for help with difficult questions. | A more straightforward pricing is better than multiple prompts across the flight booking process to just try and make up some additional $.
Clearly the analytics might be required to see if this strategy is working or it‚Äôs actually driving business on other carrier special in popular hubs like DFW. | I agree terrible customer service so frustrated. I spent a long time on the phone most of the day trying to figure out connect with someone, etc.. Get it together Frontier. | I just hope they don‚Äôt cancel the flight.

I have never been late on any bill, and you can check my credit score to confirm this.

Oxford, Massachusetts | After logging in the app sends me to a white screen with a red spinning ‚Äúwheel‚Äù. 2 weeks I‚Äôve tried to use this app, not once have I been able to log in | After years of overpaying, I came across this company and was in shock at how much I‚Äôve been overpaying over so many years my rep was awesome. I‚Äôm so glad I found this company and will not be going anywhere else. I highly recommend coming from someone who has tried a few different policies for many years and these guys really care about you and not just your money. The best customer service I‚Äôve ever had. I would give 1 million stars if I could. | App does not download | I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt find renewal information about my policy on the website. I can find billing info but the policy information for renewal is not there. Am I missing something? | Hard to get in keeps hour glassing | This app rarely loads and if you‚Äôre lucky enough to log on there‚Äôs always an error that prevents you from paying. Log on the website and same issue. | i‚Äôve had the hardest time w this app. it used to be so easy , now the app can‚Äôt find my policy. i almost never ant to switch insurances. | My agent recommended Travelers. I paid in full for one year..cars, home, earthquake, umbrella. Every month since there has been a charge for something they changed, some forgotten item. Any savings I was told I was getting is long gone. | No apparent reason.  Payment repeatedly failed | Roadside assistance screen is frozen after you confirm a vehicle | I‚Äôve tried to pay my bill numerous times via different payment methods and the app won‚Äôt work. Requires me to call. So frustrating. | App rarely to never will let you log in. Their website has got just as bad. Policy doesn‚Äôt even show up in account but shows you owe them In billing section but won‚Äôt let you pay. Just awful. A call to customer service resulted in agent saying he would call back and never did. | I can‚Äôt even get the Travelers App to open. It just spins and spins. So frustrating. | I haven‚Äôt been able to log in since I downloaded the app | This app is infuriating if you ever need to actually use it. After you log in, it takes forever to actually load. | I was a loyal customer without any status change as far as wrecks or tickets and my payment doubled. I will be switching carriers | iPhone app library shows this app as Utility category. Generally the insurance app is classified as Finance. Developer needs some changes. | This is one of the hardest apps to navigate and find the info you need.  Should be easier to see your policies,   Cost and upgrade costs.  Of course calling doesn‚Äôt help either. | Easy to use | I can‚Äôt see anything. I just get the wheel of death and no data | It won‚Äôt even let me log in; it just sits there thinking until it crashes. Unbelievable, considering how much I pay them in insurance premiums every month. We will be forced to call them for help. Yikes. | Every time I go anywhere with a friend in my golf cart it tracks me it‚Äôs very annoying | La mejor compa√±√≠a de seguros que e visto gracias | I switched insurances, used the app once & worked like normal. Now for 2 weeks every time I try to log in it just stays in a loading screen after inputting my info. The website works fine otherwise. iPhone 15 | For iPad, this app needs to allow rotation to landscape display. | In the process of setting up my account, I selected the option to have all my correspondence mailed to me for billing and insurance coverage documents, but the system asked a tricky question then changed me to paperless billing.  Once I said GOT IT to the question that wasn‚Äôt pertaining to going paperless or not, it changed me to paperless billing.  I WISH TO RECEIVE ALL OF MY HOME INSURANCE CORRESPONDENCE VIA MAIL NOT THRU PAPERLESS BILLING.  PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK TO MAIL. | When logging in the Travelers app only displays an error code. The only way I can access. My Travelers account is online or calling an agent directly. This has been ongoing for the past two weeks despite talking to tech-support. | I‚Äôve had issues for maybe 2 weeks logging in on the app. It says my password or email is incorrect but when I try to reset my password it says that it must be different than my current password no matter what I put in. Just use web browser version | The app on my phone does NOT work! I can‚Äôt even login! I have to go to the actual web page to do anything. What‚Äôs the point of having the app? Please fix this!!! | Not | Payment won‚Äôt work no matter how many times I try | Lots of down time Dec 26, 2023 @0630- still down at 0910. Dr davis | Have no issue logging in on a web browser, but I cannot login on the app, as it believes I am not a Travelers customer. Used to be a great app, but I‚Äôve been having random issues like this for the past few updates. | Tried and tried. Gave up and mailed a check. Great job!! | I was supposed to get a tow today at 3 o‚Äôclock and it‚Äôs 6 o‚Äôclock now and I still don‚Äôt have a tow and haven‚Äôt heard from Travelers in three hours. Don‚Äôt get Travelers because they won‚Äôt do what they say they would. | Can‚Äôt stay logged into the app any longer than half a minute before being kicked out. When signed in, app seems to contain all the right information related to my policy, I just can‚Äôt do anything before the app automatically logs me out. Not usable. | Doesn‚Äôt load when I sign in‚Ä¶ tried to reinstall too. | N/A | This app want allow me to log in. Every time I put in my log in information it will say‚Äù Sorry something went wrong and you have been logged out. But I was never logged in to begin with.

To Timeout.jp kept popping up with a fake google prize drawing. Deleted. | All the guides are for small towns in the US like in Alabama?! What is with this? | It seems to be a useful map app, but some points of interest aren't listed, even well known ones like Sanrio Puroland. I'd figure with a map app specifically for Tokyo, it would have all shops, restaurants, and POI. My Google Maps app shows more places than this one. It'd be a 5-star app if all places had info on it. | We used this every day during our 5 days in Tokyo to plan the major sights and track our progress. The offline feature is key for foreign visitors. | I've used Ulmon maps many times for multiple cities in multiple countries, and I can't say just how much they've helped me to get right to where I was going. You almost miss the adventure of getting lost! | Everything you  need to plan a trip to tokyo | I like the combo of articles and great maps | This app dinged me with review requests at several critical moments while I was trying to find my way around Tokyo. So I felt compelled to write a review about how underwhelming it was. I needed a good offline map with street names, but this is really only good when you know the places you want to go. The UI was a little clunky and I would have appreciated the ability to see all my pins on the map. | I've never been to Tokyo before, and I found this quite useful. There is no navigation, but the maps are quite accurate, and it's easy to plot out your course using the phone's GPS. You can locate and save locations to an easily accessible list, and make multiple lists. Free wifi is VERY limited in Tokyo (Starbucks is your friend!) so this was essential. One caveat, using it to navigate for prolonged periods is obviously a rapid power drain. My strategy has been to use this app, google maps when I have wifi, and a good paper map to reduce power consumption. Add street names, and I'll add a star. | The beat way to plan your trip.  You can mark your spots and plan ahead, then you can rely on the app without internet | Zoom into the street level of places like Tokyo, and the names of the streets and blocks are all blank except for the main, larger roads and highways. Pretty worthless if you ask me. | I have used these apps in Europe and Japan and I can't recommend them enough, especially for Japan where you can get lost 10 times a day. Never again! | These guides are very helpful and the maps are easy to use and up to date. | So far the best free offline Tokyo map. | Saves me multiple times from getting lost. It'll be even better if you guys would create maps for more cities, because I'm moving to only using Ulmon for navigation purposes but it doesn't have all the cities.  Keep up the good work! | Very useful | This app the best!!! Worked amazingly while in Tokyo!! | This app is very unstable and keeps crashing on my iPhone 5 running iOS 7. Very frustrating. Unless fixed there is no reason to bother installing it. | Quite simply, this is an awesome app.  It got me all around Tokyo with ease, unhooked from the Net yet always knowing my location  and direction.  Thank you! | Great app, I can sync the spots I want to visit in Tokyo to my iPad and back to my iPhone. This is the app to use in Tokyo I think. | Great app! The gps works with out and cell phone service so that you can find what you need with out having to get an expensive overseas phone plan. Plus it has a list of all of the mister donuts. | So far I am enjoying this app in preparation for my trip to Tokyo. | I really love this app. navigate the crazy streets of tokyo without turning on data roaming.

Thank you! | Great for having everything you need all in one place. | Easy to navigate which makes it convenient. | We are doing Thai and Cambodia trip.
The outline in the book provided is pretty straight forward.  Had a little hiccup first stop at Bangkok airport, a call placed and within few minutes the issue was solved.
The places chosen to visit have been extraordinary exquisite.  There is time to rest /catch your breath between sites | The app is a convenient reminder of the trip itinerary | Very helpful with itinerary of course, but more importantly links to maps, directions, food in the vicinity, numbers/contacts and so much more. I LOVE having this tool for our Laos trip | Though I didn‚Äôt use all that often it was always close at hand and could give me an immediate update re weather. 
I don‚Äôt use apps that much but was pleased. Those that use them a lot should be very happy. | We turned to AudleyTravel several years ago when traveling to Peru with a disabled friend. After that great experience, we knew we could turn to them when too little time was left to us to plan our African journey. Jeremy took careful notes on our preferences and developed a terrific itinerary, fitting in many key spots while leaving enough time for self exploration.  AudleyTravel representatives/affiliates in Africa were wonderful- guesthouse owners and local guides specifically.  A couple of small requests were dealt with efficiently and helpfully while we were in Africa. Thus a really special trip!!  We look forward to our next adventure with them! | So impressed with the AudleyTravel app! Very user friendly and helps prepare you for each day‚Äôs adventure ü§ó | Really enjoying this app to keep us on target for our trip goals! | This is so handy to have electronically, I‚Äôve used it on several trips and love it! | We haven‚Äôt gone on our trip yet, but I feel much better prepared to enjoy it more fully from using this app. I look forward to keeping a journal with photos of our travels.  We are going to many places and Audrey has given us a variety of options for our free time .  Great app! | Terrific to have access while out an about and not needing to carry of printed guide. | Especially helpful for providing flight updates and information on where to board, etc. | Audley is a 5 star company! | Very useful while traveling!! | Excellent. | Thorough, in depth and covers more than I would have expected.  Top notch app which I am sure we will use every day. Excellent! | Very useful for keeping up to date on my travel and excursions itineraries by just looking on my cell. Highly recommended. | I found this app extremely useful during our trip to Vietnam and Thailand. We can always open it and get a quick insight of the itinerary and the tours for any day. 
It would be even greater if you can get the restaurant suggestions too. 
Nice tool! | This is a phenomenal app with so much information about every travel topic you could think of.  Plus there are fabulous pictures and room to write your memories underneath.
However I can‚Äôt get the site on my iPhone only on my iPad which is heavy to travel with.  Can someone help me with this?  iPad and iPhone are not talking to each other.üò© | .... making Itinerary and trip details immediately accessible!  No paper! | The Audley trip app was very user friendly.  It helps keep the pictures organized by day and locations. Notes were easy to add. | I love the Audley App,  everything at my fingertips to see pictures, details & plans for each day. | That‚Äôs what I like about it if you don‚Äôt want to spend money on data | We‚Äôre at our gate 3 hours early.  Ready to go!  Thank you Audley for all the arrangements. | Talia helped us arrange the trip of a lifetime (at least so far...) that included 3 locations in Spain, uniting all 3 of our family groups in 3 locations in Morocco, and providing a delightful stay for 2 of our family groups in Lisbon. My personal favorite experiences were in Barcelona, Spain and Lisbon, Portugal (both for fantastic food, great explorations, and fascinating histories.... explained clearly by local private tour guides arranged by Audley). Even though we all spent a night in desert tents in Morocco, (even riding dromedaries!) 2 of the family groups are seriously considering returning to the Moroccan desert for a longer, more in depth experience! | Everything in one place. I didn‚Äôt realize how useful it is until I started using it. Really made the trip foolproof. | I relied totally on this app for our month-long trip to Africa. And it was a lifesaver!!!

NJepp | We have done 3 previous trips with Audley and every time the trip has gone flawlessly. On our India trip we had to leave early due to a family emergency and Audley took great care in changing all of our plans. Thanks again to the best travel arranger. | Great way to keep track of your trip and where you go each and every day without consulting the travel book supplied.
Way to go Audley!! | The Audley app is really helpful, keeping all necessary information at my fingertips at all times. It is great to be able to upload additional documents, as well - e.g., travel insurance docs (if purchased elsewhere), and other relevant docs one may have. It is also really handy to have contact information immediately at hand, should it be needed. The app simply reflects a solid company - I‚Äôm very happy to have chosen Audley. | The Audley travel app was very helpful in quickly looking up information on our daily travel itinerary. | I have personally researched and curated our family trips for years. I was skeptical and hesitant to use a travel agent. Now,I wonder why I haven‚Äôt done this sooner!!!!! We had the most extraordinary tour guides, hotels and itineraries, which I would have spent hours researching and not have known the local scene in the way our guides did. The hotels were perfect. The itinerary was perfect. Audley was an incredible travel partner!!! | Detailed, informative, and flexible- adaptable and personable itinerary and great reference throughout the trip! | Guides and tours have been excellent. 
Aveni de Oliveira really knows the birds of Igua√ßu even by exact habitat and sound.  
  Our setup in Buenas Aires and also in Igua√ßu has been good for location, service and general quality. | Nailed it. Well done. | This app works better than the last one.    Nice to have all my info in such a convenient format | Well designed app, very helpful & easy to access. | I love the audley app and the audley team. Huge attention to detail and a lot of thought went into the app as well | Great app to have on a trip. Contains all the information you need to have a worry-free trip. The Journal is an easy way to keep friends and family join in your adventure. | Made it quite easy to follow my trip and easily access all of my information. | I was loving the app until the update today. I am now unable to log in, it cancels out before getting to authorization screen. | This is a brilliant idea. It‚Äôs such a convenient way to follow the itinerary with all of the necessary travel information at my fingertips!!  I love being able to use the journal as well.

It‚Äôs unbelievable. | This is a very good app. I really like the free flowing way to buy tickets. It could use a little bit more features but so far so good. I‚Äôve never had a problem using the app purchasing my tickets getting all the information I needed for my trip. | The app its excellent and easy to use. However, the person who drove us here was very rude and we had to ask about stopping to the restroom and he ignored us and we had to ask again and then he told us we were stopping in five minutes. | The refunds team is a huge disappointment I lost over $100 because of a small error and called within seconds to hear that my ticket cannot be changed. Stay away! | Stupid because of service fee.

The bus gets delayed for hours on end. People take your seat, and there‚Äôs been issues with bus drivers not being able to scan the qr. Sometimes they don‚Äôt even send the qr by email you have to have the app. | They are reap offs , they change time without giving proper information and the driver and not even willing to help for nothing . | Excelente gracias | Who‚Äôs trying to get my day on you another man in the system | I keep getting notifications about a FlixBus I had considered using. I can‚Äôt find the app in the Notifications section of the settings on my iPhone, so I can‚Äôt turn off these notifications. Can you help? | Gracias por sus servicios... | FlixBus will ask you to be at the station 30 minutes before schedule but bus will fail to show up 40 minutes after departure time, and no explanation or apologies will be offered. You can‚Äôt claim a refund of your ticket because administrative charges will consume most of it. 

Poor poor serviceüëéüèæüëéüèæüëéüèæ | No problem with the app. However I have had 3 of my trips of cancelled in the last few months FOR NO REASON. My last trip, the driver made a stop to get gas and wouldn‚Äôt let us get on the bus for 25 minutes and we were forced to stand in the cold. There are always issues with this bus carrier, go elsewhere | I bought a ticket from Tacoma to Ellensburg, which in the past was fine. The ticket had the usual information, which in this case was the location of the bus stop, how long, and which carrier (flix, greyhound, or northwestern) Not only was the route I bought a ticket for NOT AVAILABLE. I was told to go to two different customer service reps (first greyhound, then northwestern). I can‚Äôt even get my money back for a service that wasn‚Äôt provided. Additionally, it‚Äôs a KNOWN ISSUE that hasn‚Äôt been resolved for weeks. Why are tickets being sold for routes that don‚Äôt exist? Furthermore, the service rep I spoke to was beyond rude, at this point I had traveled from AL to WA and was waiting for the bus in the cold. This is the 3rd time this happened. Never using this service again.

EDIT:

BECAUSE of their error, I had to first call 2 different companies to get a refund. And now I have to wait another day to get to my home because their error pushed everything back too the point that the ONLY ROUTE I COULD TAKE HOME CLOSED. 100% awful experience due to the incompetence of this company and I can‚Äôt even go home.

NEVER AGAIN. | Excelente atenci√≥n y calidad muy c√≥modas las unidades | To give one star is even too much. strangers sat in our seats and after contacting the driver, no one does anything. This is not counting the cases when they left people and left without them. I won't go or use Flixbass again. | My bus was delayed 1.5 hours and they didn‚Äôt bother to notify us until 50 minutes after our original departure time. Do not use Flixbus in the US, since they bought Greyhound, everything is delayed. The worker said that there are delays like this everyday since Flixbus bought Greyhound. You are only entitled to a refund if your is cancelled. If it‚Äôs more than two hours late you can get credit, less than two hours you get nothing. Who would want credit? I‚Äôll never use them again. | Application will not allow ticket to be downloaded to Apple wallet. Big convenience needs fixing ASAP. | I have had 4 different trips with this company and to different places and it always has a urine smell, I think they should clean the bathrooms before each trip and flush the bathroom tank | The app is fine. This bus line is absolute garbage. I booked a ride from the 22nd to the 26th of December and they changed my bus ticket to the 24th without any compensation. On my ride to Vegas from Los Angeles, the bus supposedly had no heat and the entire bus felt like an ice chest. I got sick. Then on my bus ride back, I went to the address in my email but we didn‚Äôt see anyone over there. After I called customer service about 3 times I finally got an answer and they told me that the actual stop was a little over 2 blocks away from where I was supposed to be. I would have made it to my bus had they given me the correct address. I asked to speak to a supervisor since I was given an incorrect address and there was no way for them to rebook me on to the next bus ride home. I basically had to buy a whole new ticket. I am a young woman and the area they had me waiting at was less than safe. Anything could have happened. Luckily my brother was able to take me back to my mother‚Äôs house but I missed important appointments back home because of the unprofessionalism I experienced with this company. Just use Greyhound instead. Had I not had family here, I would‚Äôve been in an even tougher spot, especially especially since I was 35 minutes away from where I was staying. I believe this bus line is a scam. Do NOT go through them especially if you‚Äôre a young woman traveling alone at night. | You wont be able to get your refund if you miss ur bus or if you decide to cancel it they will only give 50% voucher definitely a lose | Horrible company with zero ethics. Praying it‚Äôll be shut down forever. | The bus driver never showed up left multiple passengers without a ride an nowhere to go. 
Good luck getting ahold of someone because you won‚Äôt! 
Good luck getting a refund because you won‚Äôt. 
You‚Äôll have to file fraud charges with your bank. 
Worst company ever seen in my life there 30min early and they never showed up.  Disgusting. | every booking is a gamble. the likelihood of your ride being delayed/cancelled is extremely common. 

i have had one of my most recent trips delayed by 2 hrs. my most recent trip was just cancelled. the worst part about all this is that they don‚Äôt tell you until the scheduled bus time leaving little room for change of plans.

their customer service is extremely bad as well. irresponsible service as in person, they rid themselves of all responsibility and online, they simply cancel chat or hang up. the money lost is lost but never again. | All the passengers at New Orleans were waiting in the waiting area, and the bus left without even informing anyone.
The departure time was 11:55PM but the bus left at 11:40PM. I called customer support & there was no solution no refund, instead i got charged for international calling as there customer support number was of +49.
Utterly disappointed & will never use this bus service. | Not taking several payment methods | So apparently it‚Äôs my fault that I didn‚Äôt expect the bus to be delay by so long that I had thought I missed the bus entirely, I showed up 20 minutes early and the bus was never there. So on my way home I requested a refund and tried to buy a new ticket. The exact same thing happened twice in a row of the bus being delay yet again. I requested another refund for the SECOND TICKET mind you it‚Äôs costing me 50$ because it‚Äôs a round trip so I‚Äôve spent 100$ on this app. All for them to tell me that because the bus had left I wasn‚Äôt able to get a refund for either bus tickets I had payed for. Never again using something like this or taking a FlixBus ever again in my life. I don‚Äôt recommend anyone else use FlixBus because of this. | My bus got cancelled. Fine. FlixBus then took the liberty to switch my trip to a different trip without my consent that was cheaper that my original trip. I asked customer service to refund the difference and they refused. I then asked them to cancel and refund the booking that I literally didn‚Äôt book and they happily cancelled it but didn‚Äôt refund it. Thankfully I got a refund from my bank. Absolutely never again, if you need to go anywhere, use Amtrak. | Very convenient and on time | -Reserved Seat option is not honored while boarding 

-Problem accepting ANY payment option @ any given time

- Previously Reserved seats will remain unavailable on the App, even though all payment options have been declined .

-Customer Service & Chat Reps, are clueless. | The prices on the app are too expensive. The price of tickets bought early is twice as expensive as the price of tickets bought later. There is no fixed price? FLIXBUS is the worst app I have ever seen | Paid $30 to book a ride with this awful service, but had to cancel due to COVID, I was severely sick because of it. I couldn‚Äôt make my trip, so I had requested a refund. They gave me $4 out of the $30 that I paid for, that‚Äôs outrageous and unfair given the circumstances. Do not book with Flixbus, their refund policy is unfair and unethical due to human nature, some things are out of our control. Please update your refund policy Flixbus, I sure hope your greed will be resolved. | The bus stinks. They charge for choosing seats and ask you to sit anywhere. The seats are not at all comfortable. Overall had a terrible terrible experience. | I guess as they say, you get what you pay! Flix bus is the worst, always delayed, no information updating you in the delay, they make you waste your time and no way to officially complain or get a compensation. I had a trip to florence at 5:10am in the morning and they delayed it at 6:50am, how is that even possible. I‚Äôm never again traveling in this company. Don‚Äôt use it. Rather pay a little bit more, travel more comfortably and forget this trash company. | Easy but why a service fee? | Booked a greyhound bus ticket on Flix at 1:25am, told me there isn‚Äôt a seat and I‚Äôm not on the system, because their system over booked it, sent no ahead notification about it, calls customer service many times without response. | Had a bus ticket from Washington to NY. On the day of the departure arrived way ahead and the bus was not at the indicated location not anywhere around the area. This was probably on purpose since it was after Thanksgiving and I got my ticket way in advance with just 29 $ and now to even try and buy another ticket last minute it was 123$. They did not refund me, nor give me credit. Awful experience overall. There was no number of the driver not even a number to contact customer service - only via chat. Not using flix bus ever again! Ended going home on Best Bus - which by the way does not charge anything for choosing a seat on the bus - you can take a seat anywhere, and it was cheaper to get home: 60 $ instead of 123$ on Flix Bus for a last minute ticket. | No discount for first time riders | 2 cancelled reservations on their end and my $ hasn‚Äôt been reimbursed. | So, I planned a trip for me and my wife who is in a wheelchair. I normally take a competitor with very few issues and if there are, they fix them. I got an email saying that my bus ticket that I had ordered a week prior was cancelled because the bus going to my stop was not able to accommodate a wheelchair. So they rescheduled my bus. I ended up having to go to Philly instead. We get there and the driver tells us that the chairs that are pushed forward to make room for a wheelchair and that it would take too long to get a mechanic there to fix it. She could crawl up the large winding staircase though and store her electric wheelchair that weighs a ton in the baggage compartment. Obviously, this is not something that we are able to do since the wheelchair is too heavy to do that and we don‚Äôt want to have it be damaged since it‚Äôs rather expensive to replace. 

I contact FLIXBUS and the customer service is appalling. They outright tell me that ‚Äúyou are not entitled to a refund‚Äù for a bus where we literally could not get on. I send an email off and eventually get an email back apologizing for the whole thing. They said that they would refund my ticket as well as provide reimbursement for alternative transportation and lodging that we had to buy as a result of being denied entry on their bus. 

I submit a claim per their instructions and got back an email that said the only service eligible to be refunded (didn‚Äôt ask for a refund, asked for reimbursement of alternative transportation) was tickets from flixbus or greyhound. Which was not stated to me in that email. Alternative means alternative. Not flixbus. 

Basically, don‚Äôt ride Flixbus unless you would like to support a company that treats their disabled customers like crap and makes them jump through hoops that were pointless to jump through in the first place because they claim you didn‚Äôt meet the criteria they never set forth. 

Scum. | The drivers are always ready to help and the buses are clean and cozy ü´∂. | I booked a trip with @Flixbus using my credit card, and when I canceled it a few hours later they deducted around 40% of the price and returned the rest as a voucher. when I requested a refund on my bank account as I won't use @Flixbus again they refused. The worst customer satisfaction I have seen. | The app is fine, although they never send notifications through the app that your trip has been cancelled. Only through email. They have cancelled at least three trips of mine in the past 3 months and changed my arrival/departure time for others as well. Don‚Äôt book a trip in Arizona if you want your bus cancelled, incredibly inconvenient company. | I arrived to bus station, and did not find FlixBus, only ‚Äúgreyhound‚Äù. That is later more than 1 houses,
This is terrible, I will never use FLIXBus anymore | There‚Äôs an issue when you try to add your phone number to receive an sms message. When you enter in your phone number there‚Äôs an error. Each time you enter your phone number it adds an extra space making it hard for the system to accept your number.

This game has nothing got to do with its advertisement. Honestly, if this game would actually put its advertisement into escape, it actually might be more adorable. And yes, I would actually probably spread money but it doesn‚Äôt. This is a game build up get get screwed and yes pay money to get that screwed out of it. Trust me this is a money game. It is not what you think you know what maybe put your advertising game into the game then yes I would actually give you a hiya star because trust me, I‚Äôm not playing those stupid games that you have to offer | I would have given a 5 but the barn keeps on getting full really quick and I have to use a lot of my money as it grows | It is fun because I like it Jutrjygcjtfjhgcyjtdh | i played this game when i was around 6, almost 10 years ago. i just picked up the game yesterday and have been obsessed with it since. i absolutely love this game, although i can‚Äôt find my old iPad, i still have this phone to play on and i play everyday!! i love it so much. | Ok so when I first started playing this game I absolutely loved it. The crops only took about 10-15 to grow. Not including the wheat. So basically the game is your making your own town!! But when you get to upper levels of the game, like 10 and above, everything goes to slow motion. The community buildings now take about 12 hours! For someone who is COMPLETELY impatient this is not acceptable.  But I often leave it alone and sleep on it. (Not literally) And to build buildings you need to have supplies. Which often come from trains. And when I think about it, it only comes from trains. And you need EVEN MORE supplies to fill the trains! Like what? And then each time you send off the train the time increases for it to come back with supplies. I‚Äôm on level 14 and the most time it has taken is 1 hour and 10 mins. Once you have planted EVEN more crops, and you have set for your houses and community building to build, you food mill is working, the animals are eating, and your helicopters are off, and your train is off, ( which I know sounds like that would take a while, it really doesn‚Äôt) you have NOTHING to do. These things need to be fixed, but I‚Äôll still play the game. I would only recommend if you NEED to have something to do sometimes. Thanks! | I love this game so much because it‚Äôs so much fun and you never have extra time to play other games | This game is my hyper fixation right now and I love killing time playing it!! | False advertisement is a crime. Class A Misdemeanor to be technical. | I know stars and title is a contradiction but hear me out.  I have been playing the game for 8 years. In the beginning I really enjoyed and met some really nice people. I am sure you will like it to.

Just beware, here is my beef. Playrix has figured out a way to get you to spend more money than required for this game. The side games are at an impossible level to complete.  Example: how to you clear 30 piece of one object and 8 of another with only 12 moves. Therefore you Must use your Tcash to extend the moves to see if you can clear to the next level. This has happened several times.  Then you have the explosions next to the object to clear and they don‚Äôt thus wasting your moves to do something that should have been cleared. Not to mention it used to be 3 moves to pull up a treasure chest now it‚Äôs 4 moves and most of your lives so you will Never finish the side story. And the last one you are suppose to clear a certain color of 25 and it only drops 8 the entire time.

I know waiting this long to say something is on me but I thought it was a fluke and all others were giving positive feedback like I would have/was.  I thought it would not be to bad but with the past year or more it‚Äôs gotten worse. I don‚Äôt think it will go back to be an extremely enjoyable game. And it‚Äôs annoying that companies are squeezing every dime out of it users. I am the type if the game is good and doesn‚Äôt force you to purchase; I don‚Äôt mind buying extra to support the game. But with this type of tactics makes me want to be a less than casual player.

Shame on you Playrix. All I can ask is please be mindful and do better. | Like it but I‚Äôm 72 it‚Äôs a little confusing to me | I don‚Äôt know why but it‚Äôs sooo addicting and fun | Member of the park | something weird happened. I was trying to move things around my farm and then deleted some josie's cause i wanted to upgrade some to a duplex or something larger. I had just bought a candy shop and it was being built then i guess since i sold a house it went under the allowed # of residents so it deleted my candy shop!!! i thought it was gonna give it back or put it in storage or at least refund my coins but it never did so i have to save up for it all over again! i'm so annoyed cause i spent REAL MONEY on this game and it just took it and never gave it back. I was playing it everyday for months now. & now i kinda just annoyed me and got me feeling burnt out cause i really saved for that just for it to disappear 
 like nothing!! | I‚Äôve been playing this game for about a year or more and there are no ads. 

To the developers: Come on! Stop with the deceitful advertising! You know darn well your game is nothing like it is shown! Just make a new game app like that instead of lying! I can‚Äôt believe Apple tolerates deceitful advertising. | There is a review on here stating ‚Äúit can be better‚Äù and I 100% agree on it. Everything they described is spot on. 
Everything on here is very time consuming, straight off the bat. Building anything takes hours, the first day playing I had to wait 18 hrs for a building to finish. Your barn is always running out of storage and you can‚Äôt sell items on there because you need them. The mini games are fun until you reach level 50‚Äôs (which isn‚Äôt a lot btw) with only receiving 17 moves. Nearly impossible, but if you buy help then you pass it. 
This game was relaxing but I‚Äôm noticing how everything is taking alot of money and time just to get something done. | I‚Äôve spent a lot of money on this game over the past years.  A couple of specific observations.  1)you‚Äôll not be able to advance in certain parts of the game without spending $.  Progress can stall to a complete halt for weeks unless you‚Äôre willing to spend $$.  2)the amount of ‚Äúenergy‚Äù credits required to advance in several of supplement games is ridiculous.  Over 100 energy credits in a lot of areas.  Again, refer back to no 1 if you want to progress.  3) just today, I was cheated out of additional energy credits.  SUPPLEMENTAL Game show 10x reward.  After completing that specific level successfully only 2x energy credit was rewarded.  Cheating consumers is a big red flag for me.  Township supposedly has over a million players, so the game is obviously banking some serious cash, why cheat the customers who are playing. And yes i took a video to prove what I‚Äôve stated above. | this app is nothing like the ad that interrupted my plants vs zombies gameplay?? And i can‚Äôt even lie and say i didn‚Äôt enjoy it because that‚Äôs the reason i downloaded it but when i opened that app it went right back to not being on my phone because it was absolutely nothing like the ad. NOTHING. | Township is a better game than any game of them all. I love this game because you could do anything in the game that‚Äôs why you that‚Äôs why this skin is the funnest game ever. | It is relaxing to play and fun | i wanna give this app one star for this absolutely misleading and terrible mistake but i love this game so ill give it 4 stars | Cool | World funest game it made my kid sit for  3 hours i had a good night h sleep
And | ÂûÉÂúæÂûÉÂúæÂûÉÂúæ | You want with on the ad it‚Äôs not gonna be as fun as you think the real game is the ad is like not like other games. Just a horrible game why hate it it‚Äôs not a good game. I mean it‚Äôs good without the app expensive and then like it and all the stuff they have is. | The few opportunities for an African-American avatar in this game is the black doctor and a basketball player.  There should be other options available. If you‚Äôre playing this game as an African-American. I would appreciate more options to be made available. Thank you. | Have you ever heard about town ship? Well if you haven‚Äôt, then you should try it! It‚Äôs this really fun game where YOU have to run your town. You Should probably give it a shot. | I was very disappointed when i downloaded the app and its nothing like the ads!! | Although I downloaded this game to play selling and collecting eggs to customers like how they show in the ad, it‚Äôs really a farm building game. The ads are a scam. But I can‚Äôt lie, Im addicted to playing the game. It‚Äôs a really slow building process if you don‚Äôt want to spend actual money. | Hi! I love this game and all but I don‚Äôt really want the tutorial for the game. Do you know how to skip it? | This game is so much fun but there‚Äôs one thing you need to know it is nothing like the ads head over the town and you click on me and it does it for you. You just click on it every now and again when you need extra stuff sometimes like I got the game this morning and I have to had a time to play so I‚Äôve been playing for about a half an hour and I‚Äôve only gotten one thing of what the ad actually shows and I‚Äôm pretty sure it was just an ad so if you‚Äôre expecting it to be like the ad just know it‚Äôs only got a little bit of what the ad has. | This game is perfect for kids and my 5 year old son jack loves it! This game is perfect for the young ones. | It‚Äôs a nice game but it‚Äôs not always like the ads also it cheats you out of some things. Mainly on the puzzle games. I think they could have did better on that. Example, I was playing and it made me waste my stuff. But beyond that it‚Äôs fine. | Nothing like it was advertised. That would‚Äôve been a good game. This is nothing more than a money grab. | Ohio | This game often cheats to cause you to spend money. While I understand the algorithm is designed to do encourage spending. There are some features that don‚Äôt not function properly when you are near zero lives or playing well. Example the propellers are meant to hit the square that helps you accomplish a goal. There have been multiple occasions where they do not function correctly. Recently, I had 1 move left, 1 propeller, and 1 block to clear. Click the propeller and it hits a completely different square. Then to continue, ask for help of pay.
This is beyond frustrating. | Hi, my name is Ellie and I would like to have this game is it is a great game you can build stuff work together with friends if you after you restore the place and play co-op if you get to level 19 claim rewards rewards, help you build your village and if you like the building villages, this would be great for you and if you liked upgrading how big friend sending gifts for all of the above, it would be a great game for you I think it‚Äôs a good game because you have to start your own village. Make sure you have enough residents level up you could play or co-op after you get to level 19 and if you love games that you had to buy things work on something have games in the games this game would be great for you. | None of the graphics in this ad is actually in the game. | This game is a moneymaker for the developers. Every single things takes hours to complete but if you spend money you can speed up the gameplay one time. | I downloaded this for the quick paced upgrade game shown in every single advertisement. The game is nothing at all like the ads and that‚Äôs so frustrating. There are mini games occasionally like the adverts but most of the game is idle. | The Candy Crush-like mini game cheats by deliberately misinterpreting key strokes and always to the benefit of the game, never the player. 

Grind, grind, grind and get nothing but a headache and waste of time. 

Should be removed from the App Store. I thought the games had to pass some kind of quality test? This game surely fails. | So full disclosure; I play apps in bunches. When I‚Äôm busy, keeping up on the app games takes a back seat. But when I have time I play them a good bit. So when I DL‚Äôd Township, like most app games, I play a lot especially early to try and see what the game offers as I advance. 

The game itself is honestly pretty great. A lot going on, reasonable time constraints, and good progression speed with a ton of space on the map to keep growing. But I have one MAJOR issue that I almost guarantee will eventually get me off this game all together.

There are sporadic long term quests that take your character out of the town and into and almost board game like area where u search for specific items to crack a mystery / objective. That part is fine. But it depends on your success at what is basically an exact copy of Royal Match. Now I actually play 3 games on my phone and that‚Äôs arguably my favorite. Im very good at it. Now in that game I do think it purposely manipulates the pieces you get whenever u start to accumulate a lot of good supplies and coins. But even then I feel like there is a way to beat levels, u just need to make flawless decisions. On Township, that same game does NOT feel the same. I‚Äôm almost positive that you literally don‚Äôt have a path to victory many many times. The amount of turns you have to complete these levels is absurdddd. And don‚Äôt be lulled into a false sense of security because for the first goood handful of levels, I ran through with no issues at all. But trust me, when u reach a certain point, mind u this point took me maybe 2 days to reach, you constantly spend pointless time trying to beat complex levels in literally 10-12 moves. My advance; if they want to incentivize players to spend money then offer incentives we want. Don‚Äôt frustrate us with what is clearly a manipulated win-less game. But again, if u don‚Äôt mind wasting tons of time and turns to finally get lucky and beat some of these levels then the game itself really is fun with a ton of assets and tasks to do. | Ad is nothing like the game | The best part of this game is that there are no ads! If there were I wouldn‚Äôt play it! The worst part of the game is when you reach a certain level and have to stop expanding because suddenly you need ‚Äòextra tools‚Äô you didn‚Äôt need before ‚Äî and you have to wait for them to come slowly in on the trains... There‚Äôs just no sense in that; as time goes on there should be a way to speed things up ‚Äîand WHY do the construction workers go on strike literally EVERY TIME I build something‚Ä¶.?? I‚Äôve paid the obnoxious amount of coins for the structures I want, I‚Äôve waited the allotted time for them to be built ‚Äîand they‚Äôre still sitting there unusable while the workers swing their legs demanding extra supplies. This aspect, and just in general how unnecessarily long it takes to make the simplest of products ‚Äîand the fact I keep upgrading my barn and still somehow barely have room to store anything?? ‚Äîis hands down the least intriguing aspect of the game. Even w/o ads I probably won‚Äôt play it much longer bc it‚Äôs just annoying how long it takes to make any kind of progress now. Also, you can def tell that the mini games sometimes scare you over so you can‚Äôt progress as quickly as you want to. | I love this game | It‚Äôs literally impossible to do the puzzles without wasting 6 power-ups PER LEVEL. It‚Äôs literally insane I wasted 11 power-ups and still haven‚Äôt completed a level in over an hour. The puzzles are a joke | This is not what it is. It‚Äôs boring to me. I wouldn‚Äôt subject | this is the worst game: not like the ads, and I don‚Äôt really like it‚Ä¶
good! Good quality, though it‚Äôs not like the ads, it‚Äôs still kind of fun but also boring.. you‚Äôll get tired of it after a while. | this game is very

I called to cancel and they offered to refund me $7 of my $50 dollars saying the restaurant already started the food. It‚Äôs been 2 minutes since I placed the order!!!! Location tracking on the app is trash and ordered from the wrong store WOULD NOT RECOMMEND door dash only | I‚Äôve used the app a few times to order and I live in a rural area without many options. But between the majority of their drivers unable to follow a simple step by step instructions to get to my location or the even worse customer service when you report a problem I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs worse. I‚Äôm done with this garbage company and app already canceled the membership and deleted my account. | Takes my money when they can‚Äôt even find drivers to bring the food. I‚Äôve waited hours just to have my order canceled. Horrible service and then you have to fight for a refund. | I requested the driver call me when the food arrived.  They never called and they left me frozen food on the floor the hotel lobby.  Refused to give me a refund. | No explanation. Just canceled my order.  Where is my refund. | Follow my facebook page Everyday Civilian Defense USA and message me. If you can‚Äôt find it it‚Äôs because they are attacking the civilian public everywhere! | App would not allow me to adjust! | For the cost of fees and dues each month you would think they‚Äôd give you a discount every once and a while. Always offers but never to any place I‚Äôd order from. | The automated customer service is bad. I can‚Äôt tell them when every part of the order is screwed up. The customer service has greatly improved, but why list all of the closed restaurants? There are a few places in my small area that let you get all the way through ordering just to say that they won‚Äôt deliver to your area.

Update: the developers emailed me and sent me a dead link to contact them. Super helpful. | I have a screenshot of my unlovely chat with Demma about a driver who did not match the picture of who showed up at my house! After explaining that the driver showed up 2 hours late due to his extra trip to his crib or whomever my food will be cold! She suggested that I should cancel the order because I had doubts about the driver ability to drop off my food. I demanded for a manager and she said they aren‚Äôt available until the morning 8am. I had to wait on Sheena to unauthorize a full credit for piss poor service! And the prices are spiked high on this app. I dislike this food service. DoorDash is sooooooooo much better and cost efficient! Download DoorDash everyone! Avoid bad customer experiences with this poor app that spike prices to put in their pockets! Uninstalling!!!! | Have to wait 7-10 days for $5 fries that I never got. Awesome üôÉ | Good old Grubhub! One can find almost anything and everything in the way of tasty bites. Keep up the good work, Grubby, because I‚Äôve already deleted all the other food apps from my cellphone!

Thanks so much,

Christine T | Grub-hub, is very conducive for my needs | Was charged $6.99 for delivery even though delivery was stated as free. Would like a charge back on my $6.99! Thanks, Susan | I went to use Grubhub as a new customer and no matter what I did the new customer promo wouldn‚Äôt work. I got a huge run around from customer service doing everything in their lower to avoid giving me the advertised discount. After hours fighting with these imbeciles I went back to door dash. Two thumbs down never again!!! | Drivers just claim to deliver food and expect you to deal with it. Worst company on planet. | It takes months for them to get back to you I definitely recommend finding something else if you want fairness they came out our house half my food was gone looked like somebody had their hand in my food found hair balled up in my stuff and my bags was opened by the driver sick | This app is absolutely terrible, it sends your order to locations 2-3 miles away from you rather then the closest. My driver passed two different locations when bringing me my food. Why it didn‚Äôt send my order to the location a block away I will never understand. | Never have had a problem.
Always on time.
Drivers follow no contact instructions.
Good Service.
Grateful for the convenience.

My ONLY problem with ALL food delivery services is that the restaurant HAS NOT properly packaged their food, which will result in occasional spillage.
Not the service or drivers fault. | Live in NYC, last 5 order were all delayed by an hour. Unacceptable. | I gave it a one star rating. Because I never received any credit, money or food. The customer service team is trashy and rude and no help whatsoever | They hammer you with fees and take zero responsibility when your order arrives wrong, or not at all!  Never using them again.  Wouldn‚Äôt even refund me an order when it never arrived.  Their drivers get paid for stealing food. | Just took an order‚Ä¶right away I look for pickup times and drop off times‚Ä¶
They won‚Äôt let me post a pic‚Ä¶but it was already past due for deliver by 2 mins and I just received the offer‚Ä¶meaning they spent to much time trying to lowball others to take your run instead of offering it to the best option aka me‚Ä¶.making the order 25 mins overdue‚Ä¶think that over when your order is late‚Ä¶not drivers faultü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | If it‚Äôs a raining day‚Ä¶ you got me but I‚Äôm not pleased that a meal costing $18 can easily turn to $32 with fees and tip. I don‚Äôt mind tipping but DANGGG maybe I could tip better if the fees didn‚Äôt drain my daily budget. | Had a few issues in the ordering process. Entered CC number in the app but would only bill out through Apple Pay.  Haven‚Äôt experienced these issues through other delivery apps. All in all it‚Äôs ok. When you‚Äôre hungry and don‚Äôt want to get out, it gets food delivered to you. | My order was delayed 4 times, and then I had to cancel because the order never came. My driver avoided my house and took other orders and did not deliver my food. Grub hub did absolutely nothing to help the situation, and didn‚Äôt even contact the driver. They canceled the order and did nothing to help the hour and a half of my time they wasted. Terrible company. | Great service. Thank you GrubHub!  As a single city dweller with no car, I rely on food delivery. Grub hub has kept me fed well. Seems to treat restaurants well. | Not sure why I‚Äôm not refunded delivery fees when items aren‚Äôt delivered. Makes no sense that I‚Äôm not refunded when the delivery service doesn‚Äôt happen. | Is good | In the last few weeks, GH delivery people have left my food outside the building, in the building foyer to be taken or grow cold, or just not delivered. Most recently, Customer Service refused to credit or refund the order, even with the driver‚Äôs own photo and our building door video. I don‚Äôt mind paying a premium for this type of service, but when the service fails to deliver, literally, why am I expected to pay? | Grubhub+ has terrible customer service. I had a payment issue and they chose not to help, pretending there was nothing they could do. A company who offers such a large array of options should have better customer service than an empty apology and not doing anything. | Terrible customer service they are beyond rude when you have a problem with your order they act like they can‚Äôt fix it . | Listen, I get that you have to charge a little extra to keep the lights on, but when I make a $32 order and an additional 1/3 of that price is added to the bill for fees that aren‚Äôt attributed to anything related to running the app, or the company?  That‚Äôs highway robbery. And that‚Äôs not even counting sales tax and tip to the driver. When all is said and done it ends up being close to twice the original price. No thanks! | They take your money instantaneously, even when the restaurants are closed but take forever to refund you and to update you on the status and they will make you wait hours before telling you your food is not coming

Happened multiple times. But these fukbois are the only game in town so they can rip off both the customer and restaurants. The cancerous middle man. I spit | The driver calls me about the delivery when I left specific instructions: Leave at Front Desk.
I opened my order and nothing in this order belongs to me.!!!‚Äô
I normally use DoorDash now I know why! | Tips should be calculated on the purchased items, but the site also includes the delivery and service fees in the basis amount for tips. | I use both Uber Eats and more recently Grubhub. What I found his Uber Eats is very consistent in its ability to deliver food and GrubHub is consistently not able to do the same. I have had two orders that have had to be canceled because the food was ready at the restaurant, and the drivers were not available to pick it up, I canceled my Grubhub+ subscription and will go back to Uber Eats exclusively. customer service at GrubHub is awful. Representatives on the other side of the chat are only using scripts for responses. There is no personalization and no empathy. | Use to like it during 2020-2022 era but now- wow. It‚Äôs bad. Last 5 meals were between 20 minutes late and 90 minutes late. The worst was one where I did an advanced order 2 hours ahead of time as I was working late. I went to cancel right after as a colleague offered to grab food. Cue me contacting the  company trying to cancel. They claimed the restaurant already started cooking. Really? You had them start my burger and fries 2 hours ahead of time? Fine. I‚Äôm stuck. So did it arrive at 7pm at planned? No. They came at 7:30pm. Fine. Was it at the front desk for my small company? Nope. We found it later. They left it right next to the trash can over hanging the floor below on the railing including the drink, and about 5‚Äô from the bathrooms. This was about 50 feet outside of my office in the outside building. Yet it was marked completed. And they never called or texted but gladly took my 30% tip. | My order has not been correct in a year. The driver either steals my food or I s never my order. I‚Äôm on the phone with grub hub frequently. They have wondered staff and customer service. But my order is never core t as in missing half of what I order! Please talk to your drivers . You may have some bad people working for you selling others food orders in the side. | Staff here are kind and friendly.  They greet yon by your and and even write special notes in your food boxes.  It makes me feel special.  They are amazing.  Order from them. | They always deliver on time I am very pleased with the service! | While the app experience is ‚Äòokay‚Äô, it‚Äôs the business behind it all that is horrible. Grubhub+ is a joke, I can get the same price on every other service but GH+ just subtracts the delivery fee and hides it in ‚Äòservice fee‚Äô that they don‚Äôt show you until you check out. 
Also, it‚Äôs the only service that consistently delivers my food cold because they tell their drivers to pick up multiple orders on the way. You‚Äôd think with + that you would actually get some sort of benefit, like warm food. If I didn‚Äôt get monthly coupons from my work, I‚Äôd never use this service because of how consistently bad the experience is. | The title says it all.
It‚Äôs better than eating from a dumpster, but I‚Äôd rather not have a heart-attack either. | Even with my Dad in assisted living and with us working out of town when he needed a double cheeseburger he got one thank you all for the great service | You need to add a field for a note to the person preparing the food. | In the beginning!

Satisfecha con el servicio | App insists on having access to your complete calendar (‚ÄúFull Access‚Äù permission) to add your booked flight to your calendar, when ‚ÄúAdd Events Only‚Äù is all that should really be required. | I like to know wha kind of aircraft I will be flying in and can‚Äôt seem to find anywhere in booking process. | Dope | Can barely read the site. Very difficult to understand charges | There is a new feature with in flight shopping; to get the right inflight shopping magazine I need to check my flight number; the app gives exemples; now I am sure of my flight number.

Problem is that from there I need to ""guess"" one of 3 flags; ch, uk or eu. Problem is I have a ch-eu flight... what flag should I check ?

I'll buy inflight ... another time. 

In reality inflight should as for my flight number and ""automatically"" open the currect inflight magazine. | I don‚Äôt think they should even get a star. On the way to London everything was fine but on the way back they were rude to everyone on a half full plane. I had to throw away some clothes and a pair of nice shoes just so my bag would fit the small baggage. Also their first class is not a thing really there is absolutely no leg room on the entire plane. I will definitely not fly this EVER again. | I have my flight cancelled for one day, when I check in afterwards my seat he‚Äôs changed. I payed best seat F1 and now you put me one 12B.
Also I‚Äôm waiting for 2 hours to your desk for getting hotel room.
This is not correct at all. | They changed the gate at the last minute to a different terminal

They did not update the app
They did not make an announcement 
They did not have a representative come by

Had I not checked the board then we would have missed our flight.  

Do not trust their app and do not trust this airline. | There are different prices to buy the same baggage allowance depending on where you are in the booking procedure. The further along you are in the ticket purchase the cheaper it is to check the bag | They took my money and gave me nothing. Not worth it. | the worst app ever! 

Online they redirect to the app! Once you get to the app and enter the exact same information they‚Äôre unable to track your flight and there‚Äôs no way to fill in the information online! | From checked-in page that said download boarding pass to repeated inability to find my trips to strange instruction in confirmation email to go to Go to Gate to check in that had no option for checking in to confusing array of different numbers, it took me nearly half an hour to use this app | If there is a situation, while other airlines can fly. They just choose the easiest way for themselves and decline your compensation request. Avoid this airline if possible. | You get what you pay for, oh wait, you don‚Äôt even get that. Paid for a flight with one layover, flight delayed, couldn‚Äôt make our connection and they wouldn‚Äôt put us on the next flight, or any flight to our final destination without buying another ticket. What a bunch of crap | Bought two tickets at 137 each, but then add standard plus for 59.99, then supposed free seat selection. But later cost breakdown charged me 49,99 | Early to the gate by 3hrs and never heard an announcement for Catantia or our names.  Perhaps a audio system issue, but the ladies on duty were less than helpful to get us rebooked, full of negative attitude, and soured our love of Italy.  Unfortunate on our part to miss the flight somehow, but inhospitable for EasyJet to not try and assist us with a good resolution. | They canceled my flight and have no substitution for another flight. Do not book with this company. | Make sure if you face a problem with your booking , you will me get any help from them . | Paid six bucks for this and they don‚Äôt have United States or Philippines not one airport | Was trying to check out and make the payment and I was redirected to my bank to confirm and even though I authorized the payment, twice I got an error message that the payment was not authorized by the bank when returning to the app. | The queue to check a bag is ridiculously long and slow. We checked in online but have to wait in the check in queue to get a bag tag. | Just let me download to wallet | Son impuntuales, llaman para la salida y las salas de pre embarque no son suficientes para que entren todos los pasajeros, el servicio al cliente es mala, el abordaje al avi√≥n se hace sin ning√∫n criterio. Espero que esta sea la √∫ltima vez que tenga que viajar en esta p√©sima linea | Could not edit bags | I don‚Äôt understand why it would ask me to pay for luggages again when it‚Äôs already included in Flexi fare. Unless, this is a way they get extra money by tricking their customers. That‚Äôs kind of shady. They need to fix their online system. | Super simple self explanatory intuitive-excellent!! | The pricing add ons can be a bit confusing. You really have to read and be careful with the selections | Doesn‚Äôt work this f app | I am pleasantly impressed with how easy and fast to complete the checkin process on the App !!   Admittedly, I was a bit of resisting on using the app , however realizing that there is no way to print a boarding pass, I resorted to the app without any choice. Yet, it was a great experience ! | Paid for cabin bag -wouldn‚Äôt continue check in. Took money from credit card | For this first timer, I considered this app one others should offer. | Easy to go back n fort thru the website .
Wish there miles reward membership are free -
Can they offer a free to join your miles club ? | Could not enter dates or passport.  Had to go to website | Booking via the EASYJET App is very easy, booking via website or via a 3rd party like Priceline or Kayak is not! | Layout is nice and ux is aesthetically appealing, but it would not work multiple times when I tried to check in. The app even said I completed the check-in process, but every time, a pop-up message would appear saying there was an error and check-in could not be completed. Which was certainly true since I could not download my boarding pass. This happened several times. Hopefully the non-functionality of the app is not an indication of how the flight I‚Äôm about to get on will go‚Ä¶ | I don‚Äôt want your app, honestly how hard is that to understand | This site is so difficult to navigate. I have tried on a number of flights to pay for luggage before arriving at the airport. It is impossible to do that on this app. | Terrible user experience, confusing and prone to errors! Ryanair is so much better (app-wise) | Couldnt check in during the allotted time | I have speedy boarding on my reservation, one day the app boarding passes showed it correctly. When I arrived at the airport the next day it did not show speedy boarding on my boarding pass. When I logged into the website it show correctly on the boarding pass my speedy boarding. Be careful, you could wait in a long line for nothing. | Too many clicks to get to the important info
Doesn‚Äôt automatically link trips to your account once booked online
Boarding pass should be one click | Absolutely worst airlines I‚Äôve ever encountered. Flight from Lisbon to London was originally delayed 1hr but then suddenly was told to bored. Then it stopped and there was NO ONE providing updates as to why or what was happened. 2hrs later, we find out that the plane was delayed because the pilot crew ‚Äúdid not have necessary accommodations for a meal so they had to get off the plane, go to the terminal and eat lunch‚Äù. This was verbatim from the pilot.

What an ABSOLUTELY horrible experience! Completely ruined the rest of my vacation as I arrived nearly 4hrs late!! | This app is not easy to use. There is no contact info for this airline! Your robot doesn‚Äôt answer the questions asked. Finding where and how to upload the ticket to the app is confusing. You have way too much advertising and bait & switch policies. Overall I have to say customer service doesn‚Äôt exist with you. | Not very user-friendly, just took me an hour and a half just to check inüôÅ | The booking choices are very complicated.  No matter which choice I selected I couldn‚Äôt get the right combination of seats and baggage allowance I wanted.  Very very frustrating!!! | Difficult - not intuitive for me | Estou sempre com a conta bloqueada‚Ä¶. E sempres redefinir passwords 
√â horr√≠vel | Super easy to use. You can load your card. | Since Jan 2023 easyJet is no longer offsetting it‚Äôs aviation fuel emissions for its customers. It claims on its sustainability web page that a voluntary option will be available‚Ä¶ but two weeks in there is still no carbon offsets option in the booming flow that would show the emissions for the given flight and allow to add an offset payment as per of the reservation. This shows just how serious the airline actually is about emissions. More greenwashing from big orange.

Help !!! | Hoping we use it | Every time I get out of it to check something it resets to start page. The start page is cluttered. You can‚Äôt get your booking to make changes. | Your cite is difficult to maneuver! | I really like the AARP app however it is very frustrating to use. In this day and age it‚Äôs ridiculous that this app seems to be stuck in the past. Older people are way more tech savvy now. Please catch up to us. In no particular order here are the things I have found so far that have created this frustration. For reference purposes, I have the iPhone 15 pro max. So it‚Äôs a new phone using an outdated app. 

1. If you turn the phone to landscape mode, either whatever you were reading freezes or it returns to the app home screen. 

2. Same with playing a game.  If you turn the phone you have to restart whatever game you were playing.

3. If the phone goes in sleep mode, you have to restart the whole process of going to that game again. 

4. Some games just don‚Äôt work at all. They open but you can‚Äôt play them.
 
5. Even when reading an article, if your phone goes into sleep mode while reading, when you wake the phone, the app goes back to the home screen and you have to find the article again. 

5. Why can‚Äôt we save an article to read later? I literally have to send an article to myself via email so that I can read it another time.

6. When anything is open, the word ‚ÄúDone‚Äù appears at the top left of my phone. Please get rid of this and just put a back arrow so we can choose to just stay on this page and go back to the Home Screen ourselves. 

7. I have not used this app yet on my iPad, but from what I‚Äôve read in other reviews that is also a nightmare experience. I use my phone for the most part. But if this is the case, please, please have your app designer fix these flaws. This app shouldn‚Äôt be so frustrating to use.

Let‚Äôs see if they actually respond and do something about this or just send a canned response and do nothing. This is what appears to happen when reading older reviews complaining of these very same issues I have just written about. Reviews that are 3 and 4 years old stating the same issues. 

Please fix these issues. You would have a great app if you do. | This useful app works very well on the iPhone. However it just doesn‚Äôt cut on a iPad. As more and more seniors gravitate to the iPad as their primary internet device, this app needs to be customized accordingly. It is not helpful to stare at an iPhone rectangle inside an iPad screen. Thank you, AARP! | It‚Äôs a learning process. Stil adjusting! | All you get is a black screen. Worthless now! | * Search for articles
* Ability to bookmark articles
* Return to where you were if you switch out of the app and come back to it. 

Frustrating it doesn‚Äôt have these basic features. Would give it five stars if it had these features. | Great Resource App | Im still discovering all the benefits of my membership that seems designed for my specific tastes and needs. | I work on a computer everyday in my job and this mobile app is not user friendly. | I just love the benefits AARP offers. | Very Good | I like reading about the articles published by AARP because it's legit and not hearsay compared to other establishment. Keep up the good work. | Not able to schedule  an appointment to have my taxes done.
I have tried but the page looks as if aarp app is not stable. I‚Äôve used the app before had know problem. | I hope you always do these articles 
All so interesting -my hope is that I can always get to read them even after a month or so sometimes in that day I haven‚Äôt alwsys the time like to go back 
Thankyou | AARP may have lots of benefits but they slam you with ads so much it‚Äôs overwhelming. The app also constantly tells me my password is wrong (which it isn‚Äôt) and locks me out of my account. It‚Äôs very frustrating. | For over a week I can not load games.  Only get a blank screen.  What‚Äôs going on? | Every thing you ever said came true ! Thank you | Whether you need advice on insurance, health, finances, travel, AARP have many resources. | I played games for a very long time and now it is impossible to find them easily. I know you want me to look at the other stuff but IDO NOT WANT TO. I WANT TO PLAY My GAMES WHILE MY HUSBAND WATCHES FOOTBALL, COPS AND CAR SHOWS.  I am finished w AARP. | It‚Äôs very informative.I just pay service I had no idea it had this much information.I am amazed with what I learned just today. | Love this membership.  Lots of help and discounts
Whats not to love | Accessible and reliable. | Enjoy the words of encouragement that I get here. And the reminders to enjoy the life that I do have. Getting older is privilege and it‚Äôs nice on this app to be able to view so many different opportunities and ways to even enjoy life more. | I love this !!! | Should you leave the app for any reason or your phone just locks from time away, you can‚Äôt get back to the article you were reading. If the article is not currently on their front page you cannot search for it to return. Should you swipe oddly left or right the same thing occurs and you can‚Äôt get back to the article. Frustrating! | AARP is the best for saving especially at the age when you need it mostly.thank you | I love the discounts üòÉ | I try to take advantage of as many AARP benefits as I can .  They help me a lot in my ‚Äúold age‚Äù. Thank you AARP! | Thank you AARP for being Here For Us folks 55 and older. 
You provide the American aging public with much needed and wanted information. 
The beauty of AARP is that it is plenty of business and plenty of pleasure
I feel very much kept in the loop of information. 

Many thanks from a grateful member!

Thank you! | Like it | First of all a good number of people who use your app wear glasses to read, yet there‚Äôs  a ton of stuff written so small and against a background we can‚Äôt see.  I love the games in the app but I‚Äôm sick of you guys messing around that section so we can‚Äôt find the game at all or it takes 10 minutes to locate.

Not once! | This app crashes every time you search. If you successfully see search results, just hold on, it‚Äôs gonna crash as soon as you try to select anything. | The app worked for at first use. I went back to book after figuring plans. Now the app keeps crashing/automatically shutting down. I restarted my phone. I deleted and reinstalled the app. Still doing it. | My trips never show up, I can book a trip and it still will not show up. Have to go through my email. This is a bad glitch that has not been fixed in years. | DO NOT USE TO FIND SUITES. I booked a ‚ÄòHot Rate‚Äô suites only hotel and was given the total opposite.  It was bad enough that I got a refund, but still stranded at 9pm trying to find a hotel to accommodate my family. GOOD LUCK!! | I‚Äôve used the app for years without difficulty until today. Booked a ‚Äúhot rate‚Äù that advertised I‚Äôd get either Best Western or Wingate by Wyndham. After booking, it was revealed I got Studio 6 - basically a nicer Motel 6, but not at all what I‚Äôd consider equivalent to the two that were advertised. The customer service chat offered to try and cancel through the hotel, which the hotel of course refused to do. Hotwire then said they could still cancel and give me a Hotwire credit to re-book in the future, minus a $20 cancellation fee. So basically, they did a bait and switch and then expected me to continue to do business w/ them. Lesson learned. Will choose a competitor or book directly through a hotel from now on. | If I book it never shows my reservations in upcoming trips, rarely send me a confirmation email. Very disappointing | I was trying to found an hotel, but I can‚Äôt.  It closed.
Poor quality app | I have being using Hotwire for almost 10 year. They have the best prices for cars and hotel. Thank you Hotwire for always taking care for me and my family. Gracias | Useless. How about an update to fix it? | This app crashes nearly everytime I search for a hotel. | Currently searching around Sacramento area and app crashes. Can‚Äôt search without crash. | IDK ü§∑üèΩ it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve checked for updates but nothing. When I attempted to book thru the app it force closes and I‚Äôve tried over and over again. | They reserve the discounts for the app but the app is so buggy that if you enter a certain state and it crashes, it will never complete a search successfully again without crashing unless you completely delete it and reinstall it. 

Your reservation history also disappears randomly and only reappears when you log out and log back in. Ridiculous. Fix your app! | I book hotels with Hotwire several times a year, and have no complaints about the service. Their app, however, is missing functionality and unreliable. Search times are longer than the competition. It doesn‚Äôt save recent searches, so I have to re-enter location and dates each time. Some of the hotels turn out to be unavailable after tapping on the listing. The app freezes up or crashes regularly. The map drawing function kicks in when I accidentally touch the screen. | I‚Äôve used Hotwire for years, but the current version for iPhone doesn‚Äôt give flight options and when I try to book rental cars it allows me to enter my info. And when I hit ‚Äúsearch for cars ‚Äú it goes into outer space and app disappears. | Used to work fine, now it just freezes when I search for a hotel. And I have to force quite | The app seems to online work when booking a car. Anytime you try to look up hotels it closes the app. I tried deleting the application and redownloading it but it still failed. | Bad customer service, tried to beat customer, taking so long for the problem.
 Priceline do better | I used to only use Hotwire deals for trips out of town. But unfortunately, now I cannot search hotels without the app crashing every single time I try to search. Please fix this so I can get using the amazing deals again please!!!!!! Hotwire offers some phenomenal deals on hotel rooms but they are useless to me since the app will not work at all. | I have appreciated the great deals offered by Hotwire, but the app now consistently crashes whenever users perform a search. It‚Äôs incredibly annoying and causes people to delete reinstall the app. I would love for the app Team to fix this. It is causing people to disregard Hotwire and seek deals via other amazing platforms. I love the deals, but abhor the technology. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where it‚Äôs not worth the hassle. Hope that attention is given to this report. Thanks! | Yes | I have noticed strangeness on this app for a while. Getting the same lousy hotel on hot rates!!! Showing up and not having the reservation in the system their doing the hot rate and getting the same hotel.   This last time was totally egregious I saw a hotrate and paid for it and got the same hotel that had NONE OF the amenities I claimed.  I called and the agent barely spoke the language of the country I booked in. He was belligerent and mean. I told him i needed a different hotel and he kept mumbling under his breath same price. This is not how hot rate is supposed to work so when he comes back he gives me a hotel i have never heard of or his English is that bad that I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. He then asks for 300 dollars more I said thats not how that‚Äôs worked in the past you are supposed to give me a comparable hotel in the same area at the same rate. He says that‚Äôs howit works now. So i say lets try a different area. There are hotels I don‚Äôt want to stay in and those I will so there is a basic hot rate and a hit rate. So i say oh look at these in this neighborhood lets try this he says you will get one of these hot rate hotels and explains one I always get so Im ike okay. He gives me a basic hot rate. Im like oh no. He starts fussing with me and refuses to do anything. I wait for a supervisor and as Im waiting for the supervisor im watching the app and see this hotel which never appeared appear on the app as a hotrate. Im like what are they doing. Even so I realize that i have made the mistake of attacking a different location and this location has some okay reviews. So i tell the supervisor it‚Äôs okay. Well i drove over there and the sic three star hotel looks like the ghetto. There is trash on the ground. There are people loitering outside the hotel. It‚Äôs awful and I paid for fifteen days. I have contacted their through twitter since there is a very huge language barrier but they are slow to respond. Honestly I would think twice before using this app and i will never use it again. I am a former priceline user and when the consistently gave me Kimpton hotels which are nasty and gave me a so called five star that had dirty carpet and throwup everywhere behind the burger king. I stopped using them they did give me my money back immediately but Hotwire states up to two weeks for a refund i pay for fifteen and thirty days i need an immediate refund not a two week refund. They took my money and put me in the ghetto. Think Twice Before Using This Site. | App worked very well. And good deals! | Booked a hotel room, got confirmation and they took my money. Noticed it wasn‚Äôt showing in the app under my trips. I contact them and they double check. They say nope everything is fine you‚Äôre good to go. I had a gut feeling something was off. I checked my hotel confirmation number and it didn‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶ hmm weird. I chat again and they had issues and wanted to book another hotel. They tried to book me an hour away from where I needed to be staying stating there was high demand in the are. I ask for a refund and find the same room I booked through Hotwire on the actual hotels website and paid LESS than I did with Hotwire. This is now the 3rd issue I‚Äôve had and will NEVER use Hotwire again. It‚Äôs just not worth the headache. | Easy to navigate UI, straight forward uncomplicated booking process, slightly cheaper deals found on App versus online, mostly docking the 1.5 stars because we booked a trip a couple days ago thru the App yet the trip itself still doesn‚Äôt show up under ‚ÄúMy Trips‚Äù, just gets stuck on ‚ÄúGetting your trip summaries..‚Äù loading page. Not the biggest issue as I can still view the trip online but still a strange bug to have. | They will charge you extra once you go to check out | Badddd!!!!! If you want a hotel, they hide the pictures and the title of the hotel, the caption says, ""the identity of the hotel is hidden until after you book it"". | This is the third time I have booked a room through Hotwire, only to arrive at my hotel and them have no record of my reservation. Customer service on average has taken over 4 hours to resolve the issue each time. Completely unacceptable- this will be the last time I will use Hotwire as a booking service. | Please please please update app, everytime I get on it crashes. | Hotwire is my go to site for hotels, hands down. Don‚Äôt be fooled by sites like kayak telling you they search every hotel for the best deals. These deals are secret until you buy so they are ALWAYS lower than anything Kayak can find. | I use the app and book rooms and cars regularly. I‚Äôm sure they exist, but I have never had a bad experience and consistently best prices I can find. | This site is definitely not what it used be. On the surface the ‚Äúhot rates‚Äù appear to be much cheaper than the actual hotel rates. The problem when you look deeper is the taxes and fees on the ‚Äúhot rate‚Äù rooms are much higher negating any real discount. | Booked a hotel went to the hotel hotel doesn‚Äôt have any reservation in their system called to get support after an hour of being on hold was told that there was an error on their system and unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt allowing them to submit reservations to that hotel only offered to go to one star hotel after I booked a four star hotel after being put on hold for an hour. Which was also in another city by the way. Asked to speak to a supervisor which I then was put back on hold for another 30mins after just hanging up and reaching out to someone via chat!!!! Never again save your money | Hey human beings is what we are or are we human doings?

IDK about you but it is safe to say that we all got to get our hands and knee‚Äôs dirty slide around to Homebase then : What‚Äôs that!!! Penalty on the play due to me getting it in or out? 

You know what I mean by this? 

Whatever happens next year will be different and better than the last one so moving on is not the same as letting go!

I believe as we all understand it‚Äôs destiny a of developmental stages in our life and all.

How do you think we can get better at sorting out the issues behind what is happening in the world right now and then find ways to better manage it all to make positive impact on the future.

Turning around your life now is best way forward and I believe that you can do and you will be glad that you reached the point of my topic and feeling better off as an active member of human-beings existence vs wished a wish for those of ya‚Äôll shamelessly ugly human-doing‚Äôs/// Doing the most, Basically!

The only downside was that the connection to the local service provider wasn‚Äôt always active in the remote areas, but I had the flexibility of accessing different local service providers depending on signal strength.

I would definitely consider Airalo as my first option vs local SIM card. | They only have a chat function for support. Their instructions don't match current iphones so menus that they reference don't exist. They are unable to solve or troubleshoot problems. Nothing can be done in real time. If you are looking for reliable data in a foreign country, you'll be sorry if you use them. | Spent a week in Ireland, got it working the second I landed and the coverage was great. 3gb was more than enough for some light use to contact family and friends back home! Cheap and easy to use! | I used this eSIM twice and it worked flawlessly both times. It was easy to set up from home when I purchased a package and easy to activate when my plane landed. | When I first started using Airalo the customer service was amazing; representatives were quick to respond and kind and helpful when they did. Today alone (not the first time) I waited for 2 hours to get a customer rep on the chat, and the problem still took another 2 hours before it was resolved, the bulk of which was just waiting for a response in the chat. | As a senior I was a little nervous about using the service. But it was installed easily, and worked great in the UK, and Greece. Also used in Brazil. I cancelled my trip to Portugal and now stuck with one country eSIM. From now on I try to get regional sims, which are more convenient. | Great app. Easy to get going with clear instructions for setup and install. New to the eSIM world but after watching their video the setup was straightforward and I able to use it on my iPhone 13 first attempt. üëç | This service worked great for getting data in Japan. Totally painless experience. I think the only gotcha is that you need an unlocked phone, as many in the US arent. | I‚Äôm currently using Airalo in Spain and haven‚Äôt had a connection problem. Using a physical SIM card, I find is awkward and the instructions don‚Äôt always translate well. Airalo needs to improve its instruction video; that the only drawback I had as a first time user.
Airalo reached out and addressed my concerns. Updating to 5 stars. | This makes it so easy to get data just about anywhere in the world, and prices are pretty comparable to getting a local sim. Goodbye to physical sims forever. | I loved how easy it was to install and use on my phone. I ran out of data and bought a new plan and it automatically connected once my old plan ended. I liked the convenience of just installing it on my phone and not have to physically carry a hot spot device or have to put a chip in my phone. Would totally buy again  and I recommend for users traveling internationally! | N√£o baixa imagens, n√£o abre Instagram e outras redes, apenas WhatsApp e troca de mensagens sem possibilidade de efectuar chamadas . | Œó Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±œÉŒØŒ± Œ±œÜœåœÑŒøœÖ Œ±Œ≥ŒøœÅŒ¨œÉŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ e-sim Œ¥Œ∑ŒªŒ±Œ¥ŒÆ œåœÑŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµŒ≥Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ±œÑŒµŒØœÇ  ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ œÄŒµœÅŒØœÄŒªŒøŒ∫Œ∑ | I bought an esim for my trip to Ireland and it worked very well (spotty data in some mountain areas) Will definitely buy it again the next time I travel | It was horrible! Difficult to activate it.
It was deactivating and reconnecting by itself .
I had problems in Barcelona and Madrid to use it .
I bought twice and was only able to use it once .
Now I came back with 5GB unused . 
It will be expired soon and can‚Äôt use it again. Stay away from this e sim. | I had spotty internet and no text. Downloading app was a nightmare. What kind of app requires that you go back and forth from your phone to 4 pdf pages on how to download, and then wants you to email a Q R code to someone elses‚Äôs phone so you can scan the code off that phone??? Ridiculous. They had no trouble taking my money and credit card info. I am really uncomfortable about being connected to this sketchy person or organization. | Great for traveling and when at home when you run out of data. | Although we were able to use our eSIM in UK,
To date the two week package we purchased to use in Spain has been totally nonfunctional!
Paid for nothing. Cannot text, call or use date.
Leaves us in a huge bind!!! | Very happy with the purchase, will use it again in future travels. | scam scam! Beware. I got debited for no reason and after canceling the subscription i still get debited for what i dont even use. This is the height. I talked to a customer agent, they said they would refund my money in a month, i did the get a refund instead i got debited after 1 month again. This is very annoying i dont want your service i want my refund üò° | I have had this eSIM since last Thursday and it isn‚Äôt working. Everything appears to be properly installed. | I always seem to have issues with the service and it works when it wants. I can never have consistent service | Excelente servicio, nunca estuve desconectada. | I travel a lot for my occupation and it's always been a hassle getting access to reliable mobile data without spending hundreds on international plans from other providers. And then once I discovered eSIMs, it was almost just as annoying to arrive at the airport and wait just so I could have a stupid little activation code sent to me after I purchased the eSIM 1-2 hours ago. This app solves both issues. Affordable data, easy to obtain activation codes, and a huge variety of supported countries/regions. Seriously, I don't know why more people who have to ball on a budget but travel a lot for work or vacation don't know about this. | Paid for app for Southeast Asia in USA. Downloaded when I arrived in Bangkok. 
Followed all directions. It is successfully installed but I can‚Äôt get it to show up on my settings.  Have tried what‚Äôs app and within the airalo app to get support but no word from either. | eSIM did not work, charged $26 and won‚Äôt activate. | For real, legit. | Easy to natal and affordable for a worldwide trip! | Bought the eSIM for Denmark and had issues with the initial connecting of the eSIM to where nothing was being found and no service was ‚Äúactivating‚Äù. Figured it was user error and bit the bullet by uninstalling the eSIM, paying for ANOTHER one and it worked fine‚Ä¶at first. My phone died and after restarting, i once again could NOT reconnect. In total i used 72MB of data but paid for 40GB across both purchases. I will be disputing the charges for paying for a service i did not receive. | I keep getting a ‚ÄúConnection Error‚Äù after signing up and trying to ‚ÄúVerify Identity.‚Äù  Come on, what‚Äôs up with this app??? | Paid for 3 lines and was unable to use data. Customer support is nonexistent. Garbage company. | The prices are reasonable compared to US international plans and activation is straightforward. I had no issues adding the e-sim before my trip then activating when I landed. Works well China and could use all my Google apps. | Best decision I ever made while traveling no more hassles and piece of mind. | Has saved me many times while travelling | I was able to install the app & eSIM in the US. As soon as the jet touched down in Thailand I turned off Airplane Mode and there was my data! There were step-by-step instructions for installation & activation which made it so easy. This saves me so much time & hassle from having to purchase a physical SIM card when I get to a foreign country. Thank you Airalo! | Maria Magaldi | Lleva m√°s de 2dias en el periodo de verificaci√≥n‚Ä¶ en Espa√±a funcion√≥ bien | I love the service and products and becoming the regular customer. 

I really love the promotion program and referral process here. 

I just wanna see more high speed internet all over with more reasonable prices | We are traveling the world and my friend showed me this app when we visited her in the Philippines.
I have used it twice so far and have had no problems. (Except for a tweak or two in the settings). 
Also know you can get eSIMs for regions not just separate countries.
I‚Äôm telling all my travel buddies about it. | I bought this eSIM to use on my 5-day trip to Miami.  The app came highly recommended from a friend. Set up was flawless.  Now I live in the British Virgin Islands  and have to travel to nearby US Virgin Islands for US mainland trips. So, it‚Äôs crucial for me to stay connected with my family. Once I lost BVI cellular connection, I immediately switched over. Voila! No issues the entire trip! Great data coverage too! I shared the app with my daughter and, yeah, she‚Äôs happy too. Keep up the good work! | It works perfectly. Love to use it while traveling. Thank you | Very easy process to install. Using this as a 2nd eSIM on an iPhone 13 mini. It‚Äôs keeping me connected when away from WiFi while on an extended trip to Ecuador. I switch back and forth between the two (WiFi & Airalo). The app is great to monitor data usage and the other stats. Way cheaper than paying roaming fees from my provider. Best $ I‚Äôve spent! I‚Äôve already recommended this to all of my family and friends if they travel abroad! | Not a good coverage, eSIM is not working well | First eSIM didn‚Äôt work. Got a refund after an hour of talking to support. Second eSIM worked for about 5 days out of 10. Did not get a refund. I would not recommend this app, it made navigating Korea a nightmare üëç | I was TDY and this service worked really well . | Would not recommend. | Using Airalo was the best decision I have made. If you travel internationally. Airalo is the best option for you. You can do it locally regionally or you can do what I did get the global eSIM that I can use in any country. It comes with 20 GB of data use 200 text messages 200 minutes however most of us use Wi-Fi these are just basically for emergencies.. I would definitely recommend the global EM  if you travel a lot. And it lasts one full year and it‚Äôs easy to top it up.

It starts off simple, but gets more challenging. My only complaint is that I wish it used the standard Scrabble dictionary. There are many words that are acceptable in Scrabble, but not acceptable in Moxie ‚Äî and vice cersa. | I really enjoy this game but one aspect, the word tips,  are useless.
It  only suggests words with the lowest score! Why have word tips that facilitate a lower score? It‚Äôs no advantage at all. Just do away with it. | I absolutely love this game‚Ä¶to the point, I‚Äôve beaten ALL of the available levels. I‚Äôve traveled to all of the currently available countries and I‚Äôve beaten all of the archived daily challenge months. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life anymore‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a void I will somehow need to fill with something marginally acceptable as Moxie. | Love it | Really loved this game until it made me choose Word Tips. Don‚Äôt like being given hints! | I love this game because it truly makes you think and strategize as you place the letters. I enjoy both the daily challenge and the regular levels. I do wish there was one more goal on the daily challenge between 60 and a perfect 4 stars every day, usually about 120. It goes 20, 40, 60, 120. It would be nice to have one more goal, maybe 90? That said, it has become one of my favorite daily games. | Its nearly impossible to accrue points without purchasing them, which I will not do.  Don‚Äôt waste your time on this game. | Love it! I play many word games, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect with Moxie, but it‚Äôs smart and intriguing! There have been levels when I despaired of ever finishing, but I learn with every try. One huge quibble: I really hate the new Twaddle sound effect! Icky! Please change it! I like the rest of the sound effects, so I‚Äôd rather not have to play in silence, but that awful ‚Äúwah wah‚Äù is just insulting. Please change it! That said, I‚Äôll play on in silence if I have to, ‚Äòcause I love this game! | Have used many words that are valid dictionary words and game does not accept them. Why? What dictionary do you as creator follow? Consider myself to have excellent vocabulary & have used words you ‚Äútwaddle‚Äù.  Not quite fair & many times will cause loss of game. Explanation please! | Loved the game until I reached approximately level 148, where the rules changed and instructions were unclear.  The game offers no way to go back and review instructions.  In addition, rewards are relatively tiny compared to the effort invested.  The game is very quick to issue lengthy time-outs, but hard work is not rewarded. | I love how challenging this game is! And no ads!!! Thank you for not charging users to escape ads. | I stumbled across this game 3 days ago and absolutely love it! The levels can get challenging but I like that it‚Äôs not impossible to beat (I‚Äôm level 189 right now). I only wish there was a way to submit words to include in the game‚Äôs dictionary, because some real English words get ‚Äútwaddled‚Äù. | This is a great game. No ads. New challenges keep coming. Simple and pleasing graphics. It‚Äôs fun to morph new words. Some levels require multiple tries, but aren‚Äôt frustrating, just challenging. | This game is challenging and fun. It really exercises your brain not only with vocabulary, but also with strategic thinking and a little math. I play it way too often, but I love it. | Lots of fun! Keep up the great work! üëç | Let me play past your goal. It is difficult to stay interested when the game is over in a few plays! | I am definitely enjoying using this app, but it‚Äôs frustrating when a valid word, like ‚ÄúR OO‚Äú is considered a twaddle. However, overall, it‚Äôs a fun game, and I appreciate the fact that I don‚Äôt have to spend any money to play it. | I have played all of the Blue Ox games and enjoyed them all so far. This particular game is half baked. There‚Äôs just not much here. Not sure how this has over 4 stars. The game functions in such a way that you will just end up creating the same few words over and over again or will resort to just swapping out vowels. There is no real incentive to come up with unique words and that‚Äôs where this game misses. It gets really repetitive and boring pretty quickly. Also ‚Äúras‚Äù is considered a word but not ‚Äúfart‚Äù or ‚Äúfarted‚Äù? Come on! The word bank is very odd and excludes many common words which results in a lot of unnecessary twaddles. Also there is no way to see the game‚Äôs road map, meaning you can‚Äôt see how many locations there are to travel to and you can‚Äôt look back at where you‚Äôve been which makes the leveling up seem arbitrary and doesn‚Äôt feel rewarding. This game feels unfinished and was clearly just pumped out to make a quick buck. Not what I have come to expect from Blue Ox. Bummer. Skip this one. | After finding Moxie several months ago, I found it to be so enjoyable. But with the newest update, it has definitely lost its appeal. Having to complete 1500 points every day of the month to attain the monthly bonus seems stingy.  I‚Äôve found myself losing interest in playing Moxie at all. | Until the last update, this game was so much fun. The recent update ruined it. It used to have some easier challenges and some tricker! Now, I can‚Äôt complete any without using all my comps to complete. Now it‚Äôs just frustrating. Sorry you changed it! | Overall, a great game, but several common words in standard dictionaries get twaddled. The most recent one is ‚Äúade.‚Äù This (and several others) actually is (are) in the dictionary. If we know what dictionary you are using, we can avoid unnecessary twaddles. 
Overall though, lots of fun! | Just deleted this game after having enjoyed it for several months. The latest update(s) have made it impossible to achieve anything, if much at all. For example, what is the reasoning behind making the daily challenge even more difficult? Way to make what used to be a fun game super discouraging. | Thank you for this | A smart and fun game, no popup ads, and each round is short enough and with enough variables to make the game constantly challenging‚Äîespecially the higher up you go. This is my go-to waiting room time-passer now. Thanks! | I‚Äôve tried every possible angle for level 886. It gives almost all lower count tiles and having to get to required points, even with bonuses, is seemingly impossible. | I am deleting this game now. 
   Your latest update has ruined a fine game by making it feel cheap and boring. | Keeps getting better! I like the latest change that allows you to replay the daily puzzle until you get the maximum number of keys. (Some days take a lot of tries!) I‚Äôm on level 606 and still love the game. | Love Blue Ox games and this one is another hit. The writers are incredibly creative that sometimes I literally laugh out loud. Moxie is a winner!

 After much frustration they finally included the rules of the game.  That helped but they don‚Äôt allow the most common words and I can‚Äôt figure out why. Maybe they want you to buy more coins but you are dinged for playing everyday words. Of course you don‚Äôt know until you‚Äôve played it and then you forget they don‚Äôt accept that word four games later when you play it again and are re-shocked that you got dinged !!!  I play so many words game and this is the only game that doesn‚Äôt use dictionary.com or word lookup pro. 

I read other reviews and see I‚Äôm not alone in being disappointed that they‚Äôve run out of levels.  I‚Äôve played all the games and asked the developer through email support to let me keep my points and bonuses and restart my game so I could replay from the start but never heard back from them.  So like other Moxie players,  I too am anxiously waiting for more levels. 

This is the first app review I‚Äôve ever posted and have spent more on this game ($) than any other game. Hopefully they will work out the kinks because it‚Äôs an incredible game! üòÉ | This game is all the good things that others have expressed, but it also has drawbacks. For one, there are few ‚Äòrewards‚Äô of coins or power tools along the way, just lots of ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù to purchase same. All other games I play provide a small daily reward for checking-in, and bonus rewards during game play. Some levels are highly challenging (a good thing) but highly frustrating without power tools or coins to buy them (not a good thing). There also seems to be some stinginess when one runs out of lives, which take ¬Ω hour to regenerate. I‚Äôve used up all 5 lives, then closed out the game only to open it hours later and see that all 5 lives are still expired. As soon as I open the game, the first life is just beginning to regenerate. I‚Äôve seen several times when I‚Äôm on Life #5 and it tells me I‚Äôm 26 minutes before the next life is available. Several minutes later when I‚Äôve still not conquered that level, the clock resets back to 30 minutes until the next life is available.  I have also been awarded 4 power tools upon reaching a new ‚Äòdestination‚Äô only to have them all disappear after using just one. Also, the ‚ÄúUndo‚Äù tool is not available when one is at the end of the 5th life. Glitches or greediness? Either way, makes the game less pleasurable. | Fun and very addictive game!

Previously, I wrote the review below that I‚Äôm leaving up just in case someone else had the same problem I did.  Thank you to the administrators for clearly explaining what the problem was.  I had just jumped in and played for points, thinking I knew how to play.  I never had gone to ‚Äúthe book‚Äù to read the instructions before.  I just completed Level 199 which I had tried to best at least 2 dozen times (maybe 3).  The game is even more fun now.  Thank you also for responding in such a timely manner!  Great game, and good people at the helm!  üòä

What I wrote previously‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHowever, there is a glitch. There is a ‚Äúgoal‚Äù amount posted at the top left. Reaching that amount MAY cause the system to recognize you successfully reaching the goal‚Ä¶or NOT. Most of the time, while it will acknowledge ‚Äúgoal reached‚Äù on the top left, it does not end the round. It will just keep on counting until you run out of tiles, THEN tell you you FAILED to reach goal! On a 700 goal, I just did over 2200 and it still told me I failed! I wish y‚Äôall would fix this.‚Äù | This game makes me think and I like that! | Love this game, best of all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*****NO ADS*****üòÄüôÉüòÄüôÉüôèüòÄüôèüôÉüôèüòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è | From the Monkey Wrench creators, this new word fame, Moxie Word Traveler is just as intriguing and addictive as Monkey Wrench!  It‚Äôs a well developed and fun game!  Keep the good work up y‚Äôall! | I would rate the game itself as a 5, but it remains a 4 because:
** The font is way too small**.  It is very difficult to read the score or game requirements (number of letters, for example). | I love Blue Ox games and I love this one, but as someone else noted, after the basic tutorial, there is no help to remember what the perks you earn do for you.

Also, way too sensitive on iPad. In trying to use my index finger to place a letter on the puzzle, the base of my thumb touched the iPad resulting in a Twaddle and I was never able to make a word on that line again. I am sure there probably is a way to undo a move, but as mentioned above, I did not know what feature would fix this.

I played the original Moxie also and was surprised when this version allowed you to use words more than once. Like someone else, I kind of miss the themes, but realize that you have already done that. I honestly think this game could be even better with easy help reminders of what you can do with the various features. Having to leave your game to go back to a tutorial, till you memorize the symbols, is just too time consuming and makes me play less out of frustration.

Nevertheless, I like the game immensely but am hoping for updates to help. | You can‚Äôt delete the guy that tells you how to play the game. I know how to play the game. I don‚Äôt need to need the lessons at level six!!! | I‚Äôve only played for a day or so, but this game‚Äîlike everything I have from Blue Ox‚Äîis a fun and engaging word game! | I like this game but the scoring doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.  Right away my red hearts said ‚Äúfull‚Äù but I have no idea what that does or what it means.  I like to do the daily puzzle but you can‚Äôt earn any points that way.  I do several other puzzles each day but never earn any points.  How many puzzles do you need to do to earn points? Could you explain the scoring somewhere? | How is zen not a valid word? | This game is excellent-  I enjoy playing it | ‚ÄòFart‚Äô is not a twaddle! (Who thought those two words would ever be in the same sentence??) | This game is both fun and challenging | I love this game! Im on level 283
Play this game, you will not be disappointed!! | Best word game in a while, something new and clever. I‚Äôm addicted! | This game sounded really interesting when I read the description. I tried to download it, and it was successful. When I tried to open and play the game, my phone would freeze due to using a screen reader. I hope you all can provide easy access for those of us who are blind and visually impaired, in order for us to enjoy what this app has to offer as well. thanks in advance for trying to improve accessibility for all! | I love this game! I‚Äôm just surprised that some words aren‚Äôt accepted like: zen, Dane, June. I thought these were fairly common words. | I love the game. However when you‚Äôre trying to reverse a selection (going back or redo), which is allowed and costs a few points, the game locks up and you lose your points and progress. Very frustrating. | This is the perfect game. For all of you word game people, this game is challenging and fun. Please add more levels. | Game froze again when I tried to change move I made.

A bunch of my restaurants are gone from my map, which defeats the entire purpose of the app. switching to Beli. | Love the app but even after several exchanges with developer still cannot edit locations that do not have an address which are the majority of my 1k locations (waterfalls, trailheads, kayaking river access points) ‚Ä¶ | I found the interface very confusing when I tried to skip entering my phone number. After a bad review and multiple developer follow ups, I finally found how to skip it. I still think it should be more clear. Update: My one star review is because of the interface regarding entering my phone number which I found to be confusing. The screen has a blue circle with a white phone at the top and a big empty field which says ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your phone number?‚Äù and way down at the bottom of the screen it says ‚ÄúShow My Friends‚Äù This interface is bad because in the previous screens I was asked for my preferences, and I was asked to share my contacts, which I declined. These screens had a very helpful ‚ÄúLater‚Äù button which gave me a clear way to skip. But this last screen that asks for phone number did NOT have a ‚ÄúLater‚Äù button. So it switched interface paradigms near the end of the process after setting up my expectation that I could skip with a ‚ÄúLater‚Äù button. So I assumed if I tapped ‚ÄúShow My Friends‚Äù it would tell me the phone number field was required. I am the user. I found it confusing. I am entitled to give a one star review for an app that I found hard to use. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would. I might reconsider if they make the screen more clear and add a ‚ÄúLater‚Äù or a ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù button to that phone number screen. Otherwise, my review is one star and I gave it because in my opinion the interface of the app was confusing to me when I wanted to skip entering my phone number. Also, since I did not share my contacts or enter my phone number, it makes no sense to have a button labeled ‚ÄúShow My Friends.‚Äù My intention was to use this app as a way to bookmark cool places I have been. Nothing to do with friends. Which again, think about how confusing the interface is: I did not share contacts or enter a number, and now the only button I was given was ‚ÄúShow My Friends.‚Äù It makes no sense. Especially as a new user, I am expecting a ‚ÄúShow the Map‚Äù button or something like that. As I said: I found this interface to be confusing. | I absolutely love the idea of this app, I‚Äôve had it for awhile but every time I try to open it I have to ‚Äúreconnect‚Äù it to my Facebook account and 75% of the time it just won‚Äôt reconnect and I can‚Äôt pull up my maps. 

So many bugs that need to be fixed that have been occurring over the last 5+ months. | Perfect way to organize all my favorite spots without cluttering my driving maps.  Can‚Äôt recommend enough!! | I absolutely love mapstr whenever I have a day off I love to go explore news places right in my own backyard! Or if I am coincidentally in the area of a place I‚Äôve marked I always try to make a stop, thanks to alerts that you can set. I could rave Al day about the customization of this app truly but, I did come here to say 2 things, one, that I wish there was a function where you could pin something and it would recommend you others like it or things others near that location have pinned! I think it would be a great addition because sometimes place really are hidden. Two maybe having a toggle function where you could see reviews for the place you‚Äôve pinned if you wanted. I love having my own personal map but sometimes for places I haven‚Äôt been a review would be helpful. I understand that‚Äôs what the internet is for but having it streamlined into one place is just a little more convenient. I love this app with all my heart and regardless of what I think I will continue to use it forever :) | The app logs me off and tries to get me to establish a new account every time I open it.  No one has the time for that, no matter how useful a new app may be and even if they love the concept‚Ä¶ | I just want to say that you guys did a great job with this app. For several years now I‚Äôve been keeping everything in my notes, but this is clearly superior. I have one improvement that can be made since I saw another app do it. I like the tags feature, but you can make it so that we can modify the order that they are shown in on our list? I think it would be nice for aesthetic purposes. Because that way my tags can all be in the same order down the list without me having to delete and re add them in order every time. | I‚Äôve been using Mapster for a number of years. I travel a lot for business and I would store restaurants and other places for reference for when I‚Äôm on a trip and seek a restaurant or tourist spot I have saved in the area. 
It is probably user error but as the app has evolved, my ability to find saved items where I‚Äôm at, or search for places I‚Äôve stored, but don‚Äôt recall exactly what they are called, has become an exercise in frustration for me. I really liked it as a reference library of my places, I‚Äôm not really interested in the social media aspects. | I just wish the app was more offline/offgrid friendly. Or at least have the ability to toggle a button to turn on/save for offline use. The app will not open if I have no signal/wifi. And sometimes I can get it to work offline if I stick my phone in airplane mode (50-50 chance). Other than that, it‚Äôs a pretty swell app. | I have used this app on several trips. The ability to map sites of interest is such an excellent idea and tool for travel. However, you cannot retain or add maps. If there is an ability to add additional maps then I could not determine how. | When I first found Mapstr about three years ago I recommended it to many of my friends out of my excitement with what it was then and hopes for its future. Unfortunately, the app seems to me to have been on a fairly constant trajectory towards feature bloat that has made the core experience harder to use and appears to have degraded performance.

I wish the tremendous effort that it must have taken to convert this app to a social network would have been instead directed to making improvements to the UX of the core experience of adding and viewing places. Specifically the biggest issue to me is content density: there is lots of whitespace in the UI, there is much less information displayed about a place than in other map apps (so that I have never been able to meaningfully rely on Mapstr for this info), and many touch targets are too small by modern standards. Also important to me is performance, especially on app launch, which is unfortunately much slower than other apps (and often banners appear which further distract from accessing the map quickly).

On the social side, I would have been quite happy with the simple ability to share lists/categories/map via link, and no concept of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù whatsoever.

HOWEVER, I have a lot of respect for the developer, which seems to be a really small team, possibly just one engineer. Persevering with a project like this, where your competition is all massive companies, for as long as you have (without selling out!) is impressive and commendable. I still think Mapstr has potential if the development focus can be returned to the core experience. | Mapstr is by far my favorite utility app. I love recommending others use it because if they don‚Äôt have mapstr then they aren‚Äôt able to remember all of the cool places they hear about to visit, especially in our home city, Chicago. | The app is nice itself, just wish they didn‚Äôt sell your data. Now I get random creepy emails from the CEO of this app asking me to verify my email address over and over again and junk emails addressed to my burner handle (which I created especially for this app), so I know it was them who sold it to the scammers. So annoying. | This app is a great for keeping track of all the places you want to save. However, I would really like the option to use it on an iPad. Developers: can you please update this app so it can fit on a larger full screen display? | This app used to be fantastic but the recent changes to it have been fairly detrimental 
Firstly when I open the app I don‚Äôt want/care about a news page, everyone is clearly only using it for the map section 
Secondly the performance has taken a hit recently, I used to be able to speed through different saved places but now there is a second lag when selecting/deselecting places
The centre arrow button‚Ä¶ hitting that should always just centre on your location, move the ‚Äòcentre elsewhere‚Äô button somewhere separate 
Basically I used to love this app and recommend to everyone because it was so smooth and easy to use and had such a clean interface, it‚Äôs not the same anymore | Good luck mapstr | I‚Äôve been using this app for years as my way to keep track of bars and restaurants and I think it‚Äôs the best way to do it. But it keeps getting more and more bloated every time they add ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù that distract from its main purpose which is a map app. I don‚Äôt need prompts, recommendations, and lists. I just want to have a directory of my favorite places. | No matter what I do it won‚Äôt let me get past the sign up or sign in process, it asks me if I want to follow a list of people and then it starts to load the map and then crashes. I have not been able to use the app. | Hey guys, love the app but if I can make a suggestion, it would be so useful to see the names of the places we added on the map without having to click on the tiles which can be slow and inefficient. Would be great to be able to eyeball all the names.

Thank you!
Matthieu | Used this app throughout Spain and France and it was great to keep track of all the placed we wanted to go and learn from others what to check out.  Hate using it on the phone though.  When will the tablet format come out? | Just got the app and the first place I added shows the correct address on the listing, but shows up in the wrong place (a few miles away) in the map. I added a couple more that seemed to be accurate. But by the 7th one, the opposite error, is shows up in the right place on the map, but has the wrong address (completely different state this time) and even name of the restaurant wrong.

Seems like a cool idea for an app, but I haven‚Äôt even added 10 things yet and I‚Äôve already run into two big errors with their database. I reported the errors to Mapstr through their app, so we‚Äôll see if they get fixed, but that many problems right off the bat doesn‚Äôt bode well. | I have iPhone 12 Pro Max with latest iOS and am currently in Singapore. I love this app a lot and it‚Äôs exactly what I want except the gps doesn‚Äôt work. The precise location doesn‚Äôt work either and doesn‚Äôt notify me when I‚Äôm nearby even though I enabled it. The support couldn‚Äôt resolve this. Such a pity because this would be great in singapore and Asia but I can‚Äôt recommend it if the main feature doesn‚Äôt work here. The company should really look into it. | I‚Äôve tried several apps that were meant to serve the same purpose, but each was always lacking something. THIS ONE IS PERFECT! They cover all the bases. | Great interface, but EXTREMELY buggy. Expect the app to freeze about twice for every one time that it works properly. | Another app that forces you to create an account so they can get your email or facebook info, as well as your travel wants and history. All I want to do is make sense of the hundreds of places Ive been. Simple. An account should be a choice. | Crashes when opening the app | Love the app! Please please just add the following 
1. Ability to rate each location 
2. Ability to add dollar signs of cost | Please explain why my account that I have used for years, was erased. | I love this app! I‚Äôve been using it to keep track of places I want to visit all over the world. It‚Äôs awesome. Super easy to use and fully functional. Great dev as well. I have two suggestions: a colorblind mode and a tip option. The tags get very difficult to read if you‚Äôre colorblind. And, for people that really don‚Äôt need premium features, it‚Äôs be nice to be able to support the development with a tip now and again. | Use it all the time for recommendations, places I see and want to try, and places I want to remember in NYC | The map and places tracking tool is way better than any other app out there now for simplicity and ease of use. 
EXCEPT. That no matter what I do, restart, update software, delete, redownload, it always slows down all apps on my phone. Not just this app, its not only warping time in its own world, but it slows down everything on my entire phone until I close it several times.
These bugs are going to ruin it for me! So disappointed, I even emailed about it and never got a response. | I‚Äôm so glad my boyfriend introduced me to this app. I love being able to look back at places I‚Äôve all visited, notes about what we ate, and to see other places nearby. | I love this app - I especially like the way it allows me to track locations that I want to remember to visit the next time I am traveling to a location, or even to keep track of cool spots and highly-rated restaurants in my hometown, with tags and/or ‚Äúyou are nearby alerts‚Äù to help me find them when I finally get around to checking them out. Highly recommend! | I have been searching for years of a way to keep track of the fabulous food scene of Chicago.  Mapstr is the best app to do that. Tagging by neighborhood, cuisine, chef, great rooftop etc etc has been super helpful for me to be able to easily pull up great options that meet my criteria. Many friends and family contact me because they know I‚Äôll have great recommendations on where they should go because of mapstr. I love how there‚Äôs now more room for a restaurant description. More detail has helped so much! I also love that I can include links to online articles about the place so I can easily find more info. Super excited to continue to add more locations to my mapstr!! | I know there is a social aspect to this app, but I really use it to keep track of places I want to go in cities I‚Äôm exploring. For that, it‚Äôs perfect. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that you have to tag everything, but that‚Äôs not a big deal because it forced me to be a little more organized in my locations. | Mapstr is the second app I use the most, right after Instagram. I use it in my hometown or when I travel, I store my own spots or look for new ones to discover. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more!! | It‚Äôs just perfect. A clean, simple way to track and remember places I want to visit or have already been and loved. | I love Mapstr, it is so useful in my everyday life! Very easy to use and so practical! Being able to add tags to every places you save on the app makes it super customizable and practical. I no longer have 100 notes on my phone with restaurants ideas my friends talked to me about or that I saw a month ago in a magazine: all these places are on my Mapstr, ready to be tried! Also, being able to take inspos on my friend‚Äôs maps is what makes it much better than any other app! 
Really love it! Recommend ++ | Great app to save all your best places in one place. I‚Äôve been using it daily for more than one year and the app works very well! | My only regret is not having this app 10 years to keep and share my favorites addresses | I love Mapstr and have been using it for a few years now. Maps are important to me when I travel and having this app suits my way of organizing the things I read or hear about that I want to visit. It‚Äôs also handy in LA where I live, since there are cool things to see and eat in many neighborhoods that may be off my beaten path. In Paris last fall I was able to easily see places that I had been plugging in rather than going thru a folder full of old clippings and then not knowing where they were, my previous method of saving good ideas. Very useful! | I love this app, it‚Äôs how I keep track of all the restaurants I have visited and want to try. I highly recommend it! | Love this app! Using it all the time! How to get reviews from people you trust instead of strangers... | For anyone serious about exploring (read: people who are both curious and organized), you can do no better than Mapstr. | I love Mapstr. I love to travel and use a map to help me plan and navigate trips. Mapstr allows me to save the places that I‚Äôve been and reference them as I go. You can share your map with friends or keep it to yourself as you travel over time. Very simple to use and easy to understand. | When I find a new venue to visit or get a recommendation, Mapstr is the way I keep track. My favorite is going to a neighborhood I‚Äôm not typically in and looking at the spots I‚Äôve marked. Easiest way to keep the adventures flowing. | This app was recommended to me by a French friend a few years ago. I love it!

1. It‚Äôs great for those times you walk past restaurants and think I‚Äôd like to try that but then you always forget. This way you can just save straight into the app

2. You can save places you‚Äôve been so you don‚Äôt forget them. Especially for holiday destinations 

3. You can share with friends who ask you for recommendations and the tagging system helps localize their preferences

I am not going to pay for any weather service, but in the process to get noaa updated it repeatedly takes me to the ‚Äúyou have to pay for radar‚Äù page. I‚Äôm finally past that but now I‚Äôm not able to get any radar to come up‚Ä¶but the ‚Äúpay for it‚Äù option continues to cover the bottom of my screen üò° The updated version is full of useless/unnecessary charts and graphs, just give the forecast each day: high-low, wind & percentages for precipitation. Should‚Äôve stayed with what I had, expect to delete noaa and try something else. | I don‚Äôt live in or near Harrisburg Junction! | The app no longer displays radar on my device. I also hate the forecast  they added to the bottom of the display. Why take something that works and mess with it? | I turned off notifications, but still received them. I was also receiving multiple notifications for the same exact alerts. So annoying. | I hav e had this as go to for many years, now with ‚Äòupdates‚Äô all I get is crash after 2-4 seconds.  Deleted it. | At 84 years of age I have lots of experience with weather forecasting. I trust my own judgement and with the help of your radar I don‚Äôt even have to go outside to do it. 
As a child, my father and I would go outside and watch the sky and judge if we needed to go to the storm cellar or back in the house. A couple of time it was a quick trip!
Kansas is known for its unpredictable weather. Cliches like: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like the weather, just wait a few minutes, it will change.‚Äù And my favorite, which is always right, ‚Äúit is going to be light today and dark tonight.‚Äù | ‚Ä¶me to this App. Not always as accurate as Dark Skies was, but the best one going.  Sometimes it‚Äôs gotten a little wonky‚Äîlike Silver Spring MD for example.

 But in comparison to other weather apps, this is my current gold standard. Would be nice if they crowd sourced weather‚Ä¶thought like that might have helped with accuracy of predicting weather and timing. | Good | This is an interesting app with great info, but it can't even locate me correctly?  It reports me in Junction Texas when I am in San Angelo.  These are NOT very close locations.  

Keep trying guys ... | I know people need to get paid but seriously! How many adds do I need? | Just subscribed today! End of February! | Warnings and forecasts and my location cover the radar on the map. Not very high resolution. Pretty but not that useful. There are better apps. | The advertisement for this app says free, UNTIL, you download it and you‚Äôre informed that it is ‚Äú free ‚Äú for three days, then you have to choose a subscription service. | Very impactful! | I've tried using this, and it expects payment. It's not that user-friendly, and keeps giving me forecast of other areas that I've already left.

Whatever happened to where apps and automatically sits where you are now?

This is obviously not one of them. | Used to be great! Over the past year or so tho, the new developers decided to revamp the look, now it's totally broken. Have to go thru a ritualistic open and close the app two times just to see the temperature.
And the layout is horrible! | I wrote a ChatGPT called Motorycle Mapper Pro and I use this to back it up, turn by turn directions without tolls and highways! Good Job | I really like this weather app so far very accurate has everything I need. The one thing I have problems with is the widget every morning it is blank takes a while for it to warm up and start working. | Thank you love it. | The two small towns I frequent and want to know the forecast for do not populate. They are large enough to populate on all other weather apps.
This is very disappointing. | I just wanted to thank everyone for the support I get in getting through this winter with the accurate information and the fact that you guys are always spot on. I hope you all have a great 2024üëçüåè | This app wants $600 a year to look at the weather? | Nice app but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any way to unsubscribe so be prepared to pay for it for the rest of your life | Porn ads | The actual radar of this ‚ÄúWeather Radar‚Äù app is completely meaningless. They now only provide 120 minutes of historical data and ZERO time of future radar.  I have several weather apps, all free, this one is no longer of any value so I am deleting it. | Outstanding.I can keep up with the weather in all my important places! | This app sends out tons of notifications for storms that aren‚Äôt even happening. The weather predictions are not even close to accurate. I got 7 notifications, one per hour, for a so called blizzard that isn‚Äôt predicted on any other weather platform. It is not even snowing. Do not recommend. | Radar only goes about 1 hour ahead.  Useless. | Gracias | Worst radar app I have ever used , it will be raining on me and this app shows nothing in my area . Don‚Äôt waist your money and time. | The number one in weather forecast.. | First off- this app does not recognize my city. No matter how I try it calls Cedar Rapids ‚ÄúEast Rapids‚Äù. Not a big deal but indicative and annoying. The hourly forecast is rarely useful. Especially when the weather is dynamic. I guess it does give me weather alerts, but my radio can do that. Just waiting for my subscription to run out. | Too much upselling. How many times do I have to say NO! | Always give the correct news of weather!!!! | Obnoxious selling of prenup | I like the game but I keep lagging and keep getting kicked out. It might be me because my tablet it old. Overall I think it is a great game. | I've downloaded every weather app, this one is most accurate and fav | This app is un accurate, not real time weather another words you‚Äôre gonna get wet if you look at there is rain coming | This is a really good weather app and has nice info | Force you to weekly subscription unless you cancel.  Not easy to cancel.  If I‚Äôd known, no way I would have purchased. | Widgets no longer work üòü | I miss the old weather app Dark Sky. One of the things I loved about Dark Sky was that it was able to give you a view of the radar over multiple days.

The current Apple , weather map only gives 12 hours and not multiple days. To me this is a major failing. | I wish that you could see more of the weather on the radar because I love weather and want to see it without paying for stuff. | Enjoy looking to see where and when we may get some rain. | Charts not synchronized. Text and data overlap on the screen; they‚Äôre almost unrecognizable. | Living in a constant zone of changes, much of daily life is dictated by our weather.

Reviews and Testimonials:

‚ÄúHigh-quality self-guided walking tours...Narrated by local experts, they provide insight into corners of the city sometimes overlooked by regular guided tours.‚Äù
Lonely Planet

‚ÄúWe may be biased, but could there be anything more helpful than having a journalist in your pocket when touring a new city? How about a historian, a novelist or just a really passionate local? VoiceMap culls city-specific stories from them all and fits them neatly into walking tours.‚Äù
New York Times

‚ÄúMy wife and I really enjoyed exploring Bruges at our own pace with this audio tour, and there were some memorable stories that the narrator shared. Also, the app worked great in relation to the location-based services. We easily followed the map and the audio was triggered in the appropriate spots. In comparison to the packs of people wandering the city with tour guides, this was a much better fit for us.‚Äù
Viator review, Rick A

‚ÄúBrilliant. Can go at your own pace, good information and took us to places we would never have found ourselves.‚Äù
Tripadvisor review, Ravin D

‚ÄúIt was enjoyable to be under no time pressure to freely roam the city of Pisa as we so pleased. Wandering from attraction to attraction. The app is clever, concise and easy to use! Would do again - especially with another person or solo traveler.‚Äù
GetYourGuide review, Grace L

‚ÄúGreat quality information - interesting and entertaining. The time flew by. And no waffle! This is far better than any other guided tour we found - they are much more expensive and far less informative. And you can do this tour any time, any day, at your own pace, and even do it twice!‚Äù
Tripadvisor review, Carcassonne 's Medieval Walls: A Self-Guided Tour

‚ÄúGreat value for money, interesting and very clear and easy to follow! I learnt lots about London I didn't already know and I have lived here over 30 years.‚Äù

‚ÄúI loved the tour, bought all of the New Orleans ones you had and have already recommended it to two people. I will without a doubt continue to use the app.‚Äù

We saw places and learned so much more than had we explored on our own. She also delivers her stories in a fun, friendly, connected way. 

VoiceMap is a great way to do self managed inexpensive tours. We continue to enjoy it. | This was fantastic.  I t was my first time using this service, but it will not be the last! | I am a big Context Travel fan. But this tour was one of the most unique things I have done with context yet. It took me to areas of Tokyo. I didn‚Äôt know alongside some of the most famous places., Excitement, intensity, and com altogether I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who has an afternoon or morning in Tokyo. Thank you very much. | My first trip to London. So I knew nothing. But I‚Äôm guessing the info shared may be enjoyable for anyone. I adored this experience. I‚Äôm a solo traveler and having Ian McKellen guide me with his humor etc. was fun. I laughed out loud a few times.  I will be recommending to my friends. Great walk through London Theater district. And free on VoiceMap. (He has a stop at a pub along the way.) | Exactly what I was looking for. I frequent Geneva but never had the chance to explore it or learn much about its history. This was a great introduction with a great narrator. The app is well designed‚Äîit allows you to put down the phone, stop whenever you would like, and continue the tour seamlessly. Great idea! | So nice to walk and never have to look at your phone.   It knows where you are and talks when it‚Äôs supposed to when you arrive at each spot. Terrific! | Wonderful and interesting walking tour. Just the right length for the heat! | The tour of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico was most delightful and informative. The concept of having students of a with-grade class guide us around the city was very creative and was expertly produced. I will recommend this tour to others visiting San Juan. Thank you for a fantastic and joyful tour. | Excellent. Just enough detail, clearly presented and informative | Traveling through Europe, we are loving this. Great tours and directions. We had looked for similar audio tours a couple years back while traveling in New Orleans and had no luck. This is EXACTLY what we‚Äôd wanted then and briefly considered designing our own app to fill the void. You‚Äôve done the job well! | This was a great tour. John, the Australian guide, was interesting, informative, and funny. The pace was good with just the right amount of history and commentary. I took this tour at my own pace over three days, stopping at all the places that I wanted to see inside. It was a perfect tour of Valencia. I will definitely look for his other tours when I go to different cities. Two thumbs up! | This self-guided tour is an excellent way to see & hear for yourself and at your own pace the history of York. It‚Äôs a magnificent place, well worth the tour and the small fee for the tour. | Loved this app and made my trip that much more informative | Great self guided audio tour with accompanying GPS | What a well-organized and pleasant app for taking a nice, leisurely walking tour. I used my tour to walk around Inverness. My initial doubts were swiftly assuaged as soon as the walk began. The tour guide is very amiable and knowledgeable. The maps are easy to follow. You can pause or linger at a site of interest as long as you like and then pick up the tour where you left off. I learned a lot about the beautiful city of Inverness. I highly recommend this app! | Excellently done and great stops along the way | Let me to start off by saying that functionality wise, this is a very exciting app.  The audio synced to location works well and it‚Äôs an exciting way to explore a city on your own if you don‚Äôt wish to do an organized group walking tour.  The tours I took through this app in Granada, Spain completely enhanced my trip to the city taking me to places I wouldn‚Äôt go on my own and giving me a ton of great information in the history of the city.  That said, I found that the tours for other cities I used the app in (Seville and Madrid) were much less successful.  This app runs on free lance content and it‚Äôs missing a lot of basic walking tours for popular tourist cities, and some of the tours it does offer for those cities are too niche to be appealing for most users.  Hopefully this will change in the future if the app continues to attract creators but right now it‚Äôs missing some key content. | lots of interesting information, fun stops. Well done. | I‚Äôve used voice map for several tours now. I have found them all interesting and different than the ‚Äútour guide‚Äù tours you would otherwise receive. The GPS enabled feature is awesome!

Only drawback is that they are still building out their inventory of tours. So, there may not be a tour in the location you want. | Just what we had hoped.  Well worth the money! You won‚Äôt regret taking this tour. 

Huntsville, Alabama | I was not sure what to see, but did not want to go a group pace. I really enjoyed the tour and the guidance worked perfect. | Outstanding technology blended with expert knowledge of the location at Kilkenny Ireland.  Nice job! | One of the best I‚Äôve ever had and I loved doing it at my own pace. | I used this app a few years ago in Greece to do an amazing tour in Chania but have used it many times since. So fun to hear about a town from a local‚Äôs perspective and learn about the area, buildings & history! | The description starts and stops at the right times automatically. The guide is informative and interesting. | Great information! Appreciated that we could walk at our own pace. Also allowing us to stop
along the way. | Nicely done. The GPS worked well. The information was well presented. Mixture of modern and historical information included with the architectural details. | I liked the tour and the tour guide but my audio kept skipping so I had to read the script. The App was hard to navigate. | I don't fully understand how one doesn't hear of this area in Madrid. M3 from the Gran Via area to the start and M5 at the end of the tour back to the Gran Via area. Fantastic walking tour of an unadvertised local treasure. Google the Madrid Rio Project then take this tour! | Fabulous overview of history and town and architecture. We loved it! Highly recommend this for learning about this historic town and seeing a myriad of places. Narration was fabulous. Thank you! | I highly recommend this app for city tours to use alone or with friends! | Taking a tour with a family of 6 can be cost-prohibitive, so we discovered VoiceMap looking for a less expensive way to visit Charleston, SC and better appreciate the history and significance. We found this app to be exactly what we needed. We found the historical and architectural background to be helpful and very interesting, and we loved going through alleys and less-toured areas. The map gave us confidence that we were headed the right way, and the audio cues were very helpful. | The best app I‚Äôve used for walking tours which makes it easier to leave your phone in your pocket.the content for the Cork tour was also great. | Surprisingly cool app for self guided audio tours. (FWIW j find the UI a little idiosyncratic.) | Amazing once you get it working. We downloaded what must have been a preview of a tour, and took us several minutes after it stopped working to realize we needed to DELETE the sample in downloads after purchasing, THEN redownload from purchases to have access to the full tour. If your tour stops working and just chimes at you when you try to hear things, try this solution. | Very glitchy | Great walk and info
Clear voice | Would like to be able to connect two sets of AirPods Pros, like I can with the iPhone‚Äôs Podcasts app. | Fantastic 

Just what we wanted | As someone who loves solo travel, this app delivers amazing content from its creators. So many good tours on here!! The one thing the app is lacking is the ability to ‚Äúsave‚Äù or create a wishlist of tours you are interested in purchasing. I often browse the tours and then just have to write down the ones I‚Äôm interested in potentially buying. | The content of the tour was 5+ stars. Unfortunately, the audio on the app kept skipping a few seconds frequently, so I probably only heard a quarter of the tour; very frustrating. I tried everything to fix, including deleting and re-installing the app.
I‚Äôm using an iPhoneX with the latest update. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the problem. | I worked perfectly and we were able to follow along very clearly to the directions.  Highly recommended! | Came up from Columbus to explore Toledo and loved this guided tour!  The history of the oWE is very interesting and seeing the old mansions was a treat.  Highly recommended! | I hardly ever, if I ever write a review about an app, but I downloaded this one this morning upon arriving in Verona, Italy, and I had such an amazing day learning about the town, its history, its most famous landmarks, in such an easy to follow way while guided by a native Veronese. The app uses your location and is very precise. I can‚Äôt recommend this app enough.
Yes, you will have to pay to download individual guides for each city but trust me, if you are visiting a city and are interested in actually learning about it, a few bucks is totally worth it. | GPS not syncing 100% | Precise, easy to follow directions and a really fun,fact-filled narrative. It took us about 2 hours to do, but we paused several times to duck into wine stores, look around the farmers‚Äô market, see the inside of Notre Dame de Dijon, etc. We decided to start our three-day stay in Dijon with this tour and we‚Äôre glad we did! Dave, Lausanne | We used the tours from this app in several European cities - Amsterdam, Bruges, Paris and they all were entertaining and informative. 
This format of tour is very convenient - you do it at your pace, always hear the guide and can rewind if needed. | Excellent tour - highly recommend!!!! | Terrible/glitchy app skips the stop instead of playing it when you click to play a stop‚Ä¶ also doesn‚Äôt have directional arrows to show you which direction to go, which is especially tough at the start when the beginning/ending paths are parallel (-_-) it‚Äôs about 11,000 steps with slippery cobble stone steps to traverse and climb- bring water and an umbrella! | We love the step by step but at your own pace!

Eddie Burke | Because of tv show u can watch. | I love this best show never because like longer time ghost Adventures very night Saturday Friday josh | I bought a projector a couple weekends ago and hooked my phone up to it through HDMI and tried Travl Channel Go app and won‚Äôt let me play a show in AirPlay mode. | Great app | It‚Äôs so awesome, I can watch my shows anytime I want and I can save them and watch them all over again, especially like the fact that you don‚Äôt have to pay for the subscription ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç | I watch around 4 mins of program before I have to watch 3 mins of commercials. Sorry but there is no excuse for that. I don‚Äôt mind some commercials but this is ridiculous. | Why | This app is worthless. You watch maybe three minutes of a show when the buffering starts. When you do get it to play again it starts over or you get ad after ad. I have even tried the app on other devices and get the same thing every time. | THIS IS LE EPIC AND I LOVE THIS TY E | You could let people make accounts without a TV provider so they could add there favorite shows to a playlist | I love watching expedition Bigfoot and the secret of Skinwalker Ranch. Those are two of my favorite shows on the Travel Channel. I also love ghost adventures are always exploring some interesting facility or venue. The Travel Channel just has a lot of interesting programs that always keep me entertained and coming back for more. | Need all the tony bourdain and Andrew Zimmer i can get | It freezes up a whole lot on my TV but on my phone it works fine | Love watching this channel. Who knew there are so many people interested in the paranormal? Great shows. Great fun. I hope nothing decides to pick on an avid watcher. | I regularly have to delete the app and re download for it to recognize my provider. It will say I don‚Äôt have this channel included when I in fact do. So I have to delete and redownload and it will work for a couple days. On iPad Pro with latest iOS. | The channel has great shows but you cannot watch a show on your iPad and cast it to your TV without an additional commercials.
You need to view a 3 minute commercial and if you stopped it on the casting and went back to your iPad there is another commercial again.  It doesn‚Äôt keep place where you were when you go back from a pause it starts in the beginning again also it‚Äôs very hard to watch a show to the end without freezing up it needs lots of work from the developers it‚Äôs terrible | Shows are great as always but the same advertisement over and over . It‚Äôs like watching live TV. I can see the advertisement in the beginning but it‚Äôs wayyyyy too muc | High Quality Streaming 24/7! Love it! | User friendly app with few restrictions for those without a TV subscription/ plan, as I stream from apps like Netflix/ Amazon Prime or play PS4 games instead, so i can still use the app to see shows or episodes I can‚Äôt find anywhere else | Everything was great it was my favorite app until I couldn‚Äôt cast to my tv anymore. Keeps saying no devices available but with other channel apps it works perfectly fine. So I know it‚Äôs not my tv or network. | Would not link to my tv provider but with help from customer support works great now!!
Thank You!! | I like the update however on the the just added it doesn‚Äôt seem to be updating like it should, it didn‚Äôt  show when the new episode of kindred spirits was on but it was on the shows lists of episodes. | So I love the Travel Channel, and this app helps me keep up with my favorite shows, but over the last week I‚Äôve noticed that there‚Äôs an issue with the time stamps being cut off early and not working properly. No matter the actual length of a show, every show length says 41:58 and will go into ‚Äúnext episode in ‚Ä¶‚Äù at 41:00. It‚Äôs not terribly an issue but it‚Äôs just a very annoying bug.",4.77365,20486,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/08/3d/6f/083d6f7a-ca64-1c16-25eb-c9594f02458f/c2327017-844b-4dc7-8706-a0f11cd0e1fe_Screen_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/99/98/ce/9998ce83-19f7-ac7d-1f33-05ad7418c601/49489d9b-6b4d-4001-8f33-4cb76436222e_Screen_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ef/4e/f0/ef4ef0f9-8f36-65f5-e962-d7fb2a5187e6/0775e3ac-b64e-4387-88c5-e381a3b1371d_Screen_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/21/3e/1e/213e1efa-c867-d1e6-1ce5-2afefbc6bce6/a06a2538-a0ef-4f22-afb7-565411026ce4_Screen_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a5/37/d0/a537d0df-2110-f2be-a6cd-32274676f07a/361d5cf5-6298-4296-94d3-85d4fe8162f2_Screen_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5a/d4/d0/5ad4d0f4-cd90-8bf9-d881-e54d5d3d11c2/6a653880-4704-4f38-bfdb-bec9a5acf251_Screen_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/22/ed/62/22ed62a4-79ed-5b1a-85e8-2cbf3f614333/f07ca6f1-1e01-44cf-93d7-3f8e44fc1e34_Screen_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0f/f3/04/0ff3043b-4066-99c5-99e0-d4f3b32f13e6/64504261-5c8f-448a-ab23-f716d7e9d8c3_Screen_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/67/47/b7/6747b71f-7705-8e3b-677b-865c4ea2b49d/df92d9fe-2064-4326-b710-6692d207cb63_Screen_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b0/31/92/b0319234-b9db-026c-55cd-623de1fe57ae/1d1ba9fd-8ea3-4e49-a882-25be380eba0b_Screen_5.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Too many links | Royal Caribbean is hosting a charter, booked only through travel agents.
I had booked an air to see airplane ticket two months ago through Royal Caribbean. 
Never did they inform me was it canceled 
Nor did they give back my money,  yet.
two months prior to this review,February 3. They let me know that, their royal Caribbean agent was new, explaining she didn‚Äôt know procedure, which is not to book air if it‚Äôs a charter sail. They are to redirect me to my Travel agent, which she did not do. 
Had I not been looking to purchase insurance, I would never have known I did not have airline tickets.  I have a receipt, flight information, seats assigned and, of course, money taken out of my account.
Because of this, I have to buy airline tickets for much more than what was originally purchased two months ago as the sail date is just around the corner. 
They‚Äôre sorry but that‚Äôs it. 
They explained that they would give me a $50 credit for my inconvenience however upon calling to redeem my credit, they tell me it‚Äôs not there. 
I had just done this two days ago with Maria. They‚Äôre supervisor. 
That woman is unfindable, imagine that? 
My recommendation is to NOT use this company for anything.
If you do, deal with one person and one person only. 
Do not rely on anything they say, as I‚Äôve been on the phone for seven  plus hours. 
They said it takes time to return your money up to two billing cycles. I found that interesting as they canceled a port, which we had rented a cabana.
That money came back the very next day after their informing me via email.
One would think after receiving emails from them that they would have naturally given me an email regarding my cancellation.
They‚Äôve told me to go kick rocks, and no one can seem to help me.
I‚Äôm still waiting for my money. | I would have liked to know when the on board entertainment became available to select via an alert on my phone. | It should always have home at every frame | Couldn‚Äôt find any list of mock tails.  Accessible excursions not available in all ports | Why can I not see the excursion I booked for my Iceland cruise in my calendar or daily planner | The app will not let me add to my calendar and I‚Äôm  a week out.  It would be nice to start planning this late into having to board the ship. | Drink packages are way overpriced | I am booked on a Royal Caribbean 9 night eastern Caribbean cruise leaving in 10 days. This cruise is not showing up on the RC app on my phone but it is on my ipad. Very frustrating. | Muy f√°cil y amigable | This app is so awesome. I love the communication feature on the app. You can communicate with your group or mate on the ship if you‚Äôre in different areas while at sea. Also you can book excursions and pay for any other services you may need ( eg. drink packages, internet etc. ) | We have taken 9 Royal cruises and enjoyed each one. We enjoy the Oasis class ships layout as there is so much to choose from for the entire family!  The food and entertainment is always over the top.
Best relaxing vacations out there!! | There should be an option to pay with cash once you check in not credit card only poor service on that part | Our room attendant, Elmer, he was absolutely amazing and was so wonderful to us and especially to our children!! He remembered all our names! 
Our dinnner table ( SILK table 807-Victor and Lax) waiters were also unbelievably great!! 10‚Äôs!!!‚Äîall across the board! Our daughters  and us will forever have the fondest memories because of these people! Thank you Royal Caribbean and to those special people üíôü§ç‚ù§Ô∏èüõ≥Ô∏è | This has been a great site for the family in planning and while we are on our cruise. Royal Caribbean does a very nice job or organizing things. This is why this is the third time we have done a Spring Break trip with them. | Does it | It‚Äôs a joke how bad this app is. | Just came back from a cruise on the 15th of March. Had an amazing time | The itineraries for the excursions should include all information from the start of the trip to the finish. For example, how far each destination is, and approximately how long you will be at each destination.
Also, reviews of each excursion fro clients that booked it.

PS Lose the nickname section because I tried 7 nicknames before any of them worked. | I cannot find even my room because your decks are incorrect!!!! I have cabin #8172. I went to deck 8, no number shown. My agent can see no problem! Fix this! | The app lacks lots of things but this key. | 10 min from drop off to board ship!   Fast fast fast | Difficult to find information regarding my upcoming cruise.  Can't even find what deck our room is on. | I am writing this review to express my dissatisfaction with the Royal Caribbean Line (RCL) App, which has significantly impacted my experience in a negative way. Despite the potential for a seamless and user-friendly digital interface, the app proves to be clumsy, awkward, and poorly laid out. Navigating through the app is far from intuitive, which makes what should be a straightforward process overly complicated and time-consuming.

Moreover, the app‚Äôs performance is below acceptable standards. It frequently freezes, which not only disrupts the user experience but also causes significant inconvenience, especially when trying to access critical information or services promptly. This issue seems to be compounded by the lackluster internet service provided, which far from meets the expectations set by today‚Äôs technological standards. The slow and unreliable connection adds to the frustration, making the use of the app more torturous than pleasurable.

The combination of these issues considerably detracts from the overall user experience and falls short of the high standards expected from a renowned company like Royal Caribbean. An app designed to enhance the customer‚Äôs experience should not be a source of stress or inconvenience. | Check in checked out how about keeping the app running to verify status | The phone app works.  I like having my planned sea day activities and excursions posted on the app ahead of the sail date. | App hardly stays connected. Rarely connects on cellular. Difficult to use prior to cruise for planning. | Well there be new features to this app I am looking for crown and anchor future So can add my on board preference Also see what my onboard benefits are Also see how many drinks I have left each day Also see menu from all restaurants before boarding so I can see if I want a specialty restaurant or not Also nice if it can save my personal information so I do not have to enter it for each cruise princes has it saved on there system witch makes it nice and fast I have those new futures can be added | This is our favorite cruise line. | Took my first cruise as a gift for our wedding anniversary. 
Turned out to be the best way to vacation. | Excellent service which you would expect. More importantly it was the above and beyond actions of the staff that helped us out. I am on insulin and when I got to Aruba, I found out that I had left my medication in the hotel before we got on board. The medical staff tracked down a source of my medication, and it was purchased at a very reasonable price and delivered to the ship!
The second was a little more mundane. I misplaced my glasses, left them at the pool area I thought, and after telling the guest services department, they had all the glasses that were lost sent there, and mine were in the ‚Äúpile‚Äù. 
Food was excellent , and the weight staff was very accommodating to some special requests. 
The chef in our section was excellent, we had made a comment about the French onion, soup, and in a polite way, was not a up to our taste ‚Äúbuds‚Äù. 
He made us a special batch for our table and I would have to say, and we have an experienced 3 star dining in New York City, the soup could compete with any of them.
Thank you Royal Caribbean for a wonderful experience. I am sure we will book another cruise based on the performance of the staff and crew in accommodating us. | Booked a cruise for 2025, I need to change the dates & ship but can‚Äôt find any dates that far out on here. Also being charged $100 per person to change & it‚Äôs a year from now, that‚Äôs ridiculous I don‚Äôt think I will ever cruise with Royal Caribbean ever again. Not very happy with this app or service I‚Äôm receiving or anything at all!!! | Made a mistake in the health questionnaire said I was pregnant won‚Äôt let me fix it | We are enjoying the meals, especially dinner on Royal Caribbean. We have cruised Disney, Princess and celebrity and food is best on Royal Caribbean. Service rated high too on these ships. We are going two times on Royal this year and have booked on the Icon for next March. | Having the app is handy having all of my information right at my fingertips. Having a search bar on the app would be very helpful instead of having to check every topic to find what I am specifically looking for. | I was very disappointed when I and my wife were there and told we couldn‚Äôt sail while we were there since 11;30 in the morning we had to wait and see everyone embarking with no food . For a small stipulation of residency card.  However my money was good for you guys to keep!! I‚Äôm a Florida resident and you guys still felt it was justified to take my money!! I want my money back or there is legitimate reasons for a class action suit.. how you respond will justify my reason! | I love technology‚Ä¶.when it works. Repeatedly, cruise goers are told to check-in as soon as possible. It‚Äôs particularly frustrating when the app fails and gives you pithy but useless error messages like ‚Äúcheck-in has checked-out. Try again later.‚Äù Can you imagine if the Southwest app regularly failed to allow flight check-ins? Do better RC. | We have sailed 15 cruises 12 on Carnival, 2 on Celebrity and now our First time on RC

The internet connection has been horrible. 
Paid for weekly use, try probably 10-15 times a day and only able to connect MAYBE 1 time a day for a few minutes then drop out. 

I have had to use my international roam rates with my own carrier to make required calls and have been charged $ 50 as of tonight. 

I should have cancelled your service on day 1. It is non functional from our state room, dinner lounge, or pool deck. 

Sign me up as extremely disappointed and ask for a full refund. Rob OBrien room 8564 
3/16-3/23

Please respond or this will be our last cruise on RC | This is my first review of an app, but this one is bad enough to warrant it. Know that your experience with the app will have a dramatic impact on your cruise since it‚Äôs one of the only ways to understand what‚Äôs going on during your vacation. 

I found the navigation very confusing and it isn‚Äôt always clear what is clickable or how specific information will be organized. Good example is kids club hours which isn‚Äôt listed under activities. When I did find the information it wasn‚Äôt accurate which I reported to guest services and it is evidentially up to the ship to keep updated. 

The chat function was persistently glitchy with some messages not appearing for everyone in our group or being very delayed and notifications were inconsistent. When it worked it was helpful, but hard to trust.

This feels like an app that was lead by the UX designers with very little input from the product or engineering orgs. For something this central to their guest‚Äôs experience it was very disappointing and I felt a step backwards from publishing the hard copy Cruise Compasses of the past.

Tip: if your ship keeps the same time zone as your departure port be sure to turn off automatic updates of time zones under General -> Date & Time -> Automatic Updates. This will save you a LOT of confusion and/or missed appointments with your phone being out of sync with ship time. Disappointing that this isn‚Äôt communicated more clearly or better yet suggested by an app notification. | The app is terrible. Trying to link reservations is not working at all neither do the drink packages‚Ä¶.. | This the first time I have planned to travel on Royal Caribbean and I am very disappointed with the service I have received with staff when trying to arrange dining with family etc.  As terrible as Norwegians reputation was/is.  I never had the issues as I have so far with Royal Caribbean.  I hope that I find service different once we are aboard. | I have called several times for help with different questions regarding our cruise and the customer service is always very helpful. | I reserved a cruise with two cabins, but only one cabin showed up in the app. And they are telling me to pay for the cruise on the app. Waited on the phone with them for 20 minutes for them to put it on the app, and the phone call got disconnected. Not sure if everything is paid for or not. Sigh. | Functions poorly most if the time. | Royal Caribbean is a Fortune 500 company‚Ä¶but this ISN‚ÄôT an application that reflects it! 
Royal Caribbean should seriously consider a major overhaul for this app! As a former spouse of an IT director at a Fortune 100 company, there are only two reasons for such a poor application. One, Royal does not invest enough in the IT department and it‚Äôs employees, or two, the IT department needs some better management. 
It is ridiculous passengers onboard cannot reserve spa appointments on the cruise they are on. 
But, the main complaint from the World cruisers is the speed of this App!! It‚Äôs painful SLOW!! UNACCEPTABLE!!
ROYAL CARIBBEAN‚Ä¶COME ON! YOU CAN AND SHOULD DO BETTER!! | The app is very user friendly and very helpful when it worked. However, while we were onboard, it was not reliable at all. At least 2 out of 3 times I tried to use it, it would not come up. I had purchased the internet package which you would think would help. Others in our party didn‚Äôt purchase the Internet package and the app was just as bad for them as it was for me. This is a very helpful tool to use while on your ship and even if nothing else worked on our devices, this should always be assessable. It helps you know what is going on or coming up next, helps you find your way around the ship if you get turned around and you can communicate with others in your party regardless of having purchased the WiFi package. I‚Äôve given it 2 instead of a 1 only because when it worked it was great. Overall very disappointing. | Great cruise line and great app Works great with your planning for your trip Can‚Äôt wait for our next trip in 4 weeks
Can‚Äôt wait to see Perfect Day new area | La mejor compa√±√≠a de cruceros. Los mejores! | Last September my family ( of 12 ) were booked on a Bermuda cruise. The night before Royal Caribbean announced that we would be going to Nova Scotia instead. Since we were looking forward to warm water & and sand, we canceled. Just a moment ago Royal Caribbean announced that the cruise destination for my upcoming trip on in April has changed.

It was much better to select the car we want, not to bring us any car they say for that we pay for a good, comfortable service | App missing feature available with online reservations like prepay. Prices through the app are generally higher for identical details.  App freezes and has bugs | It never works for advance check in | I am trying to book a rental car, but there is no option to use my Hertz points. So I have to pay.

It‚Äôs almost like you don‚Äôt want me to use them‚Ä¶  or maybe that‚Äôs the whole story.  Points that you can never use.

Collin | Utterly pathetic how unreliable this app is and has always been.  How can it not find my active rental even after entering the reservation number?  This has occurred numerous times while traveling in the US and Europe, never fixed by the dev team | Liam‚Äòs customer service was upset exceptional. Very informative very helpful. Wonderful asset to your company. Need more like him. | The title clearly states the dilemma, the dissatisfaction, the unrelenting effort on my part, as the customer being forced to use the app and being forced to do things on online. 
I had to repeatedly call for assistance and repeatedly. Keep at the process for three weeks before completing my effort. | Even for pay later rental | This hertz location always takes care of me! | I‚Äôm just trying to rent a car and avoid the counter. But, when I go to rent a car, it tells me that the prepaid option is not available. This obviously means I have to go to the counter. Aarrggghhh! So, then, to figure this out, I have to call Hertz. They have at least a 10 minute wait on hold to call them. And very annoying hold music. Aarrggghhh! What‚Äôs the deal? Don‚Äôt they want my business? | We were flying home from vacation and had to connect through DFW airport to get back to Oklahoma City. Our first flight was delayed meaning we were going to miss our home connection. So about four hours in advance and prior to landing in DFW I used the app to make a Hertz reservation with a pickup in DFW and drop off in Oklahoma City. The app accepted the reservation and credit card and gave me a confirmation. I went ahead and told the airline not to worry about re booking us as I was just going to get home that evening via a rented car and three hour drive. Hertz counter agent upon arrival told me they had no more one way vehicles available and I could not rent. How they would accept the reservation through the app and then not honor it is incredibly frustrating. There were a couple of other families on the same boat as me that evening. The app and rental centers obviously have a disconnect. Will try to avoid Hertz in the future. | Terrible equipment, inferior to most if not all other rental car agencies.  Checkout experience also a mess. | I have had multiple problems with both the app and website.  
I have tried multiple times to update my credit card but when I put in my new credit card it says the card is expired when it is not.  Now I can‚Äôt make a reservation.  

For an existing reservation I tried to use the app to modify. After I change my pick up time the app can‚Äôt load the next page and the update doesn‚Äôt go through.   

Simple request: make your website and app function correctly. | 1. could not update credit card information kept talking about must use date in the future.
2. I could not reach a human voice on the one 800 Hertz help number to remedy this. 
This is very disappointing of Hertz. Is it time to look for another rental car primary choice? | Terrible unfriendly site, and no service to support it.  As a premium gold member of Hertz it‚Äôs a waste of time to mess with the app or site.  Will join another program as a result | Excellent service. Am disabled so request driver to take us to airport as usual | The check in process is completely broken and repeatedly asks you to retake photos of your license and selfie. Infuriating. | Version 4.50.0 build 13 . Unlucky 14. Crashes and can‚Äôt open or open and it has error. Don‚Äôt download until fixed! | Stay away you will be over charged at the end of your lease for what ever reason worst company i ever dealt with | The mobile app was extremely easy to use, and I got a better deal than Priceline. | Love the company! | Easy and quick! | The app is not very well laid out. Trying to change corporate code or discount code entry is a challenge. I am trying to rent a car using points and still haven‚Äôt figured out how to do that. App definitely needs a rewrite. | The sign in page never works. Always ‚Äútechinxal problem with services‚Äù. This company is a joke | No cars at airport | ‚ÄúUpgraded‚Äù into car that the seat doesn‚Äôt go high enough for me.  No option given at time of making reservation for toll pass, no offer or reminder to get one when picking up rental. Tried calling customer service 3 times only to be hung up on repeatedly or no one answering. Tried modifying through hertz.com only to be told there was a page error 3/3 attempts. Trying to add a driver and get toll pass for rest of the week and I‚Äôm only 1 hr into my rental with no apparent options. Extremely dissatisfied with hertz.  Would appreciate an actual phone call to me at 978-836-7571 to get this rectified. Thank you, Tammy Belanger. | This app doesn‚Äôt work but neither does the website nor frankly, the service. Unable to make simple changes to profile and update contact information. Not able to request receipts. And if booked thru the site prices change when you pick up the vehicle. And when you request help the site crashes or sends you into an endless loop. | I have spent three hours online or on Hertz lame phone system for gold members.  terrible! | Not user friendly, unable to change account information and doesn‚Äôt allow all the options that website/ desktop offers. | Hertz works tries to make their rewards program sound appealing, but they put so many restrictions, the points are all but useless.  For example, you cannot rent a car for 7 days, pay for five with cash and then pay for two days with points.  Many locations don‚Äôt accept points.  Or they limit you to a one day points rental.  I‚Äôve been a gold member for 20+ years.  I‚Äôm tired of being treated so poorly.  I‚Äôll take my business elsewhere. | The Moment I got to ATL hertz location that had my car and they gave me a upgrade when I got back they filled up my car for free! I recommend using hertz | Just the worst customer service of all Companies | How am I supposed to rent the gold member section like I used to before Covid. What setting am I supposed to go with. | I had to enter my information on the site three times before if finally registered. Also, I wasn‚Äôt able to find the pay now rate on the app and had to reserve through the website. Not very well coordinated. | The ‚Äúforgot id‚Äù and ‚Äúforgot password‚Äù links just lead to error messages, and you‚Äôre unable to reset anything. | Love it‚Äôs easy pickup | I am a gold gold member and I had a reservation

Arrived and there are no cars and a lot of people waiting for cars

There‚Äôs a lot of options to choose from to rent cars

Don‚Äôt go with Hertz at Las Vegas | I‚Äôve never been able to use the app for the ‚Äútouchless rental experience‚Äù they advertise. Can‚Äôt log in half the time. Absolutely terrible app | Discounts very confusing. Say you can pick any car in presidential but don‚Äôt list them or categories. Should be honest and straightforward | Apple Pay tries to be the primary way of paying. | Looking at renting a car for Vegas. The cost on the app was $200 more than what the company website was. Do homework before renting | I‚Äôve tried calling and they keep hanging up before I can get to a person. So I downloaded the app. The app has no way to speak with customer service. I tried chatting outside the app and the response says not in service at this time. No mire Hertz for us. | App is unhelpful‚Äîcannot login and retrieve my reservation from Concur. The goal for downloading the app is for convenience, and it is not at all helpful for that. | It‚Äôs a wow experience as always. Highly recommended | Not so much the app, maybe bad data, but the initial price quote per week is no where near what the final per week cost is at check out so you have to start over. Make them match accurately!!! | Please stop pushing electric vehicles, add ons for ins and stuff and use of Apple Pay | Tried this app and website version and it just keeps spinning. Tried different devices , phones, desktops, dates etc. terrible and the developers need to fix it! | The rental reservation process is hard to follow and understand | App has never once worked.

Why not allow corrections?  This way your monthly and yearly totals are correct.  It‚Äôs not like this App has rankings or any competitive features.  The more you use the App the more you will hate it! | Wonderful for walking and relationships | I had fell for the free trial period and honestly hadn‚Äôt even been on a trail or outdoors to even get any use of this app ! Beware after you add the free trial it will charge you without a way or place look yourself were you can unsubscribe before the date ! You can only cancel but even then it tells you that a payment will not be stopped! I have screenshots backing this up what I‚Äôm saying! They need to make it easier to undo this trick in there app ! You can only email them ! I have emailed them almost begging them to drop me at this time ! I‚Äôm sure the app would be awesome to use as I can‚Äôt say but would assume it‚Äôs an awesome app of your using it ! However I have not seen one email back ! I have had to block them and then it still is going through under google now and I don‚Äôt have any saved payments through google that I can see ! Now I know they receive the emails and this has been days I‚Äôve tried to under this asking them if they can possibly look as this is app can see location based info right ? Again I haven‚Äôt used this app at all but the features they say that they carry seems like it would be an awesome experience! And if I‚Äôd not had my acct acct hit more times than I can speak in more than one way ! Long after I‚Äôve put in my response saying I‚Äôve never used this however the payment keeps trying to come through! The only place I see is to ask for a payment back ! To say it‚Äôs free and then only have a cancel section and no unsubscribe is frankly well you all look for yourself! I get if I‚Äôd used this ! But how in the future I‚Äôd love to use this app ! But no way will I trust this till I see they update so you can truly have the option so they can‚Äôt just bill and take your $ ! This is sad truly ! I am honestly after this experience never going to trust a free trial through these apps again! Sadly not all apps are so $ hungry and tricky ! Some how this payment isn‚Äôt showing up on my acct subscription through Apple other wise Apple has the ability to help solve nasty issues like this ! I honestly have a child that I think added this and I even told them that and she is under the age they say is liable to even use this app ! But again in the future unless I can see that there system is set easily to cancel and unsubscribe so they can‚Äôt keep billing you almost 40$ too that‚Äôs a high price for an app that hasn‚Äôt even been used ! Now ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Please respond to my emails I‚Äôll send one more this last time and after that I‚Äôm seeking legal help now I‚Äôve tried every way I can see to undo this ! I have given every email I can imagine that might be linked under this and have all but given my own personal telephone number which I will do one last time ! I‚Äôm done rambling on but it‚Äôs all facts ! So fix it or beware I pray others don‚Äôt have the problem like I have for now sending multiple emails and can‚Äôt get through to anyone! Thanks but no thanks ! Again till they fix this issue ! Beware! Try it for yourself and find where when you try to cancel what it says ! They have to even aprove that ! And then you can see the app but it try‚Äôs to con you back into signing back up ! I refuse to do that ! I pray the developer will fix this issue and recreate so one can have better options and respond to emails and stop the billing payments! Good luck to anyone who might try to download this and look for yourself and see find the option to to unsubscribe! How they keep billing me idk I haven‚Äôt found it and I keep begging them and still right now I beg you help me resolve my issue trying to stop being billed for a service I‚Äôve never used let alone can‚Äôt undo on the $ issues ! Thanks a lot ! | Love this app! Especially when I‚Äôm visiting a new place to hike, the reviews and ratings of the trails are helpful in picking what I want to do for the day and what matches my level of activity the best. | Buy subscription on AllTrails website then app doesn‚Äôt acknowledge.  Need to fix app.  Only wants you to buy through Apple Store with the higher price.  Terrible service | I absolutely love this app I found so many trails for me and my family and perfect fishing spots thank you all trails | AllTrails charged me through PayPal somehow, and did not notify me that they would do so until the day of the charge. They insist it was charged through Apple, but I have provided receipts show it did not do so. Customer service is now ignoring me and my request for a refund.

Update: they responded finally, only to tell me they can‚Äôt find my account and to dispute through PayPal. Thanks I guess? | Helps me track how far i can run and calculate the time i run as well, great app tracking my fitness progress | Don‚Äôt use push notifications for advertising. Immediate 1 star review and removal from phone | Hello

Yesterday, Sunday March 24th your app had a 50% off annual renewal button showing when I was deciding to re up my account. I thought that the 17$ fee was a fair price so I chose to rejoin your app. 

I hit the 50% off button to rejoin but your app charged me the full price of 34$. 

Please refund me either the 50% I was overcharged or the entire price I was charged. Right now I feel cheated / fooled into using the discount button your app showed on screen. 

Thank you

Kyle | I‚Äôve been a paid user of AllTrails for several years, but the last six or so months has seen the app lose features, become harder to use, or be outright not useful on the trail. I can no longer search my lists for specific trails and can only use map view or scroll (good luck with lists with more than ten trails)! Lifeline feature changed recently, and for the worst (can‚Äôt send to multiple individual numbers anymore, have to go back to enter end time, no customizable texts, and my partner said she had to log in to see a lot of info), after they kept moving where it was found in Navigate. Elevation profile is wrong when navigating and will frequently show elevation numbers increasing but the graphing will show decreasing. Pausing navigation reset all my stats mid hike. I am unable to click on park names on trails pages to jump to a trail list in that park. UX changes have option clusters broken up inexplicably. The new trail conditions info on the page almost never has useful options. And the classic: trail lengths are almost never right, usually short by about 10%. It‚Äôs almost as if there‚Äôs no QA team at all anymore, and the devs don‚Äôt use their app. Really disappointed in the changes in AllTrails lately and am now looking for alternatives. | you have to pay if you want a trail closer than 60 miles to you and if you do get a trail close enough it‚Äôs heavily crowded and bans dogs from the trail (the advertisement for this app was trails for leashed dogs) | If you love the outdoors and adventure it‚Äôs a must have. It‚Äôs worth upgrading and paying for the one year subscription. | Love the app but dislike pop-ups. I pay for premium but still get pop ups asking me to review the trail and post to social media for every activity I record. I repeat a lot of the same trails every week so it doesn‚Äôt benefit the community to repeat reviews. But it makes the app frustrating to use. | I was charged the full price for this app. | I would. My wife hikes and uses this app and it works for her purpose. I only signed up to follow her on a hike, can‚Äôt understand why a free version couldn‚Äôt serve this purpose but I had to sign up for a 1 ur subscription. I selected the option to notify me to cancel before being charged. Not only did the follow feature give me ZERO alerts during her hike, I never got notified until I was charged $35.99 for a useless subscription. Thanks for absolutely nothing. | Oh yeah | Great app in almost every way. But every single page load gets another pop up ad to subscribe. I‚Äôll deal with it, but the ‚Äúannoy them til they subscribe‚Äù is a strange strategy | Good for the most part. BUT‚Ä¶ pause and resume DOES NOT MEAN pause, delete all activity so far, reset everything to zero and then start over.  This was infuriating in the middle of a long hike‚Ä¶ | So I been using this app for quite a while now. I‚Äôve been having some problems as of late and it‚Äôs been frustrating because I use this app on a daily basis, multiple times a day it keeps losing track of my progress. it‚Äôs pausing on its own when I have have not asked it to stop, can you please fix this? | All Trails has helped me find the best trails but also is indispensable for staying on the trail and not getting lost.  On just about every hike I do, I‚Äôm having to help out someone who got lost and tell them to use All Trails. | AllTrails has opened up an entirely new world to me within the area I live. I‚Äôve always enjoyed being outdoors in nature but I have generally kept to what I know when it comes to exploring. To have so many options exposed via this app in such short distances to me, I have found a much grander appreciation for where I call home (The Berkshires, Massachusetts). I use AllTrails daily and truly get excited every time I open the app to see what is out there that I‚Äôve never experienced before. | I love the map search feature. All in all it‚Äôs a great app. | I like how it keeps track of where you are during the hike even with bad signal | We use All Trails all of the time for hiking. It helps us narrow down our trails by using the different preferences.  Sometimes the lengths are off.  We have learned to look at the other posts of that trail to make sure of more accurate distance.  We use it in all of our travels.  No matter where we are. | It‚Äôs literally the best app ever for trails, love it!!! | Love the app. Just want to have the option of showing Time remaining and mileage left when hiking. | All Trail has helped me find some really awesome walks and rides but every time I‚Äôve used it on trails where cell coverage is patchy at best, the app crashes and I have to restart the tracking. 

I really think this is because it doesn‚Äôt cache the trail locally which should be a simple fix. If it drops signal, it should check the cache and resume as soon as coverage returns. 

Its EXTREMELY frustrating to lose your tracking. You now dont know how far to go and you lose all your fitness stats too..

Also I‚Äôd love it to show my heart rate on Apple watch.

Furthermore I want to be able to use it on my Cellular Apple Watch WITHOUT having to have my phone with me too. Checking I‚Äôm on trail with a quick glance to my watch would be stellar. 

Great potential but a few niggly annoyances. | Looks like the marketing department is in charge, tons of nagging prompts that are constantly popping up, and have to be dismissed. I‚Äôm a paying user and yet I‚Äôm forced to see marketing EVERYTIME I use the app. One star because of this garbage, developers‚Ä¶ get rid of the marketing genius at your company, they are hurting the app! | ‚Ä¶for finding where to go, what to expect, less chance of being disappointed, having a blast, and getting home safe.  Also, sharing your experiences visually, in written language and help others. | 3rd party sharing is NOT OK! Its super annoying when an app asks for a review each and every time you go for a run or hike.STOP! Much better and cheaper options available on itunes without giving away your privacy. | Great app, easy to get started. Simple to use | I love this app | They make it too easy to ""subscribe"" and too hard to cancel it | Please add a ""for some reason the government decided to charge money to go outside here"" check box to avoid capitalist greed march trails. | I love this app. I use it all the time for hiking and backpacking. Love the ability to download maps so if I don‚Äôt have service I can still track where I am on or off the trail. 

I do wish it gave information on whether and or where you are aloud to camp. I want to find places to go for close one night weekend trips but when I select backpacking it gives me parks and trails I know do not allow over night camping. Not I big deal but would be very convenient to know if I‚Äôm allowed to camp. | I‚Äôm in an area I know well so I didn‚Äôt worry. I was trying out the app and it couldn‚Äôt get me back on track until I was over a mile off. Not happy. Won‚Äôt be renewing subscription | I have always struggled taking the initiative to do something.  I decided I wanted to start hiking and got this app, it removed ALL the friction in finding a good hike!  I recommend the subscription so you can download your maps too.

The only thing to note is that it doesn‚Äôt have all hikes you may look for but it can track a blank trip and you can name it as that hike so you have a guide next time‚Ä¶ | Doesn‚Äôt share all the information of the hike with Apple Health. Like I wanna see the route I took in the Apple Fitness app and I can‚Äôt. Not even average pace? No way it‚Äôs that hard to implement. | Never experienced bugs while using this app, always smooth to load, will keep using for years! | Great app.  Idk why it gets so much flak in some outdoorsy spaces - for the most hikers, the selection of maps available and the intuitive design of the app make it a better choice than other apps.  Subscription for offline map features is cheap and worth it even if you rarely use it.  But it‚Äôd be nice if it was slightly easier to make your own map based off existing maps. | I‚Äôm a hiker in the Pacific Northwest.  There are a lot of trails this app simply doesn‚Äôt cover.  They rely on subscribers to submit them. | Really loving the new additions to the app! AllTrails is great. | Short and sweet: how is there not an iPad version of the app? I understand that people aren‚Äôt hiking with their tablets in their hands, but for browsing and planning, it would be great to have an app optimized for the iPad. | The app has official government website addresses in the descriptions of some trails, but they aren‚Äôt hyperlinked and they cannot be selected and copied within the app. AllTrails continues to thoroughly impress with their unthoughtfulness and poor design. | helps me explore new areas in a beautiful way! love this app so much. | I‚Äôve been using AllTrails for a couple of weeks. I love being able to plan my hike in advance and share it with my route and progress with my coach and friends and a couple of emergency contacts.

My one problem is that there are not always the artists I listen to on here not a single song!
Idk if it is possible to add more songs..but It would be great if you could! | Amazing for trips and adventures | Best app I‚Äôve ever used, it works on airplane mode you can use it anywhere it‚Äôs just the best! | ~ 9r@c!@$ TREBEL FOR FREEZING MY c0n+!+u‚Ç¨n+$ FROM JOINING ME WITH REAL MUSIC READY TO SHARE‚Ä¶n0w WHO !z 0 !zN mY c0n$+!+u‚Ç¨n+$‚Ä¶üòéüí´‚ôèÔ∏è | Perfect!!! I can listen the music anytime when my internet is off‚Ä¶ | This music app allows you to listen to music offline and works fast. | It‚Äôs a good app get it üëçüèæ | The only app I found that truly let u listen to your tracks offline. Nice | I have been wanting to find a free app for a long time, after searching Google finally recommended Trebel. I thought it was another one like the others, that is, they tell you it's free and then they give you a few days to subscribe. I am very happy with Trebel. I hope to continue enjoying it and I am very grateful to the Trebel team. | Everything is great! I can download albums and songs offline and all that stuff. The only thing I notice is when I go and play the songs they sorta sound like they‚Äôre playing out of a tin can‚Ä¶ so if they could fix that it would be AMAZING! Otherwise great app üëç | But there‚Äôs one problem I have with this app and the problem is sometimes when I gain coins I lose them next time I open the app and I even lose them when I listen to a song I downloaded please fix this bug thanks again to the makers of this app üòÅ | Soups perfect don‚Äôt even have a SIM card in my phone but I can still play music once it‚Äôs downloaded !!! | I was solely a YouTube junkie I never had another music platform but this one is way worth any other you can play guess that song and win cool points thank you Trebleüíï | Amazing. I ‚ù§Ô∏èthis app.  My favorite feature is playing music üé∂ in my car without using my data.  Thank you. | So much better than paying for something like Spotify premium/ subscriptions. | Very good app, thanks for a option to skip the ads | one bad thing i have is idk don‚Äôt how to download videos on the app | it may not have all the songs from all bands. but i do wish future updates will bring in all songs to be downloadable for those who liked the songs from the full albums | This app does what it says perfect. | TREBEL has Been good to me when I‚Äôm not at home it still works best ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•‚ù§Ô∏èüî•‚ù§Ô∏èüî• | The app is trash I had everything download it and wanted me to re-download it so I recommend nobody to download is it is trash and garbage | I would totally recommend this to teens who go on long trips by car and plane | So easy to download songs. Love it! | It is basically Spotify premium for free but you have to have coins to play music and they give you 50-99 coins per free daily drop! | It‚Äôs a really good app. Nothing negative to say!!! | This app is amazing, theres nothing more to say, it‚Äôs the first music app I could use for FREE to listen to music on airplane mode, I was looking for music apps that could work on the airplane since I was going to travel, and this app works great, yes it may have a lot of adds but it‚Äôs totally worth it, it‚Äôs free and works on airplane mode which most music apps don‚Äôt without premium, it doesn‚Äôt have much variety of songs but it is still great for what it was made for. | I have no problem with the app but I wish I could download more then one song at a time. | No tiene casi anuncios como Spotify | No explanation needed this app is great | This music app is the best one I had because it has every song you can think of like Morgan wallen and everyone else | From one to 10:10 | Finally an app that i can actually use for times without wifi | Just download it thank us later ‚ò∫Ô∏è | This app is need update for the latest music out | (IF you HAVE IPHONE THIS IS THE APP FOR YOU!!!)
 
 Since i were thankfully introduced to Treble my life was able to balance itself tremendously. Through music of course! Music can be very therapeutic and much more, it is for me. | Some songs that were downloaded are playing a totally different song and artist. | I really like it,I have been using this since I came here to Florida. But the thing that I don‚Äôt like is that the coins finish too fast and sometimes happen that the music takes off alone. I don‚Äôt know how to make more coins‚Ä¶but the good thing is that I really like more this app more than Spotify | I am on my IPad and I was just on the app and noticed that the pause button is not working when I push it. I start playing a song and it will not respond. Please fix. | Have hopscotched between my IPad and IPhone just to accommodate the room of my downloads! Of course, phone is preferable, as to have good music in rotation with minimal advertisements, aside from downloading‚úÖ 

Supremely Accommodating and Tailored! 

All Praise Chiefly To The Grand Composer, J.G Almighty!ü§ó(JW.ORG)üèû | It‚Äôs soo much better then Spotify because there is not much ads but in Spotify has I would recommend this appüëçüèª‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | There‚Äôs almost no ads you can skip for free and get every song you want it‚Äôs so much better than Spotify | Great app I use it everyday and the ads are the only thing that are a problem | I have no complaints about this app. It is a very useful app and very good for downloading music that you want to listen to and in my opinion I love the app and people who don‚Äôt have it should really get it. | If you don‚Äôt have coins you get an ad after every song which I think is stupid plus they don‚Äôt even have any good songs all the songs I want to download aren‚Äôt available for download or they just don‚Äôt have some artists on the app at all not even a single song from them and the music you download from YouTube doesn‚Äôt even play offline | I love how I get to choose any song that I want and I don‚Äôt really care for the adds as long as I get to listen to my favorite songs while offline. There are so many songs to choose from and there are 5 boosters that I don‚Äôt even need to watch an add for! I recommend this app because I went on a 12 hour trip in the car and I wasn‚Äôt bored because I had this app! You can use it anytime and I love it a lot! This is why I carry my headphones and my phone with me everywhere! | I got this app so that I can play music off-line for my mother who has dementia and his bedridden. But she loves her music so when we‚Äôre at the doctors office, riding in the car, or just being at home, me and her we play music. The only problem I‚Äôve had with this app is that sometimes I select the song but it plays a different song than I selected. Thanks to the people at TREBEL far allowing me to comfort my mom towards the end of her life. | I have a TREBEL pass that I am paying for and it said that you get  unlimited  and no adds but somehow there are ads when I am paying for unlimited. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm pager something that I‚Äôm not getting. | The best app for music by far but wish there was more OUIJA MACC songs please or underground

It has a lot of guidance BUT the map can get pretty confusing sometimes. | Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è | This is so Funnn I love this app so much thank you universal studios Hollywood for bring me joy üòÅ | Se tardan mucho los juegos | This is a review on the APP, not the park.      
 
The app is fantastic. I can see wait times, view restaurants, create an account, and view my annual pass. I can also see my SUPER NINTENDO WORLD at Universal Studios Hollywood badges and achievements clearly in the built-in mini-app, and switch between SUPER NINTENDO WORLD at Universal Studios Hollywood accounts. However, there is no link to book a time to join the queue for Toadstool Cafe. Instead, I either have to go the park and scan the QR code near the entrance to either SUPER NINTENDO WORLD or Toadstool Cafe, or watch a YouTube video of someone getting near the QR code and scan it in the video to book at home before I enter the park. In my opinion, allowing guests to book beforehand via a link in the app will reduce stress and time-slots for the day filling up by the time you scan. For example, I can book Saturday at 1:00 P.M. on Friday at home via the in-app link, versus scanning at either entrance on Saturday and realizing all times are filled up that day.

There are other minor inconveniences with app. Otherwise, it‚Äôs great.

Esta es una revisar en la APP, no en el parque.
 
La aplicaci√≥n es fant√°stica. Puedo ver tiempos de espera, ver restaurantes, crear una cuenta y ver mi pase anual. Tambi√©n puedo ver mis insignias y logros de SUPER NINTENDO WORLD en Universal Studios Hollywood claramente en la miniaplicaci√≥n incorporada y cambiar entre cuentas de SUPER NINTENDO WORLD en Universal Studios Hollywood. Sin embargo, no hay ning√∫n enlace para reservar una hora para unirse a la cola de Toadstool Cafe. En lugar de eso, tengo que ir al parque y escanear el c√≥digo QR cerca de la entrada de SUPER NINTENDO WORLD o Toadstool Cafe, o ver un video de YouTube de alguien acerc√°ndose al c√≥digo QR y escanearlo en el video para reservar en casa antes de entrar al parque. En mi opini√≥n, permitir que los hu√©spedes reserven con anticipaci√≥n a trav√©s de un enlace en la aplicaci√≥n reducir√° el estr√©s y reducir√° los horarios del d√≠a que se llenan cuando escaneas. Por ejemplo, puedo reservar el s√°bado a la 1:00 p. m. del viernes en casa a trav√©s del enlace de la aplicaci√≥n, en lugar de escanear en cualquiera de las entradas el s√°bado y darme cuenta de que todos los horarios est√°n llenos ese d√≠a.

Hay otros inconvenientes menores con la aplicaci√≥n. De lo contrario, es genial. | We all hade fun | I can‚Äôt purchase parking tickets | Half the menu is not on the app. This makes it a waste of time. | Need blackout dates for digital tickets‚Ä¶ so we know when not to go | The food I ordered thru the app was complete however I was never notified thru app to pick up.  I eventually made my way down to pickup food not knowing food was ready for pick up. | Our family had the best time. If you are there for the interactive band make sure you tape at least twice so you can get the stamps and keys or you‚Äôll have to wait in line and do it all over again | This is an absolute joke of an amusement park, if you can even call it that. 12 total attractions throughout the entire park, and TWO rollercoasters. And I had to pay $144 for a day. You‚Äôre better off just getting a season pass at Six Flags for less than half the price, and you‚Äôll get a heck of a lot more rollercoasters there. Only reason Universal gets a lot of foot traffic is because they‚Äôre fricking Universal; they can get away with anything. | Took my son to Mario bros and it was closed he was so sad ü•πand fast and furious not in service also üò° drive from far away for this bad experience | The Mario cart ride broke down and now I‚Äôm stuck sitting here in this tight space while I‚Äôm claustrophobic and they won‚Äôt let my family and I go out and walk to the exit the their for this ride is not the best this in my opinion was a great concept but they failed to execute it | Crumby app forces you to turn on notifications or you can‚Äôt use it.  I don‚Äôt want to see your ad solicitations - surely this is a breach of Apple policy?

Stop it or shut this app down. | We love it here.! It‚Äôs the best.! Had to renew our passes and now we are back.! | This will be my first time to California because normally I visit Orlando Florida. I was born in Miami Florida and I have a Cuban half Cuban half Puerto Rican friend from Miami that moved to Los Angeles California in Pasadena California. And again, this would be my first time to visit California. | Nice and easy to use. | Missing basic mapping features and help/chat is not very helpful.
Filtering would benefit from walking with first time guests 
Activity Suggestions would be helpful to manage / balance park loads and better engage users | You should hire someone who knows terms like usability, business processes, user stories, and best practices. This is a completely inconvenient, ill-conceived application. Overloaded interface, everything is extremely confusing and completely unintuitive with a lot of bugs. It is not clear how it was tested and released into production. Do you like this product yourself? Great park but the app is really bad. | üçîüç¶üç®ü•≥üòÑüòçüçïüçùüç∞üéÇüòÅüçøüçü | 1.

2. Leave the phone alone so the phone auto locks the screen

This will make the display brightness go down to 0%. 

This has made my phone impossible to use until I went into a deem-lit store without sunlight. Worst bug to have when you are in line at the park gate with so much sunlight. | Rides are all broken. Money is stolen for services not provided and app fails to warn users. Useless app. Probably another thing made in america | Bad app | üü•üü•üü•‚¨ú‚¨úüü•üü•üü• üü•üü•üü•‚¨ú‚¨úüü•üü•üü• üü•üü•üü•üü•üü•üü•üü•üü• üèª‚¨úüü¶üèªüèªüü¶‚¨úüèª üèª‚¨úüü¶üèªüèªüü¶‚¨úüèª üü´üèªüèªüèªüèªüèªüèªüü´ üü´üü´üèªüèªüèªüèªüü´üü´ üèª‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨õ‚¨õüèª | Upgraded ticket to annual pass try to make park reservations never works just a scam unethical business practices. | This app makes everything more difficult, some rides are only by virtual appointment. Which is ridiculous.
They make you download the app to get in the park. And they don‚Äôt let you know about the way that I virtual appointments only. | I want to come back there for real. I hope I get to see you again Universal Studios I miss you thank you Universal Studios. I‚Äôll see you at home right now. I really want you to come. I wish you was Universal Studios here. what are you have to travel back? I wish you didn‚Äôt have to do that. I wish there was a universal studios here. I‚Äôll see you guys again promise and thanks for the ride with you. I love the water was the best place. Thank you 
Love you guys I hope I see you again promise
Bye-bye, love you guys I‚Äôll see you again later in the year again I hope you guys have the best best new year. Have a nice time. I like it there I want to come back and thank you Universal Studios.
I really like the way that you made the place my favorite one most favorite favorite favorite one was the Harry Potter. That was the best one. Mostly I want I want to do the Harry Potter win again I also like the transform one that was very that was really like. Emotion I really like the place I just really want to come back and my last one that I really really liked was the Jurassic Park. That was the one that I really liked it was the best one ever. I hope you guys love the place I love you guys. I‚Äôll come back I promise OK I‚Äôll see you guys . | ee | It is a really good app because you can know how long the wait times are for every single ride and they kind of show us what foods we can eat, and and we can also check what time they close and open | Sussy Baka | This app is garbage. It always failed when I tried to link the ticket. The estimated wait time is not accurate all the time too. Garbage | We have been trying to use the app to schedule activities and it just isn‚Äôt working. | This is the best app ever if you are going to universal studios! This app and park is amazing! | This is really useful but I wish there was more to it | When you are entering the ticket number to link it to your account, you can‚Äôt copy and paste it. | What an absolutely badly designed application. Y‚Äôall charge us all that money to visit and this is the app you guys had made? | I love this app because I can see how long the wait times are and I can see restaurants! | I like to go on all the ride like the Simpsons the Jurassic World and everything | The app is requesting a bar code the tickets have a QR code | I love this app because I give it a star! | I love everything about this place! I have been to several surrounding parks, but never this one. It looks so amazing! Especially the Harry Potter Two Worlds! I am excited to finish planning this trip for family and friends. These memories truly last forever, and I hope to revisit at least one a year in the future, until the day I die! | I had sent an email. And the customer support completely voided my pass. Something is very sketchy about that. I wouldn‚Äôt put my money towards a business like this. Customer support is HORRIBLE. | It‚Äôs so fun and I bet every child will love it | I would put 5 stars but I‚Äôm getting annoyed that my itinerary is NOT saving the order I‚Äôm putting it at. What is the point of editing the list and organizing it when it just resets back when I save it. It‚Äôs ANNOYING. | Very good | This app helps me know information around the park at universal studios it it a useful tool | No one told us we need an ADA pass when we have a mobility issue and use a scooter. Now we have to go all the way back to the entrance to request one. Taking a lot of our park time away. | I‚Äôm an experienced software tester and this is quite possibly the worst user experience I‚Äôve ever had with an application.  Nothing in the app seems to work at all. I tried to log in.  It fails. I‚Äôve attempted this 4 times.  

I tapped the wallet option. The app crashes hard. No reason. I didn‚Äôt even bother trying the other features of the app because the main things I needed to do couldn‚Äôt be done on the app. 

The website seems to okay but that has bugs too.  I tried to create an account on the site. The site threw an error. Then I received an account created email. That makes no sense in my opinion. 75% of the code doesn‚Äôt work, but the send user an email does? 

Whoever is in charge of the testing teams needs to consider trying something else because this is ridiculous. You pushed an update 6 days ago and the mobile app is this buggy? How did you miss this? 

Thank god the website has some functionality or this process would have been impossible.

Although app is good but there are few bugs that need to be fixed. First name only accept few characters. I have a big first name and it did not fit on the first name input box. 

Second issue with date of birth field. It shows date of birth selected one day before the actual date of birth. If I enter 01/18/1999 input box shows 1/17/1999.

I always have to end up checking in at the airport in person. What‚Äôs the purpose of an app?

Yep used to be good prior to the pandemic. Now I get the messages in German difficult to find the English translations. And they require scanning of Covid vaccination documents. I can‚Äôt find the place where to scan it the directions are in German. I will start beginning to fly United or another carrier.

Great airline, lousy tech | Flight delayed by two hours,spent 30 minutes stuck in the airplane on the tarmac because there was no gate for us after our 10 hour flight.Had an obnoxiously long bus ride to the gate to get to Warsaw.I think Germans are just terrible at being on time,organized and have little to no idea what they‚Äôre doing.Hmmm,maybe that‚Äôs why they lost the war ü§î | I had a tight connection from Munich to the US and the agent very helpfully made a change to send my bag all the way through. | The option to buy checked luggage is very hidden during the check in process. Moreover once found it doesn‚Äôt work. After clicking on it it keeps looping forever on the check in steps never reaching the point where the user can actually buy the luggage | Crazy. How can an App require this much code? Or is this all just useless junk? | I cannot even begin to express how disappointed I am in the app and it‚Äôs inability to update quickly especially when one has a connecting flight with only a few moments to spare. This is an absolute atrocity to travelers everywhere. Not only does the app not update, it barely ever opens properly. Just Yeesh all around. | I travelled from Miami to Hyderabad with Lufthansa airlines to attend my friends wedding. My first layover was in Munich and second layover was in Bangalore. 
My customs was in Bangalore. I reached Bangalore and was waiting for baggage at Bangalore and realized that my both baggages were left behind in Munich. 

I was told that I can pick them up in Hyderabad airport after 2 days. 
I had to redo my shopping for wedding which costed me bucks. 
And when I got a call from Lufthansa that I can pick up my luggage at Hyderabad airport, I was kept waiting for 3 hours at airport before I can pick my baggage. 

I wasted my valuable money and time because of Lufthansa‚Äôs fault. | Endless walking around, bus to plane on tarmac, not heated, hundreds of steps - not great

Phl to fra - only 2 bathrooms for business and premium eco is not enough. BA and AA have both superior business class experience | I can‚Äôt begin to thank you enough for the service and the attention received  flying from LAX to Munich. on your beautiful A380-800. Getting to meet the Captain in first class before we took off was a delight ! Especially since my husband is a retired 747-400 United pilot !! 
Your plane was immaculate, and your stuff staff is totally nice and so caring & always  smiling. I‚Äôve never seen flight attendants so pleasant !! 
We have flown Emirates first class and many other Airlines first class but by far your pleasant flight attendants, and everyone that served us in first class was totally amazing will not be forgotten!! 
Thank you again for an amazing trip and for the upgrade to first class!! 
We will definitely be back!! 
Best regards, 
Barbara McKay | The GOAT of all airlines I‚Äôve traveled 

1. Super Friendly staff
2. Well maintained planes
3. Extremely comfortable seats (regardless of class on airplane)
4. Tons of flying destinations | We could not get our boarding passes downloaded.  When I finally got the boarding pass to download it just disappeared could not find it anywhere.  The app kept saying it was saved to the app but could not find it anywhere on the app. | Their app and website change mood in time. Most of the time I can‚Äôt login with my account credentials. Both the website and app aren‚Äôt intuitive as if their codes were written by an amateur. | No boarding pass regardless of how many times checking in with success. No boarding pass emailed. Buggy and slow and always stuck. | The categories are very well organized. From the day before check-in (terminal, counter numbers‚Ä¶), boarding, to baggage claim, every step is clearly displayed with details. There are no confusing choices like some other airlines. | I‚Äôm very happy with Lufthansa. But please please please get rid of Sun Express! I don‚Äôt even know how you‚Äôre a partner with them! Planes are too small. Service is not good. Even if I want a water they charge for it when it says ‚Äúfood included the ticket price‚Äù! | First, I‚Äôm going to add two updates to my below review, then you can read said review because all of that negative feedback still stands:
1) I was sent a pin to ‚Äúreset‚Äù my account to my email address.  I received the email, reset my pin, and received a confirmation email.  Then I went to login and the website got a message saying either my email or password is wrong but, like in the below review, it doesn‚Äôt say which one.  I clicked on the password reset button and it said I would receive an email but never received one‚Ä¶.FIVE TRIES!!!
2) Your website says the best way to get in touch with customer service is trough chat but doesn‚Äôt provide a number or a link.  

Every time I open this I can‚Äôt login in. It continually tells me that my password or email is wrong. HAVE YOUR DUMB ALGORITHM SAY WHICH IS WRONG!!! It also doesn‚Äôt provide a link to get a new password‚Ä¶ Oh but wait, it‚Äôs the app that‚Äôs actually wrong! Login/password are ok, I just have to delete and reload the app then it‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶..until I close it!!!!   When I close the app then open it again, same stupid problem. Just give United more control over checking in and choosing seats/upgrades on your parther flights. They have their ‚Ç¨&$# together! After two years of using this terrible app it‚Äôs clear you have a long long long way to go. I will never know though, because this time it‚Äôs permanently deleted!

The only reason I use Lufthansa is because it is partnered with United.  Luckily there are thousands of us petitioning United to decouple from this terrible airline. | Best service | The Lufthansa app is the poorest performing app. None of my past nor upcoming flights show. No ability to checkin. I tried the app, the internet, and even the chat feature (a joke). Called Lufthansa and the representative could not assist me and directed me to call another number for assistance checking in. That number was for internet issues and was closed as it was Saturday. I called again and was told I would need to checkin in person. Mind you, this was all the result of Lufthansa canceling my  connecting flight WHILE I WAS MID-AIR flying from Venice to Frankfurt. The connecting flight from Frankfurt to EWR was cancelled last minute due to a ‚Äústaffing shortage.‚Äù They rebooked for the next day meaning my flights home from EWR to Colorado were impacted (separate ticket) so now I‚Äôm stuck paying an additional $603 to rebook my flight home from EWR to Colorado. | The app would seem fine except I can‚Äôt check into a flight! It thinks a 9-digit US passport is invalid. Unbelievable. And I had the same problem even at the flight desk so the app must be backed by the same crappy system. It shouldn‚Äôt require going to the airport and getting the attention of a manager to check in to a flight. | I‚Äôve never had any luck getting this app to work over the 3 yrs I‚Äôve tried. Ex: It makes you check in to get  boarding passes even if you‚Äôve checked in at the counter or online. Then after ‚Äúdownloading the boarding passes to the app‚Äù, it makes you check in again to see them. Never got that to work - dropped back to paper.  It consumes enormous battery. Started with 95% and after 30 min of struggling above I‚Äôm at 85% (only app running).  Travelers are better off with paper tickets and boarding passes than this app.  There are other issues but this is a start. | You can reach anyone and apps has a lot of errors. | Traveling internationally from Munich to India, I was able to put in my passport and visa information and voila I got my boarding pass.  I wasn‚Äôt checking any baggage so I was able to avoid all lines and go straight to security.  Absolutely loved the process! | Cankot checkin to US flight with green card. Automated kiosks in Munich airport don't have Green Card option, only Visa is showing up and Green Card details are not accepred. | Super up to date infos! Would highly recommend. #thumbsup | This app is completely broken and essentially unusable, and the Lufthansa customer service is just as bad.

Just about every function is met with ‚ÄúDue to technical reasons (this function) cannot be accessed.‚Äù

When you call, they literally say, ‚ÄúThere are no technical issues on the app or website.‚Äù

This app deserves 0 stars. | The years of flying has its advantages. You guys know how to manage people and flights. 
Thank you | On the way to Sicily you were so late out of ORD we had to charter a plane from FRA to get to our friends on time in PAL, on the way home you are so late on PAL-MUC that  I am unsure we will make our flight MUC-ORD.  Not at all up to my expectations nor your standards.  I‚Äôm a very disappointed customer.  Mario b | Convenient to book a flight, but for the rest of your needs, not so.I can't find  and use my miles and more points, can't check the balance nor I can use upon check out.Can't find the baggage receipt in the app, thanks they e-mail it.If you rebook your flight, you can't check-in 24h prior your flight in the app.Even the app shows your new reservation, it doesn't recognize your booking code or ticket number and becomes useless for this flight.No boarding pass, no gate update and no miles snd more points.I had to call customer service to confirm if I really have reservation.So, Lufthansa, what was wrong with the previous version of the app( which was working perfectly) ??? | This app is bad every time I try to use it it wants a new password!!!! And it never updates my flights!!!!! | Nice app, but would like to see a standby list for the flight with boarding priorities. 

Also it is quite odd not to show the departure time for the flight, just the boarding time. | Easy to use. Quick.

Now that I have my ticket , which train do I have to catch to get to the airport on time ? | It is impossible to plan a trip between any 2 destinations. No matter what you select it says no trips available | Removed the departures tab and greatly reduced the options in the latest update. I‚Äôm really not sure why this was done? | The NS app of the Dutch railways has a serious security issue: after one logs in with username and password it offers no option to log out. As a result any outsider who gets their hands on the phone and can open the app and find personal information like one‚Äôs pre purchased tickets with dates of travel on the app. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed soonest. Now, while it is true that one can login from the app to one‚Äôs  NS website account and log out again, that does not take away from the fact that once one is logged into the NS app without being logged in to NE website, the security issue I described above still exists. By contrast well designed railway apps like that of the SSB of Switzerland do have an option to log out the app so no one without a username and password can log in. 

This issue is especially serious for international travelers who, if the travel infrequently to the Netherlands, unlike Dutch public transport travelers will be unlikely to have their public transport card  and means of pay (the OV chip card) which makes it easy to buy tickets and do without the NS app. | Works like a charm. Updated my platform instantly. Highly recommend even if you do not take NS very often. | Unable to use eticket in offline mode? | Very easy to plan and buy tickets. | Bij uitvallen van treinen is het onmogelijk gebruik te maken van de NS app. De app update niet je reisplan en geeft dus verkeerde informatie. Dit is hetzelfde geval met het veranderen van aankomst en vertrek sporen, dit gebeurt in zijn geheel niet in de app. Op dit vlak is de website een stuk beter, maar helaas minder snel. | Installing the app should not be required when you already bought a ticket online. | Please add Apple Pay ! For ticket purchases you are directed to an outside payment processor and have type in your information everytime. You can‚Äôt even save your cc info.  Very cumbersome. | This app is set up very well for international travelers. It‚Äôs very easy to navigate the app in English and purchase tickets. I was at ease using this app. | Add Apple Pay please. Would make it even easier | Why do I have to download an app? Why not just give you a pdf with the qr code or allow to save ticket in apple wallet? 
So confusing, downloading the app took forever, I had to click several times and wait for ticket to open, the later when I wanted to use it was no longer there so had to do the same.
Finally there seems to be no gate on the ticket, and the information there is in Dutch (which I cannot read), so don‚Äôt know where to go. Awful app and service. | This app is convenient. When you want to pay it redirects you immediately to the bank app (after you choose to pay with the app). | This saved me from the hard to use kiosk at Amsterdam Muiderpoort. | I use the day a few times a week and generally it's the best way to plan public transport. I would live to see a possibility to adjust the amount I'm willing to walk to reach the train station. My office is just in-between two train stations, and one is a 14-minute walk, the other a 16-minute walk. The app only ever shows me trains from/to the first station. Alternatively allow choosing two train stations as possible start/end point. Thank you! | Login fails repeatedly. Not only for myself, but my son who also attempted to use the app. We thought creating a personal account on the website might help, but the website constantly failed with ‚Äúcannot verify the address‚Äù messaging. The app may just be a front end for the NS website. Either way, don‚Äôt bother wasting your time.

Update: the developer responded with an irrelevant answer, which I won‚Äôt bother refuting. The basic problem still exists; trying to login after creating an account ends with an error stating ‚Äútry again later‚Äù. This error is posted many times throughout the reviews and not once is it answered (I waded through seeking an answer before submitting a negative review). Sorry, app is useless. | Plase fix this issue | Eg (some, if not all) notifications are in Dutch. | Same problem as prior person. Can‚Äôt log on. Get an error to try later. Been trying for a week and same error. Logged in on website but it doesn‚Äôt provide for United States users. So essentially, the website and app are useless | Makkelijker dan ik dacht, vooral na wat gedoe op de website met verwijzingen, gekochte kaartje nog niet gebruikt, hoop dat het werkt! | Hi, I don‚Äôt want to give the app a bad review because everything is just working and its good:) but sadly every time i try to login it says it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work and that i need to try later‚Äù but i‚Äôm trying now for like 4 days and i know for 100% sure my password is correct and its quit annoying I hope you guys know what to do because I have exams in 2 weeksüòï but guys have a great dayüíï | I bought a train ticket on the app and when I tried to scan it in the train station, it wouldn‚Äôt work. When I contacted customer support they told me they could not refund the ticket even though I had never used it. A waste of my money and time. | Every time I click on ‚Äúreserve a bike spot‚Äù when booking a train ticket, a browser pops up and says hyperlink not valid. Even if I try to log in to my account, it still doesn‚Äôt work. I can only do it on NS.nl and on my computer. On the smartphone version of NS.nl, while booking a place for bike, Google Captcha will show up on top of the page and it‚Äôs not impossible to scroll up to verify the Captcha. So many bugs. Please fix. | Why is the process of buying tickets and retrieving them so convoluted | I think there must be a simple with to connect personal ov chip card with the app do that you can simple check in and out with you phone.  It sounds simple but would be one of the best feature. | App Store says its available in English and Dutch. But there‚Äôs nothing in English, which is bizarrely provincial given how many expats are living in NL and using NS services. If you have time and patience, get this, else wait until (if ever) a language besides Dutch is supported. | Arrived in Netherlands. Data roaming on phone is working well. But all this app does is state ‚Äúsomething went wrong when requesting trips‚Äù. No functionality available at all. Useless. | Apple Pay not supported. Additionally the app indicated amex is accepted, however it is not. The payment screen does not display in English! | Great app that looks and works perfectly. It only misses Apple Watch support, just like the NS International app. | By far this is the best app I have ever tried for using public transportation in any country. | This app is brilliant and extremely accurate! Not only kept me on time but also able to time a different train of needed. I wouldn't live with out it! If you travel get it! | Tried to use an e-ticket, but the check in scanner doesn‚Äôt work with the QR code because there is also an NFC reader built into it, causing the Apple Pay screen to appear. | This app is easy to use and much more comprehensive than the transit support in maps (or google maps). All the information you need is right at your fingertips. The only minor issue is that the disruption information is only in Dutch (I just copy/paste into google translate). | Well, I selected English in settings, but the disruptions only shows Dutch, so this was not helpful for me. I'm hoping for an update to correct this. | This is a must have app for traveling in The Netherlands.  It provides all you need to plan for train travel in that country to include ticket purchasing.  Great for business travel in NL! | On iPad the multiple stacking panels are a waste of screen real estate and the narrow strips make it difficult and confusing to find information.

It would be great to have:

- train names listed, so travelers can be certain the train they are taking is correct. Sometimes trains come a minute early or late and this would help us know which one to take rather than just assuming the time and track is accurate. 
- English for disruptions.
- submission for lost items or reporting incidents

Thanks!! | Completely useless.

You level up. I would change a few things. 

But my biggest issue, there is no more levels to play. I‚Äôve looked through other reviews. Why keep updating the game, if you don‚Äôt add more levels? 

I honestly would give this a five star rating if you added more levels, but this is absolutely ridiculous.

I was just going to go ahead minding my own business and leave you to yours but you had to step inside my bubble so here goes.  The game play is pretty basic and simple.  Customers come in and their orders are displayed over their head (think pictogram).  You are behind the counter, cooking up the order and swiping the food out to them when it‚Äôs ready.  You need to serve a set number of customers and earn a predetermined amount.  Easy peasy.  What isn‚Äôt quite as easy is putting up with ALL the ads you are subjected to.  At the end of each round, roughly 20-30 seconds of gameplay, you are forced to watch an ad for another game.  Now it doesn‚Äôt matter how many times you click ‚Äòdone‚Äô, indicating that you are NOT going to get that game, the ad plays on.  Okay so good little captive audience here (SO NOT!) I let the ad play on and then when it LOOKS LIKE they are going to return control of your tablet to you up pops the dregs of the ad you thought you had finished watching.  This time, in the corner of the screen, there is a countdown clock where they spend the next 20/30 seconds giving you a chance to realize you really did want to get that game.

So finally all tricks and ads are behind you.  You played a round of their game and then they forced you to watch an ad for additional ‚Äòfree‚Äô games you can get so it‚Äôs your turn to get to play another round of the game.  Not so fast Bucky boy!!  There‚Äôs ANOTHER, full length, ad you have to suffer through. Oh did I say suffer, y‚Äôall know I meant to say sit through.  Anyway, it‚Äôs the same ‚Äòtricks are for kids‚Äô nonsense that you just went through.  Are you FREAKING kidding me?? You have to watch four times as many ads compared to the actual time you get to spend playing this game!!  Ahhh, but SPENDING is a very key word for this situation.

You see, the developer(s) figured out that there aren‚Äôt too many people in the world willing to CONSTANTLY waste their time sitting through multiple ads for things they don‚Äôt want.  They have the solution and it‚Äôs surprisingly inexpensively priced.  For just simple ad removal a mere $2.99 will make this game so much more fun, theoretically speaking cuz I have not ponied up for my glass of kool-aid.  If you are the type who thinks ahead, and you see yourself playing a lot of this game then you will probably want to go for package two.  For the low, low price of $6.99 you will still get the ads removed but you also get a healthy bundle of gems.  I think it may have been 500 gems but to be perfectly honest, I forgot while writing this review and realize I don‚Äôt care.  

So there you have it folks.  A relatively fun game, if you‚Äôre looking for something REALLY SIMPLE, but spoiled by the sheer number of ads you are forced to watch.  If you don‚Äôt mind being charged for removing the ads, which the developer not only CHOSE to put in between game rounds but DOUBLED DOWN on the decision to make paying for the ads seem almost like a blessing.  It‚Äôs like paying the playground bully to stop beating you up every day.  But hey, that‚Äôs just my personal opinion on the matter.  I thought of a different way to avoid all the ads, with the accompanying wasted downtime.  Yes, that‚Äôs right‚Ä¶simply remove the game from my tablet. Problem solved and I have done my civic duty by writing this review and letting folks know exactly to expect.  Have a blessed day and hopefully, you will enjoy whichever decision you make. | This game is super fun 2 play! I love designing restaurants and serving food. Just only one complaint‚Ä¶
I hate the ads. I see this one romance ad over and over, it‚Äôs really annoying. But besides that, it‚Äôs an awesome game! | This a very good game | Updated: 3/9/24
So I decided to pay for the ad removal (no biggie) but now, the game has just stopped. Only 10 cities?! Wow! I‚Äôve been waiting for 2wks to see if they‚Äôll add more levels, but nth. So after all of that, I‚Äôm forced to play the same levels over and over with the daily contest that are essentially pointless!

This game is really a joy to play. I like how you get a chance to double your winning after a level. I like the renovation feature and the story line. The only con, despite all the ads are when you play a city and complete that level, when you have to travel‚Äîthey take all but $2000 of your coin earnings. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I understand that the objective is for the developers to make money but that‚Äôs crazy! Games I like, I spend money on them anyway, especially to get rid of ads but, this feature I don‚Äôt like. | Thanks | You can have ads, but too much ads that I can‚Äôt turn it off | Love the game, I find it very fun to play. My only problem is that it lets players purchase upgrades after the level is complete that they don‚Äôt get to use. That‚Äôs a waste of the gems and I can‚Äôt complete the puzzle for that level because the only way to bring up that screen is by playing the levels. I would recommend that you initiate a separate screen to purchase the upgrades or add infinite level after the level is complete. Sometimes I struggle with the newer levels and would love to play the old levels for fun, especially after upgrading everything. Seems like a waste of gems and oof to anyone who actually purchases gems. | Awesome game üëçüèºüòÑ | Bravo! This is a fun well made game. I‚Äôve played so many cooking games and they are pretty much all the same. | I love it | Like many games of this sort we get ads all the time, we even get ads after watching an ad and it can pretty frustrating to the point that they push us to buy the ad removers but that doesn‚Äôt count for the fact that we have to watch advertisements in order to duplicate our earnings regardless the game is super fun, not so repetitive, hold a storyline along renovating and is pretty entertaining as well. | Developers listened to the complaints because the levels got easier after the latest update! I can actually beat levels without having to spend money. Great update, great game! | ÊúâË∂£ÔºåÂæàÂñúÊ¨¢Áé©Ôºå‰ΩúËÄÖÂÅöÁöÑÂ§™Â•Ω‰∫ÜÔºåÂº∫Âà∂ÂπøÂëä‰πüÂ∞ë | I purchase no ads and the ads are still popping up!  Very frustrating that I purchased something and they didn‚Äôt go away.  Wasted my money üò° | I might have only been playing this for a day, but I love it! The graphics are great and I love how the food and toppings look. You can also choose what wallpaper or flooring you want for your restaurant. Another thing is that you don‚Äôt have just one restaurant you get to do so many and there all different if you choose to believe it. I‚Äôve had about five or four restaurant games and this one is the best one I‚Äôve ever played.For once I‚Äôve found a game with the taste I have for a cooking game! | Why do we need to spend gems and coins for upgrades? I‚Äôve played several other cooking games and have NEVER had to do this. Watch ads to increase rewards which is NECESSARY to upgrade. Then watch a forced ad after. The first 2 ads I had to watch were the same. We all hate ads but know they are necessary, unless you play Township, Monopoly Go, Monopoly Solitaire or Chef & Friends (which is an awesome cooking game btw), but to watch the same ads over and over plus one right after the other is so much worse. The tutorial does not allow you to opt out of selecting what it tells you to which is another thing I don‚Äôt like. The story isn‚Äôt anything interesting. The gameplay isn‚Äôt anything special either. Even though I just started playing having to use gems for upgrades, the fact that it is necessary to opt to watch ads to upgrade or advance and the fact that nothing has kept me interested is the reason I will be deleting this game after this review. I will say that it is not hard to land on the 5x rewards when opting to watch ads even though it really doesn‚Äôt feel like much of an option. Developers really should make coins enough to purchase upgrades and save the gems for boosts when they run out like most other games of this sort. Having the option to watch ads for boosts instead of making them necessary to get anywhere would be a great improvement as well. | Cooking Live is awesome game. | There gave us awesome- there too many ads, why do i have to watch an ad after every game i play, SOOOOO ANNOYING! Either make the ads shorter or don't put so many. I'm about to delete even though i like the game. | Game was fun! I made it to level 10 but I had to delete it because there was an ad after every level. That is forcing it! | I love this game. | Cute simple cooking game like many others. You have to use your time wisely and cook the instructed combined meals. While upgrading and cooking faster. Easy peazy | First off I like the game and I would enjoy it but they make you watch an ad after every level complete and I don‚Äôt like that so I will be deleting the game because of it. | 1-8-24 Dropped a star they can‚Äôt be bothered to fix any of the issues and still no new levels. Seriously game is till jacked up now it doesn‚Äôt even register the leader board for the prestige points.  Also if u play on multiple devices it doesn‚Äôt carry your progress over even though I have the same profile id. The weekly tasks never reset they stay completed week after week!!    

Like the game but they have not added any new levels in a long time. They have levels for prestige points but those don‚Äôt add up or update correctly and these are just repeats of old restaurants which is so boring! then they still haven‚Äôt fixed the issue since the last updates where it gives u a chance to multiply your rewards but it doesn‚Äôt work correctly, this is a common occurrence for this company as u have the same issue w many of their games. They need to stop making new games and fix the multiple issues w their current games. Too bad as they are good games not that they seem to care cust service just blows u off!!!! | I love this game but it‚Äôs way too glitchy. I hope there are updates coming | First of all I just wanted to say that I LOVE this game! It is so amazing and it has several of different restaurants, you can build and design your restaurant and cook the food to get stuff to design. If you like designing and cooking this is the PERFECT game for you!! I would decently recommend this game. Reading some other reviews they say there are some hard levels which is true but you can get through them and it is actually fun to have a hard level here and there to give you a little challenge. Please don‚Äôt give up on such an amazing game if you don‚Äôt like hard and challenge then this isn‚Äôt the game for you. Do give bad reviews because the levels are hard, that‚Äôs just you being lazy and if they fix it and make it easy for YOU that makes it boring and easy for other people. So when playing this game or any game be considerate of other people. It is helpful, be a kind person it will benefit you. Anyway if you are up for designing, cooking, and a little challenge I would recommend this game. I will say it again, and again I LOVE THIS GAME!! | Understandable that there are ads. But this many and for so long. That is ridiculous. Every other game that also is free and has ads, at least you only need to watch for like 5 seconds then X OUT, but not this game. You have to watch 30 secs or longer which is longer than game play. Im deleting. As they say‚Ä¶ downloader beware. If you live to watch ads this game is for you. GL!     I‚Äôm out! | I find this game really fun and evenly paced. There are adequate rewards after each level too. | I love the skits and the adventure that this game takes you on.  It keeps you from getting boring by doing the same mundane things of JUST completing levels.  I don‚Äôt skip the skits LOL! | I really like this game but there‚Äôs way too many ads. | I was expecting a different type of game This is the same old cookinggame | I think this game is good so far. I just started it today. It‚Äôs different from the other ones I‚Äôm playing. I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out, lol. | I like the game. Maybe the developers have moved on to something else because there are few levels compared to other similar games. | I only found this game after watching an episode of Game Grumps and I am obsessed with playing this game! As an character artist I can appreciate the character designs and the graphics are super cute! Unfortunately, I‚Äôve run out of episodes so I‚Äôll patiently wait for an update. üòä | Trying to play this; but it stalls over and over and over. | This game starts out good: levels that are playable for even slow pokes like me. Ads are few in the beginning levels, but really ramp up. It‚Äôs to the point that they are between every short level, AND they are super annoying, in that they have to be clicked on like 4 times to make them go away. It‚Äôs a shame because this game is better than the usual restaurant games in that the levels are not impossible to reach given time and practice. And I don‚Äôt spend any money on games. I wouldn‚Äôt mind ads between levels but these annoying almost impossible to close ads are going to make me delete this game sooner than later. | Really good game, I found out about it from my friend and it seems really fun, just please remove some ads! The game is so good, but the ads... But overall it I really good! Keep up the good work! ‚ú®üéâüëå | This is a fun game but what is available to the player during some plays are unfair.   Everyone should have a chance to beat the stage and the boosters should only be there to make the level easier, not required to complete the level at all.  

The game forces the player to rely on boosters to even complete the level no matter how fast or well you do.  You need to sever 50 costumers and you are only presented with 43.    It almost seems it is about luck to complete a level than skill.   

The ads also break the game usually. | I absolutely cannot get past level 30. It‚Äôs very long and hard to even receive helpful booster to help me pass that level. All of the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù boosters can only be received in parts of 16. I had high hopes for this game as I have many others so I feel I have the skills needed to play these time management games. I will give it until the end of the month and if I still cannot pass this dreaded level (level 30) I am saying bye to this dreadful game.

UPDATE 6-19

Your response from this date was you did not understand my issue.  Now I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs being asked?  I will try again:

I am having major trouble passing level 30.  I have been on that same level for 3 weeks already and I am going to be deleting.  This game is obviously wanting the player to spend money to advance in the game.  Without it, you will left with frustration.  Thank you to whom responded but no thank you anymore.  üòû | I'm at level 70 and there is no way to get past it because even utilizing the boosters I cannot get passed this level.  Very frustrating because other games have ways of earning additional boosters but this game does not and of course the boosters required al always the one you don't have.  IMPROVEMENT NEEDED!!!! | Once you hit the ‚ÄúSirene Movie Theater‚Äù section, for some reason‚Ä¶ A LOT of the design options are taken away from you, most of the design choices for that theater were prechosen instead of letting me pick, which was really disappointing.

Also I‚Äôm starting to hit a point where with everything upgraded, I‚Äôm still struggling to beat levels without the ‚ÄúDouble Coins‚Äù booster which seems to have a lower percentage of obtaining in events and watching ads for the booster pieces than the other two boosters.

I find myself voluntarily watching a lot of ads to prevent myself from spending money. If that‚Äôs okay with you, the game is actually very fun for the most part and I DO recommend it if you have patience.

It would also be nice to be able to replay levels, especially if the challenges are gonna depend on that. I‚Äôve been staring at the ‚ÄúServe Coffee‚Äù challenge for a LONG time but I‚Äôm way past that level. | This games deserve a 2 star. At first when I saw the game I‚Äôm like ok cooking and house renovations ok I like it but then the levels came and it got stupid because why in the world is little things like table decor 3 or 4 stars and then they be hard levels for no reason is it that difficult for the smallest of things then I feel like it purposely does this things where you 4 or 5 coins down and you have I don‚Äôt know 5 seconds left and you get that one dish out and it says you didn‚Äôt complete it because you only got 3 of the 5 coin you have left to get so basically what I‚Äôm saying the game algorithm is lowkey

me",4.7484,3593,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e1/0f/77/e10f77ae-fc1c-2074-a22f-7723ae7b3547/fc92f384-40fd-4509-a06d-976ab91fd8e8_1_develop_your_story_2208x1242.png/406x228bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e6/db/ec/e6dbec4d-40f6-5c0c-e121-0bef23cd4148/6773b897-9e11-4181-ab78-53a43f34bacf_2_renovate_restaurants_2208x1242.png/406x228bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/59/2b/65/592b654a-8ed5-cf91-62f6-16b9f6f9e2c6/919e9587-7c19-478f-95fa-c02a68ecb49b_3_serve_customers_2208x1242.png/406x228bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/78/4d/de/784dde2a-d229-ac7d-a476-313c4c9a039e/b5e405c4-a4f5-4574-8899-daf8fdfcc2c6_4_choose_best_decor_2208x1242.png/406x228bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6c/96/fc/6c96fcd6-61bf-fa9a-c774-b3cd703fb247/e3dd7d85-8e3b-4610-aaa6-ca4a98a2500a_5_unlock_new_locations_2208x1242.png/406x228bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/56/4a/91/564a91b9-cb1c-aac3-56ba-2e91f8735597/772fb01c-d950-40bc-9377-9d2a69eea2de_7_travel_around_the_world_2208x1242.png/406x228bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/42/e6/42/42e642fc-c35a-3631-8acd-897ea4cafc44/57ac03fc-eced-40db-8189-07539cbaf55f_8_gameplay.png/406x228bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/72/b6/c4/72b6c40a-80a9-5505-6f35-af894260171a/c56bd63e-7460-419b-868e-57d03019f00a_8_9_gameplay_2208x1242_2.png/406x228bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/39/19/72/3919728c-d2f0-d158-4c46-451feb47145b/0fa68e4a-9d1b-4e9f-ab4c-3f66644de036_8_9_gameplay_2208x1242.png/406x228bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/db/f9/35/dbf93544-8e2c-3841-727e-27ce1a9ce40e/3e11f341-f024-4263-84d3-f0a68bc626e9_1_develop_your_story_2732x2048.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/94/1e/8e/941e8ee3-edb2-5c99-5900-73e2446a02a7/8ad81d1e-a151-425e-9762-32bba66a1a28_2_renovate_restaurants_2732x2048.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/91/cc/e5/91cce592-428d-c047-2589-da00032c2b5b/822ce4c1-93aa-4c86-b762-89c5f3791d58_3_serve_customers_2732x2048.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/84/52/4e/84524e95-ec84-bf7c-a708-6b4c81658626/b109c73b-bf22-447f-a083-577bac66d576_4_choose_best_decor_2732x2048.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/dc/3b/70/dc3b7005-0c3c-00ac-0dae-e65b0fc2a4e4/a3c88963-7345-48b3-91ee-b8b370e43277_5_open_new_location_2732x2048.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/54/66/9f/54669f8b-bc16-dda0-731e-f617f82b4234/04ef8d7d-ac08-49f7-aa8a-4e50bdd91090_7_travel_around_the_world_2732x2048.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/da/c2/2f/dac22f4e-8fc7-80b1-a4d8-1d75f3850a19/c32c2d1d-3c64-437d-bb18-ed5275db54f1_8_gameplay_2732x2048.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/66/11/4d/66114dcf-caf2-a759-1961-6b3d000c1e03/331e560f-e3dd-4d9b-866f-7bb6fcb3ef77_8_9_gameplay_2732x2048.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/8f/36/87/8f368721-afc8-46f6-71fc-b38ae355b239/98696dcd-e971-4aaf-9170-dbdaf39fe43f_8_9_gameplay_2732x2048_2.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProS

Very poor service. John | I had a problem with the microphone. It‚Äôs working now. I wanted to communicate with a person. I found it frustrating to only be directed to their FAQ type files and an bot that I couldn‚Äôt communicate with. It was over the weekend. However, finally they contacted me by email and have been working very hard to help me. I will review how I like using the program later as I haven‚Äôt been able to use it. | Useless. Tried every fix online to get audio. iOS 17, iPhone 14 so not my phone. Just the app. No way to contact them. | This app is terrible. It doesn‚Äôt start off with simple vocabulary like the days of the week or even numbers or months of the year. It starts speaking in sentences and picks words to get you to memorize. The structure is all wrong for a beginner. If I could get my money back I would. | Once one gets past the beginning stages of a new language, this application is not that useful. BTW, I‚Äôm mostly using the Spanish language module. Coverage of verbs is spotty, and the structure of the application is such that it makes it difficult to go back and review previously learned material. For example, the available review options have almost no connection to the lesson plan, so don‚Äôt really constitute a review at all. It‚Äôs the same entry level material over and over again. There must be better options available out there‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt be renewing the Babbel subscription again | So much focus on pronouns, no focus on real words / necessary things to say. Also, impossible to figure out how to cancel | Way better then Duolingo | A few weeks ago, I downloaded Babbel. The lessons are great. I took the German course in hopes of learning German because I find it a very cool language. The login and setup was perfect and I started to like it because I was excited to learn to fluently speak German. I did ONE lesson. I finished it very quickly and then when I was done, all the other lessons were locked. I clicked on the lesson 2 and it said, ‚ÄúYou need to buy a subscription to continue.‚Äù And it wouldn‚Äôt let me click out of the thing. So I just pressed my phones home button, took it out of my recent tabs, and didn‚Äôt play it for a week. I think I‚Äôd like it better if at least a bit more lessons were free. It allows one lesson, and a review and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt really think I can commit to subscribing to an app I just got. I don‚Äôt want to come off as harsh. I would love this app if the subscription was needed later on or optional. I‚Äôve deleted the app now since my parents didn‚Äôt want to buy me lessons. I don‚Äôt mind it since I wasn‚Äôt very invested in the app. I recommend this if you can pay for lessons. I love the way it teaches you and if you can pay, its wonderful. But thank you for reading this and this is just my honest opinion and no hate here was intended. | I started using babble just a few months ago to try and learn Spanish as a new skill. It‚Äôs very fun and rewarding babble has many tools to help you learn quickly with listening, talking, reading, and writing. I am excited to keep going | Couldn‚Äôt get past the dumb beginner levels. ‚ÄúPlacement alghorithms‚Äù STINK.

And after trying it for 2 weeks, I am more and more despondent that my cell phone is crowded with beginner levels and won‚Äôt let me mark them complete, or get rid of them or go on to more advanced things!!!!!! 

Dumb dumb dumb dumb. | Many good things about the teaching style but it gets the English translations wrong, wrong, wrong. And it‚Äôs wrong on purpose because it tries to convey the essence of the sentences rather than a real translation. And this makes it very difficult to do the flashcards because it asks for the translation of a very different English sentence. Conveying the essence of a sentence is valid but Babble takes some BIG liberties. | I was going to compare this app with duolingo, while learning japanese, but they didnt have it, like cmon you have two spanish languages, but no japanese? | It‚Äôs been a horrible experience.  Charged multiple times for numerous subscriptions. No cancel option in the App Store. Don‚Äôt purchase this app. | You have to pay for Babbel when you can just use Duolingo for free. I used a bunch of other Spanish learning apps but I only got like one lesson in sometimes not even one but after I finish I have to pay üí∞ 

Duolingo is the only free language app I can find they even have other uses too like music and math I haven‚Äôt tried them myself but I‚Äôm learning Spanish easily with Duo ü¶ú

(This Isn‚Äôt An Ad Just My Opinion) | This is by far my favorite language learning app‚ÄîI have even bought a lifetime subscription! The ONE feature I would like to see brought back is at the review notification icon. Previously, the icon used to show how many terms were set for review. This was nice when I had a lot going on at school and I could make a plan for how many terms to review daily until I was ‚Äúcaught up.‚Äù Now, the icon only shows ‚Äú99+‚Äù I would love at least the option to bring back how many terms are up for review. 

Also, I have completed all of the A levels, yet after awhile, I will all of a sudden see that there are lessons or courses that are no longer marked complete, I would love to see this updated or understand if there is a reason they are becoming marked incomplete. | This app keeps charging my bank account for an unauthorized amount of $359. I disputed the first charge with my bank. Second charge I‚Äôm not able to dispute. There is absolutely nowhere on the app or website that I can request a refund or even find out what this charge is for! There is no customer service number and I can‚Äôt find a way to reach out to someone!!!!!! | Please fix it, especially for German. I live in Germany. I know that I am pronouncing words like ‚Äúelf‚Äù correctly. Yet, I have to repeat myself seven times to be ‚Äúheard‚Äù correctly. It‚Äôs always been this way. That‚Äôs why I left Babbel the first time. Looks like I might dump it again. It‚Äôs very frustrating. | I‚Äôve used other learning apps but I like this one better. It‚Äôs not a timed event video game. It makes sense the way that I learn. | Most of the program works but it keeps telling me to review the lesson and the review feature doesn‚Äôt work. I feel ripped off. | I‚Äôm writing 4/5 stars because i haven‚Äôt actually used the app due to my schedule, but i have gone through more language learning apps such as duolingo but it isn‚Äôt good enough to help me learn fluent french so i‚Äôm hoping Babbel will offer better and more fluent education. üòäüòÅüëç | They only give you oneLesson and it‚Äôs not even good They make you pay for the rest and it‚Äôs downright awful. It‚Äôs so glitchy and I‚Äôm sorry for saying this, but it is so y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm so sorry but don‚Äôt download this. | Bagus dan gampang dipelajari | There should be tracking of things wrong then review it should not keep going forward when it‚Äôs obvious you haven‚Äôt learned | La aplicaci√≥n tiene un m√©todo que articula
La gram√°tica con las habilidades comunicativas. Me gusta que no gamifica sino que se centra en la adquisici√≥n de vocabulario y conceptos que de verdad se requieren. Lastimosamente el identificador de voz es in√∫til. Mi esposa y yo adquirimos los planes y ambos nos sucede que as√≠ pronunciemos mal o hasta en espa√±ol, la aplicaci√≥n toma la respuesta como correcta. Esto es muy decepcionante si quieres mejorar la pronunciaci√≥n. Es una l√°stima porque los contenidos y textos son muy adecuados. | I love this app. Not only can I learn at my own pace (and review as often as is necessary) there is a variety of practices to help me general and apply my skills. | Teaching to much at one time.  It‚Äôs hard to retain.  Not enough repetition | Please don‚Äôt pay for this. The microphone doesn‚Äôt work and doesn‚Äôt pick up your speech when it asks you to dictate back. I wish there was a refund option‚Ä¶ | Accessible and very workable | I hadn‚Äôt logged on for awhile and am disappointed at the amount of typing/ unscrambling scrambled words that is required now. It‚Äôs cumbersome to do on a phone and a very slow way for me to learn. I just need to get used to hearing Spanish conversations. I also preferred that before I could bypass the rote repetition of words with the microphone. (My pronunciation is okay‚Ä¶ but I need to hear/ interact with more conversations. | I was taking free Spanish lessons with Duolingo for a complete year. I heard Babbel was better, and I purchased a year subscription, I had really enjoyed learning at Duolingo. I do not find Babbel fun at all. Whatever I learned at Duolingo the language appears to be so so much different on Babbel and the teaching technique is not fun at Babbel. And I can‚Äôt get a hold of anyone to help. 3/24/24- it‚Äôs been over 2.5 months now since I‚Äôve been using Babbel. Like I said in last review, I am NOT a fan of Babble. The learning on Duolingo was so much more fun, I enjoyed coming back daily, now, not so much. Also, I try to get on daily, if only to review, I don‚Äôt like the teaching technique through babble so I prefer to review more often, I didn‚Äôt realize it, but babble doesn‚Äôt give me credit for only reviewing! Which means it doesn‚Äôt count a review day towards positive action in learning! If I could woo back to Duolingo, and get credit from babble I would in a heartbeat, let me politely say, I dislike babble, a lot!! I want to learn Spanish, but I want to enjoy the learning process, sad meüòî I do want to add I like that Babble provides Spanish listening skills and games, that is a real plus, perhaps learn from Duolingo, then when you know a lot of the words, go to babble, too bad there isn‚Äôt some kind of way they could combine techniques!  I think ü§î | This app you have to pay to be able to do more levels. But why would you have to pay when a bunch more apps are free. It‚Äôs confusing when other apps can and will teach you more in only 1 lesson. Honestly its not worth it and I regret signing up. I believe you should NOT get this app if you dont want to pay. | Goes too fast. Not sure I am learning. | It is good but the reason I don‚Äôt give it 5 stars is the streak system is bugged. It randomly resets and gets rid of your streak. | I CAN ONLY DO ONE LESSON UNLESS I PAY A SUBSCRIPTION!! | I‚Äôm doing intermediate courses. I watch a lot of French tv shows and now I understand about half of what‚Äôs being said without subtitles. Considering how fast the actors speak I think that‚Äôs pretty good.  I also actually understand the imperfect tense which I didn‚Äôt after minoring in French in college. The app makes it pretty painless and the reviews ensure you retain what you learn. | Babbel starts out okay, but then the lessons become incredibly difficult. Makes learning very hard. The way the lessons are taught is almost pointless. Other apps have much more repetition. Other apps have much more relevant words and content. | Is it true that duolingo takes ur family or is it just a meme | Although I find this mode of learning interesting, I am seeking a textbook to supplement the audio lessons. I seem to need the support of a textbook for reassurance. I have always learned with textbook and audio and audio feedback, i.e. the classroom and need that reassurance to supplement the plain audio learning. I learned some elementary Spanish in summer school when I was 7 and 8 in Southern California. I now live in an area of people of Cuban descent. These 2 Spanish languages are quite different to my ear. | Babel is amazing for learning a new language because it goes slow when pronouncing a word. It also helps you fix your mistakes so you master every word, finally it works on everything like spelling, speaking, writing and more. | I really expected more from this app.  It is so basic and doesn‚Äôt have any complex logic whereby you would get help on things you are struggling with.  It goes from basic vocabulary to all of a sudden complex verb conjugation with sentence structure that was never reviewed previously.  I‚Äôm getting disheartened with continuous low scores averaging 63% now and no redirection to other help sources.   Disappointing. | Overall the app is a great way to learn language but the fact that I download the courses so I can study offline and I can‚Äôt launch it in offline mode annoys me a lot. Went through the issue with customer support but nothing change. I am a little dissapointed | I‚Äôve been paying the subscription fees for close to a year now; however, because I didn‚Äôt use the service for 8 months it locked all of my lessons and wants me to re-subscribe and pay even more money. If you‚Äôre not going to use Babbel cancel your subscription and dispute any charges right away! I can‚Äôt even get a hold of customer service to show I‚Äôve been paying for my subscription this entire time, so I should have full use of the services‚Ä¶ even though I took a long break from using the app. Don‚Äôt go through Babbel their lessons are wonderful but their customer service and billing is horrible. | Overall a pretty good app, but the speaking lessons are a pain on this iPad. Sometimes I speak and nothing happens at all‚Ä¶ sometimes I get it wrong, but repeat it the exact same way and get it right; sometimes I deliberately mispronounce something and get it right anyway. There is no real feedback on why the pronunciation was wrong, so I just sit there repeating it over and over until I can move on.

The Portuguese pronunciation lessons are odd and don‚Äôt benefit from having examples with people speaking different accents. Sometimes the text explanations don‚Äôt match what I hear at all, √âu does not sound anything like o, etc. | Great job | Time is money and this app waste so much time teaching Spanish that is not relevant. If you choose Latin American Spanish, be prepared to waste days learning European Spanish | Would give a zero if I could. So sick of the agenda being crammed down my throat everywhere. Ridiculous. | Seems like the app is not working correctly. Some of the lessons are not accessible or broken. I‚Äôm not allowed to choose the language I want to learn which is Portuguese. I‚Äôm regretting paying for the subscription. | I thought it was going to be free i could only do one lesson! How am i supposed to know spainish? | I am just getting started, but I can already see how Babble will help me learn Spanish.  Never any pressure, and it makes learning fun. | I think I will enjoy it more when I get an iPad. Currently I‚Äôm using my phone which is a limitation for me.

I  like it very much however there are places where I am  left hanging and don‚Äôt know where to go. I‚Äôve had that experience three times and I quit the lesson. This time I took a picture of it.",4.72241,583745,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c5/b2/24/c5b22493-227f-09bd-59d2-797abda5167e/faea642e-c65f-4abb-a9a3-f8fa0c29e8af_AppStore_1242x2208_ENG_US_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a6/b2/0f/a6b20f67-344d-a755-14bd-6c7c29c923ac/63e554d0-4b47-4fab-be3d-a57280fe21d1_02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/13/0c/8f/130c8f8b-1e4f-fcae-a2a1-60c904e3128c/6538a687-e7bb-4c1e-8e6f-5ef54e0cb402_03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0b/ca/40/0bca40a5-fe17-5257-9376-9d198f6756fe/15fe13e8-425a-4e01-9462-b35bf88ff168_04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/25/fd/3f/25fd3f8e-bce1-63c9-26af-33255f0f60bc/900477bc-a5c2-4147-abd6-b3a66c457ca5_05.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b1/96/da/b196daac-f7da-6c77-1026-4f5fc0c25ec0/c52c443f-de6c-4361-8c01-ec16e6eee9fb_06.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0f/af/4f/0faf4f4e-a45b-ff00-6679-027eceb40adf/91a78ce3-e500-4014-95c5-5c0d33a5b7e6_07.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/4f/9c/a7/4f9ca7b4-bcde-304d-78d3-c93d55fc1532/e8f6b604-915d-48f7-9063-5df865220be9_08.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/bb/5c/70/bb5c70d2-d998-89e4-02a7-dcb8f8c8dff6/f924c1bc-03d7-40b4-a266-bb93854d7462_AppStore_2048x2732_ENG_US_01.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/87/db/ac/87dbac6a-1026-3510-cf8e-7a91f2767b73/d6b301e0-cb1a-4ae7-85cf-185dbe6e7cda_02.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/21/b3/c4/21b3c4c5-d9c0-70be-c9dc-f68773c3b3d2/a932651c-cde4-4d85-9aeb-fe65daf0e1f1_03.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/25/19/f5/2519f511-83d9-c705-b820-8fde0999a065/d892c114-1064-46ba-8152-93df55eab364_04.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e7/dc/17/e7dc17d6-c21b-893f-78c7-b140562037fc/ffc10c49-21c1-489d-b22f-d83a19e946fe_05.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1c/12/86/1c1286c4-f171-3868-0589-d2158b453585/067e60e9-2969-4eb2-b6e5-186f9b61af2b_06.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f6/02/7f/f6027fd6-6a4b-266b-d1e6-24ffedad6566/69a6c1d1-b50e-426c-8bd9-931d9e4d9348_07.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen""

Never had any issues until this week, when I apparently hit the maximum number of expenses on the free plan per day - FOUR. No communication about this change except a paywall. Reaching out to support they said ‚Äúoh letting you know in the app is the best way to inform you‚Äù. No, telling loyal customers in a static written format is the best way. Four expenses per day is absolutely absurd. This app is now useless to me unless I can afford to pay monthly or yearly for this app. You | The new transition is a betrayal to loyal customers since the inception. This is utterly ridiculous and disappointing experience!!
I hope they stop being a money hungry company. | Needs an option to created a group without adding people with their contact information.

There needs to be an option to create a group and just have option to add multiple people under same account. I don‚Äôt want to add everyone as friends, sometimes I just want to track things on my end. | This app makes splitting bills at my daughter‚Äôs 8-person house at college a breeze. | Suddenly paying bills got easy. | This app is useless now with the new update. I‚Äôd rather spend extra time making a Google sheet than to support cash-grabbing decisions like this one. | I‚Äôm frustrated about the new limitations of free user.  I can understanding the want to increase revenue, but the current methodology makes the app legitimately unusable.  It seems to only allow 3 expenses per day or so.  That‚Äôs ridiculous. | This was an incredible app but their new structure tries to coerce/torture you into paying for Pro. Now it‚Äôs hardly useable. Would not recommend the free version any longer.

Update ‚Äî Venmo released a ‚ÄúGroups‚Äù feature as a Splitwise alternative which is great! | Limiting the number of transactions I can add in a day if I'm not a subscriber? Man you really are desperate in this recession. Guess what: Splid and excel do the same thing so sayonara. | Can not add more than 6 expenses in a day. | We use Splitwise for our charter sailing vacations and it is th perfect tool to keep our expenses equal.  Highly recommend it. | As the rest of the reviews explain in detail, they took a great app and ruined it with subscription pricing.
A one-time fee could be reasonable, but a monthly subscription for an app that most don‚Äôt use every month is terrible. | Expense limits really ruined this app, not worth it for casual users anymore. A bummer because this was the best group expense app I‚Äôve seen. | Used to make use of this app religiously whenever going on trips with friends, but now it barely lets you add a transaction or two before forcing you to wait and is limited to letting you add less than 5 a day. Terrible business practice to remove basic functionality and hide it behind a paywall that does not offer much besides an opportunity to restore the app to the way it used to be for free. It‚Äôs insulting to the point that I would rather not use the app even if it was technically better than every other alternative. | Instead of adding features to make upgrading to pro incentivizing, they have decided to remove features for free users. No thank you. | Splitwise ASSUMES a user‚Äôs Venmo account uses the same email that is bound to that user‚Äôs Splitwise account. How dare any app make such a tragic assumption like that in regard to finances. I had a botched group ski trip with 11 people, many of which were new users. When it came to pay via Venmo, it is not obvious if it correctly connected to that user‚Äôs Venmo account or not. It just warns you ‚Äúhey we have no idea because we are making a dumb assumption. Double check‚Äù. But this warning is is NOT the solution, it‚Äôs the red flag of a glaring issue. Half of our group ended up sending payments to incorrect Venmo accounts because of this. No we don‚Äôt want to use Splitwise pay. And it‚Äôs ridiculous to expect every group member of a group to have to verify the email of the other individuals they have to pay. It‚Äôs such a tedious and redundant thing to ask of users. Instead‚Ä¶ Splitwise should be forcing a user to enter their Venmo @accountHandle to their account before they can accept payments. | App has become unusable. Switched to Splid! | Limiting the number of expenses to like 3/day is insane with the amount of competition they have. Deleting app | Couldn‚Äôt directly add guest. I tried to add guest to my travel group without going to contacts but couldn‚Äôt. That did for me. | The new Splitwise update is so frustrating since  it is trying to act like venmo and makes you set up a bank account now | Awesome concept that is super helpful for group trips and splitting bills up. Absolutely wild and unfortunate business decision they made to start charging for more than 4 expenses per day. There‚Äôs plenty of free alternatives to use instead that you can use | I had never heard of Splitwise until a friend recommended that our group use it.  It was unclear to everyone how to use it, so some members used Splitwise Pay and some did not because they were unsure about connecting bank accounts to a platform they had never heard of.  Now some of the funds are sitting in the Splitwise Pay platform and people haven‚Äôt gotten paid, which has made a huge mess of the calculations.  I contacted to support but have not received a response.  There was never an instruction saying ‚ÄúEVERYONE IN YOUR GROUP NEEDS TO USE SPLITWISE PAY OR NO ONE CAN USE IT.‚Äù  To Splitwise support:  PLEASE REPLY TO MY SUPPORT REQUEST!‚Äù | App is great but useless without monthly fee. | Can‚Äôt do anything without a pop up ad, sad to see after so many great years. | Used to love splitwise

Opened it for the first time in a while for a recent trip and free years are now limited to 3 expenses per day and a 10 second wait for each of those even!

Will be deleting the app after these final expenses are tallied. | This used to be THE app to have for big group trips to manage all expenses. The new limit on expenses per day has made the app unusable. Current looking for alternatives. | Do not trust this app! They are gathering way too much personal data without any secure ways of protecting it. | This app is amazing and comes in handy | Used to be my go to app for traveling. I understand that the app needs to make money. I am ok with having to wait a few a seconds before adding a new expense. But the new daily cap for expenses is too much. Venmo now has a similar group feature to Splitwise that‚Äôs free. Will be saying goodbye after this trip. | There are too many free alternatives for them to be limiting us to 4 purchases a day. Makes the app unusable. Moving on to Venmo/tricount. | Don‚Äôt bother unless you need Pro for something (you don‚Äôt). There are plenty of tools online that do the same thing for free. | Why would you add a paywall to the very function of your app that makes it viable. I used this app for everything and now I have a limit. Lost a loyal user | Love the app. Willing to pay per group, but I only use the app a few times a year. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to have a monthly subscription. Total bummer about the daily transaction limits. Completely arbitrary and unfortunate mod to push for pro subs. | The features on this app are being adopted by Venmo. Meanwhile, this app (Splitwise) is adding new ads, new barriers for use, etc. just to be annoying to get you to upgrade. Splitwise was a cool idea but they (Splitwise) is making it more difficult to use‚Ä¶ no brainer that I‚Äôm just going to use Venmo which offers all the same features with no charge and no annoying ads. | This app used to be amazing, super helpful, and perfect. Now that they‚Äôre trying to monetize off of their users by adding a daily limit and ads and what not it ruins the whole app. I will no longer be using this app, and I found another app that does the same exact thing, but everything is free with no ads and no limits. | 3 transactions?? 10 minute wait?? id rather use a free excel/google sheet | I signed up for pro, despite paying for the feature they aren‚Äôt showing up even after logging in and out & redownloading the app. | I could not have imagined how an app with such little functionality to begin with could take away so much of it and stick it behind a paywall. If they think I will pay this much money to not do basic addition, they are out of their minds. I couldn‚Äôt delete this app fast enough. Only redownloaded to write this review when they asked for feedback. Don‚Äôt put the entire free app behind a paywall, come up with some extra features and then maybe we‚Äôll talk. | I‚Äôve used splitwise for YEARS for group trips and splitting expenses with roommates. They‚Äôve now limited the amount of expenses you can submit per day to only 4 per day, and they force you to you stare at their subscribe screen for 10 seconds before they even let you add an expense. Literally fire the Product Manager who suggested this. I understand that Splitwise is a company that‚Äôs been around for a while and now needs to monetize, but this is not the way. I‚Äôm now looking for a different  app to use to settle up my most recent trip since we all want to pay each other back asap (we have to pay our credit card bills) but it would take us over a week to input all of our expenses with Splitwise‚Äôs daily limits. I have 30 expenses to add that I couldn‚Äôt add on the trip because I didn‚Äôt have wifi. With the 4 expense per day limit, it would take me 8 days to add them all. Ridiculous. Splitwise, change this immediately. At least give us the decency of a limit of 10 or something. 4/day is a slap in the face to your long time users. | I was able to split an expense between only select and exclude others. Very helpful! | I was a loyal user of Splitwise throughout the years and I got at least 10 people hooked up on it.
I know the times are hard, but limiting daily transactions is a bad decision to make. I‚Äôm unable to understand why did this happen, and why did you make such a mistake knowing that the users won‚Äôt like it. As a fellow developer and product manager, I can‚Äôt understand why would you want to make your loyal user base suffer like this.

There are better alternatives out there I‚Äôm sure. Even if there‚Äôs not, someone will make it and steal all your users eventually. | My daughter swears by it, but it‚Äôs so confusing to me. The totals almost never look right ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really trying to give it a chance but the aggravation of trying to figure out always gives me a headache! It‚Äôs a good idea‚Ä¶ but definitely doesn‚Äôt simplify the process other than to ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù make your debtors aware that they owe you money. | I don‚Äôt like it, it isn‚Äôt user friendly | The app is a basic calculator. Are you kidding? Easiest app deletion ever. | Looking for other better app now. | Disappointed to see the downfall of another app to a monetization push. Used to be my go-to for splitting travel expenses amongst friends but the 3 expense/day limit and 10 second wait time makes this unusable. Tip for the developer: add features to the Pro version of an app rather than removing them from the free version- you‚Äôre gonna lose users. RIP Splitwise, thanks for the good memories. Time to fire up Google sheets‚Ä¶ | You guys have a fantastic app that makes everything very easy. But your recent limits on transaction and mandatory 10 second adds for pro are really scaring people away. At this rate, a competitor is going to snap up your user base because people are sick of them. Already, friends prefer to use venmoed new group feature for convenience. I like your app, and I just hope you don't get buried because of this. | Used to be the best app, now they got greedy and want you to pay for their pro app.   They limit to 4 expenses or less a day lately.  It takes several days to settle expenses after a trip with these limits.  Very disappointing.  I‚Äôm fine watching adds if I must. But limits that then you can‚Äôt use the app at all is outrageous!

Exchanging fee is ridiculous. And no help from the support. I lost 300 usd for exchanging. Customer service is not helping at all and was giving me the wrong information which caused me to lose more money. And I called back, they told me they can‚Äôt do anything with that. I learned my lesson. This is the worst experience in my life. I won‚Äôt be using this for sure. THERE ARE MUCH BETTER EXCHANGE WAYS. AVOID THIS GUYS! | Hi
Travelex would have to be the worst travel card I had every had.
I have just sent over 2 hours just to put money on to my card.
When I try to do on your website it kept saying that my post code was invalid what is going on .
I try that site for over 1 hours and still didn‚Äôt work 
I will never used you guys again | reloading card is usually an adventure - it is always painfully slow, but sometimes it times out, and to make matters worse I‚Äôve had it complete the transaction even though it timed and and gave me an error message - so be careful when reloading because getting a time-out error message may not mean the card didn‚Äôt get reloaded | The app was great for the whole 2 weeks it was working. Now it hasn‚Äôt worked for months. I will be canceling my card soon because of all the issues. | When is the App going to be fixed. I‚Äôve called the customer service number repeatedly and they offer to assist me with my balance and reloading but I don‚Äôt want to reload if your system still isn‚Äôt secure. | When will this app go back online - US student in Europe and unable to add money to account. | Tells me there is an update, but it can‚Äôt find the server. Now I can‚Äôt  do anything with the app. | App is back online, however the update won‚Äôt work so I am unable to reload my card and access the app. | Seems like every time I turn around there is a problem with this app. Can‚Äôt put money into a card because their system is down. You have to jump through hoops to try and put money on it seems like. And now the app in general is just down? With no explanation whatsoever than a one sentence blurb in the explanation of what the app is. I‚Äôm just glad it wasn‚Äôt down while on my last trip so that I could keep up with my funds while on vacation. I‚Äôm not happy now though that I can‚Äôt just use the app to check my account for what I had left. Plus there‚Äôs not even any explanation that they are working on the app in hopes to have it working again. I love the convenience of this card and the app, when it works! | Used my money card previously with no problem. Have tried repeatedly over last few days to load card and nothing but ‚ÄúOops‚Äù error message.  Internet site inaccessible too, with ‚ÄúPlanned Maintenance‚Äù screen stating currency purchasing is temporarily unavailable.  Perhaps the least reliable service I have ever dealt with for such an allegedly big name in currency services. | If you are downloading this app. I would like to say I‚Äôm sorry for your loss in time and money. I have had this card for about a year and have not been able to use it. There is a penalty fee for not using the card so I have lost most of the money that I put into the account. 
I have made multiple calls and had to be transferred to multiple people each time repeating the same information and security questions.

Only now was I informed that we have to transfer the money to the country currency for each country traveled every time. | The app locked me out.  Customer service was of no help.  5 days later I was able to register on the website, and can now use the app.  Very disappointed so far. | Uses very confusing terms, like purse, move money, etc.  While trying to figure out how to load more money onto card, inadvertently changed currency with no confirmation screen.  When we changed back to the original currency, we had lost $33.  Tried to call customer service and got a call center in the Philippines.  After having to do two security verifications, call was dropped twice. After two hours of explaining and going through security process six times, was told there was nothing they could do.  Beware and hope you don‚Äôt need customer support! | This card has been so wonderful and having the ability to reload it as we go had made our trip worry free. | Trying to register my card but it‚Äôs not working. Never using Travelex again. | no matter how good of service you have on your phone, this app takes ages to load ANYTHING | I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the Travelex card and app.

In addition to getting bank rate currency values the only fee I encountered was $9.95USD to set up the card. 

Whilst traveling I was able to store multiple currencies. Convert for no charge and add funds on the go. No scammy exchange places, no ripoffs, no atms fees for cash. 

This card has earned a valued place in my passport holder and will be my go to travel card here on out! | Garbage app -- does not work for reloading. Only good for viewing balances. Have contacted app team twice, no response. | Slow 
Lost connections several times
Used valuable travel time watching the spinny thing and then Oops, error | I got it before coming out to the UK, it has worked everywhere I have shopped and eaten at. Reloading it is easy also. Recommend it for its contactless use also for ease of use. | What country we can use for | Easy to use. Thank you!!! | It took ten times to reload the card. It never told me what was the error or cause for the rejections. I kept trying until it finally accepted my payment >( | If we have leftover money that is eligible to go on the Travelex Money Card, can we bring the physical money into one of any of the stores/airport locations to have it put back on the card? If so, is their a limit ex)100,000 of each 
Please explain in depth on how this could possibly work | This is my first time using a money card for travel! It has been a great option for us! Very easy to use and so convenient! | When I log on it shows no balance or activity on my card. That is frustrating when your in a foreign country and it is your primary source of money and spending. So we have to keep a close eye on how much we think we have spent and guess at when to reload. Reloading is also cumbersome because even after logging in you have to supply a lot of the information again like passport details and credit card even though you checked the save my info. Hopefully this is a short technical difficulty with the app because it is frustrating. | Very easy to upload money to this card.  Excellent for my son‚Äôs internship abroad. | I downloaded the app before leaving. In Italy altogether for 18 days, the balance has not recalculated since the 2nd or 3rd day. Had to call the number in back of card to get the balance, likely incurring a phone charge. Can find no discussion of this issue. What do the experts suggest I do? | Stopped working and had to reinstall within a few days. Massive pain. | Bugs, won‚Äôt save your information. When I get home I‚Äôm canceling this piece of #%#. | Slow. Had to delete and reinstall to work | Before leaving on my trip I set up the app with no issues. Upon arriving at my destination and needing to reload my card I had to redo everything in the app as if I was setting it up again for the first time. Face ID didn‚Äôt work, all my credit card details missing (both travelex card and my Amex) | This app is easy to use, convenient and secure. I was able to reload my card without any problems. Feel very secure in this app. | I don‚Äôt like the fact that every time I load the card I need to enter ALL of my info every single time. | On your phone! | It would be fantastic if Travelex cards or the app supported Apple Pay. Otherwise a good service and app. | So easy to use. 
No question about security of the currency. | I was on the phone with 4 different people somewhere offshore who wasted 34 minutes of my time asking me the same thing over and over and over again to finally tell me they couldn‚Äôt help me! If you want to test your patience you should get this card. Test your limits! | I love Travelex and how simple it is to use when traveling, however the app never loads for me ever (I have an iPhone X with all software updates). I have to log in through safari to get anything done and see my account. Travelex is good but the app is terrible. Fair warning. | I can‚Äôt believe an international money app could be this bad. I can‚Äôt even log in | New Face ID works.....sort of....after verifying all it does is spin to finish logging in and it never quits spinning so you‚Äôre never logged in to use the app. Prior to that, I attempted to reload funds....never able to do that either. | This APP is very unstable. Basically, it does not work!! | Frustrating app. I had to call for password support although my password fit their criteria. Took 1 hour to sort. 
The debit is handy instead of an Oyster card, and it‚Äôs ok for purchases, restaurants etc. but honestly cash is way easier. Especially as taxis add fees, ATMs sometimes do, even though the card is supposed to be no fees. There‚Äôs fees every time you turn around. 
I intend to keep it with a low balance only, and use it as an Oyster card ONLY. | The TravelEx app and its ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù do not a) load properly and b) work on iPhone.

The card is OK (not great) and the app is useless. | I recently traveled to the UK from the United States. I purchase this card at the US Bank in Cincinnati Ohio. A number of things went wrong.

The lady at the counter got my birthday wrong, it took three days for them to fix it. I then proceeded to upload the amount of $600 onto my travelex card and Travelex withdrew the money from my checking account, however, it never uploaded the money onto the travelex card. This was done through the app.

Customer service was extremely unhelpful.

However, the lady at US Bank in Cincinnati did put 100 pounds onto the travelex card because of the issues I was having. This was great. However, I still am out $600 until it gets returned back onto my debit card.

Finally after 7 Days, the money was finally returned back into my checking account.

Technical support team, the manager at U.S. Bank in Cincinnati, and even the CEO of Travelex was unaware of why this situation happened. They all seemed to be very helpful in the beginning and concerned about my issue, but when it came down to taking action on fixing this issue, they were all on helpful. And yes, this is including the CEO, all very unhelpful on fixing the problem.

Finally after seven days when my money was returned into my checking account, I was advised the best way to upload money onto the card was NOT through the app but through the website.

I proceeded to upload 50 pounds from my checking account, and 100 pounds from a credit card. The same thing happened.

The money was withdrawn from my personal accounts, but not one penny had been uploaded onto the travelex card. 

I then proceeded to email the CEO and the bank manager at the Cincinnati US Bank branch, and I got no response.

I then proceeded to call the international line that‚Äôs located on the back of the Travelex card, but they were closed.

I then proceeded to call the US number on the back of the travelex card and I spoke with customer care; They put me on hold to reach the tech support people, however, they were closed. When I begin to ask when am I supposed to do about being in a foreign country having these kinds of troubles, the lady did not respond and just hung up on me; ended the phone call.

I will also note, that I was kind, friendly, and patient with each person that I spoke with over the phone, however not one person was helpful. And I still have over $200 pending withdraw from my personal accounts.

I highly recommend not using this card or this service of Travelex. I cannot make this up. If you want to save yourself from major problems while traveling, I highly recommend not using this service. 

I am not here to recommend any other service, or sell you on a bad experience, I am simply looking out for your well-being and letting you know my bad-experience that I had with customer care, and all the way up to the CEO of the company. | I went to Europe with the card and app. The card worked fine but every time I tried to reload it, the app wouldn‚Äôt work. It kept saying it had an ‚Äúerror‚Äù. Meanwhile in order to add more money to the card, you have to give so much personal information (like your SSN, etc.) all for an error! So I‚Äôm going to give you what might as well be my fingerprint for an app that doesn‚Äôt do what it‚Äôs meant to do? Makes no sense to me. I sent two emails to their ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù about the reloading issue, and it is now almost A MONTH LATER and they still have not replied. Save yourself the stress and do not download the app. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé | This app won‚Äôt let me reload my card, the login takes a comically long time and the general design is atrocious. One of the most aggravating apps I‚Äôve engaged with. | Loading money from the app is the reason I got this card but it doesn‚Äôt work. I was told that I have to wait 24 hours to reload the card, but it still will not reload through the app. Use the website to reload your instead of this app. | Nearly impossible to reload the card and when it says ‚Äúoops a problem occurred‚Äù it places a hold on your account that you are using to reload the card with. Just awful all the way around! Definitely do not recommend!!! | The only reason they get 1 star is because I can‚Äôt give them a fraction of a star. The app has not been working for over a week now making it very inconvenient to reload. After this trip I will be closing my account as it has not been user friendly at any point of my 3+ years as a client.

It bless his heart and if you guys have never gone to universal, I suggest strongly to do it because it was very cool there‚Äôs a lot of themes and yeah, but the app is just the best it tells you the times the food restaurants so I strongly strongly recommend going to universal and getting this app and if you have time but I did and I went to eat so do that if you any time it SeaWorld. | .z8 RT | Not helpful while in Universal | App design is terrible. The process for setting up guests and assigning g tickets is super confusing. Accidentally assigned a child ticket to an adult because it was so confusing. No apparent way to reassign them. Everything else is a similar mystery. | I love this app! It is easy to see where you are and what is near you. I came up with an idea that you can see where other people in your party are so you can meet up. Just an idea ‚ò∫Ô∏è | Had a blast watching 2 of my grandchildren had a blast 1 had been there a before so he was the tour guide. I can‚Äôt wait to come back. Thank you | Need to improve the Map experience to provide guidance on how to get to attractions from the current location. 

It is good to have the waiting times on the app. | Ordered a salad at 3:43 to pickup between 4:15-4:30.

Arrived at 4:35. Still not ready.

Arrived at 4:55 to inquire why it‚Äôs not ready‚Äî turns out it is, and it‚Äôs been sitting.

Still read as ‚Äúbeing prepared‚Äù On the app.

Follow through with your system. | Every time I go through the app, I am unable to make a reservation. When I tap ‚Äòconfirm reservation‚Äô it does not go through. This did not happen before the update | Amazing | For a park as sophisticated and interactive as Universal Studios you would think the app would pop and work well. Quite the opposite. Often hard to find help or information, make reservations, get info on ongoing and future events. Even if your a passholder nothing is personalized to make the experience better. Their website is just as bad so should be no shock the app is also. I‚Äôve never in almost 3 years completed a successful transaction via the app. | This is my first and LAST TIME going to Universal Studios Florida! Universal Studios has carnival ball throwing games, to take more of your money away!! Disgustingly cheap! - - - Haven‚Äôt been to the park since 2009. Came back on their deal of a 3 park visit for a low price. Currently my AP at DISNEY was set to expire. I gave universal a run for their money. IT WAS A FAILURE! The parks haven‚Äôt changed. There‚Äôs NO PAPER MAP! So if you don‚Äôt have the app downloaded. Or your phone dies. Your screwed. They have carnival rides that are DOUBLE THE PRICE then a traveling circus üé™ ü§° - - -  Universal/NBC/Comcast wants everyone who goes to their parks to look like a clown. ü§°- - -   I am going to renew my AP with Disney. And I even added on the 1 year of waterparks for $100 a year. Not a bad deal!! When one trip is $70. They are building a new park‚Ä¶ on new land. It will cost them BILLIONS! Disney laughs. They got the land ready to go. They will build a more action based park one day. It‚Äôs already on the drawing board. Let Universal do it, then Disney does it BETTER! üê≠üê≠üê≠ | This app needs real time walking directions. Some of the food places aren‚Äôt on the map (my son really wanted Central Park Crepes but it‚Äôs just not on the map!) | My most recent visit to universal was terrible. It rained the entire time. Most of the rides we wanted to go on were closed except hagrid. We waited in the rain and cold for 3 hours and just before it was our turn they shut down the ride so we had to leave. | Great app but it would be nice to sort the rides by favorite too. I don‚Äôt want to know wait times for ones that aren‚Äôt. Handy for in park use, planning, and ordering food. | Over sold the fast pass. | Universal forced me to download the app to order lunch because they don‚Äôt do in person ordering anymore. Every page asks you to give them permission for something else. By the time I actually place my order it‚Äôs 15 pages. Then I find out I have to make an account to order. All I want is to eat a chicken sandwich. Universal is making me sell them my soul in exchange | Good morning I just wanted to let you know that I am going to be in the office today to get my car fixed and I will be in the car for a little bit and then I will be in the house to pick up the car and then I will be home I will be there in about an hour and a half to get the car and then I will be back to the office and I will be in the office for a little while I will be in the office I love you and I hope you have a great day and I hope all your day and I hope you‚Äôre having a good day and I hope to see you soon bye love you bye see you bye love you bye love you see you guys bye love you bye love mom bye love you bye love dad eeeweeee bye love you bye love grandma bye love you bye love to you have a good day bye love you bye love and miss you bye love you bye talk | HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER HARRY POTTER   Also, I really enjoy using the app. I can find my way around easily. üòÅ | Love the park | this app is very good! when you have a big group this is the best way to see where you want to go and to see if you think everyone will ride the rides. my only question is if there is any way to only see rides no the water park. | The lines are very long so I went to upgrade for a fast pass. They wanted an additional $182.00.  So $400 just to visit the park.  Greedy. Also I had to store my fanny pack in a locker to go on a ride, Hagrids, Had to pay $3.00. The one at The Hulk was free.   I will say the park is beautiful | Must have for a visit to universal! It does everything and improves your visit | For $169.00 I would like a paper map!  Don‚Äôt mind an app for wait times but not user friendly to try and continually see where you are and where the next attraction is.  Will never come back! | I like universal very much hooray | Hice el proceso de compra de boletos, cobraron pero de boletos nada. | I copy from Minecraft | Despite Universal pushing for mobile ordering, the app will not let you do so unless you enable location tracking, which I am unwilling to do. | I downloaded the app and have tried every other day multiple times to make an account and it will not work. I really hope we won‚Äôt need it when we visit since it doesn‚Äôt work.. | I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but I regularly use to universal app and the new changes are mostly good. From the ease of us, I hope the developers change the size of the wait times in the app to be larger and easier to take a quick glance at. The small size of the font choice in the update is too small and I feel like my eyes are hunting for the information I am looking for in the app. It used to be much better and easier to see quickly how long of a wait for my favorite ride. Please change it back in some form! | Nice start to using this app.  The first thing it does is ask you to create an account.  But then it gives an ‚ÄúOops there‚Äôs an error in processing this request‚Äù. Over and over.  I uninstalled it and tried again with the same outcome over and over.  I see in other comments that is has been happening for years. | *Updated maps -

- Like the color codes area but when clicking on anything the map zooms in. That doesn‚Äôt help when you need a wide view to get from current spot to where you want to go. Please make it stop zooming in.

- When looking for dining/food only shows top tier hotels.  Stop trying to sway people to theses please! 

- There is a lag when scrolling. Gets ‚Äòstuck‚Äô on images. 

Overall- liked previous map much better. | There needs to be more directional signs!! Great fun otherwise!! A day well $pent. | User interface clunky 
Needs pinch zoom feature 
Wait times not always accurate 
Should have Single Rider info 
Should have ability to make table reservations at the park | The Value Resorts have been removed from the app. This is very inconvenient! | Actually a wonderfull experience for all the family, love it | Ever since the update, the app does not load past the initial loading screen. Just stays on ‚Äúuniversal Orlando resort‚Äù. Turned phone off and on, uninstalled and reinstalled, would never load past the first screen. With the app being the only way to order at mobile only locations and all maps being digital, you are restricted in what you can do. Brought this concern to the islands of adventure guest service desk and apparently all physical maps have ‚Äúdisappeared from existence so that we can save the planet‚Äù (his words) and we were told to wait in line at places like minions cafe to ‚Äúhopefully get helped‚Äù (again, his words). He then pulled his phone out, said his phone app worked and told me it must just be a problem with my phone.

Don‚Äôt expect help or solutions if you experience this same issue as I and my entire party experienced. | Since opening, my wife and I have enjoyed coming to universal at least once a year from our cold weather state.  Understanding that the world has changed in  that time,  getting though ticketing and the the primary gate of the studio continues to take more and more effort on every visit. Today took over a hour from getting in line to buy tickets and then final passing through the entrance. The fact that the que line for tickets was less than 100 total souls in it makes it even more disconcerting. I know we can get tickets on line that might help some but like today we are sitting at breakfast and it was a last minute decision. 20 minutes or even 30 would be acceptable on a busy day but an hour plus is not.  In an era where speed of execution is paramount, I feel like universal has failed at their initial point of contact with its guests. | We look forward to pre-ordering our donuts before we leave it‚Äôs a family tradition and now it‚Äôs not on the app to be able to order but the restaurant is still here and operating. If you tap on it in the map and select order it just errors out. What‚Äôs going on? | Ever since the new update my app won‚Äôt work at all gets stuck on logo screen and won‚Äôt do anything else, deleting and re adding app doesn‚Äôt fix anything, I am now stuck not being able to mobile order or view my tickets or see wait times or anything, never should have updated | It is NEVER working. Always delayed broken or something. | Been at Universal all day today and never got the app to work. Downloaded, deleted, restarted maybe 10x. Must be some bug because I‚Äôm pretty good with this stuff. | Too many steps to place a mobile table order
Had issues with the scanning and the staff had NO Clue how to assist.  Absolutely terrible! | I just downloaded this app today to use while I‚Äôm in the park. Bought my tickets yesterday and had them sent to my phone. Unfortunately I could not open an log in because it kept saying ‚Äúoops something went wrong. Please try your request again later‚Äù. It has been doing this all day. I was not even able to order my food online. They tell you you have to order your food online through the app, but then the app tells you to sign in and that‚Äôs where the trouble is. I tried resetting my password twice, and it still doesn‚Äôt work. Honestly, I‚Äôm at a loss. I can‚Äôt recommend this app to anybody. | You need to add the ability to sort your favorite rides by wait time | Too much $ and too few attractions. Many of the standout attractions have been replaced with stores and eateries. | Doesn‚Äôt cache your tickets, so you have to wait for them every time to use them. Should integrate with Apple Wallet like the other resorts. You can ‚Äúheart‚Äù things, but what is the point as you can‚Äôt filter or sort for that? Complete failure. Navigation for reading menus is pretty inconsistent from one dining location to the next. No easy way to search for specific food options for truly picky kids.  When you use dietary filters for dining it instead shows rides?! Complete failure to serve the purpose. | The newest update 6.0 is not working. It just loads the logo and then nothing else works. Don‚Äôt download it or upgrade until the figure out this bug. I am going to the parks next week hopefully they will have it fixed by then. | Loved the app, but it won‚Äôt load anymore, and we have a trip coming up soon it‚Äôs very disappointing, I‚Äôve tried everything from, deleting and reinstalling to resetting my phone‚Ä¶ | Worked the first day in the park and now it will not load. I have restarted. I have deleted and reloaded.

This is a EULA that is illegal in the United States. | I‚Äôve used clime for years and through several hurricane seasons in Florida. But the recent decision by the developer to increase the cost to almost $15 a month (33 percent) is ridiculously expensive. 

It‚Äôs a great app but the cost no longer makes it reasonable to keep paying for. 

Goodbye. | This app by far has the best n reliable weather forecast n all kinds of added features for  anywhere and any time ! | Kil√≥metros d La Habana playa hasta reparto electrico | My other weather app just went radical, so I‚Äôm hoping I can now depend on this. Map nice, but does it include sunrise & sunset?  Need to know weather in other parts of the world. | Something told my mom to check her Clime subscription. IT WENT FROM $9.99 a year to $59.99 a year for the premium! If my mom had not have checked, we would have been paying $63.00 for that. It is not worth it. CLIME? YOU ARE DIRTY, LOW, AND SNEAKY. I WILL NEVER EVER USE ANYTHING THAT HAS THE CLIME NAME AND DEVELOPERS AGAIN. YOU ARE AS BAD AS THE IAP PURCHASES. IF APPLE KNOWS YOU ARE QUIETLY INCREASING THE CUSTOMERS PRICE LIKE THAT AND NOT TELLING THEM? CLIME YOU AND APPLE SHOULD HAVE A LAW SUIT BROUGHT AGAINST YOU. I AM STRONGLY CONSIDERING CLOSING MY APPLE ACCOUNT AND GOING WITH ANOTHER PHONE CARRIER. CLIME? YOU AND APPLE HAVE VERY DIRTY BUSINESS METHODS. I‚Äôm sure this review will get deleted. And I will write again. | Sometimes it works! Sometimes it doesn't! Sometimes you can resurrect it with an app delete/reinstall! Sometimes (like right now) the widget is completely gone and you can't even re-add it to your Home Screen on your phone! But it shows up on an iPad of the same OS version!

I'm out. Tho it did just renew (before they decided to play ""What are we charging for it today?"") so I have a while until it stops ""working"" I guess. But it was targeting $40/year next billing, so I'll be looking elsewhere. | The precipitation descriptions IE drizzle, rain showers etc ‚Ä¶ are never accurate. Drizzle means the sidewalks are wet and your glasses are misty but you might sneak by without an umbrella if it‚Äôs not a long walk. It‚Äôs says drizzle when we are getting hail. Drizzle when it rains an inch. Drizzle when we have cloud bursts , then sun. It‚Äôs just not accurate or nuanced. | This app is great but going from 29.99/year to 79.99/year is absolutely absurd! I enjoyed this app for several years but I‚Äôm sorry, a $50 increase is ludicrous. | This is without a doubt, the most accurate app I have had at 6800ft!   Just a little improvement for snow vs rain in a timely manner.  Like it‚Äôs been snowing not raining today!  So glad for this terrific app!üëçüèª | Regularly doesn‚Äôt load, regularly doesn‚Äôt show accurate weather especially compared to other free apps, price is ridiculous for the actual limited value you receive. Will never pay for this app again. | I liked using this app to track stormy weather and believed $19.99 was an okay price to pay per year to get the data; however, they automatically increased the price to $69.99 without my knowledge. I had originally signed up for this app for and agreed upon $19.99 a year to be able to access all features and happily paid for the last few years, but noticed the huge price increase to $69.99 when I was managing my subscriptions. I attempted to reach out to the developer a few times via email for clarification on the large price increase, but only received a bot response that they were restructuring their support department. Since I have not gotten a reason why it‚Äôs worth so much more, I have cancelled my subscription and suggest others double check theirs to make sure there are no surprises at renewal time. | in app purchase and advertisements ü§Æ | Easy to view, takes a bit more than common sense to get the details | Maybe the change preceded Bending Spoon‚Äôs takeover, I can‚Äôt be sure, but I checked today and found my annual subscription renewal in July will cost 6 times what it had been. Kind of follows what they‚Äôve done with Evernote ‚Äî and now I need to check Robokiller which they also just bought. Bending Spoons is bad news!

No brainer, my Clime renewal is canceled. | Have had this App over 10 years. Features I used disappeared or changed so stopped using it. Thanks for raising the price of Subscription X2, brought it to my attention. Now I no longer have Subscription. | Just bad. Too many ads. Doesn‚Äôt update radar | In a world where we pay for literally everything. There is no point in paying for this. It‚Äôs a good service but so expensive. Might as well just look up radar on your phone. | Excellent app with accurate information. $2.99 per week was steep but not ridiculous. $5.99 per week is too much. | Used to use this app frequently for work purposes as a third opinion on the weather. After the price increase I did not see any value in what they are charging. Nice design and information but for that price I‚Äôd rather just go to Carrot Weather. | Great app but they haven‚Äôt responded or fixed the lightning tracker display after 6 support emails. Why do i pay for the extra features. Fix the app or give me my money back. NOW!!!

 According to your app currently, there isn‚Äôt one single lightning bolt on the entire earth‚Ä¶ i doubt that. | Cancel immediately! | An apparently new data manager of this program has put up a wall demanding acceptance of changed terms and conditions (massive data hoovering that would embarrass Zuckerberg and mandatory binding arbitration of disputes, which always favor the business) or stop using the program. It offers a ùíèùíêùíè-ùíòùíêùíìùíåùíäùíèùíà email address in Italy for opting out. Their pocketing about half a year's subscription (not cheap) is theft. This is a dishonest broker, Clime will, in time, regret its customer abuse in this fiasco. Apple should consider removing them from the App Store. | $19.99 - $69.99 this app has been great; honestly no crazy complaints. HOWEVER the $50 increase is insane. I cannot justify how that much price increase would be necessary | I use this app daily but it went from $9.99 to 14.99. That‚Äôs quite an increase. | I‚Äôve enjoyed this app for several years. $19.99 was a fair amount to pay every year. But I just got the notification that when my plan renews next month, the will price increase from $19.99 to $69.99 and my mouth hit the counter. That‚Äôs a 250% price increase. Cancelling and deleting app. | have used the app for a couple of years, and its been a good value for $20/yr. price was bumped to $70/yr, and its not worth it at that level so i‚Äôve cancelled my subscription | I live in a small town. Heat index/wind chill is set the same. The readers have to be relatively close to each other, but this is always 5-10 degrees off. Meh‚Ä¶ | This is a useless app. And worse it will not let a user unsubscribe. This is a scam | There‚Äôs not even an ‚ÄúI Agree‚Äù checkbox. If you use it, you‚Äôve agreed to lose it (your privacy). It‚Äôs not a matter of them using anonymous data or payment details (which Apple covers, anyway, and which they should protect).  It‚Äôs beyond the Oh Well, Every Company Is Doing It level. And my subscription was paid up through June! I‚Äôd given it 4 stars last summer and have used it for years. If only there was a minus-four stars rating. I canceled and deleted it on all devices before anyone used it and am hoping they honor the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Use‚Äù option. But I am cynical - like too many other companies they get to set their rules to We Can Do Anything We Want With and To You. They have farmed out their policies setup to Bendable Spoons, a separate company. Criminy. Find a different app with more simple and fair terms. And don‚Äôt forget to delete (not just ‚Äúremove‚Äù Clime on all devices and turn location access to Never. I want a subscription button for Cease And Desist: The App Will Immediately Delete All My Personal Data. Apple, figure it out! | I know this is not the place but I am steamed.  I am cheap and use the free version of the Apple app. It meets my needs and I am quite satisfied.  I recommend the app to friends frequently.
I recommended the Clime App to my Android husband.  That version is completely unusable as it plays multiple full screen ads every time he tries to scroll in or out on a map.  The android app absolutely stinks and is garbage.  Don‚Äôt offer it to your Android friends.  I tell him to get an Apple phone but he hasn‚Äôt done that yet.  I hope this gets to the Clime Developers. | This is a great app but the Home Screen widget has stopped working completely. It was a great way to glance at the weather without having to enter the full App. I hope it will be fixed soon. | This app used to be amazing. I didn‚Äôt mind paying for it, but now it‚Äôs 14.99 and it won‚Äôt even load, it‚Äôs slow, and isn‚Äôt what it used to be. The update they did was horrible. | I‚Äôve had this app for years. Now it absolutely will not load until you accepted a free trial.  Which turns into a paid subscription.  So I deleted it. | I loved this app for its lightning tracker. It had icons letting you know locations of lightning strikes. It was a determining factor in buying the app or getting a subscription‚Ä¶ but one day, that went away. I reached out to the developer for a fix but was ignored. The lightning tracker will still send you notifications that there is lightning near, but the map no longer shows the location icons.  Wish that would change back. Not too sure this app is worth the money for me anymore though. | Logiciel tr√®s d√©velopp√© | Screw you. A 50% price increase for this app is UNACCEPTABLE!  It was not really worth $9.99, but now $14.99? EAT A BAG OF DxxS!!! | Guys check the weather they'll add you'll be fine if there's tornadoes meat this app | This app is great and helped me in a life or death storm, but there is one big problem I CANNOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, there is absolutely zero key or even a compass!!!!\_/(‚Äú/)\_/ | This app, with its wind direction and lightning tracker glitches, now wants to raise the yearly price by 250%. Even worse, the new ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù terms allow recording of your speech, typing, eye tracking, etc., and full access to everything on your phone. Do as I just did‚Äîremove it from your phone. | Using the latest app version & repeatedly receiving this error over the last few hours‚Ä¶ | ÿßÿØÿßÿ© ÿ±ÿµÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ŸàŸÇ ŸÑÿß ÿ™ÿπŸÖŸÑ ŸÖÿß ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßÿÆÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´ÿßÿ™ | It was so accurate at first then it started being off on weather not even close the location keep giving me wrong place where I was .  Not worth the money | Used to love this app, lately it‚Äôs been inaccurate and not updating. | I don‚Äôt know why this gets so many good reviews. It plainly just doesn‚Äôt work. | Can‚Äôt open app | Shockingly poor weather predictions! | I like this app, easy to find the info I need, well laid out. But I live in the Great Lakes area, where the wind can and does change direction frequently and can mean nasty weather is on its way. So having no wind direction takes it down by one star. Thanks for an otherwise great app. | This was a pretty good app for weather. Now they expect you to pay for it.

Their company policy though is just terrible: I just bought 12 airplane tickets with them, and I made a mistake in one of the passengers‚Äô last name, which I caught immediately, so I contacted customer support and they want me to pay ‚Ç¨125 to fix it!
No one has been able (or wanted to) help me by chat, and to try to connect to a supervisor I need to call a UK number, which for me is international, so probably not worth it.

If is unlikely that me and my team will use RyanAir ever again. | Their policies are made for customers to responsible for all issues even their fault. I highly doubt they make those tech glitches on purpose, then they have reason to charge you as fines. $180 tickets when reservation made, $460 is the final bill so far. It might charge me more because It‚Äôs a round trip and I haven‚Äôt fully the 2nd trip yet. I did everything strictly followed their detections. | All the payment methods didn‚Äôt work. Credit cards, Apple Pay, or PayPal. None of them worked. | It will not let me pick Atlanta | It declines my payment and then cancels my booking. Used the chat feature, waited, got a representative, and then they just ended the chat without providing any assistance and then I was placed back in queue to wait again. Booked with another airline since it was too much hassle. | Say what you will about the airline‚Äîtheir app design is just dreadful. The frequency with which the app does not find a booking automatically and the slowness of the Retrieve Booking feature are disappointing at best. However, the shortcomings that is most egregious is the fragility of the booking flow! Should the user‚Äîand prospective customer‚Äîhave the temerity to switch apps for a few seconds to verify their plans comport with something in an e-mail or calendar, the booking flow is aborted, forcing the user to start over from zero. Note that this is not a question of five minutes inactivity, or even three: thirty seconds is all it takes. That such an obvious use case is ignored is‚Ä¶a shame.

(Using the Sign-in with Apple feature is another disaster, but I shall not further digress here‚Ä¶)

Running an airline is hard, but designing a decent booking app is‚Ä¶well, not nearly as hard.  Software design isn‚Äôt easy, but surely Ryanair could do better if they put forth a modicum of effort. | I have been booking my flights through their app and each time I book my flights, an our or two later they will block my flights stating I bought from a third party and I need to verify my documents. It‚Äôs strange considering I purchased the tickets through their own app. I am trying to pay the small fee to verify my documents and the app keeps on rejecting it. I have tried calling customer support multiple times and no luck. | The app would not let me check in before my flight even though I tried multiple days before and hours before. Then I was charged for late check in at the airport because their app didn‚Äôt work! Terrible service. | Application does not accept payments or make reservations.  Clearly just an email harvesting scam that was never intended to work. | Flight delayed by over 90 mins. Gate was changed 5 times (yes five). Ryanair app didn't update any gate changes correctly or in a timely manner. | Everything was okay making the initial flight bookings with the App; However, when i tried to check-in on my return flight using the Ryanair App and website they were both down/not working. As i wasn‚Äôt able to check-in, I arrived at the airport and needed Ryanair employees to issue my flight ticket, but since I couldn‚Äôt check in online they made me pay for my airline tickets again (for the seats I already paid for). As i was with my family and in a foreign country, and it was the only flight back i had to pay. This is also called Criminal Extortion. In spite of my complaints to Ryanair, they didn‚Äôt care that their website was down, apparently I needed to take screenshots and find a phone number to call.

Either way, beware of using this App. If it‚Äôs down or not working Ryanair is happy to extort you for more money. They accepted no responsibility for their site being down.

Issue wasn‚Äôt my phone either, as i was able to make other payments, uber pickup, etc.  without any issues on my phone all that morning/afternoon. Also, I had all the appropriate software updates and whatnot. | It‚Äôs all about you fckng updates! It‚Äôs annoying | This would be a nice simple and generally functional app if it were not for the fact that I get frequent notifications for promotions and special offers. There is no way to turn them off so I am deleting the app. Shame on you Ryanair. | Service nul | This app abuses the notification system to send ads and promotions. Would be nice to keep them turned on for actually useful things like flight information updates, but that isn‚Äôt really possible unless you enjoy being spammed. | I would like everyone to know before using this app that every single step along the way of getting tickets (to even cancelling/changing times because they messed up my flight time) has been a complete failure on Ryanair‚Äôs side of things, and I am utterly disappointed and frustrated that no matter what flight I use with them, nothing ever works. I went through Skyscanner to get a connecting flight from Menorca to Barcelona and then from Barcelona to Sevilla, and one would think you would need the later flight to be from Barcelona to Sevilla, but no, despite the fact that I triple checked the time of the first flight, Ryanair decided with their bountiful knowledge and wisdom and common sense to schedule the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù flight several hours after the second. How does this work? Not sure! Ask Ryanair. If I could get a refund, I would. Until then, I‚Äôll warn you all to never use this awful app. | Was trying to check in ahead of time but it would only give me the option to select a luggage that is up-charged, even though the receipt had already said I paid for my luggage. Was charged an extra $124 because I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù ahead of time. Then was told by the check in counter that both of my bags were okay in size, only to have to pay an additional 48‚Ç¨ at the gate because my bag was ‚Äúover sized‚Äù. Also, the representative at the gate stated that I need to make my bag smaller and when I said I could not she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like arguing right now‚Äù. 
Terrible service ): | Booked a flight, a few hours to boarding, but was unable to get my boarding pass. When you book with a third party booking Company, to get the boarding pass printed, the app throws up a webpage window for you to add extended verification. Ended up in a endless loop. No way to get the boarding pass. When I finally got it to work in a real browser, it was too close to takeoff and I would have to find a Ryan air sales assistant counter and pay a fine.

Also Absolutely sinister pricing structure, swiping thru pages of extra optional fees - only booked Ryanair due to the great timing and end airport. Pricing was not important.

Rebooked in the SAS app - which is great by the way. | I already paid for two checked bags, as it‚Äôs shown in my receipt, and in the process iof checking in , it was requested to specify if I would carry checked bags.
Please clarify this.
My receipt said for each of us
Vivian‚Ä¶ checked bag (20kg)
Luis‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.checked bag (20kg) | I‚Äôve been trying to find a link for wheelchair assistance for hours. Unless you pay for a specific seat, I guess I don‚Äôt have the option. | All functions of app can be completed online with no risk of personal information being leaked. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. You still will not get your boarding pass. | The app crashes when switching the app to find  your passport number or other information. It also does not tell you when you‚Äôve already purchased additional bags. Instead, it tries to upswell you even more check-in bags. Bad app and customer-hostile company. | Ryanair site is designed to constantly upsell. | No Los Angeles no US no Philippines | I remember when we had to print our tickets and I‚Äôd have to run around the city looking for a printer. The app is so much easier and I love the check in process online. Ryanair is definitely up to speed when it comes to tech üíØ | APP would not allow us to change seats. And chat thru the APP did not work. Wouldn‚Äôt fly Ryanair if I had ANY other airline choice. | Useless app. Why are we forced to download it. To justify building it? Waste of resources | I am a first time customer. My receipt 3 months ago has line item charge for carry on and small bag. Why create a sense of uncertainty by offering charges for same baggage at check in time. I suggest getting smarter about previous related purchase and make effort to assess if additional service & charge is warranted exercise. | I avoid Ryan as much as possible. One reason is the confusing check in process which is designed to make you buy services you may not need. It‚Äôs their business model, but it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating and makes me take other carriers whenever I can. | Company ask to get early. Long lines and you get to the counter to check in an they do not let you check in because your plane do not depart within 2 hours. Then, they send you to make again a lane of 30 min wait. What a disaster planning with the airline | I just paid 62 Euro per person to check into a flight that was paid for long in advance. I was not aware that phone check in is now mandatory or else stiff fines. Terrible terrible policy | Great app!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | I wish I knew about 3rd party issues for booking | Extremely complicated check in process. The opposite of many airlines They try to sell you everything up the the ladt click and you probably need ten clicks to get to a check in with high possibilities of errors. When the ticket is cheaper YOU are the product. Remember | Working good user frendly | They make you take multiple pictures and charge for ‚Äúverification ‚Äú. It took multiple tried. They charged me twice even though I had attempts left. I only booked their flights because no other airlines were available. 
I have many years of programming experience. I have seen so user unfriendly app as their ‚Äúverification ‚Äú. | I paid to check my bag in advance when booking . I received a notice that had to check in online to avoid a fee in the airport. The app will not allow you to check in without paying for bags, even though I already paid for bags.

Insane!!! | I was not able to move forward with the check in unless I selected a seat and it made me pay for that. I would have happily taken a random seat | The app doesn‚Äôt pull already selected preferences correctly at the checkin time. It should provide an option, ‚Äú keep the existing selection‚Äù | Clunky app to check-in with limited information about what you already have paid for. Not very customer friendly. We fly RyanAir as a last resort. | I have to allow access to my camera to verify my identity but I don‚Äôt have the ability through the app to even access or give access to the camera. This is extortion of the highest order in order for them to charge more fees for check-in ‚Ç¨55 is ridiculous to check in. | The fact that we have to install an app to check in is so stupid.  They should let us check in online. | Should be an example of how not to run an airline an embarrassment to the Irish | It's easy and cheap to make this experience straightforward | You asked me for an expiration date on my Polish identity card. It doesn‚Äôt have one DJ ce when you are as old as I am78 they give a card without expiry date. | I hate Ryanair and since it‚Äôs between them and Wizz air I had no choice. Thank goodness I‚Äôm still young and can figure this stuff out. I feel bad for old people | Ryanair is generally very inventive about scamming its customers but their app takes it to a new level. The app kept failing when I tried to use it to check in for a flight. The I got to the gate and they refused to check me in for free and charged me ‚Ç¨165 for check in. Told me that I should have called customer support when the app didn‚Äôt work!!! | Most frustrating asinine airline ever that does everything it can to complicate the flying experience, frustrate its passengers and generally provide the worst traveling experience ever. | Horrible use of app. Redundant and useless | I paid for a checked bag and doesn‚Äôt appears in my ticket",4.55811,50682,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5f/49/60/5f4960f5-1f45-30db-3c62-61a382d533f9/3d370e5b-62c3-411c-a8b3-48f0712b5f2a_English_-_Home_-_IOS_1242_x_2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/39/c6/96/39c69600-b864-b09c-70aa-18b153fc318b/4baef9d2-27e4-43a4-a382-f6a46bc3e9ef_English_-_Active_Trip_-_IOS_1242_x_2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/e6/f1/41/e6f141f4-3a2c-e783-17c0-f41bb5313dfc/8ada58e8-ea9b-4403-b10f-9d6d91132bae_English_-_Boarding_Pass_-_IOS_1242_x_2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/d4/5c/ee/d45cee7f-3ce2-1026-30ff-73bd6b4c1841/bdb29d03-c692-4f83-91ab-c20eb65cd0dc_English_-_DOT_-_IOS_1242_x_2208.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I‚Äôve never encountered such incompetence in my entire life. I tried to create an account multiple times using different emails, and guess what? It was an exercise in futility. The app kept throwing errors at me like confetti at a failed party.

I followed every single instruction to the letter, but the app apparently has its own twisted logic that makes it impossible for normal human beings to sign up. It‚Äôs like they designed it specifically to torture people who just want to use their services.

The user experience? Non-existent. And don‚Äôt get me started on the functionality. Oh wait, what functionality? It‚Äôs as useful as a screen door on a submarine.

Save yourself the headache and frustration. Don‚Äôt waste your time on this dumpster fire of an app. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to my worst enemy. Do yourself a favor and find something else that actually works and respects your time. | Cannot sign into account. Keeps giving error message and no matter how many times I reset my password it does the same thing. Worthless app. | I have way too many issues with this app never communicating with the servers. I have alot of stresses as a truck driver and getting fuel with this app is one of them. | This app is terrible! Always crashes on me, logs me out. Fuel in the app never works, I waste 5 minutes trying to set everything up and then it crashes at the end, 90% of the time I use it. I‚Äôm at the point where I dread using this app! | I have an older phone and cannot download the New version so I can not get all my points for Fueling why try to fix what was not broken. | This app doesn‚Äôt work, at least half of the time. It either says ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù and won‚Äôt log me in. I usually have to reboot the app. At that point, sometimes it will work‚Ä¶sometimes it won‚Äôt. As of the last 3 days, I open the app, to get fuel. Now it says ‚ÄúMobil fueling unavailable‚Äù. I‚Äôm sick of it and about to the point of deleting it. This has been going on for the last year. | After the update, the application constantly crashes, I have to enter the code that is sent by email, it is very inconvenient. Fix please. | Does not allow me to update! | ‚ÄúMobile Fueling Not Available‚Äù Have a nice day! For OK and IL Consistency!!! Card declined on app. Works fine on pump in PA | Now I have a iPhone 7 and it want support the 6.0 update you have, so I would have to buy a new phone but I don‚Äôt think so, I really love pilot and now I can‚Äôt log in to it to check my points, Shower availability, or add missing points, so I guess I will have to find another option and I really don‚Äôt want to look else where, can you please fix this so I can use my phone, Thanks JWD1 | Often times when I stop at flying J and pilot to fuel through the app instead using the card because it‚Äôs convenient and time efficient the app doesn‚Äôt work and shows ‚Äúwe‚Äôre having trouble communicating with the server‚Äù I do update it regularly and I deleted and reinstalled the app countless times no change hope they can fix this problem soon. I use all TA/Petro, Loves&PilotflyingJ by far PilotflyingJ has poorest performance! | Guys be aware flying j / pilot will rip you off on your points today i used my reward card and got zero points same thing last month i used my reward card at the pump and got zero points, you guys should be shame of your self | I‚Äôve used this app for years, but now I‚Äôm blocked out. My iPhone 7Plus uses iOS 15.8.2, but your latest app update requires 
IOS 16 or later.  So now I can no longer find your locations while I‚Äôm on the road.  I guess I‚Äôm going to have to switch to Love‚Äôs. | Cut some of the bling, fancy animations. This trucker prefers meat and potatoes. | As a truck driver I use the app for a lot s
Of its  features. But lately every time I go to use the in app fueling it tells me it‚Äôs having connectivity issues and I‚Äôll have full service or even connected to WiFi and it still tells me that. It‚Äôll let me do everything else on the app but pay for my fuel. I‚Äôd be willing to give the app five stars if it was reliable, but I can‚Äôt because I never know when the mobile fueling function is going to work | The application always works incorrectly!! Optimize it!!! | The Home Screen doesn‚Äôt show the number of people waiting for a shower before me. And also it keeps showing too many annoying popups when I‚Äôm trying to get to the fueling page | You have a bug or something wrong with your app. I‚Äôve been trying 2 days to log in, change password and it sends me back to the App Store. Please fix it. I‚Äôm traveling and need to know where to stop. Thanks | I swear this app doesn‚Äôt work whenever you want to use it. It just keeps loading and loading. | Everything is communication issue with server. Can‚Äôt add my points, fuel card, or do mobile fueling. Complete waste of time. | Trying to add a card to the wallet in this app is absolutely a pain. Always showing the message we have problem connecting with our servers. You are making a lot of money and cannot build a top tier app. | Why do we as drivers have to pre activate our points each month?
Why can‚Äôt it be automatic as we buy fuel? 
Can we have one less hoop to jump through? | I changed my email address two years ago and ever since I haven‚Äôt been able to use the mobile app to fuel. I get emails and messages from you all the time but still not able to use the mobile app to fuel, I have to do it manually at the pump. I called several times to the help desk for help and they said give it a few days before trying again but yet I still can‚Äôt fuel through the mobile app so naturally I‚Äôm frustrated with the issue so I‚Äôve never tried calling the help desk anymore..Other than this issue I love the app and all of the stations I fuel at the staffs are great to deal with‚Ä¶Thanks for your concern‚Ä¶ | Waste of time always crash | The remote pump activation can be picky working correctly the first attempt about 70% of the time. Please add what dining options are available at the locations. Dennys, subway, Arby‚Äôs, etc. | This app is as garbage as the stores. At least half the time you‚Äôre trying to fuel, reserve, or add a card there always seem to be issues. 
‚ÄúOops we‚Äôre having trouble communicating with our servers. Please try again.‚Äù 
Logging out or even redownloading the app won‚Äôt fix this issue and it‚Äôs a constant problem. It‚Äôs a shame my company only has us fuel here because Pilot/Flying J is the worst chain by far. | The app is trash. | The app keeps telling me I need to update and requires iOS 16 or later I have iOS 15.8 please fix | Doesn‚Äôt work! | I had to delete this app from my phone, first they hacked my fuel card , we got that taken care of and next they hacked my personal debit card I had stored on this app  . Beware if you store your financial information on this app it will probably get hacked and you‚Äôll lose money | This app repeatedly freezes up. Please fix this. The Love‚Äôs app always works. Ask them how to get you app working consistently. I have to remove then reload weekly. This is annoying. When the app will load , it is good to go. I am a trucker, I hope you work to fix this app. | I have been using this app for a long time to fuel my truck and track my reward points. I have noticed over the last six or eight months. The stability of this app has continued to decline. Despite having excellent cell phone coverage, network connectivity, I am repeatedly, unable to use this app to pre-authorize for fuel, or reserve a shower. It is almost to the point where I‚Äôm going to start fueling somewhere else as this app has a little to no value to me at this point in time due it‚Äôs stability. Every time I try to authorize fuel. I am greeted with a message. ‚ÄúWe are having difficulty communicating with our servers right now.‚Äù | I had been saving points for years! I bought a few things here and there but always tried to keep a lot of points for a rainy day. Well their system screws up and I am unable to use my points. I contacted gues services and they said they would have to crest a new account and they can just move everything over so I can keep all my points and everything. After everything is said and done they would only give me $400 of my nearly $700 in points because they said they couldn‚Äôt find them. I took a screenshot of my points before hand to prove it to them, sent it to them and they still wouldn‚Äôt give them to me.  Beware if you have too many points they will screw you out of them!!! | Conveniently always has trouble connecting at the pump | This app use to be user  friendly, first on many things that we use every day. NOT anymore, this app now have network problems all the time when you are going to fuel, crashes it and ask you for more information that it‚Äôs save on your profile even though you are using Face ID. Like I said use to be excellent and leader not anymore. | The app sends you an email to confirm your email address and when you click the button that says ‚Äòcomplete your registration‚Äô you have to start registration all over again ‚Ä¶ and then it sends you an email to confirm your email address and when you click the button in that email, you have to start all over again‚Ä¶ And again‚Ä¶ And again. 

(Doesn‚Äôt matter whether you choose ‚Äòlogin‚Äô and hope it recognizes you, or you click the register here button. Either way, you end up having to start over.) | Because I have an older phone I am unable to update the app. I would appreciate at the very least have the option to keep an older version so I can at least use the app. | Pilot limits the use to IOS 16+ users. My present phone will only load up to 15.8.
It‚Äôs not worth it. | Every other fuel stop I get this message: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre having trouble communicating with our servers‚Äô. After the third try it blocks me saying TOO MANY ATTEMPTS and instructs me to pay inside or swipe at the pump. What‚Äôs the point of using the app for convenience when it fails constantly and wastes your time? I WISH my company allowed us to use other truck stops! Petitioning now them to switch to Loves. | It is very annoying when you have to enter the password all the time. It is especially annoying when the program says that the password is incorrect, but you are sure that the password is correct. | I am a truck driver and I don‚Äôt have time to deal with nonsense app‚Äôs in order to earn the points I deserve by doing business with Pilot / Flying J.
Nor do I want to be tracked by this company or anyone else out there in space.  Why can you not just make it simple like your competitor (Love‚Äôs)  and when we use our rewards card give us the points we deserve instead of trying to force us to download an app to our phones in order to earn the most points. Also why don‚Äôt we get free refills after 50 gallons plus fuel like Love‚Äôs does or after so many gallons of fuel we get unlimited refills.  I only get fuel with y‚Äôall because my company now has changed their fuel preferences. | Right now i have latest iphone i reserve shower the shower ready just flickers so i cant get shower number or code that can be annoying. also since lastest update to allow notifications on android and apple i dont seem to get notifed when shower is ready. Also not sure if this is an apple thing but have to go to maps then dezl on android you can get pilot address then dezl | Get communication errors all the time.  I tried to reserve a parking spot in Corbin KY about 100 miles down road. I called ahead just to make sure and was told if some one who didn‚Äôt reserve spot parks there they will not make them move and I have to move on and lose my parking fee. So how does that provide peace of mind as they promote for these reserved spots? That basically makes it worthless for planning ahead. What a joke . | I love the app for mobile fueling but it don‚Äôt work half the time ! I‚Äôm bout to just start going to loves for my fuel!!! | I got a new fuel card, added it and of course it tells me that I have to use the pump first before it will add. I respect that. That was back on Jan 18th 2024. Here it is, February 11th and still won‚Äôt add my card after using it several times, this is ridiculous. Called customer service several times and all they do is give the run around. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled the app, redid my password servers times and still can‚Äôt won‚Äôt accept my company fuel card? Really? The only thing it wants to say is it may take up to 24hrs when it‚Äôs been almost a month and customer service sits there like they got a thumb up their‚Ä¶‚Ä¶yeah not acceptable. Y‚Äôall need to get it together and get it fix. Your acting like the flying j now and I enjoy fuel at both. Fix the situation, I‚Äôll fix my rating, until then, it stands where it is 1 star. | Used to be good now I have to log everytime I open the app | app keeps not letting me fuel saying my account is flagged as suspicious | I signed up with my phone number and have used it for months at the pump. Today, I stopped in Lordsburg, NM and the card reader at the pump was out of order. So, I had to go into the store to pre-pay for fuel. Well, I was unable to put my phone number in so I downloaded the app. When I went to register my account with the app, I got stuck in this loop where it sent me a confirmation email. When I hit the link, it said it didn‚Äôt recognize the account so I tried to reset my password and got stuck again in the loop wanting me to download the app, which I had already done. How frustrating can you make this?  I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs with the .05 I save, when the stupid card readers are working. So, I‚Äôve got no account set up, an app I can‚Äôt delete (thanks Apple üôÑ) and I didn‚Äôt get my discount.  Keep your app. | Consistent unusual activity on your account every other day.

Thank you üôèüèæüôèüèæ | Affordable | Much better than I expected. The staff was very kind and professional | Payment issues and customer service and add-on fees are the worst!! | I love Spirit airlines. Not only are they affordable but they are consistently on time and have great crews who are friendly and cheerful! | Wish the bag didn‚Äôt cost so much | Veterans are as important as active military. They served their time‚Ä¶ they should continually be appreciated! | Had to call customer service to ask about why card would not go through and customer service said they could release my reservation and rebook for $60 more. Why would someone pay the extra to rebook if I could redo the reservation for the original price. I have never had a great experience with Spirit. I have had my flight cancelled and was supposedly given a credit but wasn‚Äôt able to use it because it said it was expired, even though the expiration date was for 2 months later. I always fly a different airline but the flight time and date was the only available. | Excelente precio y servicio. | El precio est√° elevado | I tried to upgrade my seats. When I went to your method payment I kept getting an error. Oops somethings wrong. Try again later. I tried again five times. So now I can‚Äôt upgrade my seat because your website is so terrible. | I have had a few bad run ins with Spirit in the past none of the experiences have been good, but I decided to give them another try and it wasn‚Äôt bad at all, it was actually a good experience and a smooth flight‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm coming to realize it‚Äôs not the airlines but the workers, they may need to screen their workers better ü´£ü•¥ | In person, (ATL) not so good. | My daughter and I had an amazing experience with spirit airlines. We will always fly spirit!!! Thank you and a shout out to all the staff. | Buenos precios y servicios | I am just so thankful that a seat is included in the ticket fare. 
Next improvement in how this jaundiced carrier collects is mandating a fee for a seat‚Äî otherwise plane passengers will stand up hanging on to a strap from the ceiling. 
Gotta love the Spirit! | I hate your app! There‚Äôs always a problem and this time it would accept of my credits cards. | The first time I flew Spirit I will admit I was scare that was back in 2017. It is very impressive how far this airline has come. I used to avoid them at all cost now I look forward to flying on them. Impressive work. | I enjoy travel with SPIRIT, because is amazing experience.
All perfect. | No free seats available and the seats allotment system is very poor. For a family of 4, which includes 2 kids the last seats were allocated with not a single window seat. | At some point during your first account creation and flight setup, somewhere in the hundreds of extra fees and charges and notification it tries to send you it automatically signs you up for their $70 yearly membership. You will have no idea this happened and get charged a year later. Scummy, but it‚Äôs spirit, we know this. | You must wait 24 hr before to the minute and it is very easy and a check in button will be there at that time | Every time I try to book or purchase short cut security I get the most aggravating message. Oops there seems to be a problem try again later! Very frustrating. | Why do they make sign in impossible. Password is always wrong. Never sends a reset email. User never exists!!! | Have tried to reserve a seat multiple times over 3 days and keep getting the message ‚ÄúOops, something went wrong ‚Äú | We booked bc it was the only direct flight to Puerto Rico. Every step has been a challenge from being told I would have to pay $250 to correct a name misspelling, which was simply adding an ‚Äúr‚Äù , which 2 hours and a FB message later I did not. Not sure why they nickle and dime you every step of the way. we are paying just under 1k per ticket. Praying the flight goes well, I time with no delays. | I have not been able to talk to anyone about information I need, and the chat feature just ran me around in circles. I received a 900 refund on a flight cancelled by Spirit, and I was only able to use 700. We I talked to customer service, I was hung up on when I was transferred to a manager. It has been a disappointing experience with Spirit. | That‚Äôs rediculous! And it‚Äôs not even an upgrade! How crazy is that?! | I seriously can stress how much I hate and dislike Spirit Airlines. Everything about them is the worst, employees, sits and prices. I‚Äôm definitely never flying with these company. Save yourself a headache and just book another airline. I promise it would be worth it because Spirit airlines is straight the worst airline to ever existed. | I hear people moan and groan about Spirit all the time, however I‚Äôve been flying them for over a year, been on over 12 total flights, I use the app and have had to call customer support, and I am yet to have even the smallest of issues. I‚Äôve only dealt with the nicest of people, especially in the airports but on the phone as well. I have the credit card and the airline‚Äôs loyalty program, and so am lovin it all! | Went to New Orleans for getaway was concerned about carry on flight there was great checked bags at Nashville all good for carry on coming back had a 3hour wait leaving Florida finally get headed back to Nashville and they pull us both out for same baggage we used 3days earlier would not let us on plane without paying 100 cash so not cool don‚Äôt understand why it was ok going but not coming back | First experience with Spirit. Great price up front but then get nickel and dimed to death with final check in. | Just plan on it   And it will be a better ride | Customer service is a joke. | Boarding lady was Jerry rude and threatening about my puppy.  And puppy was no problem on plane.  Also rude to other customers | Compared to their competitors. Spirit app beats everyone else. | A la carte approach is not a traveler friendly option. That‚Äôs the first and last time I traveled with Spirit. After checking other airlines we‚Äôd pay much less for the same trip. Spirit is the airline to just rob you of your money any way they can. | Couldn‚Äôt check on or add bags for our flights, had to call customer service and took me hour and a half just to add bags!!! | Your app didn‚Äôt recognize that I paid I for a seat after I got a discouraging email regarding my bid. Now I get to wait until my credit card statement comes to determine how much you will actually end up billing me. There are also no clear instructions in the app or email as to how to cancel my bids. Bad system and bad app. | App will not let me purchase seat or wifi | At the beginning of my trip, I purchased a big front seat on the way out on a five hour trip and I purchased an aisle Exit row seat on the way back. When I went to check in to catch my flight back, they kicked me out of my, exit row seat and put me in a regular seat and then wanted me to pay 21 more dollars to get back into the exit seat I already purchased. They are crooks and they steal. Never fly with them. | Spirit has the best prices by far. I‚Äôve never had an issue flying Spirit it‚Äôs always been a pleasure. | 0 stars isn‚Äôt available. They charge fees for everything, seats, WiFi, board early, only allow 40lbs for luggage which is lower than other airlines, these are junk fees. Price gouging the way they raise prices during peak season. App is not clear if you already paid for bags very misleading and Bags are non refundable. Always a horrible experience and customer supervisors don‚Äôt return calls | Horrible customer service. No apple pay at check out. Money hungry airline. | the spirit app is low tech, clunky, has to be deleted and started up often.  is inaccurate and support is next to impossible | is the best airplane all history‚Äôs | Nothing ever works
I have to type in everything six times and it still displays errors 
Can not process 
Every page | Wifi does not work yet we paid for it. | This app is absolutely horrible. I don‚Äôt know any other app that tells you that your password is wrong, when it is the only password that you have been using. And the resetting of a password email takes so long to receive. Absolutely horrible service. But I guess you get what you pay for.",4.81153,1374804,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/4a/6a/aa/4a6aaae8-6fd6-0fa5-be70-082e64d36ff8/fa69651c-6efd-4f19-a7dc-fe48486a2a87_iOS_5.5_-_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/eb/a5/db/eba5db72-a25d-092a-c6f8-ba625581b3a6/f1f23663-4503-4e77-ac83-fe62bdda6984_iOS_5.5_-_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/3a/a7/92/3aa7927f-41a0-7a3d-2c74-33708e639110/5149fe9e-2279-4483-9ec4-43399ed269a7_iOS_5.5_-_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/b1/b2/bc/b1b2bc87-378a-66d6-44a4-893df26f5418/0453cb24-3a9c-4e43-b9a9-5432e9a8d163_iOS_5.5_-_4.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

It‚Äôs nice to have it in one place instead of counting down on a calendar or trying to do it in my head. | I like watching the day tik down for fun time | I think this puts the FUN in function!  I love to look and see how close we are to our big trip üíï | This app is fine, great countdown and all but I thought there would be a widget and was very disappointed when I couldn‚Äôt ad one. Also I couldn‚Äôt find anyway, to remind me like the day before or like the day that it happened but idk. I will change my rating to 5 stars if you just add the widgets! It would make it so much better. Well that is all‚Ä¶. | This is a great app. I can put different things in here that I‚Äôm looking forward to.

4) GO: OUR STEP-BY-STEP NAVIGATOR*

As the mercury meter hops around like a jack-in-the-box, we‚Äôre bringing you a weatherproofed wagon of minor improvements, including:

- Better bicycle trip plans. You‚Äôll now see a wider variety of options with fewer overlapping legs/zigzagging portions. We‚Äôll also favour trip legs with bike paths and lightly-trafficked roads even more than before
- Tweaks that make your GO live activities easier to peep at from the Dynamic Island
- Added bathtub plugs and caulking to leaky strings in the UI, everything is pixel perfect now

Anything else? Yes, but you‚Äôll have to wait until the next update!

Coming from the terminal in Ridgewood  to Downtown Brooklyn. It‚Äôs a 30 to 40 minute wait for this bus. The majority of the day. There needs to be more than one bus running. | Is there to help me know went the bus or train love it | This app never gives updated and correct departure and arrival times.  So terrible. | This app is flashy and fun to look at, but it‚Äôs way too busy. Also, it doesn‚Äôt update you as you‚Äôre walking, which makes it useless for me. Very nice developed that but in my opinion doesn‚Äôt work as well as simpler apps. | The app used to let you purchase bus passes on the app, but now it wont allow you to access them I paid for a month pass and the app won‚Äôt bring it up | I about the leave and the bus left earlier I missed school, this is so trash!! I swear if I get detention because of you I WILL SUE YOU!! | Real hassle to figure out destination and purchase a ticket | Maybe reduce the annual yearly price?? | The most convenient thing about this app was being able to see exactly where a bus is currently at. This would allow me to leave home at a good time and be at the bus stop seconds before the bus shows up. I wanna know where in the latest update it says they were taking this feature away. Now I‚Äôm left to wait for god knows how long just for a bus that may or may not arrive thus wasting my time and having to walk through complete ghetto at night. Deleting the app until the feature is back‚Ä¶ | Can‚Äôt turn off tracking 
Can‚Äôt see bus moving
Times is arrival differ | Changes in route or schedule that happen in the real world are slow to appear in the app. Perhaps local authorities are not posting in the app as quickly as they could, but then it‚Äôs a communication/outreach issue. | False information, incorrect time. This kind of app shouldn‚Äôt have been launched. The bus never comes on time to app | Disgusting app doesn‚Äôt work at all. Makes me late all the time don‚Äôt waste your time with it. | There‚Äôs no simple way to view all trolleys in area, you have to know exactly where you are and exactly where you want to go.  Good luck. | What is the point of this app if the busses don‚Äôt activate their GPS?  I‚Äôm currently standing here in the cold because the bus I take wasn‚Äôt showing up, so I thought I had time.  As a result, the bus passed me when I was 5 feet away from the stop.  I didn‚Äôt know it was my bus until it was too late. | Easy trip! Thanks | Can‚Äôt change route to front runner, only express. | I drove all the way to the bus stop I take usually at 11pm to get to school, where I park my car cuz they don‚Äôt let freshman park on campus and I wanna go back to my dorm for the week after a long shift at work. And I get there and it says there is no bus inbound until 6:30 am. Then as I‚Äôm pulling off to go back home thinking I just wasted my gas and time, the bus pulls up and picks up the people standing there waiting for the bus. So the app lies to you. I drove all that way thinking I was right and the bus would be there (which it was) but the app said nope not till 6 am (which was wrong) so I could have been on the bus back to campus but the app gave me misinformation and caused me to waste my gas and time. | yo creo que todos los pasajeros est√°n contentos con el viaje para el trabajo y la escuela üè´ | This app has become my go to when going anywhere in Chicago. It‚Äôs even more accurate than google maps and the UI is so helpful because its super easy to tell when to get off at a bus stop and how many stops are before yours. Thanks for this incredible app! | For months I couldn‚Äôt use this app reliably because voiceover would stop reading screens. now it works again. I am so happy. | Great application works better than maps on google. | 3/23/24‚Ä¶ About your bus stop/shelter questions:  Also ask is the ground within the shelter is clean.  You‚Äôre only asking about the bench. It‚Äôs not as if we can just float to sit on the bench. We have to walk on the ground within that shelter and that ground is oftentimes covered in trash, poop, urine, sticky unknown liquids. Companies responsible for cleaning the bus shelters often just power wash the glass walls, sometimes power wash the benches but very very rarely power wash/clean the ground within the shelter.    
==========[ORIGINAL REVIEW] As the title says, this app should show the bus/train number and not just the route number/name. You say you use data from the CTA. The CTS data includes the bus/train number so you should be able to include that info. The CTA‚Äôs own website - ctabustracker.com/map shows both the bus route number and bus number. | You lie about bus | Buses run late constantly and no shelters for bus stops | The app would be better if we were able to message complaints or compliments through the app about the bus driver. My friend and I were trying to catch the bus and it said it was on it way. As soon as the bus was coming the bus driver put in as not in services. When my friend tried to get on the bus the driver closed the door on him and yelled at him saying he couldn‚Äôt get on. We and other people waiting for the bus had to wait another 40mins. So in total we waited more then and 1hr and half for the next bus. | Please fix this issue.  I have been experiencing an issue with the Transit app on Apple Watch as it will not load the nearby lines.  There is a persistent ""Error loading nearby lines"" screen.  The issue immediately started when I updated my Apple Watch to WatchOS 10 back in November, and ever since that, the Transit app does not work. | This is a lot better than the way they did it before. | I only have 2 big issues with this app.
1: It‚Äôs not very intuitive for new users and doesn‚Äôt have an optional tutorial to help.
2: It eats battery faster than anything I‚Äôve ever seen before. My 45 minute trip will take my battery from 100% to 20% just using this app. No other app I have does that! | No es muy claro, es confuso | Very reliable and accurate for the most part | These people are really nice! This app helps me to get from school and back every day!! | Not only can you not find out about the arrival times of different forms of public transportation ONLY if you are a block away from them or if you pay the subscription but now the app won‚Äôt even tell you if a bus or train is coming, nothing will be on the map while your at the stop, you may decide to then pay for an Uber or Lyft or whatever and then as ur getting picked up, a train or bus shows up. Thank you transit app for being an absolute waste of a good concept. | Either you need more B24 or something but other than them not being on time everything else is ok. | New Orleans RTA & Jefferson Parish Transit needs your help supporting our transit systems to make our vehicles more efficient, accessible stops for buses, streetcars, and ferries. Also They need some major updates and more improvements | How cute that the iPhone 15 can get tracked with a gd satellite, but my bus app tells me 7:30, and WHILE IM WALKING TO MY STOP, it passes me at 7:20üëçüëç | It takes 10,000 fkin years for the loading wheel to stop spinning and actually give you train times. | I took the train for the first time in 4 years. I read the available maps but I felt that I wanted more information, the ticket buying process was a nightmare. Then I visited the state‚Äôs transit website and I was told to download this app. And chef‚Äôs kiss. This application is the best software I‚Äôve used in a while. And the feature of showing you what train you‚Äôre on and where you‚Äôre going is very simple yet it put my mind so at ease. This made the process of taking the train today thoughtless. Great job team! | I was walking to the bus stop with my brother and it said the bus was 5 blocks away but it passed us while we were walking to the bus stop. I have 5g with full bars and had to run the rest of the block only to not make it! Please fix this! ZERO STARS | Terrible app.  Where is the standard map, placed on a regular map that shows the lines and stops so you know what sites you can see from a particular stop.  I had to google trax to find it.  It is not on your site | Too many non-existing or late buses on this app make this app confusing and not very useful to plan my travel in Baltimore City | I just want to select an start location , an arrival destination and time and let me know when I need to start

Utrax was much easier to use

This app is not intuitive at at.  I wonder how older citizens can plan anything | Always glitching and hadn‚Äôt been accurate for months. | The times are off by 5-10 minutes don‚Äôt try to plan your day using this app you‚Äôll be early or miss your ride | Awesome | It‚Äôd be better if it looked more like google maps. The letters and pictures are too blocky. Put the bus stop number by the stops too. | The 100 route is awful the bus is always overcrowded and the wait time is 3 hours | The 23 bus is either always too early or always running late or just never comes and when it does come, it‚Äôs crowded in the drive right by us staying at one of bus stop. | Inaccurate arrival time of buses. Causes me and other people to be late. | i absolutely adore this app, ive traveled all over cslifornia with it, use it to go to work, school, snd so much more!! i live its user friendly interface, the bus and train times are extremely accurate, and its genuinely just a godsend, without it i wouldnt know where i was going LOL 

the subscription is sweet too!! shows more availiable lines and its pretty affordable in my opinion!! and even if you dont have that kindof money, you can request for a low income subscription! no gurantee that they accept you but its amazing to have for those who dont have that kindof money!!",4.64089,490891,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5d/14/3a/5d143a50-8897-a0fb-b8fe-5efe830d1eb2/48d0213a-99fe-49c8-8466-2b82927ccb71_US_EN-S1-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/5e/25/eb/5e25ebc2-164b-46a6-218c-d06f0028c1ee/3eae367a-fd22-4add-b93b-7a67b05a9d3a_US_EN-S2-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d2/cf/7e/d2cf7e4d-f556-6dd5-6ac9-10c50a11b738/f000fa45-af82-4bb0-ab6e-4b672deb8bbd_US_EN-S3-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/65/e8/e2/65e8e21e-748d-01e8-9b40-b31b8b1c5b24/6454f654-51f6-4df6-be85-5fed38590cb3_US_EN-S4-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/72/4c/58/724c581d-b972-1e00-ccb0-85aeee4636bf/251fd8e8-ad56-4ea4-a100-a48649551cd8_US_EN-S5-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a1/fb/ee/a1fbee13-f200-28a0-f622-051ca1bef41b/340da1d1-0bef-4d66-8e04-55c984d7d8ee_USA_EN-S6-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/27/c5/06/27c506ee-fc07-7120-e893-1de3587d7d53/8e83ce66-6e5e-45fc-b34c-200e92ec1353_USA_EN-S7-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8d/db/d4/8ddbd445-b263-9362-c127-324032d38421/2697c730-a556-46a1-b3e9-6e771a6c393a_US_EN-S8-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4f/a3/7b/4fa37b06-6bcb-8fb7-0fdf-8249a33731ca/9d114825-03d7-474b-a029-62d04dc07016_US_EN-S9-5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e7/a5/61/e7a561c4-7910-b84f-a270-62d91dd111ec/ec9b03f4-9cbf-4cce-978b-50cb825c5168_US_EN-S10-5.5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

So far better experience than previously encountered. | Went through the whole process of booking a flight for my toddler grandson, whose mother separately purchased her own ticket, only to receive a message that I have to use the main website, not the app to make such  a booking for a  child.  Alaska wasted my time. | You have always been great to me either booking or flying! Keep up the good work but watch those door plugs! | My husband and I flew our first time with Alaska and it was great!! We were so happy to have a nonstop flight from Nashville to Portland!! The crew was very friendly and helpful and everything went smoothly. Thank you for excellent service! 
Mark and Carolyn | The app makes it so easy and gives a traveler, peace of mind and keeping their trips organized. | Easy Peazy!!! | Today was the first flight (after several) when I could understand the attendants‚Äô complete announcements! I am a native English-speaker, but on my last few Alaska flights, the attendants‚Äô announcements were delivered so fast that some words weren‚Äôt clearly pronounced. Todays flight from Walla2 to Seattle was much different. I could understand every word that each attendant spoke, and I thanked each of them. The young man was not even a native English-speaker! Bravo to both of them! As a student of languages, I worry that passengers who aren‚Äôt native English speakers won‚Äôt be able to understand the announcements when they are spoken fast, (Esp when I myself had trouble understanding).That can be an added stress when traveling.  Thank you for all you do! | Love the flight attendants and service. | Alaska Airlines is a great airline! | The options and ability to pre order are great features. Thank you AK Air! | Alaska Air always out do themselves and is definitely my preferred airline carrier. | Check in was amazingly easy! | Had a smooth and simple online check in process | Yes | Very efficient and great service . | The check in process was seamless using the Alaska Airlines app. | It is so easy to use & helps make traveling so much easier. | Price could be better | Really annoys me that they make it impossible me to access your wallet funds on the app. You have to go to the website to look up your funds which so annoying. Definitely a dark pattern user experience and a business decision to stop people from using their funds. | Had to start all over again. | Personal & website services are exceptional. | I love this app very simple to use. | The app is intuitive, beyond easy and allowed me to share my itinerary with my family and business associates. | Easy to navigate!!! | Needs improvement on user interface and data input. It took me several attempts to pick the correct image for authentication. | Upon checking in when I got to the seat selection in it already showed me in the premium class and I could see it was plus $24 and did not want to change seats and pay additional. I then hit cancel that says you cannot check in so I hit next and it continued thinking it would not change my seats. When I finished, it showed me in the premium seats. I hope it didn‚Äôt charge my credit card as I would be very disappointed in the almost devious action. | After all these years :-( | Very awesome program. Makes setting up everything about your flight really easy.  Provides lots of peace of mind | Is this for real? You can do almost nothing in this app; resign yourself to the fact you will be on another device using a browser.

Oh for fun, after you get an account, they make you make another account with another user name if you also want a mileage account. What a mess. | Alaska has consistently had the best airline app‚Äî and one of the best apps period. It must have been designed for human beings. Unlike all too many apps, the user doesn‚Äôt have to figure out the ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù before they can actually use it. It‚Äôs a big advantage when trying to book, catch or meet a flight! | I can't find a way to sign into my account after signing out of my wife's, the app continues to default back to her account. | Every time I need to book a trip the app makes it so easy. | Took me a perchance click after 5 minutes to find the CheckIn. Please browse other flights apps and learn about smooth user experience. Have to scroll back to trips to find code for flight/booking, would it kill you to have options displayed on checkin page. | I‚Äôm a Alaska card holder and they charge for my luggage | Took Alaska once and cost me over 6 hours out of my day with 3 different technical issues | Had a great time! Thank the captain for the wings! Love them will keep them for ever | So Thanful! üßöüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏èüßöüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è | Seat selection was problematic trying to coordinate with other travelers | The app is often not up to date with your latest flight information. I find many of the design decisions counter-intuitive. It‚Äôs easy to not get a proper TSA pre boarding pass, if you forget to enter your middle name‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶for the 2,000th time‚Ä¶as it is not pre-populated from my account information. | When I bought our seats I picked a aisle and middle now that I checked in I am now they have put us in the middle and a window!  I never pick those because I have keens that lock up and sometimes I need to get up just to be able to move them!  This is the second time this has happened !  I paid and expect to get the seats I picked! | Apple pass shows the gate . Google shows the gate. The Alaska app doesn‚Äôt show the gate‚Ä¶
15 years ago my blackberry already showed the gate‚Ä¶ | Website for booking works well. | 80 f-ing dollars to check 2 bags is crazy! I was going to start flying with you more, but now I‚Äôm going to need to reassess that thought. | When checked in it did not apply my TSA pre check status. I had to go to the agents to apply it. | Easy check in thanks | My favorite airline company‚ÄîEVER! | Like nonstop flights to seat | Love the app",4.84943,934437,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/34/e5/50/34e5502f-7d86-d9fd-960e-1c2fd8ab6428/2772257a-c147-4d31-a1ed-5ef4e30898fa_1242_x_2208_-_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/0a/6b/eb/0a6beb7b-782d-2dae-6a04-e640d9e8c0f9/90dd33f5-9ced-4358-ae20-d16cabb66d52_1242_x_2208_-_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/33/5a/36/335a36c4-8a12-b4f0-557f-434bdd4a0870/fd5af66a-1914-4e87-9c0b-7c2a0f770c3a_iPhone_8_Plus_frame_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/37/5c/8e/375c8e1d-d81c-3d94-96cf-6110f3536100/77c79a3e-100a-4e8e-81cf-867775bc60be_iPhone_8_Plus_frame_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/fe/3f/3f/fe3f3f4b-187e-1ed0-95eb-dca530d875ab/c04f0d6f-361b-49bf-b582-409abd2c9616_iPhone_8_Plus_frame_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/e2/e9/62/e2e9625c-0143-60a1-dc03-2d7f1d7db0e8/2540ef38-91db-49af-877a-8271b7d5b899_iPhone_8_Plus_frame_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/77/2d/84/772d846e-d6e9-4980-15f2-2e3b2412cb85/cbd853fc-6747-4b8b-be49-45540b028b69_iPhone_8_Plus_frame_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/2f/bb/ef/2fbbef11-ab9f-bfb0-4c7f-995555fbb6c7/68e0025a-0917-4736-b09e-14a5f2981b5d_iPhone_8_Plus_frame_9.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Even major state parks are not in the database, and forget about National wildlife management areas. You also can‚Äôt just use a general location, like Santee, South Carolina - you have to know a specific address to do a lookup. I paid for an annual subscription - a complete waste of money. Since Apple Maps now allows downloading of offline maps, this app has become superfluous anyway. | Does not provide correct directions. When typing an address, the app does not recognize it from the few starting characters like in other navigation apps, you have to type complete address. | I just wanted to see the map. App tried to guess my location as Kansas (I‚Äôm in Oakland, CA) so I skipped the auto load. Then I tried to get a local map. My options were SF or CA, so I chose CA. Map download started slowly. After a few min, I estimated it would take about an hour to get the CA map, so I stopped and deleted the app. | I wasn't able to change the voice permanently to Ava from the default Samantha (Spoken Content nor Speech in iOS). It would revert back. The map danced like crazy when I was stationary. The sheer amount of options and the way to get to them was too convoluted for me. Why so many profiles?

Uselessly complicated non sensical menu system
Endlessly complicated poorly explained and setup options | 12/20/2023 I wish the app had turn by turn directions on iOS. I noticed it is available on Android. Other than that it is a great app. | So sad since I really love the concept. I‚Äôve personally mapped 2 new subdivisions to add to the maps. With this app the issues are with Car Play: 1) The map continually rotates in circles as you drive 2) The speed limit indicator showing up is sporadic 3) Voice turn by turn works so infrequently that it surprises you when you actually hear one 4) The visual turn by turn directions only somewhat work - the turn indicator is correct, but the distance till that turn frequently gets stuck and doesn‚Äôt update for miles. 5) Current speed indicator doesn‚Äôt work at all | Ÿäÿ≠ÿ™ÿßÿ¨ ÿ™ÿπÿØŸäŸÑ ŸÑÿ®ÿπÿ∂ ÿßŸÑÿÆŸäÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿ™ŸÉŸàŸÜ ÿßŸàÿ∂ÿ≠ ŸÅŸä ÿ≠ÿßŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ¥ÿ∫ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸà ÿßŸÑÿßÿ∫ŸÑÿßŸÇ ŸÑÿ®ÿπÿ∂ ÿßŸÑÿÆÿµÿßÿ¶ÿµ | Downloaded the app and plugged into car, map shows up blank but with a locator arrow visible. Couldn‚Äôt figure out why the map didn‚Äôt show up properly. Went into options, found and clicked ‚Äúenable CarPlay,‚Äù then see I the option is locked behind a purchase/subscription. Irritating that there is no way to try this feature without purchasing, and nothing that I saw upon opening the app that this wasn‚Äôt included.
I don‚Äôt mind paying subscriptions but it‚Äôs annoying when I can‚Äôt even try something out before buying it. | Thanks for you map , have you notes Persian voice is not working ? Pls fixed | No dark mode for menus, eats battery. This is 2023, most phones sold are OLED. Please update your software to modern standards. | You cannot update your free maps. Bugs bot fixed for years.  Directions and estimations are wrong. | I am using for bike touring. It crashes multiple day a day, even when it‚Äôs not navigating or calculating anything. 

It doesn‚Äôt link to OSM on the computer, which is disappointing. Just now it randomly drained 40% of my battery in 8 minutes while calculating a route that half an hour ago it had calculated just fine. This is the first time that has happened but it often takes longer than expected or desired to calculate a route.

It voice navigation is often timed a little wrong which has me take wrong turns. 

Like I‚Äôll keep using it bc Google maps doesn‚Äôt have the features I need but I am very frustrated by it. and I wish at bare minimum it wasn‚Äôt so buggy. | Not a fan of how these ‚Äúopen maps‚Äù apps are all paywalling unlimited map downloads and CarPlay. Like you‚Äôre already in the minority compared to google maps, why would I pay to use CarPlay? I‚Äôd be happy with a one time purchase, not falling for any subscription models. | Osm is constantly crashing after updated and I can‚Äôt use it anymore üòï | This app has a wealth of info and I love it for offline stuff. But having to use only metric really, REALLY drags my rating down. It‚Äôs simply stupid to exclude miles and feet. I want to love this app, but I can‚Äôt when there‚Äôs this big of an issue. Also it‚Äôs more difficult than it needs to be to navigate the UI just to *look at* simple stats and figures. | Just re-downloaded this. Just deleted it for the 3rd or 4th time. Last time
Tried it and deleted. Confusing unreadable and wrong too often. What‚Äôs wrong with these mapping apps? They are mostly useless. | What the actual f? It says my house can‚Äôt be found 
The location I want can‚Äôt be found 

Review are FAKE!!!!!!!!!!! | Really wanted to like this app because I hate Google tracking everything about us,,, but it just isn‚Äôt robust enough. Have used it a few months on a few trips. This last trip the app seemed to know the destination was approximately 260 miles away but when calculating a route the time and distance estimates were wildly inaccurate like by hundreds of miles and several hours. The route on the map seemed correct but while traveling beyond cell service in somewhat remote areas of MT, WY, and SD I wasn‚Äôt happy with ‚Äúguessing‚Äù. Don‚Äôt trust this app. And yes I spent hours tweaking it and attempting to understand how it works. The app is not mission critical and can‚Äôt be trusted. Best of luck for those that want to tinker with it. Just doesn‚Äôt make the cut for real world application. | :( | ÿÆÿ≥ÿßÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ®ŸÑÿ∫ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸä ÿØŸÅÿπÿ™Ÿá ŸÅŸäŸá | unable umport kml kmz waypoint | Let me clarify; this is one of the only GPS apps that lets you set a max speed limit. I tried to plot a route from NYC to LA with a max speed limit of 70mph - it crashed every time (even on an iPad Pro with 16GB of RAM). | Very good app. 
Many options, but no satellite imagery. Add that and I'd give five stars. üëç | Fantastic customer service which is always so important with any subscription‚Ä¶

Had a corruption issue where when reinstalling the app after iOS deleted it to save space the online tiles disappeared. Probably because the newer version it downloaded was used old saved data on my phone. Deleted everything and reinstalled and everything works perfectly. So happy to see this app receive continuous love and improvement. Thanks! | After downloading my state, it doesn‚Äôt even have my address, or my work address. Neither are in remote locations. Extremely hard to set a favorite. Overall very clunky and glitchy. Almost every feature I tried did not work. | This is an awesome app. Custom routes that are easy to create, cloud sync, carplay, and on and on. Could use some layout/UI improvements because it‚Äôs a bit confusing but the functionality more than makes up for it. | ŸÅÿßÿ¥ŸÑ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿàÿ¨ŸäŸá | In this case 4.99 is overpriced. You need super human eyes to read anything on this map. The contour lines are so faint you need to be in a closet to see them.

If you‚Äôre eyes don‚Äôt like straining from the screen then this product IS NOT FOR YOU.

Recently they are pushing a new subscription model, which I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not willing to pay any more and not willing to lose features when I currently can‚Äôt even download offline maps anymore which has left me in a jam‚Ä¶ this is a critical feature of this app, and tapping the ‚Äúmaps and resources‚Äù button just causes the app to completely freeze‚Ä¶

This app has always been a bit broken, but I‚Äôve been willing to support it because I care about open street map, and want to see it succeed‚Ä¶ however it is rapidly burning through any good will I had towards it and I will probably cancel my annual subscription to this app at this point. Others should probably follow suit. | They are now charging for functionality that previously worked without a subscription, like CarPlay. I previously bought map packs, etc. I wont be using this app any longer. Introducing new functionality is fine. Taking away features is not. | This was a great app but the new update has ruined it. Crashes regularly on Carplay. Is a danger and can no longer be used in the car. How can you release such a buggy version? Some of the many bugs: distance to next waypoint freezes, route line disappears, app quitting at random, route partially showing a straight line to target instead of street routing, etc. Was there no testing?
UPDATE: And, -without warning- it now requires a subscription to use it with Carplay! Buggy AND subscription? Looked around, found Sygic after testing many. Much better! Thank you OSMand for making me look for an alternative | Picked up this app since i've been mapping my town in OSM. This app is fast and is able to be a great offline map solution. However, I feel it is complementary to the existing online maps, and not exactly ready as a primary map app. Search is unable to locate a city/town, and mainly is based on searching for a POI. That said, 8$ a year for offline gps capable maps is cheaper than any alternative available, and is cheaper than an annual paper road map | Awesome map application | ÿ±ÿßÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßŸÖÿ∑ÿßÿ± ÿ´ÿßÿ®ÿ™ ŸÖŸÜ ÿßÿ≥ÿ®ŸàÿπŸäŸÜ ÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿµÿßÿØŸÇ ÿ®Ÿáÿß | As somebody who edits and uses, OsmAnd is irreplaceable and useful. The UI is kinda complicated, but the app comes packed with features and is pretty customizable. If anything the interface just takes some getting used to, but is decent to navigate once you‚Äôve used it for awhile. 

The vector maps are clean, and you can tweak the way they display a lot (hiding features like buildings is a nice touch). Map panning and zooming performance has improved on my device recently, and the issues I have with the app now are kinda nitpicks.

The biggest issue I have now is that road names are sometimes not displayed, especially for smaller side streets. This can make on foot navigation annoying at times. In addition, osmand on iOS tends to display municipal road numbers for state, county, nat‚Äôl highways, but not local road names as they are posted at intersections. Oftentimes highways are tagged with both the municipal number (ex. cr 18) and a local or alternative name in the OSM, and I‚Äôd love to see this reflected in osmand.

One other issue I‚Äôve had is with the street name indicator not displaying at the top of the screen, even though street name is enabled in the configure screen menu. An app restart usually causes this to display again. this does make it difficult to figure out what road you‚Äôre on from the app when this issue occurs.

Big props to the developers - this app is really useful and has helped me out a lot. A true competitor to google maps that keeps getting better over time, and is based on open data :) It‚Äôs always nice seeing the edits I‚Äôve made show up on osmand. 

Keep up the good work <3 | iOS is missing many features that the Android version has. Chief among them is being able to input GPS coordinates to provide accurate offline fixes of your position. Pretty disappointed to be honest. They really need to spend the time to update their iOS product so that it has the same functionality as the Android counterpart. | I delete the app from the iPhone and within 24 OsmAnd maps reinstalls by itself. How do I stop this? | Useful in so many ways and minus a few bugs I love it!

What‚Äôs up with limiting prices reports. | one of the few apps that is absolutely worth it. props to the developers for keeping ads low and functionality high. does EXACTLY what its supposed to. | If any app needs CarPlay support it‚Äôs this one. Why no support? | I‚Äôm a so so fan of this app. Especially when lazier people are using this app and the affected gas station. If no one reports the gasoline prices in a timely way, what good is it? Only positive is any special gas deals that particular station maybe having. | Been using GasBuddy for years, at least once or more per week. I try to report when I can, and it‚Äôs been extremely useful when traveling cross country. 
But please get with the future and make this app CarPlay compatible. It would be so much easier and convenient, allowing more people to use the app. | Use Waze instead.. | My typical gas stations are gone and it wants me to go into towns now. Why? I restarted my phone and the app, but it doesn‚Äôt help. | After the last couple of upgrades, the app no longer opens.  It opens for a second then crashes and closes. | Using the card I miss the savings bc I don‚Äôt activate the deal. OBVIOUSLY I want the deal if I‚Äôm using your card. So update the subscription to activate the deal for me when I use the card. 

It‚Äôs too much hassle to do all this activating and updating wrong prices so I can get the right savings. 

If I use the card and it says approved I should get the deal. I would have saved more using my loyalty with that gas station than your discount. | I appreciate this! | At no time did I receive any notification that the card expires. This cost me savings and embarrassment when the card was declined. I never spoke to a person and was only able to interact with a bot. What happened to human interaction. No offer of reconciliation at all for my trouble. Very disappointing. | The latest revision of the app added some features, but they are features without any obviously apparent benefit, with the downside of making the reporting of gas prices at least one step harder. This app is only as good as it‚Äôs users reporting prices. It just got less convenient to do so. | I‚Äôve been using this app for a couple years now and I see consistently that when I try to go find gas, the prices a list are never accurate and they‚Äôre always higher than what they report them to be. The straw that broke the camels back, however, was tonight when I tried to use the app at a gas station along the highway where I had to exit and go out of my way to get to the station,then only find out that not only would these ‚Äúpay with gas buddy‚Äù application did not work, but then I even tried the old school way of trying to use it by putting my card in and entering my pin number, I found out I could not do that either. According to what they‚Äôre telling me is that I have gone past my limit, even though it‚Äôs completely completely false. I have only used it once in the past two weeks and that was to put $40 of gas in the car nowhere near 400. | Propane would be a great addition to the fuels lineup!! | Can  only sort by distance while using current location but not when you put a city in. This doesn‚Äôt help at all when I need to see prices in the place I am traveling to. If you put a location in now it‚Äôs sorted by deal prices which are shown in order of price, annd includes all kinds of places not in order of distance of the town I put in. Waste of my time trying to find stations in the actual area I am traveling to. Put it back the way it was before last update. Very frustrating to have to sort through a list of places I won‚Äôt be going to. | There no customer service or toll-free number to call and you cancel the account and they still take money out of your account never used the card I am not very happy with these people. | It would be nice if they policed accounts that posted fake prices like owners to draw business.

Would be nice if they added non-ethanol and propane gas prices as well. For us campers and motorcycles.

Overall a great app and it works well. Never had any issues but like I said: room for improvement. | Unable to open the app. Please fix it for iPhone 6 | I have used your app for many years but am now quite frustrated. A station near me was closed for a few months for renovations but reopened 3 weeks ago, yet I still can‚Äôt find it in the ‚Äúfind gas‚Äùpart of the app. It is the Sheetz at 2300 Linglestown Rd and Colonial Rd in Harrisburg, PA. You are not doing your job if we can‚Äôt see all the available stations. I only knew it had reopened when I happened to drive by and now that is the only way I can check the price! | Gas 3.34 | Cant submit receipts when take photo

iPhone 15pro | I‚Äôve been using Gas buddy for about 8 to 10 years now. The most recent up date of the system has messed up. What was a great app. I can no longer search via map, different locations and their gas prices. Everything is pinpointed to my current location. The app does not show away to eliminate this restriction.I travel a lot and I like to see in advance what the prices of gas are now I have to enter a destination first and even then the app does not respond. | GB has ignored my multiple requests to fix the app. Piece of garbage run by people sitting on their hands with their thumbs shoved up into dark, wet, stinky places. A real trash bag of losers. Every day I lose leader points. I can be at a station reporting prices and the app says I‚Äôm too far away. Pho Q all !!! | When I started using the card, gas back was available on a Visa or MasterCard. Now you can‚Äôt even get into it to find out how to use it. | The app just changed on its own. I can no longer see prices in other areas. | Since updating your sponsor ads not loading | Looks like they are taking off some stations like Costco.   One star is too much for an app intentionally manipulating what you ca see | I had used another app, GPS something or other, which was really good and helped me find the cheapest gas both in my home area and when I was out on the road. But about two years ago they went out of business and their app no longer worked. So in searching for a new one, I found this one and I like it even better! I live in Southern California, so finding inexpensive gas is no easy feat. This app does it perfectly. üëçüèº | Had it got, rid of it. Too much work for $1.13 Twice I got gas and took a picture of my receipt, but had no place on the app to submit it so I had enough and just got rid of it. Two thumbs down from me. üëéüëé | I see gas prices, but some or anything something is not right with the app | I drove 5 miles for gas and it was 273 not 2.20. That‚Äôs this morning. 10 hours later you still have it 220. Why do you want to cheat people. Getting pretty old pretty fast in this country. 950 W Thornton Pkwy Thornton ,  CO. | I have been with Gas Buddy since before the Pandemic  !!
They are always improving the App and finding many ways to get cash back for your everyday purchases. You can sign up for free and start filling up your Piggy Bank Again!! | This app has literally the most ads I‚Äôve ever seen! Abominable!! | I‚Äôve been a loyal customer from day one, I even pay the extra do I can get money back from other multiple companies by using the gas buddy app. 
You‚Äôd be better off just using your local gas stations loyalty plans.  I have begged GasBuddy 11 times to sort out the Shopping app where you get 2% 4% 10% et cetera back they‚Äôve done nothing they‚Äôve ignored my emails. I am owed a considerable amount of money by GasBuddy and they will do nothing about it, but they‚Äôll take it their subscription every month.  I will be cancelling my subscription with them and joining my local gas station because it‚Äôs free. 

I‚Äôm not going to be treated this way anymore.  One very loyal customers is leaving. | As soon as they send you a gas buddy card, check and see how it‚Äôs charged.  For me, I couldn‚Äôt use debit all the time, so it charged me credit which is a higher price. That means on top of credit fees if you don‚Äôt pay your balance. Sure locating lower gas prices is ok but don‚Äôt use their card. | My iPhone6 stopped working when I updated the gas buddy app. Per the app the app should work on iOS 12.4 and later. My iOS is 12.5. 
Help! I love gas buddy! | Great app and concept, obviously wish the savings were a bit more and that it included ethanol free gas.  Please make an update that includes ethanol free gas! | Latest update won‚Äôt open on iPad with iOS 12.5.7. Always worked before. | Customer support will not help you do anything with this except close the ‚Äòduplicate‚Äô account for you. I didn‚Äôt even realize I had accidentally logged in with a ‚Äòhide my email‚Äô account and I‚Äôve been using it for quite a while, but they can‚Äôt do anything about it unfortunately. 

Good app other than that.. which is why still 2 stars | I never used to have an issue using GasBuddy. It was my favorite go-to. But lately, it‚Äôs useless. I can‚Äôt use it unless I‚Äôm hooked up to the internet which is moronic to expect while traveling. What happened GasBuddy?  This never used to happen. I‚Äôm about to delete the app. Get it together. 5G should be more than sufficient to get an app working. | 4 NSF charges Funds don‚Äôt come out until a later date Causing a debit time I can‚Äôt see & don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôll pay. On a fixed income , g b has caused grief and no number to call and talk to a human. Closing account. | This app has gotten so laggy it‚Äôs completely useless these days.  Used to be good. | App used to be better at reporting accurate prices, but now seems to be virtually useless in terms of pricing accuracy.  No longer can rely on it. | I like the idea of finding cheap gas prices but just a suggestion; add UNL 88 to the selection of fuel type as most hybrid vehicles run on this type of fuel. Also please add the Trip Calculator feature from the website to the app as that would save travelers time and more convenient to find gas stations along their trip(s). | But won‚Äôt continue to use it if I now have to sign in to activate a deal. It should be sufficient that I use your gas card. Sorry, people, you just lost a customer. | Inserts unlabelled or barely-labelled advertisements into gas prices list sorted by price, putting higher-priced gas stations higher of the list not because they are cheaper, but because they gave GasBuddy money. Update: when notifications are turned on, they also insert their own advertisements into the feed without your permission, and without a way to turn it off. | This used to be a great app.  I typically get better discounts from the vendors frequent discounts now.  Part of this is because some vendors have stopped using GasBuddy.  Part of it is GasBuddy doesn‚Äôt update stations that change in spite of multiple reports from me that the station is setup wrong.  An example of this is the station I‚Äôm standing at.  It has diesel.  It has had diesel since it opened but GasBuddy STILL DOES NOT show it. | HOW IS IT THAT IF YOU BEAT ALL CHALLENGES EVERY DAY, EVERY TIME, YOU WILL NEVER, EVER BEAT THE NUMBER ONE SPOT, AND YOU WILL NEVER BEAT CERTAIN PEOPLE ON THE LEADERBOARDS!!! THIS WHOLE APP IS FIXED AND YOU WILL NEVER ADVANCE!!! THIS APP IS RIGGED!!! CERTAIN PEOPLE WILL BE ON TOP OF THE LEADERBOARDS FOREVER!!! THERE SHOULD BE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHERE THE AVERAGE PERSON CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO ADVANCE TO 1st PLACE!!! NOBODY SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMAIN IN 1ST PLACE FOREVER!!! I COMPLETE ALL OF THE CHALLENGES AND NEVER ADVANCE TO THE TOP SPOTS BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE AT THE TOP SPOTS ARE ALWAYS THERE NO MATTER IF THEY PLAY OR NOT!!! IT IS TOTALLY UNFAIR!!! I REALLY HATE THIS APP AND I WILL BE TELLING MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ON SOCIAL MEDIA NOT TO USE THIS APP AT ALL!!! IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE FACT THAT I HAD TO GIVE ONE STAR, I WOULD NOT GIVE ANY STARS AT ALL!!! I WILL BE USING ANOTHER APP FROM NOW ON!!!! THANK YOU GASBUDDY FOR ALL THE NEGATIVE MEMORIES!!!!!!

Especially for an app that‚Äôs supposed to be used at quick intervals, this really bothers me for some reason. 

Oversimplifying it I‚Äôm sure, but in React Native, add this to the info.plist and it should unlock refresh rates above 60Hz. GasBuddy seems pretty well optimized‚ÄîI'd be surprised if there were issues.

However i paid for premium thinking my friend and i could both keep track together. Instead the ‚Äúcomparison‚Äù feature is a one-time comparison that you have to do ad hoc. Please integrate the ability to add friends and continuously keep track of friends‚Äô progress | I saw this was used by a travel blogger so thought I‚Äôd give it a try. Premium Access was offered for $2.99 so made the purchase. Opened the downloaded app to the Been tab typed in several cities I have been to, then several countries Ive traveled to. Each time I tap on search nothing happens. The screen simply says I have no saved countries.  I Went to see if there was a video available with instructions. There is one but its in German. I just wasted $2.99 and most importantly 30 minutes of time. By the way Mexico is not in North America. | Why is the map so big now it used to be right size now it shows Greenland üá¨üá± being giant | I‚Äôve use this app for years & love the new features. I would LOVE if you could track National Parks as well! Just traveled to two in Croatia and would love a way to track them. | Been has gotten way better in recent updates. I love it and with the upgrades bought the upgrade. One ask is to show a view of my airport locations on a map, and at some point my cities. | I love the Been app. It‚Äôs perfect for me. But I‚Äôm dying for a macOS version. How about it? | I love the Been app, and the overhaul update makes the app so, so much better.

A few suggestions:
- Add currencies
- Make it a bit easier to edit visits

Love the app! | I used to like this app about a year ago. It was super simple and I can easily see what percentage of the US or the world I‚Äôve been to. Now it‚Äôs so hard to do anything. Features were added that were pointless and get in the way of the concept the app used to be. Deleted. | I really enjoy traveling and tracking where I‚Äôve been so really like this app. But I would like to go back and add info about timing of my past trips and can‚Äôt find a way to do that.

Also, for Oceania, it correctly shows that I‚Äôve been to Australia and French Polynesia and on the bottom it lists 2 countries, but in the summary it just shows one. Also it just has a short list of cities and no way to add the various islands we visited.

I‚Äôd there is a way to fix both, please let me know. | I think an option to keep track of all the counties you‚Äôve visited would be a great option, on the national and individual state level. | Love that this was updated with many features.  But UI isn‚Äôt good at all.  So challenging to use.  I can‚Äôt find where to see a photo of all the US states Ive been to.  Where did that go?  Please simplify the interface. | This app used to be so simple and so easy to use. There was a recent update that totally ruined the experience. I‚Äôd recommend trying out another app because Been is now too difficult to navigate. | This app used to be so amazing until they updated it :/ | Terrible, not intuitive | Was a good, simple app before the update. Now it‚Äôs got a horrendous UX/UI. Not intuitive and also classified countries incorrectly? Just weird. Unusable now. | I love this app so much, but lately I opened the app i saw a premium version that i can add cities where i have been.
I push button 'unlock premium' many times and nothing happen. Please fix it. Thank you | I used to love the app to update the states I‚Äôve been to. I just opened the app to add Idaho and it took me a few minutes to find where to add it. I‚Äôm really disappointed because I liked the Simple App. | I‚Äôve been using this app for years. It WAS great. Simple, intuitive. Now they‚Äôve over complicated it with all the added junk. | Where is Antarctica? | Really disappointed. Used this app religiously when traveling the past 4yrs and this last update put basic functionality behind a paywall. Look else where. | The new update with the paid version is a huge improvement. I highly recommend getting it for anyone interested in more detail to their tracking of countries, airports, cities, and so on and so forth. | Checking in on the app mar 2023 and all my data seems to be gone. The many places I entered months ago now gone. I‚Äôve got no confidence that entering it all in again won‚Äôt again cause it to be flushed. When there was data it was not properly categorized. I‚Äôd had entered many cities I‚Äôd lived in and visited. But the ‚Äúmy regions‚Äù report shows 0 entries? That is a problem. If one have to enter all of the data many times once for city, then again the region eg state explicitly ? And I‚Äôll agree the classification is wrong. For example there is no way the various subdivisions of say American Samoa are the same as a single US state. Samoa as a whole would be on the same political subdivision as a US State. All of the US Virgin Islands would be at the same level as a US state. Individual districts or islands may be on the level of US counties within the states. This indeed makes the statistics mostly misleading and meaningless other than in the context of the app - ie pointless. Finally , why are all cities that exist in a map not storable as a visit in the app? Eg Chugwater Wyoming USA. Is are the cities actually manually curated in a table in the app? Not just loaded from a UN data file?

And finally the visualization , while I had it. Unless I‚Äôm missing something ,  viewing countries as all or nothing is not helpful. So if one location in the USA was visited the entire USA is colored in on the map?   The globe/map visualization should have a ‚Äúdetail‚Äù level one can turn on to specify which view of data to visualize. Eg Country Level (what we now get) , next lower (state / territory/region) , and maybe next lower (county, district , prefectures etc). 
This way someone looking to visit all of one country can get more meaningful visualization. | Why did you remove Antarctica from the map? I enjoyed seeing it when I looked at the map of countries I‚Äôve been to :(. Otherwise I love the app, been using it for years. 5 stars except you took Antarctica off the map :( | The old version was so clean and simple now it isn‚Äôt user friendly | Love the new look and functionality of the app. Really embraces the travel log elements in a way that Foursquare once did many years ago. My one note would be to see if the Timeline view can be extended to states/territories as well. For people traveling more domestically (in whatever country that may be), it‚Äôs a helpful view that tells a cool story for you and/or friends. | I don‚Äôt know why people have bad reviews about this app!  I think it‚Äôs amazing! | The first airport I tried to load required premium upgrade. | Great update | I loveee this app. But I‚Äôm wondering if there can be some connection between Apple devices? I have to update the same info from my phone to my iPad every time and I think seamless syncing through maybe your iCloud account would go so far!  Love it though. Especially the new update. Even paid for the upgrade and I check it out all the time. I‚Äôm a perpetual backpacker so this is super helpful! | love the app but its not syncing across devices through icloud. also would be even better with mac/watch support and face/touch id | Flag mode should include the option to incluse places such as Taiwan and Kosovo. otherwise it‚Äôs great. | I used to love the simplicity of this app. Now after the update there‚Äôs too much going on and took away the good stuff. | I used this app for all my travels across the world. Then they changed the app and added so many features. Complicates it all. 

They added all the provinces to my 50 states checklist, making it nearly half what states I‚Äôve been to, if this was to be fixed, I will change my update to 5 stars bc it was a great app. | I‚Äôve used this app for years to keep track of the countries I‚Äôve been to, and it‚Äôs always simply done the job. I just noticed the most recent update, and it seems SO cool. It adds the ability to check off territories, cities, and even airports. Love it.

work!",3.65111,450,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/7b/1e/33/7b1e3342-f9f2-fc8d-3048-ce80e6a1ba9e/1cd15480-7996-4557-87c8-956c4e80e300_5_5_Select_Tab.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/5d/a9/c6/5da9c600-6d7a-771a-7132-34d36773e632/2a2ffa63-7a97-447b-9a7f-f74c9f95ad2b_5_5_Compare.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/b2/52/6f/b2526f69-7d4d-3425-1152-0419ef3e7e06/bdbf4084-bc1b-41a6-ad72-ce7be408fda9_5_5_Globe.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/79/5c/26/795c26db-f757-0fa3-3b7c-37fb56d929f6/9814ec49-2164-47cb-ae43-1960a7509f06_5_5_Widgets.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/01/97/e3/0197e38c-d6a1-bcbb-ee56-965bb0925289/11c78bdd-8ab6-41d5-b6c2-769bd42b69e0_5_5_Regions_in_USA.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/64/bd/01/64bd014a-31c4-e2ec-0618-2f5045512616/7d5b19f3-d9bb-4bdc-a0ef-56fe61e9e151_5_5_Timeline.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/12/d1/31/12d131b9-71c5-17c6-7910-f359624819d3/063efa42-833d-40d9-98fd-a7bbe135c4f2_5_5_Country_Details.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/4c/99/db/4c99db99-8a27-a421-d5c2-8d7e83390f39/ae624222-b7c2-4829-8fb5-a8379a772e4d_5_5_Explore.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/06/1e/7d/061e7d0e-630d-594a-3933-4c0b6fafc6e5/9c9ba3c7-564a-4422-b340-4cc6410854a5_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/cc/7d/cd/cc7dcdae-ca64-4307-6991-588649daf4fa/56a53cd2-8adb-45e1-a3f6-bf662a2b7110_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/09/e0/ee/09e0ee39-68b6-7696-f32f-9a311d2ba139/7789fd36-a2a7-419d-8141-501675413f7d_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/ea/3d/b8/ea3db8b5-27be-5114-b231-a71836baa359/5885fa25-966e-4245-b8b0-4b6f8394835b_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/8f/68/48/8f6848a2-2207-658f-cc69-6b75c85a30ab/38c78599-e624-4b2a-8026-bc26a07a9a55_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/ce/b5/44/ceb54481-43b7-ff26-970c-39e2d0fb71ea/be1c2a96-6289-44af-a1f6-9d5f9970b61f_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/83/b3/c0/83b3c047-ec90-9e0b-a443-e09cf96ad818/43ed53d4-bdc8-4ae5-93c6-e6c5194a349d_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/e3/ee/9e/e3ee9e6a-5116-894f-14ec-6dec602ab0d6/a8a9f177-bad6-4ac7-a32b-7def8b6d4f83_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCell

The app requires passwords to be in NUMBERS ONLY and requires EXACTLY 6 CHARACTERS. Nothing more complex (alphanumeric, special characters, longer passwords) is allowed.

Of course, they don‚Äôt tell you this when you are signing up: you have to keep creating new passwords which are rejected bu their system, until you see the error messages pop up that explain what kind of password is actually acceptable to create an account.

Who does that in this day and age of technology?

This is a big airline and should invest in technology. For this reason,I will not purchase a ticket with Turkish Airlines. I will take my business elsewhere. | Awesome | This app is very difficult to use compared to other airline apps. I travel frequently with many airlines and always use their apps. This is one of the hardest ones to use. There seems to be a lot of bugs with it as well. For example, the app told me my seat selection was complete, but never actually saved it. I even checked on it the day of my flight and it still showed my seats as confirmed. But when I got to the airport, they said the seats were never confirmed and I didn‚Äôt get my seats. There seem to be similar glitches of entering information and the app asking you to enter the same information again and again. It would suit them well to look at other airline apps and find ways to streamline this one. | Having a horrible experience.

This is my first time in Turkey and I want to apply for a promotion-discount 20 or 25% but your system did not allow, I tried several times and Form Feed Back was always the wrong thing and making me delay for booking.
Please permit a make good for the future, since this is my first time visiting your country.

Too many bugs, never allows me to check in using the app. | I had the WORST experience with paying for my reservation, I spent hours and hours and didn‚Äôt sleep all night because I was talking to customer service and they all kept giving me the same instructions that they‚Äôre not able to process the payment and I have to go to a sales office. With NO sleep I went to the nearest airport because that was the only one I could find near me‚Ä¶ and no one was in the office!!! Now they‚Äôve cancelled my booking and I have to pay an extra $100 because of THEIR mistake. | Amazing Airline, amazing app! | Been flying on Turkish Airlines for the past 10 years.
Before that i used to fly on Lufthansa & Austrian Airlines.
Turkish airlines is way above them with service, more frequent flights & the best connection award winning Istanbul International airport.
My favorite airlines is Turkish.. | When buying add ons you are unable to stack multiple items for one payment. Everything has to be paid individually. Such a hassle. | My miles from previous round trip were deleted and had to update app in order to purchase new ticket and all miles gone and had to enter half of my info again.
Not happy | The flight number is missing on the trip info page | The app doesn‚Äôt show award availability as shown on website.  And neither the website or the app match what agents can see.  Unfortunately you MUST call to make award reservation if you are not one of the passengers.  And they consistently cannot see flights that could be booked on the website.  
Oh, I confirmed availability by phone before transferring points.  Then magically agents can‚Äôt find seats (that the website and partner airlines show as available ) | When they changed my flight the seat reservation disappeared. Spent 45 minutes on phone with someone who said their system wouldn‚Äôt allow her to transfer the seats. Had to pay fees all over again. Very frustrating. | Soft application need to add more currencies such as USD and Euro‚Ä¶ | ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ | Best company | How does this app get a 4-star review? It has a lot of bad reviews and is not user-friendly. Still choosing to fly Turkish airline and much worse happens.. They lost my baggage and had no help from them. Not update me on the whereabouts of my baggage even though I gave them my number to contact me when they said they would deliver my baggage the next day. Now it's 7 days and I am stranded because of this. I missed my business meetings in others States because I'm stuck waiting for it. | I‚Äôve been trying to use this app to book a flight for a couple hours now and it just doesn‚Äôt work. I am using an iPad Pro. Every time I try to input my name, etc., it refuses to accept and keeps giving me an error message. What a total piece of crap app and such a frustrating experience | App has settle bugs that make certain features impossible to use. One example is that when trying to fill out sign up form for Miles&Smiles the password field only allows entering digits on mobile keyboard and does not allow paste thus making it impossible to sign up. | App does not load up at all. All I get is the ‚ÄúBest Airline in Europe‚Äù window and then the app crashes. So much for that assertion. | Unable to complete check in process. Apps keeps saying session expired and redirects to home page | After wasting your time checking in online in the end, it tells you your time is expired. Even if you do it again within two minutes it will tell you your time is expired.

üôèüèªüíï‚ú® | Love this app! Gets me to my destination perfectly! | If I could get 0 stars I would because I can‚Äôt even get an account set up. I was really looking forward to a good GPS for hauling my travel trailer. Initially saw a high review rating but when looking through the reviews it appears that many others are having some serious issues. Don‚Äôt waste your time! | Took me 5-10 minutes to enter 2 locations for trip. Computer would reroute you to the app. App would reroute you to safari and safari and would reroute you to the app‚Ä¶? | Navigating app was a bit challenging.  And then asked to sign in every 30 seconds.  Nagging login, basic UI, and other‚Äôs comments on navigation, just going to uninstall and an alternative | Just updated a few days ago, and now whenever you enter a town to search near the map scales out to the entire world/max zoom out and is located over S Africa I think. Huge annoyance to have to scroll/zoom back in to the US every time. Please fix. | Before using this GPS we ended up on some google traps that nearly did us in. This GPS routes me perfectly. | This app is great for planning trips and learning more about the RV Life. With steady updates, this is my go to for trip planning. | I have been using this app for just over a year and I really do like the planner/wizard. Easy to find places you are looking for, good at alerting where gas stops are required. Even the ‚Äúhow far I will drive in a day‚Äù areas are super helpful. But then there is the navigation when on a trip. Yes, it will give you a safe route. Yes, in general it will get you where you are going. This past trip, southbound on I-95, we got the ‚Äúuse the left lane to stay left‚Ä¶take exit on right in 550 ft‚Äù. That exit on the right was 4 lanes over, not possible. It‚Äôs one example but stuff like this happens all the time while using it. 

I still use it to plan but I manually add stops into google maps to track the same route. I hope the navigation gets better over time! | $65, really? | I just updated the RV Life app on my iPhone. When loading my trip it says my first leg from Ohio to Iowa is over 24,000 miles. They broke the app. | Your app does not show the whole trip. Your website when it lets me sign in works great. | My family has been in a crunch time trying to find an RV park that will accommodate our needs. Although we haven‚Äôt found anything yet due to the parks being at full capacity, this app has been extremely helpful filtering out what we don‚Äôt need and the map gives a clear view of what‚Äôs around locally. | I have been using this app for a year and CarPlay is dated need more improvements. | GPS is un-useable. Too bad as everything else is great. I‚Äôll be back when they fix it | I don‚Äôt see a Help menu on this app. I use this app on an iPad and iPhone. I just entered five stops for a trip and I couldn‚Äôt find a Save button. When I opened Trips again only one stop was saved. I do not find this app User Friendly | Navigating this app with changing screens and prompts that make no sense.  I have uninstalled it. Good riddance. | first time using it going to FL and back home. It brought us all over the place and on a road that WAS NOT RV safe when the path states RV safe. We had no choice due to on a one way road and we ripped off part of our AC unit on our roof. I do not recommend this app. | Has anyone had to utilize RV for life, if so what has been your experience?

Thanks 

Theresa | Love app for camp ground research and trip planning.  However, the gps has been hit or miss for me. Very often I‚Äôm taken down very out of the way routes through small towns with some really tight turns and then I find a route that stays on main roads almost right to my destination. So be sure to sanity check your routes or be ready for the potential to learn some new towing skills. | There isn‚Äôt a way to create a new trip in trip wizard.  Somehow I created one a few months  ago, but now there is no option to do so.  Totally useless. | I have found this app to be easy to use & find many options for places to stay. Thank you to developers & all the places to review. | The GPS has taken me several times and areas of construction that really are just dangerous for trailers. If you look around there are alternate bypass routes for vehicles over 10 feet I know the trailers aren‚Äôt over 10 feet but when you start getting into these construction zones with real tight spaces it gets dangerous. | Carplay need some work. NO lane guidance and the map can not be changed from top view to 3d view what makes it very difficult to see when you are approching an exit to identify in which lane you need to be depending on which side you are turning after taking the exit.  I emailed the company about this months ago and they responded that they know about it and they are working on it and here I am still waiting for that update and I am a PRO account. | We‚Äôre moving cross- country and are relying on the app daily to help locate good RV parks, plan trip routes, calculate mileage. It‚Äôs indispensable! | I bought the RV Life subscription to get rv safe mapping and can use the maps and other features. But when I hit Trip Wizard and try to use that, it sends me to the page to purchase a subscription. Is this right? | The app is good but not great. Many times it told me to make a uturn on 2 lane highway, that doesn‚Äôt work well with a 38 ft coach. Also there is no traffic avoidance like waze has. | The concept is amazing but the UI is too complicated and frustrating.  Needs a redesign from the user perspective of simpler is better. | The application promised to show gas stations that are suitable for RV in the paid version. In fact, the application shows all the gas stations, even the small ones, that you can't go to the RV. | When leaving Missoula this app routed us right into a extremely dangerous and costly situation.  Routed us directly through a 13‚Äô overpass as ‚Äúsafe route‚Äù.  It was not as our 5th wheel is 13‚Äô 4‚Äù.   I screamed and we hit the brakes!  We had to back up traffic to escape.  Needless to say we were shook.  
I placed several calls and sent emails to let them know, they never commented or replied. 
Horrible and dangerous! | Planning a route from Pennsylvania to Ohio.
Using the RV trip planner GOS wants to route me up across Interstate 80 or down across Route 68 with both routes taking well over 8 hours. ( I did not have TOLL ROADS turned off) Would not even let me select the Turnpike.
So, Planned the route on my Garmin 890 and it took me across the PA turnpike which is 6 hours.

Sooo, FORGET RV TRIP WIZARD. USED the GARMIN! | I wish the GPS would stop sending us into stressful and sometimes even dangerous situations. No, I will not make a U-turn with my trailer, and I would also prefer not to go down narrow residential streets. It would be great if these options could be turned off. Other than that, useful app. | Not a bad AP for RV routing but the GPS needs to be updated with more features such as a choice of vocals for directions as the robot voice gets a bit old. Live traffic data, more than one map version, points of interest, etc‚Ä¶.
Sometimes data is missing on the map even when I have downloaded the state I am in. It can be a little finicky and not a fluid experience with delays when you start rolling it takes a while to catch up. Sometimes it states that the route is not RV safe and needs to be verified, well is that not why I purchased the AP? How do I verify if it‚Äôs RV safe? With a better AP? | Been full time for a year now.  Hit 39 states and used the planner for all of it.  That part of the app is fantastic.  It‚Äôs the gps that needs a lot of work.  Doesn‚Äôt tell you what road you are on, doesn‚Äôt show how far to the next maneuver or what the next maneuver is or how far to the final destination.  Gps is garbage!!!! | This is one of the worst apps I have truly ever used in 25 years as a traveler and software engineer. It bounces you between the web and the app and often freezes in the process. The password management is atrocious. When they can‚Äôt manage correct credentials- they simply lock you out and tell you to setup another one. The mobile app (which I am trying to use as a Pro member) is worthless. I am using Google Maps because the RVLife interface is cluttered with useless features that simply get in the way. Don‚Äôt even get me started on how difficult it is to set up a trip! 

These people advertise aggressively and everywhere and I fell for it. Just simply a frustrating, buggy timesink of an app with slick marketing. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to my worst enemy. (Actually- I would. It would be amazing revenge of a sort.) | Started the free trial and on the very first trip, this app took us down a dead end gravel road so bad we suffered damage to our fifth wheel that will probably cost me around  $1,000 to repair. Not only have I cancelled the app, I‚Äôd really appreciate some support from this company on covering the repairs. | Save your money and only use the free features. The GPS is terrible. Google Maps is way better. | Updated app while on way home during trip. It changed next route and added almost 200 mi to next destination but cant figure out why. Customer service was not of any assistance. They did mention that some people were experiencing difficulties after the update but did not offer any compensation for the extra costs we incurred on our cross country trip. 
We also had prior issues where the gps did not route us on safe roads. 
Unfortunately we have loss faith in this app, their customer service and their developers. 
Because of this and their no seeming to care attitude we will be reviewing other apps and programs and not renewing this subscription. | The app is great for planning but not very good when driving. Not enough advance warning before turns or changes of roads. | This app is a great resource for traveling and finding campgrounds! | This app is impossible  support stinks. | After four years of safe RV travel to 47 of the lower 48 states and 5 Canadian Provences using Google Maps we finally had a problem with ‚ÄòLow Clearance‚Äô.  In navigating the New England States we found ourselves traveling south on I-95 from CT to New Jersey. I picked the fastest route that Google suggested and found ourselves on the Hutchison Parkway in New Rochelle, NY with a 10‚Äô6‚Äù trailer and one 9‚Äô6‚Äù underpass after another. 30 minutes later we joined the big truck parade through NYC. Which leaves to Part 2 of this tale.

I checked around at various truck/rv routing apps and decided that the GPS function in RV Life was easy  to use and already on my phone, and better yet worked with CarPlay. Just to try it out I searched for ‚ÄòWhole Foods Market on N.Pottstown Rd‚Äô. The search provided an option which we followed down a variety of narrow, but ‚ÄúRV Safe‚Äù roads to an empty field. Lesson learned. Unlike Google Maps this GPS doesn‚Äôt have any idea about things like grocery stores. It had taken us to ‚ÄòN.Pottstown Rd.‚Äù But nowhere near the WF‚Äôs. I suppose of I had used a street address I may of had better results. | This app worked great for our trip through Nevada, Utah, and Idaho.  But it really wanted to send us on 5 right through Los Angeles traffic on the way to Disneyland instead of 210 to 57.  Very frustrating that we had no way to select that as an alternate route!  Another trip to Casini Ranch on the Russian River it totally sent us a very sketchy way and luckily we made it in 1 piece without slamming into trees or the rock wall.  Some lady was walking her dog on that road and we almost took both of them out.  Scary!  We don‚Äôt trust this app anymore at all. | Have used this for 2.5 years. It has taken me on roads I should not be on. I now compare their gps to google maps. Bad bad bad gps for pulling a camper.  Otherwise, this app is great for finding campsites. | Directions would take me off the interstate just to go back up the same ramp..  when on the interstate it would not say or show if you needed to go N-E-N-S when you are merging onto another interstate. Ended up going back to google maps‚Ä¶ | Overall concept is great.  But trying to schedule a trip planning event is not as easy as it should be. Your would think Starting at point A to go to point B should be easy. Get the start A but point B is not shown to enter. Tried multiple times different ways on different trips but still same results. Must be missing something but tired of trying. Plus required to pay whole year, even if cancellation you are not prorated and must wait until year is up. Big disappointment. Seems that there is a program problem for entry. | I don‚Äôt see how the navigation is much different from Google maps. With Google Maps you can avoid tolls and highways. It seems like the only other benefit to this app is that you can avoid tunnels, if that‚Äôs even accurate. I would‚Äôve thought that there would‚Äôve been a way for you to find gas stations that are friendly for trucks with travel trailers or large motorhomes. You could go to a truckstop, but I‚Äôve been to truck stops that have spaces for trucks but then the fuel is diesel only. I don‚Äôt see much advantage in the reviews because they don‚Äôt get very detailed. And you can find many more reviews of whatever campsite you‚Äôre looking into on Google maps then you can on this app. If the app was free, then I say it was great. But if you want me to spend $65 a year you need to offer much more than Google Maps does. And this app does not. | The speed limit displayed on the GPS screen is often wrong! Driving in a posted 45 zone the app showed 65 as the speed limit! 
Instead of having me continue straight across  a highway, the instructions said to turn right then make a u-turn, then turn right and get back on the road I was on! 

This update needs work! | I have read other reviews about Mac troubles. I too am using OS 12 on my iPad, latest OS on my phone, and occasionally on a Mac laptop. I would like to make my iPad primary but I am having trouble loading an earlier version - that‚Äôs not RV Life‚Äôs problem. I love the ability to search campgrounds as we go, on the map feature. I started using this because it is where RV Campground reviews moved. Good app, it is my go to when traveling. | We use RV Life to plan our trips and appreciate all of its features.  If you have an iPhone and your Rig has CarPlay,  RV Life works perfectly !!!  I have one suggestion, if RV Life could add a RV fuel pump option.  I noticed that some fuel stations have stand alone pumps just for RVs or small trucks.  Maverick Gas in Durango Co is a great example.   Hope you can add this feature some day!

Google Maps has better navigation info | I just downloaded the app on iPhone 14-  I signed up and registered and also verified my email info and clicked yes for location access on my phone-  then I got a blank screen- I tried turning my phone off- the app just gives me a blank screen when I open it on my iPhone-  frustrating- made me feel like this was a potential scam to give access to my phone | Anything worth using cost money. Might as well use Google Maps for free. | This could have been a good app if it focused on its rail timetable and planning strengths.  Instead, it is cluttered with distracting and irrelevant offers and information for things one can search and find in a dozen other better content sites.  This obscures and undermines the rail planning function which could have made the app uniquely worthwhile.  It is not a question of paying for ad-free premium, it‚Äôs a question of app focus to do one thing well instead of ten things poorly. | I can get it to login perfectly on an iPad, but it keeps saying that the password or email is incorrect when I try to login via my phone. | Despite having an expensive subscription service, it is LOADED with ads. The home page of the app is a landing page for advertisements. It will constantly send you push notification ads. The directions are marginally better than Google/Apple maps, it‚Äôs 100% not worth it. | We had our own passes purchased direct from JR Rail so it was not very useful. Seemed ‚Äúmarketing heavy‚Äù to encourage purchases for other tours. | Does not show route maps! Even for paid version. Don't waste your money. Travel instructions lack clarity. One good feature: it *will* tell you when to leave Point A to arrive at Point B, at a specific time. Other than that, Google maps is far easier to use, plan, & view your route while you're traveling. | We had some events pre planned and I can‚Äôt add them. They only show you booking through them. I can find the routes etc, but definitely not worth the money if you just need help with some stops. | Great app when it was free | Latency is bad. Itinerary function is confusing and useless. | This app is great, but‚Ä¶..  it always deletes my saved train routes. I live and work in japan, and it‚Äôs very annoying when I look to see what train I can take, and it deletes ALL my saved routes. To the point I have to save them all over again. This has happened multiple times. | I‚Äôve never been to Japan before, don‚Äôt speak Japanese. Planned my whole trip using this, paid for premium, it‚Äôs worth it!! Would not have been able to get around the subways without it. | Haven‚Äôt been able to get it to work from day one!  Deleted it and found something else. | I‚Äôm trying to use the Osaka subway route map and it ‚Äúcan‚Äôt find‚Äù any station I‚Äôm trying to search for.  Useless! | ‰π±Êâ£Ë¥π | I used to love this app, but they‚Äôve made some very questionable changes lately. Seeing the station list used to be free, now they‚Äôre making you pay for premium to look at it. I‚Äôve also seen a bunch more popups bothering me to upgrade. I‚Äôll be using a different app from now on. | We traveled most of Japan and found google to be better. Navigation seemed hard and it didn‚Äôt seem to come up with interesting things to do. 
I struggled to find the right trains to get on and just gave up as it was easier in google. I found the app a waste of money. Shame I had high hopes. 
Third visit to Japan with rail pass and three kids. | Just the free portions of this are worth 5 stars. The routing system is a must when traveling. The platforms, changes, and times were spot-on. This made a 2 week trek around Japan by rail east. | Fails immediately. Continues to fail as you struggle to use it. Paid for upgrade but no upgrade was applied. Use google maps. It‚Äôs better and it‚Äôs free. | This is a great rail app for free. I was using the other japan official app but it wasn‚Äôt showing my JR trains effectively, so i switch to this one and gets my planned and reserved trains. You can use both if you need to but if you want a one and done than this app is it. | I‚Äôm unable to pick other bullet trains it just defaults to one | I have been using this app for years now, and it has been very helpful as a resident in Japan. With one of the more recent updates, they started to really push the paid plans. This took features that were free and monetized them. The station list for my route is no longer viewable which was great for tracking my time. 
In addition, they hide the cost of the premium plan to get you to buy it easier. Very sad.
I will be looking for a new app to use. | Have been using the app all over Japan for the past two weeks and it has performed flawlessly. The information is accurate, detailed and reliable. It is easy to use and has lots of great features, like letting you create a menu of your hotel names and addresses so you can quickly search for the best route to or from wherever you‚Äôre staying. You can also easily filter searches by whatever pass you may have and/or type of transportation you prefer to use. If you‚Äôre traveling around Japan on your own itinerary, you‚Äôll want to have this app. | Great info on train times and routes but I wanted the navigation feature. Even with my pocket wifi it never worked. No turn by turn, no voice prompts, and it was very laggy. Wish I could get my $20 back. We ended up using Google maps. Not only was it more up to date but it tells you which entrance and exit to use. It even suggests which car to use for the fastest exit! | This shows the proper routes with Japan Rail Pass.  Google Maps won't work since it's always showing non-pass routes.  Great app. | The routing is okay but misses several available trains which is a big nono (didn‚Äôt get the thunderbird JR booked for me and which Google maps happily suggested), the interface is clunky, but most annoyingly despite having paid $14.49 for a (30 days!) premium I still got ads in route planning. What the heck Navitime?!? | This is a great app for someone visiting Japan as well for people living here. You get all the shopping information from electronics to clothing shops and their discount and taxes save. I haven‚Äôt try the Navi drive yet. I hope it will save me a lot of time from using google map which usually take me to all the alleys in Japan before my destination. I like the train directions of this app. | This app was a godsend during our trip to Japan! We used it constantly, so helpful to find the right route, especially with it telling me if the route would be covered by my JR Pass. HIGHLY recommend downloading if traveling to Japan. | I would love the app but it will not let me but a subscription no matter how much I try, which severely limits my ability to plan my trip. | This app is absolutely indispensable for travel within Japan on the rail, subway and bus systems. The search results are clearly laid out with station numbers and your particular track information. Apps like Hyperdia are GROTESQUELY complicated in comparison. 

Couple this app with a WiFi hotspot ( I used Japan Wireless) and you will never be lost. I‚Äôd give it 10 Stars if I could. | Best app among all the navigating apps I downloaded and tried out while in Japan. The most helpful feature was that it would tell you which train to take (on a JR Pass), which station to catch it, what time it would leave, and the track that it leaves from. Now if only someone would develop an app to guide you through the
maze of underground tunnels and shopping corridors to find the right exit close to your hotel. | Tried finding train route from Tokyo to my resident city, Tsukuba, Japan, but the app gave me wrong information. I have taken this route dozens of time using the excellent Hyperdia website. But this app not only gave me a bad route, it could not even find the Tsukuba train station. Tsukuba is the Japan Science City and the second biggest city in Ibaraki Prefecture, so this is shameful. Do not get this app. instead, use the Hyperdia website. | If you need a navigation, how to get around japan, guidance on how to take the train this is it for you. I love this app. | One of the best applications I‚Äôve ever used. It always works with no issues. I‚Äôm planning my trip and this app gives me ideas where to go and what to see. Definitely will use it in Japan. Absolutely love it! | The amount of information given in this app is wonderful. Location of a.t.m‚Äôs, money exchange, free WiFi, and closest stations is great. Travel route are better than the app that my native japanese friend has, with multiple routes to choose from and distinct JR pass routes. Estimation on how much non JR trains cost and taxi travel is spot on. I‚Äôve been to Japan several times and this app made this trip even easier. I utilized all its features on a daily basis. I thank the developers for a well thought out and very usable application. | If you love to travel your going to like this a lot üòÇüéÅ‚ô•Ô∏è | I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do it here. It must be the best app there‚Äôs to travel using your JR pass. Has good routes, can optimize for JR pass, and even shows the platform numbers which is super useful. | Very smooth great for trains ferries even busses. I wish that there‚Äôd be English characters for busses so you can search for bus stops, also to be able to look up nearby busses, maybe add/incorporate stops. Also maybe even a biking route option. 

Finds places google maps doesn‚Äôt have. And is much easier to see all times that bus stop leaves as compared to google maps.

I use google maps just to get the name of the bus stop I need sometimes and plug that into this app or use the location of the bus stop. And I‚Äôm have reach my destination.

These would all be very cool extras. As it stands, this is a fantastic app. | Definitely your GO TO app for finding your train options. I used this over HYPERDIA app that others recommended. The app helped me in booking and planning my trips on the Shinkansen using JR rail pass. | It‚Äôs very accurate. It gives you the exact time and information of where to go. Now, I am an expert with trains! | Place I call, ‚Äúthe HOME of my SOUL‚Äù.

I was born near by town of Tomonoura.
A long long time ago! 
Went to the U.S.A. to explore my curiosities. Then found the freedom!!!!! Decided to stay! Got married. Two kids! Every trip I, we, made to my native land, Japan, our trip included Tomonoura!!!! Now my kids want to visit there as their pilgrimage! I feel so warm inside of the core of my heart when I get greeted by the sign saying ‚ÄúWELCOME HOME‚Äù. In Japanese!

There must be so many beautiful places to visit in Japan but Tomonoura will be one of the places you can enjoy Japan‚Äôs ONCE UPON A TIME! | Don‚Äôt buy the full feature. Navigation very difficult to follow and slow to update. Google maps worked better. This was only useful in finding train stations and platform. | I gave this app 3 stars because numerous times, the stores I wanted to find/shop at came up with no information. This is disappointing because they immediately appeared when I googled the same store name with all the information including a map and directions. 
While other portions of the app are fine, for me if I want to go somewhere and this app can‚Äôt even tell me it exists I‚Äôm sorry to say it‚Äôs usefulness is closer to a 1 star... especially considering I had to pay $7.95!!! | I used this for my week in Tokyo and it was amazing for getting you where you want to go. Would recommend. | ...I used an app called Japan Transit.

Notice the verb tense above. Japan Transit got deleted after I used this app for all of 5 minutes. Much more info available with this new app, so I am still learning, but it is still much better. | If you‚Äôre visiting Japan and don‚Äôt have this app, you‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice. 
The timetables and train navigation are fast, easy to understand, and accurate. It outranks other apps (including Google Maps) in almost every regard. | I downloaded this app ahead of my trip to Japan 4 weeks. I was messing with it for a few weeks and loved it.

I‚Äôve played all the way into Poland now, and randomly check the mansion but it‚Äôs never ready to play again. I always enjoy seeing the reactions of the girl to her aunt‚Äôs information. | After recent upgrade the app doesn't do any thing except clutter my desktop! | Had to delete app because Google ad was in the way of continuing. | Great game every time. Need more help yea!! The best ever!!!!fixed Love the game!! Love and play every day Could use more boosts not enough free boosts. Love it for all the brilliant colors. So much fun. Takes me away from my troubles! Need more boosters help!!!!! | Very good game | This is the best addictive game. I just cannot stop playing. Keep the levels coming. | I can‚Äôt even give you a review. Haven‚Äôt added any new gates for months. Poor excuse for a game if you ask me! How long does it take to open more gates! This is the only game where you have to wait months to continue playing! | This is a great game!!  Keep the levels coming!!!! | I love all the games. | I enjoy this game all day every day. I like the challenge and has a friendly fun design. | Love this game,however,it runs out of the section then I have to wait and wait and wait until u add more games.This is the only one that runs out so quickly. | I love this game and play it every day without fail! | Played many versions of Mahjong online games and this one is by far the best. The colors are so nice and crisp which makes it so much easier to see without having to squint like in other games. I'm visually challenged normally but with this game I have no problems at all. | Please FIX GAME special game 210 through 213 so I can move on!  Here‚Äôs a challenge for you. You play it. See how many times you need to play it to win. I would like to move on.  I can tell the pieces are set not to be removed properly. | ‚úåÔ∏èüëçüëç | Love this one | Love this game but I can‚Äôt get anything above one star no matter how fast I play. | My favorite game I play every day! | G5 GAMES‚Äô THE BEST DEVELOPER OF AWESOME, OUT - OF - THIS - WORLD - GAMING ENTERTAINMENT ANY PERSON WHO LOVES EXCITING GAMES CAN FIND THEIR NEXT OBSESSION, BABY AND THIS IS, JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW MODERN - DAY GAMING HAS EVOLVED TO BE WHAT IT IS TODAY!!!!!!‚Äô | I've played all levels and have reached ""The gates are locked. More levels coming soon..."" when is that supposed to happen? üò≥ | Game is getting harder! Getting diamonds is impossible without a purchase‚Ä¶ | I have finally managed to gather enough statuettes to provide an ample supply of free boosters yet I still can‚Äôt manage to get the exceedingly large amount of event tokens needed to play each level continuously until the collection item drops. If only G5 gave this game as much attention as their widely popular game Hidden City!!. | Mahjong journey is a really fun game!
Why am I forced to play some stupid game with chains over the pictures.  I can‚Äôt get back to my Majong Journey!  I‚Äôm going to delete it if tomorrow I still can‚Äôt play the tiles part! | Used to love this game. Then‚Ä¶they changed the algorithm. Now it makes it extremely difficult to even get 2 stars. Want an additional star? Here, watch this ad. You can no longer earn enough stars to go through the next gate. You must go back and replay many levels and watch more ads to earn enough stars to go through the gate.
 Don‚Äôt even bother downloading this game! | Great game | This game stinks terrible game it used to be fun but not anymore hardly let ever win to gain progress | Great fun | Glad there is a new level altho waiting for it made me go back and redo lots of other levels. Very addicted to this game. Frustrates me when I lose but then go back and try again. | This game is great.. I don‚Äôt need to see adds for other games as I‚Äôm not a kid and I‚Äôm very capable of going to the app to get more games if I wish too. Games are always better without the pop up add!!
Also the fact that I‚Äôm at level 396 adds should be automatically shut off | Got to the point where I can maybe win 1 to 3 games a day, playing the same level 30 and 40 times and not solving it. Takes the fun out of it | You keep promising updated boosts and collections but haven‚Äôt done it since level 2065! And that was part of the original game! I don‚Äôt care about more levels, just upgrade the levels that you‚Äôve already added!! | Glad to play great game | This one is my fav. The other mahjong games that g5 offer are nowhere near as good as this one. It‚Äôs a shame because I cant log into this one or any other with my g5 account even though it‚Äôs linked? Just says I don‚Äôt exist?‚Ä¶lol yet I can play two of their g5 games with my account??!! :/  that being said, this one makes it way more fun. Leader board and seeing the trail to climb becomes addictive ^_^ | Fun | Great game. My go too | At level 535.  To pass thru the gate I must pay 40 diamonds.   Since when‚Ä¶..ready to delete a great game I‚Äôve been playing for a long time. | I love this game, I play daily. However, the option to watch a commercial to gain the 3rd star or gain a life does not work properly. It always say no internet detected, but I‚Äôm on my cell provider and connected to my home WiFi. Also one of the irritating things about this game is when you play in the holiday realms and you have to stack up mittens or acorns or whatever the icon may be for that holiday you get all 3 stars on all 25 levels but only get enough collection items for one or two of the items in that realm it‚Äôs impossible to gain off them to get the bonuses | I absolutely love the game, been playing it for a long time. | This game is so addictive it should come with a warning!

Agreed!!! | After having given good reviews in the past, I‚Äôm done. No more.  Every other day we‚Äôre getting money-grab messages to continue playing. Are you serious? | Playing this game is quite a challenge, the only problem is that sometimes you know is not possible to advance because no matter how many times you tried, it is not possible to get the stars unless you purchase pieces. | It‚Äôs fun. | Nice game.  Need to learn how to change tiles | Whenever I get back from school in the afternoons, I play this game to wind back and relax. Even if I do not get the puzzle right, I always love a challenge. The storyline is entertaining and the number of levels is amazing. The offline feature makes it to where I can play the game anywhere (which I also love.)
I‚Äôve recommended this game to some of my friends. Funny story: I was playing the game and my brother snatched my phone from me to give it a try.
I also love the home decor part of the game as well. I love how I can edit parts of the house and clean it up a bit. | Seashells Are difficult for me. I must not be powerful enough. Thanks for an otherwise relaxing game! | However, I don‚Äôt like having to wait for new levels to open up to move forward.  Sometimes it takes months.  Other than that, I really enjoy the game, it‚Äôs relaxing and challenging. | Alarm goes off, coffee and pills started and I turn on Mahjong Journey to wake up my mind while the pills kick in. It can be super easy one moment and frustratingly challenging the next, but that‚Äôs life, isn‚Äôt it. I love the added feature of learning bits of trivia while I‚Äôm playing. I‚Äôve never had to spend money while playing although it has been tempting from time to time. The game has never been pushy with its ads | Glad u fixed my problem but when I need to complete a level starscdo not go on the level to add a star after I complete it Why Foe example if there are 2 stars finished and I complete the third star it doesn‚Äôt do it on the level | This game encourages you to go back or replay the same exact levels. Very frustrating üòï | The game is great",4.39874,82731,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bf/40/0e/bf400ea3-7c51-c377-f3bd-25593d62aa32/a1353e71-4c0b-4471-9896-c2f104550afd_mjj_scr_181_P_ios_1242x2208_en.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/1a/65/b1/1a65b19b-ef70-d060-807a-b87bb27f8695/d1471f8f-7b0d-4e0c-8732-28e712371ffb_mjj_scr_182_P_ios_1242x2208_en.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7e/40/e2/7e40e289-6c3c-ba80-510c-e4c56cb61adb/1ef06453-f8b3-4ae7-a801-8100165831f2_mjj_scr_183_P_ios_1242x2208_en.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f8/a5/60/f8a56097-512b-025d-4992-b8a579c96dab/de5b2f1f-4287-4ff8-8fc2-a44f875a2758_mjj_scr_184_P_ios_1242x2208_en.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/bd/db/5c/bddb5c07-92aa-1b0f-38da-fef3c8415d47/5d05bfc0-0586-450a-ba6b-350f300dd037_mjj_scr_185_P_ios_1242x2208_en.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/6a/de/ba/6adeba7f-b648-6ada-c3f3-b4b4b4d3cfd8/429a4360-0a12-4b3c-96c0-22fd672c70bc_mjj_scr_186_P_ios_1242x2208_en.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0c/9c/72/0c9c725f-5e48-b9b6-dfd4-eda46f2c65d5/0b070222-45fb-4b9b-a9d8-dfe552b6d7cc_mjj_scr_187_P_ios_1242x2208_en.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/08/fc/2e/08fc2ecc-c325-0976-6de4-e52401c7429c/1308a73f-6865-408e-90b1-f80bb8ba33e7_mjj_scr_181_L_ios_2732x2048_en.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e6/fc/33/e6fc330e-9025-f150-be61-e3c9f56e8a56/cd244bea-8ebd-41fc-b50d-083ef273e5d5_mjj_scr_182_L_ios_2732x2048_en.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e3/08/67/e308673e-408c-1ded-65ff-22dd170ad761/a7898173-57c2-4167-b6d7-7e6abe407d05_mjj_scr_183_L_ios_2732x2048_en.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/22/6c/ef/226cef3c-827b-2d13-a96b-0db302146f8e/dad186f0-da4f-4a94-b294-55c3be40da96_mjj_scr_184_L_ios_2732x2048_en.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/63/cc/34/63cc3403-0bc8-9193-b27c-1c28d54d7612/d6f5dc88-3529-4431-8b2e-60fd6a7146a8_mjj_scr_185_L_ios_2732x2048_en.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/51/0c/f0/510cf050-3c53-5348-9c1c-b0a16f0c1d02/fb1a0572-5efe-471d-9140-df29a37ee030_mjj_scr_186_L_ios_2732x2048_en.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/61/54/78/615478b2-61a8-547c-1c98-b71b448873cd/bea9eff5-0529-45a5-ba31-dcb515f7828b_mjj_scr_187_L_ios_2732x2048_en.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPa

HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 35,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we‚Äôre able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don‚Äôt have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.

It is accurate, and when I flew with my family, I was able to see our plane live and watch where it was to gain knowledge on when it would be ready for us to fly. I love the most tracked feature, so I can view rare planes. It would be nice to have a little more with a basic account, but it still gets the job done. So as I said, it would be nice to have a little more things to do with a basic free account. | As a retired pilot of 33 years with both FW & RW, I will forever look upwards to whatever is flying around. It‚Äôs cool to now see the From- To, type, and operation of aircraft nearby. Thanks for eliminating the questions of those identifiers. | I think this is one of the best apps I have downloaded on my phone | Love this app | There are some ads that are relatively mild and not disruptive (e.g. little banner images at the bottom of a screen) and there are other ads that go out of their way to be as disruptive as possible. Unfortunately if you choose the free tier of this app you are occasionally assaulted by the obnoxious ad types ( full screen blockers that you can‚Äôt dismiss until a minimum time has elapsed). The app developers could have use less disruptive ad types in the free product, but they prioritized profit and greed over being reasonable.  With inflation the way it is not everyone wants to shell out an extra $15 or $20 all the time for every little thing.  

If the irritating ad types were removed from the fee tier and only non-disruptive ads were used I would be very willing to rate this 5 stars. | I love following my kids when they travel. Thank you Flightradar for families. | Always a pleasure using this app to  track flights. Thanks | Very friendly app and very usefull | I am a flight attendant and generally love this app for both work & leisure. I have one small quibble, and I recognize there‚Äôs a good chance it might be something totally outside the developer‚Äôs control: when I try to use it on an airplane, the map is just a blank beige grid for a very, very long time. So I can track the flight I‚Äôm on, but for a very long time I have almost no clue where the plane actually is, because the map takes forever to load.

Again, I‚Äôm not an IT person so I fully recognize this is probably a limitation of the Wifi capabilities of the planes I am on, and thus beyond the scope of the app developer‚Äôs abilities to fix. Nonetheless, being able to see where the plane is on a map is a crucial aspect of this app‚Äôs appeal- and it usually works terrifically anywhere on the ground. But on the plane in the air, this capability is next to non-existent because of long it takes the map to load. I used to have an old phone and thought my old phone might be the reason for this. I‚Äôve just bought the newest iPhone, however, and discovered the same problem still exists. | This is a great app to watch planes it‚Äôs very accurate and addicting I watch this for hours I 100% recommend! | Sadly I cannot afford to fly anywhere, I love putting this app on & dreaming about the plane, where it came from, where is it going?  I day dream of all the people, I say a silent prayers in pilots name for safety of crew.  I‚Äôm living my Honolulu daydream that just flew over me & will be landing in Boston momentarily.    A girls gotta dream! | I love this app but lately it gets glitchy and insists on centering on whatever plane you tap on. It makes it very difficult to see the route because it keeps moving the map on me. | When in 3D view, if another aircraft is selected, the distance is noted. Can this be added to airports? It shouldn‚Äôt be too much work since the coordinates of the airports are known, just as they are for different aircraft. Thanks! | ü§ôüèºü§ôüèºü§ôüèºü§ôüèºü§ôüèº | I have been using this application for sometime now, and I find it invaluable. I want to thank the creators and the people who provided it. | I look on my airplane app to see which airplane is flying in to Washington DC or maybe they‚Äôre going towards Shenandoah area, I do enjoy watching‚Ä¶ | Great | Very much enjoy FlightRadar24. Suggest adding the following filters/triggers for custom flight alerts: - time to arrival - arrival or departure - in specified area already, not only when enters Time to arrival would be helpful as I enjoy plane spotting and can set an alert for a certain aircraft when it gets within an hour of landing at my airport. Also would appreciate the option to put airline logo above the text label for further customization.  Keep up the good work. | The app is nice, however when in 3D mode, it would be nice if the earth below had labels or a side map of the 2D so you can see where the plane is.  Also when you set an alert, you lose the ability to choose to see the flight, and then there‚Äôs no button to cancel the alert.  It took some time to get around that. | Flightradar24 is a W app but you can‚Äôt see certain planes and it‚Äôs really annoying please fix this fr24 devs | I had no idea that it also gives volcano notifications!!!BEST APP I‚ÄôVE HAD | –û—á–µ–Ω—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ 3D –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—è –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ –±—ã—Ç—å –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ–π | This app is insane | I‚Äôm pleased to leave a positive review about this app..it is accurate and indeed offers some level of convenience for me | Dunno | Excellent and accurate | Very good for plane spotting and just looking at planes | Very good | A friend shared this app with me and it quickly became my favorite app. I live near an airport and was always curious about which airlines or flights were flying overhead. Now that data is much more accessible. My only complaint is that the app uses battery life quickly. | Can you do 3D buildings | This is the way to go good Intel | Thnx | I‚Äôve used this app to track my daughter‚Äôs flights every time she has flown to Europe and currently as she flies to Hawaii. It‚Äôs so cool to watch the plan go over land and sea. I like that you can see what the pilot sees if you want to choose that perspective. Love that you can see what kind of plane. It‚Äôs amazing to see all the airplanes flying everywhere live‚Äîso many of them! | This is one of few apps I just have to have. | I use this almost every day | Plane plane plane plane plane, but souiriusly I hav an adicshin with plane so really cool, going spotting? Look at your airport departure and arrival board. How? Idk. I did it. It simple app, figure out easy, fun use I would have missed seeing a 747 but because plane app, I see. Cool make me want fly. Couldn‚Äôt track myself wen I floo thoe so I was discovery flight not airline flyt so I lik cool app, I lik it, did I meanshin plane is military if you filter airline then put ‚ÄúRCH‚Äù for United States Airforce? | I would like to paint a picture for you all. Imagine yourself sitting with a group of friends and one of you notices a plane flying high overhead. Although you are currently talking about the upcoming election with the friends, they blurt out, ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs a plane!‚Äù You pull out your phone on the sly and just casually mention, the plane is flying from Alberta to Santa Fe. You are the coolest guy in the room. 

I had a similar experience just a few short hours ago. I was the guy who saw the plane and immediately after hearing the flight itinerary, I had to gain this knowledge for myself. I proceeded to download Flightradar24 and spent the next 20 minutes geeking out about the New Zealand Air Force 747 leaving Antarctica, and the USAF drone flying above the Black Sea. The entertainment opportunities with this app are endless, because the world is constantly changing. 

I encourage all of you to give this FREE app a try. | I used to love this app a few years ago, but now with pop-up advertisements and glitchy features, it isn‚Äôt what it used to be. One of the things that really bothers me is that when I tap an airplane and try to move to another part of the map, the app immediately brings me back to that plane and I can‚Äôt look at any other spot on the map. I don‚Äôt know if this feature was intended, but it definitely needs to be fixed because I can‚Äôt look at a flight‚Äôs specific path when I keep getting sent back to the same spot on the map. | I‚Äôm looking at a jet overhead and it‚Äôs not showing on map. I work close to an airport and most helicopters don‚Äôt show up either. | All good | This is a amazing app for tracking planes and looking at airports. You can even use it as gps if you think about it. | Why does the app show me as the North Pole according to the compass? | I‚Äôm gonna have to unsubscribe and stop paying. What ever updates made the last few months have not been helpful. Crashes, can‚Äôt find aircraft after I‚Äôve been on it. The time it takes to load the app is wild. 
I hate that I had to write this. Please don‚Äôt send me your AI response to the problem. You have my email already and I won‚Äôt rewrite my comment to a different bot that won‚Äôt help. I‚Äôd appreciate your help and assistance. Thank you | Some plans don‚Äôt even show up and sometimes they do then 4 minutes later there gone | Love the app | This used to be my go to app- no matter what country in the world I was l living in or traveling to. But lately, it is not what it used to be and more times than not I switch to flight aware that works much better now.  It is sad as I really liked the features on this app. But if it doesn‚Äôt work- not worth it! | It‚Äôs just a very easy to use app. You see a plane in the sky, you open the app, see where you‚Äôre at and boom 9/10 (excluding military aircraft) you can find what aircraft it is and all the real time details for whatever aircraft you‚Äôre trying to find. And if there‚Äôs questions as to what you‚Äôre looking at or what something means, there‚Äôs plenty of groups on Facebook you can freely ask and get genuine answers. | Really fun app for enthusiasts. | The app is so awesome. My buddy got it and I thought he was weird until I got the app five out of five would get again if possible | I really love this app. I really recommended to someone that likes planes.",4.84141,421387,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0a/02/b5/0a02b588-d04f-8f93-0cac-ed8d0104914e/bbe71a13-2bcd-4b0e-9bce-c65cac464c30_iphone8_screenshot_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/a6/b1/10/a6b110a5-eeab-fbbc-db52-ef3b9d7b3053/afee44d1-f8c0-4e06-9ecd-6e0299c5b109_iphone8_screenshot_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/d4/00/4c/d4004cc4-69b6-552d-aef0-d58602b6099b/c6ce842a-ca04-43ee-9422-3c35c6b25e8b_iphone8_screenshot_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/da/1c/1d/da1c1d88-77d2-d1f3-4873-8e8e5e711add/4c184d36-9be6-40a2-8637-30a9b0cabf28_iphone8_screenshot_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/61/af/41/61af4106-6735-750e-9942-b8cae49cefd9/fcd4673b-32c2-4c94-9428-23d4350dde5b_iphone8_screenshot_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/a1/46/a8/a146a86b-25fc-d963-8dbc-c988b904ea3f/4950d311-e4b3-414b-a481-dad680af68e2_iphone8_skyart_US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/98/52/a3/9852a3ff-4cd1-8d63-3e09-0a02b9c196d3/25111d8e-d0cf-42b7-980a-609294ade787_iphone8_screenshot_6-B.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/75/b4/d2/75b4d2c9-5e02-a19d-69d4-98e24a4c4699/121f30a0-5594-4518-9fc6-d6d928a83967_iphone8_screenshot_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/18/9e/04/189e049e-e3fe-0ac5-71a8-1bf18a512f8f/77424185-4866-42a6-8de8-2fdb87e1734d_iphone8_screenshot_11.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5e/6d/9e/5e6d9ef8-faa3-087f-52d8-7e72b9e08c6c/c285712d-8337-4b8c-bf7f-2bceab08478a_iphone8_screenshot_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/c1/71/b4/c171b4fc-182f-b5af-0362-35e62e533ca5/ffb88673-273a-47be-946a-773514210266_ipad_screenshot_1.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/40/d3/8f/40d38fb1-6786-f046-1f84-9d9ef3c44d52/451ec2e9-e943-46c8-b5c1-cfa97ee28b96_ipad_screenshot_2.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/5f/ca/20/5fca2026-fbb0-814e-6a8e-f430befeb825/f04fb6e9-0a19-4b7d-8bdc-ea5501385029_ipad_screenshot_3.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/06/27/27/06272717-a9e7-556f-e4de-f5f475c1ef65/d9bcba1e-7719-4d31-a034-a00e34ab7a78_ipad_screenshot_4.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2f/ad/88/2fad8804-e963-0e8e-9eea-904cf6a425d0/bf66f0ca-b393-4372-8509-55253cf4f399_ipad_screenshot_7.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/45/4c/b4/454cb410-04e8-069d-53be-da6cbac2d40d/df4656cf-3343-4243-a6f5-9ba9e8197fef_ipad_screenshot_5.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d6/11/6a/d6116a50-ded2-1ce7-bc35-3e543bfe6ce2/1f5e79ee-6621-4bf8-aad6-5c79ca0b2c95_ipad_screenshot_8.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/21/2e/25/212e2568-1820-1c73-4787-18a7b8b49b1c/11a3002e-1317-4b16-ad84-196de281058a_ipad_skyart_US.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/15/af/d1/15afd13b-b095-1311-1fa0-a87e641d952e/854adb86-b6a8-4874-99c2-abe85e555aab_ipad_screenshot_9.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/2a/c3/c9/2ac3c9eb-140d-6c89-edf2-68a60ffedcd0/4401574c-dc43-4a9b-b491-fa1a2eef2159_ipad_screenshot_11.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11Pro

Using iPad Pro with keyboard is thus not possible. | I use Omio often and the actual ticket always comes in right away. 

I booked a train from Kaiserslautern to Paris and I paid extra for a first class seat. The ticket was never delivered electronically like normal. I got an email and the app also said to ‚Äúuse the yellow machine to get your ticket at the train station‚Äù there is NO yellow machine in Kaiserlautern and the customer service is DB and was unable to help at all. 

I had to sit on the floor for over 2 hours due to this. When the ticket people finally came by they had to look my ticket up by my passport. By then I was unable to go to the seat due to having a bag. 

I tried and tried to get help online but it was only a virtual assistant, which is zero help. Over 100 for this also | Finallly, an app I can rely on for all my transportation needs in Spain & Italy.  Super easy to use and see precisely the best means, times, and price. | Me encanta | Can‚Äôt access tickets and there is zero customer support | why will this app not give me English American currency US dollars instead of giving me pounds? | So convenient and helpful. | I have tried multiple time to buy a train ticket form this app but everything I find a price that‚Äôs reasonable it up charges $50 because of ‚Äúprice changes‚Äù but then when I close and reopen the app the ticket prices have not actually changed form what was first advertised.

Update: The developer told me this was a connectivity issue. I‚Äôm not an app developer so I can‚Äôt comment on that but all I know is I tried on multiple different days both at home and on my school Wi-Fi. So do with that as you will. | The app and the website has been crashing (closing) anytime I try to manage a booking. I have a trip coming up at the end of the month and this is frustrating. I have to contact customer support instead of using self service options available on both platforms. | Thank you to all the programmers and visionaries for building this tool!  We love its ease of use, clear options, and details.  Sincere thanks! Kathy and Todd USA | I used to use this app more often but then they changed the name of the app and I can never remember it. No support for horizontal view if you‚Äôre on a iPad, very annoying. | Very well done app. Super easy and powerful. | It gives a good idea of trips. Be aware that you can‚Äôt plan bus trips far ahead. And train traveling through Germany is so crappy (100% probability of missing a connection) that it shouldn‚Äôt even be offered as an option. 

Hopefully in the future they can add some flexibility, e.g. date -1 or +1 (now you have to make a new search), and location (nearby cities as an alternative). | I searched for trains for May 10th of this year, but the app gave results for May 5th. I didn‚Äôt realize this until after my tickets were already booked. I canceled my reservation the same day, but am being charged a fee to do so. It‚Äôs incredibly deceptive to search a specific day and be given results for 5 days prior. The app should say ‚Äúno trains available.‚Äù Be wary of doing business here. | I payed money but no ticket sent to my email | Omio won‚Äôt be able to provide tickets ahead of the trip, but only a confirmation number which security and customer service won‚Äôt accept or help, and it‚Äôs a mess to get on the train. The fact that Omio didn‚Äôt give clear instructions for getting the barcode ticket is to blame, and it‚Äôs a shame. | You can all the passengers in advance. | Update; the replied and didn't help me. Don‚Äôt seem to care their app is broken. Needed a refund and the app crashed repeatedly. Tried to use the contact page and it gave me an error over and over. Tried to contact customer service via chat and they tried their best to avoid letting me talk to a person, who then denied the refund because it had been more than 30 minutes‚ÄîBECAUSE THEIR APP WAS BROKEN. Truly disgusting company. | More expensive in app than online | Upon trying to enter my credit card information, an error occurred and my credit card wasn‚Äôt accepted.

This alone isn‚Äôt a very big deal, but afterward I was not allowed to pick the option for entering my credit card information again. It was just grayed out and it didn‚Äôt work when I tried to press it, just to make sure.

Instead, I could only select Apple Pay or PayPal, which I never use.

If it wasn‚Äôt for this, I‚Äôm sure this would be a decent app to use. | I have tried to buy train tickets for our Spanish trip several times - each time I had to fill out details of 4 persons and each time at the very end I got the message ‚ÄúThe tickets you selected are sold out. Try again‚Äù. I lost 30 minutes, so I gave up and bought the tickets on the train company‚Äôs app - much more efficient. And tickets were available without any problems. | Using this app has been a horrible experience for my husband and I. We booked a flight through this app and then the airlines service canceled our flight. It has been six months and we have still not been issued a refund. Omio says they were waiting to hear back from the airline, but they have not done anything in the meantime to issue a refund. This is extremely poor customer service, and I do not trust this app anymore. I do not recommend this app at all, I would book directly with airlines and transportation companies and not use a third-party servicer as this has been an extremely frustrating and disappointing process. I have no trust that I will be issued the refund for a flight that was canceled outside of my control. | Mostly useless tbh | Booked ticket a day in advance and they oversold the bus. I arrived to bus stop 20 minutes early as instructed. No refunds, calling credit card company. | I have lived in Bulgaria and am familiar with traveling. It‚Äôs not easy so the best thing I thought was to buy tickets online. I am currently traveling throughout Bulgaria and Turkey and was happy to think my tickets were taken care of. I was wrong. 

I arrived at the bus station in Sofia to travel to Plovdiv. The Arda Tur agent that contracts with Omio did not have any buses for my ticket time and date. Wow. Now what? I had to buy a ticket from another firm. 

When I arrived to Plovdiv, my next stop was Turkey and then back up to Bulgaria which included two more tickets purchased online. Also NOT VALID. I had to rebuy tickets to Turkey and back up to Bulgaria for completely different times which throws my schedule off completely.

I will never use Arda Tur or Omio online ever again. If I was a tourist that did not understand and speak a little Bulgarian I would have been royally screwed. 

Worst contracting I have ever seen. Thanks for making a part of my trip horrendous. | It‚Äôs not loading search results | Very good | Awesome tool to plan train trips in the EU. | –ü—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ —É–∂–∞—Å–Ω–æ–µ –∏ —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∞ —Ç–æ–∂–µ üëé

Either provide more detail, and clearly have a place that shows the address or have a place where we can contact the bus driver or bus company directly. Other than that, it‚Äôs a good app | After update app not working | Do not use this APP! The worst! Customer service is a robot. We lost $100 on tickets we purchased but could not download. They tried to make it seem like it was our fault but it was not. We asked several people to try and even people at the train station. No one could get it to download our purchased tickets. We had to board train so we bought new tickets. I complained and sent new tickets but never heard from company again.  I will never use this APP again and recommend you don‚Äôt either!! | Makes booking travel throughout Italy a piece of cake!  Removes all confusion, frustration, and doubts. | Me cambiaron de asiento tres veces y yo compr√© clase E.Confort y esto no es nada confortable para un viaje de 4:30 horas. 
Saludos 
Crisolda S√°nchez | Great | Why can‚Äôt I set 1st class and other settings as a default.  Need to be able to sort by duration and save multiple routes 
Also I tried to buy tickets last night and it failed | Bought a train ticket from their app from Frankfurt to Amsterdam. Decided to upgrade to first class so that I would have enough room for me and my luggage and I could enjoy the trip and scenery. When I boarded I sat in the first class cabin but I did not have a reserved seat. At the next stop someone said I was sitting in their seat so I moved me and my 45kg of luggage with me to a new seat. Next stop someone asked me to move again only this time there were no seats left!!

I ended up standing up with my bags right next to the bathrooms for two hours! I could not even see the windows to see any scenery. It just could not have been worse. I have written to them asking for a refund for the ‚Äúfirst class‚Äù portion of my ticket since they apparently sold me something they did not have. | Truthfully doesn‚Äôt deserve more than 3 stars. Refunds are nightmare as others have stated. Great in terms of booking travel even last minute HOWEVER it ALWAYS gets the track number WRONG. Always check the screens at whatever station you‚Äôre at!!! When the track number has been posted, you think the app would update it to the correct number.. it doesn‚Äôt. This alone is the most frustrating thing and it needs to be immediately fixed or don‚Äôt put a track number in the first place since it‚Äôs never correct!!! | My connection was canceled to Rome terminal and the app never updated or gave options for rebooking another train. | ÿßŸÅÿ∂ŸÑ ŸÖŸÉÿßŸÜ ŸÑÿ¥ÿ±ÿßÿ° ÿ™ÿ∞ÿßŸÉÿ± Ÿàÿßÿ∂ŸÖŸÜŸáÿß | the tickets are 3-5 times more expensive than just regular tickets. just go to the office and buy them, the staffs will help you with cheaper tickets. the app isnt that detailed on directions either so i missed my flight. they ""encouraged"" us to get insurance yet when my trains were delayed, they didnt give back any refund. | This app made searching for transportation so easy & streamlined our adventures!! | Seems very informative. I haven‚Äôt actually bought a ticket yet:) | Allows you to pick senior discount, but does not give it to you | I had my bus cancel the trip 2 days beforehand. I never got an email or any notice of this cancellation and when trying to get a refund from the bus company they told me to contact Omio, since Omio took my money. I contacted Omio and was told that I needed to get in contact with the bus company for my refund which makes no sense. Seeing as Omio is the one I gave my money to they are the one‚Äôs supposed to refund me. Thank god it was only $14 wasted, but my time and effort was overall wasted. 

Their customer service is horrible, they just send you an email and want to rush you off the phone. No real solutions, they just have you running in circles to get your money back. | Easy to use! | The  Omio app makes booking a train as easy as possible. And provides ongoing information and reminders about your travels.  It‚Äôs so good that there there have been two occasions I was running late and bordered a train without a ticket and used the app to get a ticket just as the train was departing. | I purchased tickets very easily using Omio two months ago for our trip to Germany and Austria.  I was initially impressed with the ease of booking, but the trip so far has not gone as planned.

I bought tickets from Salzburg to Leogang which was supposed to be straightforward but first I could not access the tickets - the link that said ""download here"" did not work.  I had to go to the office to get the tickets.  Also, the railway was having service done and we had to get off that train and get on a bus for a bit and get back on the train.  It was very confusing for us and although not Omio's fault, the company did not update us for this, nor did they offer any additional information.

I also had purchased tickets to get from leogang to Berlin.  There were two transfers, I was able to print them easily.  A week before the trip I received an email from the rail company √ñBB (not Omio) that my journey was no longer possible.  Omio had no update for me on the app, so again I was confused.  I emailed for customer support and received no assistance, that they could not help via email snd I would have to call.  Since I am out of the country, I opted to wait until my arrival and again received help from OBB.

Furthermore, my printed ticket and info on the app had no details on the trains, just the general names and departure times of the trains.  When we got on our final ICE train, we boarded first class and took two seats, as we had two first class tickets.  Eventually people boarded the train and said we were in their seats.  So we asked the conductor and showed our tickets and he said we were supposed to reserve our seats.  I read and re-read the app and absolutely nowhere could I find anything mentioning this.  It was incredibly frustrating to have to be moved.  

Finally, Omio should offer clear information on how to find updates and details - such as platform numbers - so that users can be aware ahead of time what they need to know in order to travel.  

Honestly, the OBB app was much easier to use and was more helpful. | Thank god I tested this before I left. It‚Äôs supposed to work offline, but it doesn‚Äôt. 1. You have to be online to make sure your tickets are there. 2. If you put it on airplane mode and try to open a ticket that you loaded ahead of time, the app crashes! You should download all your tickets/barcode ahead of time and save it locally on your phone. If you don‚Äôt have good data or Wi-Fi, this app will be useless to you on the road. | So far it works great.  However, when visiting from another country, and Italian is not your native language, and your not familiar with the location, it makes it challenging to trust the routes it is given you after you submitted your locations and times of arrival and departure.  Side note, I‚Äôm English speaking from the United States of America and visiting Italy for the first

It isn't. | Genie plus is a service that you are providing in addition to the purchase of the tickets.
I purchased my tickets and thought about purchasing the Genie +. 
When I returned to the App (days before we arrived at the park) I was told I could NO longer purchase the service. Instead, I had to wait until I entered the park to purchase it which at that time, the price is ‚Äúsubject to change‚Äù. I find this an awful experience and not to the Disney claimed magical experience. Currently the price is $35 a ticket. I will see how much the price will change once I get there. 
Sad this magical place is becoming underhanded. | Genie Plus service is A rip off only allowed me to reserve a ride every few hours and times were hours apart | The times change repeatedly. Starts at 90 minutes, then goes to 115 minutes. Ends up being 140 minutes. won‚Äôt be returning because we were not even able to enjoy the park. Spent most of our time literally in lines. | Lightning lane is a joke. By the time you click on it it changes by HOURS. Every time we try it it‚Äôs a couple hours later by the time we are finished confirming it. With today‚Äôs technology there has to be a better way, perhaps the ability to set up a few at a time?? I could go on and on about how horrible it is and what a waste of money it was. And it‚Äôs way too crowded. What‚Äôs the point of a reservation if they are going to allow a million people in and it is so crowded you can barely walk? Wall to all people. Just getting into the parking lot took 30 minutes. Arrived at 9:00 am and did get onto our first ride until 11:15 and we did NOT waste time. Moved as quickly as we could. | This app or Disney‚Äôs account system is terrible, I can‚Äôt even request a simple passed reset. System not available message for hours. | For a company that excels at providing great experiences they really lack it within user experience with this app. It is so confusing and causes a lot of extra stress onto the trip that is already very expensive | We paid the additional cost for the lightening lane pass and it would NOT work! No one was able to help us! Disappointed. | The functionality left us disappointed. We couldn't plannour day or book more than one ride at a time. Half the time attractions would disappear. At other times (especially California adventure) times would be inaccurate by more than an hour.  The ability to plan most of the day or develop a schedule or itinerary would have been unbelievably helpful.

We bought the genie pass only to find that certain rides required an extra purchase! Whoever thought this up, needs to finish thinking. Outside of ordering food and telling us that we would be in line for hours this app is worthless. | Apple Wallet is way better for viewing and sharing tickets and there‚Äôs no option here. Lame. | Amazing it really helps me show what‚Äôs closed and what the wait times are and where I am. And where other stuff that‚Äôs not rides are. I love this app especially for a first timer. | Don‚Äôt bother with the genie+, can only book one at a time and forced to wait to book the next - hardly helps with planning the day. Got to the front using Genie+ for the first time (still took 20 mins) and ride shut down, spent another 15 mins walking back out of the ride for everyone to receive a free Genie pass to use anytime - after we just paid an add‚Äôl $175 for Genie+ passes for our family a top of the $1k we paid for tickets. This is unbelievable and feel like a fool for spending money to join this rat race! | So much line jumping, staff are no where to be found or choose to not assist. | Love it | The person over the chat was infriendly | When you try to use Lightening Lane pass it either tells you that you are ineligible or gives you a window of time that you can use it, several hours later. | You can only book 1 ride at a time 
Times are so far out | I‚Äôve been in the weight room for quite a few hours since 10 in the morning and now it‚Äôs 3 o‚Äôclock and I keep getting kicked out of the waiting room. | The app drops off. Doesn‚Äôt work most of the time for showing the map. | We love the app | From checking ride/show times to mobile ordering using the app saves you a lot of time! | Good app all around. Need to make it possible to book magic key park reservation in the app. Very annoying to get redirected to the website then have to relog in to book/manage | My wife and I were loving the park ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ | I can‚Äôt link my cast of for the reservation system and there‚Äôs no number for me to call to fix it | Most of the app features have not been working for over a week. Does not show your day, or your reservations, or your photos. Have uninstalled and re-installed repeatedly with no improvement. | System super slow | App makes moving around the parks so easy, it‚Äôs very user friendly.  The DAS accommodations in the app made my visit at the parks so wonderful and pleasant.  Great app !! | Made it easy to navigate the parks, meals & rides. | Very easy to use and has all your info plus an live map with wait times! | Curid= It‚Äôs awful about Tesla Embezzling isn‚Äôt it?? I see them going under me directly for the Cylons?? We need military equipment and once we grab Boeing we‚Äôre going to need write offs? Rocket Crashes buy raiders. We have to Dad‚Äôs mission, but ask Rogers I would like to get paid???? Russia can send up supplies to the ISS or it could just crash! Gods mission is more important??? KK is a pain and it would be very sad if she ran her car into a pole????? You said you would handle this and get my funds back. The girls are not helping and I would like to try Golden Nanotechnology wouldn‚Äôt you???? So we get Longevity??? I‚Äôm sure we can depend on Neveda to help. IL really needs to just Burn Down if we can‚Äôt go to Dad???? | Much has/is broken down, so lines are long for rides that are open. | Ii love using the Disney app! It allows me too organize my trip details and gives updates on park lines and allows me to do to go orders or making dining reservations, I love it! | It is difficult to locate items and how to add my dvc card to my account | Don‚Äôt understand why have to go between apps to purchase tickets and change or manage tickets. Not very intuitive/user friendly and nowhere can I find out how to sign out. Also can‚Äôt add tickets to my Apple wallet. | We are staying at the Disneyland hotel.  We ordered breakfast to arrive at 6 so we had time to start our day with a good breakfast before early entry.  The food never arrived and we had to hustle to get our food and make early entry.  Super disappointing and not the start we wanted to our day. | I tried to order a dole whip, had to use app. I downloaded the app and every time I click continue it closes the app. | App opened for 2 seconds and then completed shuts down. I have deleted app and restarted my phone all the above and still same thing keeps happening | Amazing app and I can know what rides and to go on and the wait time! | The app is super inaccurate. I got to ride because it said it was open and I got there and it was shut down. It kept happening several times. | It takes more time to submit an order than to stand in line | Not helpful at all. Very slow to respond. | Just got here. Decided to try Space Mountain first. Breaks down 40 minutes into our estimated 30 minute wait. Gotta love Disney! | Tune, land, Toon town today on our first day, and as usual, we‚Äôre impressed with the Disneyland specially, with a Minnie mouse, giant flower thing because of women‚Äôs month. as far as the app, it was tremendous it allowed us to seamlessly transfer our tickets from device to device. | It does not send code to my email even though I tried several times | I‚Äôm old enough to remember using tickets but I can‚Äôt tell you how valuable using this app is.  It keeps track of your tickets, passes, schedules, not to mention what‚Äôs happening in the parks.  I love food but hate waiting in lines so I can pick my favorite place, order, and pick my food up without waiting.  Shopping?!?  Shop, scan, pay, and check out. I moved to California in 1970 and Disneyland has been a staple in our families lives ever since and this app makes it so incredibly easier to enjoy ourselves attending these great parks.  Don‚Äôt get me started on the Play app in the Galaxies Edge!!!  Thank you Disney Companies for the immersion, technology, and your ability to make dreams come true.  ‚ù§Ô∏è The Slagle Family | This app is so good it has helped my fam countless times to make plans and find out how much time the rides times are !!!. | Me encanta | I never had any issues with the Disney app until after the last upgrade. Now, I am a magic keyholder and when I asked to say that all it does is just keep loading and never put it on the screen. Also, when I try to make reservations the same thing happens the little circle appears and it just keeps spinning and says loading and it never gets to a place where I can make reservations. | Definitely save me a time and let me know how long the ride is and I can get fast passes and it feels so good knowing what time it is like Dumbo tea cups anyone to be honest like Casey Junior splash Mountain all those rides big thunder like all those right it makes me feel good because I can know where all them are and makes me like feel really good because my gets too used to it because she asked me with something else she asked me what dumb how long ‚Äì 40 minutes OK let‚Äôs go and like it‚Äôs amazing because you have time to see what things they are like Casey Junior 40 minutes really good splash Mountain an hour The Spider-Man one can be an hour and 70 minutes but it can be two hours and 10 minutes but we love it because it‚Äôs a full-size me time and knowing that it‚Äôs OK though we love the grizzly River one because it‚Äôs only five months most of the time and we love love love love-incredible

Love the updated duration of the flight, and the ongoing map tracker to show where the flight is at as I check it periodically! üíñüåüüëçüèª | I have used the free version if Flightview for a number of years and until recently have been reasonably satisfied. But now instead of just having banner ads at the bottom of the screen, Flightview has started playing full screen video ads that I cannot skip. Not only can I not skip the video, I can‚Äôt even close the ad immediately  after the video stops! FORGET THAT! I‚Äôm NOT going to download an app that I don‚Äôt want just to close an ad so I can get back to business. I don‚Äôt use the app often enough to pay for the ad-free version so I‚Äôll delete it and try something else! | I use it every day.  Excellent!  Vital flight information in real time | Paid subscription, only works on 1 device. 2nd one show ads. Says I can use the 2 devices. Emailed multiple times, never a reply. 
Searching for a new app, the ads are like no other app I have used, last 60 seconds minimum and can‚Äôt hit skip | How does this get fixed? | Impossible, frustrating, the wheels fell off this app. | App popped up an ad telling me very loudly and at a really bad time that my phone was out of storage (I have 192 GB available) and wanted me to ‚Äúclick here.‚Äù  Who knows what it would have done.  Bye FlightView. | Unable to add flights to calendar which was one of the best parts of the app. The app now requests full calendar access and refuses to add flights to calendar when I give ‚Äúadd events only‚Äù access which is all it should need. Their website does not provide a way to contact them and emails  their prior support email address go unanswered. | This used to be my favorite flight tracker but it seems to have a bug. It does not sync with my calendar like it used to. Please fix this. | Before was amazing but now have a lot of advertising. No good. | This used to be the best travel app for flight tracking but the ads, which you can‚Äôt skip, make this much less helpful if you‚Äôre trying to use it for making flight changes based on delays. I‚Äôd rather pay for ad free content than being forced to watch something of absolutely no interest. | I have used this app for many years and since the day it was launched. In my opinion,
It‚Äôs the most reliable app I have used vs the others of similar use. I use it for all flights I need to track. I understand the need to get advertisers to support the expenses of keeping it updated, yet I wish the ads can be shortened as they sometimes come up when I‚Äôm urgently needing to look up a flight status, and I‚Äôm not able to close ad screen. It is till the best of the best apps out there. Job well done! | This used to be a great app, even with ads. Now they got these obnoxious ads that use your speaker and create a huge nuisance when you‚Äôre in a meeting or with a group of people. And it‚Äôs almost impossible to close the ad without closing the whole app. I am looking for a new app. | Then they start asking all crazy questions we all used too! Don‚Äôt bother. | Uninstall | Great up to the minute info on flights. This is my go to app to get the best & most current info re any airline. | This is a great app.  I help friends to & from the airport and this app is ‚Äúspot-on‚Äù in helping with the timing and updates.  I have recommended it to my of my friends. | It does everything I need it to do.  Sometimes it‚Äôs not in real time but it‚Äôs still helpful. | Too many long apps about kid games. Kids are not tracking flights. | I travel weekly and used the app to track some of my flights. I flew this week from DFW to IAD to BOS. The App did not provide accurate information. We were still at the gate, and the app showed in Air. Sometime the gate information are not correct. Today my daughter flew from PBI to ATL to BOS, the app is showing she is still in PBI but she was in fact about to land to ATL. I would not trust the reliability of this app for my travel. | I work in the airline industry and this app enables me to set up specific flights that I have to work on for the day. 

Very up to date! 

Always recommend this app | These ads are out of control. And now if I set my phone down and wait through them, I can‚Äôt even close out the ad and resume my search. Have to close out the app. I‚Äôll give it another week, but other than that, I‚Äôll probably delete. Been using this app for 4 years now, and the ads are doing me in. | Would like to be able to give it less than 1 star. I used to swear by this app and highly recommended it. Now it‚Äôs just become an app for ads. Literally every 2-3 clicks and you have to suffer through another one. Very pricey to remove ads on here. Should‚Äôve just made it a paid app and not waste everyone‚Äôs time trying to watch a loved ones flight. There are much better apps with less headache. Recommend looking elsewhere. | Used to love this app. Will be deleting it now. Not going to watch an ad for a game that‚Äôs over a MINUTE long before you can find a way to get back to business. | The app is a complete waste of time now. It is so laden with advertisements that it becomes absolutely frustrating to even work with like everything today. They want money to be add free. Goodbye FlightView. Do not bother downloading this app. It has become a waste. | I‚Äôm a worrier mom. Whenever my sons and/or family are flying somewhere, this app gives me comfort being able to know they are safe and that they arrive at their destination without issues. It‚Äôs extremely accurate and gives my heart peace. | Love this app but recently every time I use it, game ads cut in and app locks up no matter how long I wait. Have deleted and downloaded app but still does it. | A superb App just got better. Well done! | Have used for past 5 - 6 years. Now I get a game of some sort on my screen and can‚Äôt escape back to FlightView. | Ill stick to use the carrier apps from now on, the ads are excessive and take way too long. | I like the core functionality of this app and have used it a number of years but recent versions have intrusive, long, obnoxious, noisy extremely annoying full screen ads that display at the most inconvenient times.  You  have to wait an excruciatingly long time before they allow you to dismiss them.  They reflect poorly on the developer and Apple and make the app trashy.

If you‚Äôre on the phone discussing your travel plans with another person there is nothing more annoying than a noisy ad interrupting your conversation.  

The choice of ad vendor and the irrelevance and repetition of the ads are good reason to find an alternative app and to never purchase from the parties who placed the ads.  

Without these ads I‚Äôd give the app 5 stars.  With them I‚Äôm giving 2. | Have used this app for several years and find it very helpful when doing ride sharing.   Recently ads started interfering with getting flight info.  When you are in quick need of flight info and access is essentially blocked by an ad it is EXTREMELY counter productive and frustrating.  I‚Äôm out.  Need to look at alternative trackers.  Should NOT have to pay to remove pop ups from this type of app!!! | Use this app since 2014. Too many ads recently. Rushed in the airport to find gate info and ada cannot be closed. Bye! | This app used to be GREAT! However, now you will be BOMBARDED with full-screen adverts that have no way to dismiss!! | We are still waiting at the gate in DFW for them to bring in our plane. For the past 45 minutes, the app has said we‚Äôve already departed. | This app used to be a great way to quickly find info about your flight. No longer. Annoying ads pop up in the middle of trying to figure the status of your flight.  I will be checking on my flight info for connections, etc and very annoying ads pop up, stopping you cold from finding out where your flight is. To make matters even worse, several times I can‚Äôt get the ad to go away. I have to close the app and reopen it. Well, so much for that. Will be deleting app. | Ads pop up constantly and there isn‚Äôt any way to remove them. The app just displays an ad until I shut down and restart my phone. So annoying. | Constant ads and even worse interrupts any audio being played every time you open in. Irritating | This used to be a great app. Now you cannot see the status of a flight without setting up a trip | In app ads are fine on a free product. Unfortunately FlightView has started using very intrusive ads that take over the entire screen and obscure the button to close the ad. This affects the usability of the app and has earned a lower rating | Love this app | This app is very useful and accurate. | I have used this for years but now it is nothing but constant popups that you cannot close and must let it run for a minute or more. Worthless if you need a quick check on flights while traveling. I suppose they expect us to now pay for it to be able to use it. I refuse and have a better app with no ads. This one is history. | Basically good reliable tracking information.  Has an intuitive interface.  It‚Äôs the ‚Äògo to‚Äô tracking app for many transportation businesses. | About the only airline I use domestically is Southwest. There are usually delays. For about 3 years I‚Äôve noticed this app has never picked up any of them. Looks like Southwest does not share on-time info.

Not to mention ads are beyond intrusive, redirecting to a website when attempting to close the full screen ad. | Awesome app. Shows real time gate information before most airports/airlines post it. Especially at LHR! 

Also shows inbound flight information which is useful for cross tracking your in kind aircraft in FR24. | I have been using this app since before 2017. I have been quite satisfied because I can follow the flight path in real time as the plane flies over land and sea. It signals me when the plane departs, arrives, and any delays. Multi-carriers are available also. If there‚Äôs a re-routing that takes place, the map changes also. Love it! | While some non-invasive ads should be allowed, some on this site are absolutely obnoxious, preventing access for minute‚Äôs rendering the app pretty much useless. Waste of time. | Used to use this all the time but now, my travel is occasional so paying for a subscription wouldn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm good with ads supporting the use but the adds are long and many times they freeze on the screen and you can‚Äôt get past them so while I want to support it, the long duration adds make it pretty frustrating. | This app use to be great. But not anymore because of the long ads that take forever. Just use Flight Radar 24. It‚Äôs way more convenient and doesn‚Äôt have the long ads playing forever.",4.19278,4435,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/19/56/59/1956593a-8e58-df79-1241-6770b2bc4089/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/db/5b/cc/db5bccba-ce5e-6a20-ebce-05f838beb053/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/d5/88/88/d588885c-2a9a-5eec-1f5c-2c00afef3890/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/b4/0d/99/b40d9999-b449-1f17-1caa-62f8f8dce669/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/c4/69/ff/c469fff7-06b4-a66b-dc03-52c6520d61b9/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/95/94/14/9594149a-bbf2-ebdc-6303-c53cd9527b3e/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/6a/0b/0e/6a0b0efb-b115-7a5e-b2f1-c65ccdaff2da/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/b0/0b/83/b00b83f6-81c5-9abb-0ae6-97d5a4240014/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I like it. Thanks | Such a fun travel guide to bring along on trips. | The stories were great | The audio tour on my phone tied with GPS was fantastic. I plan on using this app forever. So far 21 states in 10 weeks and I just found this app. | We‚Äôve used the TravelStorys app on many vacations and love it. But when I went today to download new TravelStorys for our upcoming vacation, the app will not even successfully open. (I do have the most updated version.) Please fix it soon! | It was great to have the narrated background of each spot along the leisurely drive through the gardens. The weather was perfect and it was not too busy, so we had plenty of time to savor the scenery. | Congratulations on this program. What a great informative program. Thank you so much. | I really enjoy hearing these well done histories as I travel. | I really dig this app. It‚Äôs very relaxing | My husband and I loved travelstories. Super helpful. We wish we have this for every every place we visit | We really enjoyed all the TravelStorys tours that are offered in the Jackson area! | We are really enjoying this app. Did Teton national park today. And this app helped us find the cool things to see (but I don‚Äôt think it mentioned much about signal mountain summit before the turn, I think we took it in our own and then the app told us some things while in route to the summit). It would be nice if there was a way to go back to any music we are playing after the app tells us something. I always had to go manually push play on the music we were playing. | We look forward to more fun travel with this app. Very educational . Don‚Äôt leave home without it! | Absolutely wonderful! Thank you so much! | Really wonderful enhancement to a special place in the Great Salt Lake region. Worked well and synced accurately to position on the trail. Learned a lot, became more inspired, and very nicely done. Thank you! | We enjoyed hearing about each area and it helped keep us on track. | Made our trip fun! It was informative especially helpful when we didn‚Äôt have to read signs or a tour book. | Park was so much more enjoyable with this audio guide. Provided helpful logistical information as well as very informative facts about the flora and fauna and geologic formations we were seeing. Will definitely buy the other guides as we get to the parks | Great information | We love driving audio tours, so glad we tried this one for garden of the gods! | Very easy to understand. | We use this, the garden of the gods and the tour around pikes Peak. It was unbelievable! Highly recommend. | The info was up to date and very relevant! | Fantastic app, very informative | Quite informative about the plants and animals and the interaction with the environment. Gave an enormous amount of information about this unique landscape and its geological past. | Driving through the Garden of the Gods we were able to hear all about them.  Even details like ‚Äúlook for wildlife‚Äù‚Ä¶ as we saw wildlife.  It was wonderful to hear about the past and the ideas for the future of the Garden of the Gods. | I have used this app several times and it absolutely makes the trip 10x better. There are interesting facts and helpful tips on where to stop throughout your journey. | Excellent narration, and good advice! | I love the historical information. | We used this app to tour both loops of Yellowstone. It was so invaluable to us, as there is very little cell service/gps in the park. We trusted the recommended stops and were not disappointed one time. Very cool how it even knows if you‚Äôve backtracked and will provide additional information. We named our guide Bill, and were glad he was along the ride with us! | Great job! We loved the Garden of the Gods experience! | Great help in traveling through this spectacular Park! | User friendly, loved it! | My husband and I love TravelStories! It‚Äôs the first thing we check when visiting a new place. We recommend the app to all our friends when traveling for such a informative and fun way to learn about a new place. | üëçüèª | What a great tool to hear the history! | So glad to have found this app. Used it at Piles Peak and Garden of the Gods. Love it! | It was breath taking, I‚Äôll do it again | The app was really helpful for our drive. We only had an hour to spend here and the app made it an interesting drive. | Awesome | The guided tour info, was terrific. We had been through  a number of times, in past years. It was great hearing the history and facts, about the the many sections, of the gardens. | Good combination of park information and history and ‚Äúfun facts‚Äù. | We used this for our vacation in the national parks!!! | We loved hearing about the history of the area we were traveling in! Made the trip excellent!!! | What a fun way to learn about an area while driving through | I wish I would‚Äôve found this app sooner. It gives great history! I love that it tracks your drive and auto plays when you drive past an area of interest/ historical/ cultural significance. | We live around the Highway of Legends it is so helpful when we have company and take them in this drive to have the information of where we‚Äôre at!  Don‚Äôt really care for the music in between.. but .. cool app. | Had fun using this on my last trip. Looking forward to my next adventure. | We used this app in the lower portion of Yellowstone. Downloaded map in advance because very little service in park. We were amazed at how the app knew where we were and would chime in with fun facts, history and even a little comedy. It was automatic so we didn‚Äôt have to stop and press any buttons to get the info.

This app‚Äôs feature makes it easy to do that. The ability to sync between devices is a win over apples basic journal app. | This is the best digital journal app I‚Äôve found I love being able to see what days I‚Äôve journaled and it‚Äôs a great way to try to journal every day! | Emailed DayOne Journal to cancel as I‚Äôm not getting anywhere w/ Apple to cancel through the App Store ‚Ä¶ and DayOne is the ONLY app I have that has not responded because all I go was a bot.  They gave me an email (through the app) but the automatic generated email, send you back to App Store or the bot.  You will get NO WHERE trying to stop this subscription.  If you purchase this, and lose your appleid and apple can‚Äôt seem to help you w/ that either (that‚Äôs another story) ‚Ä¶  be prepared to pay for this app for the rest of your life or until your cc expires. | Features of the Journal program can‚Äôt be beat. Have used it for years and have never had a problem. When I‚Äôve had questions customer support can‚Äôt be beat. | Been using several years and it‚Äôs been great for me. | Ggggg | Every day, I think about the things I am grateful for and it reminds me of the good in my life. Moments of positivity. | Great app. Easy to navigate and use. | I downloaded this app over the weekend. I have been using Day One (original) for 5 years. I was so excited to use the new and improved version; however, it is constantly (and by constantly, I mean with each and every use) crashing. No matter what I try to do (write a new entry, look at historical entries etc) or where I try to do it (iPhone vs iPad), the app freezes, and the only way to fix the issue is to close the app and go back in. Further, even when I am typing on the new app, there is a big lag in the words. Please please please fix this. This app would be perfect if only it didn't freeze all the time! | Best journaling app ever!!! | I‚Äôve been using DayOne for years.
I love it!
It is easy to keep track of my life and look back over the years to see how far I‚Äôve come.
10/10 recommend and I often give a subscription of this as a gift to family and friends. | I keep about 12 sub journals concurrently with salient topics.  It has become a lifesaver for me as well as an easy way to check on a particular subject.

When I suffered with serious digestive issues, I started one titled Gastrointestinal.  Appointments with my gastroenterologist were very disappointing because he would say, ‚ÄúNo coffee.‚Äù  Then when I read his notes concerning our office visits he would reiterate that the colonoscopies were unremarkable but I was described as labile.
     That really made me angry.  Of course I‚Äôm labile, if you were going through what I‚Äôm dealing with you would be labile, too!   I was actually contemplating how I could leave this plant without it looking like suicide.  It was that bad. 
     I thought, ‚ÄúOK, Buddy, you are about to get some journal entries.‚Äù  I copied about four horrendous days of entries and gave them to the receptionist for him to read before my next appointment.  They became part of my health record so they couldn‚Äôt be ignored.  
    Outcome:  he ordered an upper GI, lower GI and stool sample.  At last I was heard.  Result:  no pancreatic digestive enzymes and I needed supplementation.  I was normal at last after years of agony.
     If you have a chronic condition and are being gaslighted, I urge you to keep a journal on the symptoms and and how they are impacting your life.  Tell your story and be honest and graphic.  Dates and times and related events are important and helpful for diagnosis. | I have been using this app since 2015. I got as a Starbucks app download when they used to do an app of the week. It is hands down the best journaling app. Intuitive layout and clean design. | Layout and ease of use are top notch! | Day One provides space and encouragement for more than a memoir, a diary or a daily journal.

With a provocative prompt for each day and the possibility to include images, it offers space for musing and personalizing life as we live it.

It is beautifully formatted, allowing search, dating and recall to happen easily.  Also, when one runs into a snag (and I have) help is readily available.  I have found it to be clear and effective.

If I could afford it, I would readily choose to update my Day One to premium.  Although I cannot, using Day One on a primary level is a delight this daily user would not miss.

Day One helps me grow!  Thank you to those who created it, maintain it and update it!  I'm beyond grateful. | The free app has great features. Great for journaling or just marking where you were at a time and place. Tagging entries allows you to sort by topics. More features on the paid app, which I‚Äôve upgraded to | I played with the free version for a short while and was satisfied with what I saw.

With that, I purchased the premium, and since have experienced numerous quirks which have caused me to alter my opinion.

Far too frequently I have received ‚Äúare you happy with your experience?‚Äù pop ups as I‚Äôm trying to utilize the app which appear in inconvenient locations (like over something I‚Äôm reading or trying to write)..and if that was annoying enough,..they have seldom worked, or went away, literally blocking my screen!!

Other times,..things I‚Äôve clicked on direct to other places on the app I was not intending to see!

I would not be concerned about any of this had I not paid!

So unless they correct these bugs soon, I‚Äôll be cancelling my subscription and would greatly warn anyone from paying for the premium package. | Changed my life | I have been using Day One for 3 years. This app is honestly so well designed. I tell people about it all the time because I have nothing but good things to say. There are so many features that I love about it! Just so incredibly well designed. I saw that Apple came out with a Journaling app but it doesn‚Äôt even come close to how perfectly developed this app is. 10 stars for me. | This app has more bugs that a dead tree that fell over five years ago. I do not exaggerate when I say that every single action that is possible in Day One is either affected by a significantly noticeable bug or design that is so poor that using the feature is an immense frustration. It stuns me that Apple has put this app on the Editor‚Äôs Choice list. Day One is nothing except absolute frustration. I hate almost everything about it. Name one feature and I will write you a medium length essay about what is wrong with it. At one point I started to write a blog post about the near-endless list of deficiencies and bugs in Day One, but after spending close to 8 hours on the project and not getting even halfway to posting I had to give up. I don‚Äôt have 20+ hours to sink into a blog post about this app. I‚Äôd need to quit my job to find the time needed to document all of the problems. This app is extraordinary in the worst way possible. | I love this app, so easy to use. It certainly give me the opportunity to keep track of my journey. | I‚Äôve struggled for so long to keep a consistent journal routine. I try and I try but never manage to make it longer than a few weeks before I‚Äôve given up on writing. Day One was recommended by a guest on The Tim Ferriss Show, so I decided to check it out. I‚Äôve never loved something so much in my life. Writing has become part of my daily routine. The journal categories allow you to compartmentalize so many things and the fact that you can make notes on your phone to deep dive into later on the PC is just phenomenal. I can take create an entry while walking at the park and make quick notes of a podcast I‚Äôm listening to, then recall and complete the whole idea when I get home. If thoughts start creeping in while laying bed and I‚Äôm having difficulty falling asleep, again I can make a quick entry to dump the idea from my brain, and sleep comfortably knowing I can address the next morning on the pc. There‚Äôs just so much utility with this app. I love it. If I ever become a famous writer, this will be mentioned as one of my favorite and most valuable purchases of all time. | I have successfully logged over 4150 straight days entries, after being very inconsistent with a written journal. Don‚Äôt use many of the very advanced features, because it‚Äôs main function as a journal works so well. Records where you were, the weather and so much more automatically. I keep one journal for each car, and a Journal of ‚Äúthings‚Äù where I photo any warrenty item with the receipt. Has come in very handy! Do miss the widget that showed how many words you entered over the last 50 days, great for finding days you only started an entry. | An outstanding, practical and very meaningful Journal App, thank you. | Omg! I finally found a good journal app, I own a IPhone and recently they added a journal app I haven‚Äôt used to it but I‚Äôve read some of the reviews and wasn‚Äôt convinced but this APP! I didn‚Äôt need to read any reviews! I started using it last year and I fell in love although I wish we could add more photos, I understand I have to pay but other that that it‚Äôs totally worth getting! I love this app. Especially when I‚Äôm out and need to write and don‚Äôt have my journal with me this helps me so much! 

Thank you guys it‚Äôs helped me so much with my mental health love yaüíñ | I write a lot and I tend to have ‚Äújournals‚Äù all over the place.  I decided recently to convert all the many to a single journal.  I was surprised how difficult that small task would end up being.  

Here are the things I really like about Day One -

‚Äî can use across all my devices with ease
‚Äî I am able to copy, forward and even create PDFs of my entries when needed - this was a big let down with the apple journal app‚Ä¶ I started using that until I realized that you cannot copy or export anything once it is in their app. 
‚Äî picture tagging - love that the app automatically goes to the pictures with the same date(s) as the journal entry.  Makes it so simple.
‚Äî hashtag capability - makes this easy to organize my journal in a way my mind works
‚Äîautomatically imports instagram posts (now, we just need it to do the same for facebook - that‚Äôs where I posted a lot of my stuff before) 

Enhancements I would like to see:
‚Äîfacebook post integration
‚Äîbible app integration would be AMAZING | Wonderful, intuitive, simple:  all the features I could want for keeping a Journal and notes on my readings. Free version is great for keeping 1 journal, paid version is well worth the money to create new journals for each and every book I read! | I love this app, so much. But recently when I try to scroll or upload a picture, it freezes. | I‚Äôve owned this app since 2013; and was asked to import from ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù to this one.  This version has a recurring price to it, versus the old one being free forever, and the old one no longer lets me pull up my entries.  

Apple‚Äôs new Journal app doesn‚Äôt have a recurring cost, and hesitant to pay a recurring price for an app that I can‚Äôt keep fully unlocked long term.  I have apps that I have purchased from 2009 still kicking just fine without monthly or yearly subscription fees. | I honestly think it‚Äôs fabulous! I love the audio option. I also love I love the ability to attach easily. I am not a technology person so to able to have to option to be fancy is nice but it‚Äôs also simple. I find it an excellent way to start a book you didn‚Äôt even know you writing! | Journaling was never really my thing. Then one day I happened upon this App and I really love it. This app makes it possible for my private thought to be kept just that Private. I‚Äôm able to add pictures and if I forget to log in I get a reminders. This is a beautiful app and I‚Äôm glad I gave it a try. | This app is trash‚Ä¶. I will not recommend. Go researxh another journal app. This app is not it. Before i renew my subscription, i will be deleting this app for sure. This year. | Nobody wants a subscription to everything. Typically you‚Äôd subscribe to something that gives you consistent new content and value. A lot of these apps expect you to subscribe just to keep using them, and I‚Äôd rather just not. | Selectable font/size. Auto sort by date. Easy typing, *most* markdown support. Slow but sure sync. Collapsible sidebar. Easy journaing, other tools. (E.g., images, reminders, etc.). I use it as my scratchpad too (separate folder from journal; a touch away). Run by Automattic: good folks. E2E encryption. (!important!) | I thought this was a journal just to write how you‚Äôre feeling. But realized I can use this as a common place book. Jotting down movie quotes I like, ideas that come to mind, clipping photos and art, siting life lessons or inspirational quotes, anything really. 

I love this. | Love the features and the design being simple and intuitive. 
It‚Äôs a savior for me. | I have been using this app since the first of the year on the recommendation of my brother. I recently got a shared journal too. However last week I was scammed and lost access to my Apple ID. The scammers locked me out of it. I had to get a new id. I wrote to the support email explaining the situation and got back a template email with links to their FAQs- and said they only give individual support to those who pay. You call that good customer service? I don‚Äôt. I won‚Äôt be using their app again. I heard from the developer but I am still not satisfied. In fact, I am very angry. Any link you provide to offer help is a link to the help page. Option 1 is the Help guides which are links to articles and tutorials. Option 2 is the DayOne forum, but In order to write to the forum you must have an account on Wordpress-something I don‚Äôt care to have- even if the first year is free. The only other option on the page is for premium users, of which I was one but cannot use it because I lost the use of my AppleID. As I said above, I won‚Äôt be back. I found another solution for my needs. Have a nice life! | Not happy | Will have let it lapse after a year of loving it. I am just too poor, living on social security. | Easy to use and fun so far.
A little glitchy at times. | I have been a Day one user since the early days when they were trying to get off of their feet. I became a plus user as a grandfather. Now the app is making me either log out and delete everything and re-login and upload everything or I have to delete the app and reinstall it for it to notice that I‚Äôm a plus user. I tried to write customer service but they told me I am not a premium user I am a free user so there‚Äôs not much help for me. I guess I will  have to download everything and just leave Day One. that‚Äôs the problem with putting your life online. If a company changes something then It could adversely affect you. | Love this app a great way for me to type out anything on my chest and helps me journal better and more | One Day is the best for journaling!  I love the fact that you can attach photos!  I was in a dark place in life and was told to journal my thoughts before bed each day but was too lazy actually write on paper ( True Statement üôÉ) BUT with One Day you can type out your thoughts and it‚Äôs faster, easier, on your device to ensure you don‚Äôt have to keep up with a journal, and it has helped me tremendously! | I had a very, very good run going several years ago. For some reason, my 144 days of diary entries disappeared one day, and I couldn‚Äôt do anything to restore them.

This broke a habit I had fought hard to pick up. I had brainstorming going on in some of those 144 entries‚Äîstory ideas I wanted to revisit and expand on. They‚Äôre long gone now, and I‚Äôm just now getting over the anger, frustration, and sadness of all my lost material.

That being said, I can‚Äôt rate this app less than three stars. It‚Äôs still a neat little app. | the version without premium is still very good | The latest update with the shared journal feature is fantastic! However, I've noticed a limitation that affects its usability for me. While I appreciate the ability for friends to comment on my journal entries, it would be immensely helpful if they could also co-edit them. Currently, they're only able to comment, leaving us to work on the journal separately rather than collaboratively. Adding the option for friends to edit entries would greatly enhance our ability to work on the journal together. Thank you for considering this feature addition! | I‚Äôve been a day one user for three years and it‚Äôs still the best app for the job. I love how easily it sinks across my devices. Your journal can be as complex or simple as you want. | Day one is the best journal app because you can add photos write about your day and after a year or so you can see your memories and you‚Äôll never forget them. It has an option if you want notifications or not and doesn‚Äôt just automatically send them to you. I can unwind my day before I go to sleep and it‚Äôs the best way to do that! It also improves your typing and grammar but you don‚Äôt even work at it, you just get on the habit over time. Overall you should get this app because it‚Äôs a helpful app that gets me to sleep every night and brings myself up looking at the good parts of my day. | Best journal out there.

I only want money for my data and information from now on, and it will not be cheap. | I was tryna cash it out to cash app but I don‚Äôt know how to so it was hard to use the app | Years ago the app was good. I used to use it often because you didn‚Äôt have to pay a subscription to get all of your miles. I travel for a living and it‚Äôs crazy to think I get awarded 20 miles for a 120 mile drive, and for a 7 mile drive I get 8 miles. This app is just trying to get your money at this point. They stopped caring about the users experience and instead went for the money grabbing route and it‚Äôs sad to see. They‚Äôre excuse is that you can purchase their subscription in order to get all of your benefits, but why do I have to now when I didn‚Äôt have to before. Stupid change and terrible app, only reason I‚Äôm still on here is just to spend the last of my miles. Also you can only purchase on gift card a month and the raffles are fake. Update: the response you have given has only made me not want your app more. What made your app bad was the fact you made it to where you have to have a subscription in order for the app to be worth it. The whole point of the app is to earn not spend. You have changed that whole premise and that‚Äôs your response to every single persons post is ‚Äúmiles+‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt used to exist and should‚Äôve never exist. Same thing as buying miles. At this point you have turned your app into a pay to win Minecraft server. | Overall it‚Äôs a good app but I‚Äôm super confused how to cash out because it doesn‚Äôt say anything on cashing out, I want to cash out my miles into my Apple Pay or cash app account? | I was told I would get actual money from this that I could put on my cash app for example from TikTok ADs. This is NOTA true. All you really get it pretty much a few weeks of a free trial of something but it so hard to get them just for that. You get one mile for every mile you travel but to get almost anything you need THOUSANDS. This is not worth it and you do NOT get like $60 a week like the ads say. Don‚Äôt download. | On one trip I drive 136 miles but only earn 34 miles, and on another trip I drive 34 miles and earn 36 miles???? Make it make sense!! | wont even let me sign up keeps saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a problem on our end‚Äù | The app used to be ok when it auto tracked your miles for you. Now they want to charge $50 annually for that. And they now also charge a ‚Äúmaintenance fee‚Äù by wiping out all your miles if you don‚Äôt log in for two months. I lost 60,000+ miles from my account from this, even though no notice was given of the change and no warning the miles would be taken away. Simply not worth it. | This app used to b much better before it started charging to get the full benefits. I usually always just rack miles up til I have enuf to enter in a raffle or 2. (With at least 250-300 entries) and  I've entered probably bout 300 or more an only one 1. I'll probably delete soon if I keep not winning a raffle after so many I have other apps like this anyway. | I just downloaded this app from an and I was on TikTok (people saying they were either sceptical or earning 100‚Äôs of dollars. ) seeing this app now, it‚Äôs just not worth it at all. Don‚Äôt waste your time unless you want a 3 dollar Amazon gift card for driving 7000 miles. NOT WORTH IT!!!! ‚òπÔ∏è | This app used to be good. And then the rewards got less, and less‚Ä¶.. and less. And now it costs double your points to even get a reward. Was a good app. Not worth it anymore. | It‚Äôs the number one battery drain, even when tracking is turned off. It used 20% of my battery usage when turned off. Even more than Google maps navigation. 

It‚Äôs payout requires at least 10k miles for $5. That‚Äôs almost a year of tracking for that. 

It used to just automatically give you the miles which is not horrible. But now with the update you need to go to the app and claim each trip so the miles are recorded. 

And also, now when you redeem for gift cards, its not straight forward, there‚Äôs one per hour, so you‚Äôre competing against others. You can redeem only 20k miles per month, that‚Äôs the limit. | I enjoy useing it getting miles for every trip I take I cash out few times with it getting gift cards that‚Äôs pretty much my miles points go to | Whenever I have my location services on, I never earn miles!  Whenever I take the trivia, the miles I earned for answering correctly are not added correctly; I earned 51 miles total & it only added 15! | This app used to be easy to navigate and earn miles.  I was always a Diamond user throughout the month.  Now it‚Äôs more difficult, limiting and just not as rewarding.  I get the ads but having to manually claim miles and only being able to claim a portion unless I upgrade is frustrating.  I‚Äôll keep for now, but not in my daily app rotation as it used to be.  Fingers crossed they‚Äôll roll back some changes and make the users happy‚Ä¶ | You have made it much harder to earn miles thru surveys, the points are much lower.  You keep changing the rules.  I paid to upgrade and now considering trashing the app.  You are probably a communist funded organization. | I‚Äôm getting tired of the teir requirements changing. I feel like they‚Äôve changed a lot here lately. Honestly, I don‚Äôt drive enough to make much off this app most of the time so realistically for me to stay diamond tier this month I‚Äôm going to have to travel out of town a lot or just give it up. I work two jobs with a roughly 13 mile commute from home to job #1, 5 miles to job #2 and then another 13 miles home and that‚Äôs 6 days out of the week. I‚Äôm probably just going to stay on the app long enough to spend the rest of my points and then delete it. **a miles+ member** | Love the daily trivia. I get most of the answers correctly. Doing the surveys everyday is worth spending a few minutes. | It‚Äôs not worth it. It use to be better before they changed it. It‚Äôs very difficult to accumulate points. In addition, it‚Äôs even more difficult to win prizes. | Hi this is a great app maybe add more charity‚Äôs weekly for people who want to donate to the causes | I have been using Miles for a number of years and traveled all over the US and Caribbean with no issues.  That is until now.  I was in the Bahamas last week and now the app just opens up the green Miles page and won‚Äôt go any further. So disappointing as I have lots of miles and was platinum.  I ah e tried everything I can think of and still cannot access the app. | Didn‚Äôt use it for several months as they now charge a yearly membership fee.

I logged back in, and 51,738 miles were removed. Now at zero balance. | After the latest update where you have to earn Miles to keep Diamond instead of spending them the app is a whole money grab. Gotta pay for auto mile claims instead of it being originally automatic. Unless you doing Uber or something this app isn‚Äôt worth it anymore. I‚Äôve never wrote a review on anything but for this I had to. üëãüèæ miles | I‚Äôve been on this app for years.At first it was wonderful. They added your miles, all could get gift cards and you could get really good deals. (I did have an incident they rectified when I won a bid and they actually gave my code to someone else‚Ä¶I should have known it was going downhill then) Now this app is trash. If you don‚Äôt choose to pay for their premium membership you‚Äôre treated like a 2nd class citizen. You have to manually add your miles or just lose them. You never have enough miles for gift cards and the offers are garbage. It‚Äôs just boring and terrible. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money on this app it‚Äôs not worth it. Uninstalling today !!!! | Great app fr | The average driver in my area drives 10,000 miles a year.  A generic fast food $5 gift card is 10,000 miles.  So if every mile I drove was counted, I could redeem one gift card a year.  But every trip isn‚Äôt counted.  Only 5 are counted.  Sure you can boost a trip a day and say what you are doing or whatever for extra miles but my God.  You make it difficult to want to use the app.

20K for a $5 amazon or PayPal card.  2 years of driving.  Completely asinine. | I have had this app for a while and it has just gone from ok to plain horrible. Was able to redeem for a couple of gift cards but they were already used. Support is a non existent . Now they want you to pay for a subscription which is the biggest joke of all time. You need 20k miles for a $5 Amazon gift card. LOL. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this garbage app. | I had 400k+ miles and as part of maintenance fees all of them were removed. 

Not fair. | I recently updated my phone to the IOS17 which is when my phone started to overheat and the battery would drain rapidly fast. At the time I didn‚Äôt know the issue, and no one else did either so I had to get a new phone. The new phone did the same thing. It turns out it was this app causing the issues. It was running constantly in the background and it didn‚Äôt even track my miles. After deleting the app, my phone is operating smoothly again. | You supply them all sorts of information and they provide you with rewards that are next to impossible to achieve and redeem. | I‚Äôve had this app for almost 2 years and for some reason I can‚Äôt claim any of the miles I earned from my trips I can only earn from surveys and I can‚Äôt even spend them because it keeps saying there‚Äôs and error on there end not happy at all. As I am a student with little income and depending on my trips and earned gift cards to get presents for the holidays I am beyond upset and disappointed with so many miles that feels like useless miles since the app won‚Äôt work right. | I‚Äôve had the app for a while, and when I first started, they had different denominations on gift cards that you could choose from and tracked your miles better. Now it doesn‚Äôt track them as accurately and they made it harder for you to actually redeem. I wish it would go back. | Now it's a subscription app and not worth anything to me.

I understand how it works.

It's not worth my time and I doubt worth it for most people.

When it was free and automatically tracked miles you had something that would actually be useful both for users and people looking for user information. | Miles used to be really good. It was 10,000 points for a five dollar Amazon gift card before until they decided to start changing things and make it 20,000 points for a five dollar Amazon gift card which I find is ridiculous so basically all my points I‚Äôve been keepingare pretty much worthless now and half the value. I don‚Äôt think this is right at all. | Had this app for a few years now and have not redeemed miles for anything. It‚Äôs ridicules they way miles are earned now. There is never anything good to redeem on unless you are in the app at the right time for a cheap gift card. The other stuff requires you to spend miles on some subscription based service that you keep spending for months to come. I think it‚Äôs just time to forfeit the miles earned and chalk it up as a loss. | It used to be a good app but the updates ruined the app , 20,000 miles for a $5 amazon or paypal giftcard it would take 3 months plus to get that. I used to be able to get it in 3 weeks before the updates | Draining my battery and over heating my phone. Horrible app now with the updates. | I actually have eight of these step recording apps that I use by refused to use Miles rewards because the interface is too complicated. You have to pay money like a subscription for the best features that I‚Äôm not doing that it‚Äôs just that‚Äôs just gonna cut into my overall profit margin, so not interested one star. | Uninstalling. Updates made this app garbage. | Takes forever to get enough miles to get anything. Sure, it‚Äôs not like I am doing a whole lot. So anything gotten shouldn‚Äôt be easy. But then you can try the shop tab to get miles through purchases, cool, until you spend money and you don‚Äôt get the miles. I would have never signed up for Sirius XM, effectively expanding the number of e-mails I have to delete and having a radio service that is nowhere near as good as the usual subscription service I pay for. At least the Audiobooks trial is decent. Though, most of what can be found there can just as easily be found on YouTube.
Oh well, it‚Äôs only 30,000 Miles. Just one less app I have to log into every day. | They recently changed the app so you have to cash in twice as many miles for gift cards, plus they did away with the lower cost cards so it‚Äôs definitely not worth paying the subscription on anymore. I went back to the free version. | Back then the app tracked and earned your miles for you now you have to go in app to earn your miles if you don‚Äôt want premium along with you can only claim 5 walks a day so if you stop like all humans have to it will add u til it‚Äôs past 5 and you can‚Äôt claim it so basically the app got worse just so it could get more money and with the excuse of ‚Äúearning more for claiming the miles‚Äù in app like we have a choice | I say it worth nothing means they will deduct 5000 miles monthly if you don‚Äôt open the app even though you‚Äôve allow the app to track your location all the time. If you are lucky you will get an $5 gift card by driving 10k miles, that‚Äôs normally 1 years miles for a normal driver. And if you are not lucky, after few months of not opening the app, they will take all the miles back, and you got nothing! 

Really disappointing with this app. Very very little return, and sometime even turn you down by charging you inactivity fee(not opening the app) of 5k miles per month. | This went from very good to just not worth the data anymore. The old miles app version was awesome until this change it to this version. Now your mileage is limited and they want you to pay to claim more trips. The rewards to claim gift card needed more mileage points, so with the battery consumption from having this app track your mileage and keeping it on will just wear your battery and end up spending to replace it is just not worth it anymore. Bring the old version and maybe I come back. But for now Im deleting this app version. | ‚ÄúGift cards will be available in 5 minutes‚Äù
Constantly refresh page just to cash out‚Ä¶
After 5 minutes, not getting any gift card, ‚Äú gift card will be available in 1 hour‚Äù LOL
this app has went downhill. Deleting | üëçüèªüëçüèª | App updates every few days.  Changes redemption rules and every other thing you can think of.  Never know what the new rule is going to be.  Changes value/cost of gift cards .  Virtually never available to get.  Ridiculously difficult to use with the same rules for more than2 days in a row.   Look at app revisions for the last 7 months.üôÑ | I love the miles app but now they wanted you to buy miles+ went we all started free when I got. I love it if they would allow you to buy iTunes gift cards with other gifts and not have to waited so long for the gifts in between gifts. I a lots of us are saving your money for other stuff | I had this app for about a year and it‚Äôs not worth it at all. I had all these miles but couldn‚Äôt use them for anything. The offers are not good and you can get the same offers from the merchant directly without needing to have miles. A sneaky app to just keep track and saving data on you. | The kind of time you have to spend driving to get a 1$ gift card is absurd. The app used to be decent before the update then it went down hill I lost up to 35,000 miles and now there‚Äôs a subscription.$$$$ Get out of here!!!!

I wish my club would go back to routes printed on paper. | It not very clear how to use. | Definitely frustrating to try and set up a trip | It would be nice to know how to navigate this app. It feels like something that could be useful, but I am having trouble figuring it out. | Sharing with the family doesn‚Äôt work | So EASY to use, we transfer files (trips) between our IPDADsthen we independently review

We can easily pull up old trips to find our good memories along with data like cost, distance, how long we stayed‚Ä¶.

Who could ask for anything more! | All the app does is display a map of your route. Pain to have to open computer to get more info when phone is always handy. No arrival or departure dates, no address of destination pin. Pretty much just a non functional picture. But the desktop part is great. | I like the idea but the map lacks detail‚Ä¶ one of the reasons I don‚Äôt like Apple Maps.  Wish it would interstate with Google maps. I find that Google maps has more detail not just major highways. | App is not intuitive, gave up trying after 5min | Hard to use | I paid so I can save my trip and it is telling me I can not save my file.  Also, it does not auto-populate the addresses. | To think about what point you want to go from another point where you want to begin.
This one like the three others I tried make you start from where you are and want to track you where you progress.
I am flying somewhere else then driving from there. No pin drop allowed without exact address or data downloaded from something else. Planning not allowed.
Want 5 stars? Dumb it down and allow me to be smart. Allow me to just put pins in cities and towns and pick my path and once complete compute the distances and let me decide how far I want to go and drop pins in hotels and campgrounds and places to eat. 
Collect what I want from me and then collate. 
Going to just go sit at google maps and print to pdf after I look it all up myself. | I spent four hours planning a trip, and when I came back to it, the stops were scrambled with regard to the order along the way.  Many were also missing, even though I added them using addresses, city, state, etc. | Miles, time, tolls, ...  Trying to plan a trip, but this version won‚Äôt specify details from one location to the next? | This app dose not have all roads, just main ones most county and state roads do not exist, this app is useless. I type in an address it goes to nearest town, with no roads.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | Not able to get support without joining google groups, then the support is mostly other users.

The app doesn‚Äôt recognize that I paid for it. So won‚Äôt save or route my trip, therefore useless to me. Apple App Store marks it paid for 
So bummed can‚Äôt get it to work | Tried to use the demos numerous times and kept crashing.

Contacted support and they said try a different browser-safari, no luck, Firefox, no luck, Chrome, no luck on either my iPhone or IPAD.

I‚Äôve tried to set up a password for the subscription I paid for- link doesn‚Äôt work.

I‚Äôm going to have to send an email to technical support just to cancel the subscription I signed up for. | Not user friendly! | After I bought the paid version, it works really well. The developer seems like he‚Äôs tired of hearing about how his free version doesn‚Äôt work. | Very difficult to figure out how to use. Haven‚Äôt programmed a trip yet?! | Can‚Äôt map a very common route | I was trying to figure out routes that can be taken driving across country and it‚Äôs not very good at explaining how the app works | It doesn‚Äôt know all zip codes when searching location by zip code only. And there is no option for crossing Houston except using the only toll road which is stupid, there are 100 ways to get across town without using that. Overall it‚Äôs a basic app | just downloaded this app and planning on deleting it right after this. it seems to do good things but not for free, the free version doesn‚Äôt save anything for you. basically if you want it buy the paid version | Why would an app ask you to review the second you download it ?

There response was feel free to hit the cancel button ??

Why ask for a review the second you download it | I haven‚Äôt the faintest idea of what this app does! | Deceptive way to force you to purchase. Should have allowed saving with few pins so that we can see how it works. Developer responses are just rude, lacks compassion to understand basic feedback | I‚Äôve spent a lot of time searching for a trip planner, this one is beyond my expectations.
The tutorial is just the get started guide.

I‚Äôm traveling full time in our 5th wheel trailer. I downloaded this app after starting this seasons trip. Many of the features available were not in the tutorial but in the sample, so don‚Äôt forget to check it out. 
When entering dates and times I found the travel time was added in the data. 

One of the best parts in this app is the ability to edit the errors easily.

Bottom line I‚Äôm loving it! | I downloaded the app for the elevation feature that is advertised but foe the life of me I can‚Äôt figure out how to access it. I wrote to ‚Äúsupport ‚Äú and all they did was refer me to the online help page which only says that the elevation chart is very handy but don‚Äôt show how to access it!
So far this app doesn‚Äôt appear to be what it claims. | Fails to advise you can‚Äôt save your trip unless you save. Bait and switch. | App doesn‚Äôt work. Help is non existent unless you join a google group, but the email address to join does not show in the directions. Created a .GPX on my computer (round trip from Ks to MA, with hotel, dates info). Tried opening file in RTP, brought in 25000 POI pins, didn‚Äôt recognize my route, no hotel info. Very dissatisfied. | Before you can even plan a trip, you have to buy the app unless you want unsaved edits. Total rip-off. | Nothing seems to work.

Can‚Äôt edit pin names 

Can‚Äôt share contacts | First let me say I‚Äôve been using computers for a very long time and I can generally figure things out pretty quickly using the trial and error approach.  Appreciated being able to try a free version before buying the full version.  So I started with trial and error and soon realized that wasn‚Äôt working for me.  No problem, I‚Äôll use the tutorial. Swiped through the examples and thought ‚Äúcool‚Äù this is easy. So, started a pretend trip, which should have been pretty easy. Home to 2 poi to home.  Got the home in.  Even got the first location in.  Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to add the second location because the + sign wouldn‚Äôt come up again.  Back to the tutorial.  Went through that again.  Started over.  Same issues.  Played with it for about an hour or so and finally decided to move on.  

I agree with the person who commented about Streets and Trips, not because I‚Äôm looking to go back to a pc but for its functions and ease of use.  The developers snarky comment to a helpful suggestion from a customer told me all I needed to know. | Not clear how to use it to plot a trip | This has the potential of being a great app, but as is, its mostly just frustrating. I have yet to figure out how to delete a pin once it‚Äôs placed without deleting the entire file and starting all over. 
There also does not appear to be a search function in HELP.  If there is and I‚Äôm missing it, that‚Äôs just more evidence of being non-user friendly.  The developers would do themselves a huge favor to study Microsoft Streets and Trips for useful features and intuitive user interface. | Have not had the pleasure but hope this review gets me to the down load | I don‚Äôt see why this is any more useful than maps. There are no features that allow you to set a destination and plan a multi-day roadtrip, by setting the destination and adding legs of the journey while looking at the entire route and seeing pois on the way. You have to know where you want to stop ahead of time and that can be mapped with google or safari maps. Or maybe you can do that but it isn‚Äôt user friendly then. | Have to purchase | I have been using this app for a couple of years now. 24 National Parks and counting. I pick an ultimate destination and edit stopping points along the way. I try not to drive more then 3 to 4 hours between stop overs. This allows me to see the routes and time travels. I can insert new POI/destinations and edit the pins to reroute accordingly. I am not to techie,so probably don‚Äôt get the most out of apps? But I believe that free apps are just that and no one makes stuff for free. Always room for improvement, but time cost money and programmers aren‚Äôt free. | You will waste more money by wasting time with this app. Not worth it | I have not downloaded the app yet but reading the comments from the developers responses is entertaining. Not very customer service friendly responsive.someone gave a good review but the app developer reply‚Äôs with instructions. I am gonna try this app but mainly because the app developer response is entertaining. Lol BTW the excuse that nothing can be done about how Apple maps work is not valid as you can as a developer use your own mapping tools you don‚Äôt have to piggy back off apples map app that is a choice. Just FYI

Update:
So trying out the app so far found many issues with it. Even though this is a basic free version it should give you the ideal how the app functions. As I am gonna try it first before buying the full version. When searching a spot it doesn‚Äôt actually go to where your search is just the general area. Also the search list shows a list of places that match the search which is good however it‚Äôs pointless if you can‚Äôt scroll down and look through that list. Other things wrong with it is it isn‚Äôt user friendly. I am a tech guy and know my way around an app. I can see how people will have issue using it. This is not the case to be blamed on Apple as this is your App and you control how well it functions 100% app developer. It also does not seem to have a feature to plan the trip in advance as I see no option to adjust the date | Crappy app | This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen! Way too difficult | Downloaded and before I can even start they let you know that none of your entries or changes will be saved unless you purchase the ‚Äúother app.‚Äù It‚Äôs a waste of time and a trap. I will buy another but not this one because it was initially misleading. Thanks but no thanks.

DON‚ÄôT WASTE YOUR TIME | Not user friendly at all. | This app is dumb!

Any time you want to look at something there is a 3-5s delay while an add is forced on you.  Easily the worst Ad experience with a free app.  Much easier to just have a shortcut to the website if AccuWeather is that important.  

Also‚Ä¶$4 per month to get rid of Ads?  That is insane.  Maybe a one time $4 fee, but $48 per year to not have ads on a weather app?  Who checks weather often enough to justify that?

I personally won‚Äôt use app or website just based on principle. | Weather prediction today is worse than it was 20 years ago! And now we have to watch ads to get inaccurate data?! What a joke, weather prediction is terrible! | Dark mode location search doesn‚Äôt work right.  Black text with a black background is hard to see. | Not the greatest you vacant change locations  otherwise it‚Äôs all right | I purchased Premium years ago, then it merged with standard ..no free for all with Ads.  Pay again?  No, I don't like feeling swindled and waiting for ads to load when I'm working in the field. Solid product but prefer features on other apps | I‚Äôve had this app for years. I‚Äôm pretty sure most of these weather apps pull from the same resources, so I don‚Äôt think there is really much I can comment on with regard to accuracy. The layout is intuitive, and it works for me. My only complaint, which must be recent, has to do with night (dark) mode - one of the display choices.  I‚Äôm unable to see the text when searching for locations when the app is in dark mode. The backgrounded is grey, but for some reason the font color turns black when I try to search for new locations. It‚Äôs literally impossible to see the names of the locations. I hope the developers are aware of the glitch, and fix it in the next update. | I have used Accuweather for several years now, and it has always been my favorite weather app. However I started having issues with it in early 2024. Have deleted and reinstalled it with no resolution. I really don‚Äôt want to find another app, but if I can‚Äôt figure out why it won‚Äôt work, I will have to find a new weather app. üò¢
Even with my location services on, it won‚Äôt find my location, and it won‚Äôt allow me to search for other areas, like where my son is in college.  Worked fine until the latest update. | Largely inaccurate like all the other apps. The radar is only a guess‚Äîit changes drastically as the current time approaches. Same for the forecast‚Äîtypically only good for the same day. After that it simply goes by historical average. | Ever since the last couple of updates, it seems to me that it takes longer to load than before. Has anyone else brought this up? | Minute cast says no rain for 120 minutes. It's storming like crazy currently. Fail. Update- once again the widget is just a blank white square. Uninstalled and installed back. Same issue. It‚Äôs upsetting to pay to be a ‚Äúpremium member‚Äù and this happens every other month. Advise getting a different app. | Used to be a good app. Now they keep locking features behind more layers of pay walls. Find something else that isn‚Äôt trying to take you for as much money as possible. | Easy and accurate | App stopped working a couple updates ago and now no longer finds new places. Useless | Where did the widget go? | My local weather reports no rain in the last 24 hours. Well, the city center was flooded with a foot deep problem last nite around 8pm. Your app took note and continued to give probability figures that appear exactly as are listed. I‚Äôll rely on this information. Thanks for your hard work in supplying info. 
One suggestion.  With the radical changes in weather patterns, it would be great to access an anual graph of conditions ( temp and rainfall) going back a few years. Just to observe any trends to anticipate. | Then you have to watch a commercial.  I‚Äôve used the app for over 10 years and it‚Äôs just gotten progressively worse.  The final straw was requiring me to view a commercial to see the hourly forecast.  Deleted the app right there and got a different weather app. | Do not depend on this app if you need to really know whether or not you will get 6‚Äù of snow or a trace. Do not depend on this app to tell you if it is really going to freeze hard or stay at 35F during the night. A weather rock is about as good- if it‚Äôs wet it‚Äôs raining. | Update-2 - 03/25/24. The app is still great, but I‚Äôve lowered my 5 star rating due to AccuWeather‚Äôs sharp pricing practices. Features previously included in the Premium package have been ever-so-slightly changed / ‚Äúimproved‚Äù, and then used to create a Premium-Plus pay level. AccuWeather‚Äôs statement that the information is still available in chart format is weak since AccuWeather‚Äôs graph format is so intuitively easy to read and comprehend, versus the chart format‚Äôs numbers and percentages only. Further, for anyone who has multiple devices on competing operating systems must pay double - even though registered under the same email address. Many apps are set up to allow pay-once, use on ‚Äúx‚Äù number of multiple devices. If you are new to AccuWeather, think long and hard before committing to pay for the service. Their sharp business practices will likely continue since they‚Äôve shown a proclivity of trying to wring more money out of existing users. UPDATE - 07/19/20. New interface - love it. Clean, intuitive, still information rich, and controls simplified to get you where you want quickly. Good job Accuweather. Team Now, don‚Äôt sell out to Weather Channel/IBM like so many others have. OLDER: I‚Äôve been a user of AccuWeather for several years, both the desktop version and the mobile versions (Android and iPhone) and it is brilliantly done. There is depth of information for the weather geek, simple to read and understand screens for the quick forecast, and much in between. Their Minute forecast for precipitation start/stop for the upcoming 120 minutes is spot on -- amazingly accurate for your exact location. Highly recommend it. | My other weather apps are now my go-to apps. | Worthless | Up to date information. Great features! | App is supposed to be getting better but as changes are made things are slowing down.  Now future radar seems to have disappeared. 

Given my complains, why would I subscribe? | The weather fluctuates so much with this app. The radar was the best out there until they started charging for future radar. | Can‚Äôt see forecast on radar. App is essentially worthless now. I‚Äôll go back to the Weather Channel. | Radar setting is set to ""BOTH"", so it should show PAST radar and FUTURE radar. The only thing it shows is the PAST up until NOW. No future radar since latest update. Used this app for years. Might be time to find another app if this is how it's going to be. | Looks like the last update removed the forward looking radar. I don‚Äôt care what already happened, I was there when it happened. I like seeing the forecasted radar but if you removed that, I‚Äôll go somewhere else. | For years this was my go-to app for weather. But one of the last updates took away future radar. What's the point in using this now? I want to know what's going to happen - not what's in the past. And a note to the developer: I would gladly pay for this app if it were a 1-time thing & not a subscription. | Seriously, my iPhone widgets are frequently broken. Their support says they know and just wait for another update. It‚Äôs ridiculous that whatever is in your program brakes whenever iOS makes an update. I‚Äôm not going to pay an additional $5 for it. | Search results aren't working. No matter what city I type in or zip code, it returns ""no results found"".

*update* This issue still hasn't resolved even after uninstalling / reinstalling, and waiting for an update that fixes or at least a response to the issue. I'm uninstalling the app and canceling my subscription. You should look at Windy as the model for community involvement. | I noticed the app no longer forecasts future radar unless premium is elected. I live in the Midwest and knowing where heavy weather is moving in from is extremely important. Tornados can be fatal.

Your organization is a greedy abomination, putting money above the safety of the average citizen. I‚Äùll find another weather app that is run by honest folks. Hope you go out of business. | Your radar now only goes up to the present time. It use to go to about an hour past, which showed where the weather was going to be in the future. What happened?

Thank you,
Mike King | This use to be a great app and I used it frequently, however, now you have decided that you want money in order to get a decent app that will let me know what the weather is. I noticed today now the reader doesn‚Äôt give me the future radar only the past. I will not pay you $4.00 dollars a month to get the weather when I can get it free on tv. I guess I will have to delete this app as I cannot afford to pay you in order to see what is happening in my neighborhood. | After update widget doesn‚Äôt work! | Slow to load, less than information unless you pay for premium, and ads. | If anybody likes full screen pop up ads when selecting options from the home page, this is the app for you. | I was just looking for a decent, free weather app. This wasn‚Äôt that! The app was set to the correct location and said ZERO chance of rain but my friend and I were being held hostage in a tack room while it poured rain and hailed! We‚Äôd just turned horses out and had to scramble to bring the now frantic animals back in. Uninstalled!!! | Your app is Jicky at best. Whenever I need to know what the weather is doing your Jicky app always freezes and places my family and my life in jeopardy. I have deleted your app and I hope that maybe somebody with your organization will fix it before you kill someone. | When I could just go online or get a different app that shows me the same stuff + surf for free | I think it‚Äôs disgusting how much you raised the price of this app. Absolute corporate greed. So disgusted that I‚Äôm deleting the app off my phone. | AccuWeather would be my go-to app because it is much more accurate than Apple's Weather app, but it doesn't work with my Apple Watch.  I can't imagine why! | I like this app, been using it for years now. | I used to love your AccuWeather App! Then you changed the hourly forecast to a line graph! | Updates to an app or its navigation dynamics are usually helpful.  The recent revisions to your app have made me go searching for an app easier to use.  Disappointing. | Not sure what is up with this app, but it‚Äôs worse than the weatherman lately.

This happens using either an iPhone 13 or 2022 iPad Pro running iOS/iPadOS 17.4.1. Called Tech Support and they could not resolve the issue. | It is a good app but when I the app is down it is a living nightmare | App worked fine until recent update. Now it will not load unless you update to an IOS version that is not even compatible with phones purchased only a few years ago. A simple app like this should not have such requirements. | Most of the stuff on T-Mobile Tuesdays is just coupons and free trials‚Äîboth of which are designed to get you to spend money, not save money.  On the rare occasion that there is an actual freebie available at the T-Mobile store, they will often run out of stock by the time you get there. | I shouldn‚Äôt have to consign my iPhone 7 to a landfill just to get free MLB TV. I can‚Äôt believe this app needs to be so sophisticated that there cannot be a legacy version that will work on older devices. | Can‚Äôt sign in to the new t mobile life app, since it came out.
The keyboard always freezes before I finish my password.
I have deleted the app and reinstalled the t mobile life app back, only to have the same issue again and again.
I can‚Äôt be the only person who has this issue.
Please fix this issue. | I have 2 lines on my phone. This morning, I was trying to log out of one number so that I could use the second number for another code - there is no option anywhere in this app to log out and log in with a new number. I ended up having to log out, uninstall the app, turn one phone number off, reboot my phone, reinstall the app, and it finally recognized my second number. It would have been 5 minutes not wasted if I could have just logged out and back in. | How is it the a new app is released and the scrolling is as bad as it is on any phone. 
Simple scrolling shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. | T-Mobile has awesome customer support when you call in they have taken excellent care of me and my concerns.
Thank you T-Mobile | Please fix the lagging when it comes to scrolling through the app. | Absolutely HATE the new change. I have the internet for work and now I can‚Äôt access the Rt life because I had to register it as a business account. With the old version, I was able to have access. This is dumb. Go back to the old ways | Not sure what happened to this app. It ran great before but now the performance is awful | It‚Äôs nice seeing that your vendors are offering Different Promotions monthly. | Free stuff | This app is not letting me install it on my Samsung phone and on my iPhone I am not able to see the perks. | Would love more vegan options | This app runs slow and laggy now. There‚Äôs also rarely any good deals for consumers. It‚Äôs primarily just marketing and promos for partner companies to encourage customers to spend more money. | Not worth having the notifications on. | Super glitchy, kinda like they don‚Äôt have any app QC | I rarely found anything that was worthwhile enough for me to want to take advantage of when it was T-Mobile Tuesdays; but yet I‚Äôm still baited by the enticing notifications to say least check out the details.  That is, if I could.  Since it‚Äôs switched over to the new app I can‚Äôt even get in.  Trying to access on iPad b/c my dinosaur iPhone SE (that I love) is too old to update to the iOS version required.  On my iPad, I can‚Äôt log in - it just freezes when I use Touch ID for my T-Mobile log in.  It‚Äôs absolutely worthless if you can‚Äôt even open it. | I can‚Äôt download this app. | Proud customer:) | This app has no value.  The freebies they give are freebies advertised from the partners directly.

This last week you could get a free mini blizzard from DQ.  But if you downloaded the DQ app organically, you would see it was available to all people not just T-Mobile exclusives.

The hotel and other perks also seems to be way more expensive than Expedia or other travel sites.  Save space on your phone and don‚Äôt down load this app. | Did not have any Dairy Queen that supported the ‚Äúreward.‚Äù | Sometimes I wish there was more that I could use. But I love the food and picture making offers. | I love that new update this app | Love the perks I get with T-Mobile. I have been a T-mobile/sprint customer for 23 years and I have never been disappointed. | This is the third week in a row I‚Äôve tried to open the app and get Tuesday deals, but the deals don‚Äôt load. Every other page on the app works, but when I go to the deals page it says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a glitch in the system. Please check back later.‚Äù It‚Äôs been 3 WEEKS. Please get this fixed or I don‚Äôt see the purpose of using the app. Also, every time I open the app it asks me to sign in and it won‚Äôt let me use Face ID. I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on all the deals I‚Äôm supposed to get :( | There no notification anywhere in the app. | Lit | I no longer get notifications from this app on Tuesdays‚Ä¶. Why??? | The app was a lot better before the magenta status stuff. Not even worth it for me to look on Tuesdays anymore. Might as well of just said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt pay, you don‚Äôt get the same perks as before‚Äù because that‚Äôs really what the new update did. | Doesn‚Äôt support an older iPhone.  Need v16. | I love everything | Cannot access. Cannot update this device because of security clearance | I like Tuesday app better because it was easy to know what to save and redeem but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get the hang of it soon | This was great back when it was sprint. I got things all the time that were usable. Now it just feels like constant garbage or constant stipulations to use anything. It also doesn‚Äôt help that they want me to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù plans to get some of the free stuff but their new plans cost more and give me less than I have now. There is a reason people often stay grandfathered on cheap plans for long as possible. | All the offers aren‚Äôt even worth it anymore. All that money and they can‚Äôt even try to give us good offers. Like I don‚Äôt want to go to Lego land. Do I look 10? | Good but DiningAdvantage deals do not work; restaurants will not accept them. | Might have to switch over | Why can‚Äôt I open the app? It says I need 16.0 or up update but I‚Äôm on 17.5 ? | With the introduction of ‚ÄúLife‚Äù, support for perfectly fine, working iPhones and iPads running 15.x has dropped. This includes pretty much all Apple iProducts since 2019. Just 5 (five) years ago.

It‚Äôs either a ploy by t-Mobile to increase revenue or the result of programmers who lack the ability/work ethic to maintain working code. | Latest updates broke the app, glitches and won‚Äôt load, totally unusable. The previous Tuesdays app worked great, why they heck did you change it? | But this is false.

App is mostly a waste of time. | The Tuesdays section hasn‚Äôt worked since the launch of this app. | I don‚Äôt understand the point of this new app, bring back t-mobile Tuesdays | This app, and apparently all other T-Mobile apps, are either new or have been recently upgraded, and they will not work with anything earlier than iOS 16.0. So, if you‚Äôre using an older model iPad or phone, you are out of luck. The older apps will not work, and you‚Äôll get instructions to upgrade. However, when you download the newer version, you‚Äôll repeatedly be instructed to download the app again. It‚Äôs hard to believe that no one at T-Mobile thought about this before abandoning the earlier versions of the apps, which had been working just fine. | Used to work great before it became t-life. Now it‚Äôs nothing but problems.",4.78146,436715,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b4/f1/b7/b4f1b752-c4e8-5673-fc81-45ee1247b7e5/92e3c6e9-f7d4-4857-8ff8-d899d7d4bf2d_5.5_Screen_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7c/5c/91/7c5c915f-0e7b-72ee-eefa-b46973c1e950/bddc9c54-a768-4213-b58d-5d29e3adbccd_5.5_Screen_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a0/c8/d4/a0c8d4c1-8040-dbd5-a39a-93e5785294ab/c4dd0e7a-e245-4c13-b04c-7e70765daadb_5.5_Screen_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/61/b5/65/61b5652d-1dc3-11d2-75a4-f4258e1db345/4a23123b-7642-488c-9f3e-144497e8e79f_5.5_Screen_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/24/e6/d2/24e6d281-1a92-50e1-f934-dbc569894551/959616d9-6b33-412d-9c79-846f0f6fd323_5.5_Screen_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b6/81/3f/b6813f80-fae1-e412-1774-7ee145a4d2f9/ee67363a-1c4b-445a-9774-a30cdbfa650d_5.5_Screen_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Switch to Avis from enterprise and might be switching back. Brutal app | No way to reach customer service in app | I have to make at least 3 reservations each time I reserve a car on this site and am always terrified that I have and will pay 3 times. It could just be me but I don't think so. 
The other complaint about the site is the complicated rate details. I already have the LCW checked in my profile but before checkout, the site always says...your car is not covered..so do you click it AGAIN? Difficult so I use this site if cars are not available elsewhere. | The app, when you click ‚Äúget directions‚Äù, takes you to the wrong location. It‚Äôs an old Avis location that is currently a condo building under construction. It caused me to be late for my return since it took me 30 minutes out of the way and Avis charged me for an extra day. Tried disputing, but no manager was available to discuss on a Wednesday midday. Unacceptable! | It has been quite a problem ,my wizard number and password was not recognised by Avis for an unknown reason reset requests has been unsuccessful as Avis promised to send emails which was not received | I had just boarded my DC-area flight to MCO when my app popped up that my rental was ready.  I was assigned a pickup truck, which didn‚Äôt suit my needs or match my reservation request‚Ä¶ the app was behaving as if I had already begun my reservation.  No option to change vehicle, which when you go to FAQs is the only instruction‚Ä¶ a button under the vehicle that you can click to change or you can choose to confirm‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt click confirm but the app apparently selected for me, which required a long wait on hold to connect to someone that told me I can wait in line at the counter when we arrived to request a new car‚Ä¶ | I and my co workers all feel the same way, tye Avis app is one of the worst. Certainly time to update it and make it user friendly! I hate when I need to use it. | Never seems to work when you need it | I‚Äôve been traveling pretty much for more than 30 years and getting rental cars local and internationally. This is the first time I have issues with Avis. The system hasn‚Äôt updated my rental returned car since 2 days ago. But not also that, I pre-paid and now the APP is saying my estimate is twice as much of what I paid for already. Also if I use my PC and login it says the rental has been closed, but it doesn‚Äôt show the amount charged and the rental as a past rental at all. 
This is very concerning!!! | Awful experience | Unsatisfactory car choices for Presidents Club member. | Choice of cars limited
Cars dirty | Was forced to take an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù which was not. | CANT ADD AWD NUMBER
CANT ADD DISCOUNT CODE

WHAT GOOD IS IT? | Avis in San Juan didn‚Äôt understand the concept of service. Being a Preferred member for more than  15 years , this is the worst location ever. 
The representative at the counter didnt have good manners. 
No one at the exit gate , waiting for 25 minutes to get out. 

Horrible experience‚Ä¶. | Most horrible Avis I went too! I will never spend my money or credit card. A waste of my time and money. Mostly due to the fact that they didn‚Äôt want to run my credit. | Just a horrible company with deceptive business practices. I gave them a chance to avoid losing my ongoing business and customer service basically gave me the middle finger. 

I rent a dozen times a year for work and I‚Äôll be switching to literally any other company. | Hey, this is without a doubt one of the most poorly run companies that I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of working with. Their app constantly fails, leaving their users, high and dry when you go in to actually talk to a human being. Generally, they are incredibly unhelpful. I‚Äôm gonna start using other rental companies. | If you book Avis thru a travel agent, Avis will associate the email address you've given the travel agent with the agents themselves.  And so if at a later time you try to create an acct of your own with Avis,  you will not be able to do si using the same email address.  Avis doesn't tell you this; instead of informing you you cannot use the email address, its website and app let you ""register,"" only to leave you hanging because their own system reroutes emails to your travel agent.   The app/most of the Avis reps won't tell you this as you navigate the app/speak with them online/on the phone.   You will not be able to access any Avis reward points/frequent traveler program, etc. unless you provide them with a second email.  You're told they've sent you a ""confirmation email,"" when in fact they have not (they *cannot*, because in thier database your email address is tied to the travel agent).  Luckily the last rep I spoke with explained all this to me. | So easy and convenient. Never had wrong vehicle or mistaken situation | They love to raise the price over $50.00 in just matters of hours apart of looking to booking | Doesn‚Äôt update the app with my current rentals. Consistently have to locate confirmation numbers then locate. | Horrible horrible 

LONG LONG LINES UNDER STAFFED

Terrible attitudes 

WHY WHY am I in the f line 

When I have Prefferres wizrd ?!!!! | Terrible service. Always erroneous charges on my bill. I have been using them once a month out of convenience but being that they don‚Äôt care about their customers I definitely should take my business elsewhere. | I used Avis for the first time and the experience was horrible, first I returned the car with full gas tank and they charged me $26.30 saying the tank was not full, I contacted them and they gave me a coupon. After that they charged my Credit card for $30 saying the E-Toll charges however the toll amount is not more than $15.xx bcz I travel frequently in my own car on the same route and now got a call from them and they are claiming that I damaged the car while the car was already damaged when I picked it up from pickup location it was snowing and the wind was so bad that day I didn‚Äôt make the video of the car just hopped in and took the car and now they are saying that at the drop off we saw on cameras that the car was damaged but they cannot see the pickup location cameras WTH is this. | It‚Äôs pretty annoying how the app defaults to specific times for arrival and return and how your desk folks adhere to those times as if written in stone. Travel can be unpredictable and more flexibility in the app without additional charges would go far to increase the customer service experience. It‚Äôs why I choose enterprise over Avis every time I can. | I‚Äôm trying to create an account, but I cannot. I continue receiving the same, non-descript message that is not at all helpful in indicating WHY the account can‚Äôt be created at this time. Very frustrating‚Ä¶ | üöòüöÉüöòüöò | I have been trying to create a wizard number | Why have an app with no way to communicate? I know how to use phone to call already. | I would not recommend anyone to use Avis or Budget for Uber Rentals. They will charge you double and triple the amount for one week claiming it's processing. Meanwhile your funds are removed from your account due to their lack of professionalism. Customer service will request you to send them pictures of your bank account showing the funds were taken and it will take Jp to two weeks if you get reimbursed while two days later they are taking more money out. Terrible company, no manager is never available only foreigners working from home | I need to update my card but there is no path to do that. | I rented a Tesla instead of the mustang cause I know that‚Äôs what charger the hotel I‚Äôm staying at has I asked the guy at the desk if they have the adapter he said no try some other location and a app to find a charger but then I‚Äôd have to pay to charge. I said this is why I asked for a teslas and he just proceeded to tell me it‚Äôs the same class which it isn‚Äôt on the site and hung up on me. I have had nothing but problems with Avis for a while and I promise this will be my last time. | Does not maintain up to date info on upcoming trips. Have to keep putting in confirmation number. | The company promises one thing, but plays games by telling customers they will document the situation and what will be provided, but the agent will not document it.  Therefore company can say since it‚Äôs not documented they will not honor what they said they would provide. Very unprofessional way to do business and to trick your customers. 

Don‚Äôt be fooled. The company only serves themselves. Dishonest business. | I | If you use app after week or month never able to use it even with correct password. You try reset that page never show complete it always says error and if it go through some how you never received email. You end up calling the 800 number you have to Google it to find it. 
Who designed this app probably never used it. 
Asking for nicknames and I tried 20 and non work so I can‚Äôt send this review wow what a system | Love the app! | Keep getting ‚Äúmaximum code sends‚Äù message. I reset password more than dozen times. Spend more than an hour with customer service, hopping between 4 different people. Last person (seemed to be a real technical support?) told me they don‚Äôt have support for this app - just support website. Wouldn‚Äôt have gone through this pain if I was not looking to skip the counter at the airport. Apparently you can skip the counter with website? | App continues to try to reset password but I can login just fine online. Can‚Äôt get anyone on the phone in customer service. | Can‚Äôt press return rental always says ‚Äúrefresh gps‚Äù then when you do the same window comes up. 

Then can‚Äôt modify the return either | NOT user friendly at all, it won‚Äôt remember reservation after entering in app! | First of all this App has some pretty cool features like choose your own car at pickup location and walk to you assigned car without talking to a human.

However I cannot believe it does not let you setup a business profile separate from your personal profile.  Come on Avis it‚Äôs 2024.  People travel for both business and vacation.  If it‚Äôs business, it should be billed to the company credit card.  If it‚Äôs for vacation, it should be billed to the personal credit card.

To make this worse, you does not allowed change of method of payment if it‚Äôs prepaid.  I prepaid with my personal card for vacation but when I arrived at the pickup location it changed to the last card I used which was a business credit card.  Please fix this issue or learn from Uber/Lyft. | Not responsive.  Does not allow easy change of credit card in profile.  Does not allow logout | I love the ease of the app! Everything is easy to maneuver best thing they could have done. | Too many steps to modify a change of time in app.  Why would you want to reselect your car before confirming a time change??? | Doesn‚Äôt show my current reservation no matter how many times I add it. | Trying to add a new credit card. Online gets rejected and no way to even do it on the app

Need to use National | ‚Ä¶and I still need to go to a window as it‚Äôs not ready. Great work | I have recently switched my car rental business from a competitor to Avis. I couldn‚Äôt be more happy. The staff at the Warsaw Indiana location is absolutely amazing. They have been so helpful. The cars are always so nice and clean.",4.69686,271952,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/26/aa/59/26aa5972-dc4e-9bd8-a24a-ea58221d9ee8/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/0e/23/3f/0e233f68-0579-e870-3d81-911677508133/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/d9/d6/3b/d9d63bf1-d9aa-e95a-812d-0ef6e96a463b/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/a0/36/1d/a0361d87-72e2-5900-b40a-c80d4f795308/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/e5/1b/02/e51b026c-68e3-c02f-c59c-c6fa32605c28/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I liked that everyone in my group was available through chat, but it felt nickel-and-dime to have to pay to send them basic messages when there were no other viable wifi options, especially at final debarkation. Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have minded paying if the others could have installed the app 
. | The time stamp didn‚Äôt match my phone or the ship time.  This made it confusing to know when I got a message.  I got horrible wifi in my stateroom so it didn‚Äôt work half the time.  It didn‚Äôt always notify me or my family when we got a message.  It was ok, but this app needs work.  It isn‚Äôt reliable. | Disappointed that we have to pay to use the chat mode but having the daily schedule at young fingertips is great. Also using it to check in for dinner is super easy. | A few minor changes I would say it would be nice to see the Navigator map of the ship on the app and be able to see/book your next cruise on the app! All else üëç! | w app | We had an interior cabin on the 8th deck and the app would hardly ever work until we stepped into the hallway. Also, even though we attended the muster station right away, the reminder banner to do so remained on the app the entire cruise. Third, when you click ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening now‚Äù it will show you events that are two or three hours(or more) past. I would think it would be easy to keep that info in line with the current time. I do like reserving dinner table and planning my day. | Loved it!!!! | Because it did not work very well inside the cabin, even with premium wifi! | Overall fantastic and so easy, so helpful. On the last day of the cruise, we lost the chat function (went down for everyone) and I missed connecting with some people, as well as limited my abilities to connect with my kids. But overall, fantastic. | App was helpful but most of the time couldn‚Äôt view my onboard expenditures! 
Helpful in viewing dinner menu! Also good for viewing daily schedule options! | Can‚Äôt complain it did it‚Äôs intended purpose in the end | So cool! | I loved using the app to know what was available on the ship. Didn‚Äôt get 5 stars because the onboard WiFi connection would not stay connected. | No problem with the app, was able to use it throughout the time on the ship with no issues! | Outside of a few times it froze up, and I mean a few out of the seven days and having it on constantly for the whole cruise, I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Worked as good as my first cruise back in 2018. We will see how it works my next one. | The app was great for finding events to go to, when you have a group, and if you want to do something you could like it and then the people in the group would know what you were interested in doing. We used it several times and have any problems with it highly recommend using the app if you have a group. | The only reason this got two instead of one is because i liked how you can talk to your friends and family. Everything else sucked completely. Chats got deleted, no notifications were sent, and overall it was just bad | It will not let me upload a pic and the texting on the ships is horrible | I was able to text my family without having a signal due to having my airplane mode on . So it was very convenient only 5$ for the duration of the cruise so most def worth it . You could book excursions, sees photos in that whats happening section of different guests i love seeing the photos they took ! ‚ù§Ô∏è | The app while onboard actually worked pretty good. As long as the wifi wasn‚Äôt down on the boat, which seemed to come and go. But definitely worth the $5 a person. And loved being able to look up events and food while onboard. | The Carnival APP is great to reach out to family onboard & to remind u of upcoming events in ‚ÄúMy Planner.‚Äù  Only negative is the wi-fi included tends to disconnect often & you need to select it each time to reconnect.  Otherwise it was convenient to keep track of events or appointments you are interested in during your cruise! | Your staff did an excellent job,especially ( Marlito) who did an excellent job keeping our room clean and tidy.
But your buffet was terrible! We did not enjoy the buffet food at all. | The Hub APP is great on board. Easy to navigate and use while aboard. And though I love the app it‚Äôs unfortunately only available on board. Would be nice to have it available prior to plan our week. Can‚Äôt wait to Cruise again!! | Carnival is by far the best for the money‚Ä¶..
Great service, food, entertainment‚Ä¶.
No one could reasonably ask for more for the same price‚Ä¶. | G8KT47

I was aboard the carnival freedom 3/21-3/25. Firstly I had the worst server in the dining room who literally rolled her eyes at me when I was asking about food options for my 10 month old daughter.  So I complained to the person in charge in the dining room and he said he would handle it and get us a different table for the next night well then I guess that server was reprimanded and then proceeded to ask me about the issues and make things very awkward for my family and myself.  

Secondly the food options other than the man dining room for dinner were limited.  Everything closed around 3ish everyday and didn‚Äôt open again accept the buffet.  

Then on Saturday my family was napping and we get notified that the ship is on fire and that we aren‚Äôt allowed to go on the decks and we‚Äôre pretty much actually locked in bc all the fire doors were shut.  People had life vests on it was terrifying for my children and us. 

After this experience there were no food places opened until late. And the remainder of the trip the entire back of the ship was closed including the track the basket ball hoops the mini golf annd  adults only pool and hot tubs. 

Proceed to Sunday trying to make the best of the trip and none of the arcade ticket machines were working and it took over 3 hours to get someone to help us get the machine fixed so my daughter could get her prizes.  

Then all of the shops and candy place was closed all day Sunday and never even opened so you couldn‚Äôt buy anything.  

. We should be compensated it‚Äôs absolutely insane our entire trip was ruined. | It was very helpful but also very glitchy. | In past cruises as recent as last mont you could put photo on your share countdown, gives you the option still‚Ä¶ but doesn‚Äôt work. | The app works great when the WIFI is working on the ship, however i don‚Äôt like that for certain aspects of managing my booking im required to login into the online interface to make changes/updates. 

I also notice delayed messages when on the ship, however that can also be attributed to poor wifi connections. | Kept logging off, maybe the WiFi. Made me miss a couple of messages and unable to access updated account information. | We loved the app and it was very easy to use and navigate. We paid $5 / person to text for the entire trip using the Carnival WiFi and it was worth every penny. Occasionally, it would not work (the chat - reconnecting), but would be less than 30 seconds before it was back. The app was great also when we weren‚Äôt able to go to our port bc of weather and new activities were added. It was also easy to use for disembarkation. It also has all your updated and current charges as you go along the trip- no surprises! Download it before you go! | This is a great and informative application that 100% accurate. | My cruise was enjoyable. I had a lot of fun. The only thing that was troubling was except for the fire,  
disembarking was horrific. Everybody wanted to go at the same time, and it really did not work. It took way too long to disembark and the elevator system didn‚Äôt work, and the notification system did not work because everybody was able to leave at whatever time they wanted to, and they created such a crowd on the stairwell because this elevator system was not good at all. so many people had to carry down their luggage people with canes people that couldn‚Äôt walk well all carrying their luggage down because they waited over a half hour for elevators that  every time they stopped, they were full so somehow that system of this embark, has to get better. I have been on several carnivals cruises, and this one was the worst 
 other than that I love cruising with carnival. | It was my first cruise and I vote the vista just a recommendation.The hub made it so easy to give us information that we needed I loved it so much,please I think the vista is the BEST! Btw marti i think that‚Äôs how you spell his name he was very entertaining 5/5 stars ‚ú® | Good üëç | My son and daughter in law took me on my first cruise. We just got back today and we were on the ship freedom that caught fire. I was impressed with how we were kept  informed on the situation with notifications every little bit. The food was wonderful the only things I would change is have soda more available for people that don‚Äôt drink anything but soda, and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have Coke products üò¨
The staff was spectacular no matter what the situation from cruise director all the way to bartenders and housekeeping. I would love to take another cruise and spend more time on your ships. | Love the app. Very user friendly and has all the information you‚Äôll need. | Loved the app to keep up with entertainment and knowing what food/bars were open! Wish the chat would have continued to work better for us. Would have loved to see the entertainment options further ahead of time to start figuring out what to do. Thanks for continuing to use this feature to make the ship times easier! | First time cruiser, (or for more than just a day cruise) and had watched a YouTube video that said that this was very beneficial and helpful to use. They were right. I didn‚Äôt invest in the paid Wi-Fi package and really didn‚Äôt need to, as the app worked without it. I was able to make reservations, check out things to do, look at menu‚Äôs and times which bars/ restaurants were open. Such a helpful app! | Worked okay but I kept getting kicked off. When it was working it was conveyor be able to keep in touch with others in our party | I would love the app if you locate your group members. To find out where they are. | Would have given more stars but the chat didn‚Äôt work half the time. | Helpful info on there too! | My wife and I were on the Carnival Breeze and had a great time ! Met some great people and made some more friends! Every time we go on a Carnival cruise we always make new friends and being kind and warm to other people is what we are supposed to do and the cruises are a wonderful place to do so! I love talking to people and seeing where everyone is from ! Didn‚Äôt have one negative experience on the cruise! Awesome! | Paid $5 for the chat and it didn‚Äôt work most of the time. | Enjoyed the trip even though it rained.  You all did your best!  Rooms and employees as well as the food was great.  Keep up the great job | The app was extremely helpful and loved using the my planner.  It sent reminders of all events that I chose. | The app is great for its purpose and price, I use the messaging where it gives me access to communicate with the people in my party. 
I wish there is a map showing where we are in the direction the ship is heading to.

And would be better if there‚Äôs an option to be able to place room service order through the app. Tried so many times to call through room phone and no one answered, and the only midnight snack bar is very full/ super long line. | Would be great if it did not kick you off all the time | It was great but I didn‚Äôt like that we couldn‚Äôt pay our bill on the app!

Their help center is horrific and unhelpful. | I‚Äôm a grab premium member. For some reason after a completed ride the app decided I owe an outstanding amount of 30 Indonesian rupiah, which is less than 2 tenths of a US cent. That‚Äôs right, 0.0019 USD.  The payment for the rest of the ride, for 75,000 rupiah or roughly $5, went through fine. 

I have tried numerous times over multiple hours, and it declines to use my card saying ‚Äúpayment unsuccessful, try again later‚Äù. 

As a result of this, I can‚Äôt order rides or food.

Of course, customer service promises to take 4-7 days to respond, with no chat functionality in the app. 

All for $0.0019. 

What a joke. | I‚Äôve recently came across an inconvenient bug. I called a grab car and accepted the ride via my credit card. Upon exiting the vehicle the driver asked for cash. I was unaware, and confused why he was asking me this. 

Apparently my card was blocked by grab, and there‚Äôs a bug saying I have an outstanding amount. My partner has a similar bug on her account.

I had luckily 100k of cash on hand to pay the guy, and gave my partner some cash to pay her driver. However this is annoyance, and unsafe bug.

Please fix! | Too many advertisements in the Thai language flood the foreign user.   It can be overwhelming.  

With much patience, one can find his ride choice.   Must be careful as the software leads the user to the most expensive choose.

Would have been a 5 if not for the above | When I first tried to sign up it shows you‚Äôve tried too many times even though it is first time. It still shows this bug. App doesn‚Äôt let to do anything without signing up. | He was very helpful. He carried out luggage inside and out the car. | All my cards amex, visa, master and even paypal were not accepted also wasn‚Äôt functioning right | Friendly and polite driver. | This is the first time we used the service in Singapore. We waited for almost 5 minutes and the car came online after 3 other cars. Then when she saw that we had 4 pcs of luggage she explained that we need to pay more for extra luggages. Now you charged us $20 more for luggages AND $5 for waiting.

Keep up the good work | He‚Äôs a great driver, and tells about Singapore as he drives. Very comfortable car and great experience. | Premium cars are default every time. Also, in the new feature of adding other car types to the booking, Premium has to be unchecked. Super inconvenient to do this every time | The driver arrived on time was prompt , cheerful and a good driver | I got text today that on my next ride I will get credit of 60 bath but I didn‚Äôt get it.  
Can you check and apply that credit?
I am also going to hire grab tomorrow for airport. 
Thanks | No matter how jam or buzy the driver never gives up on finding with patience and professionalism 

We are satisfied | I‚Äôve tried to get this app in multiple countries and continue to get the same error. It‚Äôs very frustrating. Could never get it to work deleted and reinstall the app. | I never take SUV or Premium, yet every time I go to book a ride, or add additional car options to call after the initial request, I have SUV or Premium options selected or prioritized, and it is a poor user experience to force these on people who never use them. It ends up occasionally resulting in me calling for the wrong car type, and I think the UX should be in line with Uber here and respect the default customer preference. | Easy pick up from the airport and great driving experience on a busy Friday night. | Th√¢n thi·ªán , nhi·ªát t√¨nh ,ƒë√†ng ho√†ng | I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt even get in touch with a real agent now.

If they don‚Äôt like you, they will blame you, charge you and block you! And it‚Äôs you‚Äôre fault they don‚Äôt deliver. Grab is great at promising and blaming customers when they refuse to deliver! | Very rude and strange driver for order A-65XBQ35GWJGI. Then I realize there is no way to report that in the application, neither can I rate the driver because of cancelation. | As much as the service provides a benefit, it is much manipulated and when a car is supposed to arrive in five minutes and 10 minutes later, they tell you that if it‚Äôs not there in another 10 minutes you will get a discount what‚Äôs the point? | App was great and easy to navigate | Very respectful and safe driving thank you. | Terrible customer service. Chatbot not useful and gives very limited options. Agents super slow to respond and not actually helping.

They desperately need to step up their game. | Very clean car and good driver | In Manila, we used Grab 3 times since the rest of the transportation our hotel gave us rides. So far amazing!!! Our third ride the guy was so kind!! Grab is awesome! | Nhanh v√† r·∫ª. T√¥i th√≠ch

Easy to use ‚Ä¶ | Very helpful app for everyone. | Driver just marked me as picked up, then took three loops of the airport visibly taking the wrong turn on the map, then drop to his next pickup while charging me. All the while Grab locked me from canceling, changing destination or getting a new car during a time sensitive situation | They will charge you for a ride that never even happened multiple times we called that fraud and multiple countries but I guess in Third World countries you can get away with that | Be Careful -

It makes shopping more fun and you get bonus points to go towards gift cards and benefits. What an awesome app; everybody should try it! | The app works most of the time. McDonald‚Äôs has problems and will not let me post receipts. I am frequently given the loading screen after pressing submit receipt only for it to go back to the receipt photo I just submitted on an endless loop. Needless to say, I‚Äôll be eating elsewhere. Hope McDonald‚Äôs gets on top of that. | Updated review. The developer sent a response with a link that I can use to report missing cash back - not mentioned anywhere in my original review. There is a buried link on down their page that gives the same instructions I‚Äôve been following to try to get logged back in‚Ä¶ changing the password. I‚Äôve literally done that process a dozen times and still nothing. Come on folks. I‚Äôd better!!
‚Äî
This is a good app, and I love the idea of cash back. It‚Äôs relatively simple to operate and the cash back methods are pretty straightforward. However, it seems that every time the app upgrades, there is a MAJOR problem getting back into the newer version. The upgrades tends to logout the user (me) and logging back in just doesn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôve been trying for two days now and it will NOT accept me email or password. There is a link to have them email me a link to reset the password, but even that often does not work, and when it does work, I never receive an email link. And, yes, I‚Äôve checked my junk folder. There is simply no response. Experience with this app has taught me to wait for them to issue an update to the newest version‚Ä¶ typically within a week. This sort of annoyance should be worked out BEFORE the release. | Super easy to use at places I go to all of the time. | The extra savings is great. Love that groceries and restaurants use it too | Earned $120 to Amazon! Great app especially if you are on the road a lot! | So far I‚Äôve had this app on my phone for about a year and a half now and over half of the gas purchases that I made with this app have failed for no reason at all and I‚Äôve used the same card at the same gas pumps in sometimes you get credit, and sometimes you don‚Äôt and they never give you a reason as why you didn‚Äôt receive credit, it just says, expired, expired so I‚Äôm giving this app three star they need to fix the bugs on this app. I‚Äôm about to do a cash out on it if I don‚Äôt receive anything, I‚Äôm gonna give this app one star so far it‚Äôs not really worth it. | In this day and age it is really good to get something back on something I use every day. Just cashed out 130.00.  It takes about 5 minutes to set up and 10 seconds extra time at the station. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!! | Thank you for this access | App was good at first but after having it awhile it doesn‚Äôt always load or work when you pull up to the gas station. Boo! | I tried to no avail to transfer my cash into my credit union but I ultimately had to transfer it to a gift card instead. How frustrating! Thus is why I gave upside only 3 stars. | THIS APP DORS NOT HAVE A SECTUON FOR GROCERIES!  Had and restaurants, but NOT GROCERIES!  If I am wrong please explain her after a year of using it there is no GROCERY option! | Earn cash back on something we have to spend $$ on anyway. | I love that I get kick backs on gas. We mow, so it helps out so much. I only wish it helped with all gas stations. | I love the choice of rewards upside gives. | My app hasn‚Äôt been working for over 3 months | ùë®ùíëùíëùíçùíö ùëºùíëùíîùíäùíÖùíÜ ùë∑ùíìùíêùíéùíê ùë™ùíêùíÖùíÜ ‚Äúùëµùë®ùëªùüêùüêùüêùüêùüï‚Äù ùíòùíâùíäùíçùíÜ ùíîùíäùíàùíèùíñùíë ùíïùíê ùíàùíÜùíï $ùüìùüé. It does what it says it does. I've saved $40 on gas so far, and this app is free. So that's very nice. But it's a very frustrating app to use. The app works fine until it's time to actually prove to it that you filled up at the gas station with the offer you ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù. The app instructs you to tap a button that doesn't exist on the screen in order to ‚Äúarrive"" at the gas station. So I looked it up online and people say you have to log out and log back in. Then it prompts you with the option to ""upload receipt‚Äù which is what I do. But now the scanning technology which scans your receipt on the app doesn't work anymore! So I have to upload a pic instead. 
Logging out and logging back in after you've claimed your offer is what makes it eventually work, but not every time. Sometimes I have to wait a few hours after I've completed the transaction before logging out and logging back in will prompt the option to ""upload receipt"", which appears to be the only way I can prove to Upside I completed the transaction. 
It always works eventually, and I've saved $40 so far so that really is nice, but the app is buggy and has these issues. I really hope they fix it, it would be a dream to have this app finally just be smooth throughout the whole experience. But as of now it is a chore, they do make you work a bit for the savings. | You scammers, you want my credit card information?????? For what?????
If I upload a receipt is not enough????
And if you make charges to my credit card then who‚Äôs fault?????  Me because I gave you my information.

This is a real scam | Who doesn‚Äôt love saving money? You can‚Äôt lose with this app. Not only are you saving money from groceries and gas purchases you are going to make anyway, you are getting free money in cash back after those purchases are processed through the app. I‚Äôve saved hundreds of dollars and only wished I had started using this app earlier. It‚Äôs the one thing that isn‚Äôt too good to be true. | Love love this app | Can‚Äôt even cash out. Asks me to verify a link in my email to cash out. I click the link and it takes me to the App Store to download the app even though it‚Äôs already installed. No work around. | It won‚Äôt even let me log in to use üòí everytime I tried to use a different way to set up and account it wouldn‚Äôt get past that screen, or it would say I‚Äôve already got an email set up. | It never accepts when I pay then it expires and I don‚Äôt get the cash back | I enjoy the app, I wish it worked more gas stations. | I have had upside for about a year maybe more. At first it was ok now and then I would get a little bit of cash back. Maybe a couple bucks once in a while it would say there was an issue with my receipt. I didn‚Äôt pay it much attention but now every time I scan a receipt it takes forever to process then once it does process it gets rejected saying there was an issue found with my receipt. It either say date didn‚Äôt match or station didn‚Äôt match. I have a citgo card so that‚Äôs the only station I go to and I always scan my receipt right at the pump as soon as I am done pumping my gas. Waste of time. Not recommended. | Absolutely love this app | I really didn‚Äôt think this app was legit until I started using the app and man was I wrong it really does help you save and put money aside for rainy days I would recommend this app to anyone and everyone‚Ä¶ | Been using this app since 2018. Love it | Started out good. I don‚Äôt know if I got too many users, more than it could handle, but suddenly prices are not updated and the app is super glitchy. definitely done driving out of my way based on what the app says because it‚Äôs been wrong more than right lately, and customer service is non existent | App requires approval from the gas station which gets denied almost half the time. Garbage app | When I started using Upside, you could get cashback at grocery stores, but as of last year, 2023, grocery stores have been taken off the list and convenience were added in its place, but there‚Äôs nothing near me that is accepted on the on the app. The vast majority of the money I was rewarded came from groceries. Love the app, but stop advertising that there are rewards for groceries when there really isn‚Äôt. | Still have not been able to actually get this app to work as described. I have found multiple gas stations listed as available to be closed down. Then I have used it to fill up twice and never received any cash back. | I wasSent an email stating that my Upside account would be deleted if I did not continue to use the app. That is my hard earned money which I sent out on your app. I do feel that it should not be eliminated due to lack of activity. | Been using the app for over a year and got over $150 saved up.
Finally go to cash out and it will not send the cash.
When I select my bank account , it sends an email to click a link to initiate transfer.
That link just brings up a button to download the App. I already have the app!!
No customer service to help either.
Frustrating at best! | it seems out of nowhere transactions are taking 10+ days to process.. I'm waiting on cashback for seven offers for 11 days now. this app has been great for over a year now seems to be glitchingUPDATE:: still have not received cashback for 16 offers after using the app successfully for years I have finally deleted it garbage!!
Developers response? Submit a ticket? I HAVE! EMAILING BACK AND FORTH FOR DAYS STILL NO RESOLUTION | So far good to go. I have to fill up my work truck every couple of days. And it‚Äôs a small bonus. Love it. I have not put a dime on my Apple I-toons in a long time. | I‚Äôve been to the gas station that claimed to give a certain amount cash back. Card was on file. And many times it didn‚Äôt give anything back. Waited 4 days or so on each then it said expired. Don‚Äôt waist your time with it.. | Get app to use. I highly suggest it. | Upside you guys rock I actually get cash back for the gallons I pay at gas stations I love it | Not sure what‚Äôs going on but my last 4 submissions now say expired. 

I cashed out once for $10. Now I see nothing more than a penny or two per gallon. 

Meanwhile,  they‚Äôve sold my info to God knows who.
Don‚Äôt fool yourself. Your info is a commodity to them | Great app I‚Äôm cashing out at $59 due to the fact that I lost $54 credit prior and had to re enroll on a new account. | I use this app for gas and convenience stores and I like it.  I keep seeing groceries as a category in your ads, but even after updating it never appears on my app.  FRUSTRATING!! | New user, cannot add payment info. 
Cannot reach anyone from support. | I‚Äôve tried over FOUR times to submit on their HELP mobile contact, because I did not receive my $29 IHOP digital coupon. Cannot get anybody to answer me!!! it took me a long time to get my 29 points now they‚Äôre gone! | Anything that uses Plaid is just a way to get your information. Starts off saying how they use some great encryption to secure your info then when you use Plaid and sign into your bank it shows you all the information you are about to give up. Not worth the savings. I‚Äôll try the gift cards but I‚Äôm sure there is a twist there also.

Plenty girls but non of them replay so been using Match and Meet  for 8 years but never talk with anybody yet. | After using Tinder on and off for 6 months with the same patterns repeating themselves (no one talks, odd small talk, no meet ups then ghosting) I came off and was done with the new age of internet dating. 
A friend recommended Match and Meet and I liked the fact the women has to talk first. The etiquette was very unclear on Tinder, who messages who first ? Match and Meet takes that away - you have to message otherwise you lose your match. 

Been using Match and Meet for around 2 weeks and already I‚Äôve had more conversations with people than I would normally have done. 

People seem more interested. Yes you get people who don‚Äôt message you back and the odd one who ghosts but it‚Äôs not half as much as what it was on Tinder. 

So far so good. Let‚Äôs see how it goes ! | Nasty GUI. | What kind of app is this now you guys should change the review of the app which one is heart everytime | No instructions on what‚Äôs going on can‚Äôt delete pictures that end up on there when you try changing them. No response from app support Can‚Äôt answer responses because supposed free whatever‚Äôs hearts? So dumb ~~ don‚Äôt exist So you‚Äôre in limbo after the first couple of messages you sent unless you pay. How is that trying out a ‚Äúfree‚Äù meeting people app?? | Like any dating app it‚Äôs hit or miss. There‚Äôs some weirdos, there‚Äôs some awesome people, and then everyone in between.

You can put as much or as little information as you want on your profile. I like that you can include height. 

You can also put yourself anywhere in the world without having to pay extra! | This application is definitely better version that the others. | This app is a fraud. It allows you to read the first msg from the people. However, it asks you to be a premium member to be able to see the second msg from the same person (or reply them). I did paid for the premium membership. But still not able to see the msgs. They haven‚Äôt provided any customer service number. There is only an email which nobody responds! I am so mad! | This application is not good at all, not fair they are just money makers and however much you subscribe to their monthly offers yo never get the offers they keep asking you to pay for more and more. I was charged twice first 10 dollars then 47 dollars but never got the services. Apple please consider removing this application from your store | THESE PPL ARE CROOKS DONT BUY THIS CRAP | This app is a scam, they scammed my 14:99$ and instructing robots to chat with me.
This app should be deleted from App Store, it so fake.
Don‚Äôt pay a dime for the app, you‚Äôll regret it.
Better refund my money, stop all this fraudulent act. | Look like a SCAM. Be careful with this app. Look like a scam it charged 6 times and each time for $11 and did not give the service to message. The apple did not give the refund for it. | Nothing serious I don‚Äôt recommend | This is a scam they want you to pay and after you pay no one will reply you back they send all the messages them self from the site | You can only message 3 people then upgrade 

Fake | Premium members shouldn‚Äôt pay to communicate with others who have paid also thanks | Pls don‚Äôt download the this app because they‚Äôre not going to refund back ur money | Ok | Very stupid app. How can I be paying every second. Don‚Äôt waste your time | Worst dating app ever, you can‚Äôt chat with someone even after buying premium subscription.  Lots of fake profiles!

Hotel Brijwasi by centrum we booked it for three people and they never told us that they do not have the bed they gave us a mattress to sleep on the floor. The rooms were dirty mattresses are dirty, even their couches were dirty. The phone in the room was not working we called the manager and he said that we do not provide the beds we just provide the mattress . make My Trip and Mr. Kapil ( make my trip customer support)who was supposed to be helping the customer was helping the hotel management . He said they don‚Äôt provide it but nowhere on the website or on the hotel website says that it‚Äôs just the mattress not the bed I had a senior citizen sleep on a mattress on the floor.
And yes bring your own hand towels as hotel doesn‚Äôt provide it. | It was wise to choose Indian air company to go to Kathmandu and return by Nepal airlines!üëçThanks! | This is the go-to app for booking flights/trains/buses within India. Great experience and highly recommend | Excellent Site for booking Air tickets | Good customer service | Reality üëåüëåüëåüëåüêì | Good | Whole experience was a nightmare. Hotel denied check in after fully prepaying amount and receiving confirmation message from MMT. I was traveling with family and kids and Had to find another hotel in midnight in new city. Horrible experience! | Place is very clean and tidy. Support staff is extremely helpful especially Mahesh. Definitely recommend this place to friends and other family members . | Great job | Superb | I was trying to reach customer service through their customer care number, however I have never reached to customer care as they haven‚Äôt allowed to talk with them | This is a MMT , is nothing but misguided you,
At the time of booking they send you 3 & 4 star resort &Hotel ,No doubt properties are good but in this property they have much more options in rooms,MMT associates with ITC and they are allotted you lower category rooms which have no proper light,No hot water,Not enough drinking water,and there are problems in Human waste drainage, again & again complaining to Receptionist counter but they don‚Äôt solved the matter 
Once again think twice to Book MMT Trips 
I m very disappointed,Once you gave money to him they don‚Äôt reply properly 
Third class service | I tried booking a couple of train tickets.  After a payment was submitted the system came back with an error message and said the money will be refunded to my Paytm account by Jan 12, 2024.  Today is Jan 13 and still no refund.

The website is totally bogus when it comes to customer support.  There are no phone numbers provided.  You have to keep going in circles to get some kind of help.

I‚Äôm planning to close my account and delete the app after receiving the refund. | You‚Äôre data is in china | I got to know It‚Äôs a Chines funded company and chines CEO for the Indian travel app so I removed this app from my Apple phone , hope other Indians will follow the same. | Their app is awful keeps crashing | Very simple and effective | Useless company | Still promoting Maldives on your site, you deserve one star | Totally frustrating experience. | Excellent prices and easy use keep going gys | We have not received my flight cancel refund from last eight months. When I try to call customer care, it keeps redirecting me to relationship manager. Tried to call relationship manager Ashwini thousand times but she is not replying at all. MMT removed refund request option from the app too. Looks like MMT trying to cheat 10 thousand customers this way. Our leh trip experience was really bad, hotels were so cheap even if we booked delux room. Water tank was leaked and room was filled with 1 feet of water at night when we woke up. üò±üò±üò±üò±üò± | Has all kinds of options related to travel | Recently book my train ticket and they give bogus confirmation of waitlisted and actually those tickets never confirm . This way they get profit by cut more charges from amount which you pay which is not right at all | I had multiple queries to customize the trip and all were promptly answered. | Hassle free booking and easy cancellations | This is probably the most buggy app I‚Äôve ever used | It‚Äôs was very nice hospitality. I had reservations for my mom for biometric USA embassy. We are from nepal. They spoke Hindi | Once you book you never get flight confirmation. Anytime it can cancel and hold you ransom to pay more. There is no customer service phone and rude arrogant employees.

Never will book with them.
strongly avoid this website.
Pay a bit more and peace of mind. | Treat as *****. Good luck | It's easy and convenient | Works great for flights and hotels reservations in India. | The worst app you can do booking throw I used to do many booking throw them and they deduct the amount twice few times and it took them months to refund it | Love MakeMyTrip. It is a beautifully designed App - intuitive, comprehensive and hassle free. In a span of 25 days, I have booked,cancelled, rebooked 15 flights, sent unaccompanied baggage, compared hotel rates - all within the App without any help. It is a life  saver for me when I visit India. | Very good response | This is really an wonderful app. They provide the service as per mentioned in the add | As someone not Indian, this app gives you amazing deals inside India. Highly recommend. | Good | Very easy and comfortable | Will use MMT again. | Prompt online action is appropriated. | Appreciate the regular wats app messages regarding my trip  updates | It was really a great experience using the app for booking and hassle free cancellation | I love the app!",4.71067,33930,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e0/e7/2d/e0e72de5-12ee-b261-a920-4cacc8b1d298/c19a62b7-29dc-4eb9-b429-e79768e91ec6_F1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/b5/22/94/b522943d-4296-3434-ea56-66546304fe9e/42533554-f9ca-4570-8eab-2d2a47b75a57_1242x2208-appstore2-230124.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/58/4a/d1/584ad111-e537-367a-73f3-324104af87da/2ca13719-b68d-4aae-9d97-3788a1477929_f2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/fb/84/93/fb849300-a014-b561-59f4-40506ba06628/ed6152d1-4d5d-45af-8471-85275d7ea407_book-hotel-wth-refund-ios-1242-2208__U00281_U0029.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/92/3e/e2/923ee255-7ab4-9cc4-625c-b30a8c0783e6/6b0032ec-a49e-42e9-bb41-1bfdf6b58bc1_f4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/7a/74/f5/7a74f565-2917-f42e-99ef-454d6116b52c/9e42c88c-597f-42b7-b0bd-94fae8a574bb_f5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/07/dd/57/07dd57cc-2965-ffd8-c41c-af72e0944a2e/9fee12a7-349e-4636-a49a-cdd86492bc9c_f6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/55/ad/9d/55ad9d36-e462-7cd7-8827-fa60f542604f/12522a0c-1416-4040-a8c5-42e0dd39eb7b_f7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/fd/66/94/fd6694b0-4ac0-0e58-2054-87031069fd8a/5ec83d6f-25c2-4460-b189-c48a7cbecb8a_f8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

ALOHA | Chuck (the appointed name for our tour guide) was great, guiding us through with great advice, funny jokes, and history lessons. By the end of our 13 hour journey, we felt like Chuck joined our family. | Did the reverse road to Hana today and the tour was great. Would unpause if I forgot as GPS picked up where we were. Had great stop suggestions and worked better than expected. Commentary and music was fantastic. So worth the money. | Great guided tour with plenty of fun options and local insights. | This app made our road to Hana and return from Hana so much more enjoyable! The guide was incredibly helpful and informative. | Fantastic & informative! A must have app for great ‚ÄúRoad to Hana‚Äù guide and nice music! | Absolutely loved this tour guide. Really loved learning the history of Hawaii! | We purchased the classic road to Hana package on this app and it was amazing. The descriptions of all the places where great and it gave you a lot of heads up about what was coming up. We would not have found Aunties Banana Bread without it since it is off the beaten path. But this app took us right to it. It‚Äôs also selected all the best places to stop and little tricks and hints to help you avoid any issues. One the best parts of the app it plays Hawaiian music for you to enjoy during your entire trip. By far it was money well spent and could not have seen everything without this app. Thank you God bless. | Great app. We used for the Road To Hana: well done, funny and very useful! Spot ON!! | Loved the app, so informative, interesting and the history lessons were great!  Will use this app for other tours!  Thank you for a delightful day! | It was great. The dialogue was great and informative. Would buy again for sure. Thx | We bought the app to use well touting the reverse road to Hana. It was great. It was like having a tour guide in the car with us. The Hawaiian music that played when the guide wasn‚Äôt talking made  drive not seem so long and jh went perfect with the scenery. You don‚Äôt have cell data almost the whole drive so it was nice that the app shows you where you are in real time, plus the music is nice since you can‚Äôt get any stations on the radio or cell service. I would definitely buy and again on another tour. | Before this, I have never paid for an app nor have I ever reviewed one. I heard about this app on a podcast and decided to try it. We did the road to Hana once before with a guide book and it was awesome. However, the Shaka app is waaaay better than a book. We stayed over in Hana for a few nights so used the app when we drove up and again when we headed out to explore each day. Our trusty Shaka guide was always ready when we were. He provides great places to stop, helpful advice, great info on Hana history and culture. If you‚Äôre doing the road to Hana, get this app! | If you are traveling the road to Hana, this app is the best and so fun to listen to. Worth the $20!!! | This is the best app guided tour, great speaking voice, easy to understand, and cheerful. You are guided step by step and don't miss a thing. So worth it! | I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this app! We have driven the Road to Hana before, but I was amazed at how much more information this guide gave than previous audio guides we‚Äôd used, as well as how many things we‚Äôd missed out on during prior trips. The GPS worked perfectly, and we were able to visit many of the must do attractions, as well some of those that are lesser known. I would recommend reading the ‚Äúbefore you go‚Äù article prior to your drive, as it was very useful in helping us prepare. We learned much about the Road to Hana attractions, interspersed with Hawaiian music and entertaining stories. It is ESSENTIAL that you download the app first, because there will not be cell service on most of the Road to Hana. Also, be sure you can charge your phone throughout the day. We bought the entire Maui package, which included Haleakala among other tours, but we unfortunately ran out of time before we could use them. I guess that just means we‚Äôll have to go back soon! | This was an absolute must have for our recent trip on the Road to Hana. Having done the road in the past, I was amazed at how much info the Shaka Guide provided compared to audio guides we'd used previously. There were so many things we'd missed on prior trips that this guide pointed out, interspersed with great music and interesting stories. The GPS worked perfectly the entire day, and the guide's stories about Hawaiian history kept us engaged on the drive home in the dark. It's ESSENTIAL that you download the guide before you get on the Road to Hana, as there will not be cell service on most parts of it.

We bought the entire Maui package which included Haleakala among other guides, but unfortunately we ran out of time and weren't able to use them all. I guess that just means we'll have to go back! | We went on a lovely car tour and this app really made the day for us. Well worth the money. | Really enjoyed this guided tour, and my sisters also had the guide so we were travelling in 3 separate cars in different intervals but getting the same info. There's something very soothing about the narrator (we called him Mr Shaka)'s voice...makes you feel like youre in Disneyland, telling you to strap your seatbelts and keep hands inside the cab during the ride. I liked that the GPS is spot on to where you are on the map, and will more or less give you a signal when to look left or right, up or down. I especially enjoyed the history parts and since we dont have internet during the drive, he was a conforting source of info.
Anyway, we did Haleakala sunrise and Road to Hana. I totally recommend it, and will definitely check out the others for other tours on our next visit. | This was the best purchase of our whole trip. Worth every penny! Tour was perfect - all thanks to our favorite tour guide, Tony. We enjoyed listening each way of the trip, learning awesome facts about the culture and history of Hawaii. The guide led the whole way and made sure we saw all of the best spots in perfect time. We literally want to send fan mail - OBSESSED | Is there a 6th star I can give for this app? 5 isn‚Äôt enough! I downloaded this the night before we took the road to Hana and it immediately informed me that I needed a reservation for one of the state parks along the way which I was then able to acquire, so that we were able to visit the following day. We very much enjoyed the narrations along the way, the GPS guided tour, and stops we never even knew about.  The informative stories and cultural knowledge shared was the icing on the cake. Highly recommend and would definitely use again. | Very helpful and informative. Made the trip so much better. | This was a great way to enjoy the Hana hwy and hear about sights in a timely and fun manner. Will be recommending this app to friends who travel to Hawaii in the future! | This app is awesome! Getting this app and purchasing the tours was one of the best things I did for our Hawaii vacation! The helpful information was wonderful and the history we learned while following the tour was so interesting. It was so easy to use. | We love hitting the road and tuning into the tours by Shaka. They are the perfect amount of history, music, and pro tips for local food and stops along your road trip. | We did both road to Hana and Haleakala sunrise tours while on Maui.  The tips of where to stop were priceless and helped us navigate without the stress of knowing when and where the best places were to stop.  The food suggestions were also great! | Using this guide felt like having our own personal local guid right in our own vehicle!

Highly adjustable to whatever needs or priorities such as waterfalls, hikes, etc.

Definitely recommended and looking forward to checking out the National Park series as well. | This app is the move, y‚Äôall! Downloaded it based on other recommendations and we are so glad we did. It absolutely made the trip. From the guy‚Äôs fun and upbeat voice to the cultural and historical tidbits along the way to the music and the fact that he knows exactly where you are the whole day, we couldn‚Äôt imagine doing this drive without it. 100% recommend! | Great tour! We loved the way this tour interacts with us and our location. It was precise and descriptive. We did not feel like we had to guess about anything. There was great guiding, storytelling, and music the whole way. Highly recommended! | Awesome guided tour containing everything you need to know as you drive through the Road to Hana. It also plays vibey Hawaiian music as you travel through your adventure. | We were skeptical at first because we thought it might be a little cheesy, however, we loved it! Just the right amount of jokes, history, and stuff to know. The music was great too! The GPS tracking worked perfectly. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough! | Over all the app is good. I really liked the tour drive to Haleakala. It was helpful and provided good advice, history, and knowledge of the area. 
In the road to Hana (classic) there are a few issues. No opening times for stops like the twin falls. And then the guide talks about talking time to enjoy the smell sounds and the views. But then it says to look at the next falls from the car because no parking private property locals want to minimize visitors. It kinda kills the ability to enjoy the experience. 
Otherwise the road to Hana had the same pluses as Haleakala. 
The itinerary needs to add up front all the costs and reservations in one place with an alternative free place that is accessible. The state park time reservation messed us up. I don‚Äôt know if you can help with that. | Best money I‚Äôve spent while being in Maui | Worth every penny.  Made the trip much more relaxing and enjoyable, knowing what was coming next and not worrying if we were missing anything. | This app is nothing short of amazing! We used it for the road to Hana and driving to Haleakala. The narrator was fun and interesting, also such a great voice! The guide knows where you are and what is ahead. If you miss something, he‚Äôll comment about it. He says what places to skip if you are low on time, even said we‚Äôd see cars parked ahead; but it was private property! Once we completed our route, he told such interesting stories on the way back. Highly recommended this app, absolutely no down side! | This App was fantastic. It‚Äôs all you need to see the sights on the route. Tons of helpful tips and direction. The history provided was informative and the hawaiian music in between stops was the best and really added to our Hawaiian experience.  This app saved us a ton of money vs paying for a tour, if you have the the stomach to drive the road yourself, this app is a must. Mahalo | If you‚Äôve never driven on the road to Hana, this app is a must have. So much fun and things we saw that we would never seen without the app. | Just finished the road to Hana and can‚Äôt believe how awesome this self guided tour was. The experience was so immersive and UNIQUE. I cant wait to do another trip just to try this app out again. A++++ 100 stars! | Great tour, very informative. Needed a little more direction for the sea arch. | This is our first time on the road to Hana and we decided to drive it ourselves and not take a tour bus because it is A LOT cheaper but we didn‚Äôt know where the sights on the road were.  I‚Äôm soooooo glad I found this app.  The guide was very insightful and extremely easy to follow.  You get more than a tour, you get the music, very well told stories and the history told to you along with some humor.  You won‚Äôt miss a thing with this app. | I‚Äôm not one to purchase these type of things. But I am on Maui during the wildfires. I did the road to Hana. I‚Äôm traveling by myself and this tour guide was great. Told you where to stop things you would never even know about. Told you where not to stop. Kept you on track for timing sake. Plays music the whole time. The tour guide tells you stories in history about the area. I did not feel alone on my road to Hana. There was great space between the stories, so it didn‚Äôt ramble on they would pause, play some music and come back to the story. This is worth purchasing and was put together by Local‚Äôs! | We really love Shaka Guide tour. This is Our second time to purchase this app. We got the Shaka Oahu Bundle tour first, then this Shaka Maui Bundle tour. Best self guided tour ive found. You can‚Äôt miss any attraction on the island/s and will even suggest some good eats along the way. Shaka is so entertaining and we learned a lot about the Hawaiian cultures and legends. And we really appreciate the Hawaiian background music as well. So worth it! Mahalo Shaka! | We enjoyed the guided tour with directions, suggestions, hints, and jokes.  Loved the history lesson on the way back.  You might have a book, but you don‚Äôt want to look at a book when you could instead be looking at the beauty of the Road to Hana. | Traveling with my large family in 3 cars, the recommendations were RIGHT on for all ages (5yo-80yo). Been to Hana numerous times, but never before like this ü§ô | We had the best day on the Road to Hana using the Shaka app! We felt like we had a tour guide in the car with us giving us turn by turn directions. We felt like we had an inside scoop on hidden stops to see. We loved the Venus Pools at the end of the trip! We had a great day and highly recommend using the app. Mahalo! | Excellent tour filled with interesting information. I enjoyed the thematic Hawaiian music scattered throughout the listening tour. I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing the Road to Hana without this app! The narrator told us where we were, where to park, what there was to eat, where the bathrooms were and how long until the next bathroom, what costs a fee and what is free, and so much more! Use this app! | Husband 100 % against against buying this tour and then he fell in love with it on the road to Hana. Highly recommend to anyone traveling  Maui. We did Classic road to Hana, west Maui tour, and sunset Haleakala. We loved all of the history, stories,music. Made the trips so much better. We got to see and experience sights that we would not have know about on our own. | What a wonderful app! So glad our friend recommended it! Such great detail and wonderful stories! | AMAZING. this app is perfect. I recommend all the stops he tells you to stop at. It‚Äôs so detailed and interesting. My 18&20 year old sons were waiting. Yo be tortured by a tour and this app but ended up loving it and super interested in everything he said.

I open this app, I tap on my station and... I get an ad. A freaking ad!! I can't think of a worse possible time to force users to sit through an ad than when they desperately need the info on the other side of that ad instantly. developers, find better placement for your ads!! | It shows you an ad while you‚Äôre trying to look up if a train that‚Äôs coming goes to where you need it to. You don‚Äôt have enough time to wait for the ad to finish before the train leaves, so you miss your train. Don‚Äôt waste your time. | I get that ads are needed to support the app.,  but the timing of the ads need to be adjusted so that it doesn‚Äôt jump out at the most crucial time when one needs to view the map to make a critical decision. The length of the ads needs to be trimmed down as well. | The amount, frequency, and length of ads make the app annoying to use at best and completely unusable at worst. The UI is outdated and looks old. I‚Äôm convinced they make the unpaid version unusable so you‚Äôre willing to shell out yet another monthly subscription for an app that gives no unique information and offers nothing special. | Don‚Äôt take ads that take up the whole screen.  It defeats the purpose of the ap | Full screen video ads popup as I'm trying to quickly look up directions or stop info while riding. They're the kind that are hard to close and cause accidental clicks. Incredibly annoying as I wait for it to play and almost miss my stop. | I know that because it is a free app, you need funding from ads, but if you use this app, you are most likely out of town, and want to find the best subway route fast, or you live in New York, and you are in a hurry, trying to find the best route. Ads every other second is the last thing you need when you are in a hurry. Again, I know that you get your funding from ads, but this is out of control. | Good job | Anytime you want to see the subway map you have to sit through 60 seconds of ads.

I deleted for a different one bc I‚Äôm tired of being forced to watch 2m of candy crush ads when I just want to know if the M or B/D will get me closer to my destination.

You have to WAIT for the train to pass to figure out a different route‚Ä¶ | If I could give an app negative stars I would. It is almost impossible to look at the map without an ad popping up. And you can‚Äôt exit the ad without it sending you to a separate site. Unbelievably frustrating. | The app has very aggressive ads and it will not allow you to navigate away. It locks up and hijacks your phone and the only way to exit will be to close the app. This is ridiculous. | Constant adds. | Ads. Too  many pop ups | I used this app during my last trip to the city and found it wonderful for navigating the subway. This new version is now utterly useless as you can‚Äôt use the app without being forced to watch ad after ad after ad. I am deleting this app. | It was easy to navigate. I couldn‚Äôt get to the Service updates.  Only wanted to confirm that the F stops at Lex & 53 Street.  Five seconds after opening the APP a pop up took over insisting that I download a ‚Äòlife changing‚Äô game.  I could not close the pop up.  

Best solution:  I deleted this App that I had for fifteen years and downloaded the official MTA app.   What a shame.  Don‚Äôt force people to look at your Ads.  I do pay for other apps. | Muy util para moverse por la ciudad | Whenever you open the app, you get about 2 seconds before the ads start playing.  Then even if you finish watching the ad, if you switch to a different app and switch back, you‚Äôll get another ad.  Literally unusable.

Was not like this when I first started using it a few years ago. | This app will constantly flood you with advertisements. Although the app is very precise, they use ads as a sort of extortion to entice you to upgrade. Usually you only have moments to see train times before a new ad will come and block the app. Terrible overall. | Full of ads that get in the way of using the map | Adequate notifications, maps updated every delay or year. Once used it 2 years ago. Useful if you don‚Äôt want to go all the way to the end of the platform and rushing to the front if train is approaching the station.

I deleted the app and am now trying to download it again. | This app should be removed as it is now just and endless stream of spam/ads popping up. I can‚Äôt even get the info I need in time to catch the train. Just download a free pdf of the map and uninstall this bloatware. | Could be a decent app, but the only intrusive advertisements, the free version vexing to use. | App started out ok but if you‚Äôre actually trying to navigate the subway you‚Äôll have to wait for minutes if Ads. Yes, minutes. Ridiculous. Just get the MYmta app instead. No ads, same maps. | I don‚Äôt mind ads. I know this app is free but it‚Äôs too much. The ads pop every single use, or just see different route. 

Just too much! 
Thank you. | 30 second ads when you need to look at the map?? | What a joke. This app will charge you $99 after 72 hours. It says it is free. What they don‚Äôt say until the app is downloaded is that it is only free for 72 hours. | Have no idea how to follow R to L. What does that mean, other than the lines! | Ads displayed in this application is super aggressive. After opening the ads for 5 seconds, a full screen un-skippable ads will take over the entire screen. An X button will appear after another 2-3 seconds, but clicking this button only redirect the user to advertiser‚Äôs website. Even when users wait until the ads finished playing, they will often time left with a black screen with no way to interact with. I would pay to make this app a bit more usable, but often time I cannot even get to the in app purchase screen. Overall, the app is particularly rage inducing especially when user tries to learn what schedule modifications were under time pressure. | This app serves one function - to display a map. The forced Ads have ruined this simple function and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating to have 30 seconds to decide to get on a train or not and to be served and ad you can‚Äôt skip. Terrible.  Delete | Thanks to your 30 to 45 second ads that cannot be clicked out of, I have missed my train several times. I will be deleting this app and finding another means of train info. This app is so unreliable. No thanks

I‚Äôm so happy I deleted this app and found better alternatives. | Was a good app but now is full of annoying ads | This app used to be great and was my favorite. I didn‚Äôt have any problem watching an ad or 2 here and there because it was free so whatever. But now it has become unusable. The ads trap you in an unexitable nightmare and you will never be able to access the map which is the whole point. Pick anything else and you will be better off. I‚Äôve had this for at least 6 years and now it‚Äôs less than worthless | So many ads and so often you can‚Äôt use the app. Horrible.

Good about advance notice of roadwork or re routings are flagged well in advance! | Won‚Äôt with and my Toyota tundra | I thought this app might have roadblocks and traffic congestion updates. I was wrong. When I came to 1604 and I 10 every loop was blocked off and that wasn‚Äôt shown on this map and so I applied them using the proper links. And when I got away from that area, it kept trying to reroute me back to that area that I had just blocked all off. Slow. 
When I arrived at my destination, I tried to put in some information, and it asked about how the route was. And then it went away. I went to another section on this app where it said rate app and the app did nothing so that I couldn‚Äôt rate it. | This app has coffee,restaurants, gas etc. at the top of the page covering the space where I have to type in the address. It‚Äôs very frustrating. | Just see the title and you get the idea.  Scout Maps has no clue how to maneuver or recognize Blocked Traffic & Detours.  Why not HIRE MORE PROGRAMMERS??!!  Running on empty with your profit margins??  I love not being chained to Google Maps directing me how to drive, so I really hope you‚Äôll improve your services!!
Sincerely,
Captain P  Princeton‚Äô73 | Because it‚Äôs acting Im in San Jose when I‚Äôm in Palmdale | I used to love this app I don‚Äôt use it very often, but when I needed it, it was available. Over the last six months when I‚Äôve gone to use it, the App will start navigation, and then just turn off! Which means I would have to pull over re-enter the address and then try to drive and watch my phone for navigation completely useless at this point please get this fixed!! | Apart from losing my address book, the current version of scout ‚Äúhangs‚Äù on profile. I installed it on my wife‚Äôs iPhone 5 my brand new 6 and m daughters 6. Same ‚Äúhang‚Äù that says ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù I believe Telenav GPS was more configurable for detail. But I will attribute that to ‚Äúlearning curve‚Äù Everything tells me Scout is a downgrade. | Directions are adequate but the voice is computerized and annoying and no options for changing it | I had this on my Android phone and it worked flawlessly.   Got it for my iPhone and what a disappointment.  Half the time it can not find what I‚Äôm searching for and a lot of times it takes me on the longest route for some place that‚Äôs fairly close by. | The gps works well. Support was good. Now they are ending support for their sister product Scout link. They took my $15 for a year of service of scout link now they won‚Äôt refund me the rest of my unused subscription. So buyer beware before giving them a dime. | I would rather use a paper map than this app! | Sends me on wild goose chases. Sometimes when i could take a street one way down i directs me in a maze of going many miles away only to com back almost right next where i started. Needs to more user friendly. Used to love it. But now hate that it gives so many bad directions. Doesnt show many options restaurants or things nearby. | I love this app-why? Because it advises me in advance what the next turn is-not when I am 5‚Äô from the turn! Keep up the good work. üòä | I specifically told it to take one route and it was trying to send me on one of the other route obtains. And kept trying to redirect me!  Ugh!  It‚Äôs so frustrating!!   üòî üò© | Difficult to use! | This app, which I use all the time at home in NV, has gotten us lost TWICE in the same day in AZ. | App is no longer working says no internet connection when there is one | It used to make me go around in circles I was loosing time and money.
I prefer Google maps | Hi, I‚Äôm giving Scout another chance but Google is better with no toll rides and no highway driving.   It also has faster routes with or without Highways | At the top of the screen, the search bar is so close to the links under it you can not select it without trying four or five times this is highly annoying. The screen should better fit my cell phone, which is where it is used predominantly | I love using ‚ÄúScout‚Äù, I is easy to use and uncomplicated. I always get to were I‚Äôm headed without stress. Have been using this app for many years (have tried other apps & always come back) | When using this navigation app 3 out of 4 times it has NOT gotten me to where I needed to go so I definitely would not recommend it | I have to go to the ap store and open scout from there. What a pain. | Nothing happens stopping working for months | It doesn‚Äôt alert to traffic, police, construction | I will be deleting your app after having used it happily for many years the new look makes it impossible for me to type an address in. What in the world did you do and why would you do it. I would now rate this app lower then 1 star before and easy 4 to 5 stars now I would tell everyone I know to pick a different driving app sorry | Reading the EULA to this is pretty terrifying. Basically whatever you search for in navigation you give to people trying to hire or sell something to you. Imagine that next time you‚Äôre hoping for a bug fix on the app, probably not where your resourced data is going to. I don‚Äôt care how well their navigation and map system is and I won‚Äôt find out. NEXT! | Difficult to use. 
Should be able to delete/rename ‚ÄòWork‚Äô 
Adding new places is difficult | I thought I‚Äôd give the app another try‚Ä¶ But it was a little disappointing. It doesn‚Äôt display with the proper depth on my cars Apple play‚Ä¶and audio directions sounded spliced together. 

The visuals were faded and gray black and white only, as if I had some long outdated app. 

I think I‚Äôll be looking for something else. | Have to fiddle all the time. Application not detected on phone?  I‚Äôm in the app on phone. All software up to date. 

Maps?  Not there unless you fiddle. 

A pain in the butt. | as you idiot makers should know, gas is super expensive right now. This app has either brought me through the longest route possible or has given me incorrect directions (and yes I always make sure I put the right address in). So thank you‚Ä¶you‚Äôve been rea helpful. üôÑ | Used it for years but last update totally screwed it up
After years of  using it I have to replace it it‚Äôs totally different better way | Very often fails to load in my car and says try again later.  I do not need it later!!!! | This app does not have current, accurate data. For example, there are nearby shopping directions for a department store that‚Äôs been closed/out of business for at least 10 years.  How to trust other data, or risk being led to undesirable destinations! Before realizing the app was unsatisfactory, I linked it to my vehicle and now it can‚Äôt be removed from the vehicle‚Äôs dash screen.

Signed,
Extremely frustrated with this app | I have used this app everyday for 5-10 years now and has very many addresses that I go to for work. Now I can not even get it to load or turn on. Updated Scout and tried everything. Very disappointed. I really do like the layout and how this gps has operated in the past. Sure hope they‚Äôre not trying to get too fancy with it and just stick to how it used to be‚Ä¶ | It‚Äôs such a shame this app has no turn off speaker ability. Many times when driving I turn the speaker icon on top right off and the directions still come through my car. This is very disturbing and dangerous as a few times I‚Äôve jumped at being startled. Please fix this‚Ä¶üôèüôèüôè | App no loading please fix | It says it take 3.13 hours to get to Columbia an it only takes 1.48 hrs through google ! It took me up am down all sorts of roads to go straight to the bay bridge !! It‚Äôs a straight shot thank god I knew the straight shot but was using it to get to Baltimore ! Ludicrous!! I use to love this app what happened ???? | It will not connect to the Toyota app | T this app will not pull up my home address | Pretty good map. | Your app has a major flaw. I live in the eastern part of the US. So if I want to travel to the central region of the US. I would to delete the east maps and download the central maps.  A very disadvantage. I should be able to download all regions at once. | It asks for phone number before it will do anything. | Map is too small to see anything on screen.Waze and Hooke maps are much better | GPS minus FAANG. | Spent hours trying to get this app to work. Went online for tips and tricks. Tried it ALL. Never got the phone to pair up in my 2019 Tundra JBL Navigation radio system. Deleted, Bye. | I love Scout GPS. The turn by turn voice guide and map helps a lot to drive conveniently to my destination. Even if I missed my turns it takes me back to the right route. | I‚Äôve used scout forever. But one day a few months ago by now I turned it on to notice the display box in upper left corner of screen with the big arrow that shows your anticipated direction keeps flashing every second!!!!!!! It is super ANNOYING and a distraction to the driver. It is a SAFETY HAZARD. And I absolutely hate it. I updated the app to see if it goes away but it never does. Now I‚ÄôM going away from Scout and going to try some other navigators. Sorry this is going on cause I‚Äôve used scout as my go to for years. | A waste, it crashes constantly",4.5594,6330,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/28/90/a4/2890a4ef-65cf-65b4-8c50-e29dfc354e15/4f885f44-978d-4cbc-906a-b5fbde1212ac_Frame_34233.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/55/84/ac/5584ac2b-c061-f550-bbc0-6920d22ad095/595aeed0-a748-4510-ad74-0991adaa740c_Frame_34234.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/73/b5/bf/73b5bfa7-f3eb-d993-d300-26f0a8886d41/8ea99ee5-62c0-4374-983f-50a889363183_Screen-03_New.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/23/ee/d4/23eed4d4-e1d4-be00-514d-be228052433d/2ee59d9b-7f7d-43b9-bfbd-da6771c34b67_Screen-04B.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e8/6c/3a/e86c3a46-1970-a4d7-a9e0-a5b1f8801369/3f2dba93-7093-42e6-904f-71579adbff10_Screen-05B.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/71/2b/f2/712bf2e7-71aa-bf27-77e3-684dff695d2b/0a5eee78-e1e4-48a7-bd7e-192bf8893a75_Screen-06B.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/0c/f2/ca/0cf2cad8-3aee-46b9-40ac-3c61bb3c432b/933baf00-2e41-4f33-97dd-00b0dcf8e31d_Screen-03B.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource221/v4/c9/33/b8/c933b830-15d5-5979-7c55-148c54e5b2ad/0a177ce9-f7af-4fe6-8977-f354949469df_Frame_34235.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

An ad every time you pass a level! How do you expect people to invest their time when most of their playing experience is watching ads? 

I do want to say that I really enjoy the game. But the ads makes rip my hair out. Please, at least space out the ads or something! | This game is cool in theory but it‚Äôs way too easy and not satisfying because you rarely ever fill the suitcase all the way. | why is there an ad after EVERY SINGLE SUITCASE?! BRO WHAT THE F- | This game seemed like it would be fun however, there was WAY TOO MANY ADS! I understand that that‚Äôs where a lot of you make most of your money with these games but without people playing them people wouldn‚Äôt purchase advertising space with you. An ad every few rounds is one thing but every one is maddening. I‚Äôm sure the thought process is that the more we assault them with them, the more likely they will buy the game so as not to have to deal with them. That‚Äôs exactly the opposite with me, which is why I deleted it. I don‚Äôt appreciate arm twisting, virtually or otherwise. | Very fun game I had it on my last phone awhile back and decided to redownload. But with the insane amount of ads I find it very difficult to enjoy the game. After every single level there is an ad and this is a very fast paced game in my opinion so after only 25 seconds max on each level I feel as if I shouldn't have to watch more than 1 add a minute let alone 5‚Ä¶ | I‚Äôve never felt so seen by a game. I love organizing, and this game is so cute and fun! However, and hear me out please, the ads are downright prohibitive to playing. I would love the option to pay one time to get rid of them. It takes me 5 seconds to play a level, and then I have to sit for a 30 second ad. Makes no sense. Thanks for considering! | I llllllllloooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | literally the most satisfying game and there is no adds (i'm not sure if it's gone for everyone tho). i wold really recommend this game for maybe a long flight bc in my opinion this game is hard to get bored of so i just think that this app is just really awesome!! <3 | I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!! First off there is no ads. second off all clothes/items you have to put in your suitcase is so so so adorable and cute. Third off this game is my favorite ever it's just perfect with the no ads it makes me feel so overjoyed and happy it's so freaking relaxing feel as if I could drift off to another world where everything is just so kawaii. | This is my favorite game ever because it is so fun and it has smooth gameplay and it is so satisfying I played it last night and this morning and it‚Äôs so fun and anyone can play it and join the fun! | Why can‚Äôt games be enjoyed anymore without stupid ads? There‚Äôs literally an ad every 1-2 levels, it‚Äôs obnoxious and makes me immediately delete the game | This game is literally perfect except the number of ads. I can‚Äôt only play a couple levels at a time because it gets so overwhelming. For the next update it would be awesome if you could purchase ad free play!! | I simply deleted after the second ad | Spend ten seconds solving a level and then a minute on ads in between EVERY level | I love this game it is ad free unlike every game I know and it's addicting. If ur reading this go play it it is an amazing game. | And it‚Äôs those 5 step adds that make you click ‚ùå a bunch of times. Between every level. There‚Äôs no way to pay to remove them, no way to get around them, no reward for watching them. 

If not for that, I‚Äôd enjoy the game. It‚Äôs simple and repetitive, but the art is cute and it makes me want to pass the levels. | This game is great but there are way too many ads. You watch more ads than you actually play the game. Airplane mode doesn't get rid of them. | There is a commercial every 30 seconds. I‚Äôm on level 10 and I‚Äôm not even given the option to pay for removal of ads. Don‚Äôt bother. But it for $1.99 on the switch and it will be ad free. | Got tiresome after level 20 because every break in the game is a long ad | Would love this but there are so many ads good Lordy I hate it because of that | This app is the best everybody says, to many adds. But I think that there are no adds I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH Ahem I love this game so much I recommend if you like to be calm üòå. DOWNLOAD IT NOW. Ÿ©(‡¥∞ÃÄ·¥ó‡¥∞ÃÅ)·µá ∏·µâ bye ‚ô°‡¨òüòé‡¨òüòÅ‡¨ì‚îê(Ôø£„ÉºÔø£)‚îå | There‚Äôs just too many. Not even an option to buy out of ads. Game is great but it‚Äôs ruined by the sheer amount of ads you get. | I really like the design of this game. Even the little app icon is adorable. the items are cute, love the colors, layout, etc. There‚Äôs even confetti when you complete a level which I think is a nice touch.

I really like this concept for a game as well. Something about sorting games is very calming and a good way to take a break.

The only (and I mean ONLY) issue with this game is the amount of ads. I know a lot of these games are marketed towards children who don‚Äôt know any different, but for anyone trying to play a game as simple as this, with levels as easy and short as they are, having an ad after every single level is nauseating. 

I, and a lot of other people as well, would love to play games like this if there wasn‚Äôt the constant worry about getting repetitive ads. I am completely aware of the need for ads to keep free applications sustainable, but there should at least be some incentive to watch them or reward for it. i have no issue with ads, but rather the frequency. If you give the player even half as many ads, I and others would probably be more inclined to keep playing. 

Keeping ads lower might actually increase profit as people won‚Äôt delete the game (like I have), meaning your players will want to play longer, and new people won‚Äôt be turned away by it.

This is an issue I see very prevalently and I would LOVE to see a change in this type of development soon.

TL;DR: Lovely game, very cute, too many ads to actually enjoy the experience. | Every single round is an ad. Gross waste. You‚Äôll watch ads longer you‚Äôll actually play. | Literally unplayable because there is a 10 sec ad after every single level. Love the game but couldn‚Äôt handle more than 5 minutes before the app felt like an ad-watching simulator with quick packing mini-games in between. | Great game but we need more levels. I‚Äôm tired of repeating 260. | Look, I love this game. It‚Äôs a great way to pass the time and really helps with stress. But these adds are getting carried away. There‚Äôs one after almost every level, and a level could only take you 5 seconds to solve. At least space out the advertisement so we can actually enjoy playing. | Why are there ads after every level? I spend more time watching ads than actually playing the game | Áé©ÂæóÂ•ΩÂ•ΩÁöÑÔºåÁõ¥Âà∞ÈÄÄÂà∞‰∏ªÈ°µÁúãÂà∞‚ÄúÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø‚Äù„ÄÇÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÊòØÂ±û‰∫é‰∏≠ÂõΩÁöÑ‰∏ÄÈÉ®ÂàÜÔºå‰∏çÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™ÂõΩÂÆ∂ÔºåÊúõÁü•ÊôìÔºåËøô‰πà‰ΩéÁ∫ßÁöÑÈîôËØØËøòÂú®ÁäØÔºåÁû¨Èó¥Ê≤°ÊúâÂÖ¥Ë∂£Áé©‰∫ÜÔºåÊûúÊñ≠Âç∏ËΩΩ„ÄÇ | there are too many adds, i could see how this could be a fun game but srsly?? | It could be a good game if there wasnt ad after every round or level. Wo annoying ! | I downloaded this game today and I realized that after every level there was an ad and I know ads are important but this game has like ALOT and that kind of ruined it for me. | This is a very good game but there are so many ads after every single level i get like 1-2 ads sometimes 3! Again this is a very good game I just wish there were less ads | This kind of game is my jam! I was trying to get into it, but an ad after EVERY level is excessive.  üò© I‚Äôm sad to be uninstalling this game. It‚Äôs relaxing, fun and right up my alley. | Can‚Äôt even enjoy the game :\ I would give 5 stars if there wasn‚Äôt an add every round | You don‚Äôt. So that‚Äôs obviously abusive. And the ad frequency is abusive too. The game itself seems pretty mediocre as well in my opinion | I bought this game thinking it would be fun because I could get rid of the ads. But it turns out that there is no option to get rid of the ads!!! It‚Äôs like if I told someone if they paid me a dollar I would not punch him in the face. And then I hide his dollar and then punch him in the face over and over. You could have at least changed what it says! It‚Äôs not rocket science! You just have to delete the option for in-app purchases and then your done! | An ad after every level is too much. It‚Äôs a cute and relaxing game, but it‚Äôs ruined by the excessive ads, which make me angry. | way too many ads. i dont think its necessary to be an ad after every single level | Can you please port this game to steam? | App description says that there is an in-app purchase to remove ads but no option exists. 

Game is entertaining enough but gets choked to death by frequent ads. | TOO MANY | The description of ‚Äúin-app purchases‚Äù says a no-ads feature can be bought for $1.99, but I can‚Äôt find any place within the app to buy it. In just the first few levels I already saw some pretty gross ads, NOT what I‚Äôm looking for in a relaxing puzzle app. | dude I cannot handle how many ads there are, maybe like every 2-4 levels but the ads are almost longer than the levels since they‚Äôre so easy. | Here is how you don‚Äôt have any ads so first after you finish a level instead of clicking continue click the menu button, then click home and then start your new level!!üòâ

Hope this helps | So every time I play it there is a add every time and it is very annoying but it was ok | It‚Äôs a good entertaining game and very relaxing, however there is an ad after every single level ad right after ad kinda ruins the whole thing and is why i decided to delete it in the end | The ads make this game unplayable and there is not in app purchase available to remove them which is just ridiculous. Deleted app 5 mins after downloading. | don‚Äôt get me wrong, i love the concept and graphics but personally, i can‚Äôt with having this many ads ! there is a ad after every level ! ik you have to make  money somehow but sheesh .. i use to love this game when i was younger but i don‚Äôt remember it having so many ads . i don‚Äôt love it anymore . | So when I was playing no mater what I was not

Thankfully CBP took over and made this app completely irrelevant. Now the developer is trying to be relevant by offering to store your ID that the airline already stores. Delete this app and keep your privacy from this unsavory developer. Developer: disappear yourself and the world will be a better place. | Thanks to the developers who made what was a very useful free app that saved me many hours waiting on long lines after long intl flights. It had worked so well, the gov had to take over so they could f it up. | Fake | The best I can tell now (11/2023) is that this App is basically non-applicable as all private Apps related to customs and country reentry are superseded by the Federal App, Mobile Passport Control. Remove all the extra language and just say it plain and simple. | They literally say it doesn‚Äôt work AFTER downloading it. False advertising | Arrived to Chicago on Sept.12.  No one knew anything about MPC.  Had to join a common line on passport control.  Missed our connection.  Misleading and very frustrating. | ot the airport has it this is better than gobal entry because its free | Some other commenters said the opposite, but for my family we skipped the MASSIVE line at the passport check in Atlanta by using MPC. We went to a separate line and there were only 3 people in it, instead of 500 in the regular line. I‚Äôm sure it saved us over an hour! | App no longer worth having because it‚Äôs not valid for entry or shortened lines. | Edit: While this app reigned for many years, its functionality is now in the official CBP MPC app. Not a fan of the redirect to the Airside app, though can‚Äôt blame the business for trying to salvage its user base. Airside app might be more helpful when more states support digital ID representations.

Landed MSP today and walked straight to the CBP officer past a line of folks waiting for the machine. Quickest reentry yet! Had scanned my passport, taken a photo, and answered the questions prior to landing. The passport scan function was impressive at reading the small font code at the bottom of the passport identity page. üíØ | App is no longer supported. Also lost faith when they said their partner was Rushmypassport- a company known for high fees, slow processing times, and bad customer service. Avoid both at all costs! | If the app is already downloaded, does not redirect you to the official CBP app, only it‚Äôs on Airside garbage app. Shame on the company. | Also had paid upgrades to make filling in form faster which was sleazy for a government service. MPC is the better app; fills in your data with a passport scan. | Zipped through Customs. Then had to wait for luggage.

UPDATE: NO longer used by US Customs | Unable to process. Over and over. Useless! | I recently used MPC at LAX after a trip to Europe.  It worked flawlessly and expedited our processing through customs. The line for US citizens was very long but we were directed to the Global Entry/MPC line.  There was no one in that line!  We proceeded to the agent, scanned our QR code, and presented our passports. We were then cleared in less than a minute. Great first time experience! | Per their app: 

CBP service no longer available
So sorry! CBP no longer allows any private mobile applications for the Mobile Passport Control program. | At the airport they now have two lines- one that‚Äôs 10 miles long and would take all day to get through, and then another line for all the sheeple dummies that download this app and scan their face and sign away their first born child just so they can avoid the inconvenient 10 mile long line and get through the airport in a reasonable amount of time. Screw Off I‚Äôm never flying again and i am deleting your terrible tyrannical app that is forced on people via inconvenience and frustration. Shame on you | This app doesn‚Äôt provide any service. | This App will download but immediately informs you that CBP no longer accepts it. | It's not the developer's fault, but this no longer works. Don't download. | Redirects to another app | Update: this app no longer does anything except advertise another (pointless) app called Airside. DELETED. 

A great initiative by CBP but the app is developed by a private third party. Initially 100% free, it is now subject to a $14.95 subscription fee. That‚Äôs understandable from a profit-making viewpoint, but that fee is really excessive compared to the value it provides. There is still a free version but it is almost useless: it only stores your passport information for 4 hours, which is less than most international flights‚Äô duration. The app urges you to ‚Äúbe prepared and enter your passport information before leaving‚Äù but that‚Äôs rather misleading. Greed has spoiled a good thing. | This app no longer functions. It‚Äôs only feature was to speed up customs and they removed that. | The app is not recognized by the US CBP. It‚Äôs a trash app. | As a travel agent with Heart Set On Travel, I always recommend this service to my clients for easy access back into the country. I recently used it as I entered through Philly, used the same line as Global entry and breezed right in. For a free app, why not have it, it is nice to not have to fill out paperwork & get a short cut! Highly recommended you have nothing to loose. | Came into LAX and the search function for find your port of entry does not work.  This should be a drop down menu. | xx | Pre loaded with personal passport information for the primary and family before a recent trip, this was a very easy and effective tool for bypassing the queue at passport control. 
Landed in Atlanta and answered the half dozen questions & snapped the required selfies on the walk from the airplane. Submitted and was able to use dedicated line assigned to MPC users (we were the only people in the ‚Äòline‚Äô).
Simply scanned QR codes and handed over our passports for a few moments; and, the process was complete. | I installed this app because it‚Äôs supposed to make reentry in the US easier. All it seemingly does is tell me to download two other apps. What am I missing? How did Apple approve this? | It didn‚Äôt work | This app is no longer supported by US CBP; you're now looking for the app called CBP MPC. üëçüèªüôèüèª | No longer available for people with old IPhone 6.  Software version available to phone not supported by developers. | I had used the free version but I found it overly time consuming to enter all of our passport information upon landing. Also required me to use international roaming data because airport Wi-Fi was not reliable. So for our next trip, I decided to upgrade to the pro version since it claimed we could store our passport information. It still didn‚Äôt work and once again I was left scrambling to enter all of our passport information upon landing. I did not cancel the subscription, hoping it would work for our next entry into the U.S. Upon opening the app, I now see this has been replaced by a new and free app that stores documents. I‚Äôm deeply disappointed that the developers would have even charged for a full year subscription knowing the app was going to be replaced well before then. | Tried and tried.  Didn‚Äôt work and then it says online that you have to have subscription to use this feature.  What good is a mobile passport app if you can‚Äôt scan the passport.  It seems it was changed in January to allow for more income from subscription.  Not recommending this product at all. | It was a decent app. Now it just redirects you to other sources. 

Last time I used it, it got me through customs really fast. It was awesome. Sad part was I had to wait for my luggage to arrive and lost all the extra time it gave me. | I got to use this app once going through customs. Not I get an update and it does what, redirects to another app now?

Scam. | So since the app doesn‚Äôt work anymore that means we should not be charged for the months that are left on the subscription right??? | Last two trips I haven‚Äôt been able to use the app, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm now curious as what the point is. | We skipped the entire crowd, (2-3 planes at same time).

Thanks | Arrived in Fort Lauderdale airport and treated rudely by airport employees and Homeland Security Agents for trying to use Mobile App even when having the approved QR code app issued. They claim that airport hasn‚Äôt accepted Mobile Passport for a long time. 
Your app should be updated and remove airports that don‚Äôt honor your service! | Great improvements | Unable to process through customs from SJD to SEA | It was awesome | Mobile passport worked perfectly and saved us quite a bit of time. | Incredibly easy and can be a major time saver! | Amazing reliable application to expedite immigration process | Didn‚Äôt work, had to stand in line. | Have used this app several times now and it saves us a significant amount of time. Instead of standing in line with a hundred other people we always go straight to a line of about five people and get through in less than 15 minutes. | No the global entry one got before me",4.58609,112024,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/60/a4/fd/60a4fd04-1286-091b-fda2-4099c9a25f38/9e6fc787-9706-4c69-8f82-3a2d6dca2cf3_Tile1_5.5_U0027_U0027.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0d/6c/a0/0d6ca057-0f2e-4bee-50bd-f82ace9bf79c/89c1805f-2ec5-4b96-82f6-6f13f01be9dc_Tile2_5.5_U0027_U0027.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f5/70/9f/f5709f78-3f39-ab2a-9897-4d4946ee9a9c/fdb87367-3514-42bd-8bdf-3cca3b872176_Tile1_12.9_U0027_U0027.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b4/1c/58/b41c58e1-38cb-b420-0aef-939b48c6b6d3/998d807c-9159-4631-8e3d-3f12cc72c2da_Tile2_12.9_U0027_U0027.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Don‚Äôt fall for it. | Very easy to track flight | Love this app , watching the planes move around . Kids are always asking dad  for my phone . | Spend more time viewing junk adds. Supposedly saved 4 flights, but can‚Äôt view them. Makes me go through the process again, and again, and again. I suppose if I subscribed to paying $40/year they might give me more to review. But if their free trial is any indication, it would be something of neverending frustration | The most accurate flight info I‚Äôve ever seen | This app has so many adds. Either you pay to get rid of the adds or you just stop using it. Horrible concept‚Ä¶to get paid. Considering alternative ways to get customers to pay. | Try Flight Aware better and free. | Misleading app, hard to use with out subscription | I‚Äôm loving being able to keep up with my children‚Äôs flight in their small plane. | Great app, but can you add a night mode. The white bright screen is annoying at night. | Great how it‚Äôs integrated with the airlines and gives accurate info in real time. Love it so far! | App of limited value outside continental US. | It‚Äôs an amazing app because it tells you when the planes are moving at what speed and altitude and I just got it to track my sisters flight but WOW!!! | It‚Äôs amazing how accurate it is. I see the plane on the map then go outside and it‚Äôs right there. Super cool app | It does cost money but you can press x to get out and you get to see planes round the world and it showes it like a gps would that makes it easy for you to go to places and you can go to airport and you can see planes around you. | Recently, searching for a flight or an airport is not returning results, showing an error message. | I just used this app for first time AND each time I try to type in a flight number or airport, nothing shows up, search just spins. So frustrating!!!! | To many add | Have been trying to cancel this for 2 months and they keep charging me. | This feels like a game to me and how much money do you actually have to spend on seats? | Love this app. | This is just a ripoff of flight radar 24 and this is the worst version of that | I cannot locate the flight of my loved ones like you promised!! | As soon as you give them your email which there is no way around it they immediately want you to subscribe. I‚Äôm guessing I will get a bunch of spam like always when you give out your email. I deleted app because of better options out there that are better and cheaper | I can follow my family flying!! Awesome ! ETA  and other things ‚Ä¶ have too many informations ! | I‚Äôm trying to find a please note the next day and the prints or not there. Hope they consist of this soonüòÄ | I use this app to keep me current on family travels - makes coordinating transportation so much more efficient. Very easy to use - intuitive.

I was confused because there was no information or email that told me that the flight was going back. So I decided to go download a BETTER app that told me the their flight was on track and not back at where it started. Based on the other reviews I have seen Im sure the company did this for money because everyone I try to open the app it showed me an add. 1/5 stars This app will never be on my phone. Thank you. | I like the app, but I can‚Äôt give it 5 stars cause it‚Äôs a pay app | Its the best i have ever used | This app will only work for free for 3 days if you subscribe, you have to remember to cancel before the 3 days is up or you are automatically billed.

I couldn‚Äôt see how to cancel it, so I had my wife do it and it shows the app canceled in one year rather than immediately and a refund was not given. There is no way to contact anyone to discuss this. | Don‚Äôt show route well | Every 3 clicks and it begs you to buy premium or shows an ad | Every click in the app prompts you to pay $6 per month | The app has become very bad. Routes are either interrupted or it shows that the plans are not even in the sky.
I used to like the app but very disappointed lately. | Set up and information details have been simple for a tech challenged person | I tried to cancel my subscription and it still charged me! | I would only use this once or twice a year and at $5.99 A WEEK- it is astronomical!

So don‚Äôt have any issues & this account might work for you | I downloaded the app and got a 200 dollar advance to help with some childcare expenses. In the week since I made about 60 bucks doing surveys and games on my commute. Basically covers my lunch every day. | Perfect site | I travel out of state every other week and Super.com has the cheapest hotel prices by far .  I belong to and have just about every app, membership and/or discounts I can find . Super.com beats them about 98% of the time . The other 2% maybe only 1-2 dollars off , even then it‚Äôs not bad , considering.  Yes , I recommend them 100% | We have searched different apps for hotel bookings but this is still the lowest price in comparison. Easy to book and reminder confirmation texts before the date approaches are a great feature. Very happy booking on this app! | I‚Äôve used Super.com multiple times for lodging and they we‚Äôre by far the least expensive. The site is well constructed so it‚Äôs easy to make bookings. The only recommendation that I would make is to increase the number of photos of the hotel room. Otherwise, I rate Super.com as the best booking site. I actually only booked through Super.com now. | Me and my friends booked a hotel at Manhattan. We booked it for 89$ through this app. When we arrived at the hotel, the confirmation number that Super provided is not accepted at the receiptionist. We tried calling the support team + urgent care team and they provided my with the new number and still does not work. We waited for THREE hours at the hotel. This app ruined my whole experience at New York City. | This was my first time using Super.com, and I must admit it was a wonderful experience excellent customer service support with quick response time. | Amazing! Very friendly! | Disgusting scam artists good luck trying to get your money back or contact anybody. | I downloaded app and booked hotel last minute. Did not realize I signed up for $14.99 monthly billing. 
I‚Äôve used app successfully in past since 2020, and in Jan 2024 booked and apparently signed up for membership since the day I booked my stay. 
It‚Äôs about 8 steps to cancel. Apparently one step to sign up. Just book hotel. 
Chat support said to go to website or app. 
Website said go to chat support. 
Phone number says to use chat. Got response that chat is unavailable. 
It‚Äôs no savings when you‚Äôre billed monthly. | I booked a hotel through Super and when I arrived to check in the hotel had no running water (broken pipes). There is no way to call Super for a refund in this situation, you have to use their chat app, which means waiting as long as 12 minutes in between responses from them. They said they were happy to assist with the problem, then 20+ minutes later (after asking me to repeat info I‚Äôd already told them) they said they could not issue a refund because they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot responsible for quality concerns.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how anyone thinks that a $185 hotel room with not running water is a ‚Äúquality concern.‚Äù

And Super, please don‚Äôt bother posting some inane ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry you were dissatisfied‚Äù response. You had the chance to fix it and didn‚Äôt. | I had to make a last minute trip. Usually they‚Äôre very expensive and I didn‚Äôt like the prices I saw on Google, but I was surprised to find Super‚Äôs rate at a well known hotel chain. What I like about them is they have their rate and the hotel resort fee upfront so you know what you‚Äôre expecting to pay. I called the hotel to confirm and am looking forward to my stay. | I have always used Super to book my stays.
Never had an issue until yesterday 3/17.

Yesterday I went to check in, to my surprise front desk told me that they had my reservation however the funds did not go through. I was very confused as I knew I had the funds. I pulled up my banking info and the front desk girl let me know it was not on my end, the funds were not received on their end from this service. I was charged for my room again from the hotel since they were unable to reach anyone. 
I was in disbelief as this has never happened to me. 
So in all I paid twice, once from super and the other time at the hotel since they didn‚Äôt get their payment from Super!

I been trying to look a number to dial for customer support and have not been successful. 
Do not recommend as this may happen. Yes, I know it was just once on my end but the front desk lady at the hotel said it happens all the time with this service. She‚Äôs seen it to many times. | So my issue is I did this for the advance as well as other perks it says money back guarantee if you don‚Äôt get the advance it takes your debit card info and make you pay as if you already know if your bank is accepted by them then next it says no 
cash app ,Dave , Albert ,Current , Money Lion
I don‚Äôt have any of those only to find out after they take my money my bank is not accepted here and I have no refund this is awful misinformation 
I WANT A REFUND AND I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL IT‚ÄôS RECEIVED 
The only reason I gave a 1 is cause I can not give a 0 | When I am on the road I use my Super app to book hotels and it definitely saves me time and money | This is a scam app. They charge you every month and when you cancel then they tell you that you can only call during certain time to cancel. It will not allow you to cancel membership on app. Do not download this | I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this company they‚Äôre very very slow at responding. They ask you to provide proof of pay statements and I did and they still said it‚Äôs not good enough. I recommend Albert and empower they support all banks and they respond fast and approval is way better | I got tge app they said you ca. win money dudnt know I had to pay them 15$ a month they never mentioned that. Then when I tried to delete the my account  on the app I had to  call them. Read the fine print. It‚Äôs not worth 15$ a month. | Booked Hotel great app best prices | I had never heard of this App until about 6 months ago and it came up in a Kayak search and they have consistently been the best price ever since. As I sai, it really works and I have been very happy with Super.com. | Every time I try to pay off my balance I get ars deline when my banks have money. I calle and got no help. Their is a glitch in there system with their app. Than when I don‚Äôt have money they try to take. Than I tried to change membership due date they will not let you. Also I have negative balance on cards try to take Money from. So o try to delete cards from their account and they will not let you. And they keep trying to take from all till they get their money. So do not add but the one card you are definitely going to use. By law they are supposed to let you delete cards from their app if you want because it is not their property or bank card. | I like it | Amazing staff and a comfortable overnight stay. | We booked a hotel through them and it was a non refundable. Well they did not communicate that there was an extra charge upon arrival at the desk. And it was high. When we confirmed it said after taxes and fees it was a curtain amount we confirmed. Once we got the confirmation email is when it stated there will be an extra charge when you arrive. We called they said we see you got a non refundable room and we said yes but this was not shown before check out they stated you have to have the hotel send us a letter stating they will approve the refund. I called hotel they said they would but super was supposed to be calling and requesting. Was on the phone for about 3 hours trying to resolve this issue. They have terrible customer service. I will never be using them again. I suggest no one use them. | I hadn‚Äôt used this company before so I was a little cautious. Super.com really came through providing better prices for hotels than other sites. | Both me and my sister in law have used Super Travel several times. | This app stuck | This was by and far one of the easiest travel companies to book with. They had amazing service when I needed to adjust the dates of my hotel!!! | Not much more to say, the app is slow.  Very very S L O W.  That being said, the prices are great. Used super many times and never had an issues. | Very affordable, clean, friendly staff.
Thank you Super.com. I was able to reserve what I needed in my car on the road. | Than most booking places! | Easy booking process. Great rates! | I got super + membership because there was a free trial. I‚Äôm now trying to cancel my subscription because the app is absolutely not worth 15$/month. The fact that the only way to cancel your subscription is through a call is not only ridiculous and no one on customer service is ever available. I have never in my life had to cancel through a phone call for a service like this. Definitely fishy and there should  100% a be a more accessible way to cancel. If i didn‚Äôt have to talk to customer service to get my subscription, I shouldn‚Äôt have to call customer service to cancel. | If you're looking for a travel website that will leave you stranded, frustrated, and out of pocket, then look no further than Super.com! In my recent experience, they were the absolute worst.

They booked a hotel room for me, took my money with glee, then did the absolute worst part - they didn't actually reserve the room! When I arrived, exhausted and ready to check in, the hotel had no record of my reservation. There were simply no rooms available.

So, there I was, stranded thanks to Super.com's incompetence. The hotel pointed me back to their website to get a refund, which only added insult to injury. Super.com's fantastic customer service then proceeded to blame me somehow for their mistake and refused to refund my money!

Let me be perfectly clear: Super.com is not your friend.  They are an unreliable, unhelpful, and frankly, a dishonest company.  Do not use them!  Take your business elsewhere, anywhere else,  and avoid the Super.com nightmare.

Unless you enjoy being stranded, wasting your money, and dealing with terrible customer service, then stay far, far away from Super.com. | I have now used Super over my usual travel apps for the third time. I‚Äôve found better discounted rates and the process has been extremely easy. | I have been waiting for weeks for this company to approve my account every time i aske about it im told they will send it to their hq team i had Paul Alvin as my super supporter who had no information and refused to do anything i hope in the future they fix their problems but i wont be recommending anyone to use it | Run! Don‚Äôt book with them. It is a scam and they will just take your money and lie about any support or customer advocacy. | This company has the worst customer service ever. I‚Äôve contacted them numerous times about fraudulent charges on my account with no positive outcome. My card was used in another country and no customer support. It‚Äôs been weeks !!!!! PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE. !!!!!! | it‚Äôs all a scam! they will pay out the lower dollar amounts but when it comes to the big pay outs, they look the other way.  or claim you didn‚Äôt do something right.  and worst customer service!! | Never been so heartbroken and disappointed in an app before. I‚Äôm a member of super.com and pay for a monthly membership, which I‚Äôll be canceling after this review. I was using the  ‚Äúplay for cash‚Äù feature where you download games and complete tasks for rewards. It took me almost 2 months to complete these 2 particular tasks. Finally completed it, never got rewards for it. Submitted a ‚Äúmissing points‚Äù ticket & submitted proof of completion within the super app.. 
I get an error message saying to contact the company that handles the gaming feature (adgatemedia).. They tell me I‚Äôm out of luck on the rewards I earned & to not use third party apps like super for gaming.
Lastly I return back to the super app, just to now be banned from playing any games for rewards. I contact support asking why am I banned and in violation of terms? There response was once your banned.. it‚Äôs permanent. So even though it was just a $10.45 reward, and a $4.65 reward that I earned which isn‚Äôt much to some people .. as a single mom, that was help toward gas to get to work. After this review, I doubt I‚Äôll get a developer response on here.. and if I do, there‚Äôs nothing support or corporate can do to credit me anyway so I‚Äôm out of luck. This was so disheartening  and I really truly did love this app for the year I was on it. I was in good standing and referred many to it. | I had a last minute cancellation of an event. 
When I tried to contact a live person I got nowhere. Same run around and same recording. Will not ever use this service again | Great app, hit or miss sometimes but great discount deals! | I used this app for a while because I travel frequently and was lured in by the low prices and cash back aspect. My first few bookings I had no real issue and became a Super+ member thinking I‚Äôd found something great! I had a family emergency cause me to cancel a booking and the hotel waived any fees and cancelled free of charge for me. I contacted Super customer service several days in the row spent hours in chats and on the phone with them. They have continually told me to wait on a call back that never comes. Every customer service agent I speak with tell me I must get confirmation from the hotel which I did THE VERY FIRST DAY!!! I have repeatedly sent them the cancellation; I have called the hotel and spoken directly to a manager about if there is anything further I can do and been told NO. It has been over a week of going in circles with this company even after they have admitted they are holding my funds and nothing was ever received by the hotel! | Hotel is in the center of town and easily walkable with many shops and restaurants nearby.You cannot park in front as driving is restricted but you can pull up and unload your car. Rooms are very spacious and simply appointed. Beds were comfortable and we enjoyed that breakfast was included. | I just finished up an amazing stay at Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass, thanks fully to Super - lowest prices I could find which then may this high end property an option for me. Thank you!! | This is a very good app for booking hotels

Couchsurfing is a better deal for the social aspect alone. Deleted app. | Lots of horny people and scammers. I don‚Äôt know what it is made for,it‚Äôs a meaningless app that can only waste my time. | Worst app ever, I subscribed while checking out premium plan, I cancelled instantly and requested a refund but none was approved. App is full of scammers don‚Äôt make same mistake I did. Quit app!!! | I hate it | The concept is fun, but the app lacks a lot of polish, especially with the algorithm. At first you get some matches, probably to keep you on the app. But then you get to watch your ‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù number of swipe rights build up (people waiting for you to also swipe right on them). Below 100, you can see the exact number of ‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù people increase or decrease with your swipes. And I could swipe for an hour with 70 potential matches, and get 0 matches and maybe the number will decrease to 68. That means I was shown maybe 2 matches in an hour. An hour is a LOT of swiping. That means they‚Äôre holding all of those potential matches behind a paywall, when they could easily be rotating some of them in the cycle. Once the ‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù is stuck at ‚Äú99+‚Äù, it will stay that way forever, and you‚Äôll just be getting ghost notifications that mean nothing and swiping for hours with no results. It‚Äôs just depressing to have to pay $9/mo for the opportunity to start a conversation, many of which will die out quickly. There‚Äôs also many bots, scams, and abandoned accounts that add to the feeling of swiping into the void, doing nothing productive. Wasted potential with what could be a super popular app. | Needs a system to verify the fake profiles from the real ones.  There‚Äôs definitely potential with this app but finding real people came be really difficult at times because I‚Äôll end up talking to someone for a period of time who ends up not being real. | Please be careful! I totally felt bad for this Paul Simon üòÇ

OIL RIG SCAMMERS HAVE A SCRIPT THAT WILL FOLLOW OR AT LEAST RESEMBLE THIS:
ÔªøÔªøÔªøDivorced (cheating) or wife died in child birth, serious illness or terrible accident
ÔªøÔªøÔªøHas young child/children staying with family, a nanny or in boarding school
ÔªøÔªøÔªøBorn in one country but raised in another country and often living in yet another country
ÔªøÔªøÔªøBoth parents, whether living or dead, are from two different countries
ÔªøÔªøÔªøBank account is frozen for a variety of different reasons
ÔªøÔªøÔªøCan't video chat due to security or regulations Those on an oil rig will often claim that the phone signal may trigger an explosion, yet they're using that phone to message you.
ÔªøÔªøÔªøOil Rig ""workers"" will always claim they have to personally replace equipment, PAY FOR MEALS, get internet, or upgrade their computer, but can't access their bank account to pay for it so you have to help them do so, generally by asking for gift cards.
ÔªøÔªøÔªøOil Rig ""workers"" will also have some disaster strike like a serious injury to themselves or a co-worker. Then they will need payment for a helicopter to get them off the rig or to pay for medical care before they will be allowed to leave the rig. | I love itt | I dont want to pay | good | Nice | So, one thing I don‚Äôt like about the app is that‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt allow me to go back through the options, once you scroll through everyone in the country it just stops basically. It‚Äôd be a lot cooler if I was able to go back through them, less boring and restrictive anyways. | So I been a user of this app for a while. I enjoyed it so much but a couple of months ago I woke up to find out I got banned for no reason. The developers didn‚Äôt even let me know why I was banned. I even reached out via email and never got a reply. Just cause the app was decent I decide to give it a two star. | No one is on this app. If you want to get catfished by weirdos in Turkey, this is the app for you. I paid the 8.99 to upgrade for a month out of curiosity and I can spare the 8.99 and I still want my money back. Find any other international app, this is just bots, creeps and crypto | Most of the profiles are fake. Full of scammers named Douglas Chang and Beom Seok. Do NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP. They will love bomb and then start mentioning money. They are mostly talking about contracts and DONT GET INVOLVED IN BITCOIN. There social media is always on facebook and it only goes as far back as a couple of months. So please don‚Äôt fall for this app or the scammers. | Almost all the people on it are fake . Either they are using someone else‚Äôs picture or are there for the wrong reasons. They are there for money or some kind of scam. | Can‚Äôt do anything unless you pay monthly for premium | To be honest I had this app for a long time and I haven‚Äôt gotten connected to people and it also says that you have to pay to connect with people and I don‚Äôt want to pay to connected with people | Too many Chinese bots hiding behind profiles spamming and harassing you for your personal information | I don‚Äôt get matched with people whom I like ü•≤üòÇ | i think its dumb how despite the point of the app is to meet new people, you have to pay for it. | The app is so laggy that it‚Äôs almost impossible to use, also there are lots of fake profiles so it‚Äôs very hard to find people to talk to | I can‚Äôt open the app on my IPhone | I was told I had a message but everything on the app is completely blank and most people don‚Äôt really respond on here anyways so I was surprised about any messages?? | So far I like this app but it would be a lot better if you could send a message to someone directly that you want to talk to. There‚Äôs been people I‚Äôve seen who share my interests but i couldnt send them a message unless they swipe to talk to me. | Tried premium for a month. Found only scammers. Not a single genuine encounter. | you have to get premium to see ppl who have like your profile, so how are you supposed to start conversations with people? | Glitchy app, filled with only fake profiles | Fun if you're 16, probably. Not for adults. | I can‚Äôt message it‚Äôs a mess | Displays my last name with no way to edit it and you can't even use the app without paying for premium. | Most people add their social media profiles to their bio because you can‚Äôt really chat without paying for premium. Even when you do swipe to talk to someone you can‚Äôt go back and look at it about having premium. Premium is only 899 but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it for an app that may be full of fake profiles‚Ä¶.. | Its a very nice app but only for premium users. Its a useless app for a free user. Not everyone could afford to pay. | Why do we have to have premium to see who wants to be friends. That to me is very boring.. What‚Äôs even the point of the app?? | This app is full of people that! Wishes to be a Insta star but this app app is FOR MAKING FRIENDS! Not for insta WannaBE‚Äôs ! Please look to Hinge! Hinge is Better if you see to hinge! Let me tell you that is the BEST! Way you should create this app! Also get rid for free of Unactive Profiles!! 0 NO MORE put a Condition that UNACTIVE PROFILES WILL BE ERASED!! | They only want you to pay and once you paid they never show you people, don‚Äôt lose your money! | Somewhere during registration for this app my last name was included in my username. I can‚Äôt edit my name and I‚Äôve tried numerous times to delete the account. I reached out through their very limited help page and no response. | The app doesn‚Äôt let you report people that fake but just to report them as bad behavior. | Worst app I seen, you can‚Äôt use ANY FEATURES. They all lock behind a paywall, I can‚Äôt even experience the app and you think I‚Äôm finna sub? Lol yeah ok lol | I like this app but it need more upgrades and reduce the price of subscription | Well That was a huge waste of 2 hours. | I truly believe 99% of profiles here are fake. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. You cannot meet a real person on this app, the majority is using fake photos and the other half is trying to scam you out of crypto. | Ok, so I like how this app allows people to meet others around the world to make international friends or find more people who are like you. But what I don‚Äôt like is how when you have someone who swiped right (wants to chat) on you, you have to PAY for a premium membership to see who wants to chat with you along with chatting with others too. Also I don‚Äôt like how if someone uses an inappropriate profile picture, and you report it, nothing happens. Another concern is that sometimes the nationalities you want to search for to be friends with sometimes just runs out. Lastly, I don‚Äôt like how there isn‚Äôt like an undo button (maybe that‚Äôs just me in my opinion) like if I swiped left accidentally, there‚Äôs no undo. But overall I guess it‚Äôs nice, not amazing, but nice. | Too many catfish ‚Äúfrom Malaysia‚Äù or Singapore. ‚ÄúDo you have WhatsApp‚Äù as an opener usually means scam. | Paid for premium. App continually crashes. Can‚Äôt change name or gender. Matches you with people your aren‚Äôt looking for. I‚Äôm shocked this app got the rating it did. I‚Äôm out $9 for an app I can‚Äôt even use. There should be a refund policy. | The only sign in options are with Apple or Facebook and the app does not let you change your name. | I wish we could chat with people without having to pay for the premium. But, overall I think the app is ok. | this app is full of fakes. don‚Äôt download it. | I came on this app to make friends from other countries and most of these people are predators and only look for sex. They are VERY rude and have sex traffickers on there . I got stalked from a man i met on this app and we have never met . I caught him outside my house all because i matched him but didnt message. Because of this app, i almost got kidnapped! I DONT recommend at all | All the people I met in this app are scammers trying to put their code in your Crypto Wallet multiple people from China trying to steal your money.  I had names, text, phone and WhatsApp information if you want to clean your pathetic app",4.47369,5778,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/19/56/f8/1956f84a-61f8-2333-0706-7dd6a31147e2/mzl.pwecyire.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6d/82/a9/6d82a92d-1f2b-0bb7-b798-d7ce4e876774/f688e155-4e49-4b56-babe-db0d3a43e75d_2-2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/77/f5/25/77f525ad-d52d-364b-0951-8d91d4a81bf5/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/2b/32/8d/2b328db2-98a0-f94c-9d4e-f29c3850e80e/mzl.rdnwghnx.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/11/14/48/1114488a-108c-2182-004a-ddd295fc311c/mzl.lfahfswg.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/98/3c/5a/983c5a80-eba7-630b-5f67-6985789ed12b/682eb8ae-a059-442e-a23b-e3d9dca36f2c_ipad1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/29/63/9a/29639af1-a576-c6dc-34c3-3020860a5e22/be5cf012-1e8b-400e-ab33-e7a2fbb25728_ipad2.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The Pogo Team","7.1.3",0,"USD",true,1470248251,"Pogo Travel Ltd","https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/pogo-travel-ltd/id1470248251?uo=4","https://pogo.travel/",4.78864,"I‚Äôve tested out a couple of different trip planning apps and I really like the idea of Pogo the best so far, but I‚Äôve been playing around with it for about 10 min and have had to close it out and reopen at least 5 times because it freezes. Has a lot of potential, but definitely needs work! Hope it improves quickly! | I love and miss the layout and design of pluto i was obsessed! But pogo is good as well! I love the detail and i love planning trips with this app! | The idea is there and I love the search and find option but the app is slow and anytime I click to view a category the app freezes or restarts. You‚Äôd think that exiting the app would fix that problem, but it‚Äôs just rinse and repeat and still freezes when trying to view the categories. Which really makes it more hassle than what it‚Äôs worth. | THE REBRAND IS SO BAD, I‚Äôm devastated. Pluto was one of my favorite apps and I can‚Äôt stand using the new version. The old branding was unique, beautiful and had character, not to mention the usability and functionality was also amazing. Was this rebrand tested with literally any users?? It could not have gotten positive responses. | Sorry, but the new branding is horrendous. I LOVED the old Pluto, and had it proudly on my home screen. The new logo, name, everything is so awful I‚Äôm tempted to delete the app altogether. I know rebranding takes time, effort, and money, but this was not the way to go, in my honest opinion. It feels like a cheap imitation of a popular social app, instead of embracing the unique beauty that was the old app. | I am not sure how this app received so many great reviews. It was very difficult to navigate. the flow didn‚Äôt make sense. I just was not impressed overall. | Tbh I never write reviews especially for an APP üíÄBUT I‚Äôm planning a road trip soon and super exited so I wanted something to help keep me organized ‚ú®it‚Äôs actually pretty good and cute and neat it‚Äôs like Pinterest in a way . I‚Äôm not a bot either :) thanks Pluto ! | The aesthetic of this app is incredible. 

One HUGE thing I wish it had is an actual
itinerary in date/time order. You can save everything in this app but it won‚Äôt show you a timeline like other travel apps do. 
Add that and a widget for your home screen, and I wouldn‚Äôt need any other app for travel. 

Unfortunately right now it doesn‚Äôt work 100% alone for me, I still use TripIt for the itinerary timeline feature. | I was looking for an app that would allow me to collaborate trip ideas with my friends. With very few reviews, I was uncertain, but decided to give Pluto a try and I‚Äôm so glad I did! 
So far the user experience is top notch. The app is running very smoothly, no lags or glitches. It‚Äôs very intuitive and user-friendly, and in minutes I was easily able to navigate myself around, start a trip and invite my friend to collaborate. 
A few suggestions:
When initially walking through the first steps, I would like to be able to pick a region to travel, not just a specific state or city. For instance, I wanted to be able to say Pacific Northwest, but that wasn‚Äôt an option. Also, I would like to be able to create my own categories within the trip. 

Solid five stars for usability and of course that it‚Äôs free. | i‚Äôve been on the hunt for a travel/itinerary app that was easy on the eyes and incredibly user friendly! | I normally look at Pinterest or YouTube to look up things to do. I love that they already have popular things to try. | Awesome app for planning our holiday! there were lots of things I look for - but until now, I haven‚Äôt seen them all in one place. 
The app is very easy to use. You can also save ideas and places to eat. 
And also it served you up inspiration from the app‚Äôs recommendations. Top marks! | This app is off to a great start, they definitely have more to add, but I‚Äôm enjoying the flexibility and functionality they have now. It‚Äôs allowed me to share the plan with my friends and family going on a trip together. Also it allowed us to collaborate on the plan so that everyone has input on what we are doing on the trip so no one feels left out. | The app crashes as soon as you open it",4.78864,440,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2b/ae/ee/2baeee35-400f-691a-338f-212f45d36e55/4a1510bf-e8c4-418f-9632-8e5307164337_Pinboard_-_Slide_1_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/45/c6/49/45c649bc-0fb6-266d-6c63-704dd14f8ab2/463904db-0c02-400a-8a6a-89fc962cee89_MapView2_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6a/f7/c0/6af7c04f-56b9-43fb-d2d1-66e8e14156bc/e74af584-e6e7-4c33-93f7-2b7f31fef97f_Stays_-_Slide_3_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/00/f1/cb/00f1cbe0-ad83-14aa-e8ce-0f2bd9ba786e/ba7467e5-66e1-45d6-92a5-1368ce83c289_Recommend_-_Slide_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/53/b2/89/53b28973-0ba8-a4d2-c6da-7cd49f2f2022/a063b10a-0b5c-49d1-a356-3cfa24810af6_Reviews_-_Slide_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

When I try to log in to my account from gaia 
It doesn‚Äôt work | Good game | Just started but they want review so here it is | I‚Äôm they also made lost linage and elorias raid both no longer online or working I can‚Äôt even tell you how much they refuse to refund as well for both after shut down. The games are fun but beware it won‚Äôt be here in a year or so!!!!! | This game is terrible. 3 crappy classes, no customization, terrible voice acting. Very robotic. Don‚Äôt waste your time. | Magnifico juego recomendado para todas las personas | Please add controller support for this game so people can use any controllers for it | Cool game | I regretfully spent a lot of money on this stupid game. I enjoyed the game play for a while. That all lasted way too short. They merged the servers due to their greed. The server died and everyone left. All the money I spent on that server and character is now a HUGE waste. There only response to my complaint is all transactions are final. This trash company cares about one thing and that is stealing your money. Move on from the game it‚Äôs a money pit of thieves. I wish I could say worse but I know that if I do the review won‚Äôt be posted. | I lost my account while logging in with my Apple ID and can‚Äôt get into my Kaguya account. I gave this 5 stars because the game is all and all very good. But I would like if the developers can help me get my account back | My characters I spent money on disappeared from my account | I love the game it has such a great open community and lots of things to offer. But sometimes when play certain servers not a lot of people talk or play on a certain server so what if you add C.S marriage And merge servers together so there is no separation. But other than that 9.8/10 | Not a BAD game, after level 200 you‚Äôll realize that its just another pay-to-win game. Not a great game but it isn't terrible either. The people online aren‚Äôt toxic, and are actually quite nice. So it at least has a good community and pretty decent graphics. | I‚Äôm on iPhone 13 pro max so maybe because of that the part of the screen is cut out please fix asap | Are they‚Äôre guys in this game I can customize as? That‚Äôs just what I want to know before I download this üòê | When I registered an account and pressed ‚Äústart adventure‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt even let me in the game | does it cover apple pay? | Something wrong every time when I want to open the game it says erro with my network I deleted the game and I download it again it‚Äôs the same can you fix this bug !? It happens with me to many times | Gg | I purchase y‚Äôall massive sale for a mount 3.99 in the spirit for 0.99$  in the other spirit for 5.99$ in guess what I didn‚Äôt get neither my stuff in I always supporting this game -_- either I get my items of I‚Äôm disputing this charge | Great game have been having tons of fun. Abit overwhelming at first but you get used to it rather quickly.

I do have one major issue however,
My server has just started cross server pvp and we are only a week old. Which would be fine, however they pair us with servers that are several months old. 

For comparison the top rank player in my server is 30m+ cp which is higher then the previous servers number 1. Yet we are being ranked against players with 300m+ cp.

This imo is a huge issue, in an event I would normally rank top 10 I am no longer even on leaderboards and therefore receive very little to no rewards. Instead these rewards go to the already very large players who have had months of play time on me.

Essentially what you are doing is catering to your giants at the expense of new players, which I do not think is a very good idea. Either limit cross server to within reasonable cp differences or rework your ranking system (ie. during cross server ur ranked based off of overall rank and only server rank). | Don‚Äôt try. It‚Äôs a pay to win game. Graphics and bugs are still horrible despite of reminding the admins to fix them. You don‚Äôt have a voice here as a player. | I‚Äôve played this game for about a week now and it‚Äôs brought me a lot of joy so far! It is a standard J-rpg of its type, mechanics and features wise, but it shines in terms of absolutely beautiful graphics, fun characters, exciting environments, adorable pets, and gorgeous mounts. Highly recommend for anyone who appreciates a good mmo with a bright, cheerful aesthetic!

To the devs and support team, I apologize for being misinformed regarding some of your game‚Äôs features, and very much appreciate you swift and friendly response! | Nice game I love it op skills love how you can just go back and change characters also once your a good level your just so op not even bosses can kill you otherwise | The developers only care about money and heavy paying players. They don‚Äôt respond to any inquiries and doesn‚Äôt update the game at all so it gets repetitive and boring fast. ALL EyouGames are the same so I suggest you save your time and money and play literally anything else. | This game is  just a way for a foreign company to make a quick buck from people with fomo. If you want to compete with other players be prepared to drop at least 100 dollars. | So much fighting and so ez to lvl up! | level 1 through ~200+ goes by really fast. its a lot of information to take in. do not let that get you down. the game will eventually slow down enough for you to start to comprehend what is going on and how to actually play the game. once it does, you realize the reason it seems like a lot, is because it actually has a lot of content. everything i personally loved about about other mmo's i've played is all here in one game! also, YES everything can be auto'd but the game rewards those who actually play and spend time on the game. 

extra side note: also, for those who don't want to commit too much time, the offline progression system is earned by playing the game and lasts way longer than your standard 3 hour cap on other games. i've earned up to about 80 hours of offline farming if i really need to. | This game is amazing to play with friends. | There is no cutscenes. Not enough story on the beginning of the play through. | Soon as you start the game it looks like it‚Äôs the best game to get a kill monsters and you also get to do quiz so yeah everyone who sees this please get this game it‚Äôs the best I really recommend it | i like the game in all but they should make it so you can import your .vrm or vroid characters because then you can just use that and show everyone what you made or just have a random character that someone else made | This is the most P2W game I‚Äôve ever downloaded.
Your strength is literally a number that scales so quickly that someone 5-10 levels ahead of you will mow you down, no skill involved.
Only 3 character choices with almost no customization involved.
Same quests every day, mostly auto run.
Essentially an idle rpg with no strategy.
Would not recommend to anyone. | I‚Äôve played this game for close to a month and I love it. 

However, I am reaching the end of what I can do without paying into the game. Can you play for free? Absolutely! Can you max out rank and CP to enjoy all the game extras? Probably not! So unless you enjoy being slaughtered by higher ranks the game quickly becomes frustrating, if not unplayable. 

In game there is a VIP4 pass that‚Äôll cost you roughly $30 to unlock (for 6 months) that will allow for some extra bonuses, but there‚Äôs heavy emphasis to buy‚Äînot earn‚Äîthe rest of your progress. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a casual game with a great auto function that‚Äôs rewarding early on? It‚Äôs great. 

Long term; be prepared to pay in, or be disappointed and eventually uninstall. | Unable to save character from guest account to bind account.

Also idk how to feel about the english spoken in this game by the npc | The fact that the app seems to crash randomly from time to time has caused me to lose out on things. | Fills events with bots who auto get first place to make you spend more, lies about fusing rates 5% fails  constantly. They only want your money, gameplay is literal garbage. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. | I got to lv 238 then my data got wiped this is a great game | It‚Äôs the best game ever it has monsters you get tag it‚Äôs the best | There is a lot of inactive players in my server. Only at least 10 people max in the server that goes online. Only time i am able to communicate to others is when they finally open League. 

I develop a nice communication with people but i wish i was in their server since they have active guild. I invested so much time and money for this game because it has potential.

I believe you guys are able to make this happen knowing how well develop this game is and the events as on point amazing and entertaining! So i am giving it a 4 star. I‚Äôll continue to support you guys by investing more towards the game. Keep making these good content and event. It‚Äôs a pay to win game so people should already expect that money involves in this game so that‚Äôs fine. 

How else would they make a good game content if everything is free?? 

All i ask is merge those server or a way i can able to interact socially with my friends in another server and i do not have to be lonely on my own on my server. Also, I got someone i like in another server and i really want to be with him! :) please support | Game is lag in pc | The game start to glitch
My level not going up | So cool | Ncjfkkkaskd | Game was fun, I enjoyed it at first. I have more experience with games so I understood what was happening while the game was rushing you to lvl200 or so. But when the rushing stopped, it completely stopped. You can do your daily quest and dungeons in about 30minutes then you basically have nothing else to do and there‚Äôs no point in playing until the next day. If grinding mobs or manual play was more rewarding for anything especially experience then the game wouldn‚Äôt burn out in a couple days. | pretty cool. just wish i could bind my phone | Keeps saying I have network issues.. | Your character is a cookie cutter image of every other player for the whole game which makes it bland | Easy controls cool animations and characters | Was playing for a week straight made lvl 350 10m CP and my account stop working. I‚Äôve sent countless of messages to the support team about my account. Last night I was playing then I woke up the next morning to long on and a whole new lancer lvl 3 character was that was not the character I spent at least $100+ on did not show up.

Most recent trip last week, the map went blank. All saved places still there but no streets or saved stars show up in the screen. Is anyone else experiencing this and would someone please help me troubleshoot this? | We really appreciated this app as a handy tool on our trip to Paris and highly recommend it to others for their journeys! | Nice app. It would nice if I could share or export this to my wife‚Äôs phone AND when I have a category.. for example‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúMarkets‚Äù, when I click on the map to locate that market, the map only show the markets I have saved and not all the other point of interests I‚Äôve saved in other categories. | I used to love this app, but now‚Ä¶ The search function is terrible, and the Metro map outdated. It doesn‚Äôt even list the RER C line, which is kind of a big deal. And if you search for ‚Äúnotre‚Äù or  ‚Äúnotre dame‚Äù, you get no results. Need to type ‚Äúnotre-dame‚Äù to find anything. No longer my go-to app for Paris. | This App has helped us present our vaccination status while traveling throughout Europe. The convenience of having the entire family in just a couple of swipes. Although it‚Äôs good to have your original record as backups (never had to use) this is the recognized solution while traveling in many places throughout Western Europe. | I found this app for my second, and his first trip to one of the most beautiful places in the world. As I did my research, I bookmarked all the landmarks, restaurants, cafes, gardens, hidden passages and patisseries that looked interesting, with notes and links to the review or menu. It was so helpful as we wandered the city, to look at the app to find, ‚Äúhey, we‚Äôre just around the corner from‚Ä¶‚Äù I told so many people about it. 

Now, 2 years later, as we plan another trip, it seems buggy. The map keeps disappearing. I go to see a location I pinned, and nothing. I uninstalled the app and readdded it and it worked for a while, but is broken again. We leave in a week. I hope it works. | I love this app because I am going to Paris in 3 or 4 years with my gramma so we are in the middle of planning the trip so I love your app because it helps me be organized.

We used it the entire time we were in Paris since it gave me real-time gps walking/navigation location so I could figure out directions - offline. Seriously, this app was a LIFE SAVER! We intended on using the Metro during most of our stay, which this app also give ‚Äúclosest metro stops‚Äù to sites, however with the strikes going on we basically walked the city. We couldn‚Äôt have done it without the help of this app. Before our trip I downloaded it & starred/saved all our points of interest we planned on visiting. While we were in Paris, I remained offline -didn‚Äôt use my data - and this app was still able to locate me on the map. Thank you for this app!! | Awesome app, clearly was a great guide to us for being here as first time visitors, I strongly recommend for all who plan to visit Paris , this app was a good guide in pointing out the key popular sites, that you have to see in Paris 
We also learn to move on Metro, train  and bus. To the different cafes,  restaurants | The map feature was awesome! | My whole week in Paris depends on it! | Above | User Friendky Detailed , Easy , Accurate. | This app is going to save my time in my next trips. I‚Äôm preparing my route and planning every day to use when I‚Äôm there. Thank you! | Outstanding resource as we navigated Paris without data. | We used this app CONSTANTLY to find all the sites, shops, record stores and parks we wanted to see. Very easy to use and no bugs found yet! AAA+ | The app really helped me find my way around. | Best App for travel. I‚Äôm able to navigate to wherever I want to go and don‚Äôt have to use my expensive data plan. | Great app | I relied on this during my trip to Paris and it helped me to successfully navigate the city.  Thanks! | Great | This is an easy to use app that works well. Definitely top notch. | Helps locate and highlight all the places we want to see! | Loved the app!!! It was so easy to use. While in Paris it worked amazing!! We were able to find our way around Paris with no trouble at all!!! | Very helpful for getting around Paris | I live the Maps2Go App for offline use and the good source of hotels and restaurants.  It would be better if you could add a search feature using the Map instead of just getting a list. | Thanks for the great map! | I loved this app for years. It has all of Paris, not just the tourist parts. But somewhere in the last update, it seems to have added pop up ads, even though it‚Äôs an app I bought. My phone screen is small as it is, and I‚Äôm very disappointed the ads are now permanently on the map. | Back in the day, you carried a little red map book to get around Paris. Now, you just whip out this app and you‚Äôre unlost. Nostalgia is good, but knowing where you‚Äôre going is better. | Uses are many and it‚Äôs free. Maps,subway map. Prior version seemed easier to search places and addresses but it‚Äôs my go to downloadable map with flagged locals I choose before traveling. | Download to be used offline and never get lost.   Nice to have the metro included. | Ease of use ! | Easy to use & addictive in a good way | Had a wonderful experience and terrific food. Nice and great service. | Love this app | I travel with a smartphone and an iPad. When I have network connection, it is very useful to have a precise map already loaded. | I do t know his we could have got through Paris without this app!!!  Both in planning before hand and finding and going while in Paris, this app was essential to finding and learning about the many wonderful things Paris has to offer. | If you don't pay don't bother | This app consistently fails to download offlline content. So the number one reason you would want to use this app is also the number one reason it doesn't work. It's a good start but that needs to be fixed. | Paris, FR used for anniversary trip in June 2017. Very helpful for locating streets as we moved about in Paris for 2 weeks. | Used this app in Paris, it worked very good offline what helped me to find my location in the city easily. I like the option that I could find any sightsee being offline :) thanks | This app gives you the ability to locate where you are and where you need to go with a simple touch of the finger. It also tells you where the Metro is located and what cafes and restaurants and monuments are nearby. Indispensable! | If you are going to visit Paris (and surrounding areas) then you need this app! 
So basically, you get a map that looks a lot like Google Maps. It's complete with locations, road names, and even the entire metro system which was extremely useful for me! 
You are also able to create a ""list"" of restaurants, attractions, custom locations, etc, and save it all so that you know exactly where you're going in advanced. 
My ONLY problem with this app is that it won't show you turn by turn directions which shouldn't be an issue if you're good with directions.
It also gives you recommendations of places to check out based on categories you can choose from like night clubs, shopping, the best food, and stuff like that. 
All in all, I heavily relied on this app during my week in Paris (It was literally my bible) and I couldn't have been happier with how it turned out. It didn't drain my battery either! Thank you to the creators, I truly love this app. 

PS: if you ever get lost, your smart phone should still show your gps location on the maps app even without service. It should be easy to use this app once you find yourself. 
Also, the metros will take you to almost every landmark in Paris with minimal walking so I'd invest in a ""carnet"" of 10 tickets at the metro. | Super nice I can plan my future trip to Paris. It‚Äôs super cool that you can make lists and notes I really like it.
 All of this app is free and it shows what the price is for Hotels in Paris 
I recommend this app if you want to go to Paris someday. | Going to apple or google maps part needs to be online. If you use the show map, gps works to show your current position and help get to your destination. | We downloaded everything ahead of time and I was able to tour around Paris without WiFi. I wish every major city has such a tool. | Excellent Paris app tres non | I have used it several times on trips to Paris and it works like a charm!  Map and destinations all in the same place!  5 stars.  It would great to have more colors than are presently available for destinations in the lists. | This made my trip to Paris way easier to navigate.",4.70381,341,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/20/db/3d/20db3d72-2d2d-b935-5582-78fca14c4fcd/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ed/4c/4d/ed4c4dee-222c-ff41-3c26-95083d37c8e2/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/5e/1e/1d/5e1e1db8-98ae-da47-c624-37690d343edf/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/06/7f/d8/067fd88d-bb57-7479-44f3-f1d45088671a/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/80/76/71/80767150-7a66-b2f8-2e6c-2f4da7295996/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/0d/9b/bf/0d9bbf8e-e287-8e86-5c39-c3c4620155af/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/4d/31/8d/4d318d19-d737-dcdd-7fbf-d302fafbe417/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/5f/a6/ad/5fa6ade9-2958-27b9-d265-beebda9dae58/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/cf/d1/63/cfd163d9-5cb1-f8d1-db62-6be665ead134/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/b9/36/c6/b936c691-bd67-78a4-f478-35cea16f963b/pr_source.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I purchased one month to try it out and that was a mistake. Instead of NorthCarolina, it gave me Houston. I would like my money back.  I used it for 15 mins. and got entirely frustrated with all the inaccurate locations. | I was led to think this app would help me choose a destination, but you already need to know your destination, and your dates before you can even begin to search. No help at all. | A very cool concept for an app but it wasn‚Äôt working for me. I was trying to plan a 10 day trip to Denver with normal spending and a variety of interest. All the app showed me was a few dinky, city parks and a cowboy museum‚Ä¶for Denver, Colorado. Every time I tried to proceed the app encountered an error and then I couldn‚Äôt proceed. | I love this app because is simple and clear but I like to get more free AI features. | This app is really hard and useless. I need some customization. Save button on iOS is almost impossible. I can not add activities to the desired time because it collides with others. One example, I have an activity set for 5 hours (this time was added automatically) because I can not update duration even it it says ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. I can not add activity because time match with the 5 hours one.

I would like my money back | I used this to try and plan a family trip to Honolulu; however the content it gives despite changing parameters is very subpar. I would like for the app to regenerate other items if you delete from the itinerary. It‚Äôs a cool concept but still lacks in execution. Got frustrated with the app and deleted it. It makes you pay $4 to use it; not much but still disappointed with it. | Very nice app | Need very specific info on travel . Can use the internet much easier . Airfare and hotels . | I was planning a trip to San Francisco and wanted some good recommendations for my trip with my spouse. The app asks you detailed questions about what you are looking for but when given the results, it doesn‚Äôt seem like it accurately recommends based on your selections. When adjusting my selections, it gave me the exact same itinerary. It‚Äôs unfortunate that I had to pay for this experience but at least it was only around $4. | Makes you pay $5 before you can even use it and generated ‚Äúerror status 500‚Äù every single time i tried to create an itinerary. Waste of almost $5 for literally nothing. | They ruined the app after obliging you to pay even though last weeks there were some major cities for free and now u need to pay | Unless you are going to a major city, don‚Äôt pay for this. It‚Äôs idea of relaxing, nature and adventure was a tour of playgrounds for me. | I can‚Äôt believe Mexico City is not included in this app. | Cant even open it :( | So beautiful app | Not let me add more trips. Only the first one. | My initial usage was good | They are not ready to lounge the app. It has less than 10 cities . | Wow this app is amazing! The auto mapping made planning my Paris trip so much easier. I loved the recommendations too | I think the app is great‚Ä¶ perfect for travel and it really is super well designed but there are still many countries and cities to add üò≠ | Just downloaded, went to find suggestions for my next trip and 3 out of 3 cities I searched didn't have suggestions. Deleting app | Crashed 2 times when tried to build an itinerary | When I click on the images I am unable to close it. The X on the top right shows but does nothing. I have to close the app and start again. | I just downloaded it for my coming trip to Honolulu in Hawai‚Äôi. Not in the app yet, even though it‚Äôs one of the top vacation spots in the world. I tried M√©xico city, the largest megalopolis in the western hemisphere and it is not there either. It‚Äôs several months or years from being useful. Three stars because the concept is great but it lacks content. | I‚Äôm so excited about this app where I can planning my next journal. | Great starting point if you want to get a quick tour plan suggestion | Works cool, limited to mostly euro destinations. Stick to Reddit | Love it ! | Good for start planning places you never visit | Pretty sure that‚Äôs illegal | kinda boring just feels like it was built by a bunch of engineers. don‚Äôt feel like any of the suggestions are cool | If I wanted to go to the same destinations everyone is is traveling to, why do I need ai? Albania is not offered. | Cannot find any city. | Doesn‚Äôt work for any cities! Gives a 502 error. Can‚Äôt even send feedback. | I have mixed feelings about iPlan.ai. On the one hand, I appreciate the app's concept of helping travelers create itineraries for their trips. However, I was disappointed to find that the app only works for a limited number of cities. If you're planning a trip to a major tourist destination, then you're likely to find something useful in iPlan.ai. But if you're traveling to a less popular location, then you might be out of luck.
Additionally, the app could benefit from more features, such as the ability to create itineraries for multiple cities. It would also be great if the app could use your current location to suggest nearby attractions and activities. Overall, I think iPlan.ai has potential, but it needs to expand its city selection and add more features to truly be a useful tool for travelers. For these reasons, I can only give the app two stars. | Stuck on 100% loading screen. Killed the app and the generated results were there. 

When I scroll down on my planned day, it sends me to the previous days plan. Did this for not all but multiple days . Keeps sending me to the previous day so I can‚Äôt see what is planned towards the end of some days. 

Buggy and rushed - last pushed update 10 months ago | There is a lack of good places in the app in each city i know | Helpful | Can‚Äôt close any attraction image opened in iPhone 11 Max pro. | Nice and easy app to use | If you‚Äôre looking to plan a vacation and need some inspiration this app is for you. | I really love the application because it is so easy to use. I got my travel plan for Istanbul and it was great. Thanks iplan.ai | I like the idea, I think if there is an option to choose restaurants and meal break location by our taste and wishes it could be better. For example i can check what kind of foods and restaurants i like to try and the app could offer them between programs. Or if there is a restaurant with high ranking in nearby of our visiting locations it could be suggested by app. And also if there is an option to choose type of shopping mall and location of we prefer modern locations or traditional shopping spot, or type of stuffs we are looking to buy, for example if i give a high score to shopping app ask me what i want to shop, suits or sport clothes and by my prefer it could give better options. | loved the idea and will use in the next tripüëå | The concept is exciting can‚Äôt wait to test it on my next trip.",4.46784,964,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/20/9f/46/209f4665-c2ee-a0a1-061c-b33bff1aa8e6/c6f2d824-f263-45f3-9a94-03f782525fe9_00-video.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/dc/be/8c/dcbe8cf1-0c4e-911b-239f-e64218955b07/143a62c4-a7ef-48be-9459-d4371aece6bc_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/96/6a/a9/966aa912-942f-5839-7abd-fadc53ff252f/508766bb-34f6-4844-886f-7c9e82aa02c1_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f2/c0/17/f2c01795-d0bc-c102-4a2b-3c0a9f23e782/c405c0df-d0c7-4685-aa0e-3be2bf2a3bc3_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f7/93/49/f79349a4-2f12-35aa-6ac5-91ddc2d6565f/671e84fc-fd14-461a-b12b-90891490dcfc_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6e/37/86/6e3786d1-f17c-0175-d8a7-183d213d08f5/4c23e7ad-bad2-47c2-b04d-5dec3552312d_05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/04/37/77/043777ae-1307-9c49-793a-7ec8c24463d7/4cfb5529-9c91-4628-9ea8-e76cb2467251_06.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

The scanning will take ages if you have lots of pictures in your camera roll. I actually could never get it to entirely load even on fast WiFi and letting it sit for 30+ min.

Not only does this app do that, it does it so well!

It's easy to use and I like it so much I upgraded. | Even though the Location data is correct on the photos, it does not see it in the list to pick a photo . Also when I choose a photo from my library, it will not save on the map.   Great concept though. | I love the idea of this app but I wish there were more countries such as smaller caribbean countries etc. | I wasn‚Äôt sure if you‚Äôd see it, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw your response. Thank you very much! :) | I love to travel and be able to keep up with where I have been and where I haven‚Äôt!

However when in a country or state it won‚Äôt scroll up to list the rest of the places or if I‚Äôm trying to select a picture it won‚Äôt let me scroll up either. I deleted the app and the downloaded again but it didn‚Äôt help | For some reason it will show up on the map like when I put the photo in and click the checkmark it doesn‚Äôt show up on the map itself so it‚Äôs good but just doesn‚Äôt work. | Easy to use;  well designed. | It basically only scans your ‚ÄúRecents‚Äù folder. I have 70,000 photos synced from my computer and this didn‚Äôt include any of them. So it shows I‚Äôve only been to 2 states when in fact I‚Äôve been to 30+ and several countries. | I love this app but I am a bit confused because an entire piece of Africa is missing half of Somalia is just not on the map the area called Somaliland | I can‚Äôt even upload a freaking picture app is stupid | It would be cool if the user could rename the maps titles and add multiple maps for group travel vs personal tracking | Wouldn‚Äôt place any of my 460 pictures?? | We really like this app for sharing where we‚Äôve been because it includes photos and makes cool maps!! | This is an excellent app, which provides a great way to visualize your travels.  It's fun to see how many counties within a state we've been to.  The app does a good job of letting you quickly and easily pick a representative photo for each country/state/county region you've been to.  

Highly recommended! | I like it but could let you make the pictures better for it | The app is great except there‚Äôs no way to back up or sync maps. I‚Äôd love an iCloud sync option so I don‚Äôt need to simply save the partial maps I have with meticulously cropped/rotated photos into each border shape! | Fun idea and works relatively well. However, it does not sort all photos correctly. If the location is relatively close to a different state (even a few miles within the state), it often sorts them into wrong ones. Manual selection does not work in those cases either! You can select a photo, but it doesn‚Äôt show up in the map on my iPad Pro 12.9 M1 ( It works on my M1 MacBook Air though) | It keeps glitching and going to the beginning. | Best app ever | Beautifully designed and built app. No useless features, just a really easy, fun way to track travel. | This app was exactly what I was looking for. Perfectly perfect!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! | I downloaded this on the way home from a road trip- wow!  What a fantastic app.  I had a lot of fun tracking our trips and adding pictures.  Will continue to use this app for years to come! | I love this app! It is very easy to change the photo selected by the program or to adjust the picture that was selected. I second the idea of using photo dates to re-create a trip itinerary. We do many road trips and it would be awesome to see each journey outlined are highlighted in someway. Thank you. You have done an excellent job with this app and I‚Äôm excited to see your future improvements. | I upload 9pics for 9differents states because thats all i have. but i dodnt know how to check out or proceed the process looks like no option. Please can somebody help me. Thanks! 
im new to this.. | I downloaded it and bought the pack on my iPad, but I can‚Äôt upload or save any photos to the maps. Waste of money if you want to uae it on the iPad. | Favorite app of all time!! I bought the explorer pack I absolutely love. However, why is there no sections split up for Switzerland? I‚Äôve been to many different parts and it would be cool to see. Nothing big though for issues love the app!!! | This is a really cool app! The United States map is incredible‚Ä¶ I love being able to track all the states that I have been to over the years. I'd love to see features such as cropping the photo and moving it to fit the state. Without this feature it makes it hard to pick a photo. I hope to see a upgrade to printing or ordering the photo for those with a photo map. 
(Not sure if this is an upgrade with in the app) 
I'm not sure if this is the same thing, but the online version is a little bit better as i can crop and move and order with company! I also discovered this neat idea through tiktok. | Nice but We should be able to resize photo in state and also have multiple pics in a state | I have a feature request: since the photos contain dates, you could recreate an approximate itinerary for every trip. To know what is considered a trip, the user would have to set its home country. Then a trip is effectively the places visited while outside of the home country. Moreover, min and max dates while outside the home country would be the trip duration. Given a new view for Trips then the user could quickly find fotos of every trip. It could be ordered chronologically. 

Keep up the great work! | I. Cant add anymore photos | It‚Äôs an awesome app, I love it. I just wish I could create multiple maps for all of my travels with different people. Other than that I really enjoy the appüôÇ | Keeping the iOS eco-system clean, neat and tidy. Came across this creatively simple app after months! Nicely made.

Edit:
Updated to 3 stars from 5 after the in-app purchase that unlocks other countries. Other countries only show states while missing the cities left alone counties. | When you try to select a photo after granting access to your photo library, the scrolling does not work properly. When you scroll towards the bottom to see more pictures instead it just resets back to the top. This is happening on an iPhone 12 Pro.

Update: Still broken on iPhone 13 Pro | One of my favorite apps. Explorer‚Äôs Pack is worth every penny. | Definitely worth the download! Can‚Äôt wait to add more places I‚Äôve been.

Please fix this. | fix your app please | I love this app so much but two problems
problem 1. there is a bug when you try to store a photo on Figi,when you select it it goes back to ‚ÄúWorld Countries‚Äù.
problem 2. I want you to make a National photo for maps of countries or continents. | Bc | Love the concept of the app but I can‚Äôt upload multiple photos.

limited sync functionality with old emails and poor non ios compatibility like with my computer | Peace of mind being able to track loved ones‚Äô flights. Super helpful and easy to use. | They are so clearly paying MacRumors, Macstories, 9to5, Mac Power Users, Upgrade, and more soooo much money to lie for them. The app doesn‚Äôt work nearly as well as these terrible podcasters claim it does. Widgets are never updating properly, Apple Watch complications are not updating properly, and I have now taken four flights with the app, while being subscribed, and not once has the live activity shown up three hours or even two hours before the fight. I don‚Äôt know how I got it to show at all the first couple of flights, but right now I‚Äôm not able to get it to show anything and I‚Äôm about to fly in 2 1/2 hours. No live activity there. My phone is at 80%, not in low power mode and I just don‚Äôt know how much money they want me to pay until the Apple properly work.

Still doesn‚Äôt work well in Asia. Stop stealing our money! | While the app is beautiful and generally works really well, it triggers SO many notifications due to the limited options for types of notifications in the app. It would be much better if you could have radio button options for each individual notification option instead of them being grouped. 

As others have said, there is overall great value to this app and I won‚Äôt be going anywhere. But I cannot offer more than 3 stars due to the notification issue I previously stated. I‚Äôve been emailing the developer for years pleading for change. | Occasional traveler here. This app saved our bacon by notifying me that our plane had been changed for an upcoming flight which could impact our seat locations. Sure enough, one of our three seats had been moved about ten rows away. Thanks to this timely alert we were able to avoid a last minute stressful ""what-the-what?"" at the airport. I am a first time user of this app and totally sold on its usefulness. | THe app is good. But sometimes, pro features such as flight forecast doesn't appear and says insufficent data. I will update to 5 start once that is fixed. | Flighty is a fun way to track you flights the colorful interface makes it an amazing app for anybody flying the use of live activities and the Apple Watch are amazing though the price could be cheaper but still it is a great app keep up the good work | Love | Great app | I signed up for a premium family membership after seeing rave reviews. I‚Äôve reported numerous data issues over the past month and none have been resolved. Every flight I‚Äôve taken with LATAM is incorrect in some way, having never updated upon landing (only estimates show in the app). One even has the wrong aircraft information ‚Äî I‚Äôve reported this three times to no avail. Also, older flights from the 00s that I took on Continental are incorrectly showing as Copa Airlines.

These issues need to be resolved, particularly regarding LATAM flights I took this month (Google/flightaware have correct info) or I will not be renewing my membership. | This app has all the information, and even when there‚Äôs problems they warn you instead of blocking you behind flighty pro. Gets info to me faster than the airline. | Love this app! So helpful to track your flights, and especially love the Flighty passport. Suggestion for future updates- would love if there was an option to share your Flighty passport with all the previous flights with your Flighty friends. | This really is a well thought out app. And, they continue to improve with slight tweaks on usability ‚Äì which just impresses me.
I have a family subscription which shares it around, and I‚Äôm happy to pay the monthly fee. The app is just really really that good. | Love the app and all the statistics you can get over the years. Wish I had Pro features but $50/yr or $250 for life is kind of a lot | If you fly a lot, a must have | Best apps for flights tracking | 10/5 stars!!! I love this app and it is worth it! It always notifies me of delays, plane changes, gate changes well before the attendants or gate agents tell me something. It‚Äôs nice to feel like you have the same if not better information than them when you‚Äôre sitting on the plane waiting for ‚Äúmaintenance updates‚Äù which sometimes can take hours. | You should warn users in China that the app doesn‚Äôt work before accepting money from us.

All the podcasters like Macrumors, Macstories, MacPowerUsers, Upgrade, and more are lying buttholes that deserve to have their shows deleted. | Flighty is very helpful - when it works. Unfortunately I frequently have to delete it and start all over again to get full functionality. | I‚Äôm incredibly ocd about my flighty I love seeing the airports I‚Äôve been to, how far I‚Äôve traveled, planes I‚Äôve taken etc. however the private aviation tracking on the app is terrible flight aware blows flighty out of the water in this regard. Just add an option to put in tail number it‚Äôs that simple. | Being an airline pilot I need timely information as to my flights, and I have used many apps; FLIGHTY is hands down the best app I have ever used in tracking my flights. Paying the yearly fee is a no brainer if you are an avid flyer.  So without hesitation I would highly recommend FLIGHTY!!! | –†–∞—Å—á–µ—Ç –¥–ª–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ª–µ—Ç–æ–≤ –æ—Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –±–µ–∑ —É—á–µ—Ç–∞ —á–∞—Å–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ø–æ—è—Å–æ–≤. | Trains!? | I fly all of the time and use multiple airlines whose apps all have one issue or the other. Flighty covers those gaps, gives all of the details I could possibly want, and give me some fun historical data too. It lets me know updates at least 10 minutes ahead of most apps and sometimes hours before (looking at you delta for baggage claim details). If you fly a lot you need this, if not the airline apps may be enough for you. | This application is an essential application for anyone who travels. The application provides information sooner than airports, in more detail, and gives you a way to look at historic information about your own travels. Not only this, but they offer the option for purchase the application as a one-time purchase. I‚Äôd encourage you to use a subscription so that development continues, but having the option is great to encourage any type of user to use the application. Finally, it‚Äôs share features are really valuable. My parents will sometimes be traveling and I can share information with them about their flights, helping them navigate the challenges of flying without a ton of hassle. 

I recommend this app to any traveler, whether you‚Äôre a road warrior or just going on a yearly family vacation. | This is a great app, however is too costly.it would be nice to plug in flight that friend and family do as free reaaearch | Good app. Great UX. Decent accuracy. | I love tracking my flights. Where I‚Äôve been throughout the year, how many miles and hours flown . Is super cool | This is a decent app and useful. I‚Äôd even pay a few bucks to buy the app, maybe even $10. But $4/week is nuts. And $250 for the flat one time price honestly seems like a joke. That‚Äôs like what a license for Microsoft office was before Office 365. 

I‚Äôm tired of the subscription model for everything. | I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP!!! I use Flighty every week as I travel for work and vacation A LOT and I can‚Äôt express how much flighty has helped me with timings! Before downloading flighty about 2 years ago I was missing flights but never since I downloaded it. The updated timing on flights is faster than flash! Wether there is a delay or the flight departure is earlier, flighty got you along with the exact gate and terminal the flight is in and no problem if it changes because flighty updates it in a few seconds and guess what they also tell you when you should start walking to the gate which is incredible !!! One of my favorite features on Flighty is being able to see how old the aircraft is, THAT IS VERY VERY HELPFUL, I try to avoid any plane over around 22 years old since they have poor entertainment systems and not as comfortable seats. The UI on this app is simply amazing, I want to congratulate the developers because they did a very amazing job creating this masterpiece of an app. 

A small but very helpful feature for the future:

One feature I would like to see on the app as a very frequent user is being able to see a turbulence satellite such as the Turbulence forecast app, that way if the turbulence is bad I will be able to avoid it and purchase a flight with less turbulence. 

Thank you very much for helping me to never miss a flight again FLIGHTY TEAM!! Keep doing what you guys are doing :)) | Flighty is the best app for staying updated with flight infomation.  As a crew member, I have multiple flights a day and the information and updates are always quick and correct.  Everyone that travels should be using Flighty. | This app has a lot of features that are supposed to be real time. Unfortunately this is not the case when you travel in Asia. Flights show  ""on time"" when  they are delayed.   No information on incoming aircraft is available.  For a frequent traveler the extra money spend for Premium subscription it is a waste of money.  I wish I could get my money back. | I‚Äôm a crew member and was told about this app. I used basics then sprung for whole package. I get alerts on delayed departures and gate changes from Flighty before my company app . Pretty amazing . | This app is unlike any other. If you travel remotely often, this is a MUST download. The free version is very useful but the premium is peak. | Love the way the app looks and works, even on just the free tier. However for sharing flight info it‚Äôd be nice to be able to have some privacy settings so you can generate a link that just has the basic flight info without anything like your name or profile picture on it. | It's a very useful and not too complex application. The fact that you pay for it and they don't fix stubborn bugs for years is just incredibly annoying. Why is the ""where's my plane"" section clipped most of the time to the point that you have to use a competing app to get the same info? The list of little things goes on and on. How hard is it that it's ignored for years? | I was sitting on the plane waiting to depart and the second we started moving I got a notification from the app. This is much faster than the other travel apps I use. | It won‚Äôt let me expand it like the others - any reason why? Also doesn‚Äôt tell me where my plane will fly next. | Great app for every aviation lover that loves to keep up with their travels | My son is a flight attendant and he gives me all of his flight numbers so that I can track him to wherever he is going. This is one of the best applications I have ever used and I highly, highly recommend anyone who wants to check where someone is flying to use this app. | Super helpful | I‚Äôm a very frequent traveler and this app has changed my life. Automatically finding my flights from my calendar and pushing very valuable information. My flight wasn‚Äôt delayed yet, but the inbound was, and I really appreciate knowing about it. I also love the live activity showing my gate and countdown till departure. | Love being able to track my flight and the fact I can see past flights on this app. I‚Äôm glad I found it some years ago. Keep up the great work developers. | It wasn‚Äôt able to track flights by Ethiopian airlines its just says reported to be still at gate , whereas on flight24 and flight tracker its tracks it good, but on flightly i tested it with multiple flights by ET no difference, when the other platforms cant make accurate tracking they at least notify by estimated arrival time | When the app works it‚Äôs great. Sadly on my travels to Dubai Bangkok Taipei and Sapporo only Taipei displayed useful info. The rest all reported no or incorrect information. Disappointed as I paid for this and it doesn‚Äôt really work 90% of the time. I wonder if the rave reviews are all US based which is fine but market yourself as a US only app. Thanks. | Love love love this App !! I love and breath Flightly ! It is so useful and use it daily . 
ONLY thing I wish they had is to be able to add my flight info straight on my Apple Watch instead of my iPhone ! Please developer if you can make that happen ,, I‚Äôll make a new review on my YouTube channel regarding this amazing app ! Otherwise GREAT APP ! Very satisfied and sooo useful thank you ! @Flywithshelly | I flew with Thai AirAsia and apart from Flight no an date/time, which is available elsewhere, there is no information. No gate number. No delay notice. Nothing that I paid for pro features has been delivered. So it is totally useless for me. Maybe it is only for USA? | The app looks super legit but after hours of using it I still can't figure out how to navigate it. Everything's laid out in an obscure way and the flights that I put in from last week are not in my ""passport history"" for some reason. Is there even an account associated with the app? It's like everything I spent a lot of time manually adding isn't there anymore. The idea is awesome and I like the features but you should be able to see friends previous flights by viewing their profile, instead of just the ones coming up.

Received the 6 digit email verification that I entered on the site. Great! Time to book‚Ä¶ a pop up appears asking to verify my telephone number. What? No probs, the telephone that is displayed is right‚Ä¶.. waited for my text message. Never received it. 

I now can‚Äôt enter my account without the second OTP code.

I‚Äôll try my PC but this leaves a bad taste in my mouth. | I tried to sing up for an account and the app keeps deleting the last digit of my number.. pathetic app | After multiple attempts over three days, a supremely negative review is warranted. After logging in to attempt a seat assignment thru this app, the best I get is a blank white screen. 
Trying VietJet‚Äôs app for ‚Äúother airline‚Äù compounds the frustration since no reference number supplied by either airline will retrieve my online booking . 
Instead of AirAsiaMove, I‚Äôll choose Bangkok Air henceforth. | I am totally disappointed with ur Mobile app. I have filed the complaint many times and it‚Äôs over a month and still it‚Äôs not fixed. I guess the Management is sleeping n dnt care about the customers. I dnt recommend to anyone with so poor service. | The so called ‚Äúmodify booking‚Äù function does not work. It allows you to select the new flight then the ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù button promptly turns grey. I was told by the ‚Äúsupport staff‚Äù that the only way to modify the booking is to actually travel all the way to the airport of departure and talk to sales staff who couldn‚Äôt care less. I was told to talk to the ‚Äúchat box‚Äù. Absolute rubbish. | The worse app I ever downloaded by for! Can‚Äôt check in online because the app can‚Äôt find my reservation even a the reservation code and name was correct! Can register because the number shows up when doing the phone verification, it always missing one digit! I tried multiple times and the issue was still the same! | Wanted to look up a flight. Open the app it says I have to download the app update, so I updated. When to flight search screen, and where I type in where I am flying ‚Äúfrom‚Äù and ‚Äúto‚Äù I cannot type anything because there is no keypad to type anything. It is not possible to fill in the blank üòÜ so I am canceling my membership and deleting the app altogether. | App crashed continuously while I‚Äôm trying to go through passport and ticket check. Very poor performance, slow and buggy. | I created a profile with my USA phone number but the app deleted a digit so I am unable to verify my telephone through text. Please fix. I am trying to buy a flight.  Thank you. | Most features don‚Äôt work, or don‚Äôt load any information. Why even bother with an app if you can make it work. Seems mostly focused on up-selling primarily useless products and promotions. | I tried to book this flight yesterday for $165 and could not get it to go in could not receive SMS so today it cost $188 for the same flight and I spent two hours. I had to re-enter data credit card several times not happy. | Really really useless app. The website instructs to download the app to get live chat support but the app use the same chat bot as the website. The bot couldn‚Äôt understand most commands and request for human, live agent, people, customer support all return the same ‚ÄúI can help you faster‚Äù message. Exactly the level of poor service you expect from a Malay airline | This app is so bad that I must leave a review. They don‚Äôt even have real humans. I wish their chat bot ‚ÄòBo‚Äô didn‚Äôt exist, it is actually the most infuriating thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Hopefully this company goes bankrupt. | So I am leaving in a week from the United States to the Philippines and I got a text today that said I should download the app and login there for my flight information. I downloaded the app and upon signing in and creating the login with my iPhone, it asks for date of birth and country dialing code as well as your mobile number. The mobile number is seven digits plus the area code for a total of 10 but every time I go in and try to register my cell phone to get a code sent to me. It says invalid number, because it leaves the sixth digit out after clicking next. I have tried it 100 different times and downloaded the app all over again after deleting it, and even restarted my phone, but nothing I do helps. This app is unusable for me and I don‚Äôt know who to contact to even get support. | New review:

New update reminded me that I still have this app on my phone 4 years later. Still a terrible app. Not formatted for an iPhone 13 Pro. No dark mode. Don‚Äôt need it and won‚Äôt be using it any time soon. Will be deleting it.

Old review:

Soon after entering my phone number into profile , I started getting group texts from random emails. Email texts contained links to scam sites. Their data bank is hacked. | The OTP system does not send the numbers to my email and I am unable to log into my account. The system is not upgraded but flawed. | Just downloaded the new app‚Ä¶.the site froze as I was updating my telephone number. Check my WiFi, all good. Tried numerous times to input the
number. No chance to make a reservation. üò° | Moving away from company branding is not smart move. I almost deleted this app as I did not recognise when I ever downloaded the app. Not to mention that functionality is just bloated. I never expect to use this app other than booking a flight. For hotel and other services I would have looked elsewhere. All I need is just flight detail and checkin. Please deliver only that. Do not force feed your customers. | So frustrating!
Force you to sign up but the app does not accept any phone number | Worst airline customer service on earth. In the history of earth. I‚Äôve been locked out of my account for 3 months and all they can tell me is why. I know why but only they can fix it. And it goes on and on and on. | It would not take my password or accept a new one either. I spent 2 hours screwing with it on my phone and on the computer. Their tech has gotten much worse!!! | Any time I try to create an account or login with my existing one, I‚Äôm required to verify my phone number - an expensive requirement when traveling outside one‚Äôs home country - but the verification prompt for some reason deletes the third digit of my phone number every time (at least displays as such) and, perhaps consequently, I‚Äôve never successfully received the OTP text | Worst App Ive had to deal with! | Apparently airasia is able to aver charge you in any flight once you change from booking details to payment method with the app/page (my case was 4 min to fill out both).
They haven‚Äôt disclosed any details about the extra amount deducted from my account after booking my flight, on the ticket (receipt) received by airasia indicates a different amount than the one charged to my card.
The costumer service assured that they are able to do that due the time difference in between booking details and payment method. They have also mentioned that I can check on the breakdown of the price to know extra fees, which I have but I doesn‚Äôt mention anywhere the excess charged to me, and I either received a email to clarify this. | I don‚Äôt like this airline becauseee:
- they charge for every bag they can
- they force you to check in at baggage drop counter instead of online 
- not that polite 
- slow line | Keeps messing up my phone # and won‚Äôt let me change to verify. Won‚Äôt let me change my flight and doesn‚Äôt save my flight. Too many pop ups. Not gonna use this airline again | good ride | When I buy tickets by app , I can‚Äôt  transfer k plus bank | It‚Äôs a great idea to create competition but 9.5/10 times I try to book a car (Penang) they cannot find a driver. Believe it or not sometimes I even stupidly wait to find a car even after 30-40 minutes. | I tried to leave feedback on the app. But the submit button doesn‚Äôt work! Which is infuriating because I have a big complaint. Also, when I tried to contact customer support I get sent to ‚ÄúBo‚Äù a really bad AI program. | I have tried to complete my profile to use the app but cannot get past the first hurdle due to a glitch in the app. When I fill in my phone number, it has a 1 in the 3rd to last number of a 10 number string. When try to verify the number using an OTP, the OTP request screen which captures your number from your profile doesn‚Äôt register the 1. I have tried inserting other numbers in the space and it works. Only 1 doesn‚Äôt but it means I cannot verify my number and this cannot get into the app at all. Incredibly frustrating. | The service was good and good price. In Malaysia we used the ride and the service was really good and good price. | Cannot verify a USA phone number in the App.  the app drops a digit out of the phone number, so the OTP cannot be sent.  This is a BUG.  The Website is able to send the OTP | - I have booked SNAP but when I went to hotel, they said no booking.
- Customer service difficult to contact and reply to late. Waste time to wait them.
- CS just said ‚ÄòSorry‚Äô this cost only flight.
SNAP showed me so clearly, I will have flight+hotel. 
And finally they have no responsibility.

- Every time opened the application have to update but Nothing improve in the application.

Should be improve your service first, no need for application. üò°üíÄ | The form truncates your phone number so you never receive the OTP | Booked flight online and never received ticket. No, Customer Service responded!! I tried for 24 hours to contact customer service multiple ways. Never receive response never was told if I need to re-purchase ticket or if the ticket was available at airport. Very frustrating!
Does not provide the information needed
No way to contact Customer Service!
Bookings do not show up under ‚Äúmy bookings‚Äù‚Ä¶ Customer Service does not know how to fix for me. | This does not let me sign in and put my phone number | When i use app, it comes up with a mandatory screen to update my profile.  The phone number is valid.  When i click to verify phone number it drops the last digit and then says its an invalid number.  I cant get out of this loop to actually use app to check flight status. Not good. | I‚Äôve had to enter my details into the app several times. I also wanna warn you that if you‚Äôre catching your flight at DMK, the line is so long to check in and drop your bag and then you‚Äôve got about 1 km to get through security to gate 12. It takes 30 minutes and all the way you‚Äôre trave there though threatening to close the door on you | I filled out my profile too quickly, and didn‚Äôt switch the gender from male to female. Now I can‚Äôt edit it. Even if I open my profile on their website and change it to female, the save button is greyed out and I can‚Äôt save my changes. Their chat bot Bo won‚Äôt help me with it, and there‚Äôs no way to contact anyone for help. | THANK YOU FOR A GREAT EXPERIENCE | Efficient and Convenient | App logged me out and now won‚Äôt allow me to add personal info to log back in. Terrible UE. | We booked flights using the air Asia application from Krabi to BKK. 5/6 reservations with our group went through and 1 was left stranded. The application constantly locks up and says ‚Äúoops something went wrong ‚Äú. I would use a more reliable airline with better technology if you have travel plans that are important to you. | Easy , great deal, fast access | I logged in and the app prompted me to fill in my profile. I entered the information that I could, however the app required a phone number, but the field would not allow me to enter a phone number.

They are very friendly and their home is so welcoming. 
Comfortable room and all the amenities anyone would want. Super clean. 
I would stay again anytime! | Enjoy the booking process, follow-up and convenience! | I loved my first MisterB&B trip, and I‚Äôm excited to use this app again for future travel. It‚Äôs great for finding places to stay with kind and like-minded folks. | This was my 2nd time at Tony‚Äôs place and I would love to return in the future. Tony is a great guy and a wonderful host: laid back, responsive, relaxed‚Ä¶and a extraordinary photographer. The house is filled with his photography and other very cool art. Love the design of the house. The pool and hot tubs are a big plus. | Es muy f√°cil , buena calidad y adem√°s muchas opciones. 
Adoro esta aplicaci√≥n | Saludos | Tony, the host, was courteous and helpful. His welcome was warm and engaging. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. The shared spaces were plentiful and well appointed and stocked. Throughout our stay Tony was always available and checked in on us to make sure we were ok and if we needed anything. The other guests were delightful and social. Great location to multiple activities and functions. We highly recommend for your stay in the Phoenix area. | It would be nice to find or have them implement‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I would like an audio cue from the app when I receive a request for a booking or when I receive a message from a guest. | PLEASE! I dont want notifications. It is VERY annoying that you harrass people trying to use your app asking to turn on notifications. I DONT WANT IT! If I click ‚Äúmaybe later‚Äù dont ask me AGAIN 10 seconds later! Come on! | Hotel Zoso in Palm Springs was a great find. Centrally located, with an incredibly kind staff, I‚Äôd stay here again! 
My only feedback would be to have more services (food/drink) available during the week day. I‚Äôm not sure I saw one server around the pool, and the restaurant was never open during my stay. | Biggest and best! | first time using this app. super handy. easy to navigate. was able to narrow down exactly what kind of space i needed. | . So far the best üíûüíû | Really good to find a place. Prices are good. | I attempted to book a weekend trip through this app. After I had successfully completed the booking I noticed I was being charged monthly for an ‚Äúin-app app‚Äù social network. When I called to cancel the new monthly subscription they had stuck into my reservation‚Ä¶ the lady helping me cancelled my entire reservation! She didn‚Äôt tell me either‚Ä¶ So I landed in Miami with no place to stay. Based on this experience I wouldn‚Äôt ever use this app again. Which is a shame because I like supporting my community. But I don‚Äôt appreciate blatant hidden charges or huge administrative mistakes. | Humans travelen are happier than  persons with their boring routene go en on . So I Aim for the future to do Mr b& b care stays for humans on mi local area at mi home . | Enjoying the social and connection benefits of this app. | Contacted support, they said they don‚Äôt know why, can‚Äôt activate it and need to resolve the issue with their legal team. A MONTH! It‚Äôs just unacceptable. French customer service is always the worst | They have great places, at much more reasonable prices and the booking process is so much simpler than with other sites.   I love it! | They charge you before you get a place to stay, and if the host doesn‚Äôt accept your request, that charge will be there, so you‚Äôll have to request another place to stay and they‚Äôll charge again!  Also once you put your credit card information, they don‚Äôt give you the option to remove that credit card, and they‚Äôll make some random charges, also they have a monthly subscription called WEERE PRO that they will sign you up even if you don‚Äôt request it or sign up for, try other app where you can rent a place to stay at a better price with no hidden fees and subscriptions. | Great resource for the queer wayfarer | App gets slow and sometimes a saved password doesn‚Äôt work either on app or website. I have tried to book for months and mostly declined the request or don‚Äôt even respond. Sometimes feels like this is a dating app where picky people are. I don‚Äôt face these issues on other booking apps and even got good reviews. Traveled around the world for years now and as a gay man I don‚Äôt feel like this is any better than a bad dating app experience. 

Additionally the Weere feature is stressful as well. | Wow | I tried using the app to find LGBTQ friendly places to stay. However, in more than three tripes, I have requested multiple listings and all of them either not reply or simply decline for no reason. And finally I got accepted on my request, the host immediately said they cannot accommodate me if my train is going to arrive late to check in. Late as in 9pm. And misterb&b refuse to issue me a full refund and asks me to try to find another reservation instead. After all of this experience, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using this app at all since it‚Äôs not reliable and you cannot get a refund. It‚Äôs not worth it and who knows how these hosts pick and choose who they accept. I don‚Äôt need that kind of discrimination when I travel. | Look forward for to using the service | Such attention to detail and accuracy in their listings! | But you don‚Äôt even prompt my phone to autofill with my card info. The easier it is for your customers to spend money, the more likely they are to do it | It‚Äôs nice to have a unique service like this that supports the specific clientele | markus was a great host! great location | Recently had a trip to London, UK. Found. Great host | I usually try and book with MBNB to support the community, but over half the time I get frustrated and go to AirBnB. The hosts don‚Äôt reply, or they have an unexpected event that they are unavailable but forgot to remove the dates. It is sad. | No review | We booked a room through them. We had a pet emergency the night before we were to go I explained that I did not want to cancel but reschedule. They did not care and made no attempt to work with us. They took our money. The hosts were no different. I would not recommend Mr B&B and I would be very careful who you book with as you could lose your money as we did. | Disappointed to not get my full deposit back even tho I cancelled the reservation a month+ before the check in date. | Have used it many times and it has worked out well. | Love it | This was the worst experience that I had as a guest. I stayed at a place hosted by Alban in Paris. The place was really dirty, smelled like pee, no bed sheets and with flies, yes flies. Alban the host admitted the that he didn‚Äôt clean up the place at all before I arrived. He admitted all this in a written message within the Mister B&B messaging platform and Mister B&B didn‚Äôt do anything about that because it was more than 48 hours after I stayed there. I tried to submit the inquiry before the 48 hours but they don‚Äôt have an easy way to contact customer support form their app. I had to find an email from the finance department to submit it from some place very hidden in their website. I just found an email from the finance department and I sent the message to them. Anyhow, I end up leaving Alban‚Äôs place because it was very dirty and I got an Airbnb. Alban said that he was going to reimburse but didn‚Äôt reimburse anything at the end and Mister B&B basically said that it‚Äôs not their problem given that they sent the payment to Alban already. Watch out with the places that you find here, and if you need to file a claim, good luck with finding an email to contact their customer support team. Actually I don‚Äôt think they might have a customer support team in place and Alban if you are seeing this, you are a BIG SCAMMER and so are you Mister B&B, life will take care of this. | Place was amazing.  Clean and well appointed.  It was a pleasure working with Adam.  Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. | Avoid! Horrible ordeal. Made a reservation, listing host cancelled but still charged my credit card $2,365. And again $15 for God knows what. Had to cancel my credit card. It took me 3 months, 14 phone calls and more than 7 hours lost time to get my money back! No real apology or gift certificate to rectify the terrible and unfair situation. Just wow | Very easy to navigate | This apartment was perfectly located and just the right place to explore and then come home to regroup! | Five Stars! | The only time I get guest when the price is extremely lowered and discounted on top of that when offered 24/hr access to amenities, spa service options, pick and up and drop off if need to be and giving all the hottest tips when going out. | Nope. Not going to happen. Delete. | Discouraging. As a queer woman, I was excited to see something like this. The description says ‚Äúlgbt‚Äù but it‚Äôs literally got ‚Äúmister‚Äù in the title. You left out the L and the B. ü•≤ | Do not use. This is not a safe place for gay men but a place for predators. Shame on misterbnb. | Had an incredible weekend!  Courtney is a great host!  Staff was pleasant and welcoming‚Ä¶Hi David!  Breakfast was excellent and a wonderful variety day to day!  The lemon-blueberry pancakes were top notch! Would stay every year!",4.74408,2282,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/31/71/b4/3171b4a9-2f9a-fcac-04a1-237cfb3e191f/5671f782-1231-4060-bde4-aa118821ce79_1-store-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/88/be/32/88be329b-7069-7acf-1798-b24f1dafd3fd/ea043a5e-873c-4593-b9d1-6ba915b3ad42_2-store-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3f/f5/5e/3ff55e2b-aa5f-7ab7-8ee2-4f4acac0a59b/a4afd2e7-428b-4c13-b568-90a9fca2739d_3-store-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/23/b1/be/23b1be7d-345f-81f1-e134-6d9a5d6e6e8a/694618c0-400d-4af9-a010-859c293704f4_4-store-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ff/d7/59/ffd75974-0bd1-88e9-36ce-cb67515c617d/deb23927-8dff-4f11-ace7-784fcd1b1cd0_5-store-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/14/42/e1/1442e195-1510-775b-75fb-0451323ae194/51ef65a3-4e72-442e-9616-fd8849259bed_6-store-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0d/9f/c4/0d9fc41c-88aa-d9ab-8de5-1f77bea45035/e29e353b-f29c-43cb-b2c9-b12e3db4ccb2_1_IPAD_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ff/6a/50/ff6a501d-faa6-7836-ecfd-3964325534ec/d016b53f-3beb-4e3d-980f-15c0b21baec7_2_IPAD_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/3a/a9/73/3aa97327-d736-15d6-0128-4eef7d41331e/7f1fc743-6122-4b8b-a576-3280b7e4695b_3_IPAD_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6b/b6/f5/6bb6f5da-d129-e28d-3f53-57a57da049c3/51f5f0bf-848b-463a-b8c8-2f017a859073_4_IPAD_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/3a/7b/22/3a7b228b-0a35-7113-3bbc-11cda18281e1/048f805d-26cf-4d57-8df0-16edf3418930_5_IPAD_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1b/3f/ed/1b3fed3d-4da9-9e88-f0ec-9de3492d0a63/4302be62-726c-4973-86d0-dd636318b715_6_IPAD_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"
