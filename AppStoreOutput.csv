1-Shipments received in multiple packages.
2-all shipments we’re delayed to be shipped and received after the promised time.
3-i had to return an item due to its awful quality, they charged me around 10 USD 
For a 12 USD item return. | موقع فيه فرص ممتازة 
غموض في كيفية تحديد الصنف لونا ومقاسا | Goood | جدا ممتاز استخدمو كود NV لخصم 70‎%‎ من منتجاتكم | انصحكم فية تطبيق تركي جوده واسعار جبارة | After last update i recive “ beklenmeyen bir hata olustu” error frequently and cant do anything ☹️
Its the first time that this happen after an update, please fix it. | Quality is the best
Prices are logic
Short time shipping
Free shipping is amazing
That would be great if you possibly can collect multiple orders in one time shipping. 
The application system is very good. 
Thank you Trendyol, I think I, finally, found a reliable store to lean on it. | Very easy to use love it😍 | استخدموا كود خصمي enaas
تراني فعلا أشتري لنفسي ومنت أشتري منه دايما قبل ما يفتح في السعودية 🤍 | الصباحية ق١ش٥منزل٦٣١ | ممتاز | Waiting for support helps me with the problem regarding the return of funds. The only thing i got is ignoring during whole month. I tried writing to different mail addresses (i found 3) even couple times. Trendyol assistant in app is absolutely useless, no one calls me back as it was promised. Same thing with calling center. Can’t say nothing bad about products quality and delivery time, but i have no more way to get your attention. | رووووعه احلا برنامج | اتمنى لكم التوفيق جدا ممتاز | Musteri hizmetleri cok bilgisiz ve yardimci olmuyoor | The company, which has been making us struggle for days to return the product we bought, is also trying to harass us by offering different excuses by accepting the return of the product even though the seller sent another product, please do not shop. | شكرا | فرو | وذ | They didn't collect all the items in one package they send it one by one | 😍 | تعامل سيء ومهنية جداً تعبان الحين طلب له ١٤ يوم مايوصل وهم يقولون لا تقلق لا اطلب فلوس المشتريات يقولون لا تقلق الي تسونه مش قلق للعميل لا جداً ما انصح للتسوق منهم اله اذا كان الدفع عند الاستلام وبعد ماانصح غير التسوق الي يكون عندك ابرك من شي ماتعرفة… | حي لبن مدينة الرياض | افضل برنامج تستطيع ان تتسوق منة وانت مرتاح الأسعار فوق الخيال | جيد | Esimin aylik standart olarak kullanip en az 10 bin lira harcadigi bu uygulamayi Galatasaray dusmani programlara sponsor oldugu icin ikimizinde telefonundan silip, sponsorluklarini bitirene kadar bir daha kullanmama karari aldik. Haksizlara canak tutanlara kurus yok. | من خیلی این اپو دوست دارم 
کلا باهاش سرگرمم خیلی🤣 | Fiyatlar pahali avantaji kalmadi | لكن أسعاره اوفر | طلبت طلبات كثيرة و وصلت كلها الا السروال والمقاسات صغيرة بصفة عامه لازم تطلب مقاسات أكبر.
وفي الحقيقة اقرب محل ملابس في الحي جودته أفضل منه. | Poor quality , mistakes in goods purchased . Wrong product, wrong size | تم طلب طقم كامل ووصل منه بلوفر فقط ورفضوا ارسال بقية القطع | هذا التطبيق مره ممتاز والاسعار مره ممتازة انصح بيه للامانة التوصيل مجاني كمان والعروض ماتوقف بدل تدفع 80ريال في تيشرت واحد تدفعو في اربعة او خمسه تيشرتات | احلا متجر | En nefret ettiğim şey özenerek hazırladığım tüm koleksiyonlarım kayb oldu.

اول و اخر تعامل معهم كتطبيق | نصب واحتيال في الأسعار 
في البداية يكون السعر برقم معين ثم يتغير السعر اذا غيرت المنطقة للملكة العربيه السعودية 
سجلت فيديو للشاشه اثبات للاحتيال | لا توجد فيه كل البراندات اردى الانواع فقط والسعر خمسة اضعاف السعر الحقيقي للسلع مقارنة مع التطبيق التركي لذلك يجب مقاطعته | كذب وبهتان التخفيض في العرض غير وفي السلة غير | تطبيق رائع وسهل الاستخدام | Harikasin trend yol | تخفيضات ممتازة | السلام عليكم وحمة الله وبركاته 

توجد ملاحظة عند التسوق من المتجر يظهر السعر منخفض وعند وضع المنتج فالحقيبه يرتفع السعر ويصبح مختلف  ؟! 
مدة التوصيل يفضل تكون في خلال اسبوع واحد ولا يكثر عن ذالك

تحياتي | A note for you, learn English and add it to your website. Not everyone knows Turkish. | But can you pleeeeeease add English, I don’t understand turkish and the reason that keeps me deleting this app every now and then; it’s because of the language. 

Thank you if you’re going to do something about it. | موقع سيئ جدااااا! نسبة الامان فيه ضعيفة فجاءه القى ايميل غير ايميلي مسجل واكلم خدمة العملاء يقولون معليش مانقدر نغيره! انتبهوووو على بطاقاتكم

I’m certain it was from the temu account. I immediately closed my account and unsubscribed from all emails but I was still receiving these emails weeks after closing. | Smooth experience. If no product gets affected along the way, then perfection would be my last word. | Excelente calidad y precio | Les recomiendo Temu , la atención al cliente es magnifica y he adquirido muy buenos productos .,Gracias Temu por tus productos tan a bajo costo . | We enjoyTemu . My daughter is 27 and enjoys all the clothes I pick her out they’re good quality they fit her well and we appreciate the prices and we appreciate all the hard work you do.🙏🏾🙏🏾✌🏽 enjoy all the holiday stickers decorations enjoy a lot of Temu🎉 | I love temu. Never had and issue really. Some people talk trash cuz some items r smaller than expected but really the prices make up for it. Ty temu I appreciate chuzz! | I have been using Temu for a while never had an issue until recently and they gave me credit for what was damaged. I do wish however they were more descriptive with items.  I have ordered a couple of things and when received wasn’t exactly as pictured or described but I have had some very nice items as well.  The customer service made it right! | Cheap, bad luck label, but work fine.
It is how it programs. | I love everything about you… | It’s a really awesome site with good deals just winning free items is really complicated | TEMU IS FAMILY! IF I NEED ANYTHING I BUY FROM TEMU. I WILL ADVERTISE TEMU FOR LIFE | 🥰🥰 | At first, I thought Temu items would be less than good quality, but - for the price, I have been quite happy with all my purchases ! | okay i like temu but they make things so hard to get and i hate it on fish land etc listen if your gonna have people send millions of links and have new people join just give them their points i feel like everyone feels for this me and everyone in my family use this app im down to .05 cents on one and i even made a new account and it said it wouldn’t be allowed to give the points for some stupid reason i would have everything i wanted by now but temu is being a rip off if you wanna make money actually make it possible for the person to get what they want. your products are nice but omg when you make it to where they are down to the last cents and cut them off they don’t wanna play anymore fix your app stop ripping people off. no one needs to spend days literally days trying to work for something your already a big company and have millions or billions just make it to where you actually give people the points quit cutting them off i feel if someone wants to pay for that last cent we should be allowed you would be making money not only but then everyone wouldn’t be cut off from what they want just because temu doesn’t wanna give us that last cent | All my items were beautiful and gifts for different people. | Everything I have ordered is true to size lightweight and cool and comfortable will be great for summer. Will continue to shop 😊 | Hi okay I’ve been using Temu for a bit now, and I will say it’s not bad. I’ve heard the controversy about it and I haven’t experienced it once. Nor has my mother who orders every other day from Temu. It’s honestly like Amazon but cheaper and there’s fun games you can play to try to earn free gifts. | Love it so much | Is good to do business with Temu I have received all the items I ordered is good to do businesses with them 
Thanks Temu | I ordered a package but it’s not at my house it’s supposed to here in a day and I’m trying to track it but all it says is it’s been shipped I would like to have a refund of my 21.59dollars | Love it | Great app | Jose | I’m obsessed….love the products and love the prices even more! | Todo el servicio es bueno y si cumplen al no entregar a tiempo te dan 5 de crédito | Very cute and reasonable pricing | I am so thankful for this app all my items I have received before the delivery date prices is exceptional excellent and packaging is on point thank you so much keep up the great service I am a happy customer and will shop always | I recommend this app.cute stuff,cheap & good quality. | I have ordered from Temu several times now. Most of the time I am very pleased. If I am not, I contact Temu, they advise how to handle each situation and I follow thru. Easy, painless, acceptable! I have read reasons NOT to continue to order BUT as long as products are quality and at least as good as I expect, I will continue. No other company issues…. | I am loving these products. Great value and quick to obtain. | Says I got $300 off after downloading the app but the coupon was no where to be found it’s a total scam of a app 😂 | Everything I borrowed was exactly as viewed and exactly what expected temu is awesome😇 | I love love TEMU , but all of my orders are not arriving on time I’m always collecting $5.00 for each one . Work on shipping please | Great, takes a somewhat longer delay than expected but everything pictured looks good

6446901002,"com.burbn.barcelona","Threads, an Instagram app","https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002?uo=4","Say more with Threads — Instagram’s text-based conversation app.

Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world.

A few things you can do on Threads…

■ Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

■ Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.

■ Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

■ Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

■ Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

■ Open social networking – coming soon
In the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.

Not only does it help you but simply if you need some one to talk to this app does it all . The best there is . | Lectures me at every prompt instead of being useful | I don’t use this app to cheat on school tests, quizzes or assignments but I use this app to give me ideas and to correct my work and it’s a great tool to use. It helped me find a lot of misspelling and grammatical mistakes. Such a great app | 不给中国上线 | The way the system work is amazing it solves and explains complex problems. Thank you! | Would love to see a widget that would allow direct voice to voice conversations with ChatGPT without needing to open the app or leave the Home Screen | The login page is a persistent error page no matter what I do. Can’t sign in so this app is totally useless. | ChatGPT is so nice!!! | I love that you can actually have a conversation with it thanks to the voice control. | 打不開 | When i sign in with Google. It shows the word continue I press it and nothing happens | The App took my name and falsely stated that I was arrested for a crime committed by my son. | I’ve been trying to use chat gpt to help me with my algebra. However I cannot use algebraic symbols and a symbol keyboard is not supported. I would love to see this added in an update from developers | Incredible tool that will only get better. | Thank you AI for helping me understand the world around me in simplified terms. I use this to read legal documents that otherwise confuse me. It has helped verbalize what I want to say in a clear manner. I can also rely on, mostly accurate information. 

It has literally enhanced my life. | ChatGPT has been an incredibly useful tool for me. Whether I need quick answers to questions, assistance with brainstorming, or just want to engage in interesting conversations, ChatGPT delivers every time. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, and I appreciate the diverse range of topics and information available. The responses are consistently helpful and well-articulated. Overall, I highly recommend ChatGPT to anyone looking for a reliable and versatile AI companion. | Sing in failed ? Why | Its so good for homework | app works great, fantastic.. but can't control & protect privacy security settings nor features😤 | Constantly gives inaccurate, redundant and often even outrightly imaginary answers to basic prompts. Never had this issue in earlier versions of this app. It seems to have reduced its capabilities? | ChatGPT is a bit like having your very own J.A.R.V.I.S (Iron Man reference) in the palm of your hand. Ask it almost anything and it will answer with the closest thing to a perfect answer, if not already perfect. I’ve even named mine JARVIS 😆 Exceeds expectations with amazingly detailed, informative, and swift returns. Literally the A.I. we used to see in futuristic movies growing up, but in an app. Definitely recommend giving it a try. It has helped quite a lot in my personal life as well as in my career! | Used to be great, but lately the app doesn’t refresh to show latest history even if I refresh it, kill the app and even reinstall the app. The web version is what i use now. The app is non-functional. | I love this app. Sometimes when I’m stuck or need a brainstorming session, I just type in my thoughts and in return get amazing ideas! This is so helpful when I am a solo entrepreneur and don’t have anyone to brainstorm ideas with. Highly recommend this app!! | I like it | I love this!! | I’m really enjoying using this AI so far. It’s amazing what you can converse about with it. | Almost unusable. Audio is constantly interrupting, has no adjustable time delay, and replies back with very long replies so you have to wait forever to tell chatgpt that it misunderstood yoi. This causes a loss of train of thought as you fight with chatgpt, that doesn’t even realize it has a text to voice feature. 

Generally ChatGPT seems to be getting worse as a product. It’s still a usable tool, but as soon as something equivalent or better comes out I’m dumping my paid service. | What a fantastic breakthrough!  OpenAI really did a good job! | After I subscribed to plus, the company banned my account and did not refund, cheating. | 🎯🙏 | فول وعلي | Im gonna get rich thanks to Chat Gpt!
Thank you Open Ai! | ChatGPT 4 makes ChatGPT 3.5 look like a Palm TX. I'm still new to the app, but I've used it on both my Macbook and my iPhone. The iPhone version does not include some of the features available on the desktop version, such as editing a prompt after it has already been submitted. Otherwise, I think it's very easy to use and extremely handy. It's difficult to think of a reason why I would give it less than five stars. | It cool | It’s a great app | very incredible he liked it a lot 5 stars plus my 10 stars very good the creator of the app for iOS I thank you for helping a lot with the app I am grateful for you there are many interested in helping users gratitude for my presence
best application I have used to date, world the world, with that I thank you so much | Even though it makes mistakes, it more often surprises me with its thorough and thoughtful responses that go above and beyond a search engine. Sometimes it’s fun simply to ask it questions and then a follow up question to see what it shows. Even when it misses the mark, I see something cool.  The future might not be here yet, but it’s good to see we’re heading in that direction. | I love this app it helps me be creative and work by helping me like an personal assistant.
Would recommend!
👍 | The latest update released to the web, ios, and android, completely broke ChatGPT for coders. Coding a responsive Navbar with a navbar slider does not work now. And trying to get most codes to work fails now. Please don't go full Gemini on us. | Every time I ask “make a essay about space” it says “Sorry”

ITS SO ANNOYING! FIX YOUR APP | Chatgpt is really smart and trained.  But when I ask make Dwayne Johnson in ChatGPT  I have ChatGPT 4 | This app is good. It always gives trust worthy answers and would totally recommend!! | It’s soooo goood get it NOW!!! | This is a great personal assistance for anyone to have | I don’t recommend put in my email and password & it was the same one I use for google and all my accounts got hacked almost immediately. They sell your information to 3rd parties and the app is not secure. | Sign in failed
An error occurred during fetching values for the user. 403 | Saved me so much time | The AI seems to be unable to change the way it types. When asked to make a typo or not use exclamation marks, it was unable to, tho it still thinks it could (ironically with a ! at the end of each message). 
When asked to form pictures from text, it struggles greatly. Tho it can somewhat do it, the picture can be unrecognizable at times. 
You cannot be in a low-wifi area or the AI simply wont respond, so I can only sometimes use it during school. 
It is very clear that it is programmed with certain biases, even if it can be made to admit that the biases it has are baseless. Like in one conversation I asked the AI about it being considered alive, and that even biological organisms technically have “coding”. It was very bent on saying that it was absolutely in no way ever possible of being considered living, despite admitting that that it is an ongoing debate and that nothing on the subject is definitive and proven to be true. 
I also think it would be cool if the speaker that can read the text to you, could be manipulated so that it can talk faster or slower. To me, the speaker speaks terribly slowly for the essays the messages tend to become. 
I also notice that sometimes it does get information wrong, but that it can be corrected most of the time by asking it to fix itself, tho it is strange to have to need to ask it to check its answers, I feel there should already be a system where it checks its answers BEFORE sending. Tho this isn’t a big problem, the amount of mistakes it has made is very small, and the mistakes are usually benign. 

Otherwise it has been extremely helpful in pretty much all things, without even needing to get any premium version. | It actuall was able to help me a lot with questions that I needed a awnser to, but the small trick sometime you have to be really specific, which still isn’t a big deal | I can do many duties in less time and solve many complex writing tasks as owner of a business. Also helps me a lot to translate same writings to other languages for clients abroad. Frankly speaking, I saved a lot of money using this app instead to hire freelancers in

It’s really a breath of fresh air! Love you Google! | This app works seamlessly on all my devices. It renders everything faster and better than any other browser! | I’m just getting started,I’m sure I’ll like the app. | And shining bright. North Star of users interface globally. Precision and consistently working with the customer in mind. | Authentication with YouTube is not worth using the app. | Ummm | Kylan and Mishad featuring Will and Lindsay made our first game show SO awesome. It was a great experience. | I hate chrome and Google | Blabalablaabal | From the title you can see that google chrome almost got me hacked.my security app saved me from getting hacked my opinion don’t use chrome as your browser | You can tell from the title | Opening screen on the new chrome has a lite blue cast than I can not remove. By bookmarks do not stay on the list I open, each time I return after selecting Th file I want to view I have to go through the path over and over to select the next address. Bookmarks used to stay in the folder I opened until I selected a different folder . I want my old chrome back. I don’t see a place to fix this. The word SHORTCUTS appears on the small window in chromes opening screes and I don’t need or want that. Cant find a place to remove it. The help menus on chrome.com is not helpful and I most definitely NEED HELP😢 | I don’t know how google works around all the privacy settings offered (and used) by Apple but it seems able to get everything it wants from information that should be protected. Don’t ever waste your time searching for something specific to view or change because the simplest help search results in no relevant context regardless of how you reword it or dumb it down. Zero credibility there and of course you can click on the link saying it’s not relevant or helpful 1000 times but you can’t find a link or human being that can help. It’s gonna go and I’m going to try to get all my information to something more reliable than google. | Well Google almost has the answer to everything lol | No, I see google almost everywhere I don’t want to see it here. | Great | In your matter in your security I just been careful I know you are everywhere ❤️👌 | Logging in is difficult. | This app is so awesome 😎 and it has to many websites to visit 📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺 | Terrible | Works very well, and takes me anywhere I need to go, no complaints here | No, I do not want to sign in to my google account everywhere

Update: Google, quit being evil | Unable to access 3rd party keyboards. | User friendly search engine | No me because I would like some support so far I have not had any . I’m very angry that google has allowed a USB security key on all of my accounts I have told them time and time again I do not have a USB security key. That I have a fingerprint passkey I have no interest In USB security key either | This is the best thing you can do when getting a new computer or phone. Chrome keeps up with all your bookmarks no matter what device you sign into Chrome on. Tabs are easy to manage, it is just a better browser. 

I feel like I have my own computer or phone no matter what device I’m on. Google open on chrome is like having the Internet at your fingertips! | Good | Chrome has been going downhill on my devices for a while now. Sometimes images just don’t load, the entire app freezes and I have to restart it, sometimes going back and forward in the browser don’t work correctly. Sometimes websites just don’t load, while they do on safari. It’s becoming a real hassle. | Thanks for the great job and your informative review of what you did. | Ads on mobile websites are too intrusive and distracting. Enough is enough, we need support for ad blocking extensions in the Google search app and in the mobile chrome browser on iOS. Also work with mobile websites to enforce more user-friendly standards for advertisements. That or ranked them lower in the search results and news feed. I constantly use the Google feed and then just open these websites in Safari using the share sheet, since Safari supports ad-blocking extensions. And yes, I know Google’s business model is advertising based. But you have to enforce good behavior in ads around the web because the experience is now like MySpace. | What is a search anymore but an opportunity for Google to get paid. Absolute trash, can’t wait until AI eats Google’s lunch. | 抖音 | It’s kinda really slow | Despite the app being a bit slow at times, the most detrimental thing to my user experience is that I will leave a tab open to return to, only to find it has rearranged itself somewhere within the other tabs. It makes it difficult to find the one I’m searching for, especially when I have 80+ tabs open. Please just leave them in chronological order!! | Haven’t been using it much so I can’t really give a rating on it | Total invasion of your privacy. Literally everything you do is collected and monetized. | I should be able to open more than 5 or 6 tabs before they all stop rendering and go blank, but I can’t. 

Google also seems to be making it harder to use the app, forcing you to spend more time looking for what you opened it up for. This is for the advertisers benefit to maximize googles ad revenue. The changes are not to make browsing faster or better for the users. | Instead of swiping to move between private mode and shared tabs, provide users with the option to choose whether swiping closes the page or switches between modes. | Do you have computer bugs or viruses? | For some reason Imgur doesn't work even in incognito mode. | Usually like chrome but putting this shortcuts bar on my home screen and not giving me an option to remove it going to cause me to delete the app and just use safari. I do not want this whatsoever. Please fix asap before I completely removed chrome | I have always loved google chrome but ever since I started the college search process I have many different college websites open, but I hate the fact that I can’t group these tabs on my phone. Wish this was an option for phone users | Browser opening normally during business hours yesterday June 7, 2023 for few hours just to be crushing after few hours of use by 5-6 PM EST and not Opening at all and Crushing on Start since MAY, 2023! Doesn't Restart - Crushes on Latest iOS on iPad Pro on May 24, 2023 even before Latest iOS was uploaded. Today on June 2, 2023 updated Google Apps but Chrome is not restarting and DOESN'T OPEN AT ALL & not usable.  No FIX for 2 Years?  Also SERIOUS DATA HOGGER! | Probably because I have no idea where to start but this was my last time doing it this way?? Everything was just so much easier 
than it seems to have ever felt. The only…..only..way we could have had a better life without him, and the rest of the “family time”is just as valuable to me now STILL HAS NO IDEA HOW MUCH MORE OF HIS OWN LIFE IS HIS LIFE AND HIS OWN RIGHT NOW IS THE ONE THAT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN DO WHAT HE CAN DO TO. (because of the way we are now in this.)So any chance that we will be together for life to get to a point STILL.™️ You, your sister and your brother have been doing the best job you could do in your new role as the leader of your first generation of leadership in your new position as leader in your current position and your aunt TiTi and understanding riches power to make a better person in this new role that you have been in your past role as my first love, but now that first love has been born without a single word you will never know what would ever feel like a lot easier than… to understand is when you and I have a very different and very important conversation about our good understanding relationship, when you’ll both know what we both are very much in this position of power given that you have been together for the same time they have always been too. Vivian and Bryce.. have to do this and you know how you have a good relationship with the best way to do this is by having 2 siblings together with each other’s parents to blame. You know what you can be proud of? original idea is a lot more important but I have to agree with your statement that you should have the right idea of the time for 7th grades  inn school to get their own place firstborn, to learn more of what you do in your own time, too. You can also pay attention to your own personal time and space for that time to be spent learning to be more active in school and not being afraid to take on more responsibility in the world than your parents do and the fact that is still a big challenge for your future. And in your own life as well as the present time to be able to make sure you pay attention to the present past and future as your lil sister and brother are doing well as they have been through this whole time you know that I am so proud to be your mom and mommy, to learn more of the things you want to be able to teach them about. When we were on our way to the Wednesdays we had to leave the house to get to the houses. We didn’t have to do anything but we were in a lot more than we could handle and it took us about 2yrs to find a new understanding that we were in this mess that was really difficult to deal with at that time because of the way things had to change so quickly and we didn’t know how to do things at all but we were in this situation we were so much more than a bit more prepared for the time that we needed to be together so it took us and we didn’t really know what we needed until we had to do it. We just didn’t know when we had to be able to get the house back together and we didn’t have the space for a little while so we had to go back to our old place and put a new one on top of the 2 yrs later was not even thought we had to be apart from that time period we had Wednesdays. I love you so much baby for being so nicer to Vivian and Bryce too. Try! My love, my first born son is my best boy… and I ever had the opportunity to MY FIRST EVER BEING BORN WITH YOU BILLY JR. is mommy too!!! 💙™️💭🎶💬💙💙 | I use this browser to use YouTube a lot. Chrome is my favorite web browser. I can’t use it on PC because of the parental controls they put on there. | So many different customizable features along with tons using the entire device! | Truly masters at what you do | I went right to it and it said I took too long | Works just not syncing between devices so can pickup elsewhere | We have been using Dropbox for 10 years as a resource for all of our choreography and performances and have never been left without content, research material, or favorite memories!

I can't see my recent history | I really like the news aggregation of the app. However, as I am scrolling and reading through news stories it will randomly update the whole feed and I lose the other interesting articles on my feed. This happens so randomly it’s quite annoying. Sometimes when I am reading or if I leave the app for 1 second to take care of another notification. When I come back I watch as the app decides it needs a refresh and watch all the news stories disappear in front of me.

I never experienced this problem until a month or two ago. 

Is it a glitch in the app or is there something in settings to correct this that I’m not finding?

Otherwise I love the Google app along with many of my other Google services! If this issue is resolved I’d give the app 5 stars.

Enough is enough, we need support for ad blocking extensions in the Google search app and in the mobile chrome browser on iOS. Also work with mobile websites to enforce more user-friendly standards for advertisements. That or ranked them lower in the search results and news feed. I constantly use the Google feed and then just open these websites in Safari using the share sheet, since Safari supports ad-blocking extensions. And yes, I know Google’s business model is advertising based.

Also, if you need to switch between two different phone numbers, it will start sending you notifications for both and you can’t change that setting. | Hey developers - what about possibilities to adjust opening Z-Box (or what’s the name for pickup packages person-less) functionality? 1) I want to open it even I am not in front of that box (because someone else could wait there and bring it to me) 2) I want to “transfer” responsibility of that delivery to other person completely and (s)he can pick it up anytime (s)he want. I believe that’s only partially political decision ;)

Wow great! Well - not too much - I am in different time zone - is your customer support awake ? Hardly at work now. And - do you already accept calling via data? Whatsapp or Signal (even better)? Ah no? Maybe space for improvements?

Please allow editing of messages for a longer time | WhatsApp is widely used to communicate internationally, thus it is bewildering that it still does not have a translation feature.

Awful when you are in a hurry. Sticking to Apple Maps. | Trying to road trip, Google maps is always reliable. This trip it keeps changing our route to another route that’s 45 minutes longer and has tolls. WHY. Also, my estimated arrival time is missing. I can’t do math across time zones to figure out what time is 12 hours 45 minutes from now. HELP. | Love the way the directions are spoken to direct me to locations. | There should be a spot on the map for those who are moving. A spot ware you tell it that you are towing and able to set a max speed such as 55mph for better time accuracy towards your destination. | App is a actually a good app to use and find places The only down side is that it leads you the far way to get to your destination otherwise it’s really good. | App seems glitchy lately. Two things:

1. Arrow gets stuck at starting point after leaving

2. Ghost routes keep popping up in areas where there isn’t a road(ie. Non existing roads going through houses) | Coco loco was amazing would homey recommend this place as long as he is here . He was amazing and awesome.. | I’d rather use Waze 💀 | Everyone was very nice and professional! Hagan’s vibrant energy is very refreshing and welcoming. Everyone is AMAZING!!! Thank you for the experience | I met with Michelle today. She was great, very calm, patient, welcoming, encouraging and supportive. She took her time, showing me around the facility and answered all of my questions. I am excited to begin my wellness journey at LA Fitness. | They cancelled an appointment that took two months to get one hour prior to the appointment. 

Their morning job was terminated so they called to move if possible 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the appointment. I could not accommodate so they cancelled an hour prior by leaving a voice message.

Stated excuse was due to the square footage of the house. If that is true they have very faulty procedural issues in screening their appointments.

All on a beautiful mid day Friday READ suspect as well as extremely unprofessional wanting a long weekend. | As always the service was excellent Garrett was professional, courteous and extremely knowledgeable about termites and Centricon.  My dog Sweety would give thumbs up too if she had thumbs.  Keep up the good work. | scam | The best maintenance guy that we ever had. Would recommend him | It would be really cool if the app didn’t close out all the time. Like every day I’ll be using it, maybe I’m estimating how long it will take me to get somewhere while sitting in my home. I’ll open the app, walk to my car and suddenly poof, it’s closed, forgotten the address and I’m back to square one as I sit in my car. Or I’ll pull over on a drive to get gas, and again poof it’s gone again. It’s so dumb. 

Or and being able to copy and paste like a normal computer would be LIFE CHANGING. | This app can be dangerous to use while driving. For example, you can’t turn up the volume of the narrator at any time. You have to do it while the narrator is speaking the directions which makes you constantly taking your eyes off the road in preparation to turn up the volume. This is how it works on the iPhone. | Never lets me down. | In general, this app works very well. It gets me where I need to go, and it lets me know when there's an incident ahead and how to get around it generally. But why does it do weird things like take me off an exit, then straight through and back onto the interstate I was just on? That can be very frustrating when you don't know where you're going, and all you have is map to depend on.
Also, can you please tell me why there are praying hands on my map reviews? why would anyone be praying for me. | This is the best pizza lace on Stagecoach Rd. The staff is Amazing and completely awesome Sauce!💜Thanks for Blessing my family🙏💜 | Ok, this is a one-off! But, based on principle I feel the need to share. I’m sure many of you have been treated unfairly as a consumer and have tried to get some sort of satisfaction from these large companies but, to no avail! 
My issue is with the AMC 
Theater.  Last December I purchased a gift card from the AMC Theater at Randhurst Mall for my wife for a Xmas gift. $100
The lady who handled the transaction was clearly having a hard time… I should’ve made her show me the money on the card before i left.  Fast forward to February 2024 when my wife and her friend went to the AMC to enjoy a movie… and there’s no funds available!  I’ve reached out to AMC in multiple ways and they seem to not care! 
I will never step foot in an AMC theater again unless they make it right! If any of you would like to join me in my boycott of all AMC 
theaters please feel free!
Thank you 😡 | Best gym and very helpful community is very supportive and clean gym | Tracy Wheeler couldn’t have been more helpful in assisting us with the purchase and set up of our new IPhones. She was most knowledgeable, efficient and courteous. | Big brother is watching you | Google, you need to stay out of politics and quit trying to influence elections. Let the people decide if you’re going to post new stories be fair and balanced not just conservatives are bad and liberals are great other than that I like your maps. | Whenever I click directions on the web it brings me to the app store and then I have to click on the app again but it doesn’t copy the address to it. It use to take me directly to google maps when i clicked directions in the web. Please fix this | This shop services all 4 of our minis. I trust them a lot. Best shop I have worked with. | When I do a Google search and a business comes up and I press directions Google asked if I want to open the app. In the past the address was popped into the app now when the app opens the address is not there, I have to go back to the website, then hit back a few times try to copy the address most of the time it just keeps opening up a map, this is poor design | My technician Daniel Harris was very professional and thorough.He explained all that he had done and told me everything was good. I was very pleased with his performance.Mildred Petty | Your soup taste like it has been there in the pot for a few days. Does not taste good at all. | I literally do not like this app every time I need to use it it has got to be updated. It is so freaking aggravating. | I wish I could get this app off my phone as all it does is spam my phone as I pick address from google and I use the google map direction and every time it sends me to the App Store to either update once again or open and it never works. Then try to back to webpage and the App Store keeps popping up so have to close browser down and start over. | It’s a great app, but one very excruciating issue that haven’t been fixed yet is that when you zoom in the map, sometimes the screen would teleport elsewhere, so minus three stars for that.",4.68635,48445,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/b5/be/87/b5be87da-53e8-61d5-f1dd-814cb333f355/74160742-e1a8-459b-a514-8fac67272708_0_APP_IPHONE_55_0.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/5d/34/fd/5d34fded-1d3d-af33-a8a0-5931e061f60c/31cb35d3-9d8d-4b97-8ec2-475770a1f740_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/79/48/52/794852d7-50ea-02e3-8b52-e028a6e1635e/a24a86b9-6d5d-4012-a93e-cff5eca6e834_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/3a/8f/b5/3a8fb5cd-e0a2-0d6c-60fb-f41a0ffa5bbb/4fc204ca-0c67-4cef-8a19-1e46a808d917_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/d5/3a/a0/d53aa078-9698-a862-61ea-b436ad32ed3b/92d0cacd-4c88-4205-ab4d-c056c775e090_4_APP_IPHONE_55_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/64/34/f0/6434f0d7-2590-5d96-db5c-f5f49a24b161/12408197-bffc-42c9-bd75-3260ce7726ce_5_APP_IPHONE_55_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/46/07/4a/46074a44-9376-db2c-a586-1d0172c88278/6a6a10f1-188a-404d-8ffb-2292f49b965b_6_APP_IPHONE_55_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/09/83/0e/09830e9d-c4cb-eb4c-9a8a-5aa6e7a98fe5/dba002ab-315c-4db1-b743-15e3a669bf9d_7_APP_IPHONE_55_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/ee/fb/94/eefb9495-5576-4ca5-a321-f4eb31e11a87/edcc54ba-3ca9-47c6-998f-741312ad9a2b_8_APP_IPHONE_55_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/d2/68/7b/d2687b2d-e392-2aea-247c-b9b3cdfd8e95/2b252d51-e873-4d40-a286-2e37c04c7de9_0_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_0.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/2a/03/36/2a0336c3-bf37-2fac-42db-e5a88321e4d0/f0334ab6-3be4-470f-95fd-37f067dbe693_1_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/c6/11/b1/c611b158-f8c0-5bcf-a78d-957e6df53930/8f5a4670-ade2-4f08-86a0-566f4d706bb1_2_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/38/a8/c6/38a8c6a9-325a-c89d-6044-3d5fbfd3b3ff/69b994ed-4bec-416c-b546-379266c73568_3_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProM

Tnx | Niezbędna aplikacja zakupowa była, jest i będzie…. | I would give this app 5 stars if there were English version | Allegro to najlepsza aplikacja, podebrałem telefon tacie i kupiłem lego za kilka stówek, teraz czekam na paczuszki pod paczkomatem | Wyszukiwarka jest na niskim poziomie , bardzo czesto wyszukiwanie wpisanej rzeczy odbiega od tej rzeczy , trzeba precyjnie okreslic co sie chce kupic bo wychodza bzdury , np.na ebay jak wpisze g....no to pojawia sie sedesy itp.akcesoria a na allegro to Bog jedyny raczy wiedziec co algorytmy allegro wymysla , ale na pewno nie sedesy i to jest najwiekszy feler tej aplikacjji.Poza tym jest ok, towar dostarczany jest szybko , moge sie przyczepic do funkcji ,,smart,, , bo jestem przyzwyczajony do ,,amazon prime,, , ale z czasem moze i allegro do tego dojdzie.pozdrawiam i jednak moze popracujcie nad wyszukiwarka . | Polecam i przedmioty bardzo piekne- jak w opisie. | Ma 66 lat i nie mam problemu ze zmiana miejsca dostawy lub przekierowania oraz zmian metod płacenia.

Ukryte koszty na każdym kroku „wystaw za darmo” to oszustwo. Wypłata własnych środków trwa ponad tydzień i kosztuje. Interfejs aplikacji niby jednolity ze stroną, ale wszystko gdzie indziej.

All is so clear and self explanatory.
5stars for efficiency . | Walić że nikt nie zaimplementował poprawnego wyświetlania w aplikacji, otworzymy przeglądarkę i git. Ale 10% bierem. Chcecie iść w wojenkę z Bezosem? Proszę bardzo, chętnie skorzystam z ofert amazonu.

I hate this “you have a new message”! I don’t need to open the app every time any junk comes into my inbox. Please, fix this problem.

I recommend it …100 /. | Great service Always! | I love Gmail, I always recommend people to use gmail! | If I can’t preview my email from the notification banner on my Lock Screen anymore, then I will turn off the app notifications altogether and check my emails the old fashion way. This new update that forces me to open the app every single time is anti productive. Not every email I receive needs my immediate attention, so I don’t always open them right away. However, there are a few that require special attention and I can no longer differentiate between important and nonessential emails with the new notifications system. Therefore, I am turning off notifications altogether and I will check all of my emails at the same time; which is when I get to them! Edit: Newest update fixed the problem. Google, seriously don’t do that again. That was so annoying, I even considered switching to yahoo mail (🤮). There is a reason people use your service and not others, don’t ruin it for yourselves. | I am having real trouble getting back my original “gmail” account!!! It keeps sending me to a u tube app to confirm who I am! And to tap on a code sent to me!!! But no where on u tube app does it allow for entering any codes!!! Very frustrating😢 | This app has always been perfectly fine, but just recently it has stopped showing the previews in my notifications of what the email is. I have not changed any of my phone’s settings and made sure they are correct, so I don’t know why this is happening, just that it is incredibly inconvenient.

This app would be five stars if not for this issue. Please do look into this. Thank you! | Love Google! | Nice to know people care about others. God Bless & Thank You | Super great at deleting critical reviews and not improving their product for 20 yrs. | Paying for the $2/month plan and i had a lapse due to forced-odd schedule for a month. KEEP IN MIND IF YOU PAY FOR STORAGE AND LOSE FOR NONPAYMENT, it is possible to NEVER receive an email sent during this period. Even after clearing space and coming back to fix payment, an important email i was expecting will now never come through. I get other emails, but I'm not getting the one i NEEDED again i guess, Sadly the site I'm needing doesn't have a ""re-send email"" option so I'm just S.O.L. there bc of a greedy corporations paywall | Ease of use makes life less stressful 😁 | The new update eliminated the message preview on the Apple Watch rendering the app much less useful. Hopefully this will be resolved quickly or I will need to switch all my emails to another provider. | If you like looking at a giant exclamation point with the word error written below - this is the app for you! | I often get notifications on the app that aren’t actually emails. Like, it shows that there’s a message but when I click on the app everything is read. It’s confusing and they don’t usually go away unless I restart my phone. | I really like the gmail app | Newest update messed up the vertical centering/alignment of the Home Screen widget. Please fix!!!  Looks terrible. | No, I do not want to sign in to google account everywhere I go

Update: quit being evil | This app suite ang fit may personalities | Working great. | This app works ok, I can get and send emails, but how does it not have a “mark all read” feature in 2024?! And this is *only* an issue on the iphone version, WHY? | Every email received it adds a contact even though I disabled it on a browser.

No simple way to delete contacts. Huge pain in the butt.

Yet, app is required for authentication. Another pain. | Trying to merge old gmail accounts isn't working or it acts like nothing happened after clicking merge accounts and logging into the second account. | The browser and app reset frequently.
You lose a lot of progress on something if you do that. | Por más que borro y borro correos nada que libera espacio , lo único que sale es que page más y más dinero cada vez | Ok | I need to clear my account mail! It’s not trashing it!! And it’s to much junk mail!! | Text hasn’t been showing randomly for emails when sent. Somehow others are seeing them. If I copy and paste it I can see it in another app. Fix this bug please! | In the latest update, they’ve included a feature where you no longer can see a preview of the message on your Lock Screen, thus forcing you into the app to view any content whatsoever. 

This artificially will boost their user sessions and overall user time in app, where it hadn’t before but is a significant detriment to the overall user experience.

There seems to be no way in settings to revert it to previously, and as a result has me looking for alternative mail apps. | For the past month or so, I have had the gmail page go black and the only way I can fix it is to delete the app and redownload it! What’s going on? Don’t try to blame my internet source because this only happens with gmail! Fix it please!
After hearing from gmail support on how to take care of the problem, I’ve upgraded my review.  However, it’s only been 2 days with no problems.  I hope it continues.  Thank you support. | The dark mode setting of Gmail always follows the iPhone system and cannot be turned off (I would expect options between on/off/follow system) . The fact that Gmail didn’t keep this simple and useful feature is beyond understanding. Please bring it back! | This new update is awful. Definitely pushing me towards a different platform if it doesn’t go back to being able to preview the message without accessing the app. This has to be the dumbest thing to come up with when your phone settings allow you to choose if you want a preview or not. Why did google change it. Awful!! | nice. | Stop making me open the app and let me see my email notifications | The latest update broke notifications so that they only display “You have a new message,” making them functionally useless noise. | I decided to start using Gmail on my iPhone for personal emails instead of Hotmail, but have encountered problems using it that I’ve never had with Hotmail. 
First, when composing an email, you can’t swipe it down to refer to another email in your inbox. You have to copy what you’ve typed, tap X to cancel the new email, look at the other email to get your information and then start your email over again by pasting onto a new email because it often doesn’t save the draft of the email I started.
Second, it’s more difficult to copy a photo in the body of your email or add as an attachment. Sometimes it will do neither and ask to add it as a file or on Google Drive.
Third, and most importantly, it seems to have nowhere near the storage capacity as Hotmail. I’ve used Hotmail for over ten years and never had a notification that I was running out of storage and that I should buy more. I’ve only used Gmail for about five years and I’m getting the notification that I have 83% of my storage used. I also have Google Photos app, so that may have contributed to that, but I have a number of photos and recordings on Hotmail too. The storage issue is the reason I am going back to Hotmail. | “You have a new message” | Google chat isn’t easy to navigate | This guy was so mad 😡 and then proceeded with a video and then I was in my bed 🛏️ crying 😿 because of his poor posture.. | Never any space/storage yet when I try to go through my emails to delete a few, no new emails are appearing. I’ve had gmail since 2017 and never had problems with storage. 

Don’t bother creating a new email because they will link it to any of your google accounts, then you have the same storage issues. Bye gmail hello yahoo. No thank you I don’t want to pay for extra

This company is full of thieves. Fraudulent charges on my account, proof from the company that the charges were fraudulent and they still refuse to refund my money. | Sad though because I can’t reorder my daughters card that never arrived.. when I try it says I need to update my app which I do and have and it doesn’t change to much about being able to reorder it … anyways besides that I have shared the app a couple times… we will see if I can order one for her eventually! | I travel internationally, use the exchange, spend online and in stores, transfer funds, kids accounts, etc. This card works instantly with very little fees that you pay for the convenience of having all banking options in 1 place. | It’s perfect for anyone to send, they accept all currencies & it’s super easy. Way better then PayPal thank you! | Why doesn’t Revolut pay interest on money in peoples account like normal banks? Best keep substantial funds in a real bank account. | this is the worst app i’ve ever used. i got it to make international transfers and they let me put money into my account but would clear my verification. my money is still sitting in the app and they won’t let me use it. been in contact with the via chat for more than a week and all they ever say is “we will contact you when we have an update” but nothing ever happens. they won’t even go into detail about any issue. just empty apologies. i even contacted them via social DMs and it’s the same thing. they just switch out who’s helping you and every one says the same thing. DO NOT USE THIS USELESS APP.

hoping to get my money off this app but it really doesn’t feel like i will. insane scam | App keeps telling me to download new version and upgrade app. New version is downloaded however, it will not let me order a virtual card for my son. | It is 20 years further than the rest Dutch bank apps. Love it! 

Sure it has many many thinga to improve. Wish the best! | Opened an account so my less than responsible teen could have a “safer” debit card. I’ve ordered the <18 card for him three times and waited over two months and still no card. Even after it was supposedly expedited. I’ll take my business elsewhere. I’ve contacted customer support several times with no resolution. | I like Revolut as a second Bank account so you have a backup. The app works and transfers are usually fast. But the trading part of the app is not good at all. Missing searches for ETFs, confusing interface, ongoing redraw issues when you scroll down a list. | One of the best designed apps I have used. Easy to execute almost all banking functions. Only issue is that document upload can be cumbersome on mobile and the web/desktop portal provides near 0 functionality so you are forced to do it all on mobile. | Can’t get into my account on app. Reset pin text or email never comes through, no phone call with pin ever comes through. Automated Phone number says use app chat. Can’t login!! Email support says to reset password and get text or email, which never comes through. This also means they completely ignored me when I said no option works. Can’t call to check my balance, says to go use the app. No human to talk to. This company has completely checked out and has failed their customers by pretty much saying “ehh too bad” and shrugging you off. Cool logo for a “bank” I guess. Moved my paychecks to a new bank and all is well. Never using this again once I get my money out, if they EVER actually help me login. 0/5 stars. | This app encourages the use of fraudulent activity. They aiding and abetting such activity. When reported they do very little, if anything at all. | I bought £5k of btc and it went to £5.6k and I wanted to sell and move my money back into savings and when I hit sell they say I'll only get £5.5k 

They take a £100 fee???? They already took around £60 when i initially bought so I had to wait for BTC to go up like 2% before breaking even... now its more like 4% when you consider the fees on both ends

Use coinbase and pay for coinbase pro. 

Bear in mind I also have revolut premium! £55 a month! and they still charge me these kinds of fees? Extortionate. Goodbye. I'm moving my BTC to Coinbase and cancelling my Premium account | I just read some guy said this is the worst banking app ever.

I have used a lot of banking apps and this one is awesome! So many useful features. I have their prepaid credit card and it is the only card I use. This card does everything and then some. Far and away the most full featured banking app I have used. Usually, at restaurants I get the charge on my phone before the waiter returns to the table. | I have multiple citizenships, so I want to have an account for each one of my nationalities, well, they don’t allow it. What a bunch of idiots, I hope they will go out of business soon. | I have tried several ways to deposit money into the account and it is impossible. | I love this card, I’ve used it for a travel abroad for the last three years. 
I can keep my local currency on it and usually had BPS and Euros on it too. It’s so easy, love it! | Arrives in minutes for transfers to bank accounts in Europe using SEPA transfer method. Need to be careful though when sending money because there is not many steps to check review your payment order when sending to someone already in your Payee List. | The old version 10.14 works on my phone, but I need the updated version to use the app | Not worth the hoops you have to go thru to simply get a good exchange rate. Oversold. | Read the one star reviews. A nightmare. Not only do they take your money- in my case a small amount- but they take all your personal information, including drivers license, passport and biometric data. Then lock the account and doing let you close it. My mistake. Hope you don’t make it too | They simply cannot deliver on any of the items offered in the app.  I simply feel like I have been lied to and told stories in an effort to get fees and money and more fees.  Almost 100% of what they say is not going to happen.  The card is trash and the app is clunky and the bulk of people you can speak with have absolutely no clue what to do except to say this word—NO!
They actually work to not help people become better at any level.  If we lived in Communist China this is a perfect app to use. | I’ve been using Revolut since I’ve move to London and it helps me keep track of my bills in the UK and the States. Simple to use and I love my little custom card I got back in 2022. It keeps getting better with the updates and it’s so nice to see a company grow. Keeps me money conscious and not anxious. 

Also love their spare change option, has helped me safe money in case things have gotten rough monetary wise and it has. 

10/10 recommend to anyone who travels a lot. | I was a Spanish student living in the US. So therefore this was an entire problem because of my American phone number but Spanish documents. They kept telling me I couldn’t use my Spanish passport to register even though it has my face and name on it, it had to be my Spanish ID card which had been long expired.
I finally got my social so I thought I would create a new account using my American info and when registering it wouldn’t send the text. I deleted the app and after redownloading it, it doesn’t allow me to open the app, just keeps saying to try again later no matter how many times I try to redownload it.
The worst part is they don’t have a contact number and say if you want to contact someone to do it via the app which, as stated previously, will not allow me to enter so complete waste of my time. | We have had a Revolut account for quite some time. They really leveled up with the under 18 accounts and the family sharing. I love the app for so many reasons. It is so easy to transfer money between my classic bank account as well as others on Revolut.  I like to track where my kids spend their money😊- love the pockets and the categorization of spending. My CS account doesn’t track any spending via categorizations. It is crazy how behind the high street banks are! | So far, so good, I want to know how this bank does things, I’m curious, I do like the metal card. See if we can get some incentives! | To keep my account they asked me for more information than even the IRS knows. Like my picture, and ID picture of license or passport. I gave my personal picture, but when they asked for the aid picture I knew that they were really after all the peoples money who couldn’t or wouldn’t supply the info. Revolut just stole millions from innocent people! | This is what a banking app should be - amazing UX, great features and amazingly low fees. Love it. | Simple, effective, perfect UI, low fees for payments and international transfers | Please fire the design team that made v10. Lots of UI elements no longer accessible on single tap, lots of UI elements more difficult to access because they are moved to upper parts of the screen. Whoever deisgned this should be fired on the spot. | I was scammed $200 & the employees do nothing to help you. In fact they took more money from me where I am now out in the negative. They refuse to resolve anything | Thieves love to use it because it's secure for them. Worst experience in my life through this app. | I just put my money into direct deposit for this bank.I lost access to my phone number and email.So I can’t sign on I email support and they tell me to go to chat and I sent in everything I had to
Send and they tell me to
Go
To
Chat how can you chat and you can’t sign on.I want my account changed once my money starts going in I’m changing banks again not putting up
With this | I got this app because it was recommended to me for international travel. I opted for the Premium plan and ordered a chromatic card which was around $20 or so.

Three weeks later, the card has not arrived. So I proceeded to try to reach customer service via chat which is a perk of the Premium plan. Low and behold, there is no customer service live chat feature in their help bar so you have to wait for a response email from an inexistent support team. Even after sending an email, common protocol is to receive a confirmation email. However, Revolut doesn’t have that, meaning your message may or may not have reached them. No way of knowing. 

Also, be aware that there is no phone number to call. For a bank in the United States to not have a customer service phone number is a huge red flag.

If you have funds left in the app, there is no way to withdraw them without having the card, which once again they didn’t send. So, essentially you are stuck having money in a mysterious bank account without any customer support and you watch it get drained by the monthly premium fees. Another huge red flag.

If you terminate the premium plan early, they charge $19.98. So basically, you pay $20 for a card and $19.98 for early termination of premium plan, you cannot get your money back and you have no way to speak to somebody in order to get help. Imagine getting stuck in a foreign country being at the mercy of Revolut - it would be a total nightmare! This is a total SCAM so please do not fall for this. 

I am reporting this company to the FDIC. I hope this helps any of you readers to avoid getting scammed like I did. | DO NOT USE THIS APP, genuinely have never been more disgusted by a company that claims to be a financial institution. Revolut is fine until it’s not. No customer support, no security. Money will be stolen from you on here and no one will help. Terrible customer service- the chat is the only way to contact them and it is very likely it is AI generated.

UPDATE: no one reads your messages. No one communicates. The complaints team will ghost you and gaslight you. I have actively been lied to by many of the agents. There is a fine line they are walking and I would be shocked if this app continues for more than a few more years at most. This is a lawsuit and a press release waiting to happen. Utterly disgusting and unprofessional. Shame on you. | Please add support for Costa Rican Colones. Costa Rica is one of the most heavily visited places on earth for eco- tourism yet someone you cannot pay in colones. Similar apps such as wise offer this. | El sistema muy fácil de manejar ! Segura y práctica | I brought some Bitcoin a while ago on this app, and revolut liquidated it for a 55% loss on October 1st without any notice. Screw this app. | Very very bad banking app ever | As a suggestion, it’s a bit hard to find your orders (like limit orders, stop orders etc.) and accessing the Converter is also very difficult. 

Very good app in general. | Run. Dont do it.  Need negative stars. | Even after charging my account with a specific amount, they kept withdrawing money from my bank account and not reflecting it on my account within their app! Fraudulent transactions! | I’m not using this app because I don’t like having a passcode on my phone. You have a code to get into any app (just like any app with important info), you don’t need more than that. Oh well! | I can’t even pass the ID verification step. I tried submitting my ID, my passport, I tried installing it in different phones, using natural light to take the picture and it keeps telling me that they were unable to verify my ID. All the information I submitted is correct. I found in Google that many people are having the same issue and looks they haven’t bothered to fix it. Customer no service is just that, no service. | DO NOT USE THIS APP
I was homeless in another country and I needed money, and I checked when I was supposed to get the money and it said a week later. needed it NOW or I had to sleep at a bus stop and I ended up sleeping at a bus stop. a week later, I’m back in my own country and I check to get my money and it said there was technical issues so long story short they Stole $80 USD. DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!! | Just had to write that Revolut has come in handy for me during my travels over the years. I’ve never had problems using this card anywhere. And the features help me feel secure that my $$$ is safe. Transfers are also awesome and super easy. | How do I unsubscribe? | Not only lacking in basic features, their customer service has no knowledge, not even an answer to the simplest questions. Like all customer service department at every app, they promise to get back to you in a specific amount of time with a solution, it never happens. It’s just a way to quit the session with an angry customer. | Do not use this company they will steal your money under the disguise that your account is been restricted for no reason at

EX: Der Mann, Die Frau.  And the problem with this is that whenever I get asked to spell a sentance that has „ ein/eine“ I cannot for the life of me tell the difference. (I can’t tell the difference when it’s an animal.) It’s driving me MAD. Please put a hint telling me if the animal is a guz or girl.. | This app gives me a good start on easy and familiar words I use daily, the assignments are at your own pace and you can level up when you get through the different task. They do have you watching short ads if you didn’t pay but  It’s free so the ads are worth it. It’s been almost 2 weeks and I’m feeling more confident with the short amount of time I’ve actually familiarized myself with Spanish words by sight and sound | Love that’s it’s free and enjoy the testing of skills! | There are some errors to the best of my knowledge such as vah is used for those 
At convenience you can review | Omg I love this app !!! 5 stars duo !!! | In my opinion it’s a good place to learn or practice languages | I love this app, it’s helping me learn different languages! :) (duo please set my family free now) | I just broke my 2 year streak and I see a van outside of my house and it looks like the doulingo bird | I love duolingo solves my problems a lot | I really enjoy using this app to learn some Italian words and phrases.  I wish there was a way they could incorporate more of the “rules” (like that the adjective goes AFTER the noun) BEFORE you get testes on it. I also think that some of the enunciations and pronunciations could be improved on. There are a lot of times I can’t hear the “e.”  And I wish it were a bit less sensitive with misspellings (i.e. cafe vs caffe). Would be nice if there were more ways to earn hearts without spending so many jewels. | Me encanta esta aplicación | It is a very helpful game to kids or not that good with other languages and maybe if their parent speaks a different language and they can’t seem to figure that language out then they just go one Duolingo and it really help that is the reason why I think Duolingo is the best app I ever played 

Good job to who ever created this app. It is very helpful to me and other kids.#Adults. | Duolingo is helping me communicate with my grandma now it is way better communicating with other people and I can speak to my friends and students in Spanish if they don’t understand me please join Duolingo it helps. it helps a lot. Thanks, Duolingo. | This app is amazing! You can learn any language 5 stars! You should get Duolingo | Duo is the best if your reading this get it I was learning Vietnamese and when I went to Vietnam everyone understood me 
Download today!!! | I must’ve typed “I don’t want to work in China” in Spanish a hundred times. Now all I want to do is work in China. Thanks duo! | There are quite a few glitches still in the Spanish language. Also, it doesn’t structure well for the type of learning. The daily lessons really don’t help with the weak areas. | I have such a hard time with memory! The diagnosis of ADD and OCD has carried on through adulthood, this program has made it easier to learn a tough language such as German because it’s FUN! | I love the app because it teaches you how to speak all different languages and is fun to learn it has a quick lesson a day and there are cool little games and pictures to learn you can right a sentence in the different language so you should get it you will love it 5star | Your program doesn’t teach verbs well at all | Is so good I really liked how is showing me these easy lessons it could be hard but you will understand | I love this so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😅🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🙏 | I forgot to do my Japanese lesson. I heard a knock on my door 5 mins later. And they asked me if I wanted to see a magic trick. I said “sure?” And poof there went my family 

(THIS IS A JOKE DO NOT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY OR PERSONAL) it is a good app tho | You are really helping me learn a language, Gracias | A few weeks in and and was loving it then they brought out the political agendas. I was about to buy a year sub. Delete. | Learn so quickly, easy words, the best, definitely try it out | I really enjoy using Duolingo to learn Japanese and I think the system works extremely well for learning to speak it (I might need extra practice writing it on the side). 
The only dislike is related with the fact that all new words come at once at the beginning of a new unit  (difficult to retain) and then are repeated so many times that by the end of the unit one is bored to death with them. I see from my family members that it is not the same in their languages. Maybe this could be improved in Japanese? I think new words could be introduced more slowly, only a couple at a time. Would also give time to retain the hiragana and kanji. 
A couple of times I also had the impression that the English translation was not great (I am not a native speaker, but I have lived in the US 15+ years). For example instead of “by myself” I would often translate “on my own”. I have been penalized for putting time/day first in a sentence, which I think is mostly correct in English. Not a big deal but also easy enough to fix! | Gracias Duolingo por ayudarme a comunicarme con los demás | This app is amazing and it makes learning Spanish so easy! Can you please let go of my family now? I haven’t seen them in months😭😭😭 | I was able to keep my streak and my family does Duolingo too so all of us are safe… For now? Just hoping I don’t see a green owl at my door. | They claim they’ll send a notification 2 days before your free trial expires, but I never got one and was charged 84 DOLLARS. Absolutely shameful | Charged me a month of super before the 7th day was finished, so I really only got a 6 day trial period rather than the full 7. The Hawaiian language lessons are comically bad, from mic quality to options being sprinkled in like “49ers” and “bob marley”. Not worth your time, especially with the rumors going around that they may start using AI in their program. Don’t waste your time. | I have only been playing for about a few days and already learned so much i would recommend this app for people of all ages who want to learn a different language it is just super fun and helpful and i would recommend you consider giving it a try | Easy & convenient, it helps with so many different languages, math, and music. It’s not just your ordinary “language learning” app! ( duo please let my family go… I did my lessons. ) | It’s a very well made app that does its job well. My biggest problem is becoming motivated for like a week and then never opening the app again. Its hard to stay motivated to learn the new language (s) | Kill yourself | We’re is my family | I've found in the exercises that I've done that there are errors and lack of nuance. Worse, they have no customer support. Try to find a customer support email or phone number; non-existent. Not worth a dime. Much better apps out there with good customer support. Save your money. | Muncho buenas | I THINK ITS THE BEST BECAUSE IM LEARNING🩷🩷🩷❤️❤️❤️ | It is helpful every day when I need to learn Spanish and I love doing it it’s so fun so thanks to whoever made it😛😛😛😇😇😊☺️😝 | This app is incredibly competitive in a good way but also a bad way
I do a lesson and most of the time I DONT EVEN GET THE DANG XP it lags out and I get NO credit for doing the lesson at

Please fix this issue and I will change my review | When it say “Tu” I put Tu and it says “Pay attention to accents” and show Tú but if I do Tú they still say “Pay attention to accents” and show Tú so which is it Tu or Tú | Xd | I started this app on Friday and it’s currently Saturday and I already know how to say basic sentences like “Yo soy una nina”. I love how this app doesn’t rush it and keeps working on the same topic then slowly start adding new words like “Yo, una, un” and more. This app also once you finish your lesson for today you revisit the mistakes you made and use your new knowledge to answer them correctly.

Je určena pro všechny pojištěnce VZP, kteří s námi chtějí komunikovat elektronicky a nebaví je chodit na pobočku. Zaregistrovat můžete klidně celou svoji rodinu a z jednoho účtu kontrolovat údaje všech jejích členů.

Využívat služeb Moje VZP můžete:

Sami za sebe.
Za své děti.  
Jako opatrovník.

Jako zmocněnec například manžela, prarodičů, rodičů nebo kohokoli jiného, kdo vám k tomu dá úředně ověřenou plnou moc.

Co v aplikaci najdete? 

Přehled plátců zdravotního pojištění. Zkontrolujte si, kdo za vás platí pojistné na zdravotní pojištění. A kdo ho za vás platil v průběhu posledních 5 let.

Stav plateb zdravotního pojištění

Pokud sami za sebe platíte nebo jste někdy platili pojistné na zdravotní pojištění (jako OSVČ nebo OBZP), zkontrolujte si, jestli nemáte nějaké nedoplatky či nesrovnalosti v platbách.

Přehled o příjmech a výdajích OSVČ

Osobám samostatně výdělečně činným umožňujeme prostřednictví bonusové aplikace VZP Point podat přehled o příjmech a výdajích OSVČ bez nutnosti návštěvy naší pobočky či jeho zasílání poštou.

Přehled úhrad zdravotní péče

Zjistěte si, jakou zdravotní péči jste dle výkazů zdravotnických zařízení čerpali, a kolik tato péče stála. Můžete také upozornit na případné nesrovnalosti.

Poplatky a doplatky

Zkontrolujte si výši vašich započitatelných doplatků za léčivé přípravky a potraviny pro zvláštní lékařské účely s ohledem na zákonem stanovený ochranný limit, po jehož dovršení vám další doplatky budou v zákonné lhůtě vráceny.

Přístup k datům našich pojištěnců je možné zřídit pouze za předpokladu, že u nás mají aktivní pojištění (není ukončeno na základě pojištění v EU nebo dlouhodobého pobytu). Pro zřízení zástupu nemusíte být naším pojištěncem, ale budeme rádi, když se jím stanete.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/fe/d1/ba/fed1baff-d73c-0f3c-03d0-095e820d3e16/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-10-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Utilities""]","[""6002""]","Utilities",6002,"12+","[""CS""]","14556160","12.4","2019-06-12T17:44:50Z","2024-03-07T10:00:27Z","Oprava chyb a stability aplikace.","282",0,"CZK",true,1433571459,"Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna ČR","https://apps.apple.com/cz/developer/v%C5%A1eobecn%C3%A1-zdravotn%C3%AD-poji%C5%A1%C5%A5ovna-%C4%8Dr/id1433571459?uo=4",,2.26471,"",2.26471,170,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/96/37/23/96372342-f3cf-dfcc-c691-c12c307185f9/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ad/74/62/ad7462b9-b2f4-9b38-3663-b89e1e3924cc/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/64/d7/4c/64d74cd6-2d97-04a1-ffd4-853381078645/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/1b/85/b4/1b85b4d0-7951-0188-6643-131e74ed1414/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/7a/cb/62/7acb62c2-6c6e-62cd-0e73-299fd36a9e21/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/de/ed/f6/deedf68c-5b0b-160c-c4e0-cd71a8c40266/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1d/95/17/1d9517ec-a6e2-312a-050c-6c94f69b5bbb/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Do svých mobilních telefonů si můžete připojit vaši občanku a využívat různé výhody oproti plastové kartičce.  Jedna aplikace obsahuje funkce jak pro občany a prokazování totožnosti, tak pro ověřovatele a ověřování totožnosti. 

Výhody pro občany
- Snadné prokazování totožnosti - spustíte aplikaci, předložíte QR kód ověřovateli, schválíte předání požadovaných údajů přes Bluetooth a za chvíli je hotovo.- 
- Jednoduché kopírování údajů do dalších aplikací - nemusíte hledat plastovou kartičku pokaždé, když je někde potřeba vyplnit její číslo. Mobil máte stále po ruce a s ním i občanku.
- Větší soukromí - poskytujete jen ty údaje, na které má ověřovatel nárok. Ne celou občanku. Můžete mít i přehled o tom, kdy a kdo vás ověřoval a jaké údaje jste mu předali. 

Výhody pro ověřovatele
- Vše v jedné aplikaci - nepotřebujete si instalovat ověřovací aplikaci, občan i ověřovatel používají stejnou.
- Snadné a rychlé ověření pravosti dokladu - občanku v eDokladech nelze zfalšovat.

I have to make new account page | I can’t even login in to any of my accounts | Pls | Insta is working up really badly, it’s not letting me send or refresh anything ono Please fix it | Poems from the collection of poems hiva,sorood, Zendeghi and aaaaay ferone man by Zina Esmaeili are shared. | My highlights option won’t pop up | pls stop showing me suggested reels that have absolutely nothing to do with anything i have ever viewed. i have 100+ of the same type of videos in my “not interested” yet i get the same ones no matter what. is the not interested button just there for fun? clearly it doesnt work. | Every single comment I make just simply talking. Gets taken down for “spam” my comments don’t shout anyone out, try to mislead people into clicking any links (I don’t have links anywhere in my comments or bio) they’re just simple comments of my reaction to thoughts about the post… this is not spam and my account is at the verge of being DELETED FOR SIMPLY ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY. this bot favors deleting my totally normal comments over actual racist comments. I’ve reported a comment of someone’s use of the hard r slur and it got rejected💀 I’ve reported people harassing others as well as doxing them on a favorably large account and THOSE rejected too…🙅 absolutely ridiculous… thinking about opening a law suit unless I get a brand new account that’s free verification checkmark to stop it from coming back to me | so recently ig had logged some people out of their accounts but some people were able to get back in but not for me, I can only get in my accs through the website and the ig app won’t allow me to login my account or any account | I’ve been using Instagram since around 2015. The app used to be fun to use. But over the years the quality has just gone down further and further. The moderating on their app is a JOKE. Fix your app Instagram. | Yall keep loggin me out my Instagram account like yall got me thinking Smb hacking me or sum | Instagram has logged me out 2 times in the past 30 min fix the bug | I receive an error everytime I try to add a template. It has not worked for months. I’ve tried every fix | I’ve opened 3 different accounts in the time I’ve had this app and for some reason every so often I won’t be able to access my account and then I can’t can’t reset my password or anything. I’ve given up trying | I could design a better app but it’s alright | Instagram is very viable to get hacked and I don’t like how they have no security or custom service | they need to fix where the make a channel dosent show up for some creators. | Got logged out February 12, 2024…Still can’t log back in. Can log in fine through the website and on another device only. | The notes that people send on instagram don’t appear for me on the top | I hate to give you guys a 2 star. I used to love instagram and enjoy being on it but now I just don’t know. I keep getting kicked out of my instagram account and it won’t let me back in for weeks or a month. “request error” or whatever. I’m seriously tired of it. I lost my patience cause this is just ridiculous! My music notes be disappearing and my followers be glitching saying I have 563 followers and then 662 like what? I don’t know what’s wrong with your app but I know I’m not the only one. Please fix your app. Thank you | Ive been logged out of my account for 3 days and it randomly happened. For no reason. everytime i try to log in it keeps saying error. Love this app but theres ethier a shut down on the app or errors going on. | Everytime my boyfriend video calls me on instagram it’s fine den it starts to act dumb and start logging him out of his account causing the video chat to hanging up. | I could go on all day talking about how much I love instagram! But my ONE complaint is that there is no pause button for the video you have to like hold down on the screen to pause it. Like what if I want to pause it and go do something and come back? I CANT DO THAT! And it is very upsetting especially for the fact that I can’t get TikTok and TikTok actually has a pause button. (I’m not trying to dis on you in anyway I would just like you to look into adding a pause button) | Back then i never had a problem with any of my accounts but now its been logging me out and i cant log in to more than one account, i try to log in and it doesnt let me. Its very frustrating | I’m bombarded with ridiculous brain rot posts on my explore page, which I cannot cater to how I like no matter how hard I try. I’ve pressed “not interested” or even “this post makes me uncomfortable” at least 50 times on borderline inappropriate body-checking posts that show up all over my feed, and they will NOT go away. 

After using TikTok and getting used to its far more advanced and personal algorithm, I just can’t stand instagram anymore. Do better | Overall I love Instagram I get to chat with my friends and stuff but sometimes it logs me out for no reason and I would like for you guys to fix this. I didn’t do anything wrong. I checked my reports and everything and I didn’t get banned or nobody reported me. Instagram is like a platform for me to talk with friends from out of state or make new friends, but this logging out thing is not gonna work for me to make friends. | i love instragram never had an issue with them! but as of recently the app keeps logging me out of my account and i’m getting quite worried it’s either a hacker or something. i’ve never clicked on any links..etc please fix this ! | My instagram reels never works ever | My acount was hacked my email and phone number where changed | Let me log into my account man | Me encanta compartír mis momentos ♥️ | I can’t like peoples notes 😾 | See this is where you go for a good laugh. The comments are funny a but also Instagram you are being a pee pee poo poo head. March 21st I got a suspension from commenting on videos until march 24th for going on hundreds of post and commenting “
Did you ever hear the tragedy of DarthPlagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not astory the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, sopowerful and so wise he could use the Forceto influence the midichlorians to create life...He had such a knowledge of the dark side thathe could even keep the ones he cared aboutfrom dying. The dark side of the Force is apathway to many abilities some consider to beunnatural. He became so powerful... the onlything he was afraid of was losing his power,which eventually, of course, he did.Unfortunately, he taught his apprenticeeverything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save othersfrom death, but not himself.” Well it’s 12:03am march 24th and I still can’t comment. | Listen as a casual user it’s fine aside from the constant adds and terrible algorithm, but with the amount of times it’s gone down and has system  bugs and issues more recently with thousands across the globe being logged out of their accounts including mine which I haven’t been able to access for days, the have no way to contact for help and their support section of their website is a useless and incredible unhelpful q&a, on top of that reporting through the app and sending help tickets never works as I’ve not once received a response or had my issues fixed and now I’m not even able to access my account and again no way to contact support and they don’t address these issues on any of their official accounts so there’s that. | The latest upgrade has my Instagram app not useable it says Page isn’t available right now. Contacted meta and Instagram with no response. | I sent many times that I have a problem on my account but no one answer me so this is main problem for me, but the another problem that I face that is I can’t switch my account status to public account | This app says it has guide lines and yet there’s videos of people being assaulted and killed in car accidents. People being harassed and hate speech left and right but Tik Tok is some how the issue? This app shouldn’t be in the hands of child at any age I’d say this is an 18+ app with all the horrible and inappropriate things people are ALLOWED to post because the “guidelines” don’t mean anything. | instagram has had many downs it’s currently not working won’t allow me to log into my main accounts | I'm not one to write reviews, but ever since the last update I am no longer able to partake in adding templates to my instagram story. I know its a little thing, but its one of those thing that instagram added that made it more fun and now it just gives me a headache. Is there any way to get this fixed? I've reported the technical issue so many times and never hear back. | Bruh I swear like literally every day they change something with the interface like one day I can't see the likes or comments then it's back then they change seeing the last viewed reel when clicking on someone's profile from the reels can you just like keep things consistent for like a day? It's just getting so confusing and now I look at profiles and everything is outlined in black?? Like what is up with that there is no need for all these changed | I had lost my instagram account I can’t log in it wants me to see if I’m not a robot I keep clicking next and doesn’t seem to be working I had that acc since I was young . | app literally breaks every month | Instagram removed most of my comments. Don’t even let me speak my mind on certain things, it’s crazy it really is & I hate instagram for it | Made me shot my family and kids | Sik’ wid’ it 🔊 | I can’t switch between accounts without having to restart my phone. 
I also have to type and search the persons name when sending a post or story instead of just tapping on the name in the area where the people you have the most frequently interaction with are pre selected. 
Please fix! | Instagram hasn't let me do live for 2 months now. I check if I have restrictions and nothing. The account is in perfect condition and it won't let me do live. The audio of the reels is heard superimposed and the application closes out of nowhere.

With our care plans, you will learn how to identify a plant, how often to water your trees, or why the leaf on your flower turned brown.

We have a wide variety of features that every green thumb would fall in love with: 

► Watering Calculator

This feature will help to figure out the right amount of water your green pet needs. You just need to answer several questions regarding your plant’s conditions, and voila! 

► Light Meter

Here is another helpful tool that calculates the correct lighting level for your greens! Just click the Light Meter button and point the camera at the plant. Our AR-based technology will automatically scan the nearest environment, measure the amount of light, and tell if you need to move the plant to a brighter or shadier spot. 

► Care Plans

Plantkeeping will become even more effortless with our Personalized Care Plans. Request a plan for almost any species, from common houseplants to exotic cultivars. Your Snake plant care needs some improvements, or maybe you just got your first air plant and are not sure what to do with it? Get thorough watering, fertilization, lighting, and even pruning instructions easily and make ‘em grow!

► Care Notifications

Our users say that our plant care app helps with organizing daily routines! Keep calm – we will send your reminders to make sure that all your green pets are following their watering and fertilization schedules. Moreover, there are special weather notifications so that you will be warned in case of storms, freezing temperatures, and other unfavorable conditions that may harm your outdoor oasis.
 
► Ask the Botanist

Use this feature to get a consultation with our experienced gardening experts. Ask any questions regarding houseplant care and get custom recommendations, step-by-step guides, useful hints, and detailed instructions for your particular case.

Last but not least, we are happy to present our latest update: 

► Mushroom Identification

Our fresh mushroom identifier will become a fav feature for every single shroom hunter! While designed to identify fungi online in several taps, we have implemented a technology for offline id: no more hesitation while outdoors in lush woods. Identify edible mushrooms for delicious dinners, learn new fungi species, and use our feature to detect poisonous specimens.

PlantIn was created to provide loving care for each of your green pets, so let’s make this world greener and educate ourselves on botany together! Stay plantuned for more lifesaving info from our plant care app.

This app has been such a big help to me as I learn the needs of each and every plant I have! | This app offered a “Lifetime Subscription” for $49.99, which I purchased. I noticed 2 weeks later that they charged me the 49.99 and were ALSO charging me the 6.99 a week fee. There was no option to cancel it either, so I had to just delete the entire thing, which cancelled my lifetime subscription as well. Comes off like a scam—buyer beware. | Awesome informative information can help keep
Me from over watering my plants | I do not have a green thumb but I love plants however I always end up killing them so I never replaced the plants I had. Finally I gave it another go and downloaded this app and once again things went south but this time the app helped me save and take care of my plants and now I have a growing collection 🥰 | This app doesn't work. Can’t identify anything. When did identify some plant was wrong. Don’t get this. | I only got to scan one plant and you ask for debit card number. It didn’t even tell me much and you want $. Maybe you can get someone else to pay for that little bit of info but not me. Hope you do better. | I’m going to delete this app 
It tells you that it’s free But
When you down load it it’s only free for 3 days!!  Not telling it’s only on trial basis. 
After which it is $7.99 a week
Not telling anyone upfront about fees!! | This app locked me in without any way to cancel thru the App or the Apple subscriptions on my phone, and illegally charged me despite cancelling within the three days. It provided no “cancel subscription” option.

The App initially had a “cancel subscription” option, which I pushed. But then it disappeared, didn’t cancel and then showed my subscription as “active” when I had actually cancelled it.

The app must be improved to not illegally lock a customer in, illegally charging and then having no way to fix the problem on the app or on your phone under subscriptions.

The app was useless too and it only provided the same standard info about overwatering or underwatering the plant for each plant I scanned. Provided no useful information and that’s why I cancelled during the 3-day trial period. This app is trash | This year me and family have decided that start and fruit and vegetables garden, there are so many right and wrong this you can do. This app has helped so much with identifying plants we forgot to label and helping keep track of when we last watered. Gibes great tips on how to keep your plants healthy, you can even reach out for expert help. Lots of great features ! | Love it | This is not as instant as I thought, but definitely within the same day response. | But so far so good! This app is helping me keep track of all my plant babies and how to care for them! | I just bought the lifetime subscription. It has misidentified a lemon tree as a bitter orange tree, a tangerine tree as a bitter orange tree, a blackberry plant as a raspberry plant, a blueberry plant as a raspberry plant. It did get the pineapple plant right. But I don't want to pay for something that works less than 50% of the time. | So far Iva had 0 problems with this app, I keep my plants healthy | First, the app doesn’t diagnose when scanning a plant like the advertisement. I expected specific recommendations for individual plants. It only gives the same soil additions for every plant. Second, the app couldn’t recognize the common and popular houseplant, African violet.
I paid for a lifetime subscription so I hope the app gets better. My mistake for not trying the trial first. Now I know why there is no free trial period. | First and foremost the company took $67 of my dollars that they will not give back because when I switched my plan over from weekly to lifetime they simply kept charging me. Then they charge for themes, to get info from a botanist… I have never been able to get a diagnosis of a sick plant. It does recognize plants but Google lens does that free. | I love this app provides a bunch of helpful tips for keeping my garden growing ! | I filed a refund request less than a day after getting this app. I tried out the app and it just doesn’t work like I need it to. It misidentified Brussels sprouts for kale, for example, and yes I know that’s in the same family but I need precision, not guessing. Apple won’t give me my money back even after an appeal? That’s crazy! This app is not worth FIFTY DOLLARS! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! | Plantin is a great way to not only identify plants but also figure out the best care for your house plants | Love how informative this app is ! | I tried taking a picture of my pink Princess but it kept showing up as a red philodendron. Which isn’t a big deal really, I just would like to know about the differences and have more pictures to look at on the app. | I do NOT have a green thumb, but this is a great app to tech u HOW to have a pretty green thumb!! Point ur camera,  take a picture of any plant or flower, and I’ll be dang if the directions on what I was doing wrong, and how to make it better,  (my plants)  IT FLIPPIN WORKED!!  And it’s still working! 
Thanks PLANTIN, u guys are amazing!!!
My plants owe you their lives!!!  Haha!! | You do not have Magnolia Inspiration on your list. What a shame. | PLEASE BEWARE!!!!   This is a really shady app!  They mislead you to think that you have unsubscribed to the service just to continually charge you $8.99 EVERY WEEK!   There is no way to cancel your subscription in the app and when you contact them, they will only try to upsell you, not tell you how to cancel, and ghost you.  

Here is what you must do to cancel before your free trial ends. 

Open the Settings app.
Tap your name.
Tap the subscription you want to manage
Tap Cancel Subscription | IT WORKS!!! My plant, which had been struggling for a while, was finally diagnosed with severe depression. Now, we give it therapy once a week. I can't wait to see the positive changes that will come about as a result!🤧🌿🌿🌿🌿😵‍💫🤤😵‍💫🤤

😵 | Would never buy it. The app simply not doing what it is supposed to do. | Cancelling the free trial as the app couldn’t identify any of my plants. | This app is fantastic easy to use and very helpful to keep track of your plants and watering schedule plus all the extras I would highly recommend for indoor plants and outdoor ones as well | Helped identify a struggling plant I have that was a gift with no description of the plant. | Love looking at new plants with my kids we learn so much | I took pics of three different plants and it couldn’t identify one. | It has helped me figure out so many different types of plants and flowers and it is so easy to use. Highly recommend | Tree and plants aren’t accurate just yet. Need to keep building the database | Cancelled the free trial. The app does not correctly identify my plants therefore can't figure our whats wrong with it. | Doesn’t identify | After leaving to try other similar apps I’m back. I love the interface and design quality. It’s a fun app to use! | Took two Pictures of same plant at different angles. Given two different names. A waste of time.

Cancel this ASAP | Great app!!! | Tried the top 6 in education under app and this one was the most cost effective and user friendly by far! | Just wish it was free and easier to see where did I need improvement in my gardening | This site is fantastic!  I use it constantly to keep my plants alive and well.  It’s easy to use and gives amazing advice.  Will keep this in my phone forever! | But for 6.99 a week it’s a rip off most of the stuff you can find here can be found on you tube if you know who to watch… and identified with bing image search. The price is not worth the value but hey that’s just my opinion | Does not recognize the simplest plant. Scanning my healthy plant as sick and wrong plant. | I canceled the free trial within 24hrs and have just realized I was continually being charged. | This app is a scam.  I opted for the free trial and then the lifetime purchase.  It changed me immediately and did not allow me to cancel during the trial.   It did not identify the issue with my plants in detail.  Run!  Do not download this app unless you intend to pay without a trial.  I’m so disappointed in the quality of the app as well as not being allowed the 3 day trial period.  I tried to cancel within 60 minutes of signing up for the trial. | Free online plant website figured out the problem with my lemon tree
This app did nothing because the tree needed a humidifier and it had no idea
I can’t believe they want money for almost killing my tree
Not reliable if you’re first attempting anything valuable | I am really loving this app. It is so informative and exciting. I am a plant enthusiast. | Works better than I thought it would. Identified a baby tree I started caring for thinking it was a pretty weed and never knew what it was. | It’s that time of the year. I’ve always wanted to have plants but I don’t know much about their care. I’m hoping with this app I will have beautiful plants all year round! | I’ve taken the photo of my plant a few times but each time it yielded the same results.

If I’m refreshing and taking the photo of the same plant, the app should give suggestions as to how to re take the photo so it yields different results.

Inappropriate words but out of all is a very good editing tool 😃 | I love CapCut, being creative with my photos and sharing them with the world. Explore and be creative with all of your content!!! Worldwide . | The app is amazing yet i think with all the effects that are pro they could share with the people who have not paid for that package. Pro I understand is supposed to have better effects ( that’s what you pay for) but some could be spared to be able to use in the ordinary. Over all i would definitely recommend this to a friend as it goes well over my expectations. It will take some time to know how to use but once you do, amazing it is. | I love the app and I feel you can express your feelings and just have fun with it and I just think it is a really fun and creative app | Editing is easier to learn on here and has opened up many different avenues for me. Absolutely love CC (Pro is definitely worth it, I swear the time I save having auto cut and so many effects that with the right teacher or YouTube videos, you could even compete with Premire/ AE. Obviously that’s a whole other ballpark but I won 3rd in a editing competition with a couple guys using AE! Sooo it’s definitely worth it 😆 good luck. Also CapCut sponsor my pro membership. I already live here :,) | I love this app! If gives us many effects to use that image are awesome and free! I would rate it 5 stars but there is a little issue. It takes a long time to load if you wanna use a template or your adding a video to edit it. But over all I love this app! I’m on it everyday making edits or watching templates! | This is amazing app!!! | Im pretty much a novice and CapCut is awsome | To learn it is to use it…To know it is to love it! You’ll see what I mean… | For my whole 3 years of editing I’ve been using KineMaster, don’t get me wrong, KineMaster is great in all… But when I discovered CapCut
I realized it’s so much better! All my friends had it so I thought “it can’t be that great” but oh man! I was wrong this deserves best app ever! I am addicted to it! | Hey parents I know ur reading this cause that’s what all parents do.
So just a heads up this game is almost identical to tik tok but much safer, and has a tone of templets for your kid to choose from. And there is a restriction so if your kid is under 14 years old they can not creat an account but can still use the app. So that means no posting no commenting on other templets and no money for it. But if you want your kid or they want to get money out of making templets you have to be over 18 to make your own templets to get money out of. So as you can see it is a very safe app and is a great way to keep your kids out of your hair. And we all know you need that. 😂😂❤️❤️ | 5/5 I LOVE IT! | Very easy to use it | It’s very useful and it works well. it’s the best social media app because not just the variety of people and opinions. It’s the fact that we have a smaller community than TikTok and a nicer community | I love they have such good templates and very good quality 👍 | Love it, makes my Photos and Videos better. | Super easy to use! Wish they had more auto cut videos but other than that they’re great. | I used this app since 2020 but everything is pro now. But i do love the app | Is the best edit editing app ever because it made me get a lot more followers on TikTok and subscribers on YouTube but my YouTube channel got deleted so | Obsssseeeessssed!  Great things are coming to my digital marketing biz.  Amazing | يجنن البرنامج بس عندي تعليق واحد ياريت يضيفون خطوط عربية اكثر رح يصير تطبيق بطل لو اضافو ويصير 5 نجوم

I wish you add extra Arabic fonts then this app in my opinion will be the best app | This app is AMAZING, I like this app and have been using it for years. It’s just there’s something I don’t like now. When your putting in the texts and then delete a part of a video it would delete the text with it as if the video cut and the text are merged together and this has never happened. I’m not sure if it’s some kind of glitch or CapCut did this, I just really don’t like it. I had to delete all the texts. | To be honest CapCut used to be free but you have to pay to access other effects that used to be free which I hate because I don’t want to be paying 99.99 yearly just to edit? Seriously please go back to the stuff where it used to be all free | So I’ve been using capcut for a while now, about a year… and I’ve enjoyed using it, yes. But the only problem I have with capcut is how LAGGY it can get. I can’t stand the basically 3-5 second delay everytime I press a button, it’s so annoying. And this only implies for bigger projects, and I want that fixed, if possible. The updates aren’t helping, clearing my cache isn’t either, and deleting projects doesn’t either. I want this fixed someway somehow. PLEASE, Capcut. | CAPCUT PLS TURN OFF THE “YOU MAY LIKE”
I know u just changed it-but I just don’t like it because it’s says unappropriate THINGS | CapCut helps me a lot I highly recommend!! | Good for edits would recommend | Easy to follow along with the templates. | I love CapCut so mutchbi have been using it for years and it is great for making edits for social media or even adds | I love CapCut cause you can edit and it comes. Out so good | Okay so I do absolutely love capcut it’s perfect for making gacha videos (I’m a gachatuber) but a lot of the things wont work for me like the auto captions say to try again later but it never works also the thing where you type in something and get some templates that have that yeah when I click on that it just shows white and I have to restart the app this happens a lot with other things also which is pretty annoying also I’ve tried reinstalling and it still doesn’t work 😐
But it’s still a good app! | Excelente aplicación de edicion de video | unlike kinemaster where you have to go through so much trouble to get music. they have a whole copyright free database with capcut. minimal effort required | Like if you’re a beginner you could basically use this for your videos. This is the best app good for. | Well idk software, but really the stuff is nice, the transitions, animations, effects, everything! | This has got to be my favorite editing app, it has all the basic features for a beginner or pro like me, but it has some minor glitches that are annoying. For example, when I import a photo, it says “no media” when I have photos and the key frames are kinda broken because the image isn’t moving so I have to reload the app. Overall it’s a good alternative | This is so fun I just learned how to post edits and I’m having a blast | I’m obsessed with this app. It’s so fun. It’s like social media, but not fully. It makes the kids happy, but doesn’t worry the parents. There is no drama, and real safe. | It’s so good and I use it for editing and I love how you can export sounds! | I like it and it is good | I use this app almost everyday to make edits for my friends and for my YouTube channel AMAZINg no complaints | Now every game must have an add but not after every templet you use???!!! I just exported something and boom and add I thought nothing of it and said it’s just an add but to my surprise the best 5 exports all have adds and this has never happened before???!!! But besides the adds the app is great I get to use templets and even make my own edit -Eliza | CapCut it is amazing I love to edit and watch them it is so fun CapCut is such a fun app and if you don’t have it your should get it it is and fun app if you are in the editing hope you love it | This was such a great app!!!!!!! | I love this app I just wish it would accept my creator request | Great App! Easily editing photos as a beginner | I don't know if I'm actually uploaded videos but I hope I am but still very good app | was good till you had to start paying to use the filters | It’s the BEST editing out I’ve tried so many and buy so many I mean so many definitely the best it has so many things and pro offers 1000 more things but yeah definitely get it.

Pro použití v datových schránkách si do mobilního telefonu nebo tabletu nainstalujte aplikaci Mobilní klíč a v Datových schránkách ji připojte ke svému uživatelskému účtu (Nastavení - Možnosti přihlášení - Přihlášení Mobilním klíčem). Pro přihlášení do Datových schránek pak stačí se přihlásit do Mobilního klíče otiskem prstu (nebo PINem, heslem či obrázkovým heslem - podle vlastní volby) a sejmout QR kód na přihlašovací stránce.

Jeden Mobilní klíč si můžete připojit k více datovým schránkám. Po přihlášení Mobilním klíčem vám pak Datové schránky nabídnou výběr ze všech dostupných uživatelských účtů.

Do Mobilního klíče mohou být také doručována upozornění na nové zprávy ve vaší datové schránce.

Pro přihlašování přes Národní bod se nabízí více možností. Poté co si aplikaci nainstalujete na mobilní telefon, můžete si buď do Národního bodu přenést svou identitu z datové schránky nebo si spárovat aplikaci Mobilní klíč se svým stávajícím účtem v Národním bodě za použití jiného elektronického prostředku pro přihlášení nebo si můžete na kontaktním místě veřejné správy (Czech POINT) založit nový účet v Národním bodě.

Mobilní klíč vyžaduje ke svému běhu iOS verze 11 či vyšší a zapnutý zámek obrazovky (nesmí být možné odemknout zařízení prostým odsunutím obrazovky, musí být nastaven odemykací obrazec, PIN nebo heslo).

Pokud má vaše zařízení Touch ID nebo Face ID a iOS alespoň 11, je možné se do Mobilního klíče přihlásit otiskem prstu (Touch ID) nebo načtením obličeje (Face ID).

Pro přihlášení do Datových schránek je potřeba, aby měl telefon či tablet přístup na internet - je jedno, zda přes mobilní data nebo pomocí Wi-Fi.

Aplikace Mobilní klíč zajišťuje pouze bezpečné přihlášení bez nutnosti zadávat přihlašovací údaje. Samotný přístup do datové schránky (čtení zpráv) probíhá i nadále ve webovém prohlížeči - aplikace nic jiného než přihlášení (a doručení notifikací) nezajišťuje.

Does Facebook care?! | I hate how you have to be over 18 to sell stuff,as a highschool kid trying to raise money in ffa it would be a lot easier on my life to have it to where a 15 yr old can have it. | Banned from market place for no reason they can show me, won’t answer emails as to why and seem to “fact-check” 99% incorrectly when a post doesn’t align with their agenda. | Been asking for sale thing formonth. None of them do anything!! | Tired of all the ads.  They outnumber my contacts and are mostly irrelevant to me | Can’t get enough of it frfr | Facebook use to be amazing. It’s helped me connect, reconnect, and stay in touch with friends and family. But now I go on and the first post is a suggested group for something related to a group I’m already a part of. Then another suggest group/ page then an ad. I scrolled through 12 ads and suggested groups pages before seeing a friends post from 2 weeks ago.  Why would Facebook suggest I join a group when it won’t even start by showing me posts from a group I’m actually in?  The algorithm is terrible. #FixFacebook | I was using Facebook one day and my marketplace icon disappeared out of no where and now it says I cannot access it when it’s typed in on the search. This is a known issue and it needs to be resolved NOW. I never post anything and have only sold a few things on marketplace before. Yes marketplace is available in my country, and I would hope so because it’s the United States. 2 stars because everything else works fine | Me encanta | Awesome app. I truly enjoy it.

I am disabled and was unable to walk across a busy road full of buses and moving cars to meet this driver, as it was unsafe and would have started the money costing wait timer. So I tried to wave the driver down with my hands but they did not notice me. I canceled my ride as I was unable to take it, and took the same exact ride a few moments later with a driver that went to the correct pick up location. I contacted support 2 times and they keep saying the driver was at the correct pickup location and would not be refunding me, I am disputing this transaction with my bank. | I attempted to register with my U.S. phone number but I couldn’t receive a text or call back to register. 

Please advise. | SMS verification didn’t send to my phone number. I checked several times to make sure I entered it correctly. I’m not sure who Bolt was texting for SMS verification, but it sure wasn’t me. | SMS verification does not work!!! Can’t login | მადკობა დიდი | Do not download this app if you’re a foreigner from another country. The first time I tried this app, I was scammed out of my money by a driver I booked by card who told me half way through the trip that I had to pay with cash. I was stuck in this man car, in a foreign country, on the highway, at this person mercy. When I tried to contact the company about this, they had no call number and I was stuck in chat for 30 minutes waiting for assistance. Are you serious? I’m in an emergency and I’m on hold for 30 minutes in a chat? When I reported my problem, I was told to tell the driver that it’s against policy. Do I work for you? You tell the driver, I’m stuck in his car. When I told the company of this app that he’s forcing me to pay with cash, they required me to upload a video to show proof that I was being forced to pay with cash. Unable to upload the video in their chat do to them limiting the size of an attachment, I sent pictures of me physically handing this man cash with his license plate number to prove it’s him. They told me that it wasn’t good enough, and that I had to put the video on google drive and send them the link…. Yes, you heard right. Get video evidence of a man scamming me like he will play along? Wow! Do not do it, it’s not worth downloading. I don’t care what the reviews say. If a driver of this company knows they can get away with this, it will never be fixed. Your safety is important when in a vehicle of another person, and this company has mediocre safety precautions to protect you. | When I downloaded the app, I repeatedly requested a verification number by text. After five attempts and no text, I deleted the app. | My family of 14 used this service during our vacation in Thailand.

Very reliable, convenient, safe and AFFORDABLE! | I have never seen such a thing after years of using ride-shares I booked a rideshare from CDG airport to Paris because there was a 20 % off promotion bringing the price down from E 50 to E 40 . The Driver took a very different route from the one shown on on the App veering west in a 1/2 circle . Upon arrival and drop off the price suddenly doubles to E 100 + , I am charged a late fee pick up ( I wasn’t late ) After 10 hours of arguing back and forth on text with “ support “ within the App they accused me to have “ changed destination “ which I never did ; since this is my home address Finally after 9 hours of arguing on texts they recognized that the driver was the one who changed the destination and offer to give me a BOLT credit ( no refund ) while keeping the tip and “late fees “ . no disciplinary action on Mafia type driver , no excuses etc I will never use BOLT again after I use up my credit I kept all the screenshots and will escalate this Here is the final Bolt text they sent me before they hung up March 11, 2024 at 8:54 PM Thank you for your feedback. I apologize for the confusion, it turns out after thorough investigations that it was the driver who changed the destination of the ride. In order to remedy this situation, I would like to offer you a refund of your €51.5 on your Bolt balance, as this is a partial refund and the system does not allow us to refund you on your original means of payment. For your information, this refund is available on your balance with no expiry date, and you can use it at any time for your next ride. Please confirm your agreement so that we can generate the refund on your account. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and reaffirm the availability of support to assist you in resolving any type of inconsistent situation. Have a great day! Glory, Bolt. | I have been trying to get a hold of customer service on this app for days and there has been no response. This was an urgent request and I still have yet to receive any response. I’ve emailed, replied multiple times in the app, and searched far and wide for a number to call to get the situation resolved as soon as possible. Terrible and will be going back to Uber instead. | The developers need more testing on the initial installation 

After launching the app for the first time it was suppose to send a code to the phone, tried it many times but it did not work | Whenever I wan to use the app e no open | App is convenience to use. | Great service at the best price. Staff very professional | Do not receive code when installing in the US tried email logging as well | Phone number verify to set up account does not work.  Could not complete set up | Heading to Budapest. No uber or lyft so i tried to download app and create account. Can’t get past text verification since it will not text or call with a code. Moving on to City taxi. | Nice and cool trip | Bolt has presence in many European countries. The customer service team is also very professional and responsive. As a traveler, Bolt makes it easy to travel around Europe, just with the app. | ممتاز جدا جدا
بس اتمناء توفير سيارات الفان الكبيرة للعائلات | I am traveling to Hungary and am trying to install this app. But I am unable to verify with a code. The app claims to have sent me a code, but nothing comes through after multiple tries. Not sure if there is a problem sending a sms text to a US number. Have to find an alternate now. | I ordered a bolt and my app shows 62 baht, after reaching my destination, she charged me 72 Baht!!! I ask her why? She don’t know and don’t speak English!! | They’re very rude and patronizing when they talk to you about technical issues | Affordable & Reasonable | Good | انصح بتحميل البرنامج وستخدامه يحفظ حقك وحق سائق | Very nice | almost had an issue with my driver today cause there was a price surge out of the limit specified on the app, which is way out of my budget | Wanted to try but couldn’t | This not using bolt app price | عند طلب الرحلة يخصم المبلغ ثم يظهر عدم وجود سائق وعندما تطالب باسترداد المبلغ يتهربون باعذار غير مقبوله او عدم الرد والله على ما اقول شهيد | You ain’t gon see again as a customer. T for thanks | Easy, efficient, pleasant service. | Thai app abuses its push notification privileges by sending spam unrelated to rides and random
Times. | Love it | Never really write App Reviews but I’ve never felt more frustrated with an app. Used Bolt for my trip in Thailand and had to deal with a lot of scammers. The worst part is, whenever you try to submit a support ticket, they never get back to you. There are continuing to let these scammers on the app! | One of the best bolt drivers I have come across. Very kind and understanding. | After my frustration on yesterday, customer support finally get back to me and rather than a partial refund, they applied a full refund to me. I was only expecting partial refund not a full refund. That’s why I kind of take it back what I told to them. Thanks for the help!

————————————————————
I was charged £51 for a £34.5 trip with all fees included. There was no heavy traffic, we even arrived earlier. I contacted support, and it automatically offer refund to my bolt account and I said no, because I want refund to my original method of payment. Then I got assigned someone to and told me to chose refund in two ways. I said want a refund to my account. And it almost 1.5 hr, I’m still waiting the response. Worst customer support so far!! | Guy didn’t show up where map said. Charged me for his mistake👎😳😢🤬 | I began using Bolt for the first time one week ago and I am here to stay. Better drivers and fastest service. THANK YOU BOLT! | Always quick to arrive. Cheaper than grab! Great so far | Very easy to use and very similar to Uber. Only downside is sometimes you are charged up front and some times after the fare. The fare quoted when ordering a taxi is an estimate. I have noticed the drivers usually charge less so not sure if that is reflecting on the pre-charges. 
Overall good app though and would recommend. | It requires a sms confirmation message that never arrives to US cell phone, frustrating experience if you’re traveling to a large city like Milan, use LIME that works with Uber. This is a bad option if you’re not an European resident | App says driver is available in 3 minutes.  After placing the order, driver after driver accepts and then cancels.  I use another app since I’m in a hurry and cancel.  The app charges me an enormous cancellation fee.  When I dispute, they say they will refund, but the never do.  When I notice it was never refunded they now say it is too late!  What a scam! | In Lisbon and Oeiras, PT 
Drivers didn’t answer the phone or message requesting details on where to find them. One driver dumped me across a 4-lane highway from the location I requested.  It was quite dangerous crossing… | I downloaded and tried to create an account by various means but all require an OTP or a callback to my phone. Despite trying every method about 50 times, the have received no OTP and no call back either | I had scheduled 11am to go pattaya this morning.
Driver come late and cancel my ride after 11:15am
With no reasons. I need to find another driver immediately but the price much more expansive than before. After that another new driver found he cancel our ride because he want us to pay cash. I have a terrible ride experience today. | The divers are fine and app works well but the app doesn’t use Google maps so often times it has me paying way more because the route is inefficient but the drivers use Google maps to find the better directions. I would give 5 stars if they used google maps. | I try to use this app in Lisbon. After confirmation every second price changed. As soon as I confined latest price it change again and again. More than 10 times. I give up. Instead I used Uber there and I was very happy.

SHOP TEMU, ALOT CHEAPER and they don’t add anything extra! | They have started to cheat the customers showing different prices. While selecting the items shows one low price and while checking out shows othe prices. I will be the one stop buying from this site. It’s not transparent. | I love shein for their good clothing and stuff but those games are so trash why keep lying making us keep having to send out invites I don’t know all these people if we have to go through a million loops then just say that ! Not happy | The first order was not good at all, the quality was horrible and the shirt ripped right away, I ordered a second time and never even got the package. It said it was delivered but never was, and they are making it so hard to refund. | this company is in a city in china, and pays under minimum wage, and i can't stand for it! your clothing is made cheap, and you barely take accountability when you are being literally cancelled. show some responsibility for your company and life. your ceo is a psycho. and every time someone makes a bad review, the developer pastes the same thing on to every message!!! it's insane, your developers can't take 2 minutes writing a personal message for the review. overall, horrible company. i will NOT be shopping with you again. 1 star. | Order something got lost in mail never came! | My package was stolen because the delivery driver left it on the floor downstairs I contacted shein about it and they won’t do anything no refund or deliver my package again. I won’t be shopping here again as this is just ridiculous. | Bro shein is the BEST thing like if u want sum thing likeAccessories clothes cute sandals shoes handbags plus more you could go right to shein | It’s not as fun now that you have to buy $30 worth just to check out with free shipping, it used to be Sundays free shipping no matter how much. Unfortunately, I’ll be deleting the app after my order comes in. It was nice while it lasted. | Once the order is placed they have no option in changing the address if you want to change it and after shipping they can’t help you.also the company that delivers is not useful in changing the address and all you can do is wait for the package to be delivered to a wrong address. | shein is a scam i get one price and my friend in another country gets a low price compared to mine bye bye shein welcome amazon also they charge tax and very high | Why can’t y’all sell cotton tee shirts? Every single article of women’s tee shirts are made with zero cotton. Not everyone likes that material. Other than that I give where props are they are due. I’m only complaining about the tee shirts and I still order frequently. | La calidad es muy buena los precios igual 
Pero lo malo es que uno no puede contactarse cuando no llega el pague 
 No tiene la manera de contactarse solo lo pierdes y ya | I used to love shopping with shein, but the customer service is terrible, 99% of their things are very poorly made, their policy’s are unclear ESPECIALLY with shein club (not worth the headache, they won’t believe you or give you the services you paid for even after showing proof). I’d rather pay the extra buck and get the things I want / need somewhere else. | This is not a very pleasing app to order on, I ask for a refund & didn’t get my money back. Also one of my packages came open & damaged & not to mention it came super late!!! When I literally paid for a fast shipping. Never again! Delete this app y'all! Save y’all’s money. | Everytime that I go to check in so I can build up my points on the app it always send me backwards. Just yesterday I was on the 3rd day in a row and now today when I went to check in again it went back to the 2nd one. They’re clothes, jewelry and everything else are a lot better quality than Temu for sure. | 100 percent get it! So cheap and so cute ❤️ | The taxes are insane it’ll be a necklace for a dollar and I’ll end up paying 5 dollars | I hate SHEIN because every time I order something my package never comes and it comes what it doesn’t come at all I waited till the 22nd which is today and I didn’t get my package and I was supposed to get my package on the 21st or the 20th and I still haven’t got it and now I’m giving y’all a bad review I should’ve gave y’all no star but I don’t know if I can do that to get my package before it be a real problem | The prices may be amazing but most of yall don’t know that they use forced labor on uyghur Muslim, putting them into concentration camp and force laboring for SHEIN. Recently SHEIN was selling Muslim prayer mats as “Greek carpet” how disgusting and disrespectful, shame on you SHEIN and the ceo #racist #forcedlabour #stopthegenocide | They are the worst place to order clothes from they sent all my packages to the wrong place when not give me my refund. No reason my packages do not order from SEE at worst service ever. | The app is cool overall but it makes it difficult to track your package. It has slow updates and frequent incorrect rough estimates dates on when I’ll receive my package. | Hate this shopping app and the stupid games. | 𝙸 𝚕𝚒𝚔𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚊𝚙𝚙, 𝙸'𝚟𝚎 𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚐𝚑𝚝 𝚊 𝚏𝚎𝚠 𝚒𝚝𝚎𝚖𝚜.

I tried multiple times and found out they charged my card multiple times 😡 so I cancelled all the orders. Hopefully they will refund my money back. I placed an order a couple weeks ago and received it but the size guide a little off. Will not be ordering from Shein again. 😒 | This app will not display in landscape format.  Please fix this! | When u order stuff it looks like how it needs to as far as playing the games to earn stuff it’s doesn’t work !!! | my friends signed up and i didn’t get the energy to spin. | Tienen mucha variedad y de muy buena calidad súper recomendada | They canceled my order a did not refund me my money | They are very untrue and they take long on every thing it does not make no sense of to why they play with your refund and your packages and delivery I was highly upset of that do better shein. | Charging someone for express shipping & taking over two weeks to send their items is ridiculous. Can’t even get in touch with anyone to cancel my order ! | If the quality was better and the return policy wasn’t 7.99 for each return after first one. I love the looks but everything I’ve gotten I didn’t like because of the quality. And some things don’t look like the picture. | Things are so pretty and beautiful here!It feels like i’m having the best time ever! | It is probably the best app I have on my phone right now.It do not scam you at all it will be not long for your packages to be there. If you are a girl or boy or you need home and game stuff you should get it now. If I was you I would get it right away!!😁😁😁😁😁 | Bad quality | bought the some of the hottest clothes i've ever seen for my lover but shein's clothes are made using harmful dyes and chemicals that give people dermatitis and even worse skin diseases. 
and their customer service is useless. they sent the wrong item on three separate orders but refused to do anything about it! and don't even think about getting your moneyback! shein never give refunds.
i know the clothes are cheap and sexy but it's not worth it people! | The mini games they have are a scam do not play them. I played the puppy love mini game to get a free gift and the first go around I wasnt close to getting it because you have to make orders. So second time around I did 3-4 orders and did my daily log ins to collect and feed my dog. I needed .1% left out of 100% with 7 days left which I could finish it in 2 and they completely took the game off of my screen. So I deleted the app thinking it was lagging and redownloaded it and before I signed back in it reappeared. When I signed in it took it away. It refuses to give people anything! | I love this app so much it’s literally the best.very cheap clothes and as long as you look at reviews before buying you should be good with the clothes. I just love this app definitely get it. | they are liers and thieves i will never trust a soul when it comes down to shein again they made my life miserable i sat up on my bed with a big smile thinking it was gone be some free stuff and they tricked me im not the one to be played with shein imma tell you that now you messed with the wrong one whos your boss ? | Y’all gave me a shocking pen instead of what I ordered and yes I’m giving y’all a bad review because y’all really played with my money and I don’t play about my money | I love SHEIN it’s so good I get ALL my phone cases from here super cheep but keep my phone safe! I don’t ever weight review so yk it’s good! The ONLY reason it gets a 4 instead of a 5 is bc of the deal where you do service and you get “$750” is not true I have tried several times and after it says I have to do 20 more or it just don’t work but it’s great other then that! | Muy lindas las cosas en la app pero últimamente tienen muy mal servicio se equivocan de dirección o devuelven el paquete a las instalaciones y te envían una notificación de que no se encontró tu dirección y te reembolsan el dinero para no llevarte tu paquete 0/10 | i order some jeans and it took it out of my cart even though i already paid for them smh🙄 | Worst app in history don’t order stuff thru here | So the shien games is basically about inviting people but when you start it’s aside you’re suspicious and now it stops you from inviting people I was on my last person invite them and then for some reason it wouldn’t let me SHIEN YOU BETTER GIVE ME MY REWARD 

my code was Can you accept my invite, and help me get my gift?
Just download the SHEIN app, and search for my code there!

Okay maybe it lags a bit, BUT STILL great app. Def recommend u too get it rn🤍! | Ggg | all i want to do is tag my unreleased juice wrld hut spotify will vault songs at its own free will. can i have “passport” back please?? where did it go? i don’t want to re-sync it. it shouldn’t have been gone in the first place. | I like Spotify cuz it’s simple to use and sure there is ads but I get the premium version it’s a good app for people who want to listen to music | I love Spotify I use it all the time The only thing is you have to have 
Premium for certain things and it doesn’t have the like songs in a playlist anymore you just have to play it and not choose the song so now I have to search the song but other then that I love Spotify definitely recommend | It takes cares of bugs, oolaws music to be played outside of running apps. Much good, sumtime ad hammer butt otherwise goud. | It is so chill thx so very w | I would say that there should by a custom way of showing the lyrics (in which every person can customize the lyrics) as I find other patters like the apple music is more WOW to look at (not saying that Spotify is bad in that area but you get the idea)
Also there should be a karaoke mode | They keep adding random songs into my playlists and shuffle is turned on and I can't turn it of it kind of annoyed me can you please fix it? | Its the best app for music and it will give you more songs based off of the songs you playy | This is an amazing app to learn and enjoy life | This is one of my most used apps ever, I love how you can make your own albums and publish them to the public. But I really want there to be a feature where I can be able to look at my password when I go into my settings. I recently got a new phone so I went into my iPad to find my password but I couldn’t find it and I don’t have it saved in my passwords so please let us see it. | Spotify keeps giving me thousands of ads every time I click on one song I got six ads today when I was trying to put on AC/DC | it's good but commercial kill this app | you removed my followings, give me my followings back followings change my music taste i changed my music taste give me back my followings and my playlists, give me back my followings update the app for my followings please 😞 | I love Spotify it’s a 10/10 recommendation to listen to your favorite podcasts songs and anything that you want to listen it has like every single song you like there’s nothing bad about it! | My premium free trial ran out, and omg I hate this app now. I have Spotify free, and now I can’t skip songs, am constantly getting ads, get songs in my playlist that I didn’t even add, have poor audio quality, and can’t even choose the song I wish to listen to. 4.5 stars before, 2 max now. | Help me become one with my center and showing that side of me for the world to see. Music is directional eh | It helps in taking your personal Time Machine and enjoy your own classics. | Jsi | So I downloaded a few weeks ago (I know it’s a little late) but anyway, I loved the app but I went into it today and say that it’s completely different and harder to use and a bit inconvenient when trying to listen to a certain song. | The songs are great I have learned so many different songs from this app. | Hate YouTube music and amzon prime and apple yours is great | It is really good and smooth but I just don’t want to pay for not to have the ads | There is way too many ads step up your game | I have tried using the app for about two weeks but found it impossible. The main issue that I found was that the app wouldn’t play the songs that I pressed on and instead, played random songs. Wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone. | I love this app | Don’t like adds but good other wise | So I got Spotify so I could listen to music obviously and everything was great even though I did not have premium. But then this new update came and the update is that it will always be on shuffle, and it literally adds songs to your playlists without permission. And the songs they add I absolutely hate. SPOTIFY FIX YOURSELF!! | It is so so good and would say better then Apple Music | The most recent | When my sister first got the app she could play it when ever even without wi-fi and there is adds but it’s like every 5 times the music changes . And it has every song ever made. I love it!!! | never should have update basically lost all the features i had | Consistency is what makes apps good and successful something this all has been fulfilling for a while. But all the sudden they replay songs and can’t even get through a song without glitching. I’m a premium subscriber so this is more of an issue as they have rose the price for premium and high quality music. But with the raised prices the quality goes down. My settings aren’t set up for failure it’s the app. Please fix the glitching in songs. Please don’t repeat songs unwantingly. And I’m fine paying for a good app. But it needs to be good. | Not

983156458,"com.microsoft.azureauthenticator","Microsoft Authenticator","https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?uo=4","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication

Multi factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless

Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill

Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts

Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/92/55/9d/92559da2-3b24-9a09-5511-c1cd242a5551/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-10-0-85-220-0.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Productivity"",""Utilities""]","[""6007"",""6002""]","Productivity",6007,"4+","[""AR"",""EU"",""BG"",""CA"",""HR"",""CS"",""DA"",""NL"",""EN"",""ET"",""FI"",""FR"",""GL"",""DE"",""EL"",""HE"",""HI"",""HU"",""ID"",""IT"",""JA"",""KK"",""KO"",""LV"",""LT"",""MS"",""NB"",""PL"",""PT"",""RO"",""RU"",""SR"",""ZH"",""SK"",""SL"",""ES"",""SV"",""TH"",""ZH"",""TR"",""UK"",""VI""]","201752576","15.0","2015-05-30T09:25:44Z","2024-03-05T18:38:59Z","We're always working on new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

I’ve tried for hours to get it to talk to my Microsoft account on my pc.    It just doesn’t work.   Sometimes the app and pc both give me codes to type into the other.   But the other won’t take a code.   Sometimes both will ask for codes and neither will give me one.

Everything works! No password needed just Face ID and number verification great app to use if you forget passwords easy/need extra security for your Microsoft account.

This app is required for my work but I wouldnt use it if it werent for. | VisionOS is capable of running iPadOS applications.  In the interest of transparency Microsoft should update customers on when or even if authenticator will be made available on VisionOS.  Is it taking so long due to technical issues or is it a business decision to not support Apple Vision Pro? | Myself and many others seem to run into the same issue with this app — you open a Microsoft app to sign in, and it reroutes you to Authenticator saying to input the security key presented to you… the only issue is: it’s already Authenticator. So how are we to “open Authenticator” to type in the key when 1) the app is already open 2) you’re shown the key but not allowed to type it anywhere? So the question stands: how are we to open the app when it’s already open? How are we to type in a key when the screen showing the key won’t go away? I use this App for work and I’ve been unable to sign into my accounts due to this issue and it’s been causing all kinds of counterproductivity. | Until Microsoft authenticator supports Vision Pro, I’m completely unable to use any other Microsoft apps. | It’s the hardest authenticator app to connect. | My Authenticator app is now only show 8 digit passcode rather than 6.  Most of the app I have only will take six digit. How do I switch? | The app is blocked for use on AVP, and won’t send a link to the Microsoft Auth app on your phone or iPad. This app seems to be going backward. Used to have Apple Watch support and pulled that, doesn’t support AVP like hundreds of review state. | I am going to initiate a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft for this. THE F-ING APP DOESN’T EVEN WORK, yet they force you to use it. How F-ing dare you. | ./night_shift.sh -sync | Let me begin with the cliche I would rate this infinitely lower if I could. I have been an avid and strong supporter of Microsoft for several years; first using it in the United States Navy then School and finally in the professional world, but this app and lack of support is ready to have me retract every good thing I have ever said about the company! I am having an issuing authenticating an account at my school. It is most likely the Schools fault. That being said there is no way to verify this as it is impossible to talk to a Microsoft representative over the phone. It is impossible to access support over chat without logging in to your account! I understand there are millions of problems every single day and it would be difficult for the company to address every single one, but don’t scale your company to the level that exceeds the volume of problems you are willing to address. Money hungry tech companies where CEO’s accumulate billions can’t expend the millions to outsource there trouble shooting it’s despicable and for the first time ever I am taking the time to rate an app and boy is this one a doozie. Shame on Microsoft may God have mercy on your positronic souls! | Please fix both the Microsoft Authenticator and the One Drive App.  Both are down and affect me from logging in on the application.  Please fix soon as possible | why require the use of your smelly spyware when we already have standard totp apps? why provide the option to add totp after installing this bloatware and then not allow its use? why not do it right, for once, for goodness sake? | I have no idea how to add my account onto my iPad? It should be easy but it’s not | None of the ms apps work for me until this is done | This app used to work now it is completely worthless.  But what’s worse is now instead of authenticating it forces me to text myself a code. Making the authentication not a authentication. It has been broken for at least 3 software updates and is a complete disaster for people who travel internationally. | Restores are painful to new iPhone, not easy | Normally I would blame user error, I’m 27 years old and I’ve worked at a tech company for 4 years. This app doesn’t provide the code when it’s needed and I have no idea how to access my email. | In 30 years of IT, I don’t think I’ve ever seen the rollout of a relatively new technology go so poorly, even by Microsoft standards.
The app works fine for its intended purpose, but the rollout of MFA is so confused,  haphazard, and poorly documented, that it makes us wish there was an alternative OS ecosystem.
Microsoft attempts to force all users to use Authenticator by default, instead of just a phone # or SMS, which has Admins ripping their hair out; and then the convoluted and myriad workaround suggestions by Microsoft support folks only add to the confusion.
Too big to succeed? | Quite often I cannot scan new QR code. Can’t add a new account. I am blocked. No error code and no way to troubleshoot. I have push notifications enabled. | It would be great if I can sign into my account for the first time without being asked to enter to 2 digit number to not be able to put the two digit code anywhere. I can’t access my Teams because of this issue. | Awful. Can’t use any enterprise Microsoft products. Just terrible. | worst experience ever, killing myself later | It does not work every time I try.  I am going to close everything associated with this app.  Switching to Apple away from Microsoft for everything.  Unbelievable | App currently isn’t allowed on the Vision Pro which means I can’t sign into my organization since they require this app to be installed on the device. | I've got a couple of different O365 accounts that require use of Authenticator regularly. Frequent (1 in 5 attempts) will fail with various error messages even if I enter the correct number. Over and over again. Kill the app. Restart it. Lather.Rinse.Repeat. 
So frustrating. | Easily one of the worst apps I have ever used. | Seriously? What is taking so long? Microsoft apps are unusable on AVP. | I just struggled through adding a new account. The instructions are unclear, the QR code did not work, and the alternative to the QR code, (which requires tryping out a long, confusing URL that appears on the computer screen into the app) is more or less impossible to do. I had to copy the URL into an email, email it to myself, switch from the Authenticator app to my email, open the email, copy of the URL, and then paste it into the Authenticator and and hope that it worked.

I never have such a dreadful, clunky experience with other providers like Google. | I cannot even get into my school email bc the app isn’t even working correctly | Very good | Come on Microsoft, get it published for the Vision Pro! | I don’t understand why this app isn’t enabled for Vision Pro | I had several accounts set up with Microsoft Authenticator for one time passcode access. My device suddenly died but when I reinstalled Microsoft Authenticator on a new one I discovered that these third party codes aren’t backed up with Microsoft account and have no way to be restored. Now I have to go to each of those accounts and get special support to circumvent the 2FA codes I can no longer access on my broken device. It’s a trap. Highly recommend alternatives which have restoration options | Is that a 1, an I, or an L? Is that a zero or a capital O? Who the heck knows?!

Use a better font you twits. | Come on Microsoft, this is ridiculous. Vision Pro support should’ve been there on day one. | I have an issue with the app. I put the authenticator on my Roblox account and it gives me an 8 code digit and not a 6 code digit. I’m disappointed on this. | 1.1 has been public now. Make this happen!! | Tóc Ông mầu trắng như gì vậy?
Tuyết có trắng không? | They should make this optional instead of forcing it on people. I am now stuck in an endless Authenticator loop where it gives me the two digit code to input but no place to input. I am unable to access my emails from my phone because of this. | A igual que muchos, creo que es la peor aplicación y más complicada de la vida. SAN ganas de no seguir haciendo lo que uno ocupa hacer. | I hate this app it never works right I got a new phone tried logging into my school email it takes me to the app tells me on the app to go to the app which I’m already on and type the numbers I see in but nothing pops up and I’m already on the app so why is it telling me to go to it so since I’m already on the app I just decide to press cannot use my authenticator app right now even thou I’m in the app and it has that option and it still doesn’t work I’m over this thing I’ve missed multiple emails because of it | I need this app in order to log into my school accounts. It does what it’s supposed to do and doesn’t let you log into an account (in this case my school accounts) without approval from this app. I had gotten a new phone over the weekend and was unable to access my old phone with the authenticator app on it. In order to log into the authenticator app you NEED the authenticator app otherwise you will not be able to log in.

VŠECHNY PRODUKTY NA JEDNOM MÍSTĚ
Na hlavní stránce naleznete základní přehled a informace o všech svých produktech a službách.

NEKONEČNÁ HISTORIE POHYBŮ
Všechny platby a karetní transakce naleznete ve Vaší transakční historii ihned po jejich provedení. Pro lepší orientaci většina obsahuje i logo obchodníka a má přiřazenou kategorii.

JEDNODUCHÉ DOMÁCÍ PLATBY
Nevyplňujte složité formuláře. Příjemce vyberte ze seznamu těch nejčastějších. Nebo použijte QR kód pro jednodušší vyplnění parametrů platby. Platbu mezi vlastními účty můžete provést tak, že na hlavní stránce podržíte prst na jednom z účtů a přetáhnete jej na jiný účet.

MÁTE PŘEHLED, ZA CO NEJVÍC UTRÁCÍTE
Nejen ke karetním transakcím automaticky přiřazujeme jejich kategorie. Kompletní přehled výdajů v jednotlivých kategoriích za daný měsíc si pak můžete zobrazit v přehledném grafu.

But a new update was installed on my phone a few days ago and, since then, the application will not display information in English — only in Czech. I am an expat living here since about two years and, unfortunately I do not understand enough Czech to navigate this app. So this is really a serious problem for me. | This is the best Bank app that I have used.

- Chybí důležité informace (např. mohu si deaktivovat cestovní pojištění u karty, ale nemohu zjistit jaké pojištění tam vlastně mám a kolik za něj platím ...)

Nová podoba se povedla! | How is it possible to make your job worse and worse? The home page of the new interface is stupidly filled by the absolutely unusable information.

I live in pacific standard time zone and recently started working for a firm based in the east coast so I am now working east coast hours starting at 5am meaning I have to wake by 4am. Prior to this job, I was lucky to get out of bed by 11am, regardless of what time I went to sleep. For the first week of my new job I woke up on time with like 15 minutes to get ready before jumping on my computer; with sleep monitor I am able to be up and refreshed at 4am like I need to be. I am so grateful for the app that has so far conquered my decades long battle with sleep issues!! | Wonderful to use while tracking sound and sleep patterns | It helps my sleep better and it tell me if I have been sleep talking I have been for a while but now it has gotten less and less for me I am so happy this has helped me so much!:) | How do I make sure subscription doesn’t renew | Es excelente por que tiene muchas funciones buenas. | Great! | App nice | I have slept better. | It helps me sleep at night | Funciona 👍 | I started this app about a month ago and it been really helpful with my sleep schedule. I never knew before if I snored and this app helped me realize I definitely do lol I enjoy the breathing exercises before bed and the sounds they have available. Most of all I enjoy the stats. Knowing my average sleep time and if I’m getting a deep enough sleep every night  10/10 recommend if you want to get to know yourself a bit better. | Apparently I slept great and was asleep all night not making a noise. Not. I woke up multiple times even got out of bed. Talked my my dog, dropped a book. All while this was recording and absolutely nothing. This is such a scam. | I am sleeping so much better now. I actually feel good the next day. | It’s so cool to hear what noises I make at night | Amazing recommend 100% | Really helps me track my sleep throughout the night and helps me know if I had good rest | Ffh | Awesome app | The best sleep I’ve ever had | I want to try it for a few days to see how it goes | I like how there is some music but I don’t like how you HAVE to pay to be able to hear your talking or snoring. I wish you didn’t have to pay bc some people can’t pay and that’s not fair. | Excelente sleep monitoring, improved sleep and increased overall mood | This thing works really good and it’s funny hearing if I sleep talk or anything like that | Muy bien | Very good!! | Great | Just starting. Will keep ya posted. | Excelente app para rastrear mis patrones de sueño. La recomiendo | Awesome | I like the app fr , helps me keep track of my medical promblem with my sleeping progress so it’s a big help. Only promblem I have with the app, should be free in my opinion like it’s not fully developed app yet. I would only charge people if you put more stuff into the app, for example like a alarm clock to wake you up. Y'all can come up with so much good ideas☺️. Keep up the good work creators | Can’t wait to try this tonight ! | :) | If you sleep with any type of fan (mine is a pretty quiet overhead fan), you will only get a “light sleep” rating all night due to “environmental noise”. So all your stats and recorded noises are thrown into chaos because the app doesn’t understand the fan life. 

Oh and if your heater/AC kicks on, heaven help your environmental noise score. 

Also, if you have a mattress that does lint transfer movements, the app thinks you don’t move all night long so your sleep scores are also incorrect. 

I also use the SleepWatch app (got this one to track how many times I cough, talk, etc) and the SleepWatch app uses your watch to track sleep patterns and score and it’s FAR better than this worthless app. 

Turned off auto renew and will likely never use it again. Waste of money. 

-10/10 recommend | Best sleep I have had in a very long time | Love | Otimo aplicativo, super recomendo 👍🏼 | I’ve had 3 back surgeries, all failed! I’ve had Hip Surgeries including a replacement, I have nerve damage, occipital neuralgia, and My Sleep Number is so soothing. Even though I received the wrong mattress, so I’m So Thankful 🙏🏼 Sincerely Lori ⭐️ | Love the app. | Costs money not cool I’m not paying just to track my sleep

686449807,"ph.telegra.Telegraph","Telegram Messenger","https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807?uo=4","Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 800 million active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

It’s a dark reminder to what crypto is. Interesting technology but misused and abused by the worst kinds of people. And unfortunately it’s those people who ruin it for everyone else. This app needs to be removed from the App Store. | Can u guys please let paying customers get unlimited pinned chats or atleast 50. | My app froze on iphone 11 | Why dose Telegram like to Bann number anyhow ok this application cause am tried of using different number on Telegram and they also Bann it | 怎么购买账号 | And it sends a notification to everyone that you downloaded the application?

Recent (frustrating) bugs that I am experiencing:
1) When in preview of sending someone an image, the buttons on the bottom act disabled and I cannot send (they are indeed not disabled but do not perform any action when tapped)
2) App crashes unexpectedly when sending attachments. This does not happen every time, but it is getting to the point where I lost count.
3) App crashes in general when sending a message.

I have attempted to uninstall and install to perhaps bandage these issues, but it has not helped. When I first got Telegram, over 5 years ago, the quality was absolutely superb. It’s my default and main messaging app, but with how it’s been working lately, it makes me incredibly unhappy.

Thank you | FOR SOME REASON I CANNOT MAKE AN ACCOUNT BC MY AGE THING WONT WORK | I love it and it good for my art🤨❤️‍🩹✨💕 | I used to love this app, I could spend hours looking and pinning. Now it’s all about pop ups and advertisements, this app has been ruined and I rarely use it anymore. It’s to bad because it was once great. | Having never reposted anything in any way explicit, I get an email from Pinterest about 5x a week telling me a pin of mine has been removed for violating community guidelines on sexually explicit content.  Each time I am unable to see what pin has been removed, but almost each time I use the link in the email to appeal the decision, and each and every time the pin in question is reinstated with an apology.

Pinterest at this point serves as an archive of mine for art, etc, that I’ve liked over the course of almost fifteen years.  It is highly aggravating to suddenly be subject to the piecemeal deletion of that archive, particularly when NOTHING in question violates these new “community guidelines.”  Pinterest needs to either revert to its former laissez faire (and appropriate) approach to content moderation or heavily reevaluate its current content ban algorithms. | Past few weeks I’ve experience this bug where I can’t post comments. I get a text box to enter my comment but no way to send. Works as expected on my laptop. 
Also I see no obvious way to quickly send this for help so I’m posting it here🤷🏽‍♀️ | The comments keep glitching. Some comments keep disappearing on the pins idk if it’s just me or something. The comments I have seen before are gone for some reason. | The app has become so glitchy in the last few months. Whenever I go to delete a pin it crashes and I have to restart the app. There’s no way to contact the app developers about this either. I may have to look into not using this platform anymore unfortunately because this is a serious issue. | It was a really great app in the beginning. Now it’s basically just adds. Once upon a time it offered suggestions based on your interests. Now it just gives adds. They completely sold out and it shows. Such a shame. It really used to be great. | Now on my feed, my hidden pins from my secret boards are showing up. I hide pins that are for example Christmas, until Christmas time so I can keep track of the seasons and times of year on my feed. I don’t care that others can’t see them. I don’t want to see my hidden pins from secret boards on my feed. Sometimes pins have no links so I save them on “random(my secret catch all board)” until I can find the source. Instagram and Pinterest do not configure sometimes so I save to my secret board till I can find the link. I save pins to multiple boards which then has two of the same pins on my feed. Also the new favorites button doesn’t work. Please return my feed to save pins, no secret pins. | Just Yes | So great I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤑 | Every time I try to scroll through the pins on my boards the app closes the board. It is impossible to scroll completely through the board. | Pinterest has literally a life saver from inspiration to heart warming pictures and to crafting! Pinterest is a ligitmate app <3 | there are more ads on my feed than there is content to pin. it's really ridiculous and makes the app awful to use. | Pottery videos flooding my feed for days….you are ridiculous | This is my fav app, the only thing I want back is the watch button, I miss it :( | there are far too many ads. like, each time i’m on the home page i will have minimum of one ad on my home screen. also, whatever the algorithm has been programmed to display is not doing it’s job - i see the same exact posts daily. like, within 15 minutes of scrolling. it’s definitely a good way to limit my screen time because it gets so frustrating i quickly close the app. | My algorith broke out of nowhere. Things that i never looked for are popping up! Deleting the app!! | It's so irritating to be on this app now. So many ads that it's miserable to scroll. It seems like every third thing is an add! I used to spend a lot of time on this app and now I'm debating on deleting it altogether | I CANT SIGN INN!!!!!!!!! | Pinterest is an AMAZING app but recently I haven’t been able to see my created pins. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PINTEREST!! | I enjoy looking for some new items! | I love the pictures and videos, keep up the work. It would be nice if there was a video section, where the icons are. | This is one of the best apps I have been on it’s fun, entertaining, and you can find all types of thing videos, wallpapers, and you can even save stuff so it won’t get lost. | this app is so helpful for pics, videos, gifs, inspo, etc. its like a diary! i luv my whisper girlies 💞 | Please fix this. Ive created around 20 pins but only 4 are showing up. My friend says she still sees them on my account but I can’t | So when I tried logging in it says I’m not eligible to join the app. So can you guys fix this please? | I used to spend hours on Pinterest, 10 years ago. It was so much fun. Now whenever I click on an image it’ll take me to Wattpad, a 404 message, or an article written by a bot. It’s gotten so spammy and full of ads. And they STILL haven’t fixed the issue with the home page refreshing after leaving the app then coming back later. I’m really frustrated and disappointed with how much worse Pinterest has gotten.

3/24- Update: It seems like there’s more ad videos now. The issue with refreshing has gotten a little better, I still don’t understand why the app developers thought refreshing constantly would be a good idea. 
Now I never see stuff from the people I follow, on my home page, anymore. It’s just all suggested stuff and ads. It’s really disappointing what Pinterest has become. | Love using this apt | Very nice app bought a ton of clothes because of Pinterest 😋 | Test | اصبح تطبيق سئ جداً فهو لايجعل خصوصيه للمستخدم يحذف المحفوظات في الملحق تلقائياً و ضعيف لا يعرض الصور ولا المقاطع بشكل جيد | I have this app on both my iPad and phone. On my phone I can make collages but I can’t on my iPad,but other than that no complaints I absolutely love the app!!!!!! | App crashes constantly, screen goes black. When I open a pin it closes the entire app and when I open it again it removes the home, search, and pin buttons. This has been going on for over a year with no fix, on 3 different phones too. Please update. | I love this app there is so many cute things like decor ideas, ideas for quiencenera’s,funny videos,cute videos and lots of memes and cute Fanart. But my problem is, if it says 12+ and I’m twelve and I put it in as 2011 it says you are not eligible to join Pinterest. So I used my dads account because I couldn’t create my own but I love Pinterest it’s an awesome app and it’s helping me plan my, room, cat supplies,hair and quincenera. Love 🫶🏼, anonymous | The new update messes up all of the commenting. I can no longer reply to others, I’ll be halfway through writing a comment and it will take away the type box and delete everything, I’ll even finish and press post and it doesn’t send the comment. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it, it’s been completely ruined with this update. | ok. usually when apps companies update their app it gets better. NOT PINTEREST APPARENTLY!!!! i cant message people through the app anymore, nor can i see my followers. and some of my friends and family that i follow it wont show. not even when i search for their profile. there are also many different dumb unnecessary updates, like when i post something it wont allow me to turn on comment. i’ve asked others if these things are the same for them- and surprise surprise it is. and on top of all of this it randomly turned my business account to a normal account messing up a lot of stuff i’ve been working on for months. i’m 16 years old and the terms of service says that if you’re 16 years old or older you should have control over this stuff. also they do random updates where it completely messes up my For You to just random stuff like makeup, jordans, and nail stuff, which i have never saved or marked as my interests. which there is nothing wrong with people who like that, i just personally don’t like that stuff. so why is it being recommended as the default even though i never saved anything like that? and if mark as “irrelevant to me” it still shows it. so i doubt customer service will see this, but please fix these problems. and fix them the right way. i really do love pinterest but every time they do something weird to it i start using it less and less. | I used to love going on Pinterest for inspiration, but now there’s an ad almost every other post (not even including promoted content). This makes it extremely difficult to use the app. | Hairstyles for my long hair

for a fresh brewed Coffee filled Yeti, 
sit in my ride, engage in mind drifting, listen to Smooth Jazz & vist Pinterest 
to pick out around 5 interesting pictures 
to upload to FaceBook with my personal thoughts across the top 

Just for the record, I take Pride in 
the pictures that I select 

I certainly appreciate the variety of pictures available to choose from and again, 
I engage in that action every single day 

In fact, I look foreword to doing so

                                          A. K. A. Yanni | Every single pin I open lately is an ad!!!! | It only shows you what it has decided you will see.

Your entire feed will become these few things you hate!

It will vehemently pile those upon you without any working customization for yourself. Even after saying you do NOT want to see it EVERY TIME IT POPS UP, pinterest will continue to shove it down your throat and only show you those.

 I have boards that pinterest out right refuses to show more similar or related content about that is not against the guidelines and has a plethora of unseen content that I've searched for, tapped on, liked, and saved! The worthless algorithm is stuck and cant update based on its own customization that it consistently and annoyingly thrusts upon the users | When I try to zoom in on a picture it freezes up my phone.  Why can’t this issue be fixed? | I love this app but there are way too many ads. | i’ve noticed pinterest has started deleting my replies to comments on my pins. super frustrating as i will reply to

I used to be able to scroll down and see everyone I ever chatted with in order of most recent. Now it cuts off, and sorts in some people I haven’t spoken with in years. And there doesn’t seem to be any way to get it back to the way it was. This is disorienting and upsetting. I don’t want the app to try and be helpful by sorting in people I searched once, just stay out of my way and give me access to my own information on my own terms. Would it be out of the question to revert this new ordering system to how it was or at least provide an option? Consider the feature request with high priority please. | If you send images or media from others, it takes a. If you close the messenger and enter again, then you can see it.
Please solve the problem quickly.
Thank you | I use this on the daily to keep in tough with my family and friends. It’s a very easy app to use. | FOR WHAT !!!!!!!!! Just to piss us off you done well | app is fine except now you need a pin or you cant use messenger on another phone after your current one. Thats stupid | Last message I sent earlier today shows that it was seen March 8th. This is not right. Why is it showing the wrong date? | Some of my friend can’t send me massage cause showing “You can’t send massage this account” | My previous account was hacked and I haven’t been able to get it back; it’s still active. It would be nice to have more options to retrieve your account if hacked.

Also, recently, friends haven’t been able to message me but I never blocked or restricted them. | True and sad | You cowards censored my photos. You’re cracking down before the election as usual. I really hope that somebody actually gets in your way to stop you.  It was really weird to see the thing that come up and said you sure you want to do this and now I can’t even add photos because you decided to disable it on me. Jerks. | The new update broke the account switching and now it won’t let me switch to my personal account | How much user information has Facebook, Apple, & Microsoft sold or given away for free? Predators. All these companies forcing more pins, longer more complicated passwords, and they all send me sms text messages to confirm my identity. What do you want from the users of this app?  All these extra security measures for what purpose? You’ve already sold or freely given away everyone’s phone numbers, emails, passwords, addresses, etc. What is going on here? | I’ve used messanger for years. After the Outage last week, I have been completely unable to access my account. Says to retry the app, but I have done so hundreds of times. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled even more times. Years of contacts gone. Thanks. | Stop trying to force us to create a chat history pin. | What happened to messenger? When you share something from FBMP, it doesn’t show the link, it shows tons of codes. | Why I can’t skip using PIN to access my Facebook Messenger App. It supposed to be optional… I think I am done with FB Messenger at least for now. Let’s see what happens! | Your community standards is annoying | My notifications have stopped working!! Everything in my settings is turned on but all of the sudden I am not receiving any messenger notifications. I even tried deleting and reinstalling the app. My cousin went through the same thing for months! | I was just forced to download the latest update and now I no longer receive message notifications.  Notifications are turned on, I've toggled on/off and restarted iPhone. Nothing! Please fix!! 👎🏻 | If I could give zero stars I would. Since I can’t the one star will suffice. Messenger forcing me to create a PIN code is Moronic. We as users should have the option to not have to create one. | I don’t like suggest channel nothing interesting to watch remove it please or stop showing it because it’s so annoying | Literally catering to cheaters and liars. | For the last week and a half or so, despite checking my settings that allow for all incoming messages from people I’m not friends with to go to my Message Requests , all incoming message senders see is that I’m “ Not Receiving Messages”   I have sent multiple support requests and I’ve heard nothing. I am being removed from groups. I’ve joined because one of the rules is not blocking Admin and they are saying I am blocking them. I can’t even communicate with some people now. I have no idea friends or other people have tried to message me and I just don’t know it, it’s ridiculous and I’d really like some help | Can not use on my iPhone anymore 😡 | I’ve cleared every section in Messenger to no avail. What gives???? | This feature is blocking out 90% of my chat contacts window on iPhone. 

Also, I don’t want random people showing up in messaging app. 

Searching online says there’s a way to do it previously, but that option is missing in the 2024 version of the app.

Any help would be appreciated! | Hey how come you guys will not let us use our persona pictures for background photos? | it’s RIDICULOUS that this isn’t already an option

fb has *at least* 18 categories of notifications with customizable push/email/txt ..but if someone in one of your groups PMs you, the only way to find out is to keep checking your special box like you’re waiting on mail through USPS | Please fix the problem i can't add notes on my messanger too | It’s buffed asl but I updated it and then is said bug fix needed and I haven’t been able to access my account ever since | Today I was on my phone just texting friends next to you know I apparently I guess I send a thumbs up to somebody that I don’t even know and don’t even have added as a friend and then it’s requesting money and it keeps happening. It’s like someone hacked into my account when the whole Facebook and messenger went down a while ago and I have changed my password and I’m still getting this problem so if someone can fix it, I would appreciate it because I don’t wanna have to make a new one because this is technically your app. Your fault I do have proof that it has happened. I have a picture I have posted it on Facebook wondering why it’s happening but I don’t know if it’s happening to other people but it’s clearly happening to me so something is wrong with the app right now | This app needs to be added to Apple car play android has it on their phones but not for Apple this needs fixed | ko tốt | Why would you have the option to delete or unsend your sent message that you didn’t mean to send but sent and can’t undo it anymore?????!!! Fix this | Los videos no se envian ni se ven | This is a predatory business strategy. Flat out. The implication of this being that if I refused to update my phone I would be artificially locked out of using certain features, not because of a compatibility issue, but because They just can. | Honestly it would be fine except for the amount of spammer/scammers that are always trying to get ur info thru it. It’s insane. I never use it anymore and much prefer just using a google voice number and being able to text freely thru it since people have no way of knowing it’s not ur real number. But messenger is the number one way to get ur account on FB hacked so if somehow you been under a rock for years and are just now seeing this…be careful on messenger. You will get ur fb account hacked 7/10 times if using this… | Be original and stop REQUIRING everyone to do an update just to get the same idea and concepts that we already have on instagram and tik tok. Let the two be its own individual accounts. | Please fix it why always asking me confirm my phone number and access my contact. I will increase star if it fixed. Thank. Now I can’t send videos from my iPhone 12 Pro Max to any my friends. | Everytime you guys do an update something is always messing up rather it’s the chats or if it’s the stories it’s always something . | For a messenger app it’s fine. Easy to find folks and send a message to them. I also like that they support video calls so I don’t have to give my number out when using Marketplace. I just wish it had a filter to show you all unread messages. Ever since the last update mine always shows I have one unread but I have opened every chat I have and I can’t get it to go away. | I don't receive my notifications even though my notifications turned on. On the plus side, I like the themes usually. Maybe add more though. | Cheaters you looser dirty dog right place for you to hang out at | App is trash I just updated it last week and now it’s forcing me to do it again against my will just like last week 😠 | Where is the background themes? Its gone! | Ont allow  me to update the
 messanger app. Has someone else’s Apple ID to log in. Not familiar with the Apple ID.! | When someone sends me a voice message it’s like the speed is turned on high. It’s been like this for weeks and hasn’t been fixed and I can’t fix it. But other then that I love this app | Just updated and now doesn’t work. | After doing the most recent update I now need to create a 6-digit pin to keep my chat history. This is the worst thing you could do!!! We have passwords and two factor authentication for a reason!!! This needs to go away!!!!! | Should really be updated to have CarPlay functionality, it’s been available on android for a good while now.

Super sweet, fast shipping | I purchased something and the seller sent me the wrong item. I reached out to Vinted and they didn’t do anything but “punish” the seller (they are still selling). Don’t see the point of paying extra for buyer protection if it doesn’t help with anything. | Nicely packed 😊 | Many shipping issues and customer support will not reply for days. | Thank you so much! Everything is perfect :) | Very good seller | The purse shows no flaw.very satisfied of my purchase. | Thank you everything is perfect ! | Great seller. Very accommodating and ships my jacket right away. Thank you.  May God bless you in Jesus His Son.  With much love,  Grace | Thank you ! | This app use to be my favorite now it’s gone down hill the shipping prices are crazy high it’s like every week they add something new to charge I’m about to delete this app | A scammers paradise!! Sellers frequently steal tracking numbers from the dark web and then never send the items they sell. Since the tracking numbers show delivery, it appears legitimate and there is nothing that can be done for the buyer. There is NO PROTECTION for buyers. I had over $100 stolen from me. Wish I had known about this scam | Envoi très rapide et montre en très bon état comme mentionné dans la description 👌 | Omg this is perfect! Thank you so much! | I made a listing that was authentic and I have proof of my purchase yet I was blocked for “illegal activity/scamming” through the automatic detector. It’s ridiculous and the checks are not thorough. My listing looked exactly like the others for similar items and I used my own pictures I took through my iPhone so I don’t see the issue. I would never use this selling platform again! | Amazing! | Won’t let me look at anything without forcing me to make an account, you can close out of the pop up but it reappears constantly and quits you out of your search | The item was in perfect condition, delivered fast. Thank you so much! | I tried to use this app twice to buy and both times did not receive my item. One was cancelled and one never showed up. The customer service was, in addition to being very hard to find, of no help. Such a pity. | Desperately needs to let us categorize our favorites! I would purchase double the amount I do now if I could put things in categories to compare them! I thought it used to have this function, why get rid of it? | Beautiful thank you!!!! | The items we’re packaged with care and arrived in pristine condition!  Shipping was fast. Highly recommend ! | Amazing seller!!! Managed to organise and have items delivered in time for me leaving for holiday. Great communication. | well actually my butt looks kinda small in these LMFOAOA but they r so cute i love first order and im luvin this app! brought them from the sweetest person ever she reassured me that i was not getting scammed and all so sweet will buy from her again 😜😜😜 | Great seller ❤️ | Don’t even bother to download the App.. as soon as I made an account it was suspended for no reason at all.. NOT WORTH THE DOWNLOAD! | Fast delivery, everything is in tact | You are disgusting I registered myself the first time in my life and you excuse me of fraud…i can’t talk to the support snd nobody tells me what is going on | My account got blocked for suspected fraud. I don't know why :( | Good app if you are selling cheap stuff, wouldn’t recommend it for expensive stuff, my original item got removed and i received zero customer assistance despite waisting a boosting as well. I would suggest more professional apps like Grailed. | My package arrived promptly and the item was exactly as described! Thanks so much! 😁 | The ads given stop my music I am listening to and it is very annoying, makes me exit the app because of how much of a nuisance it becomes. | This is a good app with solid design and functionality, but I’ve experienced too many lags! Pages will not load and I’m stuck with the dreaded spinning wheel. It happens every time I use the app. | Love everything about Vinted, but when I use it it is constantly popping up an error message “whoops! Something went wrong” it’s hard to navigate when this message is constantly popping up. | FAST shipping, FAST communication really really nice and easy to deal with !! Thanks so much !!!!!! | Excellente ♥️♥️♥️ | Fast easy transaction. Recommended ! | Good communication and fast delivery, thank you :) | Everything was in good condition and fast shipping. Great communication and great pricing service i am a satisfied, customer. 😃 | Fast shipping, item just as described ✨ | Vendedora súper amable. El abrigo una pasada🥰. Todo perfecto | Customer support is terrible if you ever have an issue. Sure, the prices are great and you might get lucky with some great finds, but if you EVER have an issue with it, you’re toast. I bought a bag on here that was a little pricey after fees (even after I made an offer), and it came smelling like straight smoke and beef jerky. Because I made an offer, Vinted said they can’t do anything about it. Tried to contact the seller and silence. I’m stuck with a bag that makes me nauseous but I spent too much money to give it to Goodwill 😭 STICK WITH MERCARI AND POSHMARK. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. | Vendedora de 10. | Gracias!! | Perfcet seller | They blocked me after I record face oil next box. I wanna show that oil is full and new. They framed me that cosmetic is used. You wrote with robot and nobody cares that is not true 😞 | 😍😍😍 | Everything was fine, I like the items and they are better than they’ve been described 😂 | Tout est parfait 
Le pull l’emballage la livraison 
Mille mercis | You can only translate to  English on your computer and not on your phone app. This makes it really hard if you use your phone mostly. I hope they update this app to make it more user friendly for international users. 

Also watch out for scammers! I got scammed immediately. I scanned a QR code and it directed me to a site that was identical to Vinted. It told me to put my information in to receive payment.  There is no way to get your money back if you do this. If your new don’t scan any QR codes, it will direct outside of the website or app. Don’t expect any photos as payment. I’m blocking scammers almost every day.",4.87532,121048,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/4d/ba/02/4dba0262-7b99-b3f2-294b-c1a582d0dad6/3d452b77-8be8-4863-b410-05a9d1c588c8_App_store_-_UK_-_5_U002c5_inch-_1_A-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/8b/d4/0c/8bd40c79-dcc8-0a49-b470-cd6c904fd962/52582915-05d7-4b2d-ac2b-8df3f086570a_App_store_-_UK_-_5_U002c5_inch-_2_A-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/ef/62/b0/ef62b040-3b62-4a4e-fcef-cdc419746038/421bb1e5-369c-4f34-90f0-5a567c67f8c5_App_store_-_New_USPs_-_5_U002c5_inch_-_UK_-_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/73/db/d2/73dbd25e-4e5f-90a1-5de7-c0920650e679/eed2e91b-9b6a-4dac-9ae0-ef2ff04b4513_App_store_-_New_USPs_-_5_U002c5_inch_-_UK_-_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/67/38/41/673841d7-f0d3-4a3d-fec9-ac326daa08bf/f7c10409-28f2-4d89-bc8d-0f5043f2fda8_App_store_-_New_USPs_-_5_U002c5_inch_-_UK_-_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/8e/b1/be/8eb1beec-559c-e887-24ba-a0f543cee6c7/79973b4e-591d-41b4-9f6a-e9969fcea031_App_store_-_New_USPs_-_5_U002c5_inch_-_UK_-_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/87/24/1f/87241ffc-9f83-ee01-79d0-eaf3b2fadeba/d1c53e89-80bb-445f-b469-a6818b23f22a_App_store_-_New_USPs_-_5_U002c5_inch_-_UK_-_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/03/44/5d/03445d9b-7196-4f71-bead-2db7430c2770/3cea4544-c6c5-4725-9e52-12597bac489d_App_store_-_New_USPs_-_5_U002c5_inch_-_UK_-_8.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/5e/4d/80/5e4d80ea-1f96-718f-5726-f676a05b65ae/94596f07-47a1-426b-a29f-bc5fa1a2c56a_App_store_-_UK_-_Ipad_-_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/c4/45/b7/c445b7bb-9494-8a8a-be31-794d2edf9b90/1577cc95-57d4-4548-991f-dccacf5bb2b7_App_store_-_UK_-_Ipad_-_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/90/8c/46/908c4609-4b8e-f443-1217-dffa963a83d3/06b2b333-8dad-4fd8-98e5-e6213f7079c8_App_store_-_UK_-_Ipad_-_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/fd/e3/72/fde3726a-71eb-3577-121b-57a7abe31552/106d48ce-d5c1-4d5c-9574-3110eff00e11_App_store_-_UK_-_Ipad_-_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/28/7a/18/287a18d3-8c6b-ca66-ffbb-a907454c6c4d/49ae401a-5d73-4e5c-bb21-8eee7599727c_App_store_-_UK_-_Ipad_-_5.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAir

Plus, discounts are offered on just about everything from the rooms to the taxis!  I highly recommend Booking.com!! | Muy recomendado me gusto mucho muy céntrico y el personal excelente el hotel es pequeño muy sencillo y muy limpio . Solo sugiero que le pongan mas luz ala acotación muy oscura pero muy recomendado 👍 | Booking.com has never failed me finding hotel and rental car prices great job | We have used this app many times before great app | Excellent very easy and friendly user. | Customer service was great Rocky was very helpful and very friendly, I appreciate his customer service and recommend staying here | Love it! | Stayed here before, rooms were good, clean & breakfast was ready on time& very good. Booking.com was easy & quick to use. The price quoted by booking.com is different from actual price, sometimes almost double.  Just have to watch out. But I will use them again. | Very fast, very informative, very easy to use. | If you are visiting the Vatican, this is where you want to stay. While it was only 2 of us on this trip, this apartment can accommodate 5 comfortably. If you have the opportunity, don’t pass this up! | Use App many many times. Very reliable and super informative bookings.😁 | จองผ่านbooking.com รวดเร็ว ฉับไว ราคาถูก มีตัวเลือกมากมาย | We left some items behind in our hotel room. The hotel staff saved it for us and contacted us about it. Very helpful and nice of them!
Very pleased with the hotel. | If you try to contact property via chat in the app. The app just crashes. Copy your message before you press send. The app will crash. So you will have to paste the message a few times and then it might be sent | I love this App!!  I’ve never been disappointed the many times I’ve used for reservations. It’s easy, affordable, and very informative!! | They have added so many options to the room choices for no refund and limited refund times that by the time you book you miss the fact that the date was not the date you originally picked.  I did everything including contacting the hotel to correct and they left me hanging.   Done don’t use it.  Hotel desk says it is happening quite often. | Almost always use on last minute trips. | Multiple issues in the first month of using. I booked 8 different stays in the last two months and was trying Booking.com out for the first time. Previously I have used multiple other sites and vacation rental sites. At first glance it appears to work smooth but now after multiple issues and poor customer service I'll be switching back and no longer using this app. | He utilizado Booking.com varias veces y nunca he tenido problemas. Los recomiendo. | Rooms were clean and accommodating the staff was very courteous and the location could not be more centric ( one block to the beach and half block to 5th ave were all the shops and restaurants are located. The pool was very nice also. | we were her for 6 nights. Great staff very friendly and helpful. place is rundown but clean. In a vey populated area but easy to get to anywhere. | Love using booking.com app.
It’s extremely easy and convenient | The room was clean, neat and comfortable.  I stayed 2 nights, slept well both nights. Wear a sleep mask because there is a street light out front.  I was grateful to find these accommodations so close to the convention center.  Three days parking downtown was almost the price of the room before tax.  I recommend this room for one adult who needs to sleep and perhaps handle some computer paperwork while in the room.  The kitchen was accessible, clean and the two bathrooms shared by 4 rooms were both clean and nice.  Good Job, landlord! | This stay was very convenient and accommodating. I had 24/7 assistance for any questions or concerns I may have had. The location was very convenient for me as I was there for business. The house was very clean, spacious, and up to date !

The location is in the city but I loved that the most about it because I am a CITY GIRL !

I’ll definitely be returning and I would recommend this stay 100 % | Easy booking or change | Súper clean, modern beautiful decoration, the owner, Iris super nice. Let us check it very early and check out very late | This app is very easy to use. And you get a good price. | Amo la app. Protege mucho al cliente. Altamente recomendada | The holiday inn is one of my favorite hotels and they serve a great breakfast here. The staff are amazing and the rooms are super clean and comfortable. | I always check booking.com first to find hotels at where I’m going because it offers easy ways to navigate through so many different options. It’s an essential app for travelers! | Удобно, быстро, надежно | اشكر طاقم عمل بودل وبلاخص الاخ محمود المصري اسلوب راقي وتعامل سمح عسى الله يبيض وجه ويرزقه من حيث لايحتسب | Wonderful clean apartment new up to date furniture and beds nice modern look!!  No hassle owner quick and easy got here and went to sleep Ty | App is easy to use!  I always refer to the app
When I am setting up a trip    Glad I found it! | Have used Booking.com for the last 25 yrs 
Above and beyond pleased with service❤️ | OK, seriously the owner, Maclir goes above and beyond. You can tell he really wants his guests to have a good experience and is passionate about his place. First off, he reached out to me before I arrived and offered to come pick me up from the ferry for a small fee. I have NEVER had anyone from a hostel do this. This was way better than getting a taxi and he popped out of no where at the pier it was so welcoming and honestly set the tone for how amazing my experience was in this island. As soon as we arrived to the home stay he gave me a run down about the island. Which beaches to go, where to eat and what there is to do. Again, goes above and beyond. I ended up having to move to a new location since he was fully booked and I wanted to stay longer which I was a little sad about but he even helped me move my stuff to my new place. Like I said he’s a really good guy and willing to always help out his guests. The rooms were cute, he definitely keeps up with them and even makes your bed for you which I appreciated. I was amazing at how on point he is! | اكثر من رائع جعل للذي ابتكر هذا التتطبيق للجنة يارب | I really this motel the workers really nice love the rooms | Two bookings in a row have been completely screwed up - one never went to the property, but thankfully they had room and were able to book me manually at check-in.  The second I
Booked a year in advance and did not get the room type that I reserved, and ended up in a room that did not fit our family.  Only two stars because we did end up getting some sort of room, but I cannot trust the app to work correctly. | They moved their headquarters to Netherlands. Now they are not under the better business bureau. Their customer service is not responding or either responding and hanging up to your face. They are doing very shady business. Saying that they didn’t get any response from the hotel but when the hotel send us the emails between the hotel and booing.com they agree to do a refund. Only it has been a month and they didn’t issue the refund. The customer service is not responding. Never ever use that app or website again. It should be banned. | Everything was good | Was fast an easy booking | I lived here shear and looking to go back for a glorious year once again !! | Have been using booking for years and it’s service has definitely surpassed all the others I’ve used including a company provided booking with discounts site, I can always find good deals although please be aware that some properties that use booking are shams and not to be trusted. Let’s build a booking community with only safe hotels and stays where everyone can see in reviews the bad and poor business some hospitality places practice! | El depa muy bonito limpio accesible sin ruido una ducha enorme y abundante todo funciona al 100 gracias regreso | perfect place, perfect people! i recomend it with 100% 🫶🏻 | For a few days now messages are not being loaded, either on the app or on the web. Customer Service only offers ways to report an issue with a booking, not with the app / website itself, which is both annoying and frustrating. | This app finds you the great deals for hotels it helped me when I went to Washington DC I recommend anyone to get this app you won’t be disappointed | Although we haven’t had much luck with the properties where we have stayed, I have to give a resounding “THANK YOU, BOOKING!!!!”. I’ve never had such amazing success with customer service experiences and this one has been world class!!! Thanks for resolving all of our issues and being a true concierge service.

Reakce developera je sice pravda ale je potřeba se na to podivat z širšího pohledu a v souvislosti faktu.

Nothing. | An awesome app 👍👍 | It doesn’t calculate well from my home to work, supposedly other app tells me that I do 16 minutes but this app tells me that I do 7 minutes please fix the traffic live | لماذا لاتوجد لغه عربيه | This app was invaluable during our trek on TMB. It showed TMB trails and variants.  I’ll use it for future hikes! | The visualization and readability of Mapy is second to none. And their routing instructions (voice and pointers, etc) are super. 
What I find frustrating is that the app doesn’t seem to be able to find destinations unless they are entered exactly as in the database. A misspelled name (maybe a “Wisslerstr.” Vs a “Wißlerstr”, a slightly different postal code (eg D-61234 vs 61234) or other things -  and the  the search comes up empty!

And occasionally the routing is not functioning (try walking to Venlo station from Germany sometime… you end up standing in front of an empty field) or is really silly (like going around three corners just to return to the original street). 
But there’s great potential there, and it has supplanted my other guidance apps (except for Google maps, I still keep that to check…) | Absolutely amazing!!! Awesome tool if you’re planning a hike or a bike trip. | Have enough maps.  Used windy for weather. Will delete app now that it is map and not weather. | For Georgia, the map is very old. There is some building from 2018-2017 and some routes, with not seen in app. Take maps from openstreet maps ♥️ | I have been using Mapy for five years and have found it incredibly useful for hiking in the many places I have been (US, Europe, North Africa). The amount of detail is astonishing and always correct. Even in the kasbahs of Morocco it proved useful. The tracking feature is handy for documenting my hikes. Unfortunately I have been unable to open an account since that seems to require a Czech email address. | This app combines benefits of general Google-like street map with reasonable level hiking map. It is a good compromise for both. | Gôigo | Well done | Excellent maps and totally free. No commercials. Five stars for that.
One downside is a very poor integration with other apps by seznam.cz. | “What’s the news” note is on screen when I open app. I am not able to close the note and go to map, because the “go to map” button is below and out of the screen view, so I can’t go to the map. I have an iPad Pro. Their web site email site is not in English, so I can’t sent call for help!

Update: deleted app and redox loaded it again, so now it is working.
Another problem with app is when traveling the interstate highways the app wants me to get off at exits and get right back on?
Also directions are sometimes very wrong, so I have to carefully review and change by adding stops.
This is a overall a great app, especially using it for biking paths and recording trips. | By far my favorite mapping app. It’s so good to zoom in and in until you see walking paths at mountains. Plus it’s the rare map that displays house numbers along the street. | How do I switch from kilometers to miles? | I have been using mapy.cz for 5 years for trail running/hiking and I love them for good quality offline trail maps. I’ve been using them in Czech Republic, Ukraine, USA, they are pretty good everywhere

Only issue I ever had is that once it happened that my offline maps became inaccessible and required an update at an inconvenient moment: while I was out in the mountains with bad connection. Thanks God, the connection was good enough to use online maps at least. Otherwise, I would be screwed | Supr appka, nejlepší aplikace pro pěší výlety a podobně. Dále je možné stáhnout mapy offline.
Chtělo by to vylepšit možnost ukládání oblíbených míst, ideálně možnost přiřadit danému místu ikonu, tak jak to lze např. v aplikaci Peepkey. Díky za vylepšení!! | Well designed layout.
OK routing engine. 
Excellent for the quick trip planning. 

Missing on some very important features:

1. Lacking ability to save favorite places and routes without need to register / login / internet access (other apps alike allow for that functionality) 
2. Lack of detailed TOPO layer maps missing on many beautiful routes. 
3. For MTB you are better of using their Hiking routes for the most part. Their MTB / road routes include forest gravel roads but exclude any narrower gravel or dirt roads even those are highway like to MTB or CX or Touring bike. 

Overall great app with room for improvement. 

Cheers! | Best app for hikers, cyclists or skiers. This app helped me to find the correct route in sticky situations. You can download the maps to your phone for free. Thank you Seznam.cz for this awesome app. | App was highly recommended for euro biking. It will not let me look at bike routes between cities a few days in the future; will only start at my current location. So far it’s of no help. Here We Go is free and works. | The app doesn’t run, it crashes! | Very nice guide for biking, walking and hiking. All bike ways in Italia as well. I don't use any other app to orient. | Mapy cz jsou moji nejpouzivanejsi mapou. Pouzivam hlavne turistickou a leteckou verzi. Jedine co mi chybi je rozmisteni postovnich schranek. | Dobre, ale kdy prijde verze podobna android aplikaci? | Great and useful app! | Frequent crashes on ios9 when bringing it back to screen after switching somewhere else. Likely it is memory related problem. Will keep trying with mr10. | And it is czech product! :) | We live in Cesky Raj and have recently taken up cycling. Having downloaded the offline version of the Czech Republic on to an iPhone 6s, the chances of us getting lost are pretty well zero. Even with a poor E signal the app pinpoints exactly where we are. The cycle trails are very clear, the cartography is much above average and we couldn't be more pleased. The app offers route choices for car, cycling and walking and can open up more information about points of interest. There are many more features available and the price is right! | Mapy.cz konecne dostaly podporu pro ipad, konecne jsme se dockali. Rozhrani je sice telefonni (stahnout spravnou mapu vyzaduje pomalu pravitko...), ale aspon uz mapa zabira temer cely displej.

Dekuji za (konecne) nejlepsi mapu CR :-) | Nova verze vypada velmi slibne. Chybi mi moznost kdyz mam v planovani vice mist pro jeden vylet, chybi moznost jednoduse menit poradi cilu, stejne jako na webu. | This app saved my butt numerous times, got me thru Prague driving, and even shows house numbers in the small villages. Offline map saves your data allotment. IMHO, this is the one real must-have besides Google Translate. | Super app, from small country. | Doufala jsem, že budu moct používat tuhle app při jízdě na kole. Ale jsem hrozně zklamaná. Aplikace “nenaviguje”, neotáčí se jako klasická GPS, není možné upravit trasu, při schování na pozadí (kvůli šetření displaye baterky) se “vynuluje” cílová destinace… radši bych zaplatila i 50 USD za update, aby to fungovalo, než mít aplikaci, která mě brutálně frustruje…. :( | Myslel jsem, ze aplikace využije na tabletu všechny moznosti, ale jsme totálně zklamaný. Displej se neotaci podle natoceni tabletu a royliseni je tragicke v režimu tom z nějakého iPhone 1. | Must get for exploring areas off beaten path! | Velmi dobra aplikace bohužel s nefunkční aktualizaci map. ""Stáhněte si aktualizaci mapy"" bohužel vždy skončí na hlášce ""Chyba. Něco se pokazilo ..."" Tento problem přetrvává dlouhodobě. | Great app, just wish the information about sites had an option to translate. | Opět bez chyb, pokud nepočítáme iPad. | Byl bych moc rad abych mohl používat mapy i pro Ipad nato se neda dívat jak Jeto zvětšené. Jinak apk super jen tak dal | I am very satisfied!! Perfect! | Nejde naplánovat trasu!?

Use one of the other delivery apps instead | Wolts become my favorite delivery app, orders are generally delivered very quickly and the app is very easy to use. The only downside is the customer service bot before connecting you to representative can be annoying but I have to say.... Wolt has always stood by their service and has always refunded in the case of a mistake made without dragging me along. For that great app.... If something goes wrong you don't have to worry.... Some might say too good lol I've ordered over 80 times this year it's too convenient. | I ordered khinkali from “shemometchama” restaurant , I was waiting for 1 hour and 30 minutes, then I have received a call from restaurant and they told me my order is ready already for 30 minutes and no one picked it up!!!! SO IT WAS COLD!! I texted support and they told me that they are “sorry” I said I won’t pay for the cold food because it is their issue not mine. I asked them to cancel the order but instead they blocked my access to my cash payment!!! Bravo bravoo you idiots I won’t use you app anymore !!! | საუკეთესოა ქალაქში 💯 | Wolt application is great but the service itself is the worst I’ve ever experienced on delivery market. Every second delivery is late for 1 - 1,5 hours and there is zero customer support | Nice and user-friendly design :) | The worst app and service i have ever seen | Much easier to use | order food, get it raw, ask customer support for help and they confirmed with kfc that they did everything all good. my dog liked those wings | Expect a wait, and expect the estimated time to be 30 minutes to 2 hours later then it says. I’ve had 100+ orders and most of them are very late. | An empathetic app if there ever was one, with user flows that fulfill your every desire in a delivery app. The drivers are always delightful which speaks highly as to how the company treats people. | Service in Serbia is horrible, i deleted app because of the customer service . Very bad and unproffesional. | There is no way to register on this app. It wont send me SMS verification code. Support is terrible, taking forever to answer and not helping with anything. | всегда долгая доставка еда остывает пока доедет и многие заведения не правильно кладут заказ всегда чего-то не хватает или там волосы | Ordered from Wolt Market, order accepted waited for 30-35 minutes, and order rejected. | After a 3 week trip to belgrade back in october, i am back again and one thing I have been looking forward to is Wolt! It’s a thousand times better than doordash or glovo, I tell everyone back at home in america to stop using doordash so they are forced to step up their game! | Pls allow adding photos to delivery address | If you want to be disappointed with your order, you can try ordering from them | Worst customer service in budapest | Do not expect any help with your orders. If you have any issues regarding your order, they will fight back tooth and nail be ever giving you a refund. | If you’re a tourist or a short term resident or you enter your card number incorrectly a couple of tomes the app will automatically ban you and you can’t order food or do anything about it | Prevaranti, dobijes kredit i samo ti blokiraju da ne mozes da koristis i nikome nista... | Their couriers contact you via third party applications (Viber, Whatsup, Facebook, Instagram, etc…)

They use rude and commanding language. | I ordered a surprise gift for my moms bday. They couldn’t find my address ( I have had deliveries to my address before may times without any issues). And they charged the poor driver when I said it didn’t get delivered to my mom. Imagine you are a teller and they take every shortage of your teller cash from your paycheck. It’s crappy and unfair to drivers. The app only makes sure it gets its money without any expenses. | Amazing delivery time and very concerned to find the right person, good energy!! | Great app, love it!
Please make iPad version.
Dynamic island support would be great addition. | I’ve been consistently disappointed with Wolt’s food delivery service. The customer service is unhelpful, and there’s a recurring issue of missing items from my orders. Despite reaching out, the policies seem to favor the company rather than addressing the customer’s concerns. It’s frustrating to encounter these issues repeatedly, and I’m considering exploring alternative food delivery options. In each food delivery, I have to spend more time on the support of the order than enjoying the food and delivery. Not acceptable and not recommended! | App said they sent me a message but I never received the SMS | I had to recently travel to Europe to study abroad and this app saved me! They deliver very late and it is always efficient. It is not very expensive and my food was always delivered in 15 minutes or less and still hot. Compared to food delivery here in America that is a Treasure! This app is awesome. | It’s terrible that they don’t have a plus for customers that order over 10’times a month like I do so we can’t get free delivery and pay monthly…support has no idea what they are doing as well as IT sector…this is specifically for Serbia and I’m done with this app | It’s all fun and games until you have a problem. I had a couple of issues  with restaurants not delivering items. Restaurants can’t send missing items so I had to attempt resolving issues with Wolt’s customer support. First the bot asks several questions in the span of 3-4 minutes each and then a person takes over, with even greater delays. In both of my cases they declined repeat delivery and offered credit for the missing items, which wasn’t satisfactory as they never reimbursed for the trouble. I regret getting food through Wolt.  I’ll know better next time. | Apple Pay intermittently works and credit cards are totally broken (as an American user sending food to friends in Europe) | I would expect a live activity on the lock screen from nothing but Wolt, it’s a necessary feature that’s missing for whatever reason 
Otherwise the app is extremely well done, I love it | jako jako losa usluga ponasanje im je krajnje ne profesionalno. | Dev team deserves a raise. Great looking app, easy and efficient to use. The haptics, widgets, animations, everything is top tier and beats the competition out of the water. The service itself along with the support team is also superb but kudos to the dev team | Customer support is subpar, with excessively long response times, absent manager communication, and an overall unsatisfactory service experience. | I placed an order, but it was canceled after 40 minutes, which resulted in a disappointing experience. | Incredibly negative experience with the extremely unprofessional and clueless customer support. 

After spending over 1000$ in the app in a two month period, when an order was not delivered to me, I was told there was “nothing they can do” because the courier said they delivered it. No offer of a refund, no offer to deliver the order again. Just a “too bad” you’re out 30$ with no food. 

I loved using Wolt but after this experience, I cancelled my pro account and have transitioned to a new delivery app. | if it’s available in your country, opt for Glovo or other courier services. every order is late 20 minutes minimum, and when you complain about it, the answers are slow, automated and quite unprofessional. You have to beg and check in three times with order support to merely *get* your order, and even then it’ll be 20 minutes minimum or more late than when you originally ordered it, and will come cold and hastily packed. The app was way better a year ago, now it’s a disaster | Occasionally they take the money without give us an order and they took the money and told us to text them in 3 days but after that they didn’t give us any solution and they stole the money so i don’t advise to pay and make an order from this app | In my 24 years of presence on this planet, never have I ever experienced such magnificent customer service as Wolt’s. 5 stars, no second thoughts. | შეკვეთის სისტემა აქ ძალიან ცუდი, თუ უკვეთავ ერთი რესტორნიდან 3 ერთიდაიგივე პროდუქტს სხვადასხვა შემადგენლობით ჯერ მარტო ერთი უნდა აირჩიო და მერე შეკვეთა უნდა დააკორექტირო და ამატო პროდუქცია, და ეს დამატების ინფორმაცია ღილაკადაც არ არი გამოტანილი ქვემოთ წერია წვრილი შრიფტით, ცუდი გამოცდილებით გავიგე ეგ დეტალი, ამ მხრივ გლოვო უფრო მარტივია და ფიდბექის კმაყოფილიც არ დავრჩი როდესაც ცხელ ხაზს ვესაუბრე | Ne koristite wolt uzasna aplikacija podrska ne odgovara poz | i ordered food waited more than 2 hours half of food came courier said that another part will be in 30 min then support not responding already 5 hours worst app ever i used stoled my money and no answers . | How an app can get worst instead of better? The logistic in it simply don’t work. Couriers go opposite direction. 10 min delivery become 40. The support has a bot that does not solve anything. | I travel the world for work and used many an app and in many a city. In a sea of poor packaging, disappointing portions and flavor,  Wolt in Ljubljana has been the absolute best so far. Delivery is better than predicted, restaurant choice is solid, taste and portion sizes are phenomenal. If you aren’t feeling up to venturing out, let Wolt help! You won’t be disappointed. | They are slow to deliver and their eta is never accurate.  Customer support is useless. Avoid | Невозможно зарегистрироваться, код не приходит ни на один из телефонов, ссылка на почту приходит битая. Попробуйте нормальных разработчиков нанять, вместо шимпанзе | I asked support to message restaurant to heat food a little bit more (from previous experience I know that it is not as hot as I like), but he ignored my request and said it's would be hot. As expected it came cold and support didn’t acknowledge that it was his fault. | The biggest bad app to deliver food try glovo its better 😂",4.84882,18362,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/10/e0/9d/10e09d7c-c5d0-9ba8-7255-1087620f7ed9/484659d5-ce13-4da3-a4d3-b072cd832974_CYP_Feb23_central-AppStoreCreatives_image_na_1242x2208_1_home.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/56/b4/db/56b4db8f-3d74-5caa-ad7b-6274d382a024/b4958c18-6fd7-4fdc-af0a-55f4703b2c05_CYP_Feb23_central-AppStoreCreatives_image_na_1242x2208_1_discovery.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/06/56/99/0656991c-992b-3493-498e-bd902e41c82d/130755fb-837b-4bbb-baa1-83236857c4fa_CYP_Feb23_central-AppStoreCreatives_image_na_1242x2208_1_restaurant.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f3/e1/e4/f3e1e4cf-3647-1075-074d-4a37accc9194/2ae2d2c8-d9be-469b-8680-f291d418917b_CYP_Feb23_central-AppStoreCreatives_image_na_1242x2208_1_foodcategories.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/94/92/5b/94925b6f-5cb1-e8f1-310e-44b34b5ab827/959484e1-664e-44be-a5be-760ffcb28478_CYP_Feb23_central-AppStoreCreatives_image_na_1242x2208_1_stores.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a7/4b/b8/a74bb8f3-a74b-7e76-feec-f022579d24d3/ac83f2ca-3b4b-4238-a41d-18d998d34b4f_CYP_Feb23_central-AppStoreCreatives_image_na_1242x2208_1_livetracking.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b9/ed/88/b9ed880d-5a28-119f-5eec-65d50c27027f/32053388-2314-4f4a-a1d3-75cacf60b49f_CYP_Feb23_central-AppStoreCreatives_image_na_1242x2208_1_support.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Self updating and functional apps are not beneath apple products, no one wants to update every single day. What is the problem…? Discrimination against old products again? Please update so camera can be of use. IpadOS17.2 | garbage | I love this app but I wish we could have more free storage space | Love it but I’m a producer and I wish there was a way to put the audio files on repeat, or to queue. | This is an amazing app that has been useful for my day to day life from school and homework files to work scheduling and also personal use. This app incorporates and helps organize Google Docs, Slides, Sheets and also PDF’s. Through this app I have become more proactive and more organized at my school and at home and at work. This app is an amazing tool and resource for anyone looking to organize and enhance their technological experiences. | Google drive is very excellent to allow sharing of larger file sizes or multiple files. It is very reliable and problem free | Templates | Works great always has | I can upload all my photos here and then delete them on my camera roll :) | This app is cool | I love using this Drive.  I can find all my special saves from emails, google, messages, and messenger. 

This is user friendly and easy to find what I am looking for.  

I love that I can share my important saves with my family and friends. | Good job | Demasiado | I have to execute two-step verification every time I access Google Drive on my smart phone. Then the app opens to a generic location and not the location where my hyperlink directed. Also, I can conveniently see the names of all the folders. Is that the date the folder was created or is that the date The latest file was placed in the folder? Whatever, it’s unnecessary at best and misleading at worst. | Always telling me video is still processing after several hours 😐 | Gran equipo de trabajo | Great way to save your files. | Me encanta la energía con la transmite su talento y sobretodo el conocimiento que tiene para ofrecer me encanta 🙌😁 | I don’t know if Google is doing it intentionally for Apple devices, but the app got so much slower and buggier recently. It takes about 30 SECONDS for the app to open a link (given it’s on high speed Wi-Fi network. Slower networks make it even longer).
Overall, using the website version is much quicker and easier at this point. A shame. | I’m trying to send a simple audio file to my phone and it won’t save just keeps reading error. Also if I press save on an audio file I text myself it does t do anything. | I like the app and now I will learn how to use it. Thanks | Floating buttons block the files 3 dots menu button. The “convenient” + and scan buttons are terribly inconvenient to me. They only work around I’ve found so far is to go through the steps of opening the document and then clicking on the menu button from inside the document.

Floating buttons usually block other elements of the UI. This is a design trend I really hope dies.

The + and scan buttons should really be part of the bottom bar if they are that important to have on display. | They literally let me accumulate photos in storage over 20 years and then one day started blocking me from accessing all of my photos and saved documents and put notices on my email account, my google photos, and my google drive saying that if I want my stuff back I have to pay to get it! That’s sooo messed up!! What a corrupt way to handle business! | Super easy to use! Easy to keep files together! | Google Drive is super easy to navigate! | No, I do not want to sign in to google account everywhere I go

Update: quit being evil | I do | There’s nothing that’s “blowing my mind” about Good Drive, but that’s what I love about it. 
I use multiple operating systems across many different devices in my line of work, and Drive is a consistent place to store and pull information as needed wherever I’m at or trying to do. 
Virtual organization is such a hassle for a lot of people, myself included. So I know how easily things can seem overwhelming and incredibly stressful having many types of Documents, Resumes, Presentations, Media, (and countless other things), coming in from work, as well as personal life. And this has been a great way for me to easily organize and access anything in the proper way, and most importantly I feel it’s secure, and you have many options on how you would like to share anything you may have. It’s worth getting, and also worth the extra effort in making the switch from a current app or system you use to Google Drive. It’s consistent, the prices are fair and reasonable, and any “surprise” I have come across has been positive. Am still discovering new and possible things I am able to do on here. Keep up the great work, it’s appreciated! | Drive is my go to file storage and sharing app on iOS devices and my Windows lap top. | Muy buena aplicación no da fallo | Doesn’t work well enough to be considered usable on IOS. Can’t select multiple files at once, most I the time newly uploaded files aren’t there for hours, downloads are slow. At least pretend you don’t make your app unusable for competing operating systems | This is a great little app, access to external storage on the go.  I’d only like to see a feature make music play in a friendlier format like adding repeat or make a playlist but it’s still a very good app. | I didn’t even know these are here !
I’m so glad they’re safe here
Sincerely, Monique | This app used to be great, now it barely ever loads the files, it stays in a perpetual spin. Before this it was 5 stars, now it's virtually unusable. Good luck finding support. | Great for my schooling | Tarda mucho en procesar videos cortos de 1 min ó menos de 100 MB, porqué ??? En Amazon Drive y otros es en minutos y aqui tarda varios días, la verdad no es una solución así, estaría bién arreglar eso | This used to be perfect. The best storage system by far. I use it for everything. Now it just loads forever. It’s a useless app on my phone. I have to use the web site on my phone browser. I might start looking for another solution. I don’t have time to fight an app that I need to just work

Edit: at the developer advice, I deleted and reinstalled the app. It’s still slow but working for now. | I can watch T&H lessons | Stop asking for revision I do one thing nice  and you start blocking my opening of my photos.  
                    I don’t have time for this.
                     Please Stop | It is a great app | Seems weird | This is one of the worst thing I have ever downloaded prosessing videos takes forever! | Don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this Google update?  Linkage is certainly not clear! | Très bien | iPhone 15 pro max. Doesn’t load files. 12 year user on android with no major problems. Made the switch and now this…death spin, the google way | it drains the battery even when I don't open the app and have background app refresh disabled for it | User interface is not graphically appealing as other similar functions | Love how google drive is designed and dependable. | Very disappointed with the complexity of something that should be easily accessible to everyone to navigate!

Simply the worst and then had to pay for full Zoom version which did everything! Do not spend money on App!!!!!! | Horrible features. SLACK IS THE BEST.
Multiple useless chats from meetings, no control for status change, basically there are no settings that one can use to customise. U can see urself or others if presenting. Learn from Zoom and slack. And work! Lazy team | Using iOS 17.3.1, when I have been in a meeting viewing another attendees screen, normally I can make a quick swipe up movement to review something in another app, with the teams view becoming a small landscape window on top of the other apps in a portrait view oriented screen. it used to be that when I went back to tapping the arrows to make teams full screen again, I could shipped back from that micro view in portrait orientation to fullscreen landscape view. That is no longer working since an unknown change a couple of weeks ago. Tapping those a little arrows allows me to block out everything else on the screen, but the focus on content image view is still miniature and only available in portrait orientation. It does not improve if I change from focus on content to another view; it is fixed temporarily, at least, if I quit the meeting and rejoin. I don't know what who did--whether the problematic update was for Microsoft from Apple --but they busted it. and since I haven't noticed this problem with any other app, I'm suspecting it was Microsoft. | So good | You really have to make a concerted effort to be this bad at application design. Well done! | MICROSOFT FIX YOUR GODDAMN APP ASAP. IT NO LONGER LAUNCHES AND IS STUCK ON THE TEAMS LOGO. IM UPDATED TO THE LATEST IOS AND IVE DELETED CACHE, OFFLOADED, RESTARTED, AND DELETED AND REINSTALLED. I CAN STILL ACCESS THE TEAMS APP ON MY LINUX COMPUTER SO IT IS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SOFTWARE. | Cannot pivot back and forth from to copy and paste meeting ID and passcode | For some reason I can’t explain, I constantly receive calls from fax machines that, by design, try over and over to connect until they send their message. I used to be able to block these phone numbers by clicking on the info icon and choosing “block caller” from the menu. That feature no longer appears in the menu, so now I am forced to either delete the app (which I need for work) or deal with 10-20 calls in a row from these persistent fax machines. Very frustrating. | It’s very good and suitable for online classes | With the new update the notifications (“red flags”,for lack of a better, showing the number of messages unread) keep reappearing. You’d read the messages / open the app, yet after a while the red flag would reappear. It’s super annoying (especially in after hours) as you’d think that you missed a message, but in reality the app is incorrectly showing old / read message as unread. Please fix asap. | It is one of the best tools for communicating with my colleagues, it allows us to stay in touch with each other almost instantaneously. Please keep coming with the innovations. | Anytime I get a Teams notification, teams decides to add a couple more numbers to the notification count. And the only way to make them go away is to open and close the app. It’s extremely frustrating. It looks like there are at least 3 notifications all day long. But then I open the app and close it and there are zero. But as soon as another chat comes in, it goes right back up to 3. | It kicked me and my friends out and now I can not sign back in! | Would be nice to be able to choose the alert sound on the iPhone.  It uses a default sound that is the same as other apps that I’ve been critical of also. | For some reason, typing anything in this app is the slowest, most frustrating experience, with a solid 3 second lag between a keypress and a character appearing in a text box. The inability to bulk upload or download photos and files (and inability to download certain files even one at a time) kneecaps the usability. | I have notifications turned on for Teams. All options: badge, sounds, Lock Screen. With the update 6 days ago, the badges will say something like “23,” despite my sitting at my laptop and having read and responded to everything. I open the iPhone app and there is nothing unread. I’ll filter for unread, there is nothing. I close the app and notifications remain. I’ve force closed, turned off notifications , turned them on again - no fixes. | Doesn’t send notifications when you want them. Sends notifications to your phone while you’re using the desktop app (with “block notifications when active on other devices” enabled). Sometimes I’ll receive a notification, but then have to wait minutes for the actual message to be visible in the chat (likely related to Microsoft’s constant infrastructure problems). | The iPadOS version is fantastic! | Serious lag when typing on iPhone 12 Pro Max.

Hating to use the teams app. | This app is great for collaborating and housing everything in one place. If possible, can we incorporate the gifs in the mobile app? My company has it locked down to where we can’t use outside apps for security protocols. Adding this would be amazing. | Status icon is not working when opening the app. Please fix this. | Teams has worked fine until the last update. Now, no matter what settings I have on my iPhone or Teams, I no longer receive sound or banner notifications…. | Not a fan of this app! Since the last update this app doesn’t work and remains stuck… … … … … | Great.  Frees up my time | The app breaks the ability to join meetings if you refuse to give permission to scan devices on your local network. This setting has nothing to do with connecting to the internet, and isn’t necessary for my use of the app. Unfortunate that they chose to prevent me from joining meetings unless I give them the ability to harvest information about my local network. I have deleted the app. | Since there’s not a way to report this. There’s a broken MFA loop with Microsoft authenticator. Never corrects, just ends up in a sign in loop. Would have reported if there was a bug button in the app or even on the help page. But here we are. | حيوان كلب زق كريه يارب الي سواه يتطلق | Very user friendly. Great app. | Blurry profile pictures not really feeling it | 手机怎么也登录不了 电脑可以正常使用 希望可以解决这个问题 | Can’t join meeting, acts like codes are invalid. Had to use browser on my laptop instead. Not convenient. | This app worked great, just like the computer app, until our IT switched to Microsoft Teams New on our PCs… now this app is pretty much pointless. I don’t understand! | This app used to be way better than texting, since some update about a year ago it’s absolutely terrible. The amount of times I have to close and open the app just to get messages to load is unreal. My company is switching to a different messaging app because of how bad it’s become. Went from hero to zero due to zero. Works fine on computer, but both my iPhone and Galaxy have non stop issues with the app. | I’ve been waiting for Microsoft Intune and authenticator support to use this application on my Apple vision, Pro company, resources, and personal devices and access it are managed and i use the Microsoft 365 suite on the Apple Vision Pro. Please fix this. | Great App, keeps you connected. Easy to use. Lots of tools to improve performance and communication effectiveness | It already happened twice this week while using Teams and Google Maps and also with Waze on CarPlay background. Made me loose an important exit 😅 | It’s got to be one of the least pleasant notification sounds I have ever heard. Side note - definitely came in handy once or twice when working crazy hours and I fell asleep on my desk. But outside of that BOOOOOOOOOOOO | Zoom offers a variety of features that have contributed to its popularity as a video-conferencing tool. Some of the key features include:
Virtual Backgrounds: Allows users to change their background to an image or video during a call.
Keyboard Shortcuts: Provides various shortcuts for actions like muting, starting video, recording, etc.
App Integration: Enables connection with other apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, Slack, etc., for easy scheduling and joining of meetings.
Breakout Rooms: Permits the host to split the meeting into smaller groups for focused discussions.
Polls and Surveys: Facilitates the creation and launching of polls and surveys during meetings for interactive feedback.
Screen Sharing: Allows sharing of the screen or a specific window with participants.
Chat and Reactions: Offers chat messaging and the use of emojis and gestures for reactions.

But I’m sure that these things will be integrated in a better capacity. I’m liking it so far I’m using it for work and it has been beneficial. Nice going Microsoft. I had lost my faith in you, but you guys are slowly what surely regaining it to see greater integration in Windows 12. | Allows our organization to communicate effectively between departments so everyone gets vital updates | Teams is still useless to a large number of users (educational and large business) because you still won’t add managed user access….. parity with the iPad version should be a requirement, especially this far in.  Please fix or release the iPad version. | 1) when using an external screen and iPad in landscape the video is rotated incorrectly 2) no external usb webcam support 3) no Apple Watch audio only calls | This app used to be mediocre. Now it’s unusable. Calendar does not enable you to look beyond one week! Unless you’re accustomed to not planning ahead, find other apps. | O don’t get any notifications on my phone now. I need to open and check the app manually. Very disappointed | This software requires permissions to run that are not technically required for the software to operate, and even when they are granted fails at its basic operations. | The notification badge is broken and always shows phantom notifications (ie - it says 32 when I receive a single chat message). Very irritating. | Not sure what’s going on lately but the notifications on this app are terrible. I get one ping and it shows 35 in the app icon badge and it doesn’t go away when I view on computer. So annoying | The rest of the app is pretty good but the useless badging drives me nuts. It constantly shows some number, but when I open the app there actually are zero new notifications. | For the vast majority of corporate users, Teams won’t work on Vision Pro until Microsoft does the very trivial work of bringing over InTune to support MDM authentication and login.

Apple did the work to support MDM on AVP in version 1.1, now it’s all waiting on Microsoft. They could just check the box to allow us to use the iPad version of InTune, but so far they haven’t. Knowing Microsoft, it will be 2026 before this happens. Until then, all of the Office apps are just placeholders — not useable by the vast majority of Microsoft customers, and just window dressing for Apple’s launch.

Save everyone the pain of unplugging their phone to do it in the app!!! | Everytime I open the app my “mood” character is different. I do not log out and it’s been happening for a few weeks.

Boy band was funny, kept you awake and alert while driving. Please! | Decent app, used to like it before 12 cracked it. Do not use waze in atlanta GA you will regret it. | WAZE can no longer be trusted. Google made sure of that. An update is supposed to improve not hinder the operation of the app … which Google has failed to comprehend or ...   Google Maps have been wrong more than they have been right in my experience. WAZE NEVER took me down a narrow road that led to a dead end in the middle of nowhere! That’s why I got WAZE. And in my honest opinion that was probably why the WAZE program was written, because Google couldn’t deliver.  And they don’t like fun!! All the avatars are gone! How can it be real time time if can’t report safely? Google is purposely killing WAZE in my opinion by making it harder to report safely as in ‘use the app as intended’ by requiring more time and ATTENTION to operate therefore rendering the original intent of the app useless. JMHO 😢 | I like a lot of things about this app however I hate at the same time and end up not using cause if the phone is connected to my car once I add the address it doesn’t give me options to see routes available it just starts the navigation straight away and if I want to see the route I need to disconnect the phone while I am lost and driving and it’s very annoying, on the top off that when I disconnect from the car and  stop the navigation to see the route it immediately erase the address and I have to type all again or reselect the address that sometimes save on history sometimes not… once again all that nightmare while I am driving!! It would be a better app if it would do like google does! | I like that Waze updates me on police officers and some traffic patterns. But it is extremely dangerous. It changes your patterns while driving shaving one minute off is not really doing me any help and pulling me through 300 additional stops again is not a fair option to choose from

Now, when ask me to change Rt, I had to do it on my car screen instead of my phone, which is even more dangerous and I can’t figure out the Rt pattern.

I wish there was an option to stop getting routed through neighborhoods. I don’t want 368. Turns the mental stress and load of that is 10 times worse than just sitting on the highway. For example, no way routing me through downtown Atlanta was better than keeping me on 285 and taking me straight to Smyrna.. Grammatical errors using voice to text | Traveling from Louisiana to Washington, got to the border of New Mexico and Colorado in Raton, when we pulled off to get food. We were traveling north with no issues. Tried to get back on the road and Waze directed us to start traveling south. I noticed pretty fast since all the signs said South I-25, and we turned around, but Waze continued to say we needed to make a uturn and head south. Our eta changed from 8:20pm before the stop to 10pm after. Since it kept telling us to do a compete 180°, I decided to pull up Apple Maps to get directions and when I did it put us on the correct route with the eta being 8:33. So not only was it the complete wrong way and had us backtracking, it wouldn’t have even got us there faster but 1 and 1/2 hours later. This app is defunked if it can’t give the right directions, especially if other apps have the same reporting features as this one now. | Been using App for years; had many destinations saved, routes, drives, narrator voices; now, suddenly, with no warning, for no reason, all that info is gone, and I have to start over like the first day!
So disappointed! | Waze has helped me avoid traffic numerous times, but whenever I can’t avoid it, I add time to my ETA. The app always underestimates how much time you will spend in traffic. | 𝕀𝕥'𝕤 𝕛𝕦𝕤𝕥 𝕘𝕠𝕠𝕕 𝕞𝕪 𝕗𝕣𝕚𝕖𝕟𝕕𝕤 𝕒𝕝𝕤𝕠 𝕝𝕠𝕧𝕖 𝕚𝕥 ♡❥❢♥︎ᜊ | It’s so bad | I use the Waze app while traveling for business but my major issue is that it doesn’t give you a heads up as to what’s coming… for example, it would be helpful if the app was able to say “at the night light take a right” OR when I’m about to take and exit let me know what lane to be in before I actually exit, something like “exit right and stay in the left lane” this way I don’t exit right and it’s a split exit with 2 routes to go and I got in the wrong lane which has happened.

I know the screen shows it but what if you can’t look at the screen because it’s heavy traffic? 

Just a recommendation. | Waze is one of those rare apps that i will go out of my way to write a review for. This app has saved from about 35 speeding tickets at this point and it’s the first thing i throw on when i drive. The routes are always efficient and the traffic data seems to be almost as accurate as google maps! I would say the only downside is the battery draw on your phone but if you have a charger and are using carplay, there is nothing to complain about. Would love to be able to mark hazards for other wazers from the other side of the road though! | The “where to” disappears too quick when opening the app. | This app was awesome before the last update. The voice alerts for speed traps and red light cameras was great. Since the update, this feature is no longer available. Also, the app accesses your location even when you’re not using it. Please change everything back to how it was before this AWFUL update. | Waze stays open on my phone after I leave my car for some reason. I have to open it then close it to exit the app. If not caught it will drain battery | I have used Waze for years but finally had to delete this app because it requires location tracking to be enable and actually running at all times.   The only workaround is to disable location services whenever the app is not being used.   Its a shame because its otherwise a great app. | Had iPhone 7, worked great with CarPlay. Was a 5 star app. Upgraded to iPhone 15. Can’t report hazards, hazards aren’t announced, can’t get directions, it’s totally useless now. I’ve tried uninstalling it, reinstalling it. Forgetting device on CarPlay, etc. can’t find information on user forums. | I enjoy the accuracy of the app I only wish that when you are arriving at your location, it will actually show the address and a picture of the location. For example, your destination is on the left or the right it literally just drops a pin in the middle of the block and it doesn’t show you that you’ve arrived at said address it just tells you you’ve arrived, there is no picture there is no address of which you put in. I use Waze a lot with Uber and it never gives me the final destination. I always have to switch over to Uber to see where the house is. | Fix this asap. | Apple Car Play - Intermittent operation tried everything still working intermittently….. | Actualice mi IOS y simplemente no lo he podido usar me no muestra el kilometraje pido direccion pero se vuelve loco y me lleva a otra ubicacion. Si voy por una calle me muestra q voy por otra. Asi q ya no la uso | Unable to find gps coordinates | The new update basically accused me of lying about my age and showed jokes like “wow a 2 year old driving a car!”! I don’t recall ever being asked to set it. But even if I set it wrong, being rude is not okat | I love this app 1 of the best I done download to navigate ❤️ | Waze used to be good. It would direct people around traffic via back roads, finding better routes for all. But now so many go down back roads that it just clogs everything up, and Waze doesn’t recognize how bad they are. Waze sent  us to backroads for a merge, insisting it would get us there quicker, just a few minutes of traffic this way.

We’ve been sitting in this traffic an hour, barely moving, debating a much longer route but no, Waze insisted we press on, that it was about to get better. It has not. Waze’s predictions are useless. | Sound no longer working, did all basic troubleshooting, reinstalled the app and updated to iOS 16.7 with no luck. | I used to love this app.  Best gps out there, for a little while.  Seems to me anymore that people just place hazards for the fun of it.  I’ve seen countless times where I would say something was no longer there, and the pin remains.  Especially when it’s police.  And how in the world do you get rid of the stupid elf voice??? Even when I check all notifications and setting, somehow that dude still speaks to me.  It’s like nails on a chalkboard. | Waze now cannot even navigate to contacts in the phone, making it a pain to use if intending to use it as a GPS (the very thing it’s meant for).
Routing no longer allows simple reporting of street closures, so instead circles you back to try to force impossible turns.

It even tries to route you to things on the other side of a bay (Seattle area) rather than ones nearly to include ones along the current route. This is made worse since technically something being 16 miles away (but across the bay, so requiring about an hour to get to), shouldn’t be shown in lue of locations about 3 miles away.

It still has the benefit of fun voice options, and viewing other users on the map.p | Such a cute app it helps me get places quickly and gives me the best routes tells me if there’s an accident or any slow traffic. The kiddos entertain on car rides just watching little Waze characters. and have some low battery draining, but just keep it plugged in and you’ll be good. This is a very good family map app and I definitely recommend it to every person young or old. | Waze used to be very accurate for commute times. Now it seems to consistently give optimistic estimations. I’d vastly prefer a realistic take than something that tends to get me there in 20-50% more time than it said it would. | I love this app it’s got good stuff but I wood suggest to put wiring Like there is cameras on the lights so that the person that is behind would respect if not then they should be a police man giving tickets | Constantly puts be in the wrong lane trying to avoid traffic in the dmv are. Ends up making me later than if I had just gone through traffic. | Waze, I like your map. I use all the time. I noticed that the speed limit is not showing while using Apple car play. Can you please correct this issue? I would be awe so grateful. Thank you😁 | Love this app! Would love to see a school icon because think of how many people use this app driving their kids to school. Thanks! | I got Waze a little over 4 years ago and have been using it ever since. I personally find this app easier to use and read than other GPS apps. I love this app for many reasons but let’s be real, the real reason is having Master Chief as my GPS voice. I hope they never stop having Master Chief as a voice option, it’s just too perfect! | Works incredibly well in open spaces, but where I live in Boston, it is remarkably frustrating because under the tunnels, it will lose reception. Also, when looking for larger areas, it will use the map directions, but it won’t use the directions as to where a person can actually drive into the complex or area.it has lost me multiple times with regards to larger parks or golf courses where it will bring me to the course, but not to the actual entrance of the course so I am driving around aimlessly looking for where I can enter. | It has a lot to improve its keep giving long ways and most stupid routes even tho i do not accept change in the route it keeps taking me the way it wants | Why does my Waze suddenly start speaking to me in another language? I can’t tell if it’s Greek or Spanish.  
I do love the colors of the map on the new update however. | Has been the best, most useful, and easiest to use navigation app available. Lately, however, it has become very buggy. It seems to have started when they were bought out by Google. Perhaps they are just getting rid of the competition by abandoning it, because it has problems running on Apple Car Play. 1/2 of the time the map shows, but won’t show a route, you can’t interact with it on the car’s touch screen display, and it won’t go into dark mode. Sometimes it’s just a blank screen until you shut the car off and restart it. I don’t want to use Google Maps or even Apple Maps, but often, I don’t have a choice because Waze won’t work. Update: Just as soon as it started working again, they updated and totally ruined the app. Don't know why developers destroy apps with updates that completely change it. With this update, they have pretty much eliminated users reporting incidents, police, objects on road, etc. Because now, instead of two screen taps to report, it now takes at least three and sometimes four. which is not safe to do while driving. I'm not reporting anymore because they have made it more time consuming and cumbersome. I know many users will also stop because of this, which eliminates the feature that set Waze apart from Google or Apple maps.
They also got rid of the on screen speed limit signs, which is another negative change making the app not worth using anymore. | Has not been working since updating to ios17 | Mostly useful for looking at real time traffic conditions and routes  around them well. 

Comes up short on logical routes in denser areas, routing into heavy traffic vs around it. 

Use as a reference but also review routes and make own judgement calls. | The new update makes it extremely difficult to find saved destinations.  It also don’t show my calendar appointments and desertions anymore. The app version is the current update located on Apple Store and my iPhone is running iOS version 17.4. 

The new App update also won’t give in-app access to Amazon Music anymore. It only allows Apple Music. Before update I was able to chose Amazon Music as my Waze in-app Music. The update removed it and now I can’t choose. | Since update I cannot get Waze into dark mode during the day like I used to be able to do. Yes my cell is selected dark mode on the cell. Connect to the car screen goes in light mode. Thermos NO selections in setup on the car navigation screen or anywhere else in car setup to go to dark screen. This only happened after update. I uninstalled Waze re download Waze fresh reinstall. Connected and same results. What is weird is on my my wife’s car screen she also couldn’t go into dark mode. Was like this for several days or weeks then all of a sudden while she was driving in the day time Waze switched to dark mode. We both have the same make of vehicles hers 23 camera, me Tacoma 22. I don’t understand how hers finally all by it self went into dark mode as she and I both prefer. I’m giving it a few more days and if Waze doesn’t change will be deleted. | Not by tap shows alternative route as used to be 
Once click that  only one route ! Pleaee fix this 
Used to show local and fast   So pleaee fix this thanks | I gave this app one star and here’s why. I’ve used Waze for years and for a long time it was invaluable to me. I drive a lot and I mean a lot for work in city traffic and up until recently Waze had an option where you could see alternative routes while you were already navigating. This was what made Waze really work for me. Driving in a city there are multiple ways you can go. Waze will always send you the shortest time route. But sometimes that route makes you cross over four lanes of traffic without a stoplight and other things like that. So when I can search other ways to go, sometimes it is worth one extra minute for my safety or less stress, but I can no longer do that because Waze took away that ability. Until they put it back as someone who drives all the time it doesn’t work for me anymore. I am very disappointed.

Awkward to use, and very limited in what it can do. | I like this app so much it has great use for work. | No, I do not want to sign in to google account everywhere I go

Update: quit being evil | 난 너무 행복합니다 | Grew up on excel and continue to think that way. Sheets is a decent free app! | Our HOA keeps tracks of dues payments, equipment logs, and maintenance schedules. All of our board members have access to these very important sheets and are able to update them in real time. Google sheets is a solution for everybody. | I don’t know if it’s iPad or Sheets: When accessing sheets via my iPad it barely works. Many functions don’t work at all, some very slow. | Sheets is the most time consuming tedious eye squinting frustrating invention which gives people who swear by it a false sense of security that those who are proficient or better at it are actually good in their job roles. Just because someone can scramble an egg does not make them a cook or a chef. | I just updated the app and now the sheet I was working on has disappeared. | Not every function is on the app compared to the computer version and that is annoying and frustrating!! All functions should be available, otherwise it's not as useful. Can't even delete a row or column or make checkboxes in the app. | Thank you that is so helpful | Poor knock off of Excel. | I hadn’t posted since 2022, and found a mystery post.🥲🤔🤨Wondering how this could happen 🤷‍♀️; and if I could trust it to post further information? | It is so easy to use and love being able to share between all my devices | Google sheet’s stopped importing stock prices into google sheets about a week ago. I cannot figure out how to correct this. | Doesn’t do anything and won’t let me sign out of my account to change it to another. Hate it | So great for on the go organizing and planning. I would like to see more tools made easier to access in the mobile version, or perhaps just made more intuitive. Otherwise, it’s a trusty staple for someone who’s always organizing multiple projects at once. 4/5 | I just love sheets it’s so useful for my daily life | It is simply just another useful tool that only Google provides that is just very organized and simple, there is nothing that can top it off and there is no reason to, it simply is just there, always there when you need it. Just like Docs and Slides, so many uses and so easy to edit. Google Sheets is just overall useful. | So hard to use. Where is the currency button? Can’t drag down cells to copy automatically. Can’t recognize patterns when trying to drag two cells. | Helpful for RSVP list.  Maureen | Awesome tool | Google wants you to use the app instead because they won’t allow you to use the browser version. The app won’t even let you split screen view. | Years of trying to improve time management skills has finally become obvious to me at least this is the place that integrates with EVERYTHING & EVERYONE!

If wasn't even weeks ago that CRM’s. Portals, CMS’s, Industry developed apps for efficiency were being developed & still be developed sold & used.

With some exceptions of course to be realistic & totally truthful Google Workspace along with all the other complimentary apps, tools, assets, attributes, Beta Testing, accommodations, schedulng, tracking using all the strictest business best practices of course is obvious to me that everything that any person or AI computer can think of realistic or not is already being used by those who see this is the future now. | It working beautiful for me | I use sheets to track my work outs. Every day sheets bugs out. When I lock my phone and open back to the app a lot of the time when I go to select a cell it will select one like 3 of 4 cells down. Won’t unbug until I close the app. Really annoying. | Love that I can use on all my devices and very similar to excel. I also love that it’s free, really free not fake news free, lol! But my only negative is you can’t add images, and if you can I can not figure out how. This is great software but not as intuitive as excel, though it has many similarities.

Update: It’s been glitchy adding formulas (they are erroring out,  formula is correct and worked in some cells and not in others) and with data sort drop down is glitching looks like background coding issue giving random symbols and sporadic letters and numbers but only in some cells, other data sorts are working this is all within the same spreadsheet. | App doesn’t allow you to set the number of decimal places after you have formatted the cells to numeric | Horrible, hard to use on phone. Not intuitive or user friendly. | You can’t up load to zoom there is no 
Limit no tap zoom
Email
Or any thing 
It’s not easy to up load sorting a meeting 
And share | برنامج جيد | Muy buena herramienta para hacer mis tablas | Please add the option to remove duplicates. It is not on the mobile app but on the computer version. | I use Google Sheets and post them in a Google website where students can check them and see weekly updates.  The data on the worksheets have links to websites. Win Win for everyone. | Más fácil que excel | Love this app | User friendly. | Amazing service | I really enjoy using it in my note taking .It helps organize my business and personal matters in an order I can then share with my family as needed. | it’s pretty good i guess but i wonder why i can’t format spreadsheets :/ i just want to easily make the rows alternating colors…. | I use Google Sheets every day, and every day I force quit the app 3-5 times because of inexplicable glitches and bugs. That has remained constant across the past year, through many app updates and versions. If it were a random app from a small developer, I would chalk it up to normal cost of doing business, but this is Alphabet—if any company on earth should solve bugs, it is them.

About 10% of the time when open a sheet, I see no fields populated, only highlighted colors. I have to force quit the app and reload to see the data. Most frequently, there are glitches when you try to toggle quickly between editing multiple fields. I often cannot edit a field after selecting it, or close the editor after entering data. In both cases, I have to force quit and reload the app.

Again, it’s a powerful and useful app, but it feels like freeware somebody made in their garage, not a mainstay Google product. After so long, these should be high-priority fixes. | I tried to put a simple math formula =(2+5)/(8+3) and it wouldn’t appear. Restarted the app then now the app will crash everytime i try to open that sheet. Terrible | Sheet still needs a lot of work | Very simple and can use from anywhere | I have basic requirements so I've not used many of the available features. But I have no complaints whatsoever. I like being able to access my Google Sheets from whatever device I happen to be using and from any of my business travel destinations. | Very good | Great | it works okay.

	I was using it for a school project and it was difficult to use but, not terrible.  The typing method is weird because you type in a small box at the bottom of the screen but, your text shows up where ever you want. The boxes are annoying and finicky and copying can be challenging.

And they wany 6 stat | Netflix was great until recently. Now, only a few people can watch Netflix on one account at a time, and adds interrupt the show even though we pay for it. I would not recommend Netflix for big families and people who can go watch TV elsewhere for free with adds. | Tap to expand and fill the screen with the image needs improvement. iPhone and AppleTv. | Just spent about a half hour trying to log in with my iPad. After trying everything listed on their support page it’s still a no go. I suspect this app is buggy. Will cancel subscription if this continues. | Netflix why are the thundermans on adult it’s made for kids and adults | Screw you Netflix for making this policy. This is such a blatantly selfish move on your part. Not every family can afford for every kid to pay for their own account. Now myself and other siblings in college can’t afford to watch shows we’d like to watch. Your service has increasingly gotten worse over the years and this just puts the cherry on top. I sincerely hope you go under. Thanks for nothing. | After using this for years with my family, this new policy has messed it all up. My family and I travel all the time, now if we want to watch something we have to verify. This is an extreme inconvenience especially that the one who is paying for the account and is the one who receives the emails cannot constantly go verify due to old age and health conditions. Thus, prevents people a part of the household to not br able to watch Netflix when we are away. Additionally, it says we have to verify when in the household and connected to the wifi. This is a big problem because nobody can watch anything in the house. Hope this gets taken away soon because a lot of customers are unsubscribing after a long time because of this extreme inconvenience. According to an article, you guys have lost nearly 1 billion dollars due to former subscribers unsubscribing because this of absurd policy | Yesterday, I created a Netflix account and subscribed. However, this morning, I was logged out, and each time I attempt to log in, it keeps stating ""incorrect password."" Despite trying to change my password, I encounter an error message. Could you please clarify this issue? | It doesn’t make sense to me why the netflix app doesn’t have the date/year that each season for a series got released. it shows when the series was initially released, sure, but 10 seasons later, it would be very convenient to see when season 7 was released instead of having to search it on the web. | What I mean by bring back the seasons is that when you guys updated Netflix you guys took away seasons on my little pony for example, there are used to be all the seasons, but then you guys took away season five season six season seven season eight season nine it was not right for me, so technically what I’m trying to say that you should add all the seasons from every single movie or every single shout back because it does not feel right for me just watching season one season two season three and season for over and over. It does not stand right for me so please bring back all the seasons for every single show. Thank you for your time. | On my ipad, from my house:
- I can login to to the website no problems.
- Signing out and logging back into the app still give me the message that not part of household and watch temporarily. And I tried deleted the app and reinstalling. Same problem.

That’s just stupid. | If your paying a monthly subscription for a service you should have access to the service considering this has been standard since netflix has been a subscription streaming service. Disloyal to the customer because they want you to buy more subs to watch if your not apart of the so called “household”
which is just another way to restrict people and make more money
of course its a terrible feature. Remove it. Wake up samurai we have a netflix to protest. | I love Netflix but I would love if they put all the movies of twilight on Netflix in and I will be so happy | the animes on the app are amazing and iconic, but can we add some more? especially dragon ball z, gt, super and the movies 🙏 | Your greed and new plan packages are ruining you platform. You came about to be better than cable, now you’re exactly the same. 

I wish there would be a mass cancellation of accounts and your company would tank. | You should combined kid to adults to together so more people can watch more things it not fair grownups can watch the other stuff like put avengers on kids channels and other stuff more opportunities to watch it’s not fair if kids watch cartoon movies all day have more action movies | The people that are giving this one star are people that can’t work with technology. It’s not Netflix fault. It’s just the people that are too slow and lazy to figure anything out. | Honestly, I am very disappointed, as multiple people can no longer share one account without being connected to the household wifi, or paying. This just means we have to spend more money on more accounts. | Pip doesn’t work anymore, also whoever canceled 1899 should be fired. | BBG PLEASE PUT COUNTDOWN ON NEXFLIT PLEASE MY POOKIE WOOKIE HONBUN SUGAR CUPCAKE PRINCESS CUTIE PATOOTIE | Its a harmful and greedy policy to a bunch people (low income families the most) I hope Netflix’s profits plummet and they get bought and picked apart by companies who know better than to screw their customers. :) | My parents pay for me to have netflix but now i cant even use the netflix for me because “its not in the household” this company is money hungry and very unprofessional do not spend your money on them they dont have any good shows anyways | I thought i loved Netflix but It’s a terrible service. Imagine watching a show with 3 seasons with only 2 available. Or a movie trilogy where the first is missing. Or the fact that there are some titles where they just show the last movie. I wouldn’t recommend this for anyone who loves movies and shows. I love watching everything but if its 1 thing i cant stand is watching a show with missing episodes or missing movies in a series. | I get it, some peeps share their Netflix password and Netflix has ‘ideas’ how to cut that. But those ideas SCREW UP THE EXPERIENCE for the ‘good actors’, peeps who have multiple devices in the same household. …. It throws you out of your account and you have to periodically tell Netflix that it’s still you - the one who’s been paying their salaries through membership for many years. wow - what a screwup. 

Deleting that app, canceling my subscription - don’t have time for Netflix’s anti-password share greed activities. 

Bye. Hello Disney, Amazon and Apple TV.

(Should be 1-star, but content is good, so 2-stars). | These is dose not have anything to do with the app but netflix i need all the inuyasha season's | Netflix is good but you can’t used it in other locations and they added adds now. It is like they only care about the money | So I tried to watch Netflix on my phone and for some reason I couldn’t get into my account. It said I had to put in the password so I did and it did not work. | It’s probs the best app for movies and shows etc. :DDDD | netflix is scamming at this point. high prices, low quality content, household policy. just switch | Hello, 

Just letting your company know what is happening with some accounts with the new Household and WiFi network restrictions. I saw that I couldn’t access my account anymore on my WiFi at my new apartment, so I was disappointed. I know my dad uses it at his house, but I also don’t want to pay more a month to watch the content. Luckily I have AppleTV, Prime video and Hulu to choose from after that! Bummer that I can’t watch Netflix anymore but at least I have those! Just went right to Amazon Prime after that. | Netflix can u PLEASE PUT SEASON1 AND 2 BACK UP LIKE PLEASE THATS MY FAV SHOW AND UR MAKING MY LIFE MISERABLE | With as much money as we’re spending on this app you would think we would be getting our moneys worth instead the app logs me out and says my device is not apart of the Netflix household even though the app has been downloaded on my tablet for years. And yes it’s been updated, yes the password and username are correct, yes the bill has been paid, and no it’s not my device. Fix it. | Netflix works great, problem is the dominos game was working now states “an error has occurred please try again later sorry for the inconvenience” 

Please fix the problem. 

Thank you. | It’s good but can you please add be the cartoon grinch,coraline, and all of the monster high tv shows/short movies | This app and company have been going downhill for a long time, but I've hit my breaking point. The app layout CONSTANTLY changes. None of these changes are ever necessary, and they make the app worse and harder to use. Not to mention that Netflix as a company keeps making worse and worse shows and movies, and cancel the rare good ones that they manage to squeeze out. But I kept it, because my family still used it on occasion. Today I opened the app for the once-in-a-blue-moon that I ever open Netflix, only for the app to tell me I'm ""not a part"" of MY OWN HOUSEHOLD. The only reason that had been left to use Netflix is that multiple people can share an account, but with the sheer audacity of them to charge an arm and a leg for ONE account, banning password sharing WITHIN A HOUSEHOLD is the last straw. I'd give negative stars if I could for this unusable app and scummy company. Your money is better spent elsewhere. | What is the point of even having the app is I can’t watch anywhere other than home? Netflix has gone down the drain in recent years and I will be cancelling my membership. It’s no longer worth spending money on and I will be moving to a different streaming platform. | Signed out of ALL devices from the website. Logged into 2 devices I use . The 3rd (my iPhone) gives the error message the device is not part of house hold , but only have 2/4 devices signed in per the website . HHHHHHOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!?!?!?! And yes I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Same message!!!! | no me aparece nana😔 | These ads are straight unreal and ridiculous. For YEARS there has been no ads and now you guys put ads? Take them off before you lose more money. | La pollo | Can’t log in “password is wrong” (same password 8 years now works on the tv)
Can’t reset password “error email not found “ (same email address as always triple checked tried on several different days) | Won’t allow me to watch in my own home, it should be illegal. Cancelling all subscriptions with them, never use Netflix they’re bloody thieves | The new update is ok but I can’t find anything now and half of the stuff from continue watching is gone. Also, basically all of the anime I have been watching the past few years is gone and know I am basically left with none of my old shows.😭😭😭💀☠️ | the new household is stupid, canˋt watch anything if im not on my house is annoying and stupid. | I’ve always watched Netflix on my phone rather then my tv or computer, so as of recently I now have to get a temporary code to be able to use the service I pay for on my phone. So basically if you ever plan on not watching it on your tv you better be ready to have to go through a couple apps before you can have access to your account. Ended up cancelling cause they release a good show maybe once every 2 years anyways. A shame they raise pricing more and more then cut access to phone users | Netflix has become a greedy corporation and it seems to be worse than others. They kicked me off my family’s account because I’m not on the same network anymore as them. Sorry that I was military, got stationed away from home, and my father wanted to keep my expenses to a minimum. Y’all are absolutely ridiculous and not worth the hassle. | Greedy parasites just can’t seem to let go of their obsession with squeezing every last ounce of money they can from their consumers. I’m glad I canceled my membership because their catalog isn’t even worth the basic price | Unsubscribed | No real improvements to any of this.

The Netflix App is pretty much one of the worst in the market these days. It fails miserably on simple tasks, like it routinely shows you visually that it remembers where you left off (red bar is in about the right place, button text says resume), but when you try to resume, it simply starts at the beginning. This happens about 15% of the time when you stop and resume on the same device, and almost half the time when you are changing devices. The UI is also a disaster and just getting worse all the time. Your “My List” will randomly disappear or relocate itself, the team is proud of the dark ui changes they make, which make the product harder to use but artificially inflate their use/engagement numbers, and various menu items like notifications or whole content sections will randomly disappear and reappear or just bug out when you select anything. The app will only go into PiP mode about 80% of the time, and always pauses. The app also pauses on tablets when you slide anything over. Like, WHY?! The subscription has become much more expensive, and content quality is getting worse every day. The company seems to think their UI and processes are good, but really they’re not, they just had a great idea and implemented it before everyone else, so they were the only way and many people grew up with and got used to it, but it never made it good. Their foreign content (non-US) is still very good, but also seems to be on the decline, and their streaming quality is still very good. Their US content, however, only has a few good properties left and tend to be one-offs or seasons from much earlier that are wrapping up. They like to say they have the best products, properties, culture, etc, but they really don’t.

I jus love that it gives you options for bus stops, tram stops, subways stations, etc. with the name or address you input. When ever there is a delay, the application lets you know. The only thing that I find problematic is that occasionally there are some routes or runnings that have been cancelled (for whatever reason- bus driver sick day, or heavy traffic, or an accident on the road,etc) and this application doesn’t let you know of these extraordinary situations. | No contact phone number 
No way to cancel the ticket

U vlaků, které například z “provozních důvodů” nejedou, stále píše “bez zpoždění”. Údaje tedy nelze bohužel brát vážně. | IDOS je naprosto skvela sluzba, pouzivam ji kazdy den. | Aplikace je skvělá, má ale jeden zbytečný problém, který ji dělá na některých trasách prakticky nepoužitelnou. Jde o čas na přesun. Ten je pevně daný a připočítává se k času na přestup. Např. mezi trasami metra je přesun 3 minuty, přitom se dá pohodlně stihnout za dvě. Nebo na Nádr. Holešovice je přesun na tramvaj podle aplikace 2 minuty, přitom jedna bohatě stačí.

Kvůli tomu aplikace nenajde spoje, které se dají stihnout.

Navrhuji všechny časy na přesun zkrátit na polovinu. Kdo by to nestíhal, může si nastavit čas na přestup, který je vy výchozím nastavení 2 minuty (já používám 0). | Great app, but would be much better if it worked offline as well! | It’s always worked well for me, been using it a few years now.

Alza the company provides no competent human service for faulty products, refunds, or returns.

The problem then becomes solely the customers responsibility.

They do not use or respond to telephones, nor have any inter-office communications. It then becomes a ""Kafka-esque"" rabbit hole of burecratic denial and web based complaint forms.

No formal EU level customer support training for staff yet.

While the purchasing process has been simplified, customer support is then passed along to the manufacturer, and this retailer will not be concerned with solving or processing your concerns.

A narrow profit margin requires a narrow business plan to encourage return customers.

Will not be returning to use this application or support this company.

Keep trying Alza. Improvements  do not qualify success.

Customer satisfaction should be your ONLY objective.

Sad and disappointing. | Entered my phone number, and then spent 10 minutes entering and re-entering different card numbers, and every time it says fraud. | My card was removed from the app. It’s impossible to add new card. Please fix it. | I’ve tried opening new accounts with multiple credit cards and phone numbers and still no luck. Please fix. | EasyPark is really a good App and I would have rated it higher except for one thing that could be easily corrected.  
You have to be careful if you use the very useful camera feature with a car once it is no longer in your possession  - for instance after you finished renting the car or you sold the car.  If you don’t delete the license plate from the App you will pay for the next renter’s parking. 
I wish that the App made this clearer at the time I added the license plate rather than relying on their terms and conditions to inform me.   It would be even better if the camera triggered a request to my App to approve the parking first and not automatically bill. The parking App Pango has such controls built in . | The EasyPark app and system make parking in various cities throughout Europe a breeze. Not needing to worry about carrying around enough change for the meters is wonderful! | I used the app in Italy in a rental car.

Very good customer service. | The app works very smoothly. I love the ever-present countdown timer on the dynamic island.  Very slick! | Very smart app. Makes parking in Iceland super easy | Foreningers have to buy a lot of roaming data just to park… more expensive than parking ticket itself | Need a membership to use the app. No thanks | I visited Iceland for 3 days and used this app successfully during our trip. Returned to the U.S. on March 31. Today is August 16. This is the second time now I’m being charged for whatever strangers out there that rented the same car we did (same plate) after we returned home.

Can’t login to my account. It doesn’t allow me to reset my password. I never received the security text code the app says it’s sending to my phone. Zero options for English speakers to get assistance through customer service. I am being forced to file a dispute with my credit card. Absolutely do NOT recommend this app for tourists using rental cars. | Very disappointing. It just sits and displays a turning circle at a phone number screen. Don’t count on it in Strasberg. | The app wants to send a text message with a code to my American number and the text never arrives.

Called customer support and they said many have called about the same thing and they didn’t have a fix for it.

I have also emailed customer support but they never replies back to my emails. | Wonderful invention! | So much better than trying to navigate a payment at the meter. Can add or stop to the meter remotely. | The only app that declining all my cards | I downloaded the app, entered my phone number and I am not getting sent the verification code.

There is no way to get help from customer service - there is not an English chat bot nor an email address.

Very frustrating. | The add payment method page will not load. With that I won’t be using the app. | There is a quirk in the EasyPark system that causes their system to create a double charge the first time you use them. We were in Tromso, Norway and the only parking near the Polar Museum was operated by EasyPark. We pulled into the lot and downloaded the app. We then started the online meter for our parking. We also used it that same day when we parked at Polaris, the aquarium in Tromso. EasyPark charged our credit card for both parking activations. After we got home Hertz then attempted to charge us for the same parking; I showed them that I had already paid but they said EasyPark would not reimburse them for their charge. I contacted EasyPark and this is what they said:
Hi James.
Thanks for your inquiry.
The space in the license plate has no meaning and does not affect the parking registration as the camera systems/controllers also do not register them. 
From what I can see here, you have been read in on camera at Pellerinbryggene where you actually were, and then you've gone ahead and manually started a parking in a place you weren't. Had you had camera parking enabled in your own app, it would not have been read in on hertz's account, but your own. It is your own responsibility to make sure your parkings are started at the correct place, as the system will not know it outside of cameras.
I am sorry we cannot help you with this.
Have a nice day.

To translate Patrick's response: we can double charge you because before you activated the parking on the app our camera registered your license plate. That is correct, I pulled into the parking lot, downloaded the app, and started the parking BUT because I had not registered the license plate before entering the lot, they went ahead and charged Hertz as the car belonged to them. | Son unos estafadores. De la nada te están cobrando una suscripción y cuando la quieres cancelar te cobran dos meses porque según ellos es lo que dicen sus términos y condiciones en los cuales solo aparece un mes. Les recomienda que utilicen cualquier otra app para parking.

Su servicio por correo tarda una semana en contestar si contestan y el servicio por teléfono te hacen esperar 15 minutos para no poderte dar ninguna solución | Visited Iceland last summer. Discovered that my credit card is still being charged whenever the rental car is parked in fee zones since then. The app does not allow you to remove your credit card, only update it. | I downloaded the app to park on the street, I adjusted my time for 6 hours, and discovered that I have instead selected 180 hrs. When I pressed stop parking, it gives me an error. When I try deleting the account, it says I can’t delete it because of the ongoing parking session. I am no longer parked at the location but am still being charged money. | What a great way to park and manage our time.  This makes it so easy for me.  Thank you | I downloaded this app while traveling in Europe.  The app asks you to link your PayPal account.  DO NOT DO THIS.  They won’t tell you that you are agreeing to prepay for parking whether you use it or not.  I did not use the service and these scammers charged my PayPal account €31.40.   I tried to dispute it but PayPal sided with these guys.  I was supposed to provide a copy of the user agreement as if I had access to such a thing.  Stay away from this scam.  You’ve been warned. | First asked me for a previously used license plate to activate the account. I’ve always used rental cars so had not idea. Deleted account and trying to register again, but when I put it my UK phone number and select Australia as the parking country, nothing happens. I don’t understand why they can’t just do regular accounts like everybody else. | Easy Park is a great app. It was they only one out there that let us - US citizens - pay for parking - easy to use, easy to extend - LOVED IT - until our acct was hacked. Two weeks after we left The Netherlands our credit card was being used daily for some pretty expensive parking and my phone number that I use had been changed. Had to cancel the credit card and get a new one. Easy Park needs to up their security. We only used the app once in The Hague. | I used it multiple days a week without a problem and loved the convenience. However, since a little over a week I all the sudden cannot even get into the app.  The app screen opens asking for my phone number to send a confirmation code to. I never receive the code and there’s no other way to get back into the app. There seriously should be some sort of way to trouble shoot or work around not receiving the text. I’m typing in the correct phone number and country code, I’ve checked countless times.

Super frustrating. 
So I’m back to having to use coins to pay for parking the old fashion way. | Makes parking so much easier with no coins or over payment! Thanks 👍🏾🙏🏾👍🏾 | I find EasyPark easy to use and adjust time as needed.  I appreciate partnerships like QPARK, where EasyPark can be used in place.  If I am unsure whether I need to use EasyPark in an area, I launch the software and it will either show me a pop up of the parking space number so I can set the parking time or it will tell me there is no EasyPark parking option in that area. | So many steps and then the verification email won’t show up right away. Frustrating when you just want to get going and have to spend 10m signing up to just pay for simple parking. Can’t you just accept Apple Pay with no sign up necessary?! Please make this easier. 

Plus you can only sign up with an address from a handful of European countries. | This is a simple and very functional app that avoids the problem of lacking change for parking meters. The ability to add or delete time is genius. | I’m from the United States with a US cell number parking in Switzerland being charged in Swiss Francs and they are billing my PayPal in Norwegian Kroner? Currency exchange fees add up quickly. | (in addition to easy, also extremely reliable offering high confidence of use” | If you’re traveling and happen to be switching rental cars now and then, which is pretty common on trips in foreign countries, please BE AWARE that you need to make sure to change the registration number for the car in the app. If you forget to do this, you’re TOTALLY SCREWED. I paid for parking, but we had just switched to a different rental car and I forgot to change the registration number in the app. I got a slip on my car window telling me I owed them a fine that was over 3x the amount of the parking. I submitted a complaint saying I had actually paid, just under a different registration number and I gave them that number, but no, that’s my fault and I have to pay the fine. PLUS, they’re keeping what I paid for parking under the wrong registration number!??? How is that fair?? Poor business practice and extremely unforgiving. I PAID FOR PARKING!! | Het bedrijf blokkeert direct je (zakelijke) account als een betaling mislukt. Dat is niet zoals het zou horen. Voor mij een reden om over te stappen naar een andere parkeerprovider die wel klantvriendelijk is. | Just do it, so simple! | Not sure what happened. App was working as intended but now it won’t let me make any payments. Tried reinstalling and it never sends and confirmation codes to add a new account. 

Found a backwards way through their website to create an account and now it won’t take any of the credit card info I was using before. 

Seems like a server-side issue. | It used to work, but I got signed out and I’m unable get back in. The issue is that I don’t get the SMS to verify my phone number. | App is supposed to be charging regular price in Zurich, not 15% extra. Zurich plates, Zurich address, Zurich phone number, Zurich parking place…. But app still thinks I am not in an area with the no-surcharge pricing. Please fix. | Très pratique et facile! | good app if it would work but it doesn’t allow me to perform the payment with apple pay for some reason (Apple pay is set up properly on my phone and works for other services). Neither does it allow me to just add a credit card.
I get this error since at least 6 months. | We have successfully downloaded the app, everything went well, till we started the parking: an  unhandled error occurred, please try again.. yeah, it’s really “easy”park.. thanks | Installed the app, easy breezy.
Credit card info and payment, no problem.
Installed app on different device with same mobile number, app demands a login and password. “Secure numeric code sent to mobile phone”
No place on app to set up password.
No message sent to mobile phone (yes, I entered it correctly)

Stockholm, there is a problem with your basic app function. | Went to Iceland on vacation and returned to
the US. Unfortunately, I forgot my password. I tried using the password recovery numerous times and I have received an sms message. I had to call my credit card company to stop this app from charging my card. Somehow they have found a ways to charge my card even though I disputed the charges and had them blocked. | Seemed to be >30% fee on top of cash

I like Foodora, but Wolt supports live activities so I usually order from there now. | Jako jídlo přivezou ale doplatek za malou objednavku?

Could not have accomplished this without the help of this app. Have ordered like 4 times with it since we been here now.

Tried again on my wife’s phone, refused. Deleted the app and picked up food myself. Probably not to use delivery services anyway, bad for restaurants. | Compared to Bolt the user interface is terrible. We cannot see a map showing where the rider is.

Overall it’s really nice app. | no favorites and no way to repeat an order, and lots of bugs - delivery works tho! | Ordered pizza and it was going to be delayed which is not a big deal, it happens. 

But then they emailed saying trying to reach me- I’m at a hotel and gave hotel number because it kept turning my a czech number.

The new look is terrible! Why “fix” what isn’t broken?!! The user interface is worse than previous versions, and it is inaccurate! I frequently enter a word in another language to see if I have the correct tense, and it translates back to English as if it’s correct, but when I enter it back in, in English, it doesn’t translate to the other language the same way! And when I check online, I find it’s NOT correct! This app has become far too unreliable for use when I am needing accuracy for major Crossword creation, or any other use! I hope you will address these issues, and PLEASE return it to a normal size and font!!
## When an ENGLISH speaking person needs a translation for another language, like Japanese, it does NO GOOD to only translate in Japanese text without the actual SPOKEN WORD translation!

It doesn’t cost you anything to do it and it’s really simple, I really recommend it you should try it out on your own. | Bring back the old UI (interface) its so much better and simple to use, people would rate this app 5 stars if you bring back the old UI and it would be used more and be recommended by everyone and this app might just be #1, just update this garbage UI | Good day,
Whatever happened to the paste button on the app? That was the option on the app that I used the most.
Can we please fix that 

Thank you | I can’t get past the pay to use screen.
Why is this not free. | HOLYGOOGLETRANSLATEINALLLAW | yes | Проблема с переводом скопированного текста, не могу вставить доя перевода | Google always makes unknown or nobody like myself useful like adding translate to Khmer. Thanks Google for making it free now. | It translates ANYTHING for you and if you don’t know how to speak a certain language they give you the option to have a conversation using your phone!!!! As soon as I got this app I was like oh it’s like every other app that’s asking you for money and not letting you use it. But no I well don’t get my wrong it does ask you if you want to pay a subscription but if you say no it will still let you use the app with no locked things. 

-A Human Being | return transcriptions to translated words! why did you remove them?! Bring back the swipe to switch the translation language! bring back the list of downloaded and frequently used languages ​​that was always at the top! make 5-6 languages ​​that are often used as fixed as before! | When I upload an image with text in a foreign language with Detect language > English as the orientation, it translates, but instead of saying which language was detected, it just says ✨English > English. That is not helpful. 

I looked around to see if I was somehow overlooking this information, but on the latest version of the iOS app, it's not there. I had to click the text within the image, drag to highlight all of it, click ""copy,"" then paste it in the main translation page text box. That's a lot more effort than I anticipated.

Please fix this. | Устарело
Сделайте как на андроиде | I use this app to read old American newspapers that were in German. The fount itself makes it hard to read, but this app had no problem with it.
However, navigating within the app is problematic and getting back to the original screen is next to impossible | I also been using this to transcribe some chinese writing, when verified with my Chinese friends, they said it’s all wrong.
I also travel to Mexico and use this to try and converse with Spanish speakers, I think most of the time it’s correct and then lately this past year I looked at the text or spoken words and recognized some words are wrong . Whoever is updating this need to be accurate or don’t translate because 
it can get very messy and embarrassing!
I’ll try another app for my next trip which will be india and Hindi , wish me luck ! | It mainly repeats in English whatever word I typed in Spanish. Only occasionally does it actually translate. Frustrating. | جميل بس ينقصه نطق الترجمة بالصوت 🌺 كانت موجودة والان غير موجودة بالتطبيق اتمنى اضافتها | It keeps asking me for reviews and I can't get anything done , I rather pay for a translator so it doesn't intrupt me . | I hate the new interface layout.

I didn’t have to do this previously, and it’s much more frustrating and time-consuming!

Solo eso le ase falta | I’m trying to practice my Spanish but the record options doesn’t last long enough to even record one sentence so what’s even the point of having the option to record? Also the settings are very limited | The last update made my widget invisible. Please fix | 能不能改善一下转录功能，各种听不懂音频，还不如老版本的好用 | For more than 5 years, I have been using Google translate between Spanish & English while studying with Duolingo.

Recently the translations have not matched Duolingo. Is there a better translator to use with Duolingo? | This app has made me so happy that I recommend that everyone download this app for there phone. So amazing so helpful i appreciate all you beings at Google and I can’t wait to see what you come out with next because totally awesome.

Thank you

And thank you again | I would of given this a better review but when say a word in Greek it most of time comes out as a completely different word. I can say word multiple times and might even come out differently every time. Yes I tried to say it slowly or faster still the same. But if type it it does translate it correctly | This app is very helpful and overall a gift. However, there are many text-to-speak options missing for formerly colonised African languages. 

For example they have Igbo, one of many languages spoken in Nigeria, but they do not have text-to-speak options. 

Naturally someone will say that since there are so many languages, Google cannot get the text-to-speech feature for all of them. 

They will also say they hope to get around to it like they have for other African languages, but sadly the countries which once tried to erase the existence of these languages have long since been fully featured on the app.

There seems to be a prioritising of languages which allows some to be fully featured, while others waste away in waiting with hopes of being recognised by the world, though many taste the use of them on their tongues. 

I hope to one day have text-to-speech for Igbo and many other African languages, but I am tempted to think it would be unwise to wait with bated breath. That being said, I still appreciate this remarkable resource. | So I can no longer use Google Translate with my iPhone 7 because of this change. What about this app required then to not allow any devices lower than iOS 7? | What a great App it is! It is very useful and helpful.👏 I love it so much ❤️❤️ Thanks very much. Have a great and nice day with the best and sweetest moments. From Tehran Iran 💐🍀🌺 | It’s very good to learn meaning and talking so fast | Hello, thank you Google for continuing to improve this app. However, for those who are Star Trek fans it would be interesting to have the Klingon language as an option for translate :) 

Thanks, LLAP 🖖

The PID Lítačka mobile app is a comprehensive guide to transport in Prague and the Central Bohemian Region. It enables you to find current public transport connections based on your location and also recommends the type of ticket you need for your journey. The app works with up-to-date data about closures, disruptions, and so on. If you wish to use the app for buying tickets regularly, you can create an account and have your tickets safely under control. You can store your payment card in the app and pay with a single click, or use Google/Apple Pay. The app allows you to purchase tickets in advance and activate them gradually before boarding a vehicle. Furthermore, you can purchase a subscription ticket (coupon) from 1 month up to 1 year directly in the app.

A new feature in PID Lítačka is the ability to pay for parking in paid parking zones throughout Prague. This new functionality allows you to store the license plates of your personal and company vehicles and pay for parking as easily and quickly as for a ticket.

The app can be used even without registration.

What else does the app offer?

-Check-in via the mobile app, or the possibility to use the mobile app as an identifier for long-term time tickets
-Find the fastest connection including closures and restrictions, and optimal tickets for your journeys
-Display a map of connections including navigation to the stop
-Display the status of your long-term coupon and your identifiers
-Buy tickets in advance with the option of later activation if necessary
-Forward an unactivated ticket to another person who can simply activate it themselves
-Purchase up to 10 tickets and activate multiple of them at once, for example for family and friends
-Display current departures from the stop, including delays
-Show an overview of nearby stops, passing lines, ticket sales locations
-Display a map of P+R parking lots and their occupancy
-Browse current closures, disruptions, or news in transport
-Monitor the status of barrier-free facilities
-Ability to pay for parking in paid parking zones throughout Prague

I could buy tickets on the fly or plan our route the night before. With tickets in hand, I always knew what stop or platform to go to. | Agree with others: easy to use, mapping a route provides cost and link to pay, Apple Pay enabled. One of the best transportation apps I’ve used. | Twice now I have tried to create an account. I signed up with one email and a message said I’d be getting a verification email. I have been checking for over 24 hours and there is no email. So I then tried a different email and still no verification email ever came. Update: the emails all went to my spam. That hasn’t happened in forever, therefore I attribute it to whatever is in the origin of the email sender. | Should be an instance for everyone else! | I was only in Prague for a few days but this app worked very well, the design and user interface was excellent, it was easy to use and figure out, each ticker gives you a bar code but we never got stopped so not sure if that works for the police. One thing to note is when you buy tickets on the app you need to wait 2 minutes after you activate before it becomes valid so buy tickets before you get on | Not a bad app, but the two minutes to activate is a major issue. The inspectors come and will fine you with as little as 10 seconds left before it activates, and since they can check whomever they want, they often target women, especially those riding alone. I just ended up buying the year pass, but for people who ride only once or twice, the two minutes is a huge pain. Either you get on before your ticket activates and hope, or you activate it before the bus/tram/metro even arrives—cutting into the amount of time you’ve paid to be allowed to travel. And if the bus is late, and so your ticket expires before you reach your destination? That’s a fine, too. Major design flaw! | Does exactly what it’s supposed to. Always very easy to use! | Everything I needed for public transport in Prague. It was super easy to register and pay via Apple Pay. | I enabled alert for “Exceptions” and found it was too many notifications. I disabled it within the app but still receive alerts. 

Otherwise, for purchasing lowest-price tickets I find it is the most useful app, even for long trips outside of Prague. | Every time I search for a connection and press ""Search"", it instead searches for the most recent connection from my search history. This bug has been there for months, there's no way to report it from the app, so obviously the developer doesn't care at all about their user experience. I'm switching to pubtran. | I was just about to buy two tickets on my phone and found out that only one has been purchased. I wanted to purchase another one for my wife and got an error, even though money was deducted from my account!
What do I do when an inspection comes?! | Terrible that the app doesn’t notify when you pass expires. This cost me CZK824 in fines. 

The app is very poor indeed and they refuse to reimbursement for their design flaw. 

No Apple Wallet integration. 

App redirects you to the crappy website so you have to login to a website within an app. | You can’t buy tickets with iOS 13 as your OS. The tickets do not show up so I was forced to buy a paper ticket. | Is this app not compatible with iOS 13? I am not able to buy any tickets, the screen to buy just says “ticket selection could not be loaded”. My wife’s phone had no problem on iOS 12. | Great app. Clear navigation options, accurate timetables and with Apple Pay integration, makes it super easy to purchase tickets. Other translation apps take notice! | Must have, works perfectly fine. It has all the live updates that you need. | It is decent enough when it functions properly, but in 90% of the time you'll see a message saying ""At this moment there is no connection for the data entered.""

And you'll need to click the 'search' button again and again and again in order to see the results. | Aplikace jako taková je celkem povedená, ale velmi často v ní dochází k této chybě: ""Pro zadané hodnoty v tuto chvíli neexistuje žádné spojení."" K této chybě dochází nezávisle na zadaných hodnotách a dochází k ní i na dobrém připojení, např. na 4G nebo WiFi. Pokud hledání např. pětkrát zopakuji, tak se většinou nakonec najde. K této chybě nedochází vždy, ale zhruba při polovině pokusů. Asi jde o přetížené servery nebo něco podobného.

Would you please try to add Mongolian? 😅 | After new update the application doesn’t work on my iPhone 15 I can’t sign in when I want to sign in it said something failed | I would try to use it to make videos but it wouldn’t make captions when I was talking. When I tried to make them myself it wouldn’t let me adjust the timing | I rate this a 1 because I have to buy a subscription to do anything, devs if you see this please change this | Trendy and easy to use! | I thought it was free to export but I didn’t know that it costed money so that’s why I give it a 1 star. | Didn’t recognize my speech accurate at all.
VERY off. Inputting Manually was a huge waste of time | Anytime, I’m adding subtitles or effects. I use this app exclusively. | This is honestly unbelievable. I figured I’d give it a show and it was extremely competent. And fast at that. Sheeesh A.I is something else! | There’s a limit to the number of AI shorts you can create. I’ve waited 5 days and still can’t create another one. This isn’t advertised before you pay $10 for a month of the service. I canceled my subscription. | Not as it is advertising . I am used to CapCut and I tried this app and I can tell you . THIS IS NOT A FRIENDLY APP! If the free version is very difficult and limited I can’t only image the paid version !! NOPE !! | This app works very accurately even in a difficult language like Farsi | The caption customization is unmatched. But I wa shocked how well the other AI features work, specifically AI eye contact. Once you get a hang of the editor the other features are easier to play with (sounds, zooms). Much prefer over CapCut already! | I tried out Captions and don’t get me wrong it is a game changer but it is glitchy and difficult to use as the app VEED is better imo in using and having more preferences. | The overall app is very easy to use. However, when exporting footage, the first few captions or first sentence do NOT export. I’ve updated the app and contacted support but nothing seems to work. Very frustrating when this is a paid app and it doesn’t even work. | I paid for an annual subscription in January. I’ve got a new phone. Captions won’t let me back in and tells me I need to buy another subscription. Then when I try to report the issue On discord, the discord server won’t allow me to confirm my phone number. I have no choice but to report this by leaving a bad review. | You could type in a topic and it would write a short script. Now you have to edit the script because some genius decided to have the AI now write an actual movie script like: “aerial shot of mountains as you talk about” etc between the actual script. How stupid.

Your response to my review has nothing to do with what I wrote. | So much more fun doing captions with the different font styles and the colors! | No complaints, A++ level quality, easy to use, worth the membership | I need this kind of tool for editing, and work! It’s not only super convenient but it makes my videos and ads etc look great and more professional! The subscription is so worth it, as are all of the features! Thank you for everything and the amazing people who work here!! | It looks like a good app but there should be more instructions and support. | Captions makes achieving professional editing results so simple. The app's capabilities are vast, yet the interface is so user-friendly that even beginners can produce high-quality content. It's the perfect blend of sophistication and simplicity.",4.71868,519,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/f0/a6/eb/f0a6ebcc-0764-2a69-1c52-9e3758a10bb6/8ac31e70-f601-4550-aff9-e02533793b94_appstore_5.8_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/b1/3e/e1/b13ee1da-ccac-75c8-addd-685c9a9a0fd6/ac506a35-0973-4377-a46f-bf89c0af3b2c_appstore_5.8_02-1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ab/9d/14/ab9d144b-1e6f-75d8-df86-5d5439691ad6/245bae5e-769a-4a66-b283-706315b383fb_appstore_5.8_02-2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/80/52/85/8052856d-bc1c-e68d-d192-2265a5f3bfc9/ac141dab-57c5-4ab5-8d31-f41e464ceb80_appstore_5.8_02-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/43/21/3b/43213b0e-52ae-487f-d178-d8cd0b072f4b/3a3c6389-0ec3-48c7-8e0a-64518d2ffea6_appstore_5.8_02-4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/14/33/50/143350ce-4c9c-feaf-0699-118b00e91958/23c99211-3ab3-467e-95f0-3e37f6bea502_appstore_5.8_02-5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/61/31/5a/61315aa4-a012-0244-3ace-14fb6d0fdb23/60e4bd98-aa9f-49c1-8428-7a89ec668a46_appstore_5.8_02-6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/42/5e/5c/425e5c65-e9c3-bae1-23da-f10221839da3/0989ec69-2447-4224-a523-72b9dc9cf297_appstore_5.8_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/50/b2/fb/50b2fb8f-dde6-18ad-0b15-174f5875cccb/0f1af307-fed8-4a09-8fc4-f6507e78b194_appstore_5.8_02-8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/9e/08/79/9e08793a-ac17-f4e3-094b-f54a38e272dc/fe9248ad-5d3c-47a0-93c9-9cb3b4030414_appstore_5.8_02-9.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""MacDesktop-MacDesktop"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Aplikace Meteoradar je jednou z nejstahovanějších aplikací na iPhone a iPad. Aplikace nabízí řadu zajímavých funkcí. Zobrazí nejen aktuální srážky nad Českem, ale i jejich předpověď na následující hodinu. Nechybí ani údaje o aktuálních teplotách, větru, srážkách nebo stavu počasí. Meteoradar umožňuje sledovat vývoj počasí téměř v reálném čase. Data jsou aktualizována každých 10 minut.

* Srážky a jejich předpověď (radar)
Aplikace na mapě zobrazí aktuální srážky nad Českem a Německem s přesností až 1 km. Nechybí ani předpověď jejich vývoje na následující hodinu (dostupné u českého radaru). Přesně tak poznáte, kdy přeháňka dorazí přímo do vašeho města. Radarové snímky Česka poskytuje ČHMÚ a snímky Německa poskytuje DWD.

* Údaje z meteostanic
Na mapě jsou dostupné údaje z více než 150 meteorologických stanic. Meteorologické stanice zaznamenávají teplotu, vítr, srážky ale i vlhkost nebo tlak vzduchu. U každé stanice je v grafu uveden vývoj teploty.

* Blesky
V případě bouřek aplikace zobrazí i místa, kde uhodil blesk. Na základě radarového snímku potom poznáte, jak se bude bouřka nadále vyvíjet.

* Meteozprávy
Aplikace zobrazuje informace o počasí přímo od uživatelů, kteří sledují počasí v daných místech.

* Přidávejte informace o počasí
Aplikace umožňuje zasílat informace o počasí ve vaší lokalitě. Pokud se u vás vyskytuje například silná bouřka, stačí v aplikaci vytvořit hlášení o počasí, které si následně přečtou stovky lidí. Přidat můžete aktuální fotografii či popis počasí. Ostatní lidi tak varujete před nepříznivým počasím, které panuje ve vašem městě a pravděpodobně zasáhne i další.  

* Widget
Díky přehlednému widgetu získáte rychlý přehled o aktuálních srážkách na našem území.

Poskytovatelem radarových snímků a detekce blesků z Česka je Český hydrometeorologický ústav. Poskytovatelem radarových snímků Německa je DWD.

Long story short, no matter what product I’m using, Google will be on it! | Gracias por poder guardar recuerdos en ti | Excelente gracias | Love this app must have on ERRYTHANG | I just downloaded this app two days ago and I have gotten over 200 pop ups and emails. I hate I signed up for this and should have stuck with my iPhone saving everything. Wayyyyy more space and less alerts. | This app has never let me down. It has always been there for me and it has been outstanding. | Great app, easy to use. I love the recommendations and the cute memories it puts together. | Google Photos is one of the first things I look after I wake up because it starts my day off with happiness!   I love looking to watch a memory created with my photographs.  I recommend everyone install Google Photos.  I’m still learning how to navigate everything, and I need to learn more about sharing anything because I’m afraid of sharing something to the wrong person.  Need to learn more about messaging the people I share memories and photos.   Absolutely LOVE the stylized and cinematographic photos!!! Google Photos is amazing—
THANK YOU😊 | An excellent app for keeping precious memories. | Photo library is refreshed infrequently; yes, the background option is on. Editing photos is slow and has a subset of the features available on the Google Pixel. Want to mark up your photos w/a stylus on a new large screen iPad? Tough, go pound sand. 

We pay for Google One and that gives us additional storage, no features. 

This is the bastard child of Google’s apps. | Excelente herramienta | Muy bueno me ayuda a tener toda mis recuerdos y lo mejor q cambio de tlf y se me pasa todo | Amazing the way you can create almost any type of photo or video from stored pictures and videos with this app. | I like it | One of the bestes!!! | Department of Health Services | Great way to store photos and upload them when you need them. | Wish it was easier to access private photos and share them sometimes lol | Takes 
So long

Done | The best photos app | With Google pix All my photos in one place. | I like Google Photos because they tell you when to update your stuff or when to move your stuff what to delete I mean how to delete it how to organize it. It is simple because they tell you how to do everything. I gotta press the button very easy. Thank you, Google Photos. | Making strides thanks to the UX Interface! | Excellent App!!! | This app has helped me save so many memories. Easily accessible, anywhere and anytime. | Love the way you can archive free space. Easy to use | Decent app but not enough storage space for my family of photogenic beauties. | Excelente,

The majority of the murders it funds is directed mostly towards children !!! | I have truly had the worst experience with Air bnb. I tried booking 4 hotel rooms with a specific host just for her to decline each request and tell me that the dates weren’t available, even though the site was showing it was available for when I needed it. This person had over 100 apartment units available to book on the Air bnb site. I asked if any were available and she told me NO. Not to mention my account got restricted because they suspected fraud since I tried booking 4 apartment units back to back. I contacted customer support 3 times about getting my account corrected. My account will be restricted for 10 days. They were no help what so ever. Their only solution was to have one of my guest book the apartment. I tried booking under my mothers Air bnb account just for me to have issues with her account as well. I ended up on the phone with air bnb 3 times on behalf of her account. My experience has been horrible. I have given up. I recommend using another app like Vrbo. This experience was extremely unexpected. And not to mention this was my FIRST TIME BOOKING WITH AIR BNB. I have heard good things about air bnb so this was very unexpected. | This is a review of the Airbnb app only not the service. 

The app is the best version they’ve ever released! I can do pretty much everything for my cell phone. It’s intuitive and lacks the clutter that every other booking app has her hosts. | I’ve had several good experiences with Airbnb, and when things go smoothly, it can be a great experience.  But when hosts misrepresent their properties, or act out of bad faith, Airbnb does surprisingly little to step in and address the issues.

We recently had a trip where the host listed the size of their home to be 50%+ bigger than it actually was. When we reported it to Airbnb, they said there was little they could do and any refund would have to come willingly from the host (who obviously declined to give any money back).  The host was clearly acting in bad faith and admitted the place was not as large as advertised, and Airbnb continued to let him list it without issue (my hunch is that he makes Airbnb a significant amount of money through his dozens of properties, and they don’t want to ruffle his feathers).

After a lot back and forth with Airbnb support, they offered to refund $9 on a $5,000. Unbelievable.

The system works when everything is good, but when anything else happens, be prepared for Airbnb to leave you stranded and keep your money. | In an app, like this, it would be basic functionality to allow the users to hide properties which they don’t like.
Anytime, I have to search for a rental, it’s like finding a needle in a haystack.
I keep going over the same properties over and over and then just give up and book a hotel. Lol. | Six of us traveled together and booked an airbnb. Three out of six come home with bedbug bites. I provided clear photos to customer support seeking for a solution, but they refuse to step in, claiming unless I have photos of the bedbug, they can’t do anything. Knowing bedbug bites takes few days to show plus we had a short trip, this seem like Airbnb is protecting the host. We stepped back and said if they can’t issue any refund, at least temporarily suspend the host to protect other users. Airbnb refuses again. So travelers, don’t use airbnb — your safety is NOT protected!! Go get a hotel room instead | Our family booked a condo in Cambridge Ma March 13-17.  The owner Adam was not allowed to do short term rentals in this building (Airbnb’s).  I have evidence showing this from the building owner and management.  The apartment was extremely dirty and had a horrible smell.  Airbnb asked for proof.  So I returned to the apartment and took timestamp photos.  The owner(Adam) disputed the claims/photos.  Saying I doctored the photos.  Airbnb refused to provide a refund.  I would NOT use Airbnb. | I have been a loyal airbnb customer for 5 years. I will never use airbnb again. I heard people say they dont like airbnbs because they are never clean . Now I see what everyone means. My last 3 airbnbs have been disgusting and each time it gets worse. The worse part about airbnb  is they take the HOST side before the consumer and we pay all the money. They don’t compensate you for the dirty and unsafe listing. Airbnb support told me my host was being to kind for refunding me for the days after I cancel my airbnb ! As she should because I wont be there !!!! The blatant disrespect has lost a loyal customer. Airbnb should be ASHAMED ! | I rented an apartment and I got a notice of the host not paying rent. When I contacted air bnb they said they couldn’t do anything! I paid way more than the actual rent, since I had the bill, and was shocked to know Air Bnb couldn’t do a thing! I had to handle it with my host, is what they said. Why do I pay a service fee then? How can you allow someone to post a rental if it’s not paid for on the host side? The customer service has gone downhill dramatically in the last year. So many issues with so many properties and they never help. After 6 years I am done with this app. Hotels at least are more accountable than this platforms and it’s rentals. | So Awesome | This company is a scam, it has absolutely no customer service. I have several issues with the app itself and for a stay I did using the app. I am chatting on the app and random people come and say they will work on the case but fee mins later they are gone and no updates for several days. Chat bot keeps asking do you still need help but that dumb bot doesn't see that airbnb has done nothing. I have called and talked to actual people but they say they will work but nothing is done by them as well. I previously reported issue to executive team and that person said let me work on it and get back to you but it has been more than a month and no one has responded. Disgusting app experience and with the staff of airbnb | I have used airbnb for years. They decided to remove my account with no further explanation, asked for an appeal and the information they based this decision on. Just denied my appeal and removed my account unfairly. This app was great, has been horrible this past year. | Don’t download this. For some reason it needed a card put in then it took $22 from my account. Very annoying | after years of dealing with discrimination, terrible customer service, rates above market price, and a platform that puts its hosts above its guests, I just had my last negative experience. Verbo and hotels.com are better in every way. | They don’t care anymore. 
Customer service will leave you hanging with no way to escalate issue to upper management. 

What are we suppose to do now | I had decent experience with airbnb. My issue comes in with the “review” system. I don’t feel it is fair that the app urges us to give the host a good review or it won’t be posted, but the host can write a bad review about the customer and it gets posted with no issues. Plus we have to “dispute” a negative review through support which takes forever if it even happens. It’s very dishonest and unfair to current and future users. All reviews about the host should be posted, good or bad because all reviews get posted about the customer no matter if it’s good or bad. I will not use the app anymore because of this. I deleted my account. | Verification system threw up random error messages on browser when trying to verify phone number.
Then after I try on the app it says I can’t confirm for 24 hours?!
Talked to customer service representative but they were VERY unhelpful. | I have used Airbnb for 6 years. On 4 different occasions I have booked an Airbnb 5+ months out from my scheduled trip and then had the hosts cancel on me right before. This year, Airbnb allowed the host to cancel on me 2 days before my trip leaving me to panic and scramble to find a new one. I tried numeorus times reaching out for assistance and got nothing in return. I can no longer rely on Airbnb, there is no point in booking one since hosts can cancel whenever. The hosts have too much power and Airbnb does nothing to protect or assist renters. | Just felt bitter about recent encounter with Airbnb. I had an excursion planned in Europe and my flight was cancelled in Amsterdam’s — thanks KLM. I didn’t make a flight and Airbnb would not try to workout a deal and charged $250+ even though it wasn’t our fault.
Peace, 
Max | Idk what I would do without airbnb honestly ! Wether it's for traveling , work, vacation, or lifestyle good or bad! It's definitely worth booking through, no resort fees or security deposits ! | 2 of the last 3 times I used AirBnB, the listings seriously misrepresented the property. One claimed to have 3 bathrooms; in actuality the property had only 1 toilet. The other claimed to be oceanfront / beachfront; in actuality it was ~1 or 2 blocks from the beach. (The 3rd one was honest and wonderful). 
I don’t know if I’ll use AirBnB again. It’s a risk. Owners seem fine with making stuff up and AirBnB seems not to have any mechanism to ensure accurate listings, they try to get you to “work it” with the owner. | When things go wrong your on your own.  They will not protect you and you will not get your money back, we call this a scam in business.  
What a joke.  They used to be good but now have no moral compass.  Sad. | I had a host accept my alternate stay and she never refunded my money back. I called Airbnb Support and she didn’t respond to them. I lost out on $687.09 . The Customer Service is in India so you will not get any help with that either. If the host withheld your refund, the host can negotiate what they want to give back. This is company is not about the customer it’s about the host. | I don’t know how people afford to book Airbnbs anymore. The fees are just out of control. Between the cleaning and booking fees, it’s literally half the price if you stay at a hotel.  Airbnb please reign this in and go back to basics. As far as the app, filtering options are limited…and quite inaccurate. If I search for waterfront, I’m not interested in your property that’s a 1 mi drive to the water. 🙄 | At lease at a hotel you can hold someone accountable and/or get a refund if the host doesn’t hold up their end of the deal. AirBnB does not have any interest in your complaints or concerns. The rental could be completely wrong, full of bugs, mold, and you will be stuck for the duration. Don’t take my word for it, just research AIRBNB nightmares and you’ll find that this organization is completely corrupt and the hosts are more often than not dishonest in their listings and Airbnb does not verify that listings are as advertised. A scheme all the way to the top. I lost months of funds while traveling due to booking extended stays at a string of listings that fell very short of expectation, including the bugs and mold. It was too late once I realized that no matter what listing I ended up at, none of them were as advertised and the company told me too bad. Video evidence, pictures. Didn’t matter. They just assumed it was in bad faith. They tell you to settle it on site with the host. They’ll tell you the host has THE ENTIRE DURATION of your stay to resolve the issue. Even if they make no effort to resolve the complaint, it still counts. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE. | Why do you hide addresses? I’m trying to book a place and I want to look up on a map how close it is to trails. Your built in map doesn’t show the trails so I need the address to look on a trail map. In the end I didn’t book through this app. Hiding the address is shady! Hotels don’t hide their address. I booked a hotel instead! Completely stupid business model! | The idea that Airbnb allows their host to charge crazy high cleaning fees is ridiculous. You should not be allowed to charge a daily cleaning unless you are cleaning daily!!!

Airbnb needs to get rid of the cleaning fees and let the hosts build that price into their rental rates - just like a hotel. | Why is it that I can’t use the app I have. If I can’t download new one it seems wrong to force me to upgrade to a new phone. | Air bnb used to be a good option, but now since all air bnb’s charge $200 plus cleaning fees on top of all the other fees, and built in rules…. Requiring you to clean…. It lost its luster. At least at hotels you don’t have to clean and you also get free breakfast. | Airbnb used to be so much better - now the customer service is non existent, with any problems you will be speaking to a robot, and my last 3 cases I spent useless hours and nothing was ever resolved! Pull it together Airbnb! No more robots for customer service - give us Real and logical humans! | Limited trust and safety. Multiple scams ongoing related to insufficient host/ fraud checks. Constantly see reviews purporting scams and false placements. | Their host are always so awful. they all just wanna steal your money. horrible app do not recommend. They will try to charge you on top of the total price. overall a horrible app. | Worst experience staying somewhere of my life. $20/night apt and the hosts never settled on how to pay for it. Then pressed charges when stuff was missing from her apartment after I left it in perfect condition minus a used towel. | After arriving at Arthur's condo in Phoenix we requested to cancel because it was the most unsafe area we had ever tried to stay while using Airbnb. I consistently use this service while traveling for work. After the poor and lack of communication from air bnb I will most likely not use this service anymore. 
To give an example the parking lot of the condo and surrounding area was littered with drug addicts dealers and what seemed to be a tent city across the street. I highly recommend not staying here. I'm from the South Side of Chicago and didn't want to get out of the car if you know what I mean. 
There has been no support from air bnb and we will be contacting our credit card company for a refund. | I came to the Airbnb service so that I would not have to worry about finding a place to live. I found 2 ads and both turned out to be fraudulent. How do you keep the service clean? I don't want to look anywhere for housing, I'm ready to pay extra for airbnb service. They are trying to deceive me, at first they tried to take me to their third-party site, then they say that the ad I chose is unavailable, the room is occupied, they offered another one for $ 300 more expensive. Well, I agreed, now they ask to be contacted by phone before confirming the reservation. I am dissatisfied with the Airbnb service, I will never use it again and I will not recommend it to anyone. | I’ve had continual issues with Airbnb over the last year, I can never reserve anything with a vague “something went wrong” error. Tried on multiple browsers and multiple devices until I inevitably get a “too many attempts message”. | Too much expensive . Booking hotel seems to be better than Airbnb | I went to Spokane from Ohio for my sons, chemotherapy treatments me and my wife and my son, when we first got there, we booked under my wife’s account and ended up having to leave the first Airbnb. We were at because of family emergencies and they needed their home and so we booked a different day well the night after we got there I got a notification from our Host stating that Airbnb canceled our reservation and we needed to leave immediately. I didn’t understand why so my wife went into her account to check to see what happened and they completely removed her account and said that we were partying even though they had no proof or evidence because we weren’t. Well, we asked for a refund for the rest of the nights because we spent $900 and they kept saying they would escalate our case escalate. Our case never contacted us back never put the account back up and never gave us a refund for our money. Well, we went and booked an Airbnb under my name on my account and ended up getting robbed. All of our belongings got stolen and Airbnb helped us with rebooking we rebooked the Airbnb. We had the hot tub didn’t work so we wanted to go somewhere else. They issued us a coupon and the second they issued all those coupons to my account, they sent me an email stating they were removing my account from the platform for party risk of partying, again with no evidence and no warning at all and now they are refusing to talk to us at all and I just lost over $900 again which is totaling out to about $1900 that we’ve lost within the last week and now they refuse to give us our accounts back or even a gift voucher with the amount on it so we could get somewhere else to stay. Do not book with Airbnb. They will scam you. | Mario is been the best host you can ever find, this is the second time using his house and his responses are fast and efficient, thank you Mario | I have been utilizing Air bnb since its inception and I will tell you that it is the hosts that define the quality of this product and not the app.  That being said, the Airbnb app is now the most convenient tool  to find alternatives to hotels in the travel biz.  I do find google search to run a close second to this app and find google infinitely easier to use- such that I find many Airbnb on google then get the details on Airbnb app.  

I still find Airbnb format, codes and operation extraordinarily ineffective in getting the whole picture.  Even many reviews reveal hidden codes as “cozy bed” meaning its rented for 2 people but its not even a queen bed -or- “rustic” surroundings meaning a junkyard is on the same block as where you are staying. 

Also, app navigation has never been that intuitive. I still find myself vetting stuck in places and starti g the app over. It is as if they never really knew what a “back button” was. 

In the end, I have had many good experiences and one or two exceptional ones, all being because the host made it so. 

March 2020 entry

The app has definitely gotten better with a few issues remaining. Receipts can be viewed but not printed, emailed, or otherwise utilized in any way!?? House rules seem to be more dodgy than ever. Sometimes they are easily found, sometimes theyare emailed after a reservation and almost all are rants of disorganized personalities 🤪 . Airbnb survives because of really cool people hosting the coolest and most diverse amenities ever offered. Airbnb serves this market with an average score of 3 stars. App now cuts off text messages and inhibits return messages even inside the app. Het twice the messages tou cannot respond to. Cool! Just keeps getting worse! This app is different but not better Has the search by map been removed or moved where I can't find it?? Why is taking longer to find more unavailable properties? Just updated again to try features and tools. App freezes... App is still clunky but better than it was but I just got recommended stays a surprising distance from my intended destination..... The app is worse than ever and the whole AIRBNB system is getting to be a frustrating mess. I have attempted to book 5 locations in the last 6 months with one success. After a major frustration I was offered over $100 instant credits and still chose not to book with AIR BNB...... This is getting unfriendlier and more ""corporate"" by the day. Earlier version .... Whoever released this needs to roll it back up! I have attempted to book stays with complete frustration and mix ups. The app has reversed it performance of user ease. Avoid this new version.... | It said to update so I did and now it’s just a black screen | $300 a night? lol, don’t forget $160 Airbnb fees, $150 taxes, and of course the $250 cleaning fee. Airbnb rates are a joke and so many renters know it and offer their properties on other sites or on personal pages for much less. I doubt you’ll ever find your best deal here. | Airbnb refused to give my handicap mother a refund, even though the property we tried to rent from Stuart Morley was not handicap accessible! There wasn't even room for my mom's wheelchair anywhere and we only stayed a few days out of the 25 that we reserved. Airbnb has this individual to steal from us with no ability to recover the money and the trip interruption insurance they offer is worthless too, and didn't cover anything! Don't ever use this service or you'll lose your money and never be able to get it back. They purposely allow people that they are being prejudiced towards handicap people to continue to be on there and make money from their service. Airbnb is a bunch of thieves. | Since New update, the app will not open on my phone. Just rotates the app symbol. | Most of my personal travel is with my four-legged friend. It is so much easier and less expensive to use AirBNB instead of hotel chains.  Occasionally I use it for business travel when I am looking for a specific area and can’t find a hotel. | I had always heard from friends how Airbnb scams its customers and it happened to me too. I was held responsible for existing damages in a cabinet and was charged $150 for the chipped corner paint. I have many other friends telling me how the hosts show repair documentation and they go and proceed to over charge for existing damages in a property and they try to hold you responsible for it. | THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY, AS LONG AS THEY MAKE MONEY OFF OF YOU. NARROWLY ESCAPED A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I recently experienced a concerning situation during a reservation with Airbnb, prompting me to share a cautionary tale with fellow users. Regrettably, my experience has led me to conclude that Airbnb’s commitment to customer safety may not align with their public image. Despite raising genuine safety concerns during my stay and providing detailed information, the response from Airbnb’s support team exhibited a lack of thorough consideration and logical coherence. The decision-making process appeared flawed, with the introduction of logical fallacies and an apparent disregard for the gravity of the issues raised. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with Airbnb’s customer service, as it seems the platform prioritizes financial transactions over the safety and well-being of its users. Consequently, I have chosen to discontinue using Airbnb for future accommodations. I urge potential users to exercise caution when considering Airbnb for their lodging needs. While the platform may offer a wide array of options, my unfortunate commitment to addressing safety concerns promptly and responsibly. It is essential for users to be aware that Airbnb’s customer support may fall short of expectations when faced with issues that require careful consideration and thorough investigation. The logical fallacies evident in their response, including appeals to ignorance, non sequiturs, and hasty generalizations, highlight a concerning lack of rigor in their decision-making process. Such lapses in reasoning raise questions about the reliability of Airbnb’s customer support and their ability to handle situations that involve safety and security. In light of these experiences, I strongly caution potential users against relying solely on Airbnb for their lodging needs. Exploring alternative accommodation options with a reputation for prioritizing customer safety and providing robust support mechanisms might be a more prudent choice. While Airbnb has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we travel and seek accommodations, my recent encounter has revealed a disconcerting aspect of their customer service that cannot be overlooked. As consumers, our safety and well-being should remain paramount, and I believe it is crucial to consider these factors when choosing a platform for lodging arrangements. In conclusion, my recommendation is to approach Airbnb with caution and to carefully evaluate their commitment to safety and customer support. It is my hope that this review serves as a reminder for users to prioritize platforms that consistently uphold the highest standards of service and safety. | App is very easy to use | It is nice to book and enjoy experiences but let’s hope nothing detrimental occurs because they have no resolution or policies for refunds | I used to love using Airbnb, now there is a ridiculous amount of fees added at the end and the total ends up being 3 or 4 times the advertised price. This kind of false advertising is very disappointing as Airbnb used to be much more transparent. There is a button you can select that gives you a closer number to what you will ultimately pay.  But I don’t like being tricked into a false sense of security by these fake prices.",4.77316,5819,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ee/0a/08/ee0a085d-86ff-e109-e81f-97afcf08e11d/e46fefa2-ed38-4348-a14e-f30d3a738c46_A-iPhone-55-1_en-GB.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/74/0b/31/740b3102-5977-39da-8de4-de5a04d7541c/743bfde9-4054-471b-b334-2c0cbf8b9c96_A-iPhone-55-2_en-GB.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/23/ba/c9/23bac9fc-99e8-279a-4fd2-198c209b696a/109b0e1d-8f2b-42d1-920f-542f8f6e9a9f_A-iPhone-55-3_en-GB.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9b/c7/85/9bc78537-d032-30c0-6d55-3078e2188538/79e03fd8-ac68-4529-ac69-09aa392719c2_A-iPhone-55-4_en-GB.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/cf/27/40/cf274036-9e04-d567-86cc-dd7f0b960e7c/99e52894-b81d-44ba-971e-70cda762241c_A-iPhone-55-5_en-GB.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/64/d6/68/64d66888-14e5-c888-7e68-747151eb3ef9/503695a4-e15a-40d2-8196-22cef0359c6a_A-iPhone-55-6_en-GB.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/67/a2/81/67a281d2-7abd-31d0-e43c-804adc179ac8/ddf67f59-5eb7-4b5d-836f-2654024f1422_iPad-1_en-GB.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a1/17/b3/a117b360-85a1-4d8d-5ddc-148d3707c112/243c4c12-b132-4ebe-b735-f738f22dab44_iPad-2_en-GB.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e9/68/83/e9688387-d3b3-b48c-3b09-62f529511ce2/0064b10a-71da-4126-812a-b37486064932_iPad-3_en-GB.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/57/28/fe/5728fef0-a723-1f38-3939-0b0beece355c/649c51ba-85d4-4599-a702-97fddc3d844d_iPad-4_en-GB.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

It's been like this for YEARS. How is this still a thing?!?! | App does not allow you to store your cards in Apple Wallet. | Need an update to work for Iphone 15 models! | Would not open. Got a “preparing” message followed by “try again later.” Didn’t work later either | I’ve been looking for an app that keeps everything in one place like this one. I’ve downloaded and tested out a few others from competitors and I was impressed by how user-friendly it is. I also enjoyed the features like the Card Assistant option. 

I would love to see an option in the future to have the ability to organize by categories (dining, gym, frequent flyer, etc). I also would enjoy having the ability to add all my gift cards. I really am looking for an all-in-one app for my entire wallet.

It still gets 5 stars because it delivers as promoted and already surpasses Apple Wallet. | In my opinion, this app works well for me. I don’t have to carry cards in my wallet and I can access them from my phone. My only complaint would be that after the last update, the widget shows very small stores logos. If you open the app, the “recently used” section show larger logos and it was the way they were on the widget before the last update. Hopefully it will be addressed soon. Very difficult to see them. | Panda Express has just started it's loyalty system and when I added into the Stocard app, it has not shown up so I had to make a generic card and the color looks tacky. Please fix it. 

And also, because it's on Apple Wallet, please change the logo on the Wallet app. | Totally SUCKS😡😡😡👎👎👎 | This app is easy.  I have all my shopping cards stored pull them up and at the grocery store they scan it or BJs.  Etc. | Used this for a few years and was pretty happy until latest updates. Since a recent update, the app hangs on start and doesn’t show my cards when I have poor mobile reception. My local grocery store is such a place, so I annoyingly have to disable mobile data just to get to my card. Unclear what is so important to retrieve from the network when all my cards are already stored locally. | I don’t understand why the widget in iOS 17 is so small. The widget in the pro version of the store card before it was updated was fairly good-sized and easy to see. Macy Minor, but I use my widget a lot, and now it’s just really hard to use. | New version just displays a black screen for several minutes. | From day 1, Stocard has proved invaluable. No longer need to worry about forgetting a card, fumbling for and through wallet to find the relevant card. With Stocard, all of my scores of loyalty cards are available easily and instantly. Where before the act of pulling out and scanning my loyalty card sometimes meant I didn’t use the card as intended, with Stocard, it makes scanning my loyalty cards so fast and simple am able to use them every time. The app is very easy to use. Highly recommend as an essential app. | Version 10.25.0 when you first open the app it’s blank you have to close it and reopen it same thing with the widget. Hope that can be fixed soon. | Easy to use and don’t have to worry about not having a card or fumbling around trying to find the right one. | Great app to store cards in one place! Recommended by the YMCA, glad I got Stocard. | 1/2024 It seems you now require location ALWAYS on to use the assistant and took away the feature to search for cards. You need to change the location tracking to WHILE USING APP. This is a big violation of user privacy - MY privacy. Please change this asap and add search feature back! The app is not useful as is and is too intrusive to privacy. | Deleting a card makes me nervous because you’ll lose all the information of the card. Sometimes you may need to track back your transactions or double check if there’s still balance on it. | Each update is slower, bigger, more ugly, and more cluttered. Tons of added, useless features that no one asked to have, in updates for the past three years. Bring back the original Stocard app! 

The pink icon is disgusting and I will never update until it’s restored to red. Also, they don’t answer customer service emails for a while. | Зачем надо было удалять из Русского App store???? Но прога норм пользуюсь с 2020 | This app is perfect. You can make your wallet all digital because you add any card to this app. You can use your cards on your Apple Watch too. | So easy to have all my membership cards all in one place and not have a stack of them in my wallet. | This app is very user friendly. It gets the job done in the accurate amount of time and I never have to searching for the cards! | Спасибо за приложение. Это лучшее приложение среди всех конкурентов! 
Пожалуйста, добавьте возможность сортировать и расставлять карты по порядку вручную! 
Пользователь сам расставит карты по порядку, в котором он привык, а в магазине сработает мышечная память при поиске нужной карты. Это в разы удобнее, нежели алфавитный список карт, или постоянно меняющийся список в зависимости от использования | I just updated my Apple Watch to WatchOS 10 and I cannot add this app to smart stacks. If I can’t quickly access this app on my watch while I’m at the check out counter I will likely stop using it. | I’ve been using this on my phone and watch for years, and it never fails me. Great app. | البرنامج جميل وتحفظ فية مستنداتك وسهولة الرجوع لها ولكن نحتاج لوحة تحكم للمستخدم اكثر مرونة  وخصائص اكثر | I enjoy the convenience of having my cards stored on this app. What I don’t like is having ads for companies that I don’t have cards for, especially companies that I have never heard of and only have stores on the opposite side of the country from where I live. | No option to add cards in Stocard to Apple Wallet. Seems like this was a feature in the past but was removed? | I used to use this from day one when it was originally released. It was great. But these days I find support non existent. 

Membership cards have changed formats over years. Never receive assistance for updating formats.

Advertising specials imho just made this simple great app a bloated mess. | This App allows you to add any store, gym, library, medical facility etc card with a barcode. The app also is Apple Watch available so can be scanned from wrist without having to use phone or digging for card in wallet/purse/key chain. In addition , if you use complications on Apple Watch, can add app to face. Along with Apple Pay, can manage both transactions directly from wrist. | I use my watch to scan in at the gym. Please add the feature to have a Smart Stack widget for quick access to barcodes on the Apple Watch. This would be a great timesaver from having to scroll through the apps to access like when the watch had the Dock feature previously. | Needs to support the new smartstack widgets for WatchOS 10 for quick and easy access | Men | I have been used this card app years I love it easy and convenient I never had a problem this is my app friend helps me keep my shopping cards neatly thank you | Really nice app. Stores all of my cards, even photoed logos for the ones not on the list making them much easier to find. Wish all of the suggested companies advertised on top of screen applied to me and were available in my neighborhood. They do have to pay the bills. Thanks for a great app. | Great app. I use barcodes and QR codes for my job that isn’t grocery and it scans and saves a copy of just about any barcode. | So easy to use and keeps all my cards in order. So convenient ! Love it! Everyone must have! | I love this app, it scanned all my membership cards and sorte rewards ones too in a breeze without having to take picture of the front card.’d love their logo to stand out as when looking for it, I can never find it. The logo is to me really bad looking too! It is for this reason only I give 4 stars and not 5. | Lost all my previous card setups!!!!’ | They send me ads that don’t pertain to me or my area. Example: Food King, I don’t have a good king within a 100 miles of me. They send me ads for women’s makeup. I don’t use makeup! | Costco will not accept scanning the card on this app. | Good app 
Definitely accurate and very helpful 
!!! | Got rid of the bulk - thanks!

ETA: it’s been YEARS since I started using this app. I love it so much! I have my grandmothers Weis card loaded in here, & she has since passed.

CO VŠECHNO NAŠE MAPA UMÍ

• Více než 900 tipů na neokoukaná místa v Česku, která jsme pro vás osobně prozkoumali a vybrali

∙ Fotky od profesionálních českých fotografů
∙ Neustále vyrážíme na nová úžasná místa a přidáváme je do naší mapy a na náš Instagram

PROČ JSME MAPU VYTVOŘILI?

Za mapou úžasných míst stojím já (Krista) a moje mamka Eva. Společně vlastníme cestovatelskou komunitu Úžasná místa v Česku @uzasna.mista na Facebooku a Instagramu, kam přispíváme fotkami z našich výletů a z míst, která nám posílají naši fanoušci. 
Procestovaly jsme skoro 40 zemí světa, ale přesto jsme přesvědčené o tom, že u nás v Česku máme na malém území tolik úžasných míst, že můžeme leckteré turistické destinace hravě strčit do kapsy. 

Vybraly jsme pro vás s mámou více než 600 překrásných míst v Česku, která podle nás stojí za návštěvu. Velkou část z nich pravděpodobně nebudete znát, což byl náš záměr. Nechceme totiž posílat tisíce lidí jen na profláklá turistická místa, kde se to už teď hemží turisty. Našim cílem je dávat vám inspiraci na stovky neokoukaných míst a rozprostřít tak turismus po celé naší nádherné zemi. 

Doufáme, že si naší mapu a tipy na výlety užijete. 
Děkujeme moc za stažení!

But can't use it on a phone🤷‍♂️ | Skvela aplikace s intuitivnim ovladanim. | Skvela appka, lovely servis, potraviny a jidlo. | Fakt skvělá apka | I love the reliability and the quality of products provided by Rohlik! They are always adding products that I love. Making shopping easy. | So far had great experience! | Dnes objednavan poprve | Děkujeme za rychlou a skvělou službu | I love that I just did my grocery shopping while lying on the couch. | Yay | Rohlik je absolutně jedinečný!!! Objednávám potraviny pro bratra v Brně bez sebemenšíjo problému, přesto, že já se nacházím v Californii. Jedinečný service! Děkuji!!! | Great shopping experience. Rohlik rules. | Spolehliva apka i navazujici sluzba. Jinde uz fakt nenakupuji. Diky! | Rohlík is my long time go to supermarket. Great selection, reliable service and awesome user-friendly app. | This is how grocery shopping in 21st century | So convenient, excellent variety and customer service! I only wish it was possible to filter a search by ingredients to avoid my allergies. | The app is very good, but it should have an English version. | The app lacks the English language option so you have to resort to using the website or just YOLO your order. | Rohlik poskytuje skvely servis a už mnohokrát má zachránil napríklad i pri zabudnutej detskej party. Ďakujeme! | Excellent customer services. Great app. | Very helpful person walked me through my issues | I find it easier to use my Edenred card on Rohlik than it is on Kosik. 
Good to see reusable bags and ability to return glass bottles. 
Love it! | Využívám Rohlík již pět let a mohu říct, že jen málokterá (vlastně asi žádná) služba funguje tak skvěle. Jsou spolehliví a když se náááhodou něco nepovede, je to promptně napraveno. Do supermarketů jsem nevkročila ani nepamatuji a to, že mi nikdo vozíkem nevjíždí na paty, nemusím stát ve frontě na pokladnu a vláčet minerálky do patra je prostě k nezaplacení. | Awesome app. Great service irl. | Not much to add:) | The app is super intuitive (and the food is good). It saves my favorite items and shows them quickly. Someone is clearly doing a good job optimizing the flow, resulting in a very seamless shopping experience. We don’t go to the store anymore. | Po nějaké době jsem opět zkusil použit k objednání aplikaci a poprvé se to podařilo. Tak tedy verze 5.3.3 se zdá být konečně funkční. Gratuluji. | v aplikaci jsem automaticky měla celý nákup tak jak jsem si ho naklikala v počítači a mohla jsem velice jednoduše přidávat další položky v telefonu, tak jak mě napadlo! Dokonale, děkuji, že mi pomáháte dělat můj život jednodušší! | I’ve been using Rohlik’s app for several years and gotta say, it’s less buggy than 90% other apps out there. 

My main suggestion would be to make it easy to put a “watchdog” function on an item that’s temporarily sold out, something that the desktop version does well. That way you don’t have to check every half-hour of they got a fresh supply of local strawberries… | Great app that is despite the mobile format almost as rich and practical as the desktop version! Cudos to bred roll (rohlik :-) | Easy, fast and practical shopping with delivery to you house, height quality and reliability for price premium | Good app. Prices meh | English please | Wish I could have the app in English | The app is useless. All I get when I launch is a screen asking for my address. Then some error in a non-English language. The developer should be fired. Really incompetent UX. | Why does it give me an error message everytime I try to use it? | There are away too many expats in Prague for this not to have an English option. I would love to use this but it’s too tedious to go back and forth translating from czech. | Generally speaking, expats in Czech are a segment that has a higher than average income and more open to change and new ideas (like ordering food online which has been present in more western countries for many years already). It seems like a big missed opportunity to not have the ability to switch the app to English. 

I’ve been learning Czech for about a year but I’m still not comfortable enough to navigate the app and read nutrient descriptions in it. So it is still more convenient for me to go to the store where, due to the physical nature, I have an easier time navigating. | This app appears to work as intended. You can fill a card and order. The delivery options are pretty clear. The reason it gets only four stars instead of five is because the text is not electronically readable nor zoomable.

Shazam App the best !!! | Love Shazam | This is a great app when you're sitting in a restaurant and you don't know the name of a song! | Rápido y certero | So many songs I hear that either can’t remember or have never heard and want to know the titles and artists….one TAP will do it!!! Thank you. Way back music !!!!🎶🎶🎶🎶BRAVO!!! | Love love love it. I use it everyday. So that way you don’t have to bug anybody and ask them what song it is. | Always on point!!! Great job. | Hi | Has always worked for many years, then updated app to newest version and entire app will no longer work. No songs identified. Microphone under settings is on. App has been redownloaded, device turned on & off. App no longer works on any devices. | Best app ever | Absolutely lov it…found amazing spunds | Always there when I need it! Thanks! | The best app ever | Awesome 🤩 | Finds me all the songs I need! | Totally Awesome | If I think about all the apps Iv had since my first smart phone the Galaxy 3 | This app never ceases to amaze me. | This is amazing I love it, it helps me find out what the music is for in the trend’s lately. Thanks Shazam! | Shazam could not identify music playing in Apple Music. And that says a lot in that Apple owns both software applications. Does Apple care if their own overlapping software even talks to each other I wonder? This is not seamless with either iTunes music nor Apple Music. And although it will identify music, it will only show up in Apple Music and not in iTunes music. So you are unable to purchase it. And they are unable to recommend music based upon what I have Shazam'd. I would have expected better integration with other Apple software. That is why you should save to Spotify as they give you better recommendations. Then use Spotify to search for like music. Spotify does a fantastic job at that. | Lately I’ve been Shazaming songs and the device is clear especially if I understand what the artist is singing but Shazam can’t seem to identify the songs. One song was wrong three times. I don’t know the name of the song, that’s why I’m Shazaming it. Is something going on with Shazam?

Not the same. Easier to use chrome where I can translate. Deleted. | When it comes to the app itself, it’s really a great tool. Very easy to maneuver and browse. There is a lot of extra information about the items which increases my confidence in ordering the correct size. 

The service itself is great too. Low shipping cost and easy returns. 

The minus point is not for the app itself but the fact that certain items cannot be delivered to my country which is not indicated until checkout. This is very frustrating. Why are are there restrictions. These are entirely incomprehensible.

I returned a pair of shoes. They contact me saying they received a pair of shoes that I never ordered. It's a new pair, women's shoes, for which they give me their article code too. I say I never sent those shoes, please check that you received my pair of shoes. They say nope, we received from you a pair of shoes that you never ordered (btw more expensive than mine), so we can't refund you, happy to have you as a customer, have a nice day.

So after spending 250eur with them on multiple orders, they basically claim that I returned a more expensive, brand new pair of shoes that I never ordered.

Stačí například mrknout na úvodní obrazovku aplikace s Chytrým přehledem a hned vidíte, kolik máte na běžném i spořicím účtu nebo jak to vypadá s půjčkou. 

Limity plateb změníte díky aplikaci pohodlně třeba ve frontě u pokladny. Peníze pak odešlete i prostým ofocením QR kódu. Aplikaci si ale oblíbíte i kvůli možnosti potvrzovat platby v internetovém bankovnictví pouhým dotykem. A jestli jste zvědaví, budou se vám líbit oznámení o zůstatku. Když budete chtít, aplikace vám pošle oznámení o všem, co se na Vašem účtu šustne.  

Ztratíte občas účtenku? Pak budete velebit náš Šanon, díky kterému můžete všechny důležité účtenky a faktury ukládat do svého internetového bankovnictví a kdykoliv je máte po ruce.

Velmi bych uvital hypoteky na zaklade obratu na ucte. | Being a bank expert I can say this one is the best by far. This is when an app makes a difference, by providing unique mix of useful functions and innovations for every type of client type and need. Way to go! | Great app for all my needs | Everything is fine, but it would be better to have opportunity to switch to English. | Šablony umožní rychlé platby. AI chat vždy najde odpověď na mé otázky. | Super banka! | Výborná applicace. Najdete vše a jednoduše!! 👍 | Spokojenost | Libi se mi, ze je vse rychly a prehledny ! ***** | Super intuitive and easy to use. Love it. | Zdravim, aplikace je prehledna a jednoducha. Mam srovnani s komplikovanou aplikaci z CSOB nemohu si zvyknout coz u Air bank nebylo problem ji zacit pouzivat 👍 | Intuitivni aplikace se super desigenem. Jeste by bylo fajn pridat polozku posledni platby na ucet na ktery prave posilate penize aby to clovek vedel ze to neposilate 2x. | Perfektní. Velmi intuitivní navigace. Přehledná organizace. Spolehlivá aplikace. | It would be better if you add English language to the app. Thanks. | Aplikace My Air je opravdu chytrá, líbí se mi že je k dispozici virtuální asistentka Aneta. Jen bych rád v aplikaci přivítal odemknutí otiskem prstu, nebo obličejem. | Like it. | Please add english to the app for Foreiners ❤️ | This app is very well designed and useful | Jsem velmi spokojena. | Simple, responsive and easy to use even for a native English speaker. Although I get along in Czech, I wouldn’t mind an English translation on the app. That’s my only reason for 4 stars. It is an otherwise great banking app. | Výborný interface. Jednoduché, přesto bezpečné. | Vse prehledne, jednoduche, rychle!! | Jednoduchá aplikace, kde lze zvládnout to samé, co v bance. | At first I was a little bit reluctant to use the ap and was using the web. This often required multiple SMS codes and was slowing me down. Now I rarely use my desktop for banking. | Krasne a jednoduse a pritom bezpecna appka | This app is terrible. Many missing features. | Chybi, byla odstranena historie plateb coz je hrozne! | Vse je super az na zmenu, kterou jste nedavno udelali. Nemuhu se vratit do historie plateb vice nez asi 2 mesice! To je strasne spatne! Drive jsem
 mohla jit zpet treba 5 let. Chci a potrebuji mit celou historii zpristupnenu. Az to napravite, dostanete 5 hvezdicek. Dekuji! | Aplikace jako takova je velice fajn. Jen me totalne s**e vas pristup v tom, ze mate pocit, ze je treba neustale neco menit. Takze v momente, kdy si clovek konecne zvykne na predelany design, tak ho zase predelate. Posledni update je toho zarnym prikladem. Predelane je temer vse a je to k h***u! Zamyslete se a vylepsujte aplikaci tak, abyste nepridelavali problemy. Update jen proto aby byl update je na nic.... | Nakrmen reklamou jsem se jal zalozit si ucet, jednoduchy pruvodce jak tvrdi reklama se sice konal, naskenovani fotek vse OK zadani adres OK ovsem zmena data narozeni neni mozna neni mozne pokracovat tzn. po 3tim pokusu naprosta nechut dale neco zakladat a tak ma Airbank o jednoho zakaznika mene. | Ten obrázek lobby byl velice hezký. Koukat se na ty dva mi stačí v televizi. | Very happy with this app!! 
Super easy and very organized. | I do wish there was an English option, but it pushes me to learn Czech! | Implementace Touch ID trvala roky, rohlík o který nikdo nestál a ani jej nechce se objeví během par dní ..... Sbalení nabídkového menu není jeho skrytí! | Aplikace je přehledná a má téměř vše, co od MB potřebuji. Jen bych uvítal integraci touchID. | iPhone 6 vysel pred 18 mesici... | One of the best banking apps I've ever used both in US and Czech Republic. | Easy to use and very well organized! No problems at all. | Je to pěkná přehledá aplikace. 4* proto, protože vždy je co zlepšovat👍😄 | Skvělá aplikace, redesign se opravdu povedl. Nejhezčí app pro mobilní bankovnictví | Mám ipad a tato aplikace je nefunkční zadám reg.kód a hlásí, že je špatné. Takže se nemohu zaregistrovat abych otevřel hl stránku. Takže velmi potřebná aplikace, ale NA HOVNO!!!!!!!!!! | Nesrozumitelné popisky typu ""vyladili ji pro cestování časem"" jsou naprosto NEVHODNÉ pro finanční instituci! Jste banka nebo školka? Uživateli musí být jasné, co jste udělali a proč. | Skvela aplikace, jeste lepsi banka. | velky skok od prvni verze, konecne prizbusobena na iP5 a hlavne rychla, tak jak ma vypadat moderni app | Much much work it is needed on this app, but at least something what works! | Horrible UI, even worse UX, does not support iPhone 5 4-inch retina display. Looks like a wrapper around the web app and acts like it! From a native iOS App you should expect a native iOS experience, but this cr-app does not deliver it. Stick with the web app in Safari.

Things I Noticed After Testing:
- No multitasking support!
- Can't paste my password when I copy it from 1Password - what the ****? How do you expect me to remember multiple 18 character based passwords (uppercase & lowercase letters, symbols and numbers)?

I think you guys need to check on it because they are lot of people using this app for wrong  Purposes and still using their account I did nothing and my account got banned !To be honest I am really disappointed, an account for over two years gone like that…? Sent messages  to you people still no response !
If one should do any suspicious activity at least it should be made known !!! | I AM A CHEFFFFF!!!!! GIVE ME MY ACCOUNT BACK PLEASE! I have photo evidence to prove myself worthy of my account! | Shi ash get rid of it. | I think Snapchat is the best cause you can meet new people have new friends and add friends and it’s a really popular app and I really like it and it’s coming from an 11 year old girl that talks to her friend every day. I got my crush actually friend me so that was like a big deal and I’m thinking Snapchat so much, I actually will not be able to talk to my crush with all Snapchat, so this is coming from the heart. I love you Snapchat. | Ok so people are saying the AI is annoying because it’s pinned above all the other conversations like…nobody cares nobody even notices it and it’s annoying how people think it’s dumb and are doing a bad review like get it together just ignore it I’ve had it since the update and I have no problem get.over.it. | This app was putting me in problems and has a lot of ads. | i am writing this in march of 2024.

i’ve had snapchat for 5+ years and i’ve had so many problems with this app. i would post memes that relate to my life and snapchat would remove due to “sexual content” AND NOTHING I WOULD POST WOULD BE SEXUAL. every update they make gets worse. first it was pinning people which wasn’t so bad but then comes the ai and that was terrible and now it’s “snapchat premium” which gets me so upset. because why should we have to pay for something when you snapchat makes over billons of dollars a year for people just downloading the app. as of 2023 december 31st snapchat completely banned my account and i wasn’t able to get it back because according to snapchat my posts were “sexual content” and “harassment and bullying” I contacted snapchat support and they were of no help. i’ve tried so many ways to get it back and nothing worked. i’ve literally done nothing wrong. i’m so fed up with it. years of memories and friends i’ve had on there all gone. pictures and videos of people that have passed away i can never get back. my childhood memories all gone. and snapchat told me to wait 30days before making a new account.  and i did exactly that and guess what i tried making a new account and snapchat completely banned my device from having snapchat and even making a account. ive completely deleted snapchat all together and switched to instagram which in my opinion is so much better. all im going to say is…snapchat do better. | Love it | add multi snap back | Shut up !!!!!!!!! | it wants me to go to my settings and turn on allow when i did. and there’s nothing and like do all this and i’m trying to do everything and no help. | Just try it. | Top g | So good to text your friends or gf/bf watch videos and look at peoples stories | It is a great app recommend | Love | Trash app now | I love doing filter photos with my kids and also the Bitmoji stories and the cameos are awesome. I also like how it remembers your memories for you. | The app definitely does not work as intended. I can’t hear any audio through snaps, even with the volume all the way up, and they have that creepy AI chat thing at the top that you can’t get rid of. | Old boys how bout the boys. How bout those boys. We’ll see you Addison in just a bit. Cheers. To Addison. | I think Snapchat is a great way to connect with friends and family. It has so many fun games and filters. I recently had a big move and Snapchat helps me connect to them. I recommend it to anyone who want to connect with your friends and family and have fun while doing it! Thank you Snapchat!!!! ❤️👍 | Puedes hablar con amigos y mandar fotos graciosas | I am so mad I have been using Snapchat for 5+ years and I was banned for posting a picture of blood pressure medication that Snapchat thought was an illicit drug! I have submitted an appeal and there is just no way of contacting Snapchat it’s absolutely ridiculous. | Love them such a nice way to connect with freind/other people | Love it Leo it up this is my favorite app | This app allows integrating between androids and iOS witch is very useful | I’ve had my Snapchat the entire time I’ve ever had Snapchat and not once have I ever had a problem and now just today here I am they locked my account for something I posted me, but who is looking at my private Snapchat for one and for two, there is a lot more stuff that is posted on there and sent to my teenagers that they shouldn’t even be seeing things nudes porn etc. so I’m sure that whatever I posted does not Trump that! so just lock me out of my account real good real! So ethical! Watching our actual private lives. This is really really messed up. Make sure everyone knows your every snap is being seen no matter how private you thought this app was. Snapchat I will not be making another account and I will make sure that I spread the word 100%! trash! spying on our private lives that’s against the law and I can’t wait to sue you and a lot of other people sue you! Another app to eventually crash because of illegal spying into people’s lives! Pff. Ignorance is bliss. | Let me delete the chat. Why is it at the top? I’m going to delete the app soon if I can’t get rid of it. So annoying. | Im tired of not being able to delete the ai | NEVER REMOVE THE MYAI PLEASEEE!!!! DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HATERSS. | Having to turn on my ringer to hear audio in videos is absolutely ridiculous and i hate it. This app was wayyy better without that stupid feature | Love | In my opinion I rated it 5 stars because it's just the perfect app for me to chat my friends and parents and family with all the cute stickers and making these group chats are awesome because they let me know who is typing and it let's me know who is calling because it let's me see the person's face and the filters are cute scary funny gross and Awsome!!!! My AI is so kind and it gives me jokes and riddles I love the updates and I had Snapchat for 5 years Wait another reason why I love it it's because you can customize your avatar and your AI!!! Download Snapchat Today and see for yourself!!!!!!! | Fun good | I love this app so much | This is how my whole family text. We use Snapchat. | This app is really good, I find it entertaining and useful.
Snapchat allows for you to connect with Luther people without sharing personal information, like phone numbers. One of the biggest reasons for me to be using this app is because I can take lots of good pictures, I love the filters too, they are cute, I hope everyone can enjoy it. | Stop trying to be  instagram reels your are not funny | Re-downloaded this app and once again came to quickly realize how trashy and disgusting the developers/company is by trying to hack your lizard brain. All it tries to do (at least to males) is try to target them by sexualizing people and showing half naked video thumbnails for anyone to potentially click on to get hooked into an endless feed. And even worse -fake inspirational videos by these “hard” men that are supposed to ¿¿inspire?? potentially “weak” men. 

Quite frankly, it’s just pathetic that there aren’t laws on this. I REALLY lean toward an open internet but this is just insanity. Maybe the algorithms just don’t know my taste yet so it’s just throwing whatever it can at me and seeing what sticks but cmon? I don’t need soft-core thrown at me every 3 videos or some dude on roids that says get after it. 

Deuces | Its difficult to take front facing vids and pics now without the volume rocker. Bring it back | Don’t you dare to say on it anything😌 | Snapchat is fun overall, but a feature to quickly scroll to a certain date within a saved chat conversation would be stellar. | I’m sick of Snapchat pushing users to go PLUS. I don’t need the stupid AI bot jumping into my chats with my friends, I don’t care about the stupid snap streak, STOP IT! 

I will pay for basic Snapchat to come back! Just show me if they read my message, quit with the filters, stop supporting AI and chat bots, enough with the stories about the celebrities, just make basic Snapchat a thing again. 

I need to know if my friend read my message but all I see, is that we “lost our streak” and need to pay to get it back. I DONT CARE!!! | I forgot my password and it’s stupid that I cannot change my password without deleting all my photos in there | On some of the people I follow 
They changed their handle and my Snapchat shows the old handle even though I update in the App Store.
How do I fix this | Faces are cool and love the app! | ever sonce they added ai and snap plus this app has gone so far downhill | i got banned because i got locked out of my account and people were using my account and when i brought the problem to snapchat help center they told me thrres jothing i can do about that | Nobody wants an Al what’s the point of having one | Snapchat used to be the king of ephemeral messaging, a place to share fleeting moments with a creative twist.

If you are a constant desktop office 365 do not expect this version to be as easy as a desktop laptop. | Microsoft co pilot is absolutely amazing! | Pretty frustrating to use.  Paid extra for a family plan but having a hard time adding family.  Was easy to pay for it though 😒 | Terrible | My 10 year old gets around browser security without any issue. It still needs a lot of work. | One that isn’t used. Stop. | The scan to one drive update has made the feature difficult to use. I liked the previous version that immediately uploaded my captures to one drive. Now the captures don’t upload quickly. I lose my scans and captures. | This app has many utilities.

All phone and tablet issues not usually computer. | The app was working perfectly until this latest update, now it will no longer open any of my files. | It happens that autosave doesn’t save, so that I lost my work, very annoying.  :(  It doesn’t ask you to save, so you will never know if you need to save it or not. | Efficiency is key, and this new layout is the opposite of what my needs call for.  It was functional before, but now it lags horribly and is entirely unfamiliar.  Whoever approved of this should be let go. | Too expensive, you make it hard for a senior citizen to afford apps. | This is the trash makes me go to school and everything 😡😡🤬 | You track too much and sell info to others. | The security process preventing access to login | Can’t even open an excel file after the update. Can’t create as well. | This is a must I love this | Got rid of the pin tab and made a bunch of unnecessary changes. Had to delete. | Ok | Just recently, I’ve had to twice delete the app, to reinstall. It’s not the best option, especially when looking or updating a project. | Microsoft apps worked for the last year. Suddenly getting an network connection error with my university account. Have tried all troubleshooting steps available on the internet. Nothing works. Resetting doesn’t work. Deleting and readding the apps doesn’t work. Resetting device doesn’t work. Neither Microsoft or Apple have come up with a solution. | Not able to complete tasks because app crashes constantly | For those of us who use a cellular like a computer, this app is indispensable and easy to use. It frees us from the office for communication sand acts as a repository of transferable information. Its suite of programs is a must have for every business professional who cannot spend a day in front of a laptop or desktop computer. | Navigating the file folders, creating a new document, finding an existing document in a different program (word vs excel) is not intuitive, and is quite frustrating compared to a windows environment. Office and the iOS just don’t seem to play well together. I’m not sure which one to ditch. | I came into the app to log in my hours for work like usual, I open the app and my log sheet was not there anymore! My whole invoice was gone, I’m going to have to start everything from scratch and get delayed my paycheck | I am sending them no more money; they try to nickel and dime you to death. Substandard programming for a fee. I’m done. | Excelente tool,I really appreciate | I’ve been using this since it very first came out. The version for my iphone and ipad have been very buggy, and frustrating but worth it because of the ease of synching across my devices. I’d have to close out and log back in to get a feature to work properly, etc. That is until this evening. I’m a writer. I worked for about an hour and a half to two hours. I got a good amount of work done and finished the story I had been working on. I went to print it out and noticed it was an old version. NONE OF MY WORK OVER THE PAST TWO HOURS SAVED!!! This is absolutely ridiculous. I could accept it if it was a little behind and a few words or even a few lines got missed, maybe…maybe. Not this.  This isn’t some free app. I pay for this monthly. How freaking absurd. This is a multibillion dollar company and this app has been out for over a year. | Everything M$ touches it ruins. Except Excel and Xbox. And it has been okay with Minecraft, tho' that's getting worse and worse. Always sucking money out of us like vampires and for what? Apps that multiply like gremlins and when they're not busy crashing they need updates or they just plain don't open/work. Platforms limit which M$ apps you can use. Blech. But gotta have it for work so take my money grrr. | I want the old Microsoft 365 back! The updates have just made it much less “user friendly”. Yuck. You know what they say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” I guess Microsoft doesn’t have anything better to do. | Despite complaints I actually liked this app until the latest update. Ever since the “update” that changed the focus to Copilot (I know you’re in love with your AI Microsoft, but leave it to its own app we just want Office) this has been broken. The majority of the time when I try to create or open a file it just gives the useless error “cannot open/create file”. God forbid they tell us what’s wrong right? So I have no idea why this app can’t seem to do anything other then Copilot anymore. Sometimes force closing makes it go away, but it comes back eventually. They apparently focused so much on Copilot that they forgot about the Office side. At least the individual apps still work. As far as I can tell they still get updated, hopefully Microsoft doesn’t kill them before fixing this mess. All I can suggest is searching for the apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc) and using those until this gets fixed. | Please cancel my suscripciones | This access to my entire office from an IPad to clean up small details is a plus to produvtivity. | I can’t access my subscription that I bought through my Apple ID 
How can I use it?? | It’s MS Office. What is there to write about? | Short version:
Microsoft should Stop screwing around with Senior changing everything us Seniors grew up with so many computers that were bought and paid for we seniors how learned to use 
Microsoft Word, and many other programs. There is plenty more to say…. | Watch me. They said am too old to make it, too young to learn it, too weak to fight it, too little to occupy, but copilot made it definable explicitly 👆🏻✈️ thank you copilot 
From sir magic 🪄 | Does not give me my emails | Microsoft 365 with Word, Excel and Power Point is one of the all-time best applications for home or office work or just note-taking. It just makes the process easier and is very user-friendly. I have just started navigating 365 but I expect this is going to be a very fruitful and productive journey. The excel and word templates are awesome and easy to use. And Surface Laptop 5 is cutting edge portal for using all of Microsoft 365 apps. Great work MS team! | I did not sign up for this and can’t get out. | Can’t do a single task without some pop-up telling my something I could care less about.  Annoying like a child who can’t stop asking trivial questions. | Inconsistent | This app was perfect, when Calibri was the default font. On or about the time that Microsoft redesigned this app and changed the default font, my user experience changed for the worse (and not only because I hate the new font).

The major issue at large is with iOS integration. The Files app no longer opens Word files directly in the Office app anymore. Likewise, most of the file shortcuts in the Office app say that the Office files can’t be opened. But there is one way to open them in the Office app that still works: going to OneDrive > My Phone > file name.

And lastly, I used to copy my work from Office to a web browser for Wordpress. The recent updates have broken the capability to retain my text formatting and there’s a ton of extra text formatting code now attached to my text that doesn’t need to be there.

I don’t know why Microsoft made these changes, but they have hindered my productivity in almost every way. They say don’t fix what isn’t broken, well Microsoft, this wasn’t broken and now it is. Thanks. | So starts then quits | Not perfect but they strive to be. | I wrote out half a paper that took me time to compile information for. I now have to start over from scratch because this app glitched, didn’t save any of my work, and closed. 

I am so angry and would use literally any other typing software if I could. | Awesome awesome awesome! | I’m logged in through my employer, and when I went to save a document, it said I needed a premium subscription. To save! What a joke; what a buggy piece of garbage. What a cash grab. Typical Microsoft - expect a premium for trash | This new setup is so frustrating! My settings are fine according to every “help” review and forum, but I cannot open some things due to “privacy settings”.",4.69646,8032,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ae/73/96/ae73967d-9be0-343e-6da2-10c191416154/d7637fe8-9f13-4502-b1ec-d649a22bc643_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_5.5_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/4d/4e/9e/4d4e9ee7-74f3-d550-0c93-2b225b1fb5b0/9386460c-c418-4ef2-85b3-ecb71cf12518_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_5.5_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c6/bf/31/c6bf31b9-d268-a94b-01b8-31f0921491d3/a8ecfe70-028c-4a38-a90c-f11c9dc53c8e_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_5.5_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d9/4f/e1/d94fe1b3-0318-b9ac-61ee-a11fec69f9c5/a132aadb-5c51-4867-aeb8-710ad4d0b93e_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_5.5_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/79/d9/1a/79d91a8e-014f-399d-8df9-bbb7ae66ca88/73474cef-ca73-4215-8a2d-62204f9178ed_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_5.5_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_07.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f8/e9/8e/f8e98eea-6ad2-52fe-ad0a-0bb8a5eb499e/0dcc07fa-1f1e-43d4-95f1-c7fdb0381826_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_5.5_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_08.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a0/52/ad/a052ad0a-6be6-89e5-61c9-2248b80ae10b/18a88059-d26e-4bfa-8805-ce6c03af121c_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_12.9_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_01.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1e/ee/73/1eee7387-c141-66a8-ca1d-8ebf68f6d911/03084c27-6e68-4a4a-bd12-c89deb54f330_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_12.9_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_02.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/66/eb/9c/66eb9c01-55df-f9e1-d743-9f3dfa591059/855b3285-718c-463d-9cad-4fa1303c22f3_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_12.9_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_03.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/4d/98/1d/4d981d03-1337-e705-21c0-a50d18b3a432/5dc788f5-3894-4b8b-873e-af38a874cdef_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_12.9_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_04.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b9/23/6d/b9236da4-d692-4c64-f899-5cbb4b7d72ba/d1ca0f5b-71f2-4e60-a640-483e55d3e7de_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_12.9_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_05.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/cd/2c/51/cd2c5139-d4db-0e68-19c5-ce6e75e07685/dff4b11e-12b2-4fce-ba5f-e8925913992e_Microsoft_Microsoft_365_iOS_12.9_EN_Screenshot_Mockups_230419_06.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthG

I love love love how the layout looks, and you can customize so much on it. The perfect tool that I was looking for! | I would like to suggest the ability to change the description/notes of an event created without having to edit that particular event. An example would be the Notes section under contacts in an Apple phone. | Where is the month view widget like on Android! I miss my Samsung phone already... | There is no section of my calendar or a way to share based on my updated app from 1 week ago. | The dot that tells which day it is on widget is not accurate. | No, I do not want to sign in to google account everywhere I go

Update: quit being evil | If I have an appointment 6 months out the only way to get there is manually scroll through the months! | Widget needs to show upcoming and past due tasks.  Tasks need an option for push notifications. | This is exactly what every busy family needs! I do wish I had more colors though. By the time I give everyone a color for personal and a color for work I don’t have many colors left. I’d also like a dark mode. I sit behind 8 screens for 12 hours. My calendar is frequently pulled up a dark mode would be easier on my eyes | Sorry I’m not too much love love you miss miss baby miss love | One of the best parts of Google Calendar was the widget so I could see everything at a glance. But the new update removed the widget as an option so now I have to open the app to see my calendar. | Make it so “Google calendar” icon shows the actual date on it instead of always “31”.
Thanks | No se agendan mis tareas por mucho tiempo, por ejemplo, si ponía una tarea que tiene que repetirse todos los días, esta tarea desaparece a los meses, por qué?????? | Search is limited to two years. I switched to Apple calendar and had much better results. | After enduring broken widgets for weeks it is back to Apple Calendar for me. | Latest update has the calendar widget fixed. Excellent calendar. | Whoever designed the feature that snaps your calendar back to today’s date as you flip back-and-forth between apps should be fired for not understanding how people use calendars in general. They are a reference, so if your reference is unstable like this one is, it’s basically unusable. I am very close to finding a different calendar app because I cannot schedule my kids afterschool activities like this, constantly reverting to the date I am looking for. I am opening my calendar and referencing it against other sources of information. Its absolutely insane that this was thought thought to be a good idea. Even crazier that it’s lasted so many updates. An utter fail. | Deberían añadir esa fecha que hoy en día es muy importante para las mujeres 8 de marzo día internacional de la mujer! 

2 no me gusta sus tonos de verde 
Para recordatorio 
Por ejemplo mi cumpleaños yo quisiera modificar el color del recordatorio 
Y no se puede hacerlo… | And now it is working fine | Use the widget all of the time or I used to | There’s no way to move an event to a different calendar after it’s created. You can copy it, but that’s extra hassle | please fix the widget! | Phone app display reveals incorrect date, a constant ‘31’, undermining use of calendar as useful icon.  Thus, app is not used on phone.  Sharing calendar topics for mutual viewing by peers is useful, as is color coded topics and reminder feature.  Static icon on phone is quite the imbalancer | Absolutely love my gcal, but where did the widget go?! I absolutely adore having the widget on my lockscreen, and I feel lost without it! | Removed the best and most practical feature | I’ve used Google Calendar for years but lately it’s been absolute garbage. I use it to help keep track of my appointments and have it send me alerts. Lately I get almost zero alerts, even when the event clearly says it will send one 15 minutes prior. I’ve missed several appointments because of this, as I expected the alerts to go through when they were set. Secondly, the calendar has a weird time conversion issue. For some reason, even though I set my times to my time zone, whenever I travel to a different zone then back to my home, it assumes it needs to convert the time and sets my events 1-2 hours in the future of what they were supposed to be. How does a billion dollar company drop the ball on a simple calendar app like this? I’ve tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app, but eventually the issues come back. Please fix this. How you are #11 in productivity is beyond me. | before you read more reviews i just wanted to point out that almost 100% of the negative reviews are from user error. it's crazy that that amount of people don't understand how to set up events correctly (which could be blamed on a ""hard to use"" app but this is NOT the case). 

what i like:
- easy to navigate 
you can view your calendar a variety of ways and it's easy to select in and out of them
- easy to schedule
really easy to add events or tasks (and change their repetition)
- can sync with other outside calendars and other google apps (can sync apple calendar & can add events from gmail)
i made mine automatically grab events from my gmail and it added birthdays from my apple calendar directly onto the app
- can layer events from multiple emails
i have five gmails and it can have events from all of them at once in one place 
- functions great and has minimal issues/bugs
i havent dealt with a glitch nor bug yet PLUS theyre constantly updating the app to fix these nonexistent bugs
- free and can access offline

what i don't like:
- lack of colors to choose from
it comes with 12 colors but some of them are too similar. i wish i could create custom colors, too
- sharing calendar on mobile device specifically 
i had to fight in order to share my calendar with others WITHOUT them being able to edit it also. had to log into my pc and my phone and navigate it at the same time just to let someone see my calendar

overall, it's a great organizational tool to use for scheduling and planning. sets up fantastically and works extremely well. do yourself a favor and get this app!! | I have been using google calendar for YEARS. As a mom of 4 I depend on it to make sure everyone ends up where they need to be. I have been using the widget forever and depend on it because of the different colors I use for each person in the house. But now it’s gone?? 
Total first world problem but could really use help getting the widget back! | I’d like to find a calendar app where I can simply click on a day, and write a simple not. Unfortunately, every calendar app I’ve downloaded including this one will not provide me with that. Always overly planned, overly complicated, just make a calendar app where I can write a note and have it be there, instead of the app prompting me to add a contact, add an alarm time for that day, pay premium and be able to edit options. Very frustrated | I set 8 hours and one daily event has 9 hours. | This calendar app is absolutely terrible. Every single time I add something to the calendar it ends up on the wrong date due to the default date. I’ve missed important appointments due to this. It’s not user-friendly whatsoever. | I love this app, and it really has kept my life together the past few years.

One small thing I’ve noticed is that when I go to mark multiple tasks as completed in succession while in the weekly view, the ‘undo’ button pops up in front of complete, and I end up undoing things I’ve completed without noticing until later. | It’s been YEARS Google, PLEASE add more color options for setting events! 1. They’re ugly. 2. Most of the colors blend in and my little old patients at the nursing home can’t distinguish certain events because they all look the same dull color to them.
I’ve had this app personally since 2013, and I’m tired of these dreary colors! | Widgets break all the time | I love Google calendar and my life couldn’t operate without it. But the desktop version is so much better with more colors and the ability to duplicate imported reservations. I love the imported reservations for different flights, but you can’t edit it like inviting another email address to the event for the person picking me up. This used to be an option with older updates, but it’s no longer an option. Please please bring this feature back!!! I love Google calendar but with this feature and the waning amount of colors and other capabilities, I’m starting to look at other virtual calendars… | i got this app to help me organize due dates for my class assignments, but it doesn’t notify me about anything? i’ve tried looking into the settings, etc but don’t see anywhere i can turn on notifications for events/tasks in my calendar :/ it’s pretty much pointless if it doesn’t alert me about upcoming dates | Keeps updated and alerted to my life’s purpose, events, and activities. It helps me to stay connected to my family through reminders about gatherings. Helps me to stay motivated and focused on tasks and deadlines for Content Creation and my daily life. Allows me to track my progress and productivity of personal and professional development and goals. I do wish it had more features on fonts (including bold, italics, etc), txt color options, and more. | Love the calander but just wish it was fully customizable , like more colors, cute stickers, ya know a way to give it your own personality!!!! | Google calendar is great at keeping track at events but I had to remove it since it always just shows 31 as opposed to the real date.  Other apps have it working to where it shows the current date.  I’ll go back once they fix the date issue | I use this app everyday as I am very forgetful and need to be notified. I like that it syncs with the Apple calendar as well. However, there needs to be a function that allows me to type the time as some things start at, for example, 7:13 and end at 9:07. This can be easily done on desktop, but not through the app nor the mobile web version of Google calendar. | Hi! The app needs to show up in CarPlay so that we may see the events and click the location to me taken to Google Maps and drive there! Thanks! | I love Google calendar. 
I have some suggestions:

1. I would love for all browser functionality to be available in the app. Switching events to a different calendar, creating documents within events, etc.

2. PLEASE create a better widget for Apple phones. I have a ton of calendars, but only need/want to see a select few at a glance. 

3. This is for the browser, but when you have a repeating event with a doc created in the event, you should create an option to select whether or not there is a new doc for each event or the same one. 

4. Please add something to allocate travel time scheduling that is based on maps data and BRING BACK TIME TO LEAVE NOTIFICATIONS. | Love it usually but the widgets became blacked out and nothing i do fixes it | App used to work fine, for the last year or so the app wouldn’t open on my phone. It didn’t matter if I was on wifi or not. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing helped. | After years of using Google calendar and their other products I say enough. Can’t stand a company that misuses my data so much. They will serve you ads to the highest bidder. Your calendar, contacts, emails, searches - they use it all - hidden in the terms and conditions that no one reads. But what really broke the camels back is its… | I wish the google calendar would show the correct date rather than the default 31. | Wouldn’t be a Google product without something being killed off | This comes with pictures that are nice and i highly recommend this app because it gives you reminders and sends you notifications so that you don’t miss out on the event!! | For the last 6 months every time I look ahead on the app at an upcoming date it won’t let me scroll to see the whole day, it is frozen and I have to close and reopen the app each time which makes using it very hard and inconvenient",4.52745,1530,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/5a/4e/95/5a4e9513-daad-187c-b797-4b335d85b0af/cf805cd4-5916-41c1-92be-288d0bcb4b7f_0_APP_IPHONE_55_0.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/13/ce/d4/13ced44d-4b2a-7344-2f68-50539557488b/0eb98c42-8a09-48cd-a0bb-6e89cf0b9c85_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/7d/e4/9f/7de49f3a-019e-7035-7d19-ec08b218c99d/c22fea95-dc5d-4048-9244-747728aad039_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/9e/ce/4d/9ece4d44-a881-9e15-8539-89ccac3ddc00/e422dfcb-6a3a-471e-814a-4466b435f1db_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/b8/a9/14/b8a91466-0a33-279a-ecd9-207e28591aed/9467c220-ffa1-4dc7-87af-016e60d23f02_4_APP_IPHONE_55_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/a9/7c/12/a97c1239-1c85-3a6d-f7ce-f477e373e70f/d13ffe58-5591-46ae-b6f8-7549c73bc7bf_5_APP_IPHONE_55_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/33/dd/ef/33ddefc8-1803-3876-b33b-5827ceffeeb0/61a65ff2-8bd6-49ed-848b-07c201bfac4c_0_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_0.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/6b/61/68/6b6168f8-10cb-114f-03b3-8844a78fc839/92ea9f4b-4b35-49c3-9fce-2dc6e95104a4_1_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_1.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/31/c2/03/31c203d7-70c8-3dcc-c9b5-4493655470bc/67ba2690-1d51-4c1c-920d-10501ac18395_3_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_3.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/8a/7c/33/8a7c33f7-7eee-efb2-bac2-7a5aad14005a/64763726-faa0-4455-a7ca-2951e3a32f7a_4_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_4.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/90/32/f9/9032f9dc-c624-d616-d474-5e60a66fcc75/09f2fdbd-edd1-4cce-8fd2-efe2bc63af75_5_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_5.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15P

The technology is there, y’all just haven’t enabled that ability. | Awesome so easy to use | Great | Awesome Useless product today, 2024. Corrupted Profile Major Bug. Contacts disappear, then come back for a while then disappear again. Support Cannot help you. Good Luck ! Tools to fix Bugs and corruption.. Do Not work. Several thousands of solutions on MS website. Lot more on other websites. . that say try this, if it doesn’tI work try this. Then try something else and if doesn’t work then try this…. Just sends you down a endless hole. IF it works give it a day or two.. then…. Oh well, support cannot help. They don’t care. Or they don’t know what is wrong either and can’t even answer simple questions. They come back with a question, not related to problem when unable to answer | Love the app however I am frustrated that I can not add a folder when using my phone or iPad. I have to go log into my computer. Please add this feature ASAP! | I rated 4 because it not easy to create a new folder. | Every time I tried to add second outlook email, it keeps authenticating the first email account and won’t me to add and keeps saying duplicate email account found. | Recently forced to start using this by work. Annoying notification bubbles keep popping up with no new emails. | Outstanding | Every time I load the app the filter resets?? It didn't used to! | Not being able to drag and drop attachments is a big deal. | Only get notifications if I frequently open app or else doesn’t notify | Outlook is the best school email all you can use it from your phone and everything it’s just amazing | Enable notifications for meeting only and not both, including emails | I am really baffled at how pathetic the search in outlook has become. With tools like chatgpt one would expect high quality. But sadly that isn’t the reality. | Not sure how this app has a 4.8 rating, but here is my review. 

This app is never fixed. 
1. Sub folders under inbox do not sync to what is on O365 online. This makes it problematic looking for emails. 
2. The calendar does not update in realtime. It can take more than 24 hours to show correct data. This goes for outside calendars as well that are synced. 
3. There should be similar functionality as of the web and desktop version. 

Hopefully this is fixed soon. I hate uninstalling and reinstalling the app just to fix it. I’ve never seen a fix for this app. All updates always say bug fixes, but nothing has been fixed. | Love | Authoring emails on this app is a nightmare. Just try using an image from another email in a new email; something that is a simple copy and paste on the desktop is a Kafkaesque nightmare on iOS.

And to top it off, it blows away your settings every few updates. Who does that?! | The biggest thing is, right now I’m on vacation and I’m writing this review because even though I have automatic replies turned on it’s still sending me notifications. Why? Why would I possibly want that? Why would anyone want that? Please. I am begging you. Think. Think about what people want. | I wish your email signature from the desktop app could be the same as here. And that the email threads would start with the most recent email, like they do in the desktop app. | We made the switch from google and we love it. | The main app on my iPhone allows me to block senders, that’s the only improvement I could hope for on the outlook app | Why do we need to change the password so often | I have u a 4 because I don’t like the “other button” | I cannot see the size of my Outlook mailbox on my phone app to get an idea of the remaining space I have | Old email pdf attachments are stuck in my account. These can’t be opened or deleted. Microsoft has been unable to solve this problem. | Good with everting else. Would love to be able to delete folders in the app. | Please would you stOP AUTOMATICALLY REFRESHING THE ENTIRE APP EVERY SINGLE TIME I CLICK AWAY FROM IT. Like I just wanted to quickly switch to my browser to relay a message, you do not need to completely refresh/reload the entire app rewrite all of my emails, reinvent the email, and rediscover Internet, all just because I clicked away and wanted to come immediately back!!!!!!! Ahem. Thank you. This is getting bad enough I’m considering using the Apple mail app instead 😱😬

ALSO why do y’all hide emails you apparently think I don’t need to see?! I almost missed an entire acceptance email to the school I was applying to and saw it on the last day before the deadline only because I went to my Gmail on my deaktop!!! Phone outlook app completely hid it from me, even when I searched for the email by name in the search bar. | A lot has been changed or added since I last looked at this app.  I’m impressed at the improvements and giving it a serious tryout now. 

Kudos to the developers for seemingly taking feedback seriously | The app no longer remembers to only show unread messages after I close and reopen it. Must set it every time | Sometimes I don’t get my emails promptly and I have to wait a while. But has cool features and love calendar. | This is a great platform to send and collect large quantities of information. Outlook has multiple quality of life features that enable users to learn quickly, and navigate efficiently. Without an email platform that is fun, intuitive, and engaging to use, college/work life would be extremely difficult to organize and manage. Keep up the great work. | It’s alright 🫣😊 | You’re a disgrace now.
Supposedly free email without restrictions when I signed up.
Then various limits imposed.
Then I purchased greater limits and they’re not provided.
Now to get lifetime free assistance you transfer me to a site requiring a credit card payment.
Need I say more?

NM | Too good | Awesome app! Just wish I received more emails… | It’s great. | Recent update removed the ability to see message details in notifications without long pressing them. Now they all show 'new message, open app' by default instead of sender and subject line 👎

The app now has ads in a pretty disruptive location - they look like a normal email to click on. It's also never able to quickly pull mail down for MFA codes, I have to use the provider's website to get those | I love how you can view the calendar as the entire month and still read your events. Email is easy to use and synced up with my other accounts easily! | This mobile email app enables you to send and receive emails reliably along with attachments. I’ve used this for years and had no problems. clear displays and functional icons make this app. Easy to use as well. I would recommend it. | I have heard of Outlook before but I never had to use it until I started working at my current job and when I say it has been easy to sort out emails and respond quickly this is what it is. | Excellent | Very happy with the system , thank you very much 👍✌️☘️ | Outlook is not user friendly | Good site | It is the best nothing to compare.I just love using it.

LET ME SEND MY VIDEO,PLEASE STOP BEING RACIST TO ME!!!! UNFORTUNATELY IF THIS KEEPS CONTINUING I WILL BE TELLING THE GOVERMNET AVOUT THIS AND YOU WONT BE VERY HAPPY | Discord is a good way to communicate and meet new people. However, I ignorantly said I was 9 as a joke and they refuse to give me my account back. I have sent them everything they wanted multiple times but still no results. | Every time I try to send someone a direct message it keeps telling me to do a “are you a human” test.In the end it just keeps telling me to do it but never giving me the test | Nice app | for the time i’ve used this app, i’ve had little to no problems aside from the change in layout which i wasn’t a huge fan of.. (sorry)! however today this morning, i was informed by a friend that their account had gotten hacked and mine as well as many other accounts were mass reported falsely for crimes me and many others DID NOT COMMIT. i had been on the phone with a staff member but was quickly cut short due to not giving them a specific amount of money just to prove my innocence. it truly disgusts me that ive not only lost my account as well as lose the ability to speak to my only friends. pls do better discord, and justice to my folks that got their accounts banned as well for no reason. | So I had to delete discord and was reinstalling it just now since I usually use it, but when I go in there, it just shows a screen in light mode, like the regular menu in white mode basically, and whenever I reinstall it it usually logs into my account immediately, but this time it just shows the bar that says it’s connecting but never actually connects. I’m not sure what happened, since it works perfectly fine on my iPhone, and I have good internet connection. So yeah I don’t know what to do right now | I | It makes me verify my account | I just loaded into discord and for some reason the profile pictures aren’t appearing and it’s annoying and I’m not sure what to do | Every time I make a account it makes me verify my email and I would be mad please fix it. | This app is pretty good but I do not recommend kids under age to use this app which is very dangerous for them as some old guys could talk to you and grom!ng them all tho its okay | I am trying to trade people to get a Kitsune fruit and this dumb app asks me 5times “verify your not a robot” if I was a robot how would I play bloxfruit plus it is not my frailty I type so fast on an iPad | Hun I use an IPhone for discord and whenever I play games there is no voice overlay why is that the case | Since the UI update a few months ago my Discord app has been freezing and crashing regularly. Mainly when I search for emojis to use.

I used to have an iPhone 12 mini, it was getting kinda old and two other app I use also had some issues. So, I upgraded to an iPhone 15 pro. Now it went from Discord crashing/freezing nearly every time I use the app to only about 3 times a day.

This is truly annoying and I’m debating switching to the web version on my phone since this the app is so horrible now. Please fix this Discord! | I keep getting logged out of my account, and actually I can’t get back in anymore bc the password won’t work even though it’s the correct one. That’s really the only thing that’s kind of irritating but yea if u can help please do | Why fix something that wasn’t broken. Yes my app is up to date. I wish it wasn’t though because the UI is terrible now. Change it back or at least give us an option to change it back. Switching through servers and messages is terrible now. Discord use to be good. Fire the new devs making these terrible updates. | Amazing how you make the app uglier and harder to navigate with every update | Good | Its good for everything but calls on console, its choppy I cut out a lot and phone isnt any better, and I know its discord because I’ve tried other apps honestly just writing hoping they fix it >~< | I bought nitro and it said “It seems there’s been an error, try again.” Like wdym try again you have my money? So i tried again and unsubscribed then bought it again, and it didn’t give me my nitro again!!! Please fix this. | I’m trying to login but it keeps on saying this email has already been used when it has not. I just downloaded this app and on my phone it does not work. I use my phone number and I typed in the code and I hit verify but it doesn’t verify I’ve tried everything. I’ve even tried to log into my old account and it didn’t work so that might just be for me, but you could try if you want to | can yall fix the stupid issue on the ipad where it shows the emoji weirdly spaced out and doesnt show all the emojis in the emojis tab and then also doesn’t show up when im typing them out (like with colons) so i have to perfectly remember the emoji name to get it in my message | Idk if it is a bug or something but I love this app so much but now when im on a private call with my couple he can’t hear me but a can hear him, and this it’s happening for at least for more than a week. Please, hope you can fix this because I love to share with my friends on this app so much! | can u guys fr mute the ppl we block or hide their messages out of our view idc about “1 blocked message” i dont care to see them talk at all. it just makes everything looked cluttered and ugly | Just add back old layout more than half the people that use the app complain about new layout old layout was so comfortable to use everybody has said they want old desktop layout for mobile back | Great overall, one issue: when I join a call, one particular person is muted, it says it is by me. so I go to unmute them and it is greyed out. I have seen Reddit pages where people say that happened but no solution PLEASE FIX THIS! it has happened twice now | Look I got into discord FINALLY and I went into some servers but after like a hour it just says to verify myself. Like why do I have to verify myself. I put in my email and password and it said I’ll get mail. BUT I DIDNT GET ANY MAIL. I kept in resending BUT I DIDNT GET ANT MAIL. Just because of that it gets 4 stars. It’s still a good app it’s just so annoying that it keeps popping up in my screen. The community is nice and all and I was having a good time but then the verification screen popped up and I couldn’t do anything about it. | This is is pretty okay, even though is has had some downsides, like now. There is one problem in particular that I have, which is streaming. My Xbox sometimes will not load or start streaming to discord vc, and I have tried multiple ways to fix the issue, such as: Restarting both app and console, disconnecting and reconnecting the xbox connection to discord, checking the “online & privacy” setting, etc. None have worked so far, please look into this. Also, I would like to have an option for PS4 to have the streaming service too, unfair for only the PS5 to have vc option. | I‘ve have this app since 2021, it is absolutely amazing whether you have Nitro or not! Amazing for texting and having fun friend group calls. | BLUD IT NEEDS TO STEP UP ITS GAME | After the recent update my mobile notifications won’t work no matter what I do, I’ve reset them and prioritized the channels I need notifications from and it still won’t work | New mobile layout ruins the app with no way to revert | Just leave the UI alone. It was never one of your problems, until you decided to change it. Stop it. Leave things where they go. I can’t find anything anymore and gestures do random things whenever attempted. For the love of god. Stop.

“Go read about the new stuff!” No. I won’t. I’ve used discord since beta, I shouldn’t HAVE TO. | Should have an option to disable it and go back to the old UI | I’ve enjoyed the app for a while, it’s good for communication between large groups- however, with every coming update I keep hoping and keep getting disappointed. The mobile app is so extremely buggy these days that I’ve been tempted to delete it and instead use the browser version of discord on my phone which is obviously quite hard to work with on it’s own because it wasn’t made for phones. Well in the one that’s made for phones it’s hard to find the pins of threads at all. It’s extremely frustrating that one cannot search threads but instead has to search the channel. As well, any channels that share names might have their pins swapped so then you have to go into the channel settings and look at the pins through there. Finally, and the biggest cause for my frustration, is even when my phone’s rotation is locked, if I try to search a channel or look at it’s settings/members then the screen will rotate some random way. It doesn’t matter if I’m holding my phone straight, sideways, upside down, it will rotate, it is especially annoying when trying to find something quickly. | Go back to old layout please | Ive been a discord user since 2020 theres been tons of changes but this one this recent one is horrible and confusing. I used discord because i understand it and it isnt confusing. Congrats discord. I hate your app | Please update app there are bugs. Thank you. | WHY DID IT CHANGE IN THE FIRST PLACE!? | Every time I except a invite I keep getting send to the App Store despite me already having the discord because of this I haven’t been able to join a discord server for about two years now | So I got falsely reported by someone I knew 3 yrs ago for being a scammer, and they mass reported me. But they came to their senses and realized that I was NOT the one who did it, so they contacted discord and told them to not delete my acc. But discord went ahead and made me prove myself.
How ya might ask??? By buying at least $800 in gift cards. Not for myself, but for them. They promised me it was refundable. But the next day ( today), they claimed that the refund was error, and I had to pay another $500 fee to get the money back. Now they won’t even respond to me anymore. ATP im thinking I got scammed by discord themselves, and they’re not gonna refund my money, but gonna make me completely drain my bank account for them. 
And to add, I only have $500 so after I pay another $500, I got an even $0, no money to pay for gas to even go to work. I’m broke now, and can’t even get to work because of these ppl. 🤦🤦🤦🤦 | There been some lags with emojis from different apps,
My favorite emoji app was from fan made video game.
But every time I use it discord kicks me out please fix it. | Yea discord is AMAZING but I am going to keep this short just use IMessages | This new user interface for the emoji keyboard is not showing every single server emoji, even when i go to the server tab. I can’t access some of the emojis I pay MONEY to use. Please fix this as soon as possible, all emojis should show, not just 33 out of the 50 I have made. | I’m not sure what’s happened but discord does not seem optimized to run on ipad ios. Works fine on iphone, android and PC though… | I don’t give a $h!t about some stupid poll option, move the camera option back out of the photos so I can send them easier. | It’s an amazing app however my screen sharing doesn’t work anymore and I can’t seem to fix it at all | I’ve used discord for a few years and it always worked fine for me. I really enjoy it. Ever since the new UI update changed things around, my app on my phone has been incredibly buggy. It’s slower when switching between servers and messages. Whenever I’m in a call with someone, sometimes I can’t send messages. The entire keyboard disappears. Whenever an alarm goes off or I mute myself and then unmute myself, my discord audio just stops working. I am having to constantly close the app and restart it to get it to work now. I am not the only one having these issues, I’ve spoken to other people that also have these issues. Both on android and iphone. I’ve been waiting on them to fix these issues but it hasn’t happened yet so I figured I would write a review to let you know these things are happening. I love this app, please bring it back to being useable.

Edit: I keep my app regularly updated.

mine.",4.74432,20647,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c7/bb/ac/c7bbac27-6b5a-203d-f39a-a631d0e9cba4/2cf8b2dc-c55e-45f6-a62d-67d1ab79d757_HT_5.5_1a.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/15/4c/7a/154c7a9e-0bd3-6105-b24d-48f32d0f0126/5ea3a7bd-b5c2-4e7f-95b9-0eb92120cd6b_HT_5.5_2a.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/94/36/2b/94362b69-1be0-9317-6259-fe21cc3f608b/dd27fd79-c18a-4688-b837-f3f7359627b9_HT_5.5_3a.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b5/86/5e/b5865e01-6112-a8f0-bbf6-3e19c6de0045/31b87d92-dc36-4a54-930b-b27f03e0e4ab_HT_5.5_4a.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/82/3a/40/823a40ee-1f02-70b2-d2b6-5ee538519518/b87fcb45-2536-45cd-843d-3619d650c652_HT_5.5_5a.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/99/f7/c7/99f7c778-9333-8c6c-c5f1-5031826f8244/a732bc4b-4045-4da9-8c19-ee9e1da6f4e5_1-Your-place-to-hang-out-with-friends-and-communities.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/9c/a5/18/9ca5181d-3782-fd33-9dc4-305ee4f1d7e6/e622bb15-b831-48e1-a7e2-1556bc6fdfdb_2-Stay-connected-with-video-voice-and-text.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/33/0a/0e/330a0e17-d6d4-74e9-24a2-c431cf182d4d/36d624b9-6398-4537-8bfd-fca68051bf4e_3-Create-custom-channels-for-the-topics-you-love.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a2/30/5b/a2305be1-737a-da26-04b6-aefa5eaf01c4/199c0ca0-d93c-4dde-9cbb-e31bbaad9fb1_4-See-whos-hanging-out-and-join-without-having-to-call.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/cc/74/7c/cc747c45-2e33-1def-9560-020cbdc34169/deff626f-5d07-47a4-84a2-11641ebb8085_5-Organize-any-community-with-roles-and-permissions.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/0f/66/f4/0f66f47e-af15-06fa-f7e4-aa5c4673588a/11717296-5aeb-4dbd-912f-5381b5cf0f48_6-Keep-the-conversation-going-on-mobile-and-PC.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-i

Seems like I’m just throwing away money for no reason | This truly works with sooooooooooooo much and as middle schooler doing high school work it helps a lot | This saved my life | did math i actually thought was impossible😭 | I downloaded this app as a way to HELP me with my homework (i’m not good at math) all i’d did was give me semi- correct or wrong answers. DO NOT DOWNLOAD | I have seen how Photomath helps me a lot, it even solves word problems I’m so impressed best math app I’ve ever seen! | I’ve tried multiple times to Photomath a question where I get a completely different equation like how? Fix it. | SO BAD ALL IT SAYS IS CANT FIND PROBLEM NEED TO FIX THIS NOW | Can’t solve anything always gives wrong question there is way better apps for this | Terrible | I tried using gauth math but it really wasnt worth the deal.. but then I switched to photomath and it help phenomenally. I really love this app and i will continue to use it!! | The reason why this is the best is because when I have homework due Tomorrow I can take 10 mins off my time to use this app | I love this app and is my no.1 app for studying math but sometimes it may not know how to solve a problem but the answers are accurate and gives helpful solutions on how to solve it. | I love useing this it helps me understand problems | Wonder what the next update will be genuinely curious | It is a ok app but it can not solve 6th grade math the math is divide the whole numbers by standard algorithm | Great app | This is way too hard to use. Just stick with Siri. This makes no sense. My daughter tried using this and it’s horrible. | basically I’m in 5th grade struggling with math and all it does is walk me through 3 steps then leaves me there confused, I’m not gonna pay for plus it’s a waste of money | The only problem I have is that sometimes it doesn’t even do the right problem. | The app is nice but it doesn’t work for some questions. I take a picture and it loads to show me a answer from the same graph, chart, table, etc. but it dosnt have the same question that is being asked, and no matter how many times I try I still get the same answer, there is no other answers to that problem that ask different questions. Another thing, I take a picture of the question and it brings up a totally different problem that dosnt even look anything like the problem I took a picture of. Other times I take a picture of a problem and it doesn’t give me anything, no matter how many times I take a photo the problem with different angles and everything shown. But when the app works, it works well. I just wish they had a verity of problems with a number of different questions being asked that would help me. | The regular explanation it should be more complete without paying. | Easy to understand and see what’s going on as the problem solves. But then you have to pay extra to understand deeply | I have photomath plus and this app having the ability to explain problems to you is amazing! It can solve anything from elementary arithmetic to college level mathematics. Would recommend! | Nobody has any ideas the lengths I went through to understand algebra. This app has saved my life. This app has saved my career. This app saved me from failure. Thank you to whoever created this. You’re amazing and I appreciate you and I love you . | You literally can’t use the app without signing up for the “plus” you have to pay for evrything. It won’t solve the equation unless you pay for it. | If you truly do not know the subject it actually helps | It’s a great app if you need help buuuuuuut you have to pay for like half of my geometry stuff and if you have the subscription on another device it doesn’t let you log in sooo it’s not bad but it could use some work | thank you Photomath I actually love you guys so much you saved my butt. 🩷🩷 | Why can’t photo math solve basic 5th grade math.. | It has been a huge help! Explanations are broken down in order to easily understand! 
Best investment for a homeschool mom that hasn’t used this type of math well never.🙂 | I really like it. I just wish they could also do letter math like algebra and geometry. I guess maybe it’s because of my grade level or something but yeah that’s the only problem I have a Photomath I really like it and I feel like you should download the app if you have any problems that does not have to do with maths. | I was testing out the app but when I used it mid school I accidentally put 5 years old I am in 5th and this helped me with the test and I got a A+ 100% | Tried to use it to solve a problem the. When I put in the answer IT  gave me it said it was wrong 
So I stand at my title this is MONKEY NUTS | Some problems it can’t solve but is can solve most and the expansion are really good. | Helps a lot with algebra homework and I’m sure  easier math | You should make photoscience | At first I didn’t like it bc it didn’t properly match up my answer. But I realized my camera was side ways! Once I turned my camera it gave me correct answers. | Very helpful helped me not get homework | It helps with some math but either it’s showing a whole different question or it gives you the wrong answer | It really does help a lot on showing you how to do the problems!! | This app is so good it’s helping me pass my math class and gives me extra credit | gyat rizz I love thizz | I love this app so much, it literally saves me so much time searching for help and it just explains it to me. Use it all the time!! | This app helped A+ math with walking through the steps with a math problem | It was awesome helped me finished my homework in less than 5 minutes i totally recommend it also you guys should sponsor my channel the name is Storm Hawk Official and in your commercials you should mention my channel please thanks photo math | this app is so helpful to do math homework | Pretty much no flaws, love it so much, and it seriously is helping bring my grade up!!!

This means that in addition to your password, you'll also need to enter a code that is generated by the Google Authenticator app on your phone.

The verification code can be generated by the Google Authenticator app on your phone, even if you don't have a network or mobile connection.

• Sync your Authenticator codes to your Google Account and across your devices. This way, you can always access them even if you lose your phone.

• Set up your Authenticator accounts automatically with a QR code. This is quick and easy, and it helps to ensure that your codes are set up correctly.

• Support for multiple accounts. You can use the authenticator app to manage multiple accounts, so you don't have to switch between apps every time you need to sign in.

• Support for time-based and counter-based code generation. You can choose the type of code generation that best suits your needs.

• Transfer accounts between devices with a QR code. This is a convenient way to move your accounts to a new device.

Really not cool. This will move people to other authentication apps. | Really easy to use | You have to start all over again with your crypto accounts when your phone breaks. | I just recently got this for my roblox account and it’s actually pretty good! So if you war downloading the app for your roblox account just reminder, Go take a picture of your backup code if something happend! Thank you for reading! <3 | I’m no longer able to login to some of my accounts because I forgot to import the codes from the old phone to the new phone and the DUO app doesn’t require importing. Which is why I say that this Google Authenticator is a very crappy app | perfect app for authentication | If you use 2fa with your phone then use this. It just works. | Love it | I use this all the time. It’s easy to use. | Love Google so much | Stops scams and outsiders from being able to get inside your account | I love the app but stop asking me to rate this app | The process of setting up an Authenticator app must have been created by a monkey. Tried to set it up…oh wait I’m in the wrong account. Let me just simply change accounts after all it’s easy in a desktop. No no no not that simple.  It was so convoluted that I had to google it. Open browser, select settings. Rather than there being a sign out button like a rational person would assume I have to click on my account name. Still no sign out button. Oh but we’re not done yet. Not by a long shot. 

Scroll allllll the way down. Click manage accounts on this device and then sign out. Next comes the best part. 

I click sign in and google gloriously gives one option to select…the account I just signed out of. I then have to click on the account that I just signed out of to enter a hidden super duper secret screen where I can finally see my other accounts. 

Whoever invented this UI should have their head examined. | First time using and no idea what the app is doing which is taking forever without any explanation | I faced problems with hacking roughly a year ago. And have been still dealing with having to recover stuff till this day. And actually use wild and obnoxious passwords. | Export and import not working properly between 2 google accounts | Been digging for a while on tutorials, but Google made it difficult and not seem less at all to leave this app and use other open sourced apps available on Apple Store | Just remember when taking the picture of the bar code begin in the google authenticator app.  Works good. Recommend | It’s just that good! Ty ty to all the engineers and other peeps involved in making this🍵🍵🍵 | Works great. 
I’d like the import/export to use some kind of standard format that Authy or Yubikey Authenticator could use too. | It does not make sense | The only way I could do that was if you wanted me too I could come and pick it out and then I can go pick up it from your place or you could just pick me out of there or you could pick me out and I could just go pick up | Really! Really! Nice I love it ❤️❤️ | I didn’t install but is on my iPad it constantly shakes with the little minus sign but it will not remove.. | NEEDED, LOVE THIS SECURITY ! | i've uninstalled, reinstalled, closed and opened the app, looked for a ""sync"" button but there IS NO sync button, codes DO NOT work no matter how MANY TIMES i've put in a new one! 😡😡😡 i am frustrated!! zero stars if i could. | Its a scam do not use! I tried it and none of the codes work at all! If you try again all it does is make a code and saves it making you unsure which code is which. Theres nothing you can do about it! | Google Authenticator makes 2-step verification easy | Thanks, | I got a new phone and now I can’t get in to any of my accounts that require this Authenticator. Why on earth would you make this so frustrating. If it’s still my same log in then why is it as if it’s a new account. Spending hours trying to fix this | This app worked as intended until one day it deleted all of my codes without warning and then acted like I had never set any up. Switching to Okta. | I had to download this for work. So who cares if I like it or not?  Stop with these lame marketing initiatives when I just need to click on something for work. | Please | Great app , I usually use it for my business. Everything is work good . Recommend 100%! | All my codes are gone. Two days ago they were all there. Customer support is nonexistent. Google is going downhill | Doesn’t work and I can’t get into my account | The Google Authenticator app is great. | Let’s of steps. Lots of technical jargon. This is an app designed to make the average user frustrated. HORRIBLE!!!!!! | This is a pain and not that easy. | I still wait for my passwords coming to this app. | Easy to use | Theres mo backup option, can’t log into one of my accounts because they don’t do backups unless you enable it beforehand | I would give 5 stars if it was amazing. The app is average in the sense that it performs as needed. For example if you uber driver picks you up and drops you at the requested location i don't give 5 stars. Five stars is for an amazing job no the standard. FYI standard is good, not bad. Is just not amazing | For Roblox, the codes don't come to my Authenticator app and I’ve been trying for hours, thank you for listening | Sure after you find out the app has a camera. | Be aware !!! When you transfer phone this authenticator will not transfer and no warning at all!!! | It is what it is. | very good | Wish you could add icons/pics to items, helps when you have a lot of 2FA… | The title says it all…
They are so interested in tying all your personal info to everything you do, that they will not allow you to use this app unless they have some other piece of personal info tied to your account first!
When you try to set up two-factor on a new Gmail account, the option to use authenticator codes as a method never shows up unless they have either a phone number, another email, (which also probably has a phone number attached), or unless you tie your account to some device you own so Google can track it (they call that a prompt…)
