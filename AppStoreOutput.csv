SEE IT ON A MAP

Every time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.

STORE PLANS OFFLINE

All your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.

GET ON THE ROAD

Looking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.

COLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS

For group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.

STAY ORGANIZED

Access flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.

GET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION

For each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.

CONTROL YOUR SPENDING

Set a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/04/99/7d/04997d95-7783-c032-fbaf-0eeb52bbbd68/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","106180608","13.0","2019-08-22T07:00:00Z","2024-04-11T22:31:17Z","Wanderlog's available in more languages!

I love the map feature and it makes planning travel and the actual travel so much easier and a smoother ride. Definitely recommend for type A travelers! | It may be a useful app but it’s quite annoying. Every thing I click on has constant tool tips even though I have that turned off in settings. It keeps asking me if I want Pro and has an x to hide it but it always comes back the next time. Just overloads you with options and questions as well.

Edit: Co-founder responded. Apparently, even though you have tool tips disabled, they still show some. Also never addressed the constant nagging to buy Pro even though you click the x to stop showing it (comes back). And $50 is ridiculous. $10, yes. A useful app but the endless amount of tips and bags will lead me elsewhere if it continues. | I liked that you are able to see the places you want to visit in a map, that way you can organize your itinerary by area. That helped me creating my route to my trip to Japan. I will definitely use it for my next trip. | This app is so amazing. I highly recommend it. After using it to plan a 4 month trip I love it. It does all it says it does. A thing or 2 I could only do on the app or on the computer but I could do all it says it does. On one thing I had a question and got a quick & detailed response from the developer (email is in the help section of app). | I was hoping this would work for road trips. Things do do from Point A to Point B | Just got back from a 9 day on-the-go Spain trip.  Wanderlog made planning the trip easier (being able to visualize everything on the map and drag-and-drop places to different days/times was great!).  We put in all of our flights/trains/rental-cars, restaurants, sites...  And my wife and I were able to collaborate. I'd get excited seeing her putitng in a Flamenco concert she booked for one evening for example. And then on the trip, it was so nice to have one place to reference for everything about our plans. 

I can honestl say Wanderlog made our trip better than it would have been. | I literally unsubscribed from the free trial offer five minutes after adding it and was still charged. And with you’re “refund policy” being only if an enforcement company requires you to, you actually don’t care about your users. Just greedy. I would like my money back | Great app for organizing your trip!  From collecting reservation information to identifying attractions to creating itineraries. It does it all. Highly recommended! | I’ve been using Wanderlog for close to a year now and very much love the app + website. For each destination, I start with a master list of places of interest. Using existing lists are extremely helpful to make the master list. Then I build an itinerary from it. Adding approximate time spent at the place and the app providing time between the places helps a lot when planning. What I’ve been most impressed with is the robustness of the app. I haven’t had any issue with incorrect information, data loss, app crashing or unavailability. The UI / UX is very intuitive. They have quite a few other features that I can being useful. | This app has made planning vacations so much easier to organize! I love how simple it is to build my itinerary and see how things are situated on the map. It’s also great for tracking how much money I’m spending! A must have for travelers! | Well, I was told I would get notification after my free trial period before they took my money. But that did not happen and they refuse a refund. So try at your own risk, but you might get your money stolen. | I don’t ever really write reviews, but I love to travel. I had mostly been writing out my itineraries on paper, but than I decided it might be easier to do with an app. So I downloaded a bunch, like 10, and just tried them out. Wanderlog was truly, by far, above the rest. The budget feature in particular was fantastic, I went to Europe with a bunch of friends and it was really helpful for tracking expenses, and the fact that it automatically converts currency within calculations is really helpful and a nice touch. I now use wanderlog every time I travel and I really love it. | This app has it all. I love all of the organization. The mapping is the best part! I also love knowing how long it will take to get from place to place. The only drawback is, in some there google driven guides the places are closed for good. | Love the sharing option. Makes itinarary so much easier. | This has been amazing app from throwing ideas together to really finalizing the smallest details.  However, what is more important is the support team, I spent months putting a trip together and accidentally deleted it, within hours they were able to restore my trip and save me hours of recreation, and many more tears. | One of the best apps i used in japan, it really organized my trip. | first of all, it is deceiving when it says sign up for the pro version for roughly around three dollars a month when in reality you sign up for the annual price it does not give you a month-to-month option. 

Second of all the pro features don’t even work the whole point was for it to pull your itinerary information and add your flight info automatically. instead it pulled old itineraries from the last year or two that are already irrelevant. I don’t understand why it would search that far back and my most recent emails with the upcoming flight info couldn’t even be added into the app. I had to manually add my flight info. 

third of all as soon as you create your account, your bombarded with 20+ pop-ups I selected no more tips and it’s still kept coming up with all of these pop-ups. It was so annoying. | Would recommend it to anyone 
Help me and my girlfriend sort out everything we needed easily during our travels | I acquired this app based on its outstanding reviews; however, it has proven to be a profound disappointment. Not only is it functionally inadequate, but it also requires a subscription. Rather than providing useful suggestions, it merely retrieves articles about activities in various cities, a task I could easily perform myself. My primary desire was for quick itinerary suggestions, a feature this app fails to deliver. Additionally, its incessant interruptions to offer tips on its interface only compound the frustration. One must question the design decisions that led to such a cumbersome user experience. | Such a nice app to lean on when you have a trip planned and have a lot of cooks in the kitchen of planning 😄 | Really great app | I have waited all my life for a way to plan trips this efficiently. Thank you for making such an incredible app! I tell everyone about it. | This app helped me keep a month long multi-city trip through Europe organized.  I love that it has the ability to forward emails to your itinerary and it will upload the confirmation directly for hotels, transit and other reservations.  I was able to share it with my co-travelers and they can add points of interest and help with to-do list and wish lists.  If this can keep me organized so easily, then it’s definitely worth it! | If you’re a freak about organizing your trips, everything about this app is spot on! | I tried this for LA and it had locations WAY far off like Palm Springs Liberace house. It also had a charity museum that had no activity on instagram since 2020….unless I’m missing something.  Also the charity location is an hour away from the location I input.  It had a “permanently closed” restaurant listed.  Wasted my time.I don’t get it . | this app would be amazing if fully worked!! won’t let me add certain places to my lists. no reason. just does nothing when you click add. don’t have this problem using the web version ?? | I use my home town in Delaware and asked for it to suggest some places to go out to eat. Well it picked three places I never heard of, the name of the town was right but they were in Canada a few hundred miles away. 
Ok so I understand this is a trip planner but I’d love to have a better control over where the heck this AI thinks I should go. Nope, not going to buy this one! | So helpful!! This made our trip so much better. It makes planning easier and more fun, and traveling so much less stressful. Love the map feature where you can see the layout of your itinerary. I kept everything in my notes app before and it was a pain. You need this! Love the free features too. | I love this app! I can make checklists (packing lists and lists to help me remember what I need for each daily adventure). The way you can forward a hotel or flight or rental car reservation and it automatically adds it all to your itenerary including confirmation numbers, addresses and cost for your budget is phenomenal. I love how it offers suggestions on sights to see and things to do and places to eat. Plus all of my friends or family whom I invite to share it with can also have all the information right at hand. I’d give this app 100 stars if possible. I’ve used it for 5 trips now and will never use anything else. | A great app for traveling together with friends. Easy to upload accommodations, schedules, and finances. If you are traveling with friends this app is perfect. I highly recommend it!!! | Ever since I discovered Wanderlog, I’ve used it to plan every trip I’ve been on and have told anyone who will listen about it. The app’s itinerary building functions, the option to create different lists, and the ability to share with others makes it indispensable. It’s near perfect and I recommend the following to the developers: allows old trips to be archived automatically based on dates, allow blocking for nonspecific activities in the itinerary, incorporate the visited map from the web into the app, and add a feature to organize places you’d like to visit by continent, country, etc. | Overall this is an amazing all. I’ve always used google sheets to plan my trip because the alternatives weren’t great. For the first time, I started using an app that solves my need right from planing to on the road. 

Having said that, the app is slow when you add many locations. Additionally, the drive times are incorrect on the app. So I have to switch to computer. The route optimization cannot be done across multiple days. If some of these can be fixed, I’ll be happy to pay for the app. | I’m type A personality and I knew for my trip I needed somewhere I could write down an itinerary. Wanderlog was that and more! I loved being able to plug in all the things and have everything in one place. Thank you thank you thank you! | I had great hopes in using this app. However, it is not sophisticated enough to insert manual planning. I have a trip already planned that I tried to set up in this app and it just doesn’t work. I already have plane tickets, hotels, cruise, etc. It just won’t let me EASILY add everything. Not worth the effort in trying to figure it out. Stick with the spreadsheet!! | I downloaded this app to plan a roadtrip to the Philippines. I love how simple and customizable it is. I also love that you can share it to people and they don’t have to download the app to view or edit it. Most locations I need are searchable. It’s mostly free until I want to save it offline which is great because I can plan free before my trip and only pay for it when I need it.

Some suggestions that would make this app even better: 
- Having the option to make certain pages private
- Being able to mention your tripmates and make action items so it’s clear on who is responsible for what
- Being able to pool money as a trip mate and assigning who is responsible for paying. I feel like a lot of group trips, there is a designated person for food, lodging, gas, etc.
- Being able to customize the color of Notes. I have a few and it blends in really well with the Places because they are the same color.
- Being able to assign sub-budgets, perhaps by Place you’re going to or by type of expense (food, lodging, gas etc) | We used Wanderlog for the first time on a 10 day trip and it was amazing!  Easy to set up, great recommendations!  Will be using for all trips from now on. | Please make this app compatible with Airbnb!!! It’s a pretty good app, but there seem to be a lot of minor glitches. I really like that it gives me a time frame to get from one point to the other and it creates the most seamless transition, but it is super slow and I can’t add accommodations for Airbnb. Also, once I’ve gotten rid of a box, I don’t want it to keep popping up…it’s incredibly frustrating. | Wowed by the amount of information I can find in this app. Wanderlog has asked and answered all of the questions you have about traveling, organized them and put them all in one app. SO useful!  I'm just at the tip of the iceberg and can't wait to explore more! | This app really was essential in the planning of my trip. It allowed me to make a list of all the things we wanted to do and see and then work to fill in the gaps!  I referred to it when e had some down time or looking for a place to eat nearby. | Literally the best app for planning trips. So easy to use and able to collaborate with friends! | Loved this app. It really helped me plan for a better trip as to maximize areas and sites I wanted to see. I will definitely use it from now on when planning. | Very User Friendly!  My son recommended this app and honestly I was hesitant. I normally turn to paper and pen. But boy what a revelation this app turned out to be; so convenient to have everything in one place. Loading travel plans was a breeze!  Adding places to visit was easy. Also the app provides ideas for stops. Love it. | I had plans to use this and after 1 week got a hard stop. | This app has every feature I would put into a travel planning app! I am thrilled with it! | I am really enjoying the app. It would be helpful if there was a driving map, so we don’t have to use other apps for planning. | I used this app to plan my trip to Japan and absolutely LOVED how easy it was to plan out all the restaurants, landmarks, train stations, and hotels on the map and organize everything into their own respective categories! I found it so helpful that they also auto color code the points on the map based on the category I put them in (I put them in categories of cafes, restaurants, transportation stops, etc.). I had the best trip all because I was able to add all my notes into this app, and now I send my itinerary to everyone I can and always tell my friends and family to plan everything using this app! | Wonderful app! I love to able to save all the places of interest and it auto populates in the map & numbered too. Great for organizing my days on a trip and even adding what restaurants I want to visit etc. Super helpful app and very easy to use! Love it and highly recommend it. | This app totally changed how I plan and travel!!! I am recommending it to everyone I know. We went to Berlin as a family of 5. Everyone had access to the itinerary for planning purposes. And I, as the planner, was able to put all of our trip details (and all my research) in one place, making a huge improvement in how we sightsee. This is a very robust and useful travel tool! | I have always used Roadtrippers until they started ripping people off with their prices.   I made the switch and really like using wonderlog now.   It is different from when I was used to using, but I think I like it a lot better.  I love the easy way you can keep all of your documents together in one place. | I really hate planning trips…not because I don’t enjoy picking out cool places to go, but because I struggle with things like timing and organization. This app really helped me to put together an itinerary that included all of the places I wanted to go, plus gave me a few suggestions to fill in some gaps.

It does its magic in the background and the notifications are great. Highly recommend it. | I’ve travelled 830,000 miles and using the app since 2008. I love it. Feedback: would love to see more detailed insights on past travels. In this sense I enjoy Flighty. Hope to see this in TripIt! | Everything organized in ONE place.  Remind me for delay flight & check-in time etc... | We used this app and everyone knew what was on the schedule for the day 
Easy to use and email notifications were great | I stumbled upon this app about 5 years ago before it became huge and my opinion has never changed. It’s such a great app, it’s simplistic and stays up to date as you are on the move (literally!) it is totally worth paying for in my opinion even if you don’t necessarily fly to travel,, you can still make smaller itineraries. It is one of the best apps out there! | I luv this app, it keeps my entire itinerary when I travel in one place and I get alerts through the TripIt app before the airlines send updates. It’s amazing. I highly recommend. | Have used this app for a couple of years now after trying several. I like the rate change notifications as well as changes gate changes and other reminders. Dust wish it was easier to upload travel itineraries created on ChatGPT/or other AI to track the entire vacation. | I do not find a way to contact personnel at TripIt.  Poor customer service options-currently | Not sure how this app has not been acquired by the likes of Apple or some big outfit. It is beyond AMAZING. 

Works like magic and makes checking emails for trip information a thing of the past. Don’t travel as much as I used to but when I do, TripIt is a must use app for all aspects of the trip. Lifesaver!! | Could not upload anything but airline schedule. I will go back to manually generating my schedule and itinerary.  I’m not sure if it was user error but I have given up. Great concept. | This app looks nice, but the ridiculous amount of time that I’m spending to just
• get my trip info imported from my email 
• take my phone number to push SMS messages
• to not have to enter all this info manually
•to not have to forward the info to an email to send to this app
• to figure out how to effectively refresh this app and maybe it will retrieve my flight, hotel, trip reservations..
• see that I just purchased to pro and it still has not populated my upcoming trip..

Is giving free app vibes, when I know I’ve spent money… | I have used this app for over 10 years and consider it one of my go-to apps for travel. It’s simple and easy to use. | Enjoying organizing our trips.   Amazing app.   Worth the effort to have everything organized.   Especially like having it flow to my Apple calendar | Can’t sync email. Can’t edit things within itinerary without it freezing or just not loading or giving errors…seems like it could be a great app tho | I don’t travel much but when I do I use TripIt extensively. It is extremely useful and helps keeps me on track. | Not happy with 25 pdf limitation  AT ALL.  I have a 3 week trip coming up and certain arrangements and tour details will need to be maintained outside of App. Questioning whether Trip It Pro is worth it. I love the app, but this is the main reason I upgraded and spent the money. | TripIt is awesome! I travel frequently and TripIt lets me have all the info I need right in one place without having to lift a finger. | For my trip I booked flights with several different airlines. When I edit the confirmation number for one flight, it saves that confirmation number as the new updated confirmation number for all of my flights on the trip, even though all of the confirmation numbers should be different. | Comprehensive & intuitive app! Pulls all travel plans from email. I receive notices before the airlines notices come through. | I googled for a trip organizer or some sort of reminder for events. And this app popped up. And it was the best decision ever. It made everything so much better, timing, reminders organizer itinerary. I got to do a-lot more of activities and events on my trip thanks to the app and is easy way of keeping everything including address and tickets store and at hand. | Love that it tracks my trips, airline ticket numbers, hotel confirmations, etc. but what I REALLY love is that I can look at it and immediately see when I will be out of town. Yes, that info is already in my calendar, but TripIt segregates my travel schedules in a much more accessible way. Perfect for capturing all of the other vacation/travel related items and categorizing them appropriately. When someone asks if I’m available in September, I look at TripIt first.  That provides the overview. Also, I can share all of our plans with my husband and traveling companions. And I can share my travel info with family that are not traveling, if anyone needs to contact me. Great app. | I just received an alert from TripIt saying that the price had dropped on my flight by $160. Just called the airline and got my $160 credit.

I also like that, all of my reservations are in one place car, hotel, flights. It even gives you warnings when things don’t look right. | This app not only helped me organize my trip and order the activities, but it is SO simply to get everything added! And you can share it with everyone on the trip so everyone has all the information and access to tickets, etc. I would give this app 10 stars if I could! Well done! | This is so great to plan your itinerary. | Excellent app. | Just started testing out this app to see if I want to purchase the pro version. So far it has kinks that need to be fixed before I’ll pay for it. When adding multiple flights to a single trip, it won’t allow you to have multiple confirmation numbers, even when selecting different airlines. I book a lot of separate tickets so this is very frustrating.

Updated to add that if you forward the itineraries, the confirmation numbers are correct. It only glitches if you enter them manually. | This app works the best for coordinating your vacations itinerary. Just email your confirmation s and it sorts out date time and everything. It’s especially helpful in keeping you in sync with the location time zones. Highly recommended for anyone going on trips. | Love the ease of the app. We set up a special email for tripit that we use for all trip notices that integrates with tripit. We have done 370 trips and don't plan on switching apps. I love that Pro keeps your history. I love the text alerts they keep me on the right path and saves me so much time. Everything I need for a trip is here. | Trying to access app, unfortunately crashes started to happen with notice that app is temporarily unavailable. Very disappointing. Removed/Uninstalled app and started again to try and login, same error. | I love the idea everything is in one place but It’s taking forever to add documents and keeps freezing so I have to close and restart every time | Love how it imports trip info from my email. So easy to stay on top of flights and hotels | It is so helpful and so easy to use! | This is my favorite app of all time. If you travel you need this. Easy, even for old folks to use. 10 stars. | I’ve thought this was a solid app for tracking travel plans, but had a wonderful surprise today when I received a text that my Southwest flight in 2 months was $60 cheaper (same flight) and not only told me to call to get a flight credit, but gave me the number. To say I was happy is an understatement. | Love it | Love to organize my trips on this app. Added bonus with Tripit Pro- they notify you if price changes on your flight allowing you to request refund! Love it | There are certainly areas to grow.  But, from my experience this the best and easiest app to use.  I do wish when I send confirmations for events such as concerts, sporting events, tours or excursions it would do a better job in adding to the plan with the appropriate event type. 

My wife and I share the travel planning.  This really helps us keep track of what’s been purchased and what still needs to be addressed.

 In the future I could imagine this app or a competitor leveraging machine learning and/or AI to do something special.  Probably would get purchased by one of the big players in the space like Expedia or booking.com | Love the one stop shop for tracking all my business travel

One thing. I wish that when I check into to flights it would allow me to add the boarding pass to my apply wallet, but I have to go on the website to do that, rather than TripIt. I mainly fly southwest so it may just be with that airline. | I’m having trouble importing new trip details from my emails on file. Not sure why this stopped happening. | TripIt is my favorite travel app. I don’t know how they do what they do, but they always beat the airlines when it comes to providing flight delays, cancellations, and gate change notifications. if you travel a lot, TripIt Pro definitely is worth it. | I’ve planned two trips in a few weeks. I’ve used this app and it has made them so easy. I have coordinated a trip for three people with three different airline itineraries, nightly dinner at six different locations for the week, to and from transportation and events. Talk about an easy effort, everything set up automatically and I was able to email it to the folks involved! Thank you for creating an app that actually does what it says it’s going to do and works so effectively!! | Simple and easy to coordinate hotel/car/flight information. Simple to look back and find the info as well. | I have had this app for about a year and I love, love, love it. I usually have several trips in the planning stage. This app lets me keep track of everything in one place. I easily see exactly what I have booked from flights, hotels, tours, restaurant reservations, theater performances and just about anything else. It is easy to use and edit any change of plans. I have recommended this app to friends. I am so glad I have this app. | It has been a great help to me in organizing my trips. | Oh my God I just learned about this app today and played with it for 10 minutes and it’s so helpful to organize my itinerary and saved me a lot of manual work. I’m totally impressed. | I have almost 4 million seat miles on AA.  I use this for every trip business and personal.  Saves a ton of time and it organizes everything involved in travel.  It’s awesome. | This travel app is absolutely amazing!
Create a trip and send confirmation emails to input!  Helps you catch errors, make sure you have no gaps, etc. includes all transportations, reservations, lodging etc with all the info you need in it. | Was seriously loving this app to plan a big trip with the family. Lots of planes, trains, hotels to keep track of. Once I realized the max PDF files was 3 with the free version I immediately upgraded to Pro to then only find out that they once again maxed out at 25 uploads. Geez…. It was my main reason for paying! | This is the best app ever I shared it with two friends that are not Internet savvy, and they are very excited to use this for their upcoming European trip.  My friend and I are able to share our updates and I love the expansions on each location that provides more detail that we don’t have to look up. I do wish they could add some sort of budget where you could see the total of your budget at the top or something but other than that it’s amazing. It’s a great app they can be used with, anything you’re doing on your trip and I love the chronological order | I’ve been using KAYAK for a while to plan and share trip information, but it isn’t a perfect tool, so I thought I’d try TripIt for a while. 

It is easy to add your plans to TripIt, just forward it reservation emails; Kayak does this too. You can also enter or change details manually. Tripit is somewhat better than kayak for this. 

With TripIt, it is easy to share a trip with participants who can update the trip with you (e.g. one person works on transportation, another on lodging, etc). The whole trip collaboration thing is easier with TripIt than KAYAK. 

The subscribed calendar support in KAYAK is much better than TripIt. With KAYAK you can see all your trips, including flights and lodging, on your device calendar. I can easily see how my trips fit into all my other plans. Other people can see my trips on their calendars too. I just share a calendar link with friends and family so they can see where I am and how to reach me on their own device calendars without using the kayak app at all; they like that. 

Tripit also supports subscribed calendars, but doesn’t include the detailed plans.

Links and documents are seamless from emails,  webpages, maps, pictures, anything you want to add to your itinerary is done. It is extremely user friendly, easy to update, change, delete or add something. Reservations directly from your multiple emails (including my friends) upload instantly into my itinerary. I love being able to choose my own background pictures for my trips and see them all lined up on my phone. I do wish there was a print feature and maybe a rating system for entries in old trips so i can remember which restaurants/tours etc were worth it and which to skip although i can always just put notes so I’m nitpicking. Really well done and i love not having to worry about adding too many documents or links or trips. Excellent app for travelers! | I love how I can put in items without an and time.  Having issues syncing between devices.  Don't like if you just assign a location as ""afternoon"" it will show at the bottom of the day's itinerary vs in timeline order. Parking also doesn't show on itinerary, but does have it on the main trip page.  I like it better than TripIt and Wonderlog. | I'm a longtime user of TripIt but just switched over and it's 95% of what I was using before. The one (very odd) omission is that when importing flights, for some reason Tripsy doesn't read the name of the passenger—there doesn't even seem to be a field within Tripsy to store that information. It's a very strange product choice, as it can create confusion when a single trip contains multiple flights for multiple people. I emailed the developer about this but didn't get a response. Anyway, it's not quite a dealbreaker and I'm otherwise really happy with Tripsy—a great translation of TripIt's functionality into a beautiful, Apple-native experience. | La aplicación es hermosa estéticamente. Para mí nunca funcionó porque quise compartir el itinerario, el cual me tardé demasiado capturando, para que nunca pudiera compartirlo. Me salia un mensaje que estaba sincronizando con su nube y nunca lo pude compartir. En una lástima, pero tuve que regresar a TripIt. 😔 | I am a Tripsy Pro subscriber and like this app. I use it for dozens of shared trips a year. But it has major problems with editing events. 

Half the time edits don't stick and you close out of an item and find it totally unchanged on your itinerary. 

Time zone support is also a disaster. Time changes don't stick, trips and events move around the world from time zone to time zone. There's no consistent anchor or method to handling and entering times. 

Perhaps all the problems relate to the way the app stores data. Its sync just doesn’t work well and you need to be aware that data loss can occur. Sometimes events revert to previous versions hours after a change was made. If you move an attachment from one event to another, sometimes the attachment will simply disappear; it is neither on the old event nor the new. Sometimes you simply cannot change the time of an event no matter what you do.

Usability and UI design could really use some work. | Setting an itinerary is an exercise in frustration as destination times refuse to save at least 40% of the time. When they do save, the app decides to change dates on relaunch. Needs work.

4/13 And latest update broke the widgets. Sigh | The design of the app is definitely 5 stars. Where the Tripsy is legging no live updates on flight delays or gate changes, other similar apps provide that info. | Takes so much stress out of traveling, especially with a group. Love this app and wouldn’t want to travel without it. | Tripsy is by far the most advanced and user-friendly travel planner that I've used so far and I do not know how there could be an app better. It also is a Macbook friendly app, which is a HUGE plus. Definitely recommend! | Tipsy has many positive features to organize travel. For the most part I really like the app, but there’s one glaring flaw.
When a 5:30am wake-up time becomes 3:30 am, for no good reason except that Tripsy wants to send “emergency “ notifications on the watch that a gate has been assigned or changed, the missing sleep makes this app so. Not. Worth. It.
I have my watch and phone in sleep mode. Only emergency notifications should come through. But Tripsy manages to get them buzzing me anyway. I don’t know why or how, nor can I find a setting to turn it off. II just know that I’ve lost more than a few nights of good sleep before travel due to this bug.
“Why are you wearing your watch at night?” —> sleep monitoring and afib monitoring. 
An app that is this disrespectful of the importance of sleep doesn’t deserve more than two stars, no matter how good or bad it is otherwise. | I love having all trip details in one place, and it’s made convenient to forward confirmation emails to the app and automatically on my phone calendar.  It would be useful to have a pre trip checklist of things I need to do and a place for a packing list. 

I like having a trip history to refer to later if traveling to the same place again. It would be helpful to have a section to rate the restaurant, museum, etc after to help jog my memory for recommendations or if a restaurant is worth a repeat visit. | As I sit here loading EACH and EVERY RESERVATION by Hand, MANUALLY, I absolutely wonder WHAT exactly, I am paying for????
I Can do this MUCH EASIER in my Calendar, Except for the ""supposed to be"" ease of seeing it all on one page? NOT HAPPENING, YET! 
Certainly there has to be a better way. | I am planning our anniversary trip, and I have to say this app is awesome. It not only allows me to add everything to a quick view schedule, but also allows me to add documents that I normally had to rewrite not notes on other apps. Ir can find your flights, carrier, hotel and resort! All in a nicely laid out interface. I use it on an iPad Mini and it looks awesome. | I love I can organize stuff for myself and collaborate on trips with my wife, and it supports everything. Tours, cruises, restaurants, adding files and photos, everything. And lots of clever features sprinkled throughout. Fantastic app. | I've been using TripIt (Pro) for years, but I've always found its interface cumbersome and confusing. While TripIt's new interface is better, I much prefer Tripsy for all my travel planning and tracking.  

Tripsy's clean visual design is beautiful and efficient. The main screen displays the most essential information for my trip or, when traveling, for the current leg of my journey. Details for any portion of the trip are usually just a click away. Tripsy has all the main features that you'd expect from a travel app, such as multiple ways to gather travel documents into a trip (search email, forward an email, Mac/iOS sharing, etc), integration with device calendars, support for multiple travelers and non-traveling planners, document upload, etc. TripIt still has an edge in integrations with other travel apps or services. I suspect Tripsy will add more partnerships as they grow and develop. If there is something you want or need to do in TripIt, Tripsy has the option to sync from  TripIt automatically. I used this option when I started using Tripsy, which made that initial transition (or even a trial) so much easier because I didn't need to reimport my documents for planned trips. 

Tripsy lost a few points in this review because of a few areas where it took effort to accomplish some tasks. There are some quirks in importing the cruise portion of a trip. Most cruise data was imported without a hitch; however, it didn't grab the departure time for days in port. I tried manually adding the departure times for a day in port, but it was annoyingly complex. I'd open the detail for a particular day, but I needed help figuring out how to add the departure time, or when I did, I could only choose from predetermined times. Eventually, I found that I had to select a predetermined time, save the changes, open the details again, scroll down to the proper date of my trip and then I could finally set the appropriate time. This problem doesn't happen often, but it is currently a pain. 

Overall, though, I love using Tripsy!! It is now my go-to travel app. | It really helps plan trips and only one person needs a subscription for everyone to collaborate in the app for a trip. | overall great program.  needs a slight interface overhaul (each day should be very subtle different color than others to easily differentiate them).  And I would highly recommend a calendar view. | If you have an itinerary already defined, this app may help document it.  But if you're actually planning and exploring options, it will get slow you down and make a mess in your calendar database.  Also, I got billed for a month even though I cancelled quickly. | Here are my issues so far-- 1) Multiple times, the entries I have put in and saved change on their own. Train times, for instance, will modify themselves to whatever they want (right now I have a train entry that leaves at 8:42PM and arrives at 8:42PM, despite putting in the accurate times). It is not a time change issue, either, they're just random times and AM/PM. This is very annoying and I'm about to give up on this tool. 2) We're flying halfway across the world and you have to scroll to see the map entirely, no way to zoom out and show the whole trip on the screen. You can zoom in...but you can't zoom out to show Florida and Australia on the same map screen. 3) I subscribed to a monthly plan and was surprised to have recently been charged for a year's access. It just seems like ""Save"" doesn't mean what you think it does in this app. I was really excited to get organized, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere, like TripIt. | Unable to even put in dated. Date Screen does not scroll to find the correct month. Figures a work around but once I put in the ending date, the program changes the start date so the trip is ony 1 day....unless I set the trip up without dates but it is difficult to add places for the new days. | 如果加上每段行程花费多少钱这个功能就更好了 | Tried to change to this because I was over trip it. Not pulling in the text from the email and when I search for what I need it keeps showing something in the wrong country. No thanks. Making my life harder | This product can do more to help plan for your vacation than the free platforms. Both this company and apple customer service are unwilling to listen and help resolve my issue with this platform. | This is a great travel planner APP. It works very well and is reliable. Their customer service is excellent as well. If you are looking for a travel planner APP with a lifetime purchase, just try this one! | I am offering 4-stars in this review solely based on the apps' potential and the current user interface design friendliness. The apps' current state and functionality is actually about a 2-star. I hope to update this review shortly to full 5-star based on some things getting taken care of.
Easier itinerary control - went to manually add (I didn't have easy access to the email), a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport for an early flight, and I couldn't do that because the app had already defined the trip as Thursday to Tuesday based on the flight, with me trying to add a Wednesday ""activity"". I had to go into the settings for the itinerary and change the beginning date. (A further annoyance, rather than just changing one date, once I set the new start, it also required the ending, rather than keeping it on the same by default. There should be a way when adding an activity to go “outside the dat boundary” and have the app automatically update the overall itinerary timeframe.
Side-note to above… The share-to-Tripsy function in the Hilton app only brought hotel name and phone number, not the booked dates, res# or other actual booking details - another potential fix? I don’t know if that is Tripsy not importing correctly, or Hilton not exporting & sharing properly.
Better functionality required for the planning part of a trip. Right now, this app just kind of “catches” all the emails you forward it (or painfully add in manually). When you think of booking a trip, say a vacation getaway, there are many pieces to it (the very reason for this app). Resort, flights, transport from airport to resort, excursions while there, maybe a pre-trip hotel stay near the airport with park-and-fly arrangements. Not all that stuff is booked at once. So being able to easily add in each aspect that needs to be booked, and then have each of those activity icons color-coded on the itinerary page (ie. Red for needs booking, yellow for booked, green for booked and pre-paid) really is necessary. Being able to manually change the color of each activity icon would be a simple step. More complex would be adding in 2 checkboxes in the activity (or right-click / hold-click pop up menu) to indicate when it is booked and when it is paid. Next level of complexity would be for the app to automatically color code based on the details provided in the activity (company and res # fields filled out automatically determines “booked” status, I’m not sure how it would determine paid).
 
Again, overall I like the direction this app is going, but it really needs these updates to become the true “Go-To Travel Planner”. Currently, it is leagues beyond it’s main competitor. Enough that I subscribed to Pro for a year. But without these necessary changes, that subscription will not get extended. Yes, those changes are that necessary, and without them I will go back to Excel and OneNote to manage all my travel, as the app would be missing the “ease” functionality that it should have vs. a more manual process.
Hopefully the devs read this and put these ideas in place very soon. I am sure they have a “roadmap”, but for true traveler functionality, these need to be inserted in the immediate stages of that roadmap.
Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!!! | Several of my trips that are complete on one device are showing up as one-day trips on days where I don’t have travel planned. For example, if I have a trip planned from 11-17 March, the trip shows up as 25-25 March on other devices and shared links. None of the activities are syncing across devices. Reached out to support several weeks ago but haven’t heard back and the issue still hasn’t been fixed. Just know that paying for the premium features is worth it when it works, but if it stops working you’ll be dealing with awful customer support. I’ve also never been able to get the import function to work. I like the interface though. | 地图可以增加高德和百度吗？以及板块如果可以自定义就好了，比如我，只想用 app 收集餐馆。旁边的证件对我来说没什么用。我相信有这样需求的人也不少。

""Can maps include options for Amap (高德) and Baidu (百度)? Additionally, it would be great if users could customize categories. For example, I might only want to use the app to collect information about restaurants, and licenses nearby are not relevant to me. I believe there are many users with similar needs."" | A great app that keeps all your travel plans in one place. A suggestion - would you please consider adding a feature that allows me to set to-do reminders for my trip? It would would be so helpful to be able to set a reminder then later received a push notification. Thank you!! | I was a long time TripIt user and Tripsy is better in every way imaginable | I had been searching for a good itinerary app ever since Google Trips shut down years ago. Tripsy is the best one I've used since then. The auto-import by email (for flights, hotels, cars etc) works great and has only gotten more reliable over the year I've been using it. The iOS and Mac apps are both super easy to use and visually appealing. | have you considered adding a ""packing list"" feature for our trips? | This is a great app. I have used it on multiple trips and I can’t live without it now. The only thing missing is that I would like a way to keep a packing list with a quantity field. So I can always make sure I have everything ready prior to a trip and before a return. | Sadly, was hoping this would be app that might work to share itinerary with other humans traveling with me without them having to buy. Nope. Also, had to manually enter 4 of 6 flts and 1 hotel. Even when trying to share from hotel app to create event had to manually enter data. All of this would be fine but when share itinerary with others it does not provide any details (times of flights, flt #, resv etc | Just got it and it provides no guidance as to how to use the app, how to upload reservations; adding guests seems impossible.... | This app is pretty good and very helpful. However I wish the native Mac app felt more Mac-like. As it is, it feels very much like a big iPhone app. I was hoping that planning my trip and making adjustments would have been much easier on my Mac, but I feel the UI and workflow is very limited since it feels like it is a scaled up iPhone app that does not adequately take advantage of the Mac. It is very good, but I wish it could better take advantage of what the Mac can allow for productivity! | Good app and looking forward to using it for future trips.  Would greatly appreciate a field for cost/expense.  We like to work withina budget and this would greatly help. | Searching and adding a flight is too clunky, taking too many steps. The whole UI feels huge like the buttons are massive, but it doesn't make it more usable. You can have different dates than your flights and it doesn't auto update the actual trip dates. You can accidentally add the same flight twice. Buttons aren't labeled, making the intended flow unclear. Basically feels like a more manual version of Kayak, since I'm not paying for the pro version so I can't do email sync. | I download Mac App and iPhone app. At first I ran into problem where the trip from Mac app does not sync. I email support and the Co-Founder responded to me and help diagnose the issue really fast. In face I never had this fast response from app developer before. And the step to diagnose and communication this is straightforward and sincere.

Apart from that, the app has intuitive user interface and easy to understand and can sync with multiple devices and with friends whom I shared the trip with. This eliminated the need to manually create initerary, which reduce times and free us to explore the activities instead. | Wowww. What a good travel app. Very easy going and with all the information and set up for the best experience travel management | I decided to try the app out because I'm looking for an app that can handle travel planning and has a nice UI, which this one does. 

However I noticed while creating an account that the form fields aren't labeled correctly so you can't auto-generate a password from Keychain.This is coming from a developer so I know how easy it is to integrate those small security features in form fields. This was the first red flag. 

So I made a temporary password and I thought I'd change it afterwards to a more secure password, but there's no option to change my password in the app? I read the other reviews about the support being non-existent, along with the developer not responding to feedback in the app store reviews makes me not trust the construction of this app, or being able to get basic support if something goes wrong (keep in mind this app has paid features). I just deleted the app after deleting my account. | The interface is beautiful but the actual implementaion is terrible. Tried several times to add an event and itinerary and it never showed up. I might have even duplicated the subscription in trying to fix the issue. My reccomendation is to go with TripIt. Not as pretty but it works. | Pro user here for a few years now. I absolutely love the planning aspect but the number of unresolved bugs is incredibly frustrating. Support is nonexistent, you won’t get an answer for weeks. There are issues with timezones, findings things, flight schedules, sync and many others. Each update breaks something. I am really unhappy at this point and will not renew our subscription next year. | A really solid travel organization app. All the nice features you want. If you travel it’s easily worth the subscription price. | I love this app and use it constantly. It has been a game changer for me. Very much appreciate the regular improvements. | I would have probably signed up for the paid service and enjoyed the app. However, I found a charge on my card via my apple account before ever using the app. Canceled subscription. | I have used this app twice this year - a two week trip to Spain, and a five week road trip of the east coast of the united states.  In both cases, I found myself a slave to the app. The cost of setting up parts of a trip, in terms of effort, was much greater than the benefit I got from it. I put this app in a drawer and only pulled it out occasionally. I am happy to let this infernal subscription expire until I MAYBE want to use it again in two years.

I like the app, kinda. It looked good at first. It is good at organizing itineraries, as long as those itinerary are AirBnB and organized tours and have a rigid order that will NEVER change. Other parts of my travel plan, like mapping, seem forced and clunky. I had to find ways to do these outside this app.

After a while I started treating this app as a wallet that held a collection of ideas. Adding and removing things from the itinerary took WAY too much effort. Items simply didn't like to move.

I guess I am not their target market. It is too much of a marginal benefit for me keep paying for. It would be worth a fixed charge with paid upgrades, but this is in no way such a life-changing app that I want to keep paying and paying for it. A folder with a collection of links and copies of my reservations works just as well.

Subscription cancelled. | It does not sync with phone and laptop and my phone is missing trips that i put on my laptop!
PLEASE FIX BECAUSE I LOVE THIS APP IF IT WOULD SIMPLY JUST DO THAT | I've been looking for something like Tripsy for a long time.  the closest thing has been tripit but Tripsy seems setup to add the functionality to be the travel suite everyone will use.  It does a pretty good job parsing emails but my AirBB reserveration didnt work. There doesnt seem to be an option for it monitor emails automatically.   It would be nice to be able to drag items from one day/time to another.   The search functionality for new evetns works well.   I love the map feature.  The whole app is worth it for this feature.    Support has been super responsive.  I'm looking forward to growing with them.  Finally theyre doing what no one else could. | I only see, weekly, monthly and yearly as option but not lifetime | Such a great app - but I wish it had 2 small things:

1. The ability to hide flight paths on the map view. I dont want the map to always default to a zoomed out view that doesn’t show many much relevant detail of the stuff I have planned in my actual destination 

2. The ability to add a location to the itinerary on a certain day, without having to assign it a specific time. I.e. “I want to go here on the second day of my trip, but I don’t care specifically

When I was planning my trip,  I put in more then 20 stops, because I was trying to see what all my options were in terms of activities, restaurants, and hotels. I meant to remove some of the stops, but before I could, without warning, the app locked my trip and is demanding more money for me to unlock it. I spent a lot of time planning my trip.  I booked my hotels, now I can’t go back and see what I did unless I pay more money! That’s so mean. I now have to plan everything out again, because I refuse to pay a ransom for my trip. I was having so much fun before this happened and I was going to recommend this app to everyone, but this experience took the wind out my sails. If I were you, I’d try and find another company, because I feel this company is a bit deceptive and unethical to lockdown my hard work without warning or a grace period….at least on my first trip so I could figure out how they’re system worked. Such a shame. | Trick you into membership and offer nothing unless it is premium.  You have to scroll in super close to see any attraction and can not see large overview of the area on the map.  Makes it impossible to discover something new.  Total waste of my money for a basic membership. | I’ve had trips planned and had access. Even if an email was sent, I should always have access to my previous trips while paying to use the app.  Prices increased , and trips are now limited as well as stops. I no longer can access my past trips that I’ve paid for and created. Currently, prices keep increasing you now you have to purchase plans. I will no longer use this app. You should have access to your past planned trip! Greed!! I no longer recommend based on continuous price increases for the same access that I use to have. | This app auto renewed at $36 but all the features that were once available have been removed. Even though I paid $36, it  requires  an up charge to actually create a road trip.  Google maps is much better and free.  I’ve been a subscriber for several years and every year the app has less and less features and costs more.  I’d never recommend it. It is worthless.  I can’t even access my previous trips.  What  is the point of charging me a subscription?  I feel completely ripped off. | Really hard to use and lots of spam. Even after unsubscribing | I love Roadtrippers. I use it to plan and route all my road trips. It’s so easy to add n take away waypoints to plan accordingly. It shows highlights and shows off the beaten path places within your distance you tell it. Shows mileage, hours, and even estimated gas cost which is pretty close. | Took us to places that were so fun and all the choices it gave!! Love this app | Little to no Help available. App navigation is a nightmare! | What a huge disappointment!  We have recommended this app to many friends and used it for numerous trips since 2021.  We ultimately subscribed in 2022 at $29 per year for the unlimited stops and completed one cross country road trip in excess of 10K miles.  The features to find interesting stops were what sold us on renewing again in 2023.  We completed another major Northeast road trip last summer and when we were notified the price was increasing to $35.99 a year we felt it was still worth it for the memories we were creating.  Now when I went in to share a previous trip with a friend I find that all my past road-trips are locked and to view them I have to pay more money.  The new tiers reduce the number of stops per trip to barely what was allowed with the previous free version (20 stops vs 15 stops).  They say they notified people of the change, but I cannot find an email alerting to the drastic reduction in capabilities for a significantly higher membership subscription.  The FAQ page states no refunds are available so I guess I am stuck for another year with a useless subscription (I have fixed my automatic renewal).  I do feel the company was not straightforward with warning existing customers with the severity of impact that was coming (losing access to all previous trips, reduction of waypoints per trip, etc).  This was really masked when they gave you the same capabilities for the remaining subscription period. Very poor customer service and loyalty to existing paying customers! They way to fix this is to restore access to previous trip that were purchased under previous plans and give an additional transition period for previous paying customers.  When we discussed our journeys with friends and mutual road-trip enthusiasts, we always provided raving reviews about this app.  Instead of having an ambassador for their company, they have now created someone who will trumpet their deceptive business practices! | Please help me cancel my subscription. I am not using this. It did not work the way I thought it would. | Love this app - the camera quality is amazing. Use this everyday | This app was great in 2018, I did the week trial a couple weeks ago and within an hour I quickly realized that the app was much different and far less helpful than it once was. Ultimately used google for everything I needed.  Now being a few days beyond the week trial period I’ve thrown money away because they’d rather have a bad review than issue a refund from a polite email. Too bad. | I am having so much trouble figuring this app out! | I used to absolutely love this app, used it on a few trips from CA to TX. But like all good things, now they want to charge you an arm and a leg to use it and there is no monthly option! I’m not paying $80/year for a 7 day trip. Might be worth it for anyone taking 4+ trips a year but why in the world can’t it offer a monthly option? Won’t even let me look at my old trips now without paying and no free options at all any more. 👎🏼 | I’ve used this app for over a year and i was pretty satisfied with it To be honest.
Then when i got requested to renew my plan (which i was about to) i noticed that not only the prices went significantly up but also the features included shrunk and i would need to get the most expensive plan in order to get back access to my older trips.
This is disappointing and made me not renew my plan yet.
Pretty bad move guys! | Not only did this app give us bad information during our cross-country move, they will renew your subscription without any warning whatsoever. Basically, they think their customers are suckers and treat you as such. It wasn’t worth the price I paid a year ago when I actually tried to use it, and it certainly isn’t worth the price to have them sneak the charge through without giving you the opportunity to opt out. If your business model is to rely on people to forget about their renewals rather than to provide a product or service that people WANT to continue paying for, then your business is a failure. | I expected Roadtrippers to be a source of information about places we plan to visit on an upcoming roadtrip but instead of being an interactive guide I can only set a trip place A to Place B and a map is shown between those two places. We are planning more of a wander to get from A to B looking for interesting spots to visit on the way, restaurants, local interest, but this doesn’t seem to be what Roadtrippers is about. Glad I only paid the introductory price. | Fine | The app is amazing ive been using it for 3 years now, recently the pricing structure changed since i only do 1 roadtrip yearly it didnt make sense for me to pay for the premium tier, so now i have a trip already planned that i spent 10s of hours putting together which i cannot view anymore unless i upgrade to premium.

I understand when services beed to go up but this is not the way to it. I did reach out to customer support to atleast be able to view my trip that i already created so i can copy it down or something which they refused, 

unbelievable! | I had used this app before and signed up for the trial to test it out again. Meh. Frustrated that the expensive annual subscription went through a week later with no courtesy reminder or anything. I know this is how they get your money, but it’s really soured me on the app. I’d be much more happy to give them my money if it was a monthly subscription so there was a lower buy-in for short trips. | I absolutely LOVE this app (and the desktop website). I could go on and on.l about it. I’ve used it to plan out three mega road trips for me and my boys and without RoadTrippers, my drive would have been boring and predictable.

If I had just used Google maps I would’ve stopped at a theme park, a zoo, maybe an overlook. Instead we found an insane and unknown rock formation, the actual grave of Dr. Pepper, a tiny military museum in a tiny town, a parrot sanctuary and a trail of cherry blossoms in peak bloom.

I love that you can collaborate with others that aren’t premium members. I love adding stops along my trips and having the driving/mileage info for each stop. I love seeing reviews and photos within the app so I don’t have to go googling. I love it all.

I got my mom onto the app and now she has used it twice as well to plan a regular road trip and an RV road trip. Apparently, the app shows where RV hookups are and is a dream for traveling with an RV.

Never going anywhere without checking this app first!! | Don't try to use this while you're driving you'll get a wreck | The features of the service were nice and very helpful for planning a trip, the real problem is the ridiculous subscription plans. When they first switched to a subscription based model it wasn’t great but it is a helpful app and supporting the developers is total fine, so we were fine with it. Recently they’ve updated the plans again without notice, and has locked us out of almost all of our trips that we had already planned (with no way of accessing them other than to buy a new subscription model). Finally just switched to google maps because it’s free and can save our trips without fear of no being able to access them. | You have to pay and you can only pay annually. | Stop the spam!!!! | Stopped along my route at a wayside rest area.  Without touching the phone, it then rerouted us back 14 miles onto a route that was about 100 miles longer.  Sorry I ever subscribed | Seems fairly straightforward and intuitive. Still early but I like it. | I’ve had this app on my iPhone (fairly new iPhone) for about an hour and it’s already crashed a dozen times. Every time I try to put in a destination it locks up. Add RV info it locks, try to open up to see what the annual fee is and it locks up. Every time I have to completely close it down and start over. I tried reloading the app and it does the same thing. I’m going to play with it a little more but if this is how it works I certainly won’t be buying the upgrade or recommend it to anyone
Update: after removing the app and reinstalling it, it’s just as bad as before. | Luckily I caught it before our trip, but this app completely messed up our trip from California to Vancouver. In fact, don't bother with this app if you're going to Canada at all. I spent, not hours, but days meticulously planning a 3 week roadtrip. Only to realize that this app's routes become incomprehensible north of Seattle. | Really enjoying the app so far. But noticed that there’s no option to select French cuisine for travel. Also, for hotel stays, would be great if we can search by hotel brands. | Unable to choose from different routes. Like the ability to find hotels and campsites. | I entered my trip destination and get a blue line indicating the route but it covers over the interstate designation. Major interstate highways are marked and coveted over but no other roads or highways are indicated. When the route has a change from interstate to state, county, other, roads theres no designation as to what road it is. I tried zooming but that was no help. Since I'm not provided a navigational list this app is really of no help to properly get me safely to my destination. So tell me whats the big deal with this app? | You make it impossible to stop renewal you only want to keep my money. The only way I can find to stop the renewal is to cancel what I have paid for. Not good | gotta get a subscription for more than one place on the route bruh | Turn by turn directions are inconsistent and  not enough lead time to make turns.   Does not appear to be Apple phone compatible | I find it difficult to use! | This was acceptable at $30/mth for access to 3 different apps, but when you only camp 6 times a year for it to double its cost for the same functionality, then tier off the value of the app with functions that brought you to the app in the first place is just price gouging. | This is a really good app. Definitely recommend it. Mostly an easy way to put a trip together, plan stops, construct a map. I would give it 5 stars except for a few very frustrating things that drag this app down. And could easily be fixed. I do understand that maybe it’s user error, but … When you are on a trip, you open the trip and it goes to your current location in Map View. However, when you open the List View for that trip, why doesn’t it go to your current location instead of starting from day one and you have to scroll all the way down until you find what you’re looking for. The way dates are managed is a complete nightmare. Changing the dates of an entire trip is such a hassle. And you cannot plan a trip without dates as once you add your first date, the app puts every single waypoint on a separate date!! Who thought that was a good idea?! You can add things that are not on the map already, but you can only add an address, you cannot label the address as to what it is. There are a lot of things that are not included on the map that I would like to add to my trips. And label with a name. This app is not a standalone app. You need other sources to complete the picture. Especially because there is a blue line indicating your route that completely covers up the highway numbers. Highway numbers are essential to trip planning. Also, can you update the gas pricing? It’s no where near accurate. And organize the trips into past and upcoming/future? | G Maps and this nav system come up with  same routes which is not conducive for RVs.  The previous togo rv nav system was way better | Not easy to start navigation - ridiculously hard to do. | Interesting app. Paid the $60 fee and used it for a single road trip. Was pretty useful at setting up driving routes and ranges, similar to the old AAA TripTik. Found some good restaurants and museums along the way. 

But it has mediocre UI/UX. It dumps a bunch of OTHER people’s road adventures into the place where you store yours. Whenever you open it, you have to go digging for the trip(s) you’re working on because Roadtrippers figures you more likely want to see what others have done in an area you aren’t even visiting and that’s more important than your own trip! 

Think about asking a friend to hand you your hammer and instead they hand you random other tools in your box until eventually your hammer shows up. And they repeat that over and over. Wouldn’t be relying on that friend for help, even worse if I were paying them. And that’s how I feel about the experience of Roadtrippers- $60 a year to have it throwing up random adventures from other people when I bought it to focus on my own trip(s) is absurd. I can find plenty of these types of stories in more detail on YouRube or other websites- I’m paying for this subscription for a “professional” tool that focuses on MY road trips. Far too much noise and clunky navigation. 

The reason it went from a 3-star experience to a 1-star rating: apparently it’s rigged to make it impossible or near impossible to turn off the subscription. You follow a link from the app to log into their website, go to “manage subscription” or “turn off auto renewal,” and it takes you to yet again ANOTHER website for a company called “Stripe.” And does “Stripe” let you manage your subscription or turn off auto renewal? NOPE. Stripe wants you to put in your email and they claim they will “send a link” so you can log in. And the link is good for 30 minutes. BUT- the link never arrives. Tried it twice. So, Roadpass/tripper and Stripe have apparently designed a rat trap where they can claim to let you turn off auto renewal, but there is no way to do so. 

Come the end of my subscription and if they try charging again, it’ll be an instant chargeback with my bank. These sorts of schemes need to be called out for the fraud they are. And Apple may need to be advised this is going on behind the scenes, even though it’s a useful app, the trickery in preventing cancellation is abhorrent. | I was on auto renew. The price last year was 29.99 for unlimited plans with unlimited stops. It renewed for 35.99. Five more dollars, OK. But for three trips with 20 stops each. All the trios except for one have a lock sign on them, so the app isn’t even registering that I am a paying customer. There was no notice or email that the plan was changing. And of course no refunds. Will NOT be renewing | Used this app for the first time and it DID NOT take us to our Destination. Don’t trust it now and won’t use it again. Good thing my Trailer is on the small side or I would have had issues. | Killer app just learn how to used this app and it is worth every penny | This is annoying. I have logged out and logged back into my account but cannot see the trip I created on my desktop computer through the phone app. The phone app is not recognizing my user name or email and will not allow me to update it. Spent $60 on the annual membership for the premium package. | roadtrippers and campendium are supposed to be merged, but there is no campendium info here. | Very hard to understand what you actually have access to. Tried to sign up for all 4 apps but found out I only got Roadtrippers not Togo and Campendium like I wanted
Dallas Willard | Seems like developers might have forgotten about this project? I put in a 1,200 mile road trip and it couldn’t find a single gas station, a single hotel, almost anything really. It found 3 major historic land marks that almost everyone in the world has heard of… so whats the point of this app then? And you want people to pay for something as well? It’s scary to see junk like this being advertised. Seriously, I feel like i’m living in the movie idiocracy sometimes. | Wow, I couldn’t even figure out how to use this app before I ran out of free tries and they wanted me to pay for the upgrade. Why do they assume you want to plan a trip starting from your house? I wanted to find out what things there were to do once I leave Austin on my way to Marfa in a couple of months. It kept putting my current location there and wouldn’t let me search between two points any other way. That’s how I lost all my free whatever they called them. Boo for this app. They don’t even explain how to use it properly! Nowhere at all do they explain me what I need to do. Going to delete it from my device!",4.64842,58911,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/39/21/6a/39216a7a-62c9-769a-14f1-646a542e3470/db767308-f79e-4a71-8720-d577012636ee_AppStore_SS_iPhone_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/41/d0/dc/41d0dce2-6206-fe76-9910-3657284e17ba/70f2abc4-cef7-464b-a27a-acd34a4e1526_AppStore_SS_iPhone_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/12/00/52/1200523f-c011-c13f-5643-bcbcdc1409bb/216fa624-676b-46ec-8868-4c81e706e624_AppStore_SS_iPhone_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/61/35/66/6135669d-79e6-5a09-e358-0b363e05791f/3f48ef0d-d3f7-4378-9afa-5627ea64e682_AppStore_SS_iPhone_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2f/1d/5d/2f1d5d72-5078-a31d-578d-bb3f3b3d4ba6/d3119d00-2327-4651-9873-c1c97695762b_AppStore_SS_iPhone_05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/eb/16/10/eb161041-f7bc-351c-8d57-b733591711e7/8f81a9ab-56cf-4fb7-a592-08c9c5932a5b_AppStore_SS_iPhone_06.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6e/4b/95/6e4b958d-b197-0231-a608-32006b6a02b9/7c807b90-32d2-4ec0-aaf2-892c6d2772d4_AppStore_SS_iPhone_07.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/24/f4/05/24f40598-b82e-d075-2e1a-1d9df14fedfb/5a02c4c0-1990-49f3-988b-98d7eabbebe1_AppStore_SS_iPhone_08.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/26/e7/47/26e74752-527d-2030-7466-c94cbf31316b/78336ff5-b577-4c8f-b0a0-e12cc5c5ebb0_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_01.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/de/2b/84/de2b843c-29bb-78f4-53b7-8fc59e25e0ca/da334249-1ce7-4a7d-8cdd-0d4fe8653843_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_02.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/50/01/99/50019906-25ce-8f4f-4ea6-787a695f94af/95bc4514-fbfb-4b95-ad42-4c81118d7dcd_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_03.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c6/7f/b3/c67fb383-2bf1-1217-f17a-d9df4c0652d0/f50a3dd9-761c-43a3-b5bb-f302572c91ff_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_04.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/df/43/51/df4351f1-10a5-8417-ebb0-32e060bbf8c2/5fdc7054-4e11-41ef-a18c-dd23df735736_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_05.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a0/9d/69/a09d69ce-163d-b4e3-5f73-a8bd646aec07/163b3d55-e773-4d35-a199-750188fe2a74_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_07.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2d/8d/d1/2d8dd1f3-6ff0-422d-35f2-492d8367ea77/16833734-9815-4911-9702-88a5557d25c8_AppStore_SS_iPad_3_08.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPa

I even typed “store” into the search bar, but it just said “no results”.  Went with another app called TripIt.  Much better. | This app seems abandoned. Last update was a year ago. Most contents in the app just wouldn’t load. Nearly unusable. | Planning a trip to the Ark Encounter in Williamstown Ky and the Creation Museum in Petersburg Ky.  Neither available. 

So not very helpful for us trying to plan a vacation. Will try again someday. | I used this app in Paris, great. However, when I tried to use it in Portland ME, I could not find Portland Head Light, one of the oldest lighthouses in America, commissioned in 1791 by George Washington. There is no way to add manually. We can only add what’s already there. Need to update please. | Very short overview.   Limited content. | If you’re into 70%+ of their posts being TikTok videos that they share, along with nondescript titles or descriptions, cool I guess. But that’s literally all it is, along with the thumbnails/ previews all being broken. 
Trash. | It won’t let me change “searching in xx” if I try to switch the card pulls up from bottom of screen then immediately goes back down. Unable to swap and use a big portion of the app’s functionality. | It has a really nice interface, easy information at a glance! It’s really helpful and I can see myself using it in the future. It doesn’t have Istanbul, which is my upcoming trip, though. Would be nice! Thanks, lots of potential! | It seemed easy at first. I want to have hotels, museums and restaurants in my itinerary. The app couldn’t locate one restaurant. Also, I set up an itinerary and the app lost all the information so I would have to start over. | Like the idea. Unfortunately it is Very buggy. I can’t search what I want. And the design is not very intuitive | Don’t bother, this app is designed to serve ads and collect personal info in exchange for doing basic google searches. | Great idea and app, has great potential if the searches were more up to date | Literally just an app for bookmarking travel spots.  Obvious features that would make it far more useful such as notes, personal ratings, and being able to jointly share itineraries are missing. | I cannot recommend this app. The last update wiped my itinerary! Now I’m hoping support fixes it before I need to rebuild it all. 

I feel dumb for not taking screenshots of each day. But I liked the flexibility of changing my plans in here. | No se cómo manejar bien el app, para mi falta información de su manejo. | This app has no original content.   It just refers you to other articles and links filled with advertisements.   Stick with apple guides if you’re looking for crisp, well curated guides | Nothing original about this and they post terrible content all on Instagram. They just use other people’s work! | This app has a lot of good content, but the amount of notifications this app spams you with is absolutely insane. I heard a lot of good things about this app, so I just downloaded it the other day and I’ve been immediately bombarded with 30+ notifications per day. I just looked to see if there was a way to personalize what kind/how many notifications you get and there doesn’t appear to be any options for it. It’s either you get spammed with notifications all day, or you don’t get any at all. Or you just deselect a bunch of things that you’re interested in, but that totally defeats the purpose of the app. I don’t think I’ve ever left a negative review on here before, but I expected much better from such a highly regarded app. | best travel Apps EVER!!! | I couldn’t find anything, and it was much easier to just google locations. The app was much too complicated for my liking. | All this App does is refer you to TicToc or Instagram which I have no interest in adding to my phone. Very little original content. | Almost no useful info for places | Gracias | Kind of pointless. Miss Google Trips. | Too many error messages. Can’t even make a profile to start. App is updated. Just a lousy app | we can for our next one in Fall? | I love love love this app. I even use it when not traveling just to daydream and plan for the future. Love it! | Love it. Best place to get travel inspiration ideas. | Easy to use for travel plans and has lots of good information! | The perfect pocket guidebook for all of my travel needs! Helps feed my wanderlust, plan my upcoming trips and guides me while I’m in my destinations traveling! The content seems to be endless and always updating with the most recent things I should know about where I’m going! ♥️♥️♥️ | Planning a trip to Iceland and it was so helpful.  All the great places to stay and so informative to plan just about everything.    Such a genius idea creating this app.     Thanks Trip Scout | Very helpful | Literally opened the app to use it for the first time and nearly panicked thinking I got my own dates wrong. Calendar isn’t synced, sept is really October’s calendar for example. Event locations not updated to show new location addresses… not really impressed. 

I’ll stick with my old school way of planning. | These are tons of experienced travelers. They don’t take you to the top rated five star restaurant everyone is talking about... they take you to the hole in the wall, home cooked meal that seats a total of 7 people.

I have all the best recommendations and tips for a great vacation right in this app! | By far the most diverse yet organized platform out there for anyone planning to travel, or who travels frequently!! A must have app! | Love this app. Easy to use. Great for trip planning and inspiration. | Huge fan of this app and loving the upgrades!  I recommend this app to all of my traveler friends - backpackers, luxury vacation, solo travelers, family travel, etc - because it is so easy to navigate and sort through based on your own specific travel profile and what fits you as you plan your trip.  When I’m not able to get away, I love reading articles on TripScout’s app and dreaming about future travel! | Incredibly easy to use and packed full of worthy trip planning information.

It’s very easy to use, and the directions they give are detailed and helpful. 

When I used it for my last event, I wasn’t sure if I was at the correct location, I reached out to their team via WhatsApp  and  they replied back to me in less then two minutes.

I will use this app any time I travel abroad ! | This app has completely changed my stress level when planning a trip. It tells me what to see, how to see it, and allows me to put in places I want to see and it will tell me which day its most convenient. | I’ve used Viator for Paris, Seattle, London, Dublin, Boston and more! It’s my GO-TO travel app when I don’t want to miss a thing!!! | It’s about the feeling of belonging. Knowing it’s all going to be ok once you check in. 
The smiles of the personnel, the ambiance, the environment. 
Everything is so cool! | Great app for planning the trip without missing the most important sights and ajustable to your travel length | I love this app.  It truly makes planning a visit to a city EASY!!!  I love how it builds the itinerary based on your timeframe.  Some things i wills look to see as enhancements:
1.  Allow download of plans to be used offline
2.  Allow user to default start times for specific itinerary items
3.  Allow users to select method of going from one point to another (eg. allow me to self walk if i won’t want public transportation)

App is a must have!!!! | I like my privacy thru require you to be tracked through Facebook google and others not just use while using the app  I unstalled fast! | Needs a blurb about each city before the onslaught of tours. I need some insider information - the essentials - about the city, history, weather, geography, best time to go, events, landmarks. I want to read some information before diving into tours. I know they need to monetize the app, but it feels like advertising. | This app can’t seems to find almost any hotels, either by name or by address. | Wish you could add “breaks” in the app like you can on the website also Need to be able to add different hotels on the same itinerary other than that- Make’s planning multi day trips so easy when you have a lot you need to get in and can’t waste time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank you. | It’s a good apps for the trips. I suggest to add direct links to the monuments | We have used this app on several trips in the past couple years.  It is wonderful!!  With the maps, day by day itineraries, and suggestions, we’ve been able to navigate our way through London, Athens, Paris, and now we’re using it to help plan our trip to Rome!  It’s a lifesaver!! | Spinning wheel forever. Worst app in the age of chatgpt | I’ve been using the app for 10 years, I travel A LOT, I adjust times, dates and activities and attractions w easy. Usually I am the lead in my groups and people are always so impressed and satisfied. I set activities that are near eachother for same day, usually hitting one region or area per day. Very seldeom I use public transport, usually all by foot and the map option allows me to plan accordingly. | I have used it all over the world, very good and helpful | The program works well, but I was unable to figure out how to list more than one hotel and use the app to plot which sites to see from each hotel site. Also 10 days is maximum. Limited in allowing you to travel between different cities on the same trip. Nice listings of attractions close to each other and offers a variety of itineraries to adapt to your plans. | Very versatile, flexible, you just choose a city and you have many options to plan accordingly. | Joan did a spectacular tour. His knowledge and perspective of both the city’s history and local color made Barcelona come alive. I definitely recommend this tour and Joan. 25 stars! | That’s the review.. just got a blanked out screen on iPhone. Tried on android the same.. bummer | This app constantly forces you back to the beginning. You’re on day one, every time you go into it you going to go through plan your trip, your plans and then sometimes it’s not your plans but the generic guide they give you constantly reloading.  In your travels this can get really expensive. Also there used to be an offline downloadable map which was amazing. | This app is amazing and it’s a staple for all of my trips. One problem is adding a stop the app doesn’t recognize. I wish we could add an address if the app doesn’t recognize it as a destination. | Freezes constantly. Every few seconds! | I consistently recommend this app to anyone I meet that tells me they are traveling to a new city! It’s incredibly easy to use and flexible. You are sure to optimize your time using it to see top attractions anywhere in the world! | I was thrilled to find this helpful site and even happier with the intuitive way it works.  I have reworked our week in London a couple times and it was easy peesy!  😊 | After long hours of working on my itinerary, I then tried to download and print.   Though it said it had emailed the itinerary to my email address, it never did.   There is no print option, when you select print it just says it emailed it.    Not what I had hoped for. | I’ve used this all over the world, whether on vacation or a short business trip. Best way to be efficient and knowledgeable! | What a great place to start your planning for any trip. Offers such a variety of options and how to pace yourself. | I like the concept, but to get started it’s not user friendly. One I remember how to input everything it’s smoother | One of my favorite travel apps! | The best app ever.  It help me travelled around the world.  Everyone should have it | Truly a phenomenal idea and an amazing app. Thanks to the team. Great job. | I rate this the BEST guide to plan for visits to  any city ! It is very time- saving to visitors! | This | Friendly use | I used it in Italy, New Orleans, San Francisco and more.  It’s awesome.  Saw so much more than I would have been able to with out its direction.  Signed up for tours I never would have known about.  Fabulous! | I have used this program several son the last couple of years.  I love its ability suggest itineraries to Mach the available to see the sites | Fantastic app and I’ve used it to organize and maximize many trips regardless of how long my visit will be! | Nice concept but you need to do a lot of work on this app or website. Can not edit your travel itinerary or move your plans from one day to another.
Can not add “things to do” from the tab into the itinerary, sends you to another site. | this app is so useful and helps so much when seeing a new place especially when it gives you a map overview of all the attractions | Love this app for city planning. | I have been looking for an app to track my trips and add places that I would like to go. This app gives me ideas by setting up itineraries for me and allows me to adjust them to fit my needs. One thing that I would like to see is the ability to change the actual times. We made reservations for dinner and I may I am not able to change the time for that particular item without adjusting the length of the time I’m at other places. | I’m just gonna say it—the interface is kind of trash! There’s a lot of functions that would be nice, convenient, and rational to have that aren’t there, and if they ARE there, they’re not intuitive to find at all. It also gives me clunky mapquest vibes. 
But—if you like trip planning, it definitely gives you that satisfied feeling once you have your itinerary all filled out. Also, after seeing the website, the app looks a lot better. Happy traveling! | This app has been a godsend for our large family, as we have been traveling in Europe! It is a first rate idea generator, even suggesting a sensible itinerary. Not only that, but when we had difficulty with tickets from a vendor the app listed, the Cisit a City customer service stepped up to get us a refund. Exceeded my expectations! | I love looking at Visit-a-City to identify the sites in a particular location. And I have been able to find some great tours and activities to book. | We use visitacity to map out our trips.  It p provides  an easy to follow itinerary.  If you are a planner, this is the App for you. You will not be disappointed. | I love this app!I have used it for international multi country trips as well as trips within the USA. You put in the where and when and your planning is almost done for you!  I would highly recommend this app for anyone traveling whether you have kids, want to relax or go and see everything! | I admit I found it much easier to use website to plan the trip then the app.  I tried tons of travel planners and this is the best site.  Once you have the plan done, you can share it or for me being old school, I printed it for a hard copy.  There are areas it can improve on, but compared to other apps, this easy.

I had to email them with a technical support and they were awesome.  Download it and give it a try, but remember the website is easier to do the initial plan.  5 stars me is odd, but this app deserves it. | This app is awesome! I am a international flight attendant and i use it everywhere I go! | I’ve used this app in several cities and have found the itineraries excellent for planning. I would recommend it to anyone | If you want a decent travel itinerary this is THE APP, an excellent app. I did the 13 days in Italy just as planned, one of the best trip ever.

This was our first experience in South East Asia and truly left a lasting impression. | It was a wonderful excursion. We enjoyed all of it. From the mountain views to the monastery it was all an experience. | Great tour to Mt. Rainier. Stopped at a number of sites. Our guide Cory was great! | We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of the Vatican with Ella of LivTours!   She was warm, friendly and very knowledgeable with history, art appreciation, and religion (and has a background in archeology!).  If you can afford to go with a small group, do it!  We felt our small group tour was very personal, very pleasant and extremely informative. We saw so many large groups, and we could see the experience was not the same. | This hotel was top of the line for courteous and friendly personnel. The grounds and interior were immaculate and the relaxing atmosphere made the stay outstanding. The choices of food and drinks at the various eateries on site allowed us to enjoy the amenities and not have to leave to locate great dining elsewhere. It was worth every cent we spent. We took home wonderful memories of our experiences here. | I used to love Trip Advisor, but oh how the mighty has fallen.  When I’m trying to find things to do in any given town, sadly I am insistently shown tours and guides, rather than location information.  Tripadvisor is merely a platform for trying to get me to book a tour through them rather than a guide to help me find what I actually wanna see in a particular place.    Their “Things to do” section has become woefully disappointing. On my recent trip to Portugal, Tripadvisor did not really advise me at all. I ended up looking at where the tours took me what they included to figure out exactly where I wanted to go, and then used my Maps program to find out where they were with no help from Tripadvisor. 
Andy The Traveler | i want the old TA BACK!!! | Looking on planning a trip have used this site many times they’re always very good so I’m writing a little review. The past has been pretty good now. We’ll see what happens this next time.,, | Trip Advisor is my favorite way to plan our adventures—in town or away.  

The information is non-biased and accurately describes the various options for dining, lodging and entertainment | I want to especially think the front desk team, Nikhil and Jee for making our stay comfortable and inviting! Nikhil and Jee corrected an issue that we had with our room. This is what makes customer service a satisfying experience. This property used to be a Marriott. Now that it is a Hilton property I’m continually satisfied. | Matteo is a wonderful historian and a great Guide. I recommend using Matteo and
Crown tours to make your stay fun 
and interesting. | Good tour with the right balance of quality and quantity. Could have spent more time at El Escorial but covered most highlights given the time constraints. Valley of the Fallen was a nice side trip that we would not have done on our own. Christiana our guide was excellent. Gave a good balanced commentary about topics that may have political sensitivity. Worth the time and money if you have seen the highlights in Madrid. | Utterly amazed to discover this treasure of artifacts, tables, stools and benches, straight from the wood artisans themselves.  Incredible prices including shipping to the states. I now have 4 beautiful souvenirs from Bali that I will cherish for years. | If you like to cook and learn new cuisines, you’ll love this class.  I’m a chef and enjoyed the experience. It’s a small class (max. 8) and you get a full experience (prepping & cooking) with a market tour of the ingredients you will use during class.  Instructor is friendly, engaging and gives step-by-step guidance in the preparation and cooking of several courses.  You also get a recipe book in print and electronically at the end of class; AND a video of your experience.  Great memory to have.   Transportation: Our driver Dewa was also very nice.  I mentioned something I wanted to find and he took me to a place I could get it. | Trip Advisor is helpful in providing us the best vendors and experiences in our travels based on experience and reviews of others.  TA Takes the unknown out of the selection process.  Thank you. | This was a really chic hotel right in the middle of everything. Young professionals everywhere and excellent accommodations and service. | Not to be missed! It was absolutely wonderful! | This is a great app - other than for whatever reason the people who design the app think it’s a great idea to not let people filter reviews by date (most recent).  I don’t care about reviews that happened two years ago when there are obviously more recent reviews and I’m not interested in reading through 250 reviews to find the most recent.  And by the way, the “last 3 months” doesn’t work.  I tried it and the search result was one review from 11 months ago, even though there was a more recent review.  Please fix this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | This is a great museum for the Merkel, Texas area.  The exhibits include school memorabilia, local police, veterans, and more.  It is well worth the visit!  Just off I-20.  Willie the docent is knowledgeable and friendly with museum visitors. | Just had such an incredible experience skydiving with Skydive Kauai! Dave, the owner, Ben and Taylor, the professional tandem divers, and the pilot were all amazing and so helpful and friendly!! This was in my bucket list and I am so glad I chose to do it in Kauai! The views were spectacular!!! | Delicious food.  Winston was my waiter and he was very helpful with my dinner selection.  Cesar salad was actually a meal as it had grilled chicken in it.  The lasagne was my main entree and I could only eat half!  Would highly recommend this restaurant and Winston! | As a well traveled person, and having once had the function of displaying countries visited on the site, it’s disappointing to see its no longer available. Odd that TA cant incorporate more of Google or at least parts of the world, to allow feedback and reviews.  Over half the towns in Africa I’ve been to, aren’t “allowed” on TA. 
Time to do the full switch to google it appears | The food was not fresh or hot, and they just covered the chicken and brisket with BBQ sauce. The cheddar grits were good. The collard greens were not cooked long enough with no seasoning. | @RACHEDTOHME  #rachedtohme | Combined with a very educational windmill tour, this was a fantastic time for a great price.  Bonus … there was wine. | We had a very nice breakfast at St Regis.  Always delicious food and the service makes the brunch all the better.  Our server was Fahmy and he was very attentive and made sure we had an amazing breakfast.  Definitely recommend | Great coffee, milkshakes and fruit juices. Smoothies to die for! The staff (Antonio, Dominga, Ismael, Olga, Yenny and Neveida) are ALL super attentive to every whim and need! Even brought my 13 year old behind the bar to mix his own special fruit drink! | Sam was a great guide today! She knows all the hot spots to find shark teeth and fossils. Shes very knowledgeable and can tell you what everything is that you find. 

Would highly recommend taking this day tour! | Am amazing, wonderful, relaxing, staff friendly and accommodating that go above and beyond your expectations kind OD resort. Super clean and plenty to drink and eat all day. Food was particularly very good abcs still prepared every. Definitely will be back! | Using Trip Advisor is a great way to ease your mind when traveling. It is user friendly and offers a plethora of options such as food, activities, lodging, etc. when you are traveling. Trip advisor also makes it easy to write reviews and post pictures. Great app to have for any  expert traveller and your beginner traveller. | Leider versuchen wir unser Geld zurück zu erhalten . Da die Leistung nicht erbracht wurde. 
Nun sieht es so aus das wir geblockt werden und auch unsere Bewertung wurde gelöscht . Das ist alles andere als seriös. 
Wir sind wirklich enttäuscht, denn das war ein Geburtstagsgeschenk . | We had Andres as our waiter and he was excellent and served us a wonderful meal at the grill.  
The meal was  very tasty and the flavors were authentic very unique | Waste of time to leave legit reviews. TA likes to remove reviews or reject them. You cannot leave an honest to goodness bad review anymore it seems. No matter how bad a place may seem. | The Parc Bistro on 5th Ave. has a magical feel when you enter and glance down a long neighborhood bar bustling with people and great food. Farò the owner has been in the restaurant business for 30 years I know of. He is warm, friendly and serves wonderful French food. The best dishes and has an extensive wine list. The monthly wine dinners with a winery rep there to discuss their wines are a sellout! Live music weekly and reasonable prices. | Rahul server was excellent…. Very attentive and polite !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great view of burj Khalifa fountains …….,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, great service …. Food very tasty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super nice hostes gave us the best service here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Big selections on the menu food and drinks . Music is amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Friendly environment all over . Feels like home for sure | The app is completely broken, even after updating the app, logging out, logging back in… can’t see any pictures, can’t change my profile picture or see it, can’t share or view itineraries… completely useless now. | Amazing !!!! The Sicilian pie !!!! You won’t be disappointed !! | We stopped at Verona after a yacht trip. Marlon was very attentive and gave excellent recommendations. Everyone was satisfied with their meals. I would recommend. | Never have seen such tight slots.
Our host complained we were not playing much, so we said, your slots are to tight 

Lost a lot of money and made zero

Will visit other Caesars and other states, but not sure I’m gonna be back to Vegas anytime soon | Found the Baixamar seafood restaurant from a recommendation of our hotel desk clerk. The meal was by far the best we experienced on our entire vacation. If you like fresh seafood definitely get the seafood platter for two. Well worth the $ and flavors. | I stay here twice and both times was amazing the guy at the front desk I think his name is siyani but he was the best I’ll stay there a 3 time just off how siyani made me feel | Galo was above and beyond,, dinner was delicious but the service was even better 

We have been coming since 2012 and it’s our favorite spot and experience 

Must try you won’t be sorry ask for Galo | No matter what country I am in any excursion I booked with trip I know it’s a guarantee good time. | I use it to navigate places while on vacation and write reviews as I go. | I always use trip advisor anytime I go somewhere new | The outdoor seating area is by far the best outdoor atmosphere in the Upstate! The indoor area is quirky and unique too and the food is always delicious, the service is consistently great and the menu is more interesting and diverse than most places within hundreds of miles. Whether you’re going for happy hour and appetizers or an amazing lunch or dinner, I can assure you that you won’t be disappointed! | This is one of the best trail rides I have been on. Zip Lining in morning and trail riding in afternoon.  Great day and place. Everyone is pleasant.",4.80115,340924,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/fc/f8/3a/fcf83ae4-f4a2-734f-4748-8bc91ab28fe1/bdc71823-661d-4099-9b12-8c5f46801ac3_0_APP_IPHONE_55_0.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/06/7e/26/067e2684-ae5a-8ac0-5143-4fb7ce5df0f1/cfb8759e-8f17-4dcd-b3ec-86324915fd0b_1_APP_IPHONE_55_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/89/94/91/89949124-e91d-cfb6-d546-ab12d51490f0/ec8b5395-02e8-45b6-8ac4-1de2bccb7db1_2_APP_IPHONE_55_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/70/7b/8a/707b8a3b-aa36-25fa-c043-ed01080f1fb2/39a46680-ebfd-4381-b188-31879dfcc15d_3_APP_IPHONE_55_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d4/42/8b/d4428b97-c48a-ce5e-9141-27cf686f5016/5586b1f1-aa08-4aa5-a339-b87eec58767e_IOS_5.5_-_Eng__U0028US_U0029_frame_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/96/bb/6e/96bb6e84-909b-a966-abaf-92f0c3e5a521/b537dc6b-c166-4369-aa49-aa6be1ff526d_IOS_5.5_-_Eng__U0028US_U0029_frame_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/10/da/9d/10da9dad-b125-4866-6772-699a0ef9279a/5780628f-b0f8-45a2-85ad-3a4c17d03fce_0_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_0.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/07/29/16/07291634-ec4b-2c75-5184-c34889c5d831/0beea523-0db8-4c83-a836-48b905fab26b_1_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e0/b9/0b/e0b90b2c-d222-b191-8be1-44612e68e911/c0e708ac-f2c8-4827-921c-1c0677b4784b_2_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/59/cd/34/59cd3410-946b-9f87-8c8d-197931af9cc0/e9ce74a7-b61f-4b74-8341-6437ea53549b_3_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/7a/32/67/7a32673d-2c4d-5f86-ac7f-866f6856c22d/e18cb3ac-afd9-42aa-a67c-c429c5e26c05_4_APP_IPAD_PRO_129_4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9f/de/83/9fde83f7-270c-e185-0748-af353df3da62/ad14fa24-c116-42db-8b4f-2f44c6e02dff_0.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenC

Those experiences are provided by independent organizations and people and not by Viator.

The app itself is very poorly designed. I wanted to search for tapas tours in Barcelona. If you just enter Barcelona you get 1000s of events, 99% of which are not tapas. You can filter by type of event but it wasn't all that helpful.

So, you try searching for ""Barcelona tapas"" directy. This gives you a list of one line each results. You click on and then want to check another result. So you click back but this takes you all the way to the top of the app, not back to the search results. So you click search again and now you have to manually enter ""Barcelona tapas"" again because the search history only shows the one result you picked, not the search terms you entered? Now you have to try to remember where you left off. Why don't the search results look exactly like the city results???

Other issues include that nothing is copyable. Needed to copy the address. not copyable. Description had urls in it of sites and apps related to the event. They are neither clickable nor copyable so you have to manually memorize them and type them into the browser or app being referenced.

It feels like the problem is the company had fooled itself by the high ratings. Those ratings are not for Viator itself though | We’re seniors and this is our first and most likely our last visit to DC. The convenience of reviewing, selecting and booking tours with Viator is so stress free! | Thank you,
 love being a repeat customer, I feel like you take care of me personally . | I was lucky enough to have a private tour with the very lovely and informative Roy. I enjoyed hearing all about the history of the temples, the mountains and his life here in Cambodia. Highly recommend Roy! | I’m deleting the app as Viator sells me tickets for tomorrow despite my filter for today.  Then, the are worthless in getting you a refund.  

I’ve spent thousands with this app but they put all of the work on their customers while they just step back and count the money.  Zero customer service.
  
Be careful to triple check that date before you purchase. | Even though the code was good through in of month it would not give me the 10 % on the new download app | I love using the Viator app. It’s easy to navigate, has great photos, and quick access to honest reviews. Thank you for making travel even more fun! | After chatting with a rep ,
Imputing my info and cc number numerous times,
I was told to try a different cc. That produced the same result. Then it was suggested I wait 72 hours and try again. As far as holding the time of the tour we selected , they could not guarantee it. In spite of all that I tried one last time , and was successful. 
I hope it’s smooth sailing from now on! | I installed this app two days ago and I am about to delete it. Tried searching for bioluminescent kayak tours near Orlando knowing there are some out near Melbourne and it gives me results way out in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. When I change the search term to “bioluminescent Kayak tours near me“ I got zero results. | We just returned home for a two week trip in central America. We use Hector as a day car tour guide  when we visited San Salvador city

 he was prompt, and on time, picked us up at the hotel, clean vehicle was very passionate about the city and sharing all his inside knowledge as a local that actually lives on site, can’t say enough good things about Hector and his service 

The only downside it goes through violator and a third-party, which kind of garbles the communication on the front end, but we were able to crack the code and get the vouchers and everything sorted out the day of the actual tour | What a great site! I travel all around the world and this is so simple and organized!  The “booking.com” for activities!! | Thank you 🐴🤍♠️ | I recently booked the Albir, Altea, Benidorm & Calpe: Guadalest & Algar Excursion through Viator, and I must say, it was a huge letdown. The troubles started with the lack of accurate information provided by Viator regarding the meet-up point. Despite my efforts to clarify the meet-up location by calling, emailing, and texting a day before the tour, I received no response whatsoever.

On the day of the tour, the meet-up point had apparently been removed without any notice. Not even the digital ticket contained updated information. This lack of communication and support from Viator left me stranded and frustrated.

To exacerbate matters, when attempting to contact the tour company, they rudely informed me that it wasn't business hours, despite it being the day of the tour. When they finally did answer, they were unhelpful and dismissive, insisting that the information was in an email. However, I had proof through emails that the information they claimed to have sent was not provided.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply dissatisfied. Both Viator and the tour company displayed a lack of responsibility and poor customer service, making for a thoroughly disappointing and frustrating experience. | I love booking excursions with Viator. App is easy to navigate through and I find some great excursion in all places I have been to within and outside the United States. We used Viator for New Orleans, New York, Alaska ,  Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Dubai, Cartagena Columbia, Nashville and have never been disappointed! | I tried to contact customer support and our tour guide for 1.5 hours. The tour guide never showed and we received no information from customer support on the app or via email. | When I am promoted to login, viator does not return to the item I was in the middle of booking. | We loved the tours in Mexico City, but the app wasn’t as great. It pushed us to email and web browsers for tickets. | Booked tickets to Catacombs in Paris and Absolutely ridiculous how many hoops I had to jump through on this site that made me download app to prompt me get my tickets- then as soon as I downloaded, logged in with at least 2 email confirmations & a puzzle to solve, my tickets was a voucher to present at the site. Waste of 20 min of my time and highly annoying you have to do anything now days with an app. I’m using this once & deleting it. | Planning our excursions while in Greece was very easy and the customer service was amazing. | The app no longer takes passwords, requires email link which doesn’t work. Works fine in safari but forget using the app if you need to login. | Signed up for a number of experiences using the Viator website. So far so good. But when going to retrieve the tickets got caught in a maddening do-loop of “you must open the app to retrieve your tickets “ but app refuses to log me in once the emailed confirmation is complete. Finally found a way to download a pdf to myself after about an hour of frustration | Booked an overnight transfer from our hotel to the airport for a 7am flight. This was done the day before.
We didn’t have the option to select the pickup time which was worrying, and didn’t get a confirmation or anything. We realized that we needed to add a third person to our reservation so we called the transportation company(since viator doesn’t let you update anything)… and they tried to fix it. While on the phone, I asked them what the pickup time was since I still didn’t have an email and they said they would let me know within 30 minutes, since they hadn’t found a driver yet. The flight was 10 hours out, at this point…

An hour later, I got an email saying that the transport company was canceling the order because they couldn’t pick us up at 4am, and that we needed to book with “overnight transfer”, which was what we had selected to begin with. I believe that if we hadn’t called to add a person, we wouldn’t have heard anything until after the flight.

Viator now says they can’t refund our order because the time already passed. | The app is convenient but you’ll pay a 200% markup or more for tickets! | Fast and accurate. | Jalisa was our knowledgeable private tour guide at the Museums of American History and Natural History Museum.  She helped us enjoy and get up close to many interesting exhibits and brought them to life for us with her stories. We highly recommend this tour. | The authentication process is a loop of an email link to opening the app with tells you to log in which sends you an email which opens the app that tells you to log in. Over and over. | Easy to navigate. But should have deal button to browse quickly and add coupons for customers. | I rarely review apps but not sure how this one is at 5 stars. You can’t see vouchers in their app, there are tours where they won’t tell you the pick up point and sometimes for refunds they will ask you to talk to the tour operator.

Unreal. Better apps out there. Avoid. | I have booked several tours with this organization, and the tours are always great. In addition to great tours, their customer service and responsiveness is amazing. I will always use them. | I have used ViaTour in several different countries, including Australia/NZ, Europe and Asia, and have never been disappointed. On the few occasions I had had to cancel, the process was easy and full refund was received within two days. | Looks like it has some great activities but you can’t sign up as a single person, 2 is the lowest number of people in any of the tours I looked at. | My ticket ended being scheduled for a week after my planned one, not only the operator noticed when I asked for help neither they will refund you or allow you to use the $$ in a different tour. I didn’t even wanted the money but the tickets in a different day | The app itself is super handy, but it’s hobbled by its inability to add events to your calendar unless you let it have full calendar access. There is absolutely no reason this app needs to be able to READ every event on my calendar other than to collect and sell my private data. iOS allows you to set calendar permissions to “Add Events Only,” but the app won’t add events with that option selected. There’s no excuse for that. | In my opinion it is wrong for a company to block reviews they don't like under the excuse of ""community standards.""
I'm not alone. Read the most recent reviews. Lots of 1 stars. | Poor | Haven't gone wrong yet.  Great guides and always fun.  Have made new friends. | Book through any other travel site, and you will find a better price. Just test it for yourself and see that [Viator] has a huge markup. Further, when you send them quotes from other sites showing the better price, [Viator] will still refuse to match the price, even though it’s in their guarantee. | Having same issues as most recent review from Geoz777. Go into the app and it sends a link to email. Email link opens in browser and the app doesn’t recognize that the link has been opened, making it impossible to actually sign into my account on the app. 

Note to developers - maybe use a 4 digit code sent to the email that can be manually entered into the app for confirmation. The link thing clearly isn’t working as intended. | Got the app. It asks for my email. Then sends a link. I click on the email and it takes me to the browser version of the site. It recognizes me as a past customer. Then there is a link to the app.  Click on that link and it asks for my email. Start all over and can’t get out of the loop. Tried help but no links to customer service. 😵‍💫 | helped me book a fun affordable excursion for my trip ! | It will not work if you try to only allow access to add to calendar. It wants full access to your calendar. This is too invasive. Tours are easy to book and manage though, other than that | If your experience goes well then the app is great. I called support for help with a booking for them only to screw it up and cause additional problems. 

I was charged a different amount then the confirmation email and spoken with multiple people to try to resolve. I have received plenty of emails asking for reviews, which I have left. 
Activity: good
Viator support experience: terrible

I even asked for someone to contact me and have not been contacted. I spoke with someone today who was able to refund the difference of the cost to the correct amount on my confirmation email. 

If your still reading my advice: avoid 3rd party apps like this and book directly from the source | I used the website and app twice in Hawaii and in DC. The recommendations and descriptions have worked out each time. Enjoyed each tour and trip without a mishap. I always recommend it since. | We have always recommended and used Viator. | If you don’t know , this island can be expensive ,  but with this app I found all the amusement i was interested in for a very low exciting price so thank you so much for being so convenient towards my fun factor and my wallet. Also I  earned some dollar rewards towards my next purchases. That’s Awesome  , I’m enjoying this app and taking full advantage for my future adventures. 👍👍👍👍👍 | I booked a hot air balloon ride in Mexico City to see the pyramids in November. The tour company called me the night before to inform me I needed to reschedule. I could not as I was on travel and I requested a refund immediately. 

They didn’t answer for about a month so I disputed the claim on my card. Viator proceeded to fight (and won) my dispute and I’m now stuck with just under $500 in charges for services I didn’t receive. I’m never using this service again. | Major Bug

Cannot sign in on app.

*** also the download pdf doesn’t download anything

*** trying to add a password to account freezes the browser window. | Unable to move tickets from my email into this app to save my life, have sent email links into and out of 3 different mobile browsers, only to end up back at the same “check email” screen.

Making it extremely difficult to prepare effectively for my upcoming trip | I wanted to book a tour, but they require a date of birth.  How absurd.  Why would they need that.  They lost business of that.",4.91174,88852,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/7a/c4/fe/7ac4fe16-c461-5782-1032-c7baff643190/d6c266e0-b368-415d-81ee-38b9d875bcd7_EN_Screenshot_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/1f/0f/fc/1f0ffc0a-e5c7-f7f4-a522-c9a1a7795bc7/e0f4aea0-a773-436b-8fbb-29c7b7078a83_iPhone_5.5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/0e/8f/96/0e8f9649-f24e-4db0-71d4-3a8b8b4b41d3/b30a5200-bad5-42c5-a740-9831f1f20c6a_EN_Screenshot_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/46/fe/be/46febec3-b159-730a-dae2-169c68444cd9/09eeac90-e9f9-4779-ab3f-ce4f9a8d3ca1_EN_Screenshot_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/b1/85/69/b1856982-3ccf-324b-f228-8acec70ba227/6dd08a04-c000-4ce4-88f1-4415889ffaa8_EN_Screenshot_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/9f/99/e4/9f99e45a-287d-1ede-0782-e865f490eddd/9f804244-a25e-4c36-8878-532d40d10dde_EN_Screenshot_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/c2/0d/4a/c20d4a77-2b19-f6fe-809f-99830b348c60/6154232d-18a5-4a08-b77b-e87aa7d1a948_EN_Screenshot_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/f2/f0/42/f2f0428e-44b3-71be-5b70-c0a80c27c4c2/b0a44792-1abc-4e93-bee4-8ee78e8dbe3d_iPad_Screenshot_1_English.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/af/94/4d/af944d15-7dc3-2c73-2649-7ebfb0c5d6b0/ea05421c-040d-49f8-a984-5e1b10fd95ca_iPad_English_7.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/62/92/fc/6292fcca-2f3c-c342-46e6-592ab16bbbfe/008d0efa-7cd2-4af8-9a0c-d70b4ffa9152_iPad_Screenshot_3_English.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/6f/7b/05/6f7b0508-f9e0-7fde-4c7b-ddac32306252/6f42f0e1-30c7-4b69-b99e-2f71e649ea48_iPad_Screenshot_4_English.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/fe/4a/44/fe4a44bf-42be-30ea-62f1-c534523b4de0/960024d2-1e36-4acd-ba22-87d3b35021fe_iPad_Screenshot_5_English.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/fd/47/5f/fd475fb5-6b0e-21cb-a922-8d8bb7d9a253/a4cd15f2-b6bf-4c5b-a3c4-6bf3674d3b17_iPad_Screenshot_6_English.jpg/552x414bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/91/d6/56/91d6566a-b39b-4be7-9d5b-10cd7b3dbbea/27713907-7313-4679-8667-dfcf3b1fd864_iPad_Screenshot_2_English.jpg/552x414bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPh

They used AI to help me journal my past trips too and never thought it can be such an easy and fun way to journal my trips. I have been using Nowy to plan my trips and now I can journal past trips as well. It makes me wanna travel more! | Finally found a travel app that I can search any cities and even small destinations in Brazil and Mexico. It’s amazing, easy to use, great idea and cute pages. The best thing I like is the AI can keep recọmmending different hidden gems besides what you already had in the existing itinerary. Simply amazing! | It is really great and does everything I need. It’s perfect for organizing trip details and plan everything together.  I personally love it and worths 5 stars | I loves traveling and exploring new places but always struggles with planning. I can’t believe how this app is so easy to get a planning for you. Definitely recọmmend this app to anyone who wants to simply your travel. | I am so happy to have found Nowy! I used to spend so much time with vacation planning, but Nowy does it all for me in just a few minutes. Plus, I can book flights, hotels, and activities all in this app! No need for 10 different apps or websites anymore. Highly recommend Nowy!!! | I was booking a last minute trip to Amsterdam and decided to try Nowy to help me plan. Let’s just say, I am so impressed! It helped us find a last minute hotel one stop from the main station for a really good price. It also gave us suggestions of where to eat, what museums to attend and planned out the days with efficient travel routes. Some of the highlights of my trip that Nowy’s AI assistant suggested were: the Heineken Experience, the body museum, and a nighttime canal cruise to Amsterdam during the winter light festival (which was our favorite). It also gave us some great suggestions of local places where the locals eat. I can’t wait for my next trip! | I used to use Google Drive and sheet to plan out my trips. I NO longer need to do so.
This is app has made our trip planning so easy especially while planning a 10 day road trip from Las Vegas to Arizona and Utah! The itinerary has all the website, photos and addresses everything. Surprisingly we can see our live location inside the our trip and know the distance to the next stop!

After we finished the trip and organized the final itinerary, I found the itinerary can be shared completely to our friends and see the full itinerary by the share link! This is amazing and I don’t need to send Doc any more. What a life saver!

So good and helpful! | I was trying to plan a 3-day trip to Tokyo, and the AI generated a decent itinerary based on my preference. I shared the itinerary with my friend, and it got us started on planning out the Tokyo trip!! Highly recommend it to anyone looking to save time when planning trips. I hope the app will automatically find me the best deals based on my finalized itinerary. | I’ve been searching for an app that’s user friendly and aesthetic to journal my trips and after using Nowy for a while I know this is it! The app is easy to navigate through and has many great options to customize your trips the way you want. On top of that, I can search what fun locations are near me to explore. As a lazy but eager traveler, this feature has pushed me to go outside more. There’re new features coming out continuously to create better user interfaces. I absolutely love it! | This is an awesome app, great idea, very useful for travel and provide a lots of information.

An essential tool for global expats, digital nomads, permanent residents, dual residents, overseas homeowners, and frequent travellers.

AUTO TRIP RECORDING
With geolocation tracking, Flamingo automatically determines if you have left your residence country or state and accurately records your trip details so that you don’t have to. Keep tabs on the countries and states you’ve visited and how many days you spent there.

SCHENGEN AREA CALCULATOR
If you frequently travel to the EU Schengen Travel Area as a non-resident, it can be a hassle to keep up with the 90 in 180 days rule. Flamingo counts how many combined days you’ve already spent in Schengen countries and how many more you have left in the 180-day period. If you’re already located in the EU as a non-resident, Flamingo tells you the date when you have to leave to avoid overstaying.
The built-in calculator helps you determine not only the earliest date you can travel to the EU for your desired number of days, but also for how many days you can stay if you arrive on your desired date.

VISA-FREE STAY
Based on your citizenship, Flamingo automatically identifies to which countries you need a visa, e-visa, or visa on arrival and where you can travel absolutely visa-free.
Coming soon: Flamingo will also tell you how long you can stay in each country visa-free, monitor your duration of stay and alert you when you’ll be close to overstaying.

RESIDENCE STATUS FOR COUNTRIES & US STATES
Flamingo helps you determine your physical presence for domicile and residency by automatically recording and counting how many days you spend there.
*Especially useful for Statutory Residence Test for UK expats and Substantial and Physical Presence Tests for US expats and permanent residents.

EXPORT REPORTS
You can download a customizable CSV report with your travel details with the tap of a button. Share it with authorities and lawyers in seconds or keep it for your own travel records. 

COMPLETE PRIVACY
Your travel, residency, and visa data is stored locally only on your device. We do not collect, nor store, your information on our servers. 
*With Flamingo PRO you can sync your data via iCloud across all your devices.

Would now need to go back and update the timeline manually. 

The core value proposition of the app doesn’t work. | We investigated numerous apps for tracking travel and residency, and one app clearly stood out. We have a complex situation involving time spent in numerous countries and several US states. This app's intuitive design simplifies what could be a complex and distracting tracking process—it has been a big stress reducer, to say the least. But what truly impressed us was the level of customer support. I had a few unique scenarios I wanted to clarify, and after reaching out, I received prompt, detailed, and supportive responses. It is unusual to find a blend of well-designed software and exceptional support. I confidently recommend this app to anyone in need of managing their travel and residency details. It's an excellent tool, supported by a dedicated, thoughtful, and caring team. | I got this app to track my location for tax purposes. We have homes in both Florida and Minnesota. We just became FL residents. I wanted to be able to easily prove I was out of MN 183 days. I just checked the app and after only 33 days it is totally wrong. I was in FL 29 days and in MN for 4. It says I was 7 nights in and 26 nights out of my state of residency. I’m so disappointed as I trusted this app would do what it’s supposed to do. Now I don’t have the easy, accurate records to prove my residency for 2024. It’s too late to start another residency tracking app for this year. What a waste of money. So glad I only paid for a month and not a whole year. | Finally what I was looking for! Due to my work, I go from state to state throughout the year and come tax season it’s hard for me to figure out in what state I should file my taxes. With this app, the headache is gone as it counts my days automatically. I can also easily put in my previous trips to count the times I traveled before I installed the app. I also like the design and how intuitive it is.",4.68,75,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2b/13/df/2b13df17-4004-d526-45ae-ef0abb330753/1d469fef-4019-402a-81f3-94eb0663f7d8_w_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ba/f1/f9/baf1f9e6-a03c-30ad-0253-43dea720aa3c/e447ab5d-85f6-461a-b93b-249e9699b8e3_w_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6f/87/4a/6f874aba-0edf-3598-95d8-8369f9c4c181/787418a7-c67e-4a02-86ff-bba0d28cc987_w_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/72/48/2e/72482e51-2dc1-3c5a-e686-f4a0079e3094/8d66813e-a216-49b4-b197-3e1b847e7866_w_4jpg.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f0/e6/44/f0e6444f-7816-261c-6f76-2e0d77a2caac/678a3389-e43d-4d70-a9b3-69c5c6406927_w_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a8/58/e4/a858e4d8-d590-7bbc-536a-1404492e8e49/43949152-4ac9-4c0d-9b5b-f919420063f7_w_7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/af/2a/5faf2ade-fdab-bd39-30cc-37a64c34f328/f00ad6bf-f850-4d7a-8a36-ad743ce24d41_w_8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3c/20/9e/3c209ec6-bc6e-85f9-9761-c93d4650f42e/1f4e344f-4ffe-448a-a1ac-6d4089d5b1ff_w_9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5a/01/6a/5a016a6f-1c92-637b-b18a-9b6475d7af16/25b8fba8-9e4e-4e9e-b140-9c76bff55235_w_10.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Unfortunately it would never connect and kept giving me the connecting circle of death that didn’t go anywhere. I contacted tech support and am still awaiting a response 4 weeks now and counting. | I packed everything more quickly than usual and I didn’t forget anything. Will keep using it | I travel a few times per year so I am not a huge traveler. But I did not find this app user friendly. Maybe it just didn’t suit my needs but I’m not impressed. | It has lists that auto populate based on the length of your stay, weather, etc but I really want to just attach my own things in addition, reservations, activities, restaurants. Maybe I just don’t understand this app. And it has nothing to explain it | Not $3, but $3 a month. Super annoying setup where you can just start making a list, you have to put in dates, destinations, and type of trip. I’m looking for a packing list app that lets me input my own lists. Keep it simple. | I’ve been using this app for many years and I’ve been very happy. I only use it once or twice a year and it was free before. I don’t mind paying to keep the app but now it’s wanting me to pay $20 a year. I would be happy to pay $20 just to have the app forever but there’s no way I’m going to pay that every year.I’m very disappointed because I really liked this app | This app told me to bring a scarf to Disneyland this weekend. It’s not going to be cold enough. You need to change your app and only tell people to bring a scarf when it’s below freezing. | Very basic packing list. It is good to include power adapters, health insurance card, but neglects things like an umbrella, hat and jacket and small scissors. Also …for a long trip it suggested 15 shirts …which is ridiculous. I take no more than 5 shirts even if going for months. Clothes can be washed. 
I don’t see any reason to pay for this app. It’s ok I suppose if you don’t already have a packing list of your own. There are many better packing lists for free on websites. | The way the ads appear and they way the interact (close ads overlap, etc), the app is unusable. | Used to be great. Now it’s just ads. How can an app about packing have so many ads? It’s insane. They also deleted all my old packing lists, so I can’t even reference those. Time to find another app. | I downloaded it and immediately opening the app my phone was overloaded with ads inside the app. Absolutely do not like this app at all | I recommend this app to everyone. I particularly hate packing because it’s so stressful, but the customized activity lists make packing a breeze. | Don’t like being forced to watch an ad to use the app | If dobt get premium sibscriptions doesnt seem like you can do much | Update: After using this for a weekend trip, this may not be the app for me. It is extremely frustrating that every time I open the app, it prompts me for an update. However, the App Store does not have an update.

But then all my lists keep getting put out of alphabetical order. This is annoying to find to check out and try to pack. Then items will be added to a person when creating a trip and it is not on the list that I have so where did it come from?

I will be looking for about her app.

———————————————

I am searching for a good packing list. While this one is okay, it is frustrating. I have spent all day trying to load it up with our trips and it is just not user friendly. It is constantly putting my lists out of alphabetical order. So for me to sort it manually within each list and trip is just annoying. I also wish that I could easily remove a person from a trip and changing from multi-trip to single when duplicating a trip. | Updating my review because now there’s offline mode. Great app! | This app makes it so easy to put together a list for packing. As someone who struggles to stay organized, this app helps so much with providing suggested items per planned activity. SO much better than trying to make sure I think of everything on my own. I undoubtedly will either forget something or overpack planning it on my own. | This app is extremely helpful. It customizes your packing lists for the weather at your destination (and can update this). It also customizes it for your planned activities and duration of stay. It is a great way to make sure that you have what you need and don’t forget anything. it is by far the best list of this sort that I have encountered. The only small improvement I might suggest is for long trips on which you will be washing every few days, it would be helpful if you could specify the number of days between each washing so that the app knew what to recommend for packing. Nevertheless, it does a great job. | I’ve never used another tool, but this one has everything I need — pre-built lists, weather forecast and the ability to customize. Love it! | I have used Packr on iPhone and iPad for years. I did not realize there was a Mac app until recently so I downloaded it.

I have tried different packing list apps and packing list methods over the years including a spreadsheet, Notes, a Word document, and other packing list apps. I even tried Macsparky's Reminders packing list idea. I always come back to Packr. Why have I tried other apps if I like Packr? Because I like to try new apps! But I will not stray again. Packr just works for me. I ike that I can make different lists for different needs for different trips and reuse them over and over. 

Thank you for a great app! | I created my trip, selected the categories and when I submitted to continue, it gave me the option to either pay $3/mo or $20/yr for premium or watch an ad. I opted for the ad, because I hadn’t gotten far enough into the app to know if I like it. The full screen, 10-second ad counted down but then it was done, the ad wouldn’t close! The little “x” was there in the top right corner but it didn’t work. I closed and relaunched the app twice, re-created the trip (because it wasn’t saved), and the same thing happened. I could have written out my entire packing list on paper in the time I wasted trying to make this app work. So disappointed. | This app is great, and it just keeps getting better. It works wonderful for multi city vacations or just quick getaways. One of my favorite features is saving customizable list. This allows me to have specialists for each of my trip needs, from camping in the mountains to water sports at the lake. Plus I can add my personalized photo to the top of the trip. | Used to be able to create a new default list with icons to choose.  Not saving new lists or adding an icon.  I thought you could add more than one trip photo. Can't find information on a huge venue tourist site in a city. | I like the concept of Packr but one major flaw. I want it to automatically sync between my iPad and my iPhone. All my other apps automatically sync (icloud) but it appears this has to be manually synced every time you make a change. Very inefficient. | I wanted to try out the app to see how it worked. No matter what activity I chose it pushed the buy-pro. I deleted the app. If you can’t give it a test run to see how you like it, I’ll try another app | My devices have separate apps and don’t load the same trips. It would be nice if they would sync and have the same trips. Is there a profile? Not even seeing a way to log in. | Been a premium user for a while. Really wanted to love it because I travel for work a ton and need customized packing lists. This app has so many bugs and I am tired of items not showing up in lists I create, or reverting back to old lists after being updated. The idea is great but the execution is just not there. | Use basically every trip | Very basic app for the price | After creating your trip, you’re met with a full screen advertisement that can’t be closed even after the allotted time. The X button is unresponsive. | I purchased Packr Premium several years ago and absolutely love it. I had a problem when I deleted this app off of my iPad and thought I had lost all my lists, but the developer fixed it within a day. I use this app for all of my trips because I love the weather forecasts which help me know how to pack. I also have saved customized packing list for different activities like backpacking or international travel. I have recommended this app to several travel buddies who were green with envy when they saw all it could do. If you travel, it’s worth every penny. | I was packing for Coachella and this made my life so much easier because I was dealing with a health problem that made me very uncomfortable and not feel like myself. A month or so in advance, I was brainstorming things I wanted to pack and had come up with a preliminary list. Then as I was packing for the few days before leaving for the trip, I was adding as I went. Finally I finished everything on my list and I didn’t know what else to bring. I had to sleep and then leave in 6 hours lol. It was great!! I didn’t forget anything. 

I really like the layout of this app. Sometimes it can get confusing with lists and removing stuff in lists it asks you if you want it removed forever, i just ignore them and it seems to work out fine since i dont really need to pack for trips that frequently. It works well for when you want an app that’s not your Notes or Reminders app | This app is my CONSTANT GO TO to help me with my business and pleasure travels!
THANK YOU for being such an AWESOME APP!!!!!!!! | I’ve several other packing list apps and have settled on Packr. It just does packing lists and does it really well. I highly recommend it. Also their tech support is awesome. | Can’t get passed the first add. The X is so far off the edge you can’t close the add. 
USELESS GARBAGE. | You can’t get to the packing list.  Watch an ad that allows you to advance but the button to advance to the list page doesn’t work.  Honestly, it’s an app that tells you how many pairs of socks you should bring on a 3 day trip, why the ads?  Delete immediately. | it crashes on my macbook. too bad. I had used in the past | I am a very heavy packer. Though I’m still this way, this app has helped me improve greatly. It’s very cool how it tells you the number of things to bring like socks, and shirts, gives you the ability to add things and tailors needs to the weather forecast…which it also has. It’s been 5-Starts since I bought it and has continued to be with updated and new features added | Do not download. Interface commonly crashes and though it is ad centric, the ads are coded in such a way as not to allow access through once viewed. Lists aren’t generated. | Do not have what I need | It might just be me. I love the app, but I’m not sure how I see the other family members I added. How do I see the list for my son? | This app thinks of everything. You tell it where you’re going and for how long and it gives you the most thoughtful packing list ever. It thinks of every single thing you may need for your trip! I highly recommend it!! | The new version makes you pay to even make a list anymore. The old didn’t. BAD. Try Packing List: Trip Planner instead. | Greatest app of all humanity for packing! | I can’t print my list.  The option is there, but it closes the app and doesn’t bring up a list. This doesn’t help me. If you want to carry your phone while you pack, this may be fine. | App crashed and I lost my $4.99 for the upgrade to premium. | I use this app for every trip I take!   Perfectly organized and easy to use!   The only reason I gave four stars is because the local  attractions are not so local!   A trip to the Bahamas brings me activities to do near Greece! | Premium in app purchase doesn’t share with family, I bought it and thought my wife could share it with 1 purchase. Not fair and the sharing feature isn’t explained well. | I love this app for packing lists. I have used TripIt for a couple years for keeping track of travel info. This works well with that to help me prep and pack for those trips. I’m he suggested lists consider weather and what I will be doing (after I make selections) to make the list very practical. I can also add my own notes and modify the list as I see fit. I also love the ability to share a list. I’m his has been helpful for my husband and me as we can just check that app and make updates (instead of assuming the other grabbed it or grabbing double.) 

The only addition that would have been helpful for this trip is a section for pets. I could be similar to the section for babies, but including things like food, leash, crate, meds, etc. would be super helpful for those of us who have pets but don’t always travel with them. | I want the travel butler back!!!",4.61564,6010,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/5a/47/d3/5a47d3a3-b129-2949-ae98-0b5808b830e2/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/20/db/a2/20dba266-ba4a-1495-34ca-5835c161ac1f/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/1b/7c/78/1b7c78ab-a107-f5db-48ba-6f3b3ac46300/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/d6/02/46/d6024607-cb09-95bb-d0fa-4a215477bfbb/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/46/92/f3/4692f3bb-a142-449b-23b6-df29022df792/pr_source.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/ab/64/4d/ab644d37-a1bb-93d6-b0d9-5256dc2fa9c2/f7009e51-8ea4-4437-848d-d61fa2542f93_EN_ipadPro129_1_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/71/4c/88/714c88ca-3f83-6194-0c3d-273436619c62/8cc8d6b5-ef74-48ef-95dc-c17f85df32b5_EN_ipadPro129_2_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/f5/ae/dd/f5aedd11-fe30-441c-79e9-7eb6395df7e9/8eba6cb9-4852-48ec-86f0-24b542ebb11d_EN_ipadPro129_3_framed.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Has a lot of potential, but definitely needs work! Hope it improves quickly! | I love and miss the layout and design of pluto i was obsessed! But pogo is good as well! I love the detail and i love planning trips with this app! | The idea is there and I love the search and find option but the app is slow and anytime I click to view a category the app freezes or restarts. You’d think that exiting the app would fix that problem, but it’s just rinse and repeat and still freezes when trying to view the categories. Which really makes it more hassle than what it’s worth. | THE REBRAND IS SO BAD, I’m devastated. Pluto was one of my favorite apps and I can’t stand using the new version. The old branding was unique, beautiful and had character, not to mention the usability and functionality was also amazing. Was this rebrand tested with literally any users?? It could not have gotten positive responses. | Sorry, but the new branding is horrendous. I LOVED the old Pluto, and had it proudly on my home screen. The new logo, name, everything is so awful I’m tempted to delete the app altogether. I know rebranding takes time, effort, and money, but this was not the way to go, in my honest opinion. It feels like a cheap imitation of a popular social app, instead of embracing the unique beauty that was the old app. | I am not sure how this app received so many great reviews. It was very difficult to navigate. the flow didn’t make sense. I just was not impressed overall. | Tbh I never write reviews especially for an APP 💀BUT I’m planning a road trip soon and super exited so I wanted something to help keep me organized ✨it’s actually pretty good and cute and neat it’s like Pinterest in a way . I’m not a bot either :) thanks Pluto ! | The aesthetic of this app is incredible. 

One HUGE thing I wish it had is an actual
itinerary in date/time order. You can save everything in this app but it won’t show you a timeline like other travel apps do. 
Add that and a widget for your home screen, and I wouldn’t need any other app for travel. 

Unfortunately right now it doesn’t work 100% alone for me, I still use TripIt for the itinerary timeline feature. | I was looking for an app that would allow me to collaborate trip ideas with my friends. With very few reviews, I was uncertain, but decided to give Pluto a try and I’m so glad I did! 
So far the user experience is top notch. The app is running very smoothly, no lags or glitches. It’s very intuitive and user-friendly, and in minutes I was easily able to navigate myself around, start a trip and invite my friend to collaborate. 
A few suggestions:
When initially walking through the first steps, I would like to be able to pick a region to travel, not just a specific state or city. For instance, I wanted to be able to say Pacific Northwest, but that wasn’t an option. Also, I would like to be able to create my own categories within the trip. 

Solid five stars for usability and of course that it’s free. | i’ve been on the hunt for a travel/itinerary app that was easy on the eyes and incredibly user friendly! | I normally look at Pinterest or YouTube to look up things to do. I love that they already have popular things to try. | Awesome app for planning our holiday! there were lots of things I look for - but until now, I haven’t seen them all in one place. 
The app is very easy to use. You can also save ideas and places to eat. 
And also it served you up inspiration from the app’s recommendations. Top marks! | This app is off to a great start, they definitely have more to add, but I’m enjoying the flexibility and functionality they have now.

I have found that those that don’t have as much flexibility. Don’t get the best deals. I on the other hand can fly pretty much anywhere in the US for so much cheaper using the app and it’s algorithms! I am currently looking for flights out of the country and excited to see what Hopper can provide! Additionally, I have a child out of state for college and she has flown home for $38 round-trip. There is nothing better if you are willing to take the time to be flexible.

Melissa 51 Minnesota | I love playing this game Domino. It’s a good game to play. I play all the time now that I have downloaded. I just love it. | Hopper relieves me of much of the anxiety that I associate with booking trips. | Fast and simple | so good, enjoying iy., | I have found Hopper very helpful when looking for flights or hotel rooms. They lock in a good price for a hotel and a flight. | For someone who doesn’t know a lot about buying plane tickets, this app has taken a lot of pressure off of it. And shows important details, like free bag check 😅 | I have used hopper many of times . Definitely a great service . | Great | They are good they help you with anything you may need and get you the best prices available. | It keeps sending me prices. I love it for dreaming and planning. | Great app. Great prices. ✨ | They reimbursed me my money when my hotel got canceled and got me into another room asap ,they got great flight options and if it all goes well I’ll be booking my flight from Ohio to Puerto Rico this July 👏🏽great app highly recommend | I always buy my tickets on this app I never have any trouble and I find the better prices here. 
This review is totally honest, I’m recommend hopper! | Always there when I need a quick flight ✈️✈️✈️ | To use | I have an account and cannot log into the website I have called numerous times to technical support. I am trying yo delete my account but cannot get into my account to do so. I have never written a review before but fed up going through the same process. | I had the worst experience and lost over $500. I cancelled my flight within 24 hours and they didn’t process it and suddenly it was not refundable because of the airline policy. The insurance that I also purchased through them surprise surprise doesn’t cover it either. 

They take zero responsibility and are extremely rude. I was on the phone for an hour trying to get help. Only for their supervisor to be twice as rude as Dev. 

Funnily enough I had about three trip that I was going to book through them later in the year, but now forget that. Save your money spend it with another company with better morals/customer service. | Never encountered a problem, very user friendly app and some great prices :)) | Great app for affordable prices | Have been booking my flights through Hopper since 2018. It’s now my “go to”, whenever I need to travel. I highly recommend it. | All on one page | Fantastic | So I turned on the alerts months ago to notify me of the best deals to book my flights to Mexico. Every time I checked in it would tell me to hold off and wait for a better deal. Now I’m a month out from booking my trip and flights are the most expensive they’ve been! Not once did it recommended I purchase my tickets (which by the way the best deal was a few months ago). 

The whole point of this app is to help save money on flights and travel. If you can’t even do that right you’re failing at the your whole purpose. I’m deleting this app after I post this.

Just stick to google flight. | 💪💪💪💪 | I am a new Hopper user. The app is easy to use and provides great insight into various date and flight options that are useful. | I find good prices for flights. | Doing great on this thing can always find what I’m looking for. | Convenient, quick flight check | I Love this app! | The app is so easy to use and they always find me the best deals! | Love the discounted prices! | I am not one to leave reviews but this app literally took my money ! I booked a 2 night motel at pismo for my birthday with hopper April 3rd They charged my debit card for $261 that day and the representative I spoke on the phone who was helping me book let me know I was good to go and I wouldn’t have to pay when I checked into my motel!! Well the day had come to check in at my motel April 19th and the guy working there told me my room was only reserved!! And not paid for!! So if my room was only reserved then what did I pay for hopper?? I was not going to sleep in my car so I had to pay another $192 for my 2 night stay at pismo I tried calling hopper support and told me they’d work on the issue and receive an email in 48 hrs confirming a refund and I still have not received anything. Why was I charged the $261 if my room was not booked ! Where did my money go too? It’s absurd that I had to pay again at check in. I really wanted to like this app but unless this issue isn’t resolved I will keep calling and warning everyone about this app until I get my money back. Confirmation number: 5MPXGV2B82B5 | Save tons of time and money | Easy to use and always has the best deals | I’m a hard worker who always pays attention to every penny, I always check hopper to see if I should go on vacation or not lol. I have yet to go on vacation, but this is the app I always refer to. | Let’s see what the peeps are talking about | It’s find the cheapest price and allow you to choose your favorite | Good to use and easy to search in varies ways | I use Hopper for ALL my travel bookings.I get a cheap flight ALL the time. | Title | I’m excited to see how cheap prices can get | Good price in offers | They let kid who under age of 18 to book the hotel.and  the kid is hiding and use fake adult  info to book the hotel. Then the agent manager said they don’t refund, other another hand, they allow people who is under age of 18 can check in hotel in the United States!  ALSO no one is answering my questions, and they are kick the balls between HOOPER and hotel. ‘Manager’ don’t understand their policy well, not professional at all! We even read the policy to him and he still don’t understand, how could let a person don’t understand how to process the customer’s needs. Cutting from my conversation, so rude and trying to cut my call ! | Hop on the hopper for travel deals AllllllllllllYeahhhhhhhhh | I’ve actually been using this app for years I don’t always purchase flights from the app itself but tracking the prices and getting notified when they change is really handy and I love the calendar that shows you what days are cheaper to fly. | Thank you for making travel a bit easier",4.81393,1108952,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f8/1b/25/f81b2545-7fdc-c0f8-a787-d0068faf4bb0/bb211926-3663-4586-8b06-7dfc8e63a904_01-Intro_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d6/e6/d0/d6e6d0f5-8e14-0526-e360-51b921f0cb16/63090fac-f322-4d41-afe9-cc08a9846f7f_02-Description_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/86/c9/2c/86c92c6b-5233-4a9b-6d1f-668f7b107fe6/88db50a1-be98-4525-9129-25181b0fd189_03-How_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ee/49/78/ee49788f-d638-4c19-3d4c-c6b7fa988431/fab8dc5e-04d4-4348-869f-7332b6443897_04-Dates_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/bf/09/7d/bf097d26-5b10-f1f6-fbec-48fe39070763/e060f38c-1bed-4a74-8438-296542c5ddbd_05-Predictions_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5c/08/1c/5c081cff-2abc-a008-7f43-fe9f5e8a41ab/7f8d647f-61c3-4a7e-95d5-ba0f4d90f4ff_06-Notifications_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/d6/d5/58/d6d558b4-4c3c-90d5-5b4e-f27bd5b0ec96/0475de58-08ba-439a-8f04-cda751e8e22d_07-Freeze_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a4/b8/6b/a4b86b5b-3886-0f57-aafb-bc7b365366ab/57397ac3-7a12-4de1-a903-abd17c27d22a_08-Flexible_1242x2208.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Ya cuando se acercaba la hora del despegue fui a preguntar y la respuesta fue cancelado y que regresara al siguiente día cuando ya había pagado hotel y alquilado un carro al cual solo estaba esperando mi llegada  a Orlando para disfrutara de los servicios que ya había pagado y llamó a las aerolínea y ninguna persona a respondido | I’m very disappointed to see that not all airlines are listed airline for destinations, and routes. For example a recent US itinerary that I put in, only offered one airline. I know that at least two other airlines offer routes for what I put in because I checked them directly with those airlines. It’s not much help if you don’t list all options available. | For some reason they took off some airplanes from the search. For example the United is out from many search that I now they have flights, so I need to use United APP to check the prices. | This is my all time favorite flight finder app. I rely on it and I swear by it.  I’ve been using this app for a very long time, maybe 8 years or more.  It is easy to use, to create alerts and save trips. You can get as many or as little updates as you want.  People are always amazed when I tell them what I paid to fly. I also love the option of fly anywhere so I can just pick a place to go based on the price. | I'm sorry but The text is too small for my eyes. I coud not find a setting to increase the font not dies the app utilize the accesibilty setting for font size in the operating system.  In this case, an iphone. As a result I have to pass on using Sky Scanner. | Prices 👍🏻 | I find the app most accurate airfare comparison and it shows most of available airlines options | Flight, hotel, car. Dare you to compare with google travel ! | I have tried them all and have settled on Skyscanner as my app of choice. I ALWAYS find the best prices and the best routes . | App redirects to shoddy airfare sellers instead of actual airlines.  This is disappointing as the Star Alliance website uses Skyscanner’s interface for actual airline prices in the alliance.  Best to book via airlines directly and check via other means than using this app. | Setting price alerts is one of the main features on this app but when I set a price alert in the mobile app they do not appear in the “my trips” section to be able to go back and view them. Defeats the whole point of the app as it was one of the main reasons I used it. Still works for the most part to find cheapest flights but no good for monitoring the price fluctuations.

Update: There is no option for “help support” in the app. There is a “support” button and within that a “find help” button that takes me to a webpage where I can search the apps website for answers to FAQs | One stop shopping for travel needs! Great price alerts for more savings! | I can’t see the calendar dates with cost of  fare one way. 
Please help | I love this app. It’s my goto whenever looking for flights. I always find the best rates on here. I’m always recommending it to my friends and family. I book all my moms travel on here. I like that it redirects you to the airlines website. | By mistake, I put wrong email, and I don't have any record for the reservation. | I would like this app to give me the option to filter-out flights on certain airplanes. I do not have confidence in Boeing, so it is important to me to be able to easily filter-out Boeing flights. | Love Skyscanner. But filtering out planes is crucial nowadays. Will change to 5 stars once aircraft model filters are implemented. Reason: I truly do NOT want to fly in 737 MAX planes, and I can’t easily filter them out. | Super app to see all travel options and prices! | Why can't I book tickets on this software? Showing my identity doesn't buy it. Only students can buy it. Why is it so difficult that this software is only sold to students? | All of the marketing emails come to me in Pounds Sterling. I can’t fix it in the app. I’ve tried. Hence, my confidence in this app is low. | Extremely efficient app. | Hate the recent update that removed domestic US flights. Skyscanner was my used travel app and this almost completely ruins the point for me. It was already lacking in filters and the latest update  just made it even worse and ruined the user experience for me | I like it when it shows the price of each day of the months | only reason i used the app | You used to be able to click the explore everywhere tab & it would show you the cheapest flights from your nearest airport. Now it just shows you countries, 0 flights in America. The entire reason I used this app is now gone | Automatic 1 star and deletion of the app | Great deals on airfare directly to the airlines | Why the mention price has been Chang after submitting | Skyscanner is the best app for my travels. They seem to give you honest prices instead of inflated numbers to get extra money from you. I highly recommend. | Not the first time | Links to fraudulent Indian websites | Easy way to compare prices | I don’t fly basic economy. I wish the app has an option to filter out basic economy fares. I have to leave the app to find the regular economy fare on the airline site. The app should let me remove basic economy fares from the results. | Love this app! | Helped me find flights in a crunch when other sites could not deliver | It would be a better app if the prices WERE ACTUALLY the real prices. Most of the time they give a low price but once you click on it, it doesn’t exist. For example: I saw a roundtrip for $81 from New York to Colombia I click it and the price doesn’t exist. It’s so annoying | من آفضل المواقع للحجوزات الطيران و الفنادق و ذلك عن تجربة | ونتما لكم المزيد من التقدم والازدهار | It would be even better if I could save certain settings for the initial search. Specifically, there are certain airlines that I refuse to fly. Of course, whenever I see a great deal, it is usually for one of those airlines (cough, spirit, cough). Any chance there could be an update to the app that would allow for that? A way to save favorite airlines? That way I don’t get my hopes up when I see a super cheap flight that will just add on the fees AND give terrible service. | Awesome | I have used Skyscanner when I start planning for a trip. Every time I have found Skyscanner very efficient, easy to use, and the price indicator extremely helpful. I will never undertake a trip without using Skyscanner.
Wilson | I went through the entire process of booking a great priced flight only to have it REJECTED!  Wouldn’t take my three digit CVV code!  Scammers.

I’m a computer software trainer, usually pretty good with these things, but this app constantly has me befuddled. I eventually figured it out, but then when I need to go back two months later, I’m again confused. | I think Puerto Rico is underwater. | We love to travel.  Middle class Texans, been to a lot nations, all 50 states and most of Texas’ farm to market and back paved/unpaved roads. Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao on our wish list then at 87 we’ll take a break. | The map is poor quality and hard to navigate but it gets the job. Zooming close enough to clearly see borders is frustrating on very small island countries. | If I purchase Visited Pro version, is it gonna be a monthly or yearly subscription? What additional features will be available? | STAY AWAY!! This app supports consumption of endangered species and exploitation of native cultures.  Travel apps are fun, and there are many many others that don’t do this. Choose a different one. | Can you please make the country flag size bigger. | I have never wrote a review EVER… but this may be the WORST app I have ever gotten in my life. Very frustrating to work. I LITERALLY had to type where I lived over 5 times. I could not get passed it no matter what. I just want a simple app that tracks the places I’ve been. Do NOT DOWNLOAD. | Nothing saves when I put it into the app. I emailed them months ago no response. Waste of money and I would like it back | Just keeps asking me what country I live in and what city. When hit next, it asks the same question. It’s an endless loop. | You have to pay the monthly subscription fee to even add the places you’ve been. | This app is great for travel and aspirational travel planning. Lots of cool features, I ended up paying for the full package. Tech support was fast and helpful when I had an issue. | Love this app! I just wish it had some better options and visuals for sharing maps and progress with friends and on social media. | The best thing about this App is that the owner actually responds to multiple request to add cities!  Easy and fun way to track my visits to 54 countries to date…. Including many non-tourist destinations. | It used to be you zoom in and see the subdivisions of the country. They got rid of that and now you have to click the country, then click a few other things. Nowhere near as seamless. Please bring the old functionality back! | The site keeps asking me to update where I live and won’t do anything else. | I have fun marking off places I have visited and being able to see my progress.  Also, the developers are great, as I have provided feedback and content and the team updates the app as needed.  Great job! | How is possible that you has to agree to receive thousands of emails that you don’t want to use the app? Plus has to pay extra for add remove but no email scam chain? Blame on you. | Sorry, if I can’t even try the app without signing up for an email list, it is a non-starter. I should not be required to sign up for marketing junk mail before I even know if I like the app. If this gets fixed/changed then maybe I could give a better rating. | I have been traveling a lot in recent years & decided I wanted to start logging locations. This was the 2nd app I decided to try, but I couldn’t even get past the set up because it required me to choose my home city off a list that didn’t contain my home city. It did not offer any way to manually enter my home city, and no way to bypass that selection. So, needless to say, I deleted the app. | Recommend multiple family profiles so kids are encouraged to discover as much/more as their parents | The app doesn’t load | This app looks so cool, but when I try to sign up, there is an error that pops up on the screen. I used different emails too. I don’t know what’s wrong!

EDIT: The app is super helpful. The customer support was amazing. Thank you! | Well I’d like to review this app for its features or literally anything but I can’t even use it. I try to make an account and it won’t get off the loading screen. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times. | Loved this app. But won’t load since the update yesterday! | I had been using this app and enjoyed it, but logged in today to a screen asking me to agree to a privacy policy. There was an additional checkbox asking permission for the app to send me promotional mail. I left it unchecked and submitted and was greeted with “Whoops! You must accept everything or delete your account. The two buttons to proceed were literally “ok” and “delete account”. I didn’t say ok. How insulting | Buggy. I downloaded this app and after 15 minutes of trying to see the scratched countries, I gave up. All I could see was a yellow dot where I live. I changed the water color and the whole map changed to that color except for the yellow dot. Waste of time. | Got this app to log the places I’ve traveled to and even bought the almost $10 packet which includes no ads, unlocks cities, regions etc., of where you’ve traveled. However, every time I wanted to save a city for example in Mexico, I wanted to log Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Tulum.. it would not save no matter how many times I pressed the BEEN button. Even restarted my phone to make sure the issue was not on my end.

Please fix this! | I liked the app but even after you pay to get rid of the ads they force you to subscribe to advertising email list.  It’s either subscribe or delete your account, the only options, I deleted my account t.  I got fooled. | Seriously? 8.99 for this? You can not even exporta decent picture of where you have been in the map. | Useless if you’ve only traveled domestically. | I’ve tried multiple times, and even deleted the app, reinstalled it, and still no luck. | Get ready to be spammed. They sell your email and all sorts of weird malicious spam starts reaching out to you | This is a good way to keep track of world travels. It works great. | Just trying to record countries visited not give you all my info. Ugh. | So it good with the countries. I was trying to update cities I been and lived and it would let me add. It only updates countries. It also isn’t user friendly. I have to re-teach myself how to reset the city I currently live (still not accurate on my app). Also, something I can get over if the city updates work, is it has plenty of Territories as separate counties which love, but it picks and chooses which ones (such as Canadian territories not being separated from the country) and it also doesn’t acknowledge all disputed territory very well. For example Morocco on it’s map has territory that isn’t part of it, it is UN accurate, but if your going UN accurate, then a territories shouldn’t be separate. So Puerto Rico is part of the United States and not independent. I do prefer that it separates it. But I am annoyed that it picks and chooses for you who owns what land. To be honest I wouldn’t have even cared about most of this if the upgrades I paid for actually worked. | Have to enter cities and countries twice. For example; entering city as Barcelona in Spain won’t show Spain as a country visited. You must enter the country as a different entry. Not worth $8 or anything. A waste. | The app itself is fine. But to use it you must accept terms that you accept unlimited spam from them and their partners. There are other apps that don’t do that. There are plenty of websites that do not for free. | This app REQUIRES you to sign up and forces subscription (says you can op-out at anytime).

You can NOT op-out.  Apple should remove this app as a scam to customers. | I downloaded the app because it also has the list of places, food, capitals, parks, etc.  Unfortunately, the app is missing the option to filter searches. When searching for cities in the US, it shows a list of all the cities in alphabetical order and not by state - it would’ve been convenient to filter the cities by state in addition to having a search. Also, when selecting the destinations visited under the list tab, it does not filter lista by “been” or “want to visit”. | This is a good app and I even paid to remove ads and to unlock all the features. HOWEVER, it needs to give more control to the user. They collect so much of your personal information. It’s like either use it and let us collect these information, or leave it. Also, I was forced to sign up to their newsletter. It said I can withdraw from their newsletter at anytime but there is no option for that in the map. I paid for the premium features but you know what? Don’t. None of the premium features were worth it. Let me start off by cities. You can type and choose the cities that you’ve been to and cities that you want to visit. But that is it. You can’t even see a list of those cities that you want to visit, let alone a map of it. Looks like they made it easy for them to collect our information. Inspiration doesn’t have anything. It said it would show travel photos. The only photo it shows is the thumbnail when you select from want/been. If you do download this app, please do go to privacy section and read the “What personal information do we collect?” Section. So far, what a waste of money it has been. If it gets improved, I will update my review. | After you setup your account, the app requires you to both (1) accept their privacy policy and (2) agree to receive marketing emails from them. If you do not do both, it offers a “Delete Account” option. If you choose that, it then tries to charge you $2.99, rather than simply deleting your data. | Absolutely cool, only one issue though; There should be an option for the places you have lived and where you are currently living to be different. | Be prepared to pay $8.99 the ONLY feature you get for free is to select your countries visited. All other content is to be paid for. There are tons of apps out there for free that will give you that. Save your money. | Can I change the email address associated with my account? | I love this app bec it lets me track the places I have been and gives me stats on the travel I have done ! | Love the app except for 1 part. It doesn’t show the different countries for the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are all separate countries and should be counted as such. | App is trash and waste of time | The app seemed interesting. I downloaded it, installed it launched it. First thing that comes up it  asks for your email. App immediately uninstalled. When will developers learn that people don’t want to be violated to use their app? | X

I couldn’t find explanations or instructions on what’s expected of me to actually book a flight. | Gracias x este servicio de avisar | Please add filters for aircraft manufacturer and model. That will make me start using this app again. Ideally let me save the filter as part of my preferences. | Everything good | I have used Kayake for many years now and find it to be the best app for finding the best deals for traveling. | Use Kayak all the time. Today airport codes are not loading and locations aren’t being recognized | Hey!! I love to travel with Kayak, but I’ve been having problems daily with Kayak that I want to be fixed so I can be able to travel much better with Kayak.

Problem 1.
Sometimes when I search up an airport, I’ve been seeing that the airport that I am searching up for, wouldn’t show up.I’ve been seeing this a lot so please, if you can Kayak, please improve that you can fix this problem I’ve been having daily with.

Problem 2.
Sometimes when I search up a flight, it takes forever to load and even when I go to sleep, it is still loading and will never ever stop.Please Kayak if you can improve that you can fix this problem please do so I can have Kayak much better daily.

Please fix these 2 big problems I’ve been having daily with Kayak.

Thanks!!!!! | Great | Doesn’t even show you the cheapest or best flight options. 
I looked on Vueling for a destination with some specific dates: Direct flight R/T 178€
Kayak’s result for +-3 days around same dates as Vueling’s: 190€ one-stop flight..on Vueling.

🛑App deleted!🛑 | Kayak is not disclosing full price you pay- they didn’t disclose resort fee. I would not have booked it if they had disclosed it. Uninstalling app. Would not recommend | I love you | Very good deals. Thanks. | I love kayak! | Kayak used to be really nice, but now they have opened to scammers like Ovago and Gurufare. | Really good at finding cheap flights | The best option and many deals | The search function has been updated in such a way that it automatically brings you to the “Explore” tab and only shows roundtrips (even if you input One-Way in your search) to a specific airport (i.e. only shows flights to/from MIA even if you enter “Miami Metropolitan Area” in your search, thereby precluding FLL and PBI from the results). These changes have rendered the app useless for the purposes I use it - to compare one way flights from general metropolitan areas (i.e. NYC to South Florida). | Booked a hotel through the app.  It was the worst travel experience ever!  Showed up with our whole family to find out the hotel was over booked and they cancelled our room!  No warning or anything. Had to repack our car and drive another hour to the next available hotel. It was not in a great area and a sketchy place all together.  Even though we never stayed in the room and had all these issue we can’t get a refund!!  Terrible experience. | I’m trying to cancel a hotel reservation. No number, no link to cancel, no cancel button. 
Same thing happened when I tried to cancel a car years ago. Intentional. I’m deleting the app as soon as I get this hotel canceled. | Great UI/UK easy to navigate to find great airfares! | Blocked as bot searching for vacay destinations | This site always seems to be where I start to find my flights | Great site. I can always sort to
My preferences and feel like I get a great rate. | Please add filters to remove boeing airplanes from flights. | I love this way of buying my flights, it is very helpful to find a cheap flight along with my budget. Thankyou so much. | Very good app for flight ticket booking, I had very good experience with the application | Kayak sent an alert of $616  EWR to CDG R/T but when I click, I get everything BUT NOT the ability to book! | Super convenient, affordable, and easy to plan trips around your budget. | I’ve used this app many, many times to get great deals on flights. The explore feature is rad. Very flexible app that if you dig into can really get you a good deal. No joke. | Do not use Kayak. They automate travel sites that also includes scams and upcharges. Use Travelocity. They qualify their partners from my experience. Was charged over $1,000 in travel insurance that was hidden: had to cancel my cc. | How do you have eDream here???? | Me encanta | Confianza y son unicos | Kayak used to be an excellent aggregator if information and direct connection to companies (hotels, airlines). Now they often simply direct you to third party sketchy companies. Not good at all. | Does not allow me to book a rental car through the app. | This app is full of legal scams so do not even trust its partner sights. Book directly with the airline | Great information & excellent cost savings 👍 | Sick and tired of Kayak ads. The more i see them, the more i want to delete the app from my phone. | I love how consistently accurate this app is! | Fantastic price. Always recommend friends and families. Always have better deals | When I want to know the arrival and departures of any flight I used Kayak. It’s always up to date with flight information | I’m noticing a glitch I’ve seen for recent years now in that my nearest airport is drastically higher priced than the other airport nearby PSC. I cross reference with Alaska Airlines website our only rural airline and I discover it hundreds of dollars cheaper sometimes. Please correct! | PLEASE 🙏 THANK YOU 🙏 | 10/10 definitely recommend !! | This is amazing because I can’t find these low prices on the actual website for the airline ✈️😃 | What a great site. Gives the whole picture and has many filters allowing to get only and exactly what you’re looking for!!! Been saving $100’s and still only flying my fave airlines!!! Thank you, Kayak!!! | Kayak is fine but it shows ads, most from UNVERIFIED travel sites some of which are complete SCAMS - Like PriceTravel.

Will add feedback about the condo | I only book through Booking.com ; I’ve been a member since 2019 and haven’t looked back. Their customer service is incredible and I always get the best deals- even internationally! 1000/10 | Can’t reach the hotel.  Can’t reach Booking.  They farmed my reservation out to some company called AIRBIGBUS.  When I did reach the hotel, they did not know about my reservation.  Then I get a message from Booking saying that they don’t always tell the hotel until a few days before you go.  My reservation is non-refundable, so I don’t know if I’m supposed to pay twice just to ensure that I have something. I had to do that for my last trip.  This company isn’t trustworthy. | Appreciate how easy it is to navigate on this app!!! | Very veryvery goood , location and staff was imazing high recomended | I like the hotel so much always Iam staying with you and you provide amazing service,
Thank you for all reception team specially Mr Mahmoud who always and Gulzar | 🤷🏾‍♂️ | Great price and awesome location  to university | بصراحة فندق ولا اروح من خدمة نظافة تعاون كل الشكر لموظفين الاستقبال رجال ونساء متعاونين وطيبين وخلوقين الف الف شكر | My husband and I have stayed the last three summers.  We are pleased with the parking, the location, the cleanliness, the stay. | It is ridiculously user friendly and I love surfing on it for hours just for fun. However they offer me a better deal each time I book an accommodation through this app. 

Also, the filter function gives you the possibility to get what you actually want. I love it | Super easy to book | I’m been using this app for about 8 years love it | I have never been let down by booking.com. They have helped me even in last minute situations | This compay provide its services inside the settlements which are built of stolen Palestinian land ! Boycott booking.com | I have made about 10 bookings through Booking.com. This app doesn’t show all my bookings. 
Have to go through emails to find details about my reservations that  I made through booking.com. | Last minute plans to book a place down Cape Cod made easy when I looked into making reservations with booking.com. Hassel free and pretty easy to sign up. Would use again whenever I need to book a place, thanks booking.com | Great place to stay! Clean and very good location. Loved new window shades! | Was very easy to book.    Got a room right on the beach and was able to pay with Klarna !!!!   So exciting.    Thank you for the easy way to make reservations | Seriously, what a hideous app and user experience when contacting customer service. When you message customer service you cannot add additional information until they have responded back to you. I have an ongoing issue which is up in the ether as I get a bot generated message telling me the message has been forwarded to customer services. No has responded and I cant communicate until then. This was April 10th still no response. If you click the help then a cancel button pops up. I don’t want to cancel I just want my issue resolved! Do better or get better developers! | This flat is very close to the train station. The host is very responsive. Clean place, nice kitchen, good size bath room, the neighborhood is quite. | Booking is easy and efficient! I give it a n enthusiastic endorsement! | Great app | Strongly recommend this application. | It seems impossible to get ahold of an actual person to help me with my issue. I paid for the insurance for the flight and apparently that was a waste because it doesn’t cover cancellations or flight changes. The app keeps asking me for information that was never provided to me. | Very easy to reservation | Good and very convenient | Easy to use, app is great | Everything about this place is perfection. This is what it must feel like to be rich. The staff was incredibly supportive and accommodating. They immediately learned my name and greeted me everytime I came and went.  They were interested in making sure my trip to Cambodia was memorable and took care of every detail without being intrusive.  They were helpful without being pushy. Lina, the manager, spent an enormous amount of time making sure I had wifi on my phone and never made it feel like the inconvenience it was. The room was immaculate, spacious, and beautiful. 
Mr. Kim took care of every detail and followed up to make sure I was satisfied.
As a solo traveler I felt completely safe and comfortable and loved the convenient location of this hotel. 
My only complaint was the noise from the market two blocks away, but the bed was so comfortable I didn’t have any problems falling asleep.  Also, they provided ear plugs i didn’t need.
The food and drinks were also surprisingly delicious and affordable. Staying in this hotel was my favorite part of a three country trip. | Es bien amigable para utilizar, facilita el proceso de reserva | La aplicación es muy afable y siempre segura nunca he tenido ningún contratiempo reservando por esta app | It was very nice to stay here, they are polite hosts✨ the hotel has a very clean environment, the rooms are cleaned in the morning, they also constantly change towels, they have a kitchen both in the room and in the living room, they treated us with a delicious sandwich 🙊 they are very caring and warm, if we come again we will definitely come back here ✨10/10 | I really appreciate all of amazing , cleaning, kindly  staff this is my third time I booked on same hotel, nice and friendly costumer service and so so so clean I want to say thank you to all of management team, and thank you Sohal and Asraf they’re cleaning my room on perfect way and honest people. | Whoever was the chef in musada when i was there should be retained. He or she is so good! | Until it wasn’t anymore.  I found that most hotel stays are now “non-refundable” and I wasn’t offered the insurance option.  I think my booking.com days are coming to an end.  I also found my reservation was cheaper on another app after I had already booked the trip.  Some of my prior stays were terrible and the app doesn’t make up for any unpleasant stays.  A review is the best they can do to help which only helps the next person if at all. | The process was easy and did not take all that much time | App is very easy and simple to use. Very user friendly and all information for hotels very detailed and well organized. Hands down an awesome app a must to have on all smart phones and tablet devices. Booking.com rocks! No worries, free your mind... | Booking.com make it so easy and stress free booking a hotel room and offering all of the services in one place with great prices. I highly recommend Booking.com! Super excited for my upcoming trip to see myGrand babies! | Nikola was such a gem to deal with, in every way. He gave us clear directions, met us on the street when we arrived and even provided us with umbrellas. He was not only a friendly host, but also provided a beautiful property! The view is unmatched and the studio was large. The balcony had comfy furniture and the shower was large! This was by far the best experience I’ve had with a property from booking.com from my month long trip to Europe. Thank you again, Nikola! God bless to you and your family. | Excellent sea view and location, beach entrance just cross the street, staff is care and polite, the price is reasonable, will stay here next time visiting QUY NHƠN | If you’re looking to put your short-term rentals on Booking.com, please save yourself the headache and do not do it. Booking.com customer service is the worst I’ve ever dealt with. Had guests destroy my home and they did nothing to help after telling me for months the “finance department will reach out to me to resolve this issue” months later and countless calls/messages still have not heard a thing. | It was a wonderful, homey, comfy farmhouse. We enjoyed our experience. | Rien à dire sur votre application, on peut effectuer une réservation en toute sécurité sans moins de 2 minutes. | The app is very easy to book a hotel, highly recommended | Booking.com has never failed me! It always has the best prices and recommendations for all of my vacations! 😁 | Arrived at 4:00AM and was happy to make the 6 minute walk to the great apartment. Host provided video of every step for self check-in and we were delighted it all worked quickly. We were provided with a late checkout as requested, and we certainly needed it to get some extra sleep. The kitchen is amazingly well provisioned with everything you could need to prepare breakfast or even a dinner meal.
The entire place was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable.  We highly recommend that you stay in the cozy place. Great communication with the host. | It helps me find and book the best room or site.  I love the map that shows where all the rooms are located by price.  I also love that I can set in depth parameters for my search.

Staff was amazing, quick checkin process. Room was small but updated. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant which was really good. Hotel only has valet parking, which was $60. Not a lot of parking options in the area. | The number of errors in searching, page access errors, inability to download to phone, and internal invalid URLs makes me wonder how they stay in business | I never received an email stating that my rewards were expiring or when they would expire so I saved them for a trip I was planning, Now they take it away with no notice and say theres nothing they can do. This is not how you keep customers and I feel like I have been robbed. | Great hotel, with great views. The staff was impeccable, they couldn’t do enough for us. | The App is a complete failure. When I log into the app it says my email and password does not match. Using the security code fails too. But the website works fine with the same email and password. Customer service tried to blame me saying I must have made some entry error. This has gone on for months since my last trip. Maybe I will use a competing service next trip! | Need ability to get a live person. Need to make a change with no option for it. | Why dont i have options to add a car rental anad or stay on the app when booking a flight? | They are horrible. No matter how hard  you try you will never be able to speak with a representative. They say you can cancel on line. Good luck with that. | Descargue la app pero cuando la abro se cierra automáticamente | The web site seems full of ads and rabbit holes. I found it difficult to get to where I wanted to go. | I loved the room just enough for one person and yes l would return that hotel the Atmosphere was nice. And most importantly the  staff was
Wonderful everyone was so very nice. | This compay provide its services inside the settlements which are built of stolen Palestinian land ! Boycott Expedia | There is no help. I am trying to get two online Expedia accounts merged together as 1. I have an old email and new email but I only need 1 Expedia account. All they want to talk about is my reservation | Delta is horrible   Bought tickets to Rome for my  83 year old and me for June 17 round trip. She has heart failure and had been hospitalized twice we submitted proof and delta would not let me su substitute someone else or refund our money. Told me I could  bring a corpse. Would not give Expedia one star. Expedia would not help at all No credit or 
Money | I love the app and a lot of the amenities but when you have an issue, it is a nightmare, trying to get support that you can actually talk to. | I recently booked a hotel through Expedia. My mistake not checking the reviews first only went by their nice photos.  I purchased the insurance and tried to cancel the reservation but they would not. The hotel was Oyó in Monroe La. Book at your own risk.  

If I could give them some negative stars I would. The guy from the Expedia team gave me a wrong number to some sex line. They were RUDE & VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. DO NOT BOOK | If you miss a lower rate the best Expedia can do is say Sorry | How am I supposed to use the app when it won’t let me sign into it. | They were very accommodating at checking me in early and out late - I’ll have to say even during breakfast a nice man helped me with my tray- very nice and accommodating during my stay. Would definitely stay again. | i was trying to do something but got this pop up 

stop CTA spam | Beautiful hotel and location. great restaurant delicious food and great staff. | I use iphone13 mini.
I could install the app, but it won't open. Keep crashing. | Elle and Gilly went above and beyond while checking in. | Hertz did not have my rental even with rsvp. Other vehicles available but wanted to charge more instead of honor their rsvp and price. Hertz never again!!!! Went to enterprise more professional and better customer service.  

You might want to check your vendor hertz in castleton Indiana. They are scandalous | I booked a flight and I’m trying to check the flight times. The app crashes and now it is saying that my flight is confirmed but it won’t open for me to see the times. | Hotel had no staff after hours and in process of getting refund kept kicking me out of app when switching to get ridiculously long itinerary number and chat is run by people who speak little to no English and inept. First and last time using Expedia app. Before apps they were excellent | This place is great! Very inviting. Smells good. Comfy beds. | Expedia? Or One Key? Or what?
Signed in, but need to sign in again?
Horrible experience | When buying a ticket late. It’s all good. | If you are looking for peace of mind , don't ever book through Expedia..
They as overall perspective is not responsive..i was surprised to see that they don't have flights on their app for certain destinations..😏😏😏😏i Booked few trips but I understood now they are overall poor and don’t want to improve or take feedback , they ll just revert through automated emails or standard formats.. | Unable to sign up and unable to get to my booking.
I would give you a negative star! | Very nice, clean hotel with comfortable beds/pillows. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Plus the location was perfect! Downtown without being right on Broadway, which helps for noise since it is rockin all night. Highly recommend! | Excelente | This app does very little to help with canceled flights or complications while traveling. Generally speaking, it’s very difficult to get help from Expedia. It’s easy to book (give Expedia your money) but anything else besides that is painstakingly horrible. If an airline cancels your flight, Expedia simply gives up and says call the airline. | When and where I love this app | The new rewards system is garbage. Between here and hotels.com I’ve spent tons of money and only got 44$ in rewards. I book all my hotels through here or hotels.com and I can assure you that once I burn through the rewards i have left till be using another travel booking system. | I booked three rooms. I received confirmation for 2 but not the third. I sought help. I received an inadequate response and then the typing in the chat was disabled. Now I have no way to resolve this issue. I just spent over 6k and I cannot get any help. | Did not help. did not give me what I requested. something as simple as the customer service phone number. why is that so difficult, I shouldn’t have to explain to a virtual agent what I wanna talk to real person about. | way to many glitches, i can barely use the app | Five Stars ⭐️ | I had a piece of metal in my meal onboard Korean Airline flight 36 on April 10 2024. I was taking a holiday to celebrate my birthday and the airline failed. They served me metal in my food that broken several crowns and I ended up swallow it. I had to run into the bathroom to go it up the metal so it didn’t cause a blockage or perforation in my intestines or bowel. Which could have been fatal. The airlines nonchalant attitude could have killed me. The airline sent me an email stating they MAY or may NOT pay for the damages. I wasn’t even offered a complimentary upgrade or anything. NEVER FLY KOREAN AIRLINE, or do so at your own risk. I will be speaking with an attorney when I get back to the states. This just isn’t right! | My Expedia hotel reservation was not found while checking in by front desk which made my experience very frustrating. Front desk was able to locate a room at an affiliated hotel for us. I will think twice before going through Expedia again. | Expedia use to have great customer service….not so much anymore! | We really enjoyed our chalet, it was immaculate, comfortable, with beautiful view.  Jane was nice and gave us a warm welcome.  Highly recommended stay. | Not working | This App has given me so much trouble tried to book a trip and it kept telling me no matter how many times I changed the flight the fare wasn’t available to change it. Finally I changed the whole destination and American Airlines triple charged me keeping me from booking my hotel and flight home. COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT | The place was amazing perfect for my stay.
It made the perfect intro to doing sound healing event’s in town near balboa park, the room was very spacious made the stay that more enjoyable, parking was good, that have a parking in garage option, coffee, tea etc.. I want to definitely keep this place on favorites.. | Very horrible customer service agents do not give calls when requested and basically are uneducated on refund policies . I was given 3 completely different answers on my refund by 3 different agents and one of them basically lied to me as they insisted and I have photos of our conversation of the Expedia agent telling me to call British airways that they have a credit for me under my name yet the two times I spoke with British airways they said they refunded Expedia and Expedia needs to refund me so on my 2,000 $ ticket I am left so far dry with no refund for my return leg which I could not take and  I am going nuts because  hate Expedia customer agents only chat and when I ask for a phone call I get nothing and they give me wrong answers as well . I need a lawyer | I booked a trip to NY because my daughter was giving birth on April 25 so I booked a flight on April 24 and return on April 28 My daughter had complications and they were delivering her a week earlier I called Expedia customer service which was horrible it took about an hour just to figure out how to talk to a human being I informed them that I went to airport and worked with delta and they did a credit and it cost an extra 100 to change no problem they got me on next flight out on Wednesday I called Expedia to change my return flight after I already called Frontier airlines and they said I had to talk with Expedia because i booked with them I called Expedia finally got a human and they did absolutely nothing I just wanted to thank you from bottom of my heart for

We go to NYC often and love trying new hot spots and OOO always has the best options. 5 stars!! | I’m struggling to find places in the app. Things like local restaurants and even museums are “not found”. | Cool app and an upgrade from Yelp, specifically geared to travelers. Ability to find community through recommendations and get a real time look in at what people are doing across the world. | Explain for the life of me why Philadelphia is not listed. I see South Philadelphia and Philadelphia county and someplace called new Philadelphia. I don’t see Center City Philadelphia or just simply Philadelphia in general I don’t understand. | This app has a great concept for planning trips, however is very slow when searching destinations to add. | Very glitchy - takes a long time to load. Shows all results of things to do, after you put in the location, to places in completely different countries!! | The map feature only shows you the most recent 10 recommendations. To see them all I have to scroll and load each recommendation which takes FOREVER. And when I click into any recommendation, I lose my place and have to start over. So it’s virtually impossible for me to actually see all my recommendations laid out. So disappointing, I’ll have to just use google maps | Before you begin there is a short questionnaire which asks who you are traveling with. I put family and children, yet when I inserted my travel destination and had an itinerary generated, it recommended things that were not kid friendly.

Additionally, the questionnaire asks what your budget looks like. Although I chose the lowest bracket, it recommended five star restaurants that were completely unaffordable for me. 

There were a couple hidden gems in the recommendations, but overall it isn’t worth the space it would take up on my phone unless some more moms joined the community to beef up the kid and budget friendly recommendations. | Looking for a great planning tool that allows you to share with others in your group. This is the one, nice layout and many recommendations for your area of stay. | I could not for the life of me figure out how to see any reviews for places in a city. Whoever designed the ui for this app should be fired. | I want to live this app but it’s certainly glitching on me. I’m clicking on what I know is a restaurant I have saved in San Fran and it’s saying it’s a beach. | Great to find people who like what you like, so you can get a better idea of what you may like in new places.

I’ve added a bunch, and the location are off. For example, upstate NY is occasionally included in NYC and 2 of my Japanese restaurants in NYC are being listed as a cathedral location. | I love the concept of the app, but some features don’t work or don’t have a real purpose. It’s really hard to just search an area without looking at someone else’s list. When you search something and add it to a list, the UI just throws you back to a random place and you have to start your search over again. Needs some work on user experience, but I’ll keep using and hope bugs get fixed! | People use Apple Maps for the same use as an app like this. This is just a places finder. So no point and not recommended. | So excited to use this app! Look me up and share your travel tips! @bohemianspirit | I love this app—so helpful for planning trips! If I have one suggestions, it’s that I wish you could add comments/reminders to yourself when you add a place to a trip (e.g., what dish everyone loves at a restaurant). I think you can’t add notes like that when you’re planning, only once you’ve marked it as a recommendation. | I use OOO both for finding new restaurants and as a quasi-travel diary so when I go back to a city I can remember my own favorites! 

With fake reviews / AI seeming to be on the rise on other sites, it’s fantastic that OOO allows you to filter by reviews of people you know. | I love this app, but I think it’s going to take some updates and improvement before this app becomes trendy. Users should be able to categorize places manually because some of them are incorrect—e.g., it lists one of my hotels as something to “do” instead of as a place to stay—and there is no way to change it. I also saved a recommendation in Utah and it is showing up as a location in Michigan. But I would love to see this app grow and for more people to start using it, it has such awesome potential!! | You’re only able to make itineraries with limited items. I work really hard to find hidden gems so it doesn’t really make sense that I can make an itinerary using only the most popular spots | The best way to make the perfect itinerary for all your stops & trips 😍 | Love all the features so far, but how can I make a reservation as I don’t see how you do it using open table. Is a booking feature coming soon? | Not only is the brand name perfect. I love how the app is designed and it’s features. I can definitely see this app being a must have for travellers with a few extra features. 
I use it to plan my trips and save my must go to places. It’s been super handy! 

I would love to see a option on the trips section to share the itinerary via PDF. I can imagine it would look perfect to share with friends who don’t use the app or if you are planning a trip for a family member. 

Keep up the great work! I’m a super fan! Finally an app that not only is pretty but also super useful 🫶🏼 | I love this app. Just starting to use it and I am in love with the My trips part of it. Love being able to add places of interest with times for each day! The only thing is that some of the places I rec show incorrect info on my page. I recommended a place in Utah Wyoming and the final place on my place is showing Ann Arbor, MI. Another is showing incorrect town with a picture that had nothing to do with my review.  Also the feedback does not work on the app. Unable to send any feedback. | EDITS:
Would also love to see the ability to add a “manual” item- for example: hop-on, hop-off bus tours. Would be super helpful to leave a review and just save my pictures and notes from the experience for keepsakes.

This could easily be the next big social media craze, especially with travel coming back! I love the concept: plan and document all my trips in one place, with ability to recap them in the perfect mix of photos and written descriptions, WITH A SCHEDULE :) so I can easily pass down detailed plans. Amazing. BUT, there are definitely features missing before it can go viral… I’d love to see: - The ability to add photos to a place just for you/even if you don’t “rec” a place, so I don’t have to post personal pictures to the internet if I want to use it like a social network with a cute recap of me and my partner on a trips’ pictures for our friends and family. This would go along great with better privacy/sharing settings, so I can share my trips and photos and comments/notes with people, allow others to add comments who are tripmates and maybe a “view only” tier with public/private comments for what I want a friend to be able to see (if someone from work asks for trip recs, but maybe I don’t want them to see my reservation notes on a place but do want them to see my review). | As a travel agent, I LOVE using this app to build trips for my clients. Once all of your activities/hotels/restaurants are loaded, my clients are able to click on the itinerary and everything shows up on the map in their app, which saves them  TONS of time from having to Google everything individually outside the app. Super trendy, modern, and unique recs from all the users. Such a fun travel space to be in! | Amazing for travels recs and finding new places.  I’ve been sending lists of my recs for years and now this makes it so much easier to share with friends! | I hope more people use it, such a cool idea | A really awesome function that should be incorporated in to this beautiful app would be a visually appealing countdown feature for “My Trips”. A bonus would be the ability to create a Home Screen widget for your countdown as well! | So much potential. I got so excited for this app and to use it but has a few problems. This is my first ever review on here because guess what? Your feedback option does not work. You click on submit and does nothing. Do you guys not test your app after updates?
Also, does anybody who works for this app ever use it at all? If so, you can easily catch the glitches and what needs to be fixed. For example, when you click the “back” button, it doesn’t really go back to the previous page you’re on. When i am checking out another person’s profile, clicks on their recs, and then tries to go to back to their page, it doesn’t. It leads me back to my profile! It is so annoying. Please fix this. The app is way too focused on “aesthetic” but has no quality. Way too many problems. | I love this ap!! I love having lists for all my trips in one place, love the aesthetic, & the map feature ! 

I would LOVE to be able to make my own notes for businesses that only I can see. That way any research I’ve done on the place can be there too. For example- a place that doesn’t take reservations for breakfast, I’d like to note that :) | Love the look and design of this app, and the concept and information you get for trips is amazing!! Really helpful to create your own trip folders or wishlists all in one place with pictures, location etc etc. convenient and helpful to get you to all the places you’re wanting! 

The docked star is due to some interface annoyances through using the app. When clicking into someone’s recommendation from a trip and clicking the back arrow it brings you all the way back to the search page rather than that person’s trip to continue looking through their reccos. So you have to find your way back to where you were if you want to continue browsing. | Love this concept and the ease of use of the app. As a business owner, I wish there was a way we could edit information that isn’t correct, such as hours of operation. I understand the concept is for this to be different than Yelp, just wish we could provide accurate information. | This app is a beautiful way to plan trips and to remember past trips. | So helpful to see hometown recommendations! Love love love this app and can’t wait to see all the new features that get added 🙌🏽 | As someone who loves traveling and giving recs, this is perfect. Still needs some things worked out,   Like my profile picture and background photo do not load or show? probably a bug issue. Also I would love it if you were able to have a tab with a grid of all the photos you’ve took at locations, similar to Instagram, and the ability to change the main photo on your profile of trip locations. Otherwise great app can would love to see this grow | While I’m pretty proud of the state of my travel spreadsheets, this app blows them away. The social aspect, easily saving and sharing ideas with friends, make planning so much easier. | Pros:
+ GPS enabled search
+ Clean, intuitive functions
+ Collaborative space

Cons:
- does not map from location to location
- there’s no default view of a trip to show the entire itinerary, you have you click day by day 
- you can’t share trips to Instagram stories, there should be an attractive easy display for sharing on social media 
- there is no FAQ or feedback section in the app to suggest changes 
- you cannot make notes about a location or place you select for your trip, therefore I still prefer using notes over this app until it adds features

I am happy to use this app for an upcoming trip and will provide an updated review if the app features are updated. | I love this concept! The app is super easy to navigate and fun to use. I love logging all of the places I’ve been to, because it both helps give people I know recommendations, and it gives me a nice memory bank of where I’ve been. I used this to plan a recent trip, and it was such a neat way to keep track of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do. Love the map feature to see where in a city my friend’s recommendations are, and to find where my next stop is on vacation! | Love all the features so far. Genius idea!! When I’m planning trips, especially international trips, I use google maps to organize the itinerary based on location and proximity. I’m def gonna start inviting friends to join to make our lives easier. 
 For more effective itinerary planning, I would suggest adding the following:
1. Times
2. Option to add attachments, videos or images because some of the images don’t do these places justice)
3. Finally notes within scheduled places (as shown in the previews) and also notes to add activities that are not listed. 

I also love how the map shows the proximity of places to each other but is it possible to add a feature where we can see the actual distance from one place to another and perhaps driving directions? Currently, google maps only opens for directions to one place. | truly changes the game | Really great concept and I love the user friendliness. However, each time I try to see a list of someone’s recs on their page (or even my own), the recs do not load. The only way I can see recs is by searching a city right now. Needs an update probably

UPDATE: it works fine. This ^ was only happening for a few hours the first day. Really cool app! | Great for planning trips and sharing recommendations with friends! | It’s so awesome that you can put locations on the day you plan to visit but why not add time? It’s not a full function collaboration or trip planing tool if you can’t plan times in your day. | Cool app. Will definitely be using in future travels. Just wish there was an option to add your own photos and notes. Could possibly make this option private or public for others to see. | There are many things I love about this app. I just started using “plan my trip”.  
Not only am I adding all the places/ things I want to do as I prepare but this will also serve as a record for me for future,  Have u ever tried to remember that little restaurant you had stumbled across but couldn’t. Just park it here. | Love the app, such a great concept, very user friendly, and very great aesthetically. Just one thing- please make an update where you can make folders within each city of recommendations so that we can distinguish between food recs/activities/shopping, etc. Right now they are all in one category under each city and I’m afraid my recommendations will get lost in the sauce and get confusing if I keep adding to it! Would love a bit of organization and categories within each city. Thank you! | I’m already obsessed with the app as-is. It’s been. A very practical, helpful tool for trip research & planning - especially for group trips with friends or family. I don’t have a ton of friends on the app yet, so my planning process is still to go to Pinterest or travel blogs for ideas and then I save my wishlist things to do in Out of Office. If they keep building out additional features that make it more useful, building a user base I want to follow, and create more opportunities for engagement across users, this app will be an absolutely must have for anyone who enjoys a trip! | I love to see what friends and influencers that I follow are doing when they travel. Places to stay, eat, sights to see! I sometimes DM people and ask but this makes it so much easier especially when planning a trip and giving others recommendations. 10/10 recommend! | This is hands down one of the most beneficial travel apps I have ever used. For someone who loves to travel the reviews and recommendations have been spot on! Can’t wait to use the app on my next trip! | A user friendly interface that’s so easy to use! And because I trust my friends (and some influencers), it makes picking my hotel or restaurant so simple! Why didn’t someone think of this sooner?
