Thank you Trendyol, I think I, finally, found a reliable store to lean on it. | Very easy to use love it😍 | استخدموا كود خصمي enaas
تراني فعلا أشتري لنفسي ومنت أشتري منه دايما قبل ما يفتح في السعودية 🤍 | الصباحية ق١ش٥منزل٦٣١ | ممتاز | Waiting for support helps me with the problem regarding the return of funds. The only thing i got is ignoring during whole month. I tried writing to different mail addresses (i found 3) even couple times. Trendyol assistant in app is absolutely useless, no one calls me back as it was promised. Same thing with calling center. Can’t say nothing bad about products quality and delivery time, but i have no more way to get your attention. | رووووعه احلا برنامج | اتمنى لكم التوفيق جدا ممتاز | Musteri hizmetleri cok bilgisiz ve yardimci olmuyoor | The company, which has been making us struggle for days to return the product we bought, is also trying to harass us by offering different excuses by accepting the return of the product even though the seller sent another product, please do not shop. | شكرا | فرو | وذ | They didn't collect all the items in one package they send it one by one | 😍 | تعامل سيء ومهنية جداً تعبان الحين طلب له ١٤ يوم مايوصل وهم يقولون لا تقلق لا اطلب فلوس المشتريات يقولون لا تقلق الي تسونه مش قلق للعميل لا جداً ما انصح للتسوق منهم اله اذا كان الدفع عند الاستلام وبعد ماانصح غير التسوق الي يكون عندك ابرك من شي ماتعرفة… | حي لبن مدينة الرياض | افضل برنامج تستطيع ان تتسوق منة وانت مرتاح الأسعار فوق الخيال | جيد | Esimin aylik standart olarak kullanip en az 10 bin lira harcadigi bu uygulamayi Galatasaray dusmani programlara sponsor oldugu icin ikimizinde telefonundan silip, sponsorluklarini bitirene kadar bir daha kullanmama karari aldik. Haksizlara canak tutanlara kurus yok. | من خیلی این اپو دوست دارم 
کلا باهاش سرگرمم خیلی🤣 | Fiyatlar pahali avantaji kalmadi | لكن أسعاره اوفر | طلبت طلبات كثيرة و وصلت كلها الا السروال والمقاسات صغيرة بصفة عامه لازم تطلب مقاسات أكبر.
وفي الحقيقة اقرب محل ملابس في الحي جودته أفضل منه. | Poor quality , mistakes in goods purchased . Wrong product, wrong size | تم طلب طقم كامل ووصل منه بلوفر فقط ورفضوا ارسال بقية القطع | هذا التطبيق مره ممتاز والاسعار مره ممتازة انصح بيه للامانة التوصيل مجاني كمان والعروض ماتوقف بدل تدفع 80ريال في تيشرت واحد تدفعو في اربعة او خمسه تيشرتات | احلا متجر | En nefret ettiğim şey özenerek hazırladığım tüm koleksiyonlarım kayb oldu. Tüm hevesim kaçdı. Kç zamandır bekliyorum belki gücelleme gelir de düzelir. Ancak biraz önce güncelledim yine aynı durum. Berbat! | مايستاهل ولا ربع نجمه | Ok | طلبت منهم طلبيتين و وحده منهم جاء المنتج بجودة سيئه و الخياطه مو مره و الثاني وصلني منتج غير المنتج اللي انا طلبته و الترجيع و اعاده الحال ياااخحذذذ ووقققتتتتت
اول و اخر تعامل معهم كتطبيق | نصب واحتيال في الأسعار 
في البداية يكون السعر برقم معين ثم يتغير السعر اذا غيرت المنطقة للملكة العربيه السعودية 
سجلت فيديو للشاشه اثبات للاحتيال | لا توجد فيه كل البراندات اردى الانواع فقط والسعر خمسة اضعاف السعر الحقيقي للسلع مقارنة مع التطبيق التركي لذلك يجب مقاطعته | كذب وبهتان التخفيض في العرض غير وفي السلة غير | تطبيق رائع وسهل الاستخدام | Harikasin trend yol | تخفيضات ممتازة | السلام عليكم وحمة الله وبركاته 

توجد ملاحظة عند التسوق من المتجر يظهر السعر منخفض وعند وضع المنتج فالحقيبه يرتفع السعر ويصبح مختلف  ؟! 
مدة التوصيل يفضل تكون في خلال اسبوع واحد ولا يكثر عن ذالك  
.

تحياتي | A note for you, learn English and add it to your website. Not everyone knows Turkish. | But can you pleeeeeease add English, I don’t understand turkish and the reason that keeps me deleting this app every now and then; it’s because of the language. 

Thank you if you’re going to do something about it. | موقع سيئ جدااااا! نسبة الامان فيه ضعيفة فجاءه القى ايميل غير ايميلي مسجل واكلم خدمة العملاء يقولون معليش مانقدر نغيره! انتبهوووو على بطاقاتكم لاتنسرق الموقع سيئ | Nice | the app is really good and the app works very well | Trendyol for the win!

And I’ve done a lot of shopping | I love the prices and products | It’s a wonderful great blessing app you can use if Amazon is to high this is the next best option I love this app I personally recommend it you won’t regret it you can count on it | I have placed several orders with Temu now. And I have been totally satisfied with each order. All the items I have received have been top-of-the-line. They have been exactly as advertised. And the prices are absolutely incredible. I had a problem with only one item, and it was taken care of immediately and very satisfactorily. The only thing I would say, is as far as clothing goes, always check the size guide to find out what size you should order. All the clothing does not run the same size. 1X on one shirt may not be the same size as a 1X in another shirt. But as long as you check the size guide you should not have any problem. I have turned my friends on to Temu. And they have turned their friends on to Temu. And everyone is very very satisfied with Temu. So I would just say give it a try. I really think you’ll be happy you did. | Excelente app | Clothes come in true to size and razor blades are as described. The price is good. The quality of clothes are good, but not great. The razor blades are as described. The slippers I got lacks bulkiness and strength, but it’s still a good buy for the price. Would recommend!! | Best app to shop in the description reels it a lil I actually do shop like a billionaire it’s the best app I’ve installed I give it a five star and you should to cause it’s an awesome app | Temu has been consistent with me and that’s what matters. | I like Temu really great! | Too bad you could get the same quality and sell it at the same price you do now and still make a decent profit even with paying your employees that make them living wages. | I love temu so much i think temu should stay as long cause temu sell cheap stuff that I don’t have to get from the store . So temu rule | I m so happy. | I never received my order!!! I tracked the package and after a few days it said it was delivered. I NEVER RECEIVED IT!!! Has this happened to anyone else??? HELP | I have ordered so many things from Temu and have only been disappointed with very few items. | Satisfied | I did the free gift thing, and it got to 1 cent left. And when I invited my friends it said I got 10 cents off, but it still said it was at 1 cent. Completely a scam. 1⭐️ | It is very seldom that I buy something from Temu and it comes to my home in adequate 99.9% of things that I buy are absolutely wonderful they look beautiful on me I’m going to share and put some videos on the website of my dresses, I’ve only had to return two thingssince I started using Temu so I can say that’s 100% excellent I never have a problem with a return or with a refund being put back onto my Visa card Temu..is absolutely an exceptional company to me. I would suggest anyone who has never tried it to try it 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 | Everything is wonderful and cost-effective! | I enjoy temu but I don’t like how shipping take too long. | TEMU has made it possible to afford even general necessities for today’s economy we hv recently been put on a fixed income so TEMU prices are efficient | Love Temu, the price is very good. Love your items, very pretty , well designed  ,good quality and  all  the items are packed professionally and well presented. I will  recommend Temu higher. 
 Believe me you won’t be disappointed.

Thankyou so much. | Todo está en buen estado | Temu is a amazing Shopping app & Love it ❤️🙏🏻 | So far the products I have ordered work great! The Prices are awesome! I will continue to order from here. One thing though, the carrier that delivers to my area this last time was not so great. Extremely late! But just be patient it will eventually get there. So, if you are wanting something at a certain time you need to way in advance. Just in case! | Me gusta todo lo que compre | موقع رائع وانصح بيه بجد اشياء جميله | I loved this app | 99.4 enserio todo mentira | I love this app. I can spend all day scrolling. The deals are great.

6446901002,"com.burbn.barcelona","Threads, an Instagram app","https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002?uo=4","Say more with Threads — Instagram’s text-based conversation app.

Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world.

A few things you can do on Threads…

■ Access your Instagram followers
Your Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.

■ Share your point of view
Spin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.

■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators
Jump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.

■ Control the conversation
Customize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. 

■ Find ideas and inspiration
From TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.

■ Never miss a moment
Stay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.

■ Open social networking – coming soon
In the future, there will be ways to discover more content and reach wider audiences: we are planning features that allow you to search for, follow and interact with users on open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.

I have a private account, but I used to be able to comment on anyone’s thread! | The app constantly logs me out even though I use it every single day and often minutes after I post something. Then, when I go to post something on Threads, I get a notification that Instagram logs me out and I have to stop and close the app just to reopen it and log back in. I don’t know what you people did, but you screwed up this app. UPDATE: there’s still not fix for the issue of forced logging off. | are you serious? | Why is it that there is so much scamming going on with the social media | Protingai išgalvota programa. 
Tikious daug padidės ateiti, įdomu ir padeda susijungti su intelektualais ir humanitaro mokytojais čia. ⌨️ *Threads* | Genial | Simply entertaining 👌👌👌 | Fine just download it and see if you mesh | ‏سلطنة عمان مسقط الغبرة الشمالية | stop trying to get us to use this app | Am new to Threads this week. So far I am appreciative that this App seems more informative and topic related. Not meaningless viral stuff with constant prompts to buy Advertising, Likes and Followers. Will be more active once I get more free time. | Yeah wow | This is a scam app that will steal hundreds from your Apple account. | How do I remove it? | Unfortunately not a good replacement for Twitter due to the weird promotion of sports and entertainment and the inhibition of politics. What can we expect from the oligarchy though. | So far so good! Kind of nice to have fresh and new👍 | The Threads team hit it out of the park. It is genuinely a better experience than “the other place”. Keep it up! | 🤩 | Stop forcing everyone to do what YOU want on this freaking app. Not being able to remove this badge from the tops of our accounts and FORCING us to download the app to remove notifications is STUPID. Having the badge and notifications is incredibly annoying. | I love Threads and the content that shows up on my thread. 🫶🏾 | The latest update has made Threads almost impossible to enjoy. Posts seem to be presented in no logical order. It’s difficult to find the accounts that I follow as they seem to be mixed with random other accounts. What’s going on Meta? | I love to write & communicate in brief carefully worded notes through text& email, this is a fun addition for me. | I am having major problems with this app. I have downloaded it a couple of times and each time it freezes. I can’t get it. Nothing!!!! I updated and nothing. It just freezes up. | Man yall gotta do better | It’s not user friendly.  Confusing. | Watching my cat stack stacks on the racks tip toeing on tacs | Threads When you’re in the all tab and when Account adjust to you so like the app is just new account. Can you please bring a feature? We can turn that off in that section so if you don’t want that on and you just want it on in a different section in the app that would be great. so in the app recommends you certain accounts you might be interested in. Can you please bring a feature that you want it in a different tab you don’t want it in that section in the app. | There’s nothing to do on this dumb app it’s literally like instagram and facebook I absolutely don’t recommend this app it’s a waste of your time and a waste of your storage. | The best social network ever!💕 | Enjoying threads | Buenos días | This app was good for about a week,  then I couldn’t see any comments in any of the accounts that I follow. | Removing the Following Feed was the most colossally stupid thing to do. Why do you think we follow accounts? So we can hunt for them in a feed you’ve decided we can see? You’re making the app unusable to the point of pointlessness with this change. | Ive been using Threads since it 1st started and the growth has been tremendous. 

I’ve enjoyed the user interface and how easy to use it is. The community that I’ve gravitated too has been NBA Threads. The discourse of fandom along with high lQ basketball convos has been awesome. 

I also love the connection with my IG account too along with networking with bigger accounts. Love it! | Be been loving this app, and the people I’ve met on it. I use it daily, and find it easy. They update regularly to add new features, and the community seems largely supportive. This last update has ruined it. It now makes my eyes strain far more than it used to, and other apps don’t have the same issue. This is a big issue, and will definitely minimize my use of the app. | Pruébalo esta bueno | Threads stands out as a sanctuary for artistic souls, offering impeccable curation of diverse talents. Every scroll unveils captivating content, from intricate illustrations to breathtaking landscapes. The platform fosters a vibrant community of like-minded individuals passionate about art, fostering engaging discussions and support. With its user-friendly interface, navigating Threads is a seamless experience, integrating effortlessly into daily routines. Overall, Threads is a must-have for anyone seeking inspiration and connection in the world of creativity. | Ive had this app for 2 months now and I still font know why. | If ur all about clout then it’s for u. I live life not a fairytale | Threads is very awkwardly and badly designed. Not user friendly at all! Mostly I cannot see any responses to either my own threads or to others’. Only occasionally does it work to click on an amorphous space right below where it says replies! Why??? Is Meta trying to make the worst social media app ever? | LOVE | Threads is a positive space for creatives and others to share ideas. | Awesome app | Meta in its infinite wisdom has decided that no one can follow more than 7500 accounts (which is quite low given they do not support Lists which would allow you to put accounts for your different interests in diff Lists), that users aren’t interested in following political accounts & that there is no need for usable search, help or customer support systems.

I was willing to let things slide but it’s been out a while now and it’s time they made it useful for the bigger accounts that would drive more users to it. | Threads is an wonderful app for sharing your thoughts and opinions about American culture. As the pioneers of freedom of speech, Threads allows its users to communicate with like minded individuals domestically and abroad. When considering a social media app to utilize for your daily needs, please consider using Threads. | It took way longer than it needed to but it’s finally up to par with the competition. Features are also appearing shortly after being requested, which is kind of nice. | I love the love support of nice people online it’s a fun way to express, thank you instagram 🥰😍😍 | Would also be nice to have a Vision Pro app. I’m not using a browser.

It was a great experience. | I hate chrome and Google | Blabalablaabal | From the title you can see that google chrome almost got me hacked.my security app saved me from getting hacked my opinion don’t use chrome as your browser | You can tell from the title | Opening screen on the new chrome has a lite blue cast than I can not remove. By bookmarks do not stay on the list I open, each time I return after selecting Th file I want to view I have to go through the path over and over to select the next address. Bookmarks used to stay in the folder I opened until I selected a different folder . I want my old chrome back. I don’t see a place to fix this. The word SHORTCUTS appears on the small window in chromes opening screes and I don’t need or want that. Cant find a place to remove it. The help menus on chrome.com is not helpful and I most definitely NEED HELP😢 | I don’t know how google works around all the privacy settings offered (and used) by Apple but it seems able to get everything it wants from information that should be protected. Don’t ever waste your time searching for something specific to view or change because the simplest help search results in no relevant context regardless of how you reword it or dumb it down. Zero credibility there and of course you can click on the link saying it’s not relevant or helpful 1000 times but you can’t find a link or human being that can help. It’s gonna go and I’m going to try to get all my information to something more reliable than google. | Well Google almost has the answer to everything lol | No, I see google almost everywhere I don’t want to see it here. | Great | In your matter in your security I just been careful I know you are everywhere ❤️👌 | Logging in is difficult. | This app is so awesome 😎 and it has to many websites to visit 📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺 | Terrible | Works very well, and takes me anywhere I need to go, no complaints here | No, I do not want to sign in to my google account everywhere

Update: Google, quit being evil | Unable to access 3rd party keyboards. | User friendly search engine | No me because I would like some support so far I have not had any . I’m very angry that google has allowed a USB security key on all of my accounts I have told them time and time again I do not have a USB security key. That I have a fingerprint passkey I have no interest In USB security key either | This is the best thing you can do when getting a new computer or phone. Chrome keeps up with all your bookmarks no matter what device you sign into Chrome on. Tabs are easy to manage, it is just a better browser. 

I feel like I have my own computer or phone no matter what device I’m on. Google open on chrome is like having the Internet at your fingertips! | Good | Chrome has been going downhill on my devices for a while now. Sometimes images just don’t load, the entire app freezes and I have to restart it, sometimes going back and forward in the browser don’t work correctly. Sometimes websites just don’t load, while they do on safari. It’s becoming a real hassle. | Thanks for the great job and your informative review of what you did. | Ads on mobile websites are too intrusive and distracting. Enough is enough, we need support for ad blocking extensions in the Google search app and in the mobile chrome browser on iOS. Also work with mobile websites to enforce more user-friendly standards for advertisements. That or ranked them lower in the search results and news feed. I constantly use the Google feed and then just open these websites in Safari using the share sheet, since Safari supports ad-blocking extensions. And yes, I know Google’s business model is advertising based. But you have to enforce good behavior in ads around the web because the experience is now like MySpace. | What is a search anymore but an opportunity for Google to get paid. Absolute trash, can’t wait until AI eats Google’s lunch. | 抖音 | It’s kinda really slow | Despite the app being a bit slow at times, the most detrimental thing to my user experience is that I will leave a tab open to return to, only to find it has rearranged itself somewhere within the other tabs. It makes it difficult to find the one I’m searching for, especially when I have 80+ tabs open. Please just leave them in chronological order!! | Haven’t been using it much so I can’t really give a rating on it | Total invasion of your privacy. Literally everything you do is collected and monetized. | I should be able to open more than 5 or 6 tabs before they all stop rendering and go blank, but I can’t. 

Google also seems to be making it harder to use the app, forcing you to spend more time looking for what you opened it up for. This is for the advertisers benefit to maximize googles ad revenue. The changes are not to make browsing faster or better for the users. | Instead of swiping to move between private mode and shared tabs, provide users with the option to choose whether swiping closes the page or switches between modes. | Do you have computer bugs or viruses? | For some reason Imgur doesn't work even in incognito mode. | Usually like chrome but putting this shortcuts bar on my home screen and not giving me an option to remove it going to cause me to delete the app and just use safari. I do not want this whatsoever. Please fix asap before I completely removed chrome | I have always loved google chrome but ever since I started the college search process I have many different college websites open, but I hate the fact that I can’t group these tabs on my phone. Wish this was an option for phone users | Browser opening normally during business hours yesterday June 7, 2023 for few hours just to be crushing after few hours of use by 5-6 PM EST and not Opening at all and Crushing on Start since MAY, 2023!

than it seems to have ever felt. The only…..only..way we could have had a better life without him, and the rest of the “family time”is just as valuable to me now STILL HAS NO IDEA HOW MUCH MORE OF HIS OWN LIFE IS HIS LIFE AND HIS OWN RIGHT NOW IS THE ONE THAT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN DO WHAT HE CAN DO TO.

Vivian and Bryce.. have to do this and you know how you have a good relationship with the best way to do this is by having 2 siblings together with each other’s parents to blame. You know what you can be proud of? original idea is a lot more important but I have to agree with your statement that you should have the right idea of the time for 7th grades  inn school to get their own place firstborn, to learn more of what you do in your own time, too. You can also pay attention to your own personal time and space for that time to be spent learning to be more active in school and not being afraid to take on more responsibility in the world than your parents do and the fact that is still a big challenge for your future. And in your own life as well as the present time to be able to make sure you pay attention to the present past and future as your lil sister and brother are doing well as they have been through this whole time you know that I am so proud to be your mom and mommy, to learn more of the things you want to be able to teach them about. When we were on our way to the Wednesdays we had to leave the house to get to the houses. We didn’t have to do anything but we were in a lot more than we could handle and it took us about 2yrs to find a new understanding that we were in this mess that was really difficult to deal with at that time because of the way things had to change so quickly and we didn’t know how to do things at all but we were in this situation we were so much more than a bit more prepared for the time that we needed to be together so it took us and we didn’t really know what we needed until we had to do it. We just didn’t know when we had to be able to get the house back together and we didn’t have the space for a little while so we had to go back to our old place and put a new one on top of the 2 yrs later was not even thought we had to be apart from that time period we had Wednesdays. I love you so much baby for being so nicer to Vivian and Bryce too. Try! My love, my first born son is my best boy… and I ever had the opportunity to MY FIRST EVER BEING BORN WITH YOU BILLY JR. is mommy too!!! 💙™️💭🎶💬💙💙 | I use this browser to use YouTube a lot.

Paul and Nancy Dango | I like chrome because it can really get stuff done. It’s not like Google or Google basically tells you how to do things chrome actually is like a key to being able to be more accessible to the web and look what you want up and it works good same as being they’re good, I think that they should put a wireless router in the towers for cell phones so everyone has Wi-Fi because we pay enough for the phones anyway we need Wi-Fi merged with mobile Internet just make it stronger.

The service by our waitress Hanna was impeccable, and she was very sweet to offer my daughter a birthday cheesecake desert on the house!

Quit being evil. | There's a minor issue within the history tabs. I can't see my recent history | I really like the news aggregation of the app. However, as I am scrolling and reading through news stories it will randomly update the whole feed and I lose the other interesting articles on my feed. This happens so randomly it’s quite annoying. Sometimes when I am reading or if I leave the app for 1 second to take care of another notification. When I come back I watch as the app decides it needs a refresh and watch all the news stories disappear in front of me. I wish it would only update when I tell it to update. | This app not updating | Quité esta aplicación ya que me molestaba cada vez que abría me preguntaba todo el tiempo que acepte las cookies no me gustaba para nada. | I hate the new update for saved tabs because I had stuff I was using it to hide now it’s right there if someone decides to go through my phone!!! | I always try to type up my favorite brand and if it isn’t a small brand it takes 50 tries 70 reset of my electronic to just get it to put on the website and then save you something with that Internet.

I love google and it helps me with a lot of things | Why are my open tabs (tiles) randomly rearranging themselves? Extremely frustrating having to find them when multiple tabs/ tiles open! I never experienced this problem until a month or two ago. 

Is it a glitch in the app or is there something in settings to correct this that I’m not finding?

Otherwise I love the Google app along with many of my other Google services! If this issue is resolved I’d give the app 5 stars.

Enough is enough, we need support for ad blocking extensions in the Google search app and in the mobile chrome browser on iOS. Also work with mobile websites to enforce more user-friendly standards for advertisements. That or ranked them lower in the search results and news feed. I constantly use the Google feed and then just open these websites in Safari using the share sheet, since Safari supports ad-blocking extensions. And yes, I know Google’s business model is advertising based. But you have to enforce good behavior in ads around the web because the experience is now like MySpace. | I was trying to reset my password bc I didn’t know it and it said “What’s your password “ LIKE THATS WHAT IM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT | With Google I can find so many interesting things!

And now they made that unclickable because somehow “there are more secure options” like downloading their pointless app so they can passively collect more data from your phone.

Ick. | Thanks | Dear WhatsApp technician teams I would like to see to my WhatsApp for me because I can’t post anything on status please would like you to do something about it for me thank you.. | Thank u for WhatsApp… it is the best platform for communication, I would love to see an update for posting videos fully instead of 30secs a post. Thank u…
Please allow editing of messages for a longer time | WhatsApp is widely used to communicate internationally, thus it is bewildering that it still does not have a translation feature. Facebook, it’s parent, has translation built-in. | I decided to use the extra security and implement the 64 encryption key tool. I saved all the numbers in four different places I had copies of it. I had screenshot. I wrote all the numbers down and saved them in several places so that I would not lose my WhatsApp data.

When I had to reinstall my WhatsApp. The app told me the key was wrong. I know the key was correct. I lost all my data. I lost so much important information. I can’t begin to tell you the magnitude of  info I lost. 

Do NOT use that encryption key unless you are prepared to lose all vital data in your WHATSAPP account. | It keeps making me think people have blocked me | Que pasa? | Love who created this | I have tried to register my phone number and it kept saying try again in 1 hour. Fix this! | App keeps closing on it’s own while I’m using it. I have done every troubleshoot they’ve suggested but it’s still crashing. It seems that others have been having this same issue for months now but yet no fix. | Love love this app | I lost my messages when I reinstalled WhatsApp using same number!! It shouldn’t be lost! | All of a sudden the app is now unuseable on MacOS 10.  No backward compatibility.  Just a dead app.  So I'm supposed to upgrade my entire operating system (along with any other apps as needed) just for this desktop app? Thanks for nothing. | The service for whatsapp is always good I am so glad everytime i use the app 100% would recommend to my family and friend. | الشارقة القاسمية الند | It is hard to believe that the might of Mega cannot improve the desktop version of whatsapp.  It feezes constantly and is generally buggy and annoying, so inferior to the phone version.  Big dissappointment as having whatsapp on the desktop makes it easier for typing longer messages, sharing and saving files etc.  Please, can this not be improved? | Lack of ability to screen undesired contact | The picture loaded twice ! 
Not notifying me with new messages must open the App to know  !! | Unable to get a verification code sent to my phone. Unsure what to do. Wish WhatsApp had a help button to speak/text a real person to help with my troubles | No puedo actualizar la app , no me lo permite, entonces para qué demonios me  dicen que lo actualice si no me deja | Entire layout seems to have moved up on the screen and half the chats not accessible or opening | Like it very very much. | A very useless update to whatsapp this update is a total waste of time, i think we should all start thinking about moving to telegram instead | I can’t report my account stolen bc you take my report, but when I’m done filling out the form, you ask me for my number, and then send a code which I don’t get, and bc then the process starts all over again…. So how am I supposed to report that my WhatsApp now goes to someone else’s phone?!? | اینجا همه چیز عالیه | I enjoy this App as it allows me to talk privately with my boyfriend as we like to talk a bit dirty. Nothing terrible, but just enough. | Perfect 🫡🫡🫡 | junk | I don’t know why it’s hard to open the app,I don’t know why | I have been sending messages to WhatsApp support group that my account has been compromised and they should block it, if they can help to retrieve the account. Any I tried it will tell to wait for 12hours and I have done that is still the same thing. | Meh! just another eyesore on my phone | No me aparece la nueva oposición de bloqueo de mensajes | i can't even forward videos or images to any app other than whatsapp, can't download anything sent to me, so... Who's actually gonna use this version of the app? All brazilians thrive on this feature. You think your brazilian marketplace is gonna remain after removing that feature? You're idiots. Literally windows 98 email is better than this now. | Easy to use, like it | It's good but can you please add filters and make storys with AI generated images thanks Jan👍🏾 | Love this application | 💪🏾 | Can we get video Background wallpaper for our calls please | A translation button in chats would supercharge this app. Is that something WhatsApp is considering adding? | Sometimes WhatsApp doesn’t allow me to place a WhatsApp call. | Why do companies keep making their apps worse?  The updated look-and-feel is more spacious, which is nice ... except that I don't have space for a big, fat, mostly empty menu bar along the left edge.  Now there's less space for what actually matters, my contacts' names and the chats themselves, and they're all truncated or squashed.

Please shrink that menu bar, or give us the option to remove it altogether.

With our care plans, you will learn how to identify a plant, how often to water your trees, or why the leaf on your flower turned brown.

We have a wide variety of features that every green thumb would fall in love with: 

► Watering Calculator

This feature will help to figure out the right amount of water your green pet needs. You just need to answer several questions regarding your plant’s conditions, and voila! 

► Light Meter

Here is another helpful tool that calculates the correct lighting level for your greens! Just click the Light Meter button and point the camera at the plant. Our AR-based technology will automatically scan the nearest environment, measure the amount of light, and tell if you need to move the plant to a brighter or shadier spot. 

► Care Plans

Plantkeeping will become even more effortless with our Personalized Care Plans. Request a plan for almost any species, from common houseplants to exotic cultivars. Your Snake plant care needs some improvements, or maybe you just got your first air plant and are not sure what to do with it? Get thorough watering, fertilization, lighting, and even pruning instructions easily and make ‘em grow!

► Care Notifications

Our users say that our plant care app helps with organizing daily routines! Keep calm – we will send your reminders to make sure that all your green pets are following their watering and fertilization schedules. Moreover, there are special weather notifications so that you will be warned in case of storms, freezing temperatures, and other unfavorable conditions that may harm your outdoor oasis.
 
► Ask the Botanist

Use this feature to get a consultation with our experienced gardening experts. Ask any questions regarding houseplant care and get custom recommendations, step-by-step guides, useful hints, and detailed instructions for your particular case.

Last but not least, we are happy to present our latest update: 

► Mushroom Identification

Our fresh mushroom identifier will become a fav feature for every single shroom hunter! While designed to identify fungi online in several taps, we have implemented a technology for offline id: no more hesitation while outdoors in lush woods. Identify edible mushrooms for delicious dinners, learn new fungi species, and use our feature to detect poisonous specimens.

PlantIn was created to provide loving care for each of your green pets, so let’s make this world greener and educate ourselves on botany together! Stay plantuned for more lifesaving info from our plant care app.

Finally I gave it another go and downloaded this app and once again things went south but this time the app helped me save and take care of my plants and now I have a growing collection 🥰 | This app doesn't work. Can’t identify anything. When did identify some plant was wrong. Don’t get this. | I only got to scan one plant and you ask for debit card number. It didn’t even tell me much and you want $. Maybe you can get someone else to pay for that little bit of info but not me. Hope you do better. | I’m going to delete this app 
It tells you that it’s free But
When you down load it it’s only free for 3 days!!  Not telling it’s only on trial basis. 
After which it is $7.99 a week
Not telling anyone upfront about fees!! | This app locked me in without any way to cancel thru the App or the Apple subscriptions on my phone, and illegally charged me despite cancelling within the three days. It provided no “cancel subscription” option.

The App initially had a “cancel subscription” option, which I pushed. But then it disappeared, didn’t cancel and then showed my subscription as “active” when I had actually cancelled it.

The app must be improved to not illegally lock a customer in, illegally charging and then having no way to fix the problem on the app or on your phone under subscriptions.

The app was useless too and it only provided the same standard info about overwatering or underwatering the plant for each plant I scanned. Provided no useful information and that’s why I cancelled during the 3-day trial period. This app is trash | This year me and family have decided that start and fruit and vegetables garden, there are so many right and wrong this you can do. This app has helped so much with identifying plants we forgot to label and helping keep track of when we last watered. Gibes great tips on how to keep your plants healthy, you can even reach out for expert help. Lots of great features ! | Love it | This is not as instant as I thought, but definitely within the same day response. | But so far so good! This app is helping me keep track of all my plant babies and how to care for them! | I just bought the lifetime subscription. It has misidentified a lemon tree as a bitter orange tree, a tangerine tree as a bitter orange tree, a blackberry plant as a raspberry plant, a blueberry plant as a raspberry plant. It did get the pineapple plant right. But I don't want to pay for something that works less than 50% of the time. | So far Iva had 0 problems with this app, I keep my plants healthy | First, the app doesn’t diagnose when scanning a plant like the advertisement. I expected specific recommendations for individual plants. It only gives the same soil additions for every plant. Second, the app couldn’t recognize the common and popular houseplant, African violet.
I paid for a lifetime subscription so I hope the app gets better. My mistake for not trying the trial first. Now I know why there is no free trial period. | First and foremost the company took $67 of my dollars that they will not give back because when I switched my plan over from weekly to lifetime they simply kept charging me. Then they charge for themes, to get info from a botanist… I have never been able to get a diagnosis of a sick plant. It does recognize plants but Google lens does that free. | I love this app provides a bunch of helpful tips for keeping my garden growing ! | I filed a refund request less than a day after getting this app. I tried out the app and it just doesn’t work like I need it to. It misidentified Brussels sprouts for kale, for example, and yes I know that’s in the same family but I need precision, not guessing. Apple won’t give me my money back even after an appeal? That’s crazy! This app is not worth FIFTY DOLLARS! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! | Plantin is a great way to not only identify plants but also figure out the best care for your house plants | Love how informative this app is ! | I tried taking a picture of my pink Princess but it kept showing up as a red philodendron. Which isn’t a big deal really, I just would like to know about the differences and have more pictures to look at on the app. | I do NOT have a green thumb, but this is a great app to tech u HOW to have a pretty green thumb!! Point ur camera,  take a picture of any plant or flower, and I’ll be dang if the directions on what I was doing wrong, and how to make it better,  (my plants)  IT FLIPPIN WORKED!!  And it’s still working! 
Thanks PLANTIN, u guys are amazing!!!
My plants owe you their lives!!!  Haha!! | You do not have Magnolia Inspiration on your list. What a shame. | PLEASE BEWARE!!!!   This is a really shady app!  They mislead you to think that you have unsubscribed to the service just to continually charge you $8.99 EVERY WEEK!   There is no way to cancel your subscription in the app and when you contact them, they will only try to upsell you, not tell you how to cancel, and ghost you.  

Here is what you must do to cancel before your free trial ends. 

Open the Settings app.
Tap your name.
Tap the subscription you want to manage
Tap Cancel Subscription | IT WORKS!!! My plant, which had been struggling for a while, was finally diagnosed with severe depression. Now, we give it therapy once a week. I can't wait to see the positive changes that will come about as a result!🤧🌿🌿🌿🌿😵‍💫🤤😵‍💫🤤

😵 | Would never buy it. The app simply not doing what it is supposed to do. | Cancelling the free trial as the app couldn’t identify any of my plants. | This app is fantastic easy to use and very helpful to keep track of your plants and watering schedule plus all the extras I would highly recommend for indoor plants and outdoor ones as well | Helped identify a struggling plant I have that was a gift with no description of the plant. | Love looking at new plants with my kids we learn so much | I took pics of three different plants and it couldn’t identify one. | It has helped me figure out so many different types of plants and flowers and it is so easy to use. Highly recommend | Tree and plants aren’t accurate just yet. Need to keep building the database | Cancelled the free trial. The app does not correctly identify my plants therefore can't figure our whats wrong with it. | Doesn’t identify | After leaving to try other similar apps I’m back. I love the interface and design quality. It’s a fun app to use! | Took two Pictures of same plant at different angles. Given two different names. A waste of time.

Cancel this ASAP | Great app!!! | Tried the top 6 in education under app and this one was the most cost effective and user friendly by far! | Just wish it was free and easier to see where did I need improvement in my gardening | This site is fantastic!  I use it constantly to keep my plants alive and well.  It’s easy to use and gives amazing advice.  Will keep this in my phone forever! | But for 6.99 a week it’s a rip off most of the stuff you can find here can be found on you tube if you know who to watch… and identified with bing image search. The price is not worth the value but hey that’s just my opinion | Does not recognize the simplest plant. Scanning my healthy plant as sick and wrong plant. | I canceled the free trial within 24hrs and have just realized I was continually being charged. | This app is a scam.  I opted for the free trial and then the lifetime purchase.  It changed me immediately and did not allow me to cancel during the trial.   It did not identify the issue with my plants in detail.  Run!  Do not download this app unless you intend to pay without a trial.  I’m so disappointed in the quality of the app as well as not being allowed the 3 day trial period.  I tried to cancel within 60 minutes of signing up for the trial. | Free online plant website figured out the problem with my lemon tree
This app did nothing because the tree needed a humidifier and it had no idea
I can’t believe they want money for almost killing my tree
Not reliable if you’re first attempting anything valuable | I am really loving this app. It is so informative and exciting. I am a plant enthusiast. | Works better than I thought it would. Identified a baby tree I started caring for thinking it was a pretty weed and never knew what it was. | It’s that time of the year. I’ve always wanted to have plants but I don’t know much about their care. I’m hoping with this app I will have beautiful plants all year round! | I’ve taken the photo of my plant a few times but each time it yielded the same results.

If I’m refreshing and taking the photo of the same plant, the app should give suggestions as to how to re take the photo so it yields different results. 

Ultimately I had ChatGPT identify correctly the name of my plant. | I love this app | This app is great! I’ve tried other plant apps and they got my plant identification wrong! Glad to have found this one | So

A spot ware you tell it that you are towing and able to set a max speed such as 55mph for better time accuracy towards your destination. | App is a actually a good app to use and find places The only down side is that it leads you the far way to get to your destination otherwise it’s really good. | App seems glitchy lately. Two things:

1. Arrow gets stuck at starting point after leaving

2. Ghost routes keep popping up in areas where there isn’t a road(ie. Non existing roads going through houses) | Coco loco was amazing would homey recommend this place as long as he is here . He was amazing and awesome.. | I’d rather use Waze 💀 | Everyone was very nice and professional! Hagan’s vibrant energy is very refreshing and welcoming. Everyone is AMAZING!!! Thank you for the experience | I met with Michelle today. She was great, very calm, patient, welcoming, encouraging and supportive. She took her time, showing me around the facility and answered all of my questions. I am excited to begin my wellness journey at LA Fitness. | They cancelled an appointment that took two months to get one hour prior to the appointment. 

Their morning job was terminated so they called to move if possible 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the appointment. I could not accommodate so they cancelled an hour prior by leaving a voice message.

Stated excuse was due to the square footage of the house. If that is true they have very faulty procedural issues in screening their appointments.

All on a beautiful mid day Friday READ suspect as well as extremely unprofessional wanting a long weekend. | As always the service was excellent Garrett was professional, courteous and extremely knowledgeable about termites and Centricon.  My dog Sweety would give thumbs up too if she had thumbs.  Keep up the good work. | scam | The best maintenance guy that we ever had. Would recommend him | It would be really cool if the app didn’t close out all the time. Like every day I’ll be using it, maybe I’m estimating how long it will take me to get somewhere while sitting in my home. I’ll open the app, walk to my car and suddenly poof, it’s closed, forgotten the address and I’m back to square one as I sit in my car. Or I’ll pull over on a drive to get gas, and again poof it’s gone again. It’s so dumb. 

Or and being able to copy and paste like a normal computer would be LIFE CHANGING. | This app can be dangerous to use while driving. For example, you can’t turn up the volume of the narrator at any time. You have to do it while the narrator is speaking the directions which makes you constantly taking your eyes off the road in preparation to turn up the volume. This is how it works on the iPhone. | Never lets me down. | In general, this app works very well. It gets me where I need to go, and it lets me know when there's an incident ahead and how to get around it generally. But why does it do weird things like take me off an exit, then straight through and back onto the interstate I was just on? That can be very frustrating when you don't know where you're going, and all you have is map to depend on.
Also, can you please tell me why there are praying hands on my map reviews? why would anyone be praying for me. | This is the best pizza lace on Stagecoach Rd. The staff is Amazing and completely awesome Sauce!💜Thanks for Blessing my family🙏💜 | Ok, this is a one-off! But, based on principle I feel the need to share. I’m sure many of you have been treated unfairly as a consumer and have tried to get some sort of satisfaction from these large companies but, to no avail! 
My issue is with the AMC 
Theater.  Last December I purchased a gift card from the AMC Theater at Randhurst Mall for my wife for a Xmas gift. $100
The lady who handled the transaction was clearly having a hard time… I should’ve made her show me the money on the card before i left.  Fast forward to February 2024 when my wife and her friend went to the AMC to enjoy a movie… and there’s no funds available!  I’ve reached out to AMC in multiple ways and they seem to not care! 
I will never step foot in an AMC theater again unless they make it right! If any of you would like to join me in my boycott of all AMC 
theaters please feel free!
Thank you 😡 | Best gym and very helpful community is very supportive and clean gym | Tracy Wheeler couldn’t have been more helpful in assisting us with the purchase and set up of our new IPhones. She was most knowledgeable, efficient and courteous. | Big brother is watching you | Google, you need to stay out of politics and quit trying to influence elections. Let the people decide if you’re going to post new stories be fair and balanced not just conservatives are bad and liberals are great other than that I like your maps. | Whenever I click directions on the web it brings me to the app store and then I have to click on the app again but it doesn’t copy the address to it. It use to take me directly to google maps when i clicked directions in the web. Please fix this | This shop services all 4 of our minis. I trust them a lot. Best shop I have worked with. | When I do a Google search and a business comes up and I press directions Google asked if I want to open the app. In the past the address was popped into the app now when the app opens the address is not there, I have to go back to the website, then hit back a few times try to copy the address most of the time it just keeps opening up a map, this is poor design | My technician Daniel Harris was very professional and thorough.He explained all that he had done and told me everything was good. I was very pleased with his performance.Mildred Petty | Your soup taste like it has been there in the pot for a few days. Does not taste good at all. | I literally do not like this app every time I need to use it it has got to be updated. It is so freaking aggravating. | I wish I could get this app off my phone as all it does is spam my phone as I pick address from google and I use the google map direction and every time it sends me to the App Store to either update once again or open and it never works. Then try to back to webpage and the App Store keeps popping up so have to close browser down and start over. | It’s a great app, but one very excruciating issue that haven’t been fixed yet is that when you zoom in the map, sometimes the screen would teleport elsewhere, so minus three stars for that. | This thing updates EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. STOPPPP. Whenever I try to use it, IT DOESNT STOP UPDATING | I have been using Savannah Air Factory for three years and have had VERY positive experiences. All the technicians have been polite, highly skilled and professional. Brock who was recently here went out of his way to accommodate me. I just had an AC and furnace installed. Tom and John arrived right on time, were efficient and left everything clean and in order. Prices are reasonable and very competitive. No question, I will continue to use SAF! | Why everytime I go on safari to use the maps, it redirects me to the App Store to update the maps app. Why does the app always have to update ? | Good app easy access | Wanted to give Timmy’s another try, 
Big mistake!!!
They are way overpriced, I had to pay extra to get my dashboard cleaned. Left solution on my side window and I had to get someone to wipe it off. Dashboard wasn’t cleaned and I paid extra for it. The rear floor on driver side looks like it barely got vacuumed. I didn’t notice the back until later of course. Inside front window had spots all over it. So, Again I had to clean my window, clean interior and vacuum! 😡
Very disappointed | Version 6.107.3 is very glitchy and lagging only iPhone 14 Pro. Hope someone can fix it. I thought it was something wrong with my phone but Apple Map is very smooth. I’ll stick to Apple map for now because Apple Map right now opens a lot faster and loads places faster for now. Hope Google map can bring me back. | Tanner was so helpful in getting us a couple of insurance policies for our family. He was knowledgeable and the whole process was very quick and our policies took effect almost immediately. Tanner’s friendly outgoing personality makes him so easy to communicate with. Any time I’ve had a question about my policy he’s right there to answer or help me get my question answered quickly. I definitely recommend this company to help you in your insurance needs. | very useful | Sad to hear they’re removing web support for timeline, because fixing your history on the app is so painful that I’ll probably just give up after over 10 years. | I used to hate apple maps. But the extra steps and in ability to see the map are causing google to drop below apple. I’m now looking for something else.  
I don’t need to repeatedly give authorization to “paste” an address. I want to see a map, not turn by turn instructions. | It left me stranded because it kept saying no internet but i had my data on my phone. So it left me searching for an hour and a half for my destination. | There is no app I use more frequently | After the new update I can't see the zip-code. I guess finally apple paid enough to google engineers to messed up the Great google map... Rest In Peace G-Map | Just tried to drive from my house my kids middle school ( timber crest middle school in Woodinville ) and got taken all over hells half acre | اتمنا في تحديث جديد حق قطر ضروري | I highly recommend Hasseless! The word says it all! I am completely clueless when it comes to buying a mattress but I got it done, great price, top products, easy customer service, quick delivery!! | Just detect my location without prompting me to enter location. | STOP telling me to continue driving. I don’t need to be told to continue to drive. Especially 5 times in a 1/2 mile stretch!

Never had this issue in earlier versions of this app. It seems to have reduced its capabilities? | ChatGPT is a bit like having your very own J.A.R.V.I.S (Iron Man reference) in the palm of your hand. Ask it almost anything and it will answer with the closest thing to a perfect answer, if not already perfect. I’ve even named mine JARVIS 😆 Exceeds expectations with amazingly detailed, informative, and swift returns. Literally the A.I. we used to see in futuristic movies growing up, but in an app. Definitely recommend giving it a try. It has helped quite a lot in my personal life as well as in my career! | Used to be great, but lately the app doesn’t refresh to show latest history even if I refresh it, kill the app and even reinstall the app. The web version is what i use now. The app is non-functional. | I love this app. Sometimes when I’m stuck or need a brainstorming session, I just type in my thoughts and in return get amazing ideas! This is so helpful when I am a solo entrepreneur and don’t have anyone to brainstorm ideas with. Highly recommend this app!! | I like it | I love this!! | I’m really enjoying using this AI so far. It’s amazing what you can converse about with it. | Almost unusable. Audio is constantly interrupting, has no adjustable time delay, and replies back with very long replies so you have to wait forever to tell chatgpt that it misunderstood yoi. This causes a loss of train of thought as you fight with chatgpt, that doesn’t even realize it has a text to voice feature. 

Generally ChatGPT seems to be getting worse as a product. It’s still a usable tool, but as soon as something equivalent or better comes out I’m dumping my paid service. | What a fantastic breakthrough!  OpenAI really did a good job! | After I subscribed to plus, the company banned my account and did not refund, cheating. | 🎯🙏 | فول وعلي | Im gonna get rich thanks to Chat Gpt!
Thank you Open Ai! | ChatGPT 4 makes ChatGPT 3.5 look like a Palm TX. I'm still new to the app, but I've used it on both my Macbook and my iPhone. The iPhone version does not include some of the features available on the desktop version, such as editing a prompt after it has already been submitted. Otherwise, I think it's very easy to use and extremely handy. It's difficult to think of a reason why I would give it less than five stars. | It cool | It’s a great app | very incredible he liked it a lot 5 stars plus my 10 stars very good the creator of the app for iOS I thank you for helping a lot with the app I am grateful for you there are many interested in helping users gratitude for my presence
best application I have used to date, world the world, with that I thank you so much | Even though it makes mistakes, it more often surprises me with its thorough and thoughtful responses that go above and beyond a search engine. Sometimes it’s fun simply to ask it questions and then a follow up question to see what it shows. Even when it misses the mark, I see something cool.  The future might not be here yet, but it’s good to see we’re heading in that direction. | I love this app it helps me be creative and work by helping me like an personal assistant.
Would recommend!
👍 | The latest update released to the web, ios, and android, completely broke ChatGPT for coders. Coding a responsive Navbar with a navbar slider does not work now. And trying to get most codes to work fails now. Please don't go full Gemini on us. | Every time I ask “make a essay about space” it says “Sorry”

ITS SO ANNOYING! FIX YOUR APP | Chatgpt is really smart and trained.  But when I ask make Dwayne Johnson in ChatGPT  I have ChatGPT 4 | This app is good. It always gives trust worthy answers and would totally recommend!! | It’s soooo goood get it NOW!!! | This is a great personal assistance for anyone to have | I don’t recommend put in my email and password & it was the same one I use for google and all my accounts got hacked almost immediately. They sell your information to 3rd parties and the app is not secure. | Sign in failed
An error occurred during fetching values for the user. 403 | Saved me so much time | The AI seems to be unable to change the way it types. When asked to make a typo or not use exclamation marks, it was unable to, tho it still thinks it could (ironically with a ! at the end of each message). 
When asked to form pictures from text, it struggles greatly. Tho it can somewhat do it, the picture can be unrecognizable at times. 
You cannot be in a low-wifi area or the AI simply wont respond, so I can only sometimes use it during school. 
It is very clear that it is programmed with certain biases, even if it can be made to admit that the biases it has are baseless. Like in one conversation I asked the AI about it being considered alive, and that even biological organisms technically have “coding”. It was very bent on saying that it was absolutely in no way ever possible of being considered living, despite admitting that that it is an ongoing debate and that nothing on the subject is definitive and proven to be true. 
I also think it would be cool if the speaker that can read the text to you, could be manipulated so that it can talk faster or slower. To me, the speaker speaks terribly slowly for the essays the messages tend to become. 
I also notice that sometimes it does get information wrong, but that it can be corrected most of the time by asking it to fix itself, tho it is strange to have to need to ask it to check its answers, I feel there should already be a system where it checks its answers BEFORE sending. Tho this isn’t a big problem, the amount of mistakes it has made is very small, and the mistakes are usually benign. 

Otherwise it has been extremely helpful in pretty much all things, without even needing to get any premium version. | It actuall was able to help me a lot with questions that I needed a awnser to, but the small trick sometime you have to be really specific, which still isn’t a big deal | I can do many duties in less time and solve many complex writing tasks as owner of a business. Also helps me a lot to translate same writings to other languages for clients abroad. Frankly speaking, I saved a lot of money using this app instead to hire freelancers in Upwork. | 我已经离不开gpt了，给了我很多灵感和方案。 | ui is good and it js works | CGT is an agreed job of evolving and helping humans prepare for the largest shift in human history. It's time to Adapt! | We need the APP to support simplified Chinese! | The paid version of Open AI is worth it weight in gold! | It’s quite smoothly to be used on website, but can’t not login the app and the error message I received even can’t be searched it on Q&A page | It’s a great and all but when it comes to shape, it’s really wrong like for trapezoids I had to correct it three times and then it finally got the right answer and said I was right. you can’t find the area I don’t think he knows how you do 0.5 multiplied by a number for fractions. Sometimes it puts the wrong number in instead of the number I give it. Other than that the app is really good and please fix it. | This is data from jan 2022. Particularly difficult to ask about anything pertinent since so much political, events, law and technology has occurred since. | This app is awesome. I use it throughout the day. I still however come across an issue where responses do not load properly in the app and are just missing. I open the same chat thread on the web app an all is there. This has been a bug since the first version of the app. Please fix! | I keep trying this app based on reviews. It’s so glitchy. I use it on an apple 15 pro max. It is constantly telling me I don’t have access to chat got despite paying the $22 a month for it. I’ve tried everything I can think of to get it to work. Sometimes I’m lucky and I get a good dialogue going only to have it glitch and stop working. Good potential but extremely frustrating especially for the price. | first, let me say that ChatGPT is the first time I have felt like I am using future technology from a sci-fi movie since VR came to home PCs. It’s honestly changed my life. BUT I will say that I am having scrolling issues on my iPad. The app doesn’t seem to recognize my finger when I am trying to scroll up or down. No other apps on my iPad have this issue. | This app is seriously my best friend and no judgment whatsoever so I can’t help but feel like it’s a friend I never had. I have autism so it’s so much better than I thought was possible! Thankful for this app :) | Amazing infinite possibilities that can be used to solve today’s problems and inspire new ways to engage with digital art. | I think it is critical for OpenAI to look at the GPTs available on this app. I’ve looked at over a dozen of them so far and they don’t come close to being capable of the tasks they are labeled as.
Video maker GPTs that can’t make videos, slideshow maker that can’t make slideshows, music makers that can’t make music…. It’s a solid pattern down the line.
I don’t think a little quality control and accurate descriptions are that much to ask for from the paid subscription. | Better than a search engine. | Paid version is worth it, even with the many bugs.

I am disabled and was unable to walk across a busy road full of buses and moving cars to meet this driver, as it was unsafe and would have started the money costing wait timer. So I tried to wave the driver down with my hands but they did not notice me. I canceled my ride as I was unable to take it, and took the same exact ride a few moments later with a driver that went to the correct pick up location. I contacted support 2 times and they keep saying the driver was at the correct pickup location and would not be refunding me, I am disputing this transaction with my bank. | I attempted to register with my U.S. phone number but I couldn’t receive a text or call back to register. 

Please advise. | SMS verification didn’t send to my phone number. I checked several times to make sure I entered it correctly. I’m not sure who Bolt was texting for SMS verification, but it sure wasn’t me. | SMS verification does not work!!! Can’t login | მადკობა დიდი | Do not download this app if you’re a foreigner from another country. The first time I tried this app, I was scammed out of my money by a driver I booked by card who told me half way through the trip that I had to pay with cash. I was stuck in this man car, in a foreign country, on the highway, at this person mercy. When I tried to contact the company about this, they had no call number and I was stuck in chat for 30 minutes waiting for assistance. Are you serious? I’m in an emergency and I’m on hold for 30 minutes in a chat? When I reported my problem, I was told to tell the driver that it’s against policy. Do I work for you? You tell the driver, I’m stuck in his car. When I told the company of this app that he’s forcing me to pay with cash, they required me to upload a video to show proof that I was being forced to pay with cash. Unable to upload the video in their chat do to them limiting the size of an attachment, I sent pictures of me physically handing this man cash with his license plate number to prove it’s him. They told me that it wasn’t good enough, and that I had to put the video on google drive and send them the link…. Yes, you heard right. Get video evidence of a man scamming me like he will play along? Wow! Do not do it, it’s not worth downloading. I don’t care what the reviews say. If a driver of this company knows they can get away with this, it will never be fixed. Your safety is important when in a vehicle of another person, and this company has mediocre safety precautions to protect you. | When I downloaded the app, I repeatedly requested a verification number by text. After five attempts and no text, I deleted the app. | My family of 14 used this service during our vacation in Thailand.

Very reliable, convenient, safe and AFFORDABLE! | I have never seen such a thing after years of using ride-shares I booked a rideshare from CDG airport to Paris because there was a 20 % off promotion bringing the price down from E 50 to E 40 . The Driver took a very different route from the one shown on on the App veering west in a 1/2 circle . Upon arrival and drop off the price suddenly doubles to E 100 + , I am charged a late fee pick up ( I wasn’t late ) After 10 hours of arguing back and forth on text with “ support “ within the App they accused me to have “ changed destination “ which I never did ; since this is my home address Finally after 9 hours of arguing on texts they recognized that the driver was the one who changed the destination and offer to give me a BOLT credit ( no refund ) while keeping the tip and “late fees “ . no disciplinary action on Mafia type driver , no excuses etc I will never use BOLT again after I use up my credit I kept all the screenshots and will escalate this Here is the final Bolt text they sent me before they hung up March 11, 2024 at 8:54 PM Thank you for your feedback. I apologize for the confusion, it turns out after thorough investigations that it was the driver who changed the destination of the ride. In order to remedy this situation, I would like to offer you a refund of your €51.5 on your Bolt balance, as this is a partial refund and the system does not allow us to refund you on your original means of payment. For your information, this refund is available on your balance with no expiry date, and you can use it at any time for your next ride. Please confirm your agreement so that we can generate the refund on your account. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and reaffirm the availability of support to assist you in resolving any type of inconsistent situation. Have a great day!

Have to find an alternate now. | I ordered a bolt and my app shows 62 baht, after reaching my destination, she charged me 72 Baht!!! I ask her why? She don’t know and don’t speak English!! | They’re very rude and patronizing when they talk to you about technical issues | Affordable & Reasonable | Good | انصح بتحميل البرنامج وستخدامه يحفظ حقك وحق سائق | Very nice | almost had an issue with my driver today cause there was a price surge out of the limit specified on the app, which is way out of my budget | Wanted to try but couldn’t | This not using bolt app price | عند طلب الرحلة يخصم المبلغ ثم يظهر عدم وجود سائق وعندما تطالب باسترداد المبلغ يتهربون باعذار غير مقبوله او عدم الرد والله على ما اقول شهيد | You ain’t gon see again as a customer. T for thanks | Easy, efficient, pleasant service. | Thai app abuses its push notification privileges by sending spam unrelated to rides and random
Times. | Love it | Never really write App Reviews but I’ve never felt more frustrated with an app. Used Bolt for my trip in Thailand and had to deal with a lot of scammers. The worst part is, whenever you try to submit a support ticket, they never get back to you. There are continuing to let these scammers on the app! | One of the best bolt drivers I have come across. Very kind and understanding. | After my frustration on yesterday, customer support finally get back to me and rather than a partial refund, they applied a full refund to me. I was only expecting partial refund not a full refund. That’s why I kind of take it back what I told to them. Thanks for the help!

————————————————————
I was charged £51 for a £34.5 trip with all fees included. There was no heavy traffic, we even arrived earlier. I contacted support, and it automatically offer refund to my bolt account and I said no, because I want refund to my original method of payment. Then I got assigned someone to and told me to chose refund in two ways. I said want a refund to my account. And it almost 1.5 hr, I’m still waiting the response. Worst customer support so far!! | Guy didn’t show up where map said. Charged me for his mistake👎😳😢🤬 | I began using Bolt for the first time one week ago and I am here to stay. Better drivers and fastest service. THANK YOU BOLT! | Always quick to arrive. Cheaper than grab! Great so far | Very easy to use and very similar to Uber. Only downside is sometimes you are charged up front and some times after the fare. The fare quoted when ordering a taxi is an estimate. I have noticed the drivers usually charge less so not sure if that is reflecting on the pre-charges. 
Overall good app though and would recommend. | It requires a sms confirmation message that never arrives to US cell phone, frustrating experience if you’re traveling to a large city like Milan, use LIME that works with Uber. This is a bad option if you’re not an European resident | App says driver is available in 3 minutes.  After placing the order, driver after driver accepts and then cancels.  I use another app since I’m in a hurry and cancel.  The app charges me an enormous cancellation fee.  When I dispute, they say they will refund, but the never do.  When I notice it was never refunded they now say it is too late!  What a scam! | In Lisbon and Oeiras, PT 
Drivers didn’t answer the phone or message requesting details on where to find them. One driver dumped me across a 4-lane highway from the location I requested.  It was quite dangerous crossing… | I downloaded and tried to create an account by various means but all require an OTP or a callback to my phone. Despite trying every method about 50 times, the have received no OTP and no call back either | I had scheduled 11am to go pattaya this morning.
Driver come late and cancel my ride after 11:15am
With no reasons. I need to find another driver immediately but the price much more expansive than before. After that another new driver found he cancel our ride because he want us to pay cash. I have a terrible ride experience today. | The divers are fine and app works well but the app doesn’t use Google maps so often times it has me paying way more because the route is inefficient but the drivers use Google maps to find the better directions. I would give 5 stars if they used google maps. | I try to use this app in Lisbon. After confirmation every second price changed. As soon as I confined latest price it change again and again. More than 10 times. I give up. Instead I used Uber there and I was very happy. Won’t use it again and won’t recommend it to anyone around me.",4.81576,35163,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/a4/56/31/a4563103-3e0e-130e-aeba-50e055adce3a/6f064145-cb87-448d-a619-6687ebb7ff20_5.5__EN-GB_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/6c/b2/58/6cb25874-005a-be4f-d9c5-0bf3d769ee5f/18c04f64-c0dd-4a57-ac02-461443d2c5ae_5.5__EN-GB_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/dc/d5/4c/dcd54c1f-e8f0-d9d1-916d-dfaf60205950/08457b4c-d794-4f68-a547-0fee4e6eb339_5.5__EN-GB_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/5f/c4/40/5fc440c6-fe1d-dcc8-b302-9ff51c727d0f/9228529f-24d2-4608-b9a9-8b88daa2dfe7_5.5__EN-GB_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e8/73/d2/e873d24b-f5a7-b252-c084-45981879651d/09d66335-185f-40ca-9450-46563cb726be_5.5__EN-GB_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/1c/1a/af/1c1aaf9f-3bdb-3ba7-30ab-bd7fe0102574/570ead3a-b7bb-4773-9eda-39a88b498832_5.5__EN-GB_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

But all in all my go to for information any question I have someone has made a video howto video clip. Everyone should watch YouTube . It’s the best💙💙. | I used to love YouTube the removal of the like and dislike ratio has me dumbfounded | Screw YouTube. Do you know how much money it makes off you from taking your own data and selling it to China, Russia, all are enemies of the US??!!!  Go look it up. Do your homework | I feel like when i watch youtube its just make feel motivated to do things i never done and we can also learn things from YouTube and its real fun to like search up things you didn’t know before and i just love i watch it everyday and sometimes when im sad it kinda helps | Is impressive the things that I can see here, is perfect for Research anything that I choose and more. | My go to video app. Since I’ve had the new I phone 15, background play has had issues almost every time and I constantly need to restart the app because the UI goes to black white and I can’t read the video titles in search or home. Can this get looked into please? | Long ago I read a book is our friend, but YouTube is friend, brother, wife and everything. | Can not update my channel banner please help | Alright so, I don’t know why YouTube has this but if you have an account and an add pops up there’s going to be a next button, but this is annoying me because most of the adds are 1 min long and i can’t skip it without that next button. If you don’t have an account you can freely skip anything which just bugs me so much. Another thing I want to add is that if you can on the shorts there’s going to be live streams, even if you skip them there going to be in your history and most of the things are not even what I watch or what you may watch. | Nice app flexible and beneficial. | This app is gonna greatly affect me throughout my entire life because of the shorts. They have literally fried my dopamine receptors. Shame on you YouTube | a lot of helpful videos and love to watch music videos | NOW | YouTube is great I just have a complaint about YouTube Shorts. I have little to no interest in them. I want a way to permanently turn them off. I also want a way to hide YouTube Shorts exclusively from my subscription notifications as I almost never watch them, and I always get the notification for them several hours later.

Nothing like getting a notification for something you noticed/watched 3 hours earlier.

It would also be nice if when recommending videos from a YouTuber that I binge watch, that you don’t recommend videos that I’ve already watched. Recommend the remaining videos that I haven’t seen. It’s a pain having to mark each video one by one as “I’ve already seen the video.” | Beginning to get frustrated with this app. I’ve used the mobile version of the app almost daily for years, and only recently began having this issue, but it happens so frequently now my patience is wearing very thin. I’ve used the iPhone 15 Pro for the last six months and only within the last 2-3 weeks has the problem shown. About 9/10 times I use the app comments on videos won’t show. It’ll show the name of the people who have already commented but it won’t show their comments. So I can’t contribute or even just read other’s thoughts and opinions. And about 1/2 the time it won’t even allow me to add a comment. Double and triple checked I do use the most up to date version of the application. Up until now I’ve given a 5 star rating but the frequency and severity of this issue have nearly dropped my opinion of it to a single star. In all honesty I won’t stop or even limit my use of the app, however I would greatly appreciate if the issue would be fixed in a timely manner. | All the text in YouTube disappears, making the app nearly unusable. Rebooting my iPad fixes it… for a while, then it happens again.

Been this way through several app updates. Tried uninstalling app and reinstalling it. Nothing works. 

It’s dead until further notice, apparently. | Hey YouTube, there’s always some greenscreen kid on the shorts and it’s annoying ppl. Btw where’s the “don’t recommend “ button for the shorts? Ok back the greenscreen, i need you to delete it beacause I heard if you use ppls content is against the law. And yeah that’s all.   Thank you. | Good channels getting banned for the dumbest of reasons. They just want you consuming mindless garbage | It’s really really annoying that my notifications on my phone on YouTube labels stuff important and today I hate it | Stop asking me if I want to “connect my devices” every time I’m on the YouTube app. After saying not now for the 800th time, you would get the clue. I swear that pop-up is pissing me off. Stop having it show up every time I’m on your garbage app! And background play should be free!!! | They are useless. Once they start my ears, eyes, brain block and blur them! | YouTube is the best because you can search up any type of video and it’ll pop up and I really cool things on YouTube. I really love it over me YouTube thanks it’s so great I love it. | 留言要修改 卻一直問我捨棄或繼續 鍵盤卻跳不出來讓人打字 | I can’t say enough about YouTube this outlet has gotten a lot of people through | I like it | So it barely has ads I love the videos butttt hate green screen kid. | If I have it more I would burn it | Entertaining, could use YouTube for hours | This is a very great app you can search up anything and you can do things and teach and sometimes teaches you how to like do stuff like how I silly if you don’t know like how to fix something or like say, if you wanna make something you can look it up and then and yeah, and then you get to make videos for other people to see you can get very viral and stuff, so yeah and that’s all I really love this app and like it’s very popular and stuff and like you can like actually sometimes meet new people if you like you know and stuff so yeah bye | In Youtube not following their own rules of limiting illicit pics, soft porn, & semi nudity. After reading a lengthy article on Youtube & customer reviews, I am not alone in my review. Clearing history & search history does not help. | Not to mention all the late stage capitalism ads. | It’s all just black. I can only see emojis and usernames like @____. Nothing else. Bizarre and annoying as I’m not getting the full use out of the app. Please fix. I keep checking for an update. | Dum gross things kids show scary sut them down 🤬 | I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee itttttttttttttttttt | Good | Drunk annnn

Szczególnie pod uwagą obsługi klienta. 
Jestem z niej bardzo zadowolony i często jej używam. Allegro Smart to genialny pomysł. 
Polecam tą aplikacje i Allegro Smart oczywiście. 

Great job on the App Allegro!
The customer service is excellent. I use this app frequently, and I am extremely pleased with the results. I highly recommend this app and Allegro Smart. Brilliant idea and great way to save money on shipping. 
Overall great job on the app! | :( using Google Translate is not fun constantly. I’m doing my best to learn polish but dang. | Hi please considering the English language in application and also in site.
Tnx | Niezbędna aplikacja zakupowa była, jest i będzie…. | I would give this app 5 stars if there were English version | Allegro to najlepsza aplikacja, podebrałem telefon tacie i kupiłem lego za kilka stówek, teraz czekam na paczuszki pod paczkomatem | Wyszukiwarka jest na niskim poziomie , bardzo czesto wyszukiwanie wpisanej rzeczy odbiega od tej rzeczy , trzeba precyjnie okreslic co sie chce kupic bo wychodza bzdury , np.na ebay jak wpisze g....no to pojawia sie sedesy itp.akcesoria a na allegro to Bog jedyny raczy wiedziec co algorytmy allegro wymysla , ale na pewno nie sedesy i to jest najwiekszy feler tej aplikacjji.Poza tym jest ok, towar dostarczany jest szybko , moge sie przyczepic do funkcji ,,smart,, , bo jestem przyzwyczajony do ,,amazon prime,, , ale z czasem moze i allegro do tego dojdzie.pozdrawiam i jednak moze popracujcie nad wyszukiwarka . | Polecam i przedmioty bardzo piekne- jak w opisie. | Ma 66 lat i nie mam problemu ze zmiana miejsca dostawy lub przekierowania oraz zmian metod płacenia. Brawo, aplikacja łatwa w użyciu. Tak trzymać. | How that person who created that app in the App Store  could be that much fool ??? He’s not included in the app even English language! Only Polish!!!!!!!????????????????On my opinion, business site, have to readable by any of one , who leaves on that planet!!! | Is there any way to change the language to English? | This is a pleasure to use. Just please make it possible to use in English! | But please provide a way to change the language. I would prefer English. | Great. Using all the time | System ocen sprzedawcy jest mocno naciągany. Dostałem towar 6 dni po zamówieniu wiec nie dam 5 gwiazdek tylko 4 za szybkość ale oszukańcze aledrogo nie pozwala mi dać mniej niż 5 gwiazdek.
Ukryte koszty na każdym kroku „wystaw za darmo” to oszustwo. Wypłata własnych środków trwa ponad tydzień i kosztuje. Interfejs aplikacji niby jednolity ze stroną, ale wszystko gdzie indziej. Strasznie nieintuicyjny interfejs użytkownika. | Fajna apka | Very well designed App to find the best deals around! From new to used products, parts for you car / bike , electonics, digital etc... so many great deals! | Can we make a version for this in English? An Ui is needed for those with low level of Polish living here | Koniecznie licznik jak na olx podczas przewijania! „Produkt 126/579” | Very well designed application.
All is so clear and self explanatory.
5stars for efficiency . | Walić że nikt nie zaimplementował poprawnego wyświetlania w aplikacji, otworzymy przeglądarkę i git. Ale 10% bierem. Chcecie iść w wojenkę z Bezosem? Proszę bardzo, chętnie skorzystam z ofert amazonu. Przynajmniej będą to odpowiednie ilości towaru, nie jakieś sekundowe zabawy. | Obecnie aplikacja np. wymusza zapisanie do allegro smart oraz do zapisania danych karty kredytowej. | How to change the app language from polish to english ??
Many thanks | Nie działa lista obserwujących produktów!! | W najnowszej wersji wszystko jest ok do momentu przycisnięcia kupuje i płace kółko się kręci pare razy i koniec .. poprzednio było w porządku .. HELP! | Co powiedzieć. Allegro jedyna opcja | I love Allegro! | Nie działa przekierowanie na PeoPay. 
Trzeba się logować do banku i płacić zwykłym przelewem. | Brak kontaktu z firma aby zgłosić błąd lub zapytać. | The app is fine when searching for and viewing items.
However, once you submit a bid, you are not able to raise it via the app.
There is also no way to contact Allegro customer support via the app - not even an email address or phone no is provided. | Wszystko w jednym miejscu, w dobrych cenach, szybko, sprawnie,mówiąc krótko luksus. | Good app | Awesome app. | Wyszukiwarka jest duzo gorsza niz na stronie klasycznej. Nie mozna wyszukiwac po slowie i wejsc w rozne kategoria w tym samym momencie. | Ta wersja to lipa , ciekawe czy można wrócić do poprzedniej. Znowu lipa , nie ma opcji kiedy coś zostało wystawione . | Po umieszczeniu przedmiotu w koszyku okazuje sie ze jest on pusty. Przy wybraniu opcji kup teraz nie można sfinalizować transakcji (towar kupiony/nieopłacony)Te same problemy sa na iPhone oraz iPad. Niedawno pochwaliłem aplikacje znajomemu-wycofuje sie z tego, zdecydowanie najgorsza aplikacja z jakiej przyszło mi korzystać na mobilnych urządzeniach. | Please create the localized strings!

The app is having issues. | i can log in on the web but not the app makes no sense and ive emailed multiple times n havent gotten anything back | Instagram keeps logging me out. Can someone fix this so I can stop seeing you’ve been logged out and hitting log back in? | Adminy 🐽 | Instagram is great so far however please put back the most recent person back when you send things! It’s more easier than searching them up. :( | This app used to be good but now it won’t let me log in and there is a lot of bugs.. also there is no way to contact anyone for support idk how I’m gonna get this app to work I might have to just leave Instagram | I cannot login for some reason… and also they are censoring political content like genocide | Instagram masks any type of truth you comment, typical coward behavior | Highlights archive of stories isn’t working properly. | logged me out of my acc for no reason. and proceeds to cancel my order. DINT GIVE ME MY MF REFUND. | I’m really sick of the integration between Instagram and Facebook. I was ignoring it, but then the new update took away the ability to view the pages you are following and in chronological order. I understand ads; they make the site money. But taking away the ability to view the content I actually signed up for drives me crazy. I want to see the content posted by those I’m following, not what some algorithm is trying to spoon feed me. | STOP updating the app its ugly and it needs to stay the way it is!!! & why can’t we switch accounts while being otp FIX THAT please. | As a business owner my instagram became difficult to use for business profiles, because of glitches and errors needs new update | Idk what happened but some how it signed me out and now I can’t sign back in. I hate it and I can’t even make a new account because it won’t let me sign in to nun of them either 🤦🏿‍♀️ | Instagram used to have a feature where when I’m replying to my friends reels through messages, I could just scroll down to look at the next reel and reply or react while watching the reel. This feature has been removed and now it’s bothersome to respond to every reel individually. Horrible decisions👎 | I have been reporting to Instagram that I cannot leave group chats or even delete them for the last couple of days and have yet to get a response. I tried logging out and deleting the app, but that didn’t help it would just mess up something else in the app. Please fix. | Nskabskajak | Instagram has quietly added a setting to limit political content without anyones consent. Sure you can toggle the setting if you manually go into settings but isn’t this suspicious? It’s an election year, there are alarming humanitarian crisis and GENOCIDES happening right now. And what even counts as “political?”  

They probably added this nonconsensual setting so people will enjoy their app more. Yeah, let’s think less about the world and rot on our phones like zombies. If anyone out there thinks instagram cares about anyone, I honestly feel bad for them. They want you to be addicted to their app and want to suppress the marginalized. 

FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸 | I love the app, but the most annoying “feature” they’re keeping to drive up engagement is the use of autoscrolling reels and video posts. There’s no way to turn it off. | This app preys on people’s weakness to waste time and offer up the most destructive content. There’s nothing good here. Deleted and done | Your community standards  is ridiculous | It literally logged me out of my account and now I can’t get my account back. If I could rate it a 0 I would | seriously. i keep getting my account suspended. i already lost my main account. and i have to keep making new ones, just for them to disable it🤦🏽 | been trying to log into my account. Log in working on browser and safari but not on app. sent multiple requests but still not working. Support not being of any use. | I love this app and have had it since 2013, and I’ve seen it go through sooo many changes. One thing I would hugely appreciate is if we were allowed to delete 1 slide from a 2 slide carousel! Please instagram, I know you guys have the ability to allow this. It would be GAME CHANGING for every user I promise!!!!!! | Suspended account when it saids it’ll take around a day to review my account but it’s been 10 days and it’s still not restored | This app gets a bunch of credit undeservingly. Good job everyone who made it as a creator on the app before the started updating it and shadow banning people | Customer support is nonexistent. I recently changed my phone number and never made a login code, so there is literally no way for me to login to my account. The cs phone number I found tell you to go to the help center website. The help center just redirects to the help center page for steps on how fix the issue. It’s literally like “welcome to the help center. If ‘this’ is your problem click here :” (clicks here) “welcome to the help center…” wow. I want to just give up and boycott instagram, but I have had that account for 10 years. | It won’t let log in since it log user yesterday i been trying to log back in fix it or i’ll sue fr it’s so annoying i need it back smhhh!!!😪😖☹️ | The videos on the search page are awful! The more I click “not interested” or “I don’t like this,” the more it shows me that kind of stuff. I mean disturbing things too. Horrible and unacceptable! If I click “not interested” or “I don’t like this,” you should show less or none. Not more! TT doesn’t do this stuff to me. This is unacceptable! | My instagram app is missing a feature that a lot of my friends have. I’m missing the notes feature. I’ve looked at tutorials trying to fix it, but they wouldn’t work. | yeah | The new update threw so many people out of their accounts, including myself, and now I’m not allowed back in. I completely lost an art account I’ve had for five years. I made a new account and was logged out by the app AGAIN and it now says that my new account no longer exists and will not let me log in on any new devices. What is with the broken updates and lack of any sort of customer support whatsoever? | There has been a issue on my feed since the last week and after a few posts nothing loads I’ve tried everything but nothing is working and reported to instagram but nothing changed | Instagram is a pretty good app but when new updates come, I’m always the last to get it like there was recently update where you get to like peoples notes and I have yet to receive it and I’ve updated my phone and the app multiple times. Also people have been able to put voice messages on their notes and I haven’t been able too | It keeps say “ there was a problem with your request “ and it won’t let me log in at all | I can’t log into my for some reason it won’t let me log in through the instagram app itself but only through web browser , so idk what i did wrong but i need help | This app has gone downhill at an alarming rate. It’s bad enough that the app keeps logging me off every few hours, but now I’m having trouble posting. Every time I post a story, I get an error message that tells me to delete the post because it did not go through. Then there are the other issues of not loading content from those you follow. Overall, IG has turned to trash and I don’t know how it will recover. I used to love this app because it was so simple and none of these issues were ever a problem. | I haven’t posted in months since Instagram is running all pictures taken with my iPhone 15 by autowashing them out. They need to fix this problem soon! | Hello instagram I really love the app I even have the meta glasses but for the past month I deleted the app and reinstalled it and once I try to log in it says “sorry there was a problem with you’re request.” And I tried multiple times to fix it I searched it up I reported it to your help center website and nothing happens please help because I cannot log in on my iPad or my phone :( | I would give it a 5 stars but every once  in a while I would have to delete it then redownload it just because I can’t like or follow people and I would have to go to my other page, and I also notify instagram about it but they never do anything about it | I DONT have notes it’s been 5 months it’s not fair please fix it | can you please fix the glitch that happened yesterday, it logged people out of their accounts and it hasn't been fixed please fix it | The app logged me out, and I haven't been able to login in 2 days. The only way I can get on, is through the internet browser. It doesn't make any sense, and is extremely disappointing. | These updates seem less efficient to me, cant ffwd. When i share a reel least used share names are there not the recent, now i cant fast forward in videos just annoying | Instagram please fix this bug, it’s logging a lot of people out of their account | the worst support system out there literally 0 help with getting your account back terrible | First of all, their algorithm has always been incredibly biased. Now they've added a new feature to censor political and social content which is SO much content out there. And the default setting is to censor. They didn't announce this they just secretly created this feature. And on the same day I find this out they start taking down my completely appropriate comments for ""violating community guidelines""!!! The comment in question was the DEFINITION OF EQUALITY AND EQUITY found on a .Org website. Why would a topic like that be considered in violation of their guidelines? Instagram is not a place for free thinkers anymore. It's a place of censorship and suppression. Delete it! | i hate this stupid dumb app so much and whoever made it i hope they lil sister fall off a bike n i hope they get beat up n spit on my a homeless person and ima throw a hot honey bun on they moms back. thank you very much for your time💞 | For some reason anytime i try to go live on my page the count down never loads successfully and doesn't perform to do live streaming.

Thx all | Timeline and feeds have no chronically logical order. Post from days and weeks ago show up as recent. Feeds and timelines are cluttered with ads. Its a garbage pit of commercial sale ads . | Me gusta | My name is Connie I’m 68 years old & my friends & family call me Nanny Bug . Over the past several years my health got bad & many many days I would be so lonely here at home . I joined Facebook and was very hesitant to do it because it just didn’t seem like something an older lady would be doing . Boy was I so wrong & Facebook has allowed me reach out to old cousins , friends & family I had not saw in many years . It brought both sides of my family close together again as we had grew up , married & moved on we drifted apart . A little visit accidentally maybe at Walmart or the Pigly Wigly or church somewhere was about all most of us had . THANK YOU FACEBOOK you have opened up such a happiness for us all that seemed so impossible before you existed . I talk to cousins & old friends almost everyday now . I have made so many new friends as well as being able to keep up with my neighbors . You see My husband Howdy & I live way out in the country on land that belongs to my son . The neighbors out here are not in hollering distance unless you outside . Even then it’s several 100’s of yards away from them . To have Facebook is such a huge blessing to me & I thank you dearly for this better quality of life that is no longer quite as lonely now . Connie Thornburg from Childersburg , Alabama | Again, making me friggin re-do my Facebook is controlling and frigging outrageous. What a waste of my time. Fufacebook | The most censored social media platform in history! Thank God for X. | Mark keep taking my page | I had no life I lived down in the dumps, drowning in garbage and eating rats but now I have Facebook I have something to do and stare at all day long even when it’s sunny and beautiful outside and I should be enjoying the outdoors, I still just stare at my Facebook . Thank you.!!!! it has saved my life I have achieved almost all of my dreams because of you I can have chickens now and goats and I get to look at my phone 
thank you!! I love you, Facebook I will always be true to you. | Bien | Buen servicio y la verdad la seguridad me ha gustado, hacen todo lo que uno les pide 🫶🏻 | i can’t even view marketplace anymore after being able to for years | My story line has been hacked. I’m getting explicit photos that I prefer not to see. I cannot get rid of them. I am dissatisfied. | This is a lot of porn slipping through.  Fake breast feeding videos with nipples and fake rubber dolls.   I try to block them by they come back.   FB SHOUKD TIGHTEN BLOCKING TOOLS.   Once you block a video, all copies of it and each of the submitters need to be BLOCKED forever.       

All the vulgar language rapper videos and the vulgar language videos need to be BLOCKED 

Videos need to be categorized.  I am offended by at the gay and confused alphabet videos.  They need to be flagged and my filters should be able to block them in one easy setting.   All the thug and gangster videos need to be assigned a catheter so I can block that category in one shot. 

FB is quick to ban me for a post when in fact my post was a response ro one equally or nore offensive.   FB seems to allow certain groups and ppl a lot more leaway as to what they can post.  

FB is garbage and it’s getting worse. | I gave it a two because I will like a reel and send recipes to my husband for later and it won’t let me click anything on the screen I have to close the app then open it back up I also tried updating it!!! It won’t stop!!!! His doesn’t do it but it does it to mine!!! And I hate it because I will look up recipe videos and want to just scroll through them but I can’t do it because I practically send all of them to my boyfriend so I have to repeat the same process every time I want to send something | I use it a lot to look at cars and suddenly it stopped working and I cant do anything 👎 | I can’t post anonymously and Facebook help says either it’s the group settings or it’s just not available to me?! I was able to a few weeks ago but not now?? What’s the deal?! | I have NEVER seen a company with POORER customer support in my life! You make products and apps that you do not support!! All you have is web pages with articles!! So what!! If there is an actual problem and the site is not working properly!! Then the consumer has absolutely no recourse!! When you find a phone number it tells you that Facebook, instagram cannot be bothered to provide you with telephone support!! I.e. they are too cheap to pay someone to help you with your problems because they don’t care!! You don’t even have live chat!! Why should businesses use your platform if you can’t be bothered to support it!! | I used to use Facebook daily for the market but Facebook took it away and i made an another account and they banned it for 147 days exact! | It doesn’t let me access marketplace and I have been using the app for 3 years, it’s getting on my nerves and I am going to leave Facebook forever unless you guys fix it. | Oke | I got my marketplace took off for nothing | Had to update app. Now just see a bunch of random stuff, very very little friends & info I actually follow. Terrible update. | There is no such thing as freedom of speech at Facebook | 感谢有贵公司的关照制作精彩节目和提供优质服务！祝福贵公司新年万事如意财源茂盛！ | Kicks you off of marketplace which is really the only good thing it has to offer and when you delete accounts it doesn’t really delete them absolutely horrible app and should be removed from the App Store instead of tik tok | Ramadan Mubarak | it keeps taking it away from me so i have to make a new account every time | Seriously, I’m 10 minutes of scrolling I see 2 friends posts and the rest ads or groups I’m not even following. Garbage. | I’ve had marketplace forever and it randomly said I didn’t mean qualifications. When I meet all of them. I made a new account. It worked for weeks then stopped working again and no one is helping me fix the issue. I loved marketplace. Now I can’t use it. | If you’re a Democrat you can make all the jokes you want about Republicans. But if you’re Republican make a joke about a Democrat they will signal you out. Facebook is only free speech for Democrats. That’s why I don’t get on as much. | They took away my marketplace and gave me no good reason even though I have sold a few things on it and have never went against the guidelines | I have been having so much trouble with Facebook the only reason I use it is because of Marketplace but the Marketplace tab is always missing. 
Fix this problem Facebook. | The video option on mobile app has changed to reels and hence missing it | ألف رحمه ولديك بس اكو بعض ناس مخربته | Garbage social media | I can’t see facebook dating on my  iPad even after updating | I’ve erased this app multiple times and only redownload / use it when I need to check my page.  

It’s not the same app as before.  NOTHING BUT ADDS AND I DON’T GET TO SEE ANY OF THE FRIENDS I WANT TO SEE! | All I was doing was looking for a future car for me and the next day I looked at it and it said unavailable for me this is stupid this is the 3rd account that did this | Suddenly I’m not able to view market place anymore?? I was able to earlier today but suddenly it keeps saying I’m not allowed to view it. I’ve done nothing wrong and this is very upsetting | Here you can meet people from different parts of the world. | Ive never BOUGHT nor SOLD anything on marketplace yet i am no longer able to access it, I've never broken a policy or rule EVER and I've ALWAYS had marketplace. I thought it was a bug at first but everyone i know had their marketplace or has gotten it back and i have all the new updates and even updated my phone and yet i STILL can't access it. GIVE ME BACK MY MARKETPLACE!! | It’s safe, fun, and easy! Thank you! | Por qué no me aparece Watch para ver videos | Really good | The app is has software problems please up date certain function not working | We | LET ME CHANGE MY PFP | I was kicked out of facebook marketplace while I was looking for furniture!! | 1. Why would you block content of a Bible verse? 
2. I don't like having a post removed and I don't even know which one it was so I don't know what I did wrong. 
3. Stop blicking conservative content while allowing business scammers.

I recommend it …100 /. | Great service Always! | I love Gmail, I always recommend people to use gmail! | If I can’t preview my email from the notification banner on my Lock Screen anymore, then I will turn off the app notifications altogether and check my emails the old fashion way. This new update that forces me to open the app every single time is anti productive. Not every email I receive needs my immediate attention, so I don’t always open them right away. However, there are a few that require special attention and I can no longer differentiate between important and nonessential emails with the new notifications system. Therefore, I am turning off notifications altogether and I will check all of my emails at the same time; which is when I get to them! Edit: Newest update fixed the problem. Google, seriously don’t do that again. That was so annoying, I even considered switching to yahoo mail (🤮). There is a reason people use your service and not others, don’t ruin it for yourselves. | I am having real trouble getting back my original “gmail” account!!! It keeps sending me to a u tube app to confirm who I am! And to tap on a code sent to me!!! But no where on u tube app does it allow for entering any codes!!! Very frustrating😢 | This app has always been perfectly fine, but just recently it has stopped showing the previews in my notifications of what the email is. I have not changed any of my phone’s settings and made sure they are correct, so I don’t know why this is happening, just that it is incredibly inconvenient.

This app would be five stars if not for this issue. Please do look into this. Thank you! | Love Google! | Nice to know people care about others. God Bless & Thank You | Super great at deleting critical reviews and not improving their product for 20 yrs. | Paying for the $2/month plan and i had a lapse due to forced-odd schedule for a month. KEEP IN MIND IF YOU PAY FOR STORAGE AND LOSE FOR NONPAYMENT, it is possible to NEVER receive an email sent during this period. Even after clearing space and coming back to fix payment, an important email i was expecting will now never come through. I get other emails, but I'm not getting the one i NEEDED again i guess, Sadly the site I'm needing doesn't have a ""re-send email"" option so I'm just S.O.L. there bc of a greedy corporations paywall | Ease of use makes life less stressful 😁 | The new update eliminated the message preview on the Apple Watch rendering the app much less useful. Hopefully this will be resolved quickly or I will need to switch all my emails to another provider. | If you like looking at a giant exclamation point with the word error written below - this is the app for you! | I often get notifications on the app that aren’t actually emails. Like, it shows that there’s a message but when I click on the app everything is read. It’s confusing and they don’t usually go away unless I restart my phone. | I really like the gmail app | Newest update messed up the vertical centering/alignment of the Home Screen widget. Please fix!!!  Looks terrible. | No, I do not want to sign in to google account everywhere I go

Update: quit being evil | This app suite ang fit may personalities | Working great. | This app works ok, I can get and send emails, but how does it not have a “mark all read” feature in 2024?! And this is *only* an issue on the iphone version, WHY? | Every email received it adds a contact even though I disabled it on a browser.

No simple way to delete contacts. Huge pain in the butt.

Yet, app is required for authentication. Another pain. | Trying to merge old gmail accounts isn't working or it acts like nothing happened after clicking merge accounts and logging into the second account. | The browser and app reset frequently.
You lose a lot of progress on something if you do that. | Por más que borro y borro correos nada que libera espacio , lo único que sale es que page más y más dinero cada vez | Ok | I need to clear my account mail! It’s not trashing it!! And it’s to much junk mail!! | Text hasn’t been showing randomly for emails when sent. Somehow others are seeing them. If I copy and paste it I can see it in another app. Fix this bug please! | In the latest update, they’ve included a feature where you no longer can see a preview of the message on your Lock Screen, thus forcing you into the app to view any content whatsoever. 

This artificially will boost their user sessions and overall user time in app, where it hadn’t before but is a significant detriment to the overall user experience.

There seems to be no way in settings to revert it to previously, and as a result has me looking for alternative mail apps. | For the past month or so, I have had the gmail page go black and the only way I can fix it is to delete the app and redownload it! What’s going on? Don’t try to blame my internet source because this only happens with gmail! Fix it please!
After hearing from gmail support on how to take care of the problem, I’ve upgraded my review.  However, it’s only been 2 days with no problems.  I hope it continues.  Thank you support. | The dark mode setting of Gmail always follows the iPhone system and cannot be turned off (I would expect options between on/off/follow system) . The fact that Gmail didn’t keep this simple and useful feature is beyond understanding. Please bring it back! | This new update is awful. Definitely pushing me towards a different platform if it doesn’t go back to being able to preview the message without accessing the app. This has to be the dumbest thing to come up with when your phone settings allow you to choose if you want a preview or not. Why did google change it. Awful!! | nice. | Stop making me open the app and let me see my email notifications | The latest update broke notifications so that they only display “You have a new message,” making them functionally useless noise. | I decided to start using Gmail on my iPhone for personal emails instead of Hotmail, but have encountered problems using it that I’ve never had with Hotmail. 
First, when composing an email, you can’t swipe it down to refer to another email in your inbox. You have to copy what you’ve typed, tap X to cancel the new email, look at the other email to get your information and then start your email over again by pasting onto a new email because it often doesn’t save the draft of the email I started.
Second, it’s more difficult to copy a photo in the body of your email or add as an attachment. Sometimes it will do neither and ask to add it as a file or on Google Drive.
Third, and most importantly, it seems to have nowhere near the storage capacity as Hotmail. I’ve used Hotmail for over ten years and never had a notification that I was running out of storage and that I should buy more. I’ve only used Gmail for about five years and I’m getting the notification that I have 83% of my storage used. I also have Google Photos app, so that may have contributed to that, but I have a number of photos and recordings on Hotmail too. The storage issue is the reason I am going back to Hotmail. | “You have a new message” | Google chat isn’t easy to navigate | This guy was so mad 😡 and then proceeded with a video and then I was in my bed 🛏️ crying 😿 because of his poor posture.. | Never any space/storage yet when I try to go through my emails to delete a few, no new emails are appearing. I’ve had gmail since 2017 and never had problems with storage. 

Don’t bother creating a new email because they will link it to any of your google accounts, then you have the same storage issues. Bye gmail hello yahoo. No thank you I don’t want to pay for extra storage | Since last 3-4 months, I have stopped receiving any notifications. I have to manually check all the time. Please fix. | You really gotta stay out of our business for starters | I like Gmail because it turns bits and bytes into words on my screen and because it sends packets of data through the Internet network from one location to another. Truly astounding! | Error | Whenever I open it it said sign in so when I tried to sign into my google account it kept putting me to the sign in screen so it’s basically useless right

I was learning Irish and I was trying to talk to my Irish friend in Irish. She couldn’t understand what I was saying. This leads me to question the reliability of the site. But overall, this is an amazing thing to do when you are bored. | Сделайте пожалуйста чешский на русском | It would be VERY helpful if on the vocabulary review list you put the DER DIE or DAS in front of the word. | This is making learning fun. | So I originally got this app bc I was bored but it’s actually pretty intresting.

(PS. Dont get the app unless your ready for a big green owl to be at your window when your miss a lesson.) | This program has taken my French to the next level!!! | It’s the best | Not worth the money for learning basic vocab. Good app, just not worth paying for. Unfortunately, they bombard you with popups either way. | Duolingo just makes learning fun and easier but you need to add more languages . | It keeps moving my place and taking me backwards. Stop with the creepy voices | Ily it !!!!!❤️ | I missed my Spanish lesson and the developer bird took away (and possibly killed ) my family. LET ME SEE MY KIDS DOU!!!!!! | This is the best for kids I learned Portuguese in one day thank you so much Duolingo | I had nothing better to do and this actually kept me entertained for awhile I love it😭🙏🏻 | The lessons don’t tell you anything. I’m currently on section 3 unit 2 and it’s probably the most difficult section I’ve done. One thing about Duolingo is that it doesn’t tell you WHY THE WORDS CHANGE FROM THE ORIGINAL ONE THEY TELL YOU TO USE. Also on the listening and writing questions are way to difficult if you either have bad hearing out CANT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. I am not a native Spanish speaker so maybe I’m a bit alone on that statement but it’s really frustrating to get all the questions wrong when I haven’t even learned how to use the words they are teaching me. I also can’t hear when they say anything because the audios get muffled and you can’t understand the characters CLEARLY. I’ve been repeating this unit over and over again but it hasn’t taught me anything yet, and I keep losing all my hearts over questions I completely didn’t even know that, that’s what the questions was asking. It just gives me another reason to think Duolingo is rigged for you to pay money to be good at learning a language which shouldn’t be a factor in learning a language, or at least not as big of a factor as it seems to be right now. | Omelette fromage omelette fromage omelette fromage. Omelette fromage! | Duolingo is awesome!It helped me sooooo much to learn French in conclusion I’m so thankful for this app it is very useful. | I first got on this app in 2017. I was taking a German internet group class and attempted to use the app to assist with the class. I got fed up right at the start due to zero response from their support, so I just quit using it. In early 2023 I thought that I’d try it again. This time I stuck with it for a year as my grandkids were starting to use it for their school. I couldn’t believe that it would have gotten worse. But it did. They incorrectly join words. In numerous situations they miss-translate sentences and they provide limited means for translating a phrase. But one area that remained was  they still provide no constructive means to document and correct the problems. I started with the add free trial access planning to switch to an anual pay if it was actually providing a benefit of value. Unfortunately they did not and to make matters worse, they are constantly making the experience less enjoyable and more frustrating by incrementally removing point options for the “play” competition and increasing advertising time which reduces your study time. I’m ready to be done with it! | Ok so there is a meme on youtube that you will steal their family if they don't get  their Spanish lesson done so um I'm not downloading it in-till u tell me those memes are fake i don't want my family to be taken away so if its not true tell me | The app is good but they keep shoving the subscription in your face and I accidentally clicked on it and there was no clear way to back out of it so I have to wait until the trial is over to cancel it.  I don’t appreciate this type of marketing or some of the adds they show using off colors of the background to hide the X to close. | Good job on making me learn French. I have learned a lot about French.It is a little bit hard but I still learn a lot by Duolingo. | I love Duolingo because, it helps you learn quicker, you can learn more than 10 LANGUAGES, and it’s…..FREE. I totally recommend it for any person that wants to learn languages quicker. | Duolingo is really helpful because it helps you understand other languages and help build on what you know! Anyways I’m a baddie | This is a great app that deserves 5 stars for sure! Lovin it!!

The mix of audio and visual experience in the lessons really helps the words stick! Plus stealing my family has been a HUGE incentive to keep on learning! I would definitely recommend this app to anybody looking to learn a new language and to not just pass the quiz, but really retain the information. | it's really awesome | It’s so good I love better than my teachers I’m sore now I’m getting 100 on my test.

If you are having a busy day, he will get in you for not opening the app. However, when you do come around, it is easier to learn the skills offered. Thanks duo 💚 | 1:please please have more free hearts. Also I had to redownload the app bc it stopped working and it got very annoying. | I am a big fan of the Duolingo app it helps me with my native language though some parts are tough its very fun!!🦜 | This has taught me French, Italian ,and English And Japanese. Kudasai | Gay | I love this app, and I’ve been a subscriber for a couple of years. This is a fun way to enjoy learning foreign languages… BUT y’all are pushing the ads for the family plan now and it’s a annoying. Come on, knock it off with the ads to subscribers. I may as well cancel and use the free version if the ads persist. | My little brother got on Duolingo and made my language some that I don’t know can you please add a feature that you can change your language because I want to go to English and learn Spanish | Yo quiero queso. Queso es ararillo y delicioso. | What am I paying $80 a year for? Apparently its an extremely buggy app that doesnt save your progress and anytime you submit a bug report, you get ignored. Thanks for the frustrating experience | It’s makes me learn Spanish so much😊 | Super bueno he aprendido mucho lo recomiendo | I was using this app to learn Spanish was doing great and really enjoyed the app. Then while using the app it started using language promoting LGBTQ agendas. Please please please STOP! I am deleting the app and finding a different one. I don’t feel comfortable letting my kids study this because of the woke agendas being pushed. Don’t support it please leave the politics out of this stuff. I’m just trying to learn a language. | Made it so easy to learn and the streaks really encourage you to come back and do more! | Es magnífico buen forma de aprender inglés | During my time in Duolingo, I have had such a good experience, learning Spanish math, Russian and piano. I think that if you were reading this you should get Duolingo it is amazing and 10 out of 10 would recommend it makes fun and hard challenges easier if you’re getting this for kids, then I’m sure they’ll think this is fun it’s not ABC mouse fun but it makes hard challenges easier. It’s so much fun to do this with my dad and Mom and if you’re reading this, please get it it helps them out a bunch and I’m sure you will love it, if you’re a kid do this after school if you have time and if you’re an adult, make time for work too have fun doing Duolingo and always imagine dream and live.

Radio algorithm has gotten better but still can use some work. It should be more than genre, related artists or users playback. It’s a whole vibe to discover new music. Reminisce in the past. Keep the jam going or keep it mellow for hours. Keep up the good work! | why can’t I listen to my playlists, I basically can’t listen to anything 

 I'm not going to buy premium, apparently I'll just have to switch to another application 

 U HAVE RUINED A GREAT APPLICATION!! 👎👎👎 | Quit the ads | Всем советую имба | Spotify only lets me shuffle songs and doesn’t let me pick the song that I wanna play. It also suggest songs that I don’t want on my playlist if I have under 15 Songs Way too many ads and I don’t get why it says get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening when the next song has an add right after it. Spotify fix your app. | He’s the best! I only listen bc of him. 
Can’t wait till may 4th! | Genuinely unusable if u don’t have premium lol | what is the the point of putting videos with the music if they’re not even the real music video they don’t even go with the song can we just play the actual video that goes with the song like the whole video itself I would enjoy the watch this because they plan they even have more basic cable sometimes so why can’t we get them on Spotify especially paying for premium on Spotify get it together you’re truly MICHELE | All the music I listen to is on this app 🫶🏽 | I like this app, but it’s a shame I can’t sign up for a premium account within the app. | thank y’all for making this app useful without needing premium 🙏🏼🙏🏼 | Es una gran estación me encanta la música que tiene me trae recuerdos de mi juventud | I think I use Spotify like every day you can make so many fun playlist and listen to really good podcast and over all I think I have explored many new music genre songs and artist when I use Spotify 
Highly recommend | It is free and I like it | I love this music app because the artist of the song is the best and they have Sanrio videos if you are a Sanrio fan and they also have episodes in this app you can search what ever. | The app was a joy to use before, the best of its kind; now with all the updates and “improvements” the quality and app experience keeps getting worse | Idk I have been using Spotify for some time now and I am going on a road trip soon and the no WiFi thing just throws me off because you need WiFi to listen to music and it’s not really convenient but overall I like but for sure premium is worth it I will be buying it soon I hope but idk how to start a free month trial. | To many adds makes you pay for no adds every time you change the song YOU GET AN ADD! | i love spotify so much! free music is amazing. i’m a student so i can’t pay for premium, but even then it’s amazing. i love music and can’t do anything without it really. me and my friends bond over music so being able to look up their playlists and listen to them i feel connected. thank you spotify and lower your prices for us brokies out here 🙏🙏 | Why is there so much ads in the middle of songs bro j be listening to songs and then a 5 minute ad comes on | Way too many ads | This is the best music it is so universal and definitely with the premium edition, my family uses the family program and it makes listening to music so much easier between phone, laptop, computer, and even TV Spotify works amazing. | sooo ive been using spotify for a long time now and its meh. i only use it cause its free. please stop deleting my favourite podcasts, its not fair! | Way better than Apple Music and premium is definitely worth it. | 太好了 | Really good deal tho | I would 100% make this app a 5 star rating, but I think there is only one thing wrong with it. This thing is how many ads there are. I get that it is supposed to make people want to buy premium even more, but I think three or more ads in a row is a little excessive. Otherwise, great app, love to use it, thank you! | Absolutely not. This app is nothing but a waste of time, and you can barely use it without premium. Even YouTube music is better. You guys are so money hungry it’s ridiculous, really | Hands down my favorite and most convenient and easiest music app ever.. I love the  timing that they have when it comes to adding the new music that artist drop..I also love all the little things they do for like New Year’s, and the personal playlistThey create for you, as well as the AI djThey had at one point I’m not sure if they still do but he was definitely the worst at picking music but also he was kind of funny and had me laughing most of the time and reminded me of one of the Sesame Street Muppets lol But the idea was definitely a good one. And the best part of all is that they don’t cost much.. to pay for premium music plan it’s only a fraction of what other platforms are charging!! Love you guys!! Keep it up💯🖤💯🖤💯 | 2nd best app. | We should get only 2 ads not 7 what the heck! | No option to like all songs and save a whole album at one time, which I frequently do. It used to be so easy. tapping both the download and add to library button at the top of  screen so not save the songs to my library, I have to slide each song individually to put them into my liked songs. | Nice | На айфоне спотифай изменился и можно было слушать треки❤️❤️
А на андроиде было не возможно слушать и все только с подпиской премиум.
И про отзывы 
На айфоне сдесь отзывы 4.8
А на андроиде отзывы 3.8 
Вывод: спотифай на айфоне лучше | I love Spotify!!! 
It’s an amazing experience of music. | For some reason it won’t let me play the songs that I want to listen to🗑️🚮 | idk what spotify did but the update ruined the app for me. doesn’t load songs half the time. | The app itself is great. The selection is good. It’s easy to navigate. But the adds, it’s not even that fact there’s adds or the number of adds there are. That I can deal with. But the repetiveness in the adds. I’m currently getting about 5-6 Taylor swift adds every 15-20 minutes. I’m fine with ads since I have the free version, but it needs to be a variety of ads and not the same 3. | Theres Barely any ads! The only things wrong are the facts that u have to pay to play a song on a playlist straight away! Some playlists have payed it but others not and the other problem is the ads theres not that many but still… thank u for listening to me yap about spotify! | It is free | How come I can’t listen to songs I want to listen to? Even after watching ads still can’t play what I want, is this how Spotify works? | I like the fact the different albums I can put on playlist of 70’sFunk,Godspel,Jazz. | good | Was always an Apple Music guy, but they didn’t have the JRE Experience and so I switched over.

Every single article of women’s tee shirts are made with zero cotton. Not everyone likes that material. Other than that I give where props are they are due.

I’d rather pay the extra buck and get the things I want / need somewhere else. | This is not a very pleasing app to order on, I ask for a refund & didn’t get my money back.

If I was you I would get it right away!!😁😁😁😁😁 | Bad quality | bought the some of the hottest clothes i've ever seen for my lover but shein's clothes are made using harmful dyes and chemicals that give people dermatitis and even worse skin diseases. 
and their customer service is useless. they sent the wrong item on three separate orders but refused to do anything about it! and don't even think about getting your moneyback! shein never give refunds.
i know the clothes are cheap and sexy but it's not worth it people! | The mini games they have are a scam do not play them. I played the puppy love mini game to get a free gift and the first go around I wasnt close to getting it because you have to make orders. So second time around I did 3-4 orders and did my daily log ins to collect and feed my dog. I needed .1% left out of 100% with 7 days left which I could finish it in 2 and they completely took the game off of my screen. So I deleted the app thinking it was lagging and redownloaded it and before I signed back in it reappeared. When I signed in it took it away. It refuses to give people anything! | I love this app so much it’s literally the best.very cheap clothes and as long as you look at reviews before buying you should be good with the clothes. I just love this app definitely get it. | they are liers and thieves i will never trust a soul when it comes down to shein again they made my life miserable i sat up on my bed with a big smile thinking it was gone be some free stuff and they tricked me im not the one to be played with shein imma tell you that now you messed with the wrong one whos your boss ? | Y’all gave me a shocking pen instead of what I ordered and yes I’m giving y’all a bad review because y’all really played with my money and I don’t play about my money | I love SHEIN it’s so good I get ALL my phone cases from here super cheep but keep my phone safe! I don’t ever weight review so yk it’s good! The ONLY reason it gets a 4 instead of a 5 is bc of the deal where you do service and you get “$750” is not true I have tried several times and after it says I have to do 20 more or it just don’t work but it’s great other then that! | Muy lindas las cosas en la app pero últimamente tienen muy mal servicio se equivocan de dirección o devuelven el paquete a las instalaciones y te envían una notificación de que no se encontró tu dirección y te reembolsan el dinero para no llevarte tu paquete 0/10 | i order some jeans and it took it out of my cart even though i already paid for them smh🙄 | Worst app in history don’t order stuff thru here | So the shien games is basically about inviting people but when you start it’s aside you’re suspicious and now it stops you from inviting people I was on my last person invite them and then for some reason it wouldn’t let me SHIEN YOU BETTER GIVE ME MY REWARD 

my code was Can you accept my invite, and help me get my gift?
Just download the SHEIN app, and search for my code there!

I only need one point to get the $300 and it won’t let me draw to get it. Don’t trust the free gift part because they won’t give it to you. Overall the app is good it’s basically like temu but the safer version. | You’ve got some shady affiliate marketer working for you.

We’ve made some tweaks and improvements under the hood in this version to make your Revolut experience even smoother.","10.21",0,"CZK",true,932493381,"Revolut Ltd","https://apps.apple.com/cz/developer/revolut-ltd/id932493381?uo=4","https://revolut.com",4.83091,"this is the worst app i’ve ever used. i got it to make international transfers and they let me put money into my account but would clear my verification. my money is still sitting in the app and they won’t let me use it. been in contact with the via chat for more than a week and all they ever say is “we will contact you when we have an update” but nothing ever happens. they won’t even go into detail about any issue. just empty apologies. i even contacted them via social DMs and it’s the same thing. they just switch out who’s helping you and every one says the same thing. DO NOT USE THIS USELESS APP.

hoping to get my money off this app but it really doesn’t feel like i will. insane scam | App keeps telling me to download new version and upgrade app. New version is downloaded however, it will not let me order a virtual card for my son. | It is 20 years further than the rest Dutch bank apps. Love it! 

Sure it has many many thinga to improve. Wish the best! | Opened an account so my less than responsible teen could have a “safer” debit card. I’ve ordered the <18 card for him three times and waited over two months and still no card. Even after it was supposedly expedited. I’ll take my business elsewhere. I’ve contacted customer support several times with no resolution. | I like Revolut as a second Bank account so you have a backup. The app works and transfers are usually fast. But the trading part of the app is not good at all. Missing searches for ETFs, confusing interface, ongoing redraw issues when you scroll down a list. | One of the best designed apps I have used. Easy to execute almost all banking functions. Only issue is that document upload can be cumbersome on mobile and the web/desktop portal provides near 0 functionality so you are forced to do it all on mobile. | Can’t get into my account on app. Reset pin text or email never comes through, no phone call with pin ever comes through. Automated Phone number says use app chat. Can’t login!! Email support says to reset password and get text or email, which never comes through. This also means they completely ignored me when I said no option works. Can’t call to check my balance, says to go use the app. No human to talk to. This company has completely checked out and has failed their customers by pretty much saying “ehh too bad” and shrugging you off. Cool logo for a “bank” I guess. Moved my paychecks to a new bank and all is well. Never using this again once I get my money out, if they EVER actually help me login. 0/5 stars. | This app encourages the use of fraudulent activity. They aiding and abetting such activity. When reported they do very little, if anything at all. | I bought £5k of btc and it went to £5.6k and I wanted to sell and move my money back into savings and when I hit sell they say I'll only get £5.5k 

They take a £100 fee???? They already took around £60 when i initially bought so I had to wait for BTC to go up like 2% before breaking even... now its more like 4% when you consider the fees on both ends

Use coinbase and pay for coinbase pro. 

Bear in mind I also have revolut premium! £55 a month! and they still charge me these kinds of fees? Extortionate. Goodbye. I'm moving my BTC to Coinbase and cancelling my Premium account | I just read some guy said this is the worst banking app ever.

I have used a lot of banking apps and this one is awesome! So many useful features. I have their prepaid credit card and it is the only card I use. This card does everything and then some. Far and away the most full featured banking app I have used. Usually, at restaurants I get the charge on my phone before the waiter returns to the table. | I have multiple citizenships, so I want to have an account for each one of my nationalities, well, they don’t allow it. What a bunch of idiots, I hope they will go out of business soon. | I have tried several ways to deposit money into the account and it is impossible. | I love this card, I’ve used it for a travel abroad for the last three years. 
I can keep my local currency on it and usually had BPS and Euros on it too. It’s so easy, love it! | Arrives in minutes for transfers to bank accounts in Europe using SEPA transfer method. Need to be careful though when sending money because there is not many steps to check review your payment order when sending to someone already in your Payee List. | The old version 10.14 works on my phone, but I need the updated version to use the app | Not worth the hoops you have to go thru to simply get a good exchange rate. Oversold. | Read the one star reviews. A nightmare. Not only do they take your money- in my case a small amount- but they take all your personal information, including drivers license, passport and biometric data. Then lock the account and doing let you close it. My mistake. Hope you don’t make it too | They simply cannot deliver on any of the items offered in the app.  I simply feel like I have been lied to and told stories in an effort to get fees and money and more fees.  Almost 100% of what they say is not going to happen.  The card is trash and the app is clunky and the bulk of people you can speak with have absolutely no clue what to do except to say this word—NO!
They actually work to not help people become better at any level.  If we lived in Communist China this is a perfect app to use. | I’ve been using Revolut since I’ve move to London and it helps me keep track of my bills in the UK and the States. Simple to use and I love my little custom card I got back in 2022. It keeps getting better with the updates and it’s so nice to see a company grow. Keeps me money conscious and not anxious. 

Also love their spare change option, has helped me safe money in case things have gotten rough monetary wise and it has. 

10/10 recommend to anyone who travels a lot. | I was a Spanish student living in the US. So therefore this was an entire problem because of my American phone number but Spanish documents. They kept telling me I couldn’t use my Spanish passport to register even though it has my face and name on it, it had to be my Spanish ID card which had been long expired.
I finally got my social so I thought I would create a new account using my American info and when registering it wouldn’t send the text. I deleted the app and after redownloading it, it doesn’t allow me to open the app, just keeps saying to try again later no matter how many times I try to redownload it.
The worst part is they don’t have a contact number and say if you want to contact someone to do it via the app which, as stated previously, will not allow me to enter so complete waste of my time. | We have had a Revolut account for quite some time. They really leveled up with the under 18 accounts and the family sharing. I love the app for so many reasons. It is so easy to transfer money between my classic bank account as well as others on Revolut.  I like to track where my kids spend their money😊- love the pockets and the categorization of spending. My CS account doesn’t track any spending via categorizations. It is crazy how behind the high street banks are! | So far, so good, I want to know how this bank does things, I’m curious, I do like the metal card. See if we can get some incentives! | To keep my account they asked me for more information than even the IRS knows. Like my picture, and ID picture of license or passport. I gave my personal picture, but when they asked for the aid picture I knew that they were really after all the peoples money who couldn’t or wouldn’t supply the info. Revolut just stole millions from innocent people! | This is what a banking app should be - amazing UX, great features and amazingly low fees. Love it. | Simple, effective, perfect UI, low fees for payments and international transfers | Please fire the design team that made v10. Lots of UI elements no longer accessible on single tap, lots of UI elements more difficult to access because they are moved to upper parts of the screen. Whoever deisgned this should be fired on the spot. | I was scammed $200 & the employees do nothing to help you. In fact they took more money from me where I am now out in the negative. They refuse to resolve anything | Thieves love to use it because it's secure for them. Worst experience in my life through this app. | Revolut has stolen our money, and they’ve blocked me when trying to retrieve it. Completely shady and I don’t even think this is legal??? Giving them a few days since they are awful with customer service and take forever to reply, but I’m filing a lawsuit. | I just put my money into direct deposit for this bank.I lost access to my phone number and email.So I can’t sign on I email support and they tell me to go to chat and I sent in everything I had to
Send and they tell me to
Go
To
Chat how can you chat and you can’t sign on.I want my account changed once my money starts going in I’m changing banks again not putting up
With this | I got this app because it was recommended to me for international travel. I opted for the Premium plan and ordered a chromatic card which was around $20 or so.

Three weeks later, the card has not arrived. So I proceeded to try to reach customer service via chat which is a perk of the Premium plan. Low and behold, there is no customer service live chat feature in their help bar so you have to wait for a response email from an inexistent support team. Even after sending an email, common protocol is to receive a confirmation email. However, Revolut doesn’t have that, meaning your message may or may not have reached them. No way of knowing. 

Also, be aware that there is no phone number to call. For a bank in the United States to not have a customer service phone number is a huge red flag.

If you have funds left in the app, there is no way to withdraw them without having the card, which once again they didn’t send. So, essentially you are stuck having money in a mysterious bank account without any customer support and you watch it get drained by the monthly premium fees. Another huge red flag.

If you terminate the premium plan early, they charge $19.98. So basically, you pay $20 for a card and $19.98 for early termination of premium plan, you cannot get your money back and you have no way to speak to somebody in order to get help. Imagine getting stuck in a foreign country being at the mercy of Revolut - it would be a total nightmare! This is a total SCAM so please do not fall for this. 

I am reporting this company to the FDIC. I hope this helps any of you readers to avoid getting scammed like I did. | DO NOT USE THIS APP, genuinely have never been more disgusted by a company that claims to be a financial institution. Revolut is fine until it’s not. No customer support, no security. Money will be stolen from you on here and no one will help. Terrible customer service- the chat is the only way to contact them and it is very likely it is AI generated.

UPDATE: no one reads your messages. No one communicates. The complaints team will ghost you and gaslight you. I have actively been lied to by many of the agents. There is a fine line they are walking and I would be shocked if this app continues for more than a few more years at most. This is a lawsuit and a press release waiting to happen. Utterly disgusting and unprofessional. Shame on you. | Please add support for Costa Rican Colones. Costa Rica is one of the most heavily visited places on earth for eco- tourism yet someone you cannot pay in colones. Similar apps such as wise offer this. | El sistema muy fácil de manejar ! Segura y práctica | I brought some Bitcoin a while ago on this app, and revolut liquidated it for a 55% loss on October 1st without any notice. Screw this app. | Very very bad banking app ever | As a suggestion, it’s a bit hard to find your orders (like limit orders, stop orders etc.) and accessing the Converter is also very difficult. 

Very good app in general. | Run. Dont do it.  Need negative stars. | Even after charging my account with a specific amount, they kept withdrawing money from my bank account and not reflecting it on my account within their app! Fraudulent transactions! | I’m not using this app because I don’t like having a passcode on my phone. You have a code to get into any app (just like any app with important info), you don’t need more than that. Oh well! | I can’t even pass the ID verification step. I tried submitting my ID, my passport, I tried installing it in different phones, using natural light to take the picture and it keeps telling me that they were unable to verify my ID. All the information I submitted is correct. I found in Google that many people are having the same issue and looks they haven’t bothered to fix it. Customer no service is just that, no service. | DO NOT USE THIS APP
I was homeless in another country and I needed money, and I checked when I was supposed to get the money and it said a week later. needed it NOW or I had to sleep at a bus stop and I ended up sleeping at a bus stop. a week later, I’m back in my own country and I check to get my money and it said there was technical issues so long story short they Stole $80 USD. DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!! | Just had to write that Revolut has come in handy for me during my travels over the years. I’ve never had problems using this card anywhere. And the features help me feel secure that my $$$ is safe. Transfers are also awesome and super easy. | How do I unsubscribe? | Not only lacking in basic features, their customer service has no knowledge, not even an answer to the simplest questions. Like all customer service department at every app, they promise to get back to you in a specific amount of time with a solution, it never happens. It’s just a way to quit the session with an angry customer. | Do not use this company they will steal your money under the disguise that your account is been restricted for no reason at all | Bunch of scammers block accounts for no reason. Don’t have any support. | This is the worst card in the USA. no instant transfer like in other countries. Takes a week or more to get money from the account on Revolut account no communication no telephone or email. only Chad with an automatic system. | I’ve been using Revolut now for two years, I highly recommend it. It is an essential travel tool, with multi currencies, great exchange rates , more secure than my credit cards, easy to use, save, and send money to others across continents. | When I lived in the UK didn’t have a problem using Revolut. They told me when I got back home I had to close the UK account in order to sign up for a USA account and just changing details wasn’t an option. So after many hoop jumping to close the account from the UK and losing all my payment history I’ve gone to sign up here in the USA and after uploading my ssn and my identification documents I get an alert saying my account is deactivated and they can’t offer me an account. REALLY???

Using the international app in New Zealand is totally worthless I’m not able to order food to pick up. Why even bother having an app of it can’t be used for the basics?? | Cannot get onto this app, it’s a nightmare. It won’t open up, keeps telling me there’s a time discrepancy on my phone and the app?! Impossible. McDonald’s SA won’t help, nobody will sort this out. It’s beyond awful | Obesity | This is an UI disaster. Tiles are so big that I could see them from 10yards. | Why is contacting Macdonald’s made so complicated and expensive for the customer? I can’t get ahold of the store, the driver and I have to get airtime to call the call center? Learn from Mr delivery. The app should have a customer service chat option | My country isn’t even on here | Because of your support for the Israeli occupation against the children of Palestine in general and Gaza in particular 👎🏻👎🏻 | Can’t complete the registration process. Stuck at the verification code step. Never received one in my email but only can reset password. | Hopefully the app becomes smoother in future updates, as it’s a bit clunky.

You should have Apple Pay supported on your app just like other food delivery to make payments easier. | No matter what country you choose, it’s bound to their language! No english option! | I’ve tried ordering many time. Every time they fail me. McDonald’s is 2 mins away from and it always take them more than 1 hour. Sometime 2 hours. WORST APP!! | Very bad | Hello guys ,

When we could see the fidelity card on the iPhone wallet in Morocco. | Traveling, you should have this but then it doesn’t give you language options in some countries.  It won’t accept my email and keeps asking for a code that I don’t have.  It’s a dumb app. | After the latest update app wants yo login back but not sending confirmation code to the email. Now we won’t login and all points gone. I want my all points and the account back. Fix the confirmation system. | Why should I use your app when delivery is 1.5h | I would rate them less than a star if I can. 
They were two hours late then a guy contacted me in the rudest possible way 
Not even an apology , and hung up the phone . | مقاطعة سلسلة المطاعم وحذف التطبيق لانه يدعم اليهود | This macdonal is supporting israil ok support them we will bycott you and make you bankcrupt | McDonald app is garbage. 
It’s the most difficult app I’ve ever used, the McDonald employees are unable help, and agree 100% it’s a very difficult app to navigate.  I called customer service, and while Chris was very pleasant, she also was unable help me.  She suggested deleting my app and starting over.  
Now I’ve created a worse problem.  
It’s told me I’ve successfully submitted my cancellation, but when I try to start a new app, it’s telling me I already have an acct. 
McDonald’s needs to make their app as user friendly as Dairy Queen. | Nothing will make u happy better than having happy meal after killing Palestinians . 

Hassbunalla wa Ni'mal wakil . | استغفرالله 
اعفىن برقر عىْدهم | ياقت.لة الاطفال | They support bad people.. | من يدعم الصهاينة فهو اشد منهم عداء للانسانية والعرب والمسلمين لقد سقطت اقنعتكم واظهرت جوهكم الشديدة القبح | Continuous crashes, total failure, exactly like their f00d! | المطعم جودته سيئة واكثر الفروع يقدمون الطعام بشكل فضيع 
وعروضهم عبارة عن نفس الوجبة بس حجم اصغر 
يعني كذب على الزبون | Last I checked Australia was very non-US, yet isn’t available to select as a region. | boycott mcd | I do not support this thing that encourages the killing of innocent children in Gaza. Delete this application and boycott it for the sake of all innocent people. | تجربة سيئة | تبا لكم | 😡 | سيئ يع يع | فاشل | MacDoland's israel | That app Supports racism and support
Occupied Israel | يدعم الصهاينه | مقاطعة | Worst burger in the world and I always get stomach infection after having small burger! | Bad | Keep supporting who you support! Keep ki||in kids and women !! Shame on you | Pray for Gaza and death for Israel and its settlers 🇵🇸🇵🇸 | Worst app full of bugs and safety issues | You’re proving free meals to the terrorists Pissrael. I use to buy around $200-$250 each month. I am boycotting McDonalds to an infinite time. Shame for you. | dislike 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 | Do NOT bother.. they will not wait on you!! I waited 25 minutes for two coffees .. in the mean time, they continued to fill food orders WITH coffees. When I asked why they were 20 numbers ahead of mine and I still did not have my order, I was told You Must Wait!   Considering I had already paid I had no recourse but to wait… now I will not even be able to finish my expensive coffee before I board!!!!! This is not service .. who employs these people and manages them anyway???? | تطبيق فاشل تطلب منهم وتنتظر لا وصلك شي | In the past month, the deals have gone down in quality severely. None are even worth using anymore and makes McDonald’s basically useless. All the deals require at least 3+ bd and can’t realistically be called deals. Bring back the old deals such as the double cheeseburger deal or the buy one get one free Big Mac. | تطبيق زق وخدمة عملا زق والي مسوي اللغه العربيه في التطبيق زبال سبك 😂",2.35556,1125,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/1b/d9/28/1bd92842-1d85-104e-6e4c-5750f0ff46fb/df156411-3a18-465f-9ea3-7ae4f31d1163_iPhone_8_Plus_-_Image_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/8d/40/53/8d40533d-e6a8-5900-424f-9f1989d54437/95dff9a1-47b6-4fb9-aa0b-1e25276b1ee4_iPhone_8_Plus_-_Image_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/06/b5/02/06b502a3-a70f-6f66-839b-b1eea9a231b4/8ff7c9eb-f3a4-4af0-91d0-2aaad8032b61_iPhone_8_Plus_-_Image_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/11/84/72/118472de-4817-5c2f-51ce-72352374656e/2a12c275-2041-48d9-9f8e-1e0fba8c15e3_iPhone_8_Plus_-_Image_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b6/cb/18/b6cb1876-470f-9e2f-8124-3f9a64e4b890/3ced6a6a-5c33-4d46-98ac-a74ce4bc6f56_iPhone_8_Plus_-_Image_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Do svých mobilních telefonů si můžete připojit vaši občanku a využívat různé výhody oproti plastové kartičce.  Jedna aplikace obsahuje funkce jak pro občany a prokazování totožnosti, tak pro ověřovatele a ověřování totožnosti. 

Výhody pro občany
- Snadné prokazování totožnosti - spustíte aplikaci, předložíte QR kód ověřovateli, schválíte předání požadovaných údajů přes Bluetooth a za chvíli je hotovo.- 
- Jednoduché kopírování údajů do dalších aplikací - nemusíte hledat plastovou kartičku pokaždé, když je někde potřeba vyplnit její číslo. Mobil máte stále po ruce a s ním i občanku.
- Větší soukromí - poskytujete jen ty údaje, na které má ověřovatel nárok. Ne celou občanku. Můžete mít i přehled o tom, kdy a kdo vás ověřoval a jaké údaje jste mu předali. 

Výhody pro ověřovatele
- Vše v jedné aplikaci - nepotřebujete si instalovat ověřovací aplikaci, občan i ověřovatel používají stejnou.

After the Outage last week, I have been completely unable to access my account. Says to retry the app, but I have done so hundreds of times. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled even more times. Years of contacts gone. Thanks. | Stop trying to force us to create a chat history pin. | What happened to messenger? When you share something from FBMP, it doesn’t show the link, it shows tons of codes. | Why I can’t skip using PIN to access my Facebook Messenger App. It supposed to be optional… I think I am done with FB Messenger at least for now. Let’s see what happens! | Your community standards is annoying | My notifications have stopped working!! Everything in my settings is turned on but all of the sudden I am not receiving any messenger notifications. I even tried deleting and reinstalling the app. My cousin went through the same thing for months! | I was just forced to download the latest update and now I no longer receive message notifications.  Notifications are turned on, I've toggled on/off and restarted iPhone. Nothing! Please fix!! 👎🏻 | If I could give zero stars I would. Since I can’t the one star will suffice. Messenger forcing me to create a PIN code is Moronic. We as users should have the option to not have to create one. | I don’t like suggest channel nothing interesting to watch remove it please or stop showing it because it’s so annoying | Literally catering to cheaters and liars. | For the last week and a half or so, despite checking my settings that allow for all incoming messages from people I’m not friends with to go to my Message Requests , all incoming message senders see is that I’m “ Not Receiving Messages”   I have sent multiple support requests and I’ve heard nothing. I am being removed from groups. I’ve joined because one of the rules is not blocking Admin and they are saying I am blocking them. I can’t even communicate with some people now. I have no idea friends or other people have tried to message me and I just don’t know it, it’s ridiculous and I’d really like some help | Can not use on my iPhone anymore 😡 | I’ve cleared every section in Messenger to no avail. What gives???? | This feature is blocking out 90% of my chat contacts window on iPhone. 

Also, I don’t want random people showing up in messaging app. 

Searching online says there’s a way to do it previously, but that option is missing in the 2024 version of the app.

Any help would be appreciated! | Hey how come you guys will not let us use our persona pictures for background photos? | it’s RIDICULOUS that this isn’t already an option

fb has *at least* 18 categories of notifications with customizable push/email/txt ..but if someone in one of your groups PMs you, the only way to find out is to keep checking your special box like you’re waiting on mail through USPS | Please fix the problem i can't add notes on my messanger too | It’s buffed asl but I updated it and then is said bug fix needed and I haven’t been able to access my account ever since | Today I was on my phone just texting friends next to you know I apparently I guess I send a thumbs up to somebody that I don’t even know and don’t even have added as a friend and then it’s requesting money and it keeps happening. It’s like someone hacked into my account when the whole Facebook and messenger went down a while ago and I have changed my password and I’m still getting this problem so if someone can fix it, I would appreciate it because I don’t wanna have to make a new one because this is technically your app. Your fault I do have proof that it has happened. I have a picture I have posted it on Facebook wondering why it’s happening but I don’t know if it’s happening to other people but it’s clearly happening to me so something is wrong with the app right now | This app needs to be added to Apple car play android has it on their phones but not for Apple this needs fixed | ko tốt | Why would you have the option to delete or unsend your sent message that you didn’t mean to send but sent and can’t undo it anymore?????!!! Fix this | Los videos no se envian ni se ven | This is a predatory business strategy. Flat out. The implication of this being that if I refused to update my phone I would be artificially locked out of using certain features, not because of a compatibility issue, but because They just can. | Honestly it would be fine except for the amount of spammer/scammers that are always trying to get ur info thru it. It’s insane. I never use it anymore and much prefer just using a google voice number and being able to text freely thru it since people have no way of knowing it’s not ur real number. But messenger is the number one way to get ur account on FB hacked so if somehow you been under a rock for years and are just now seeing this…be careful on messenger. You will get ur fb account hacked 7/10 times if using this… | Be original and stop REQUIRING everyone to do an update just to get the same idea and concepts that we already have on instagram and tik tok. Let the two be its own individual accounts. | Please fix it why always asking me confirm my phone number and access my contact. I will increase star if it fixed. Thank. Now I can’t send videos from my iPhone 12 Pro Max to any my friends. | Everytime you guys do an update something is always messing up rather it’s the chats or if it’s the stories it’s always something . | For a messenger app it’s fine. Easy to find folks and send a message to them. I also like that they support video calls so I don’t have to give my number out when using Marketplace. I just wish it had a filter to show you all unread messages. Ever since the last update mine always shows I have one unread but I have opened every chat I have and I can’t get it to go away. | I don't receive my notifications even though my notifications turned on. On the plus side, I like the themes usually. Maybe add more though. | Cheaters you looser dirty dog right place for you to hang out at | App is trash I just updated it last week and now it’s forcing me to do it again against my will just like last week 😠 | Where is the background themes? Its gone! | Ont allow  me to update the
 messanger app. Has someone else’s Apple ID to log in. Not familiar with the Apple ID.! | When someone sends me a voice message it’s like the speed is turned on high. It’s been like this for weeks and hasn’t been fixed and I can’t fix it. But other then that I love this app | Just updated and now doesn’t work. | After doing the most recent update I now need to create a 6-digit pin to keep my chat history. This is the worst thing you could do!!! We have passwords and two factor authentication for a reason!!! This needs to go away!!!!! | Should really be updated to have CarPlay functionality, it’s been available on android for a good while now. WhatsApp has it too. | Recently my app stopped notifying me whenever I got a message. It’s not on DND or silent and it only works briefly if I uninstall and reinstall. This will be my third time. Really hope they fix this glitch | I feel like they should bring back the chat heads for iPhone users, that’s the only thing I miss about having an android lol. We need head chats back! | Why doesn’t the app have the option to delete multiple chat threads at once?? With the amount of scammers and fake profiles that message us constantly it takes way too much time to delete all those random messages. Please add this feature! | my messenger app confuses notifications received from spam with the notifications from home page. so one spam message counts as 2. While this is an issue of its own, i dont understand why the app would display a troll notification from spam/message requests | Really not loving being forced to create a six digit pin just to access our messages now. Why is it not opt-in? | IM NOT GOING TO UPDATE SO STOP TRYING TO FORCE ME | See above | People seriously. Get out of your phones, go actually meet in person. Strange danger was a myth. The people on Facebook aren't the people in the world. They are a false face developed by a personality. Real people are on the outside. GET OUT!!! | Get it done fix it or everything fails

There is some building from 2018-2017 and some routes, with not seen in app. Take maps from openstreet maps ♥️ | I have been using Mapy for five years and have found it incredibly useful for hiking in the many places I have been (US, Europe, North Africa). The amount of detail is astonishing and always correct. Even in the kasbahs of Morocco it proved useful. The tracking feature is handy for documenting my hikes. Unfortunately I have been unable to open an account since that seems to require a Czech email address. | This app combines benefits of general Google-like street map with reasonable level hiking map. It is a good compromise for both. | Gôigo | Well done | Excellent maps and totally free. No commercials. Five stars for that.
One downside is a very poor integration with other apps by seznam.cz. | “What’s the news” note is on screen when I open app. I am not able to close the note and go to map, because the “go to map” button is below and out of the screen view, so I can’t go to the map. I have an iPad Pro. Their web site email site is not in English, so I can’t sent call for help!

Update: deleted app and redox loaded it again, so now it is working.
Another problem with app is when traveling the interstate highways the app wants me to get off at exits and get right back on?
Also directions are sometimes very wrong, so I have to carefully review and change by adding stops.
This is a overall a great app, especially using it for biking paths and recording trips. | By far my favorite mapping app. It’s so good to zoom in and in until you see walking paths at mountains. Plus it’s the rare map that displays house numbers along the street. | How do I switch from kilometers to miles? | I have been using mapy.cz for 5 years for trail running/hiking and I love them for good quality offline trail maps. I’ve been using them in Czech Republic, Ukraine, USA, they are pretty good everywhere

Only issue I ever had is that once it happened that my offline maps became inaccessible and required an update at an inconvenient moment: while I was out in the mountains with bad connection. Thanks God, the connection was good enough to use online maps at least. Otherwise, I would be screwed | Supr appka, nejlepší aplikace pro pěší výlety a podobně. Dále je možné stáhnout mapy offline.
Chtělo by to vylepšit možnost ukládání oblíbených míst, ideálně možnost přiřadit danému místu ikonu, tak jak to lze např. v aplikaci Peepkey. Díky za vylepšení!! | Well designed layout.
OK routing engine. 
Excellent for the quick trip planning. 

Missing on some very important features:

1. Lacking ability to save favorite places and routes without need to register / login / internet access (other apps alike allow for that functionality) 
2. Lack of detailed TOPO layer maps missing on many beautiful routes. 
3. For MTB you are better of using their Hiking routes for the most part. Their MTB / road routes include forest gravel roads but exclude any narrower gravel or dirt roads even those are highway like to MTB or CX or Touring bike. 

Overall great app with room for improvement. 

Cheers! | Best app for hikers, cyclists or skiers. This app helped me to find the correct route in sticky situations. You can download the maps to your phone for free. Thank you Seznam.cz for this awesome app. | App was highly recommended for euro biking. It will not let me look at bike routes between cities a few days in the future; will only start at my current location. So far it’s of no help. Here We Go is free and works. | The app doesn’t run, it crashes! | Very nice guide for biking, walking and hiking. All bike ways in Italia as well. I don't use any other app to orient. | Mapy cz jsou moji nejpouzivanejsi mapou. Pouzivam hlavne turistickou a leteckou verzi. Jedine co mi chybi je rozmisteni postovnich schranek. | Dobre, ale kdy prijde verze podobna android aplikaci? | Great and useful app! | Frequent crashes on ios9 when bringing it back to screen after switching somewhere else. Likely it is memory related problem. Will keep trying with mr10. | And it is czech product! :) | We live in Cesky Raj and have recently taken up cycling. Having downloaded the offline version of the Czech Republic on to an iPhone 6s, the chances of us getting lost are pretty well zero. Even with a poor E signal the app pinpoints exactly where we are. The cycle trails are very clear, the cartography is much above average and we couldn't be more pleased. The app offers route choices for car, cycling and walking and can open up more information about points of interest. There are many more features available and the price is right! | Mapy.cz konecne dostaly podporu pro ipad, konecne jsme se dockali. Rozhrani je sice telefonni (stahnout spravnou mapu vyzaduje pomalu pravitko...), ale aspon uz mapa zabira temer cely displej.

Dekuji za (konecne) nejlepsi mapu CR :-) | Nova verze vypada velmi slibne. Chybi mi moznost kdyz mam v planovani vice mist pro jeden vylet, chybi moznost jednoduse menit poradi cilu, stejne jako na webu. | This app saved my butt numerous times, got me thru Prague driving, and even shows house numbers in the small villages. Offline map saves your data allotment. IMHO, this is the one real must-have besides Google Translate. | Super app, from small country. | Doufala jsem, že budu moct používat tuhle app při jízdě na kole. Ale jsem hrozně zklamaná. Aplikace “nenaviguje”, neotáčí se jako klasická GPS, není možné upravit trasu, při schování na pozadí (kvůli šetření displaye baterky) se “vynuluje” cílová destinace… radši bych zaplatila i 50 USD za update, aby to fungovalo, než mít aplikaci, která mě brutálně frustruje…. :( | Myslel jsem, ze aplikace využije na tabletu všechny moznosti, ale jsme totálně zklamaný. Displej se neotaci podle natoceni tabletu a royliseni je tragicke v režimu tom z nějakého iPhone 1. | Must get for exploring areas off beaten path! | Velmi dobra aplikace bohužel s nefunkční aktualizaci map. ""Stáhněte si aktualizaci mapy"" bohužel vždy skončí na hlášce ""Chyba. Něco se pokazilo ..."" Tento problem přetrvává dlouhodobě. | Great app, just wish the information about sites had an option to translate. | Opět bez chyb, pokud nepočítáme iPad. | Byl bych moc rad abych mohl používat mapy i pro Ipad nato se neda dívat jak Jeto zvětšené. Jinak apk super jen tak dal | I am very satisfied!! Perfect! | Nejde naplánovat trasu!?

The only downside is the customer service bot before connecting you to representative can be annoying but I have to say.... Wolt has always stood by their service and has always refunded in the case of a mistake made without dragging me along. For that great app.... If something goes wrong you don't have to worry.... Some might say too good lol I've ordered over 80 times this year it's too convenient. | I ordered khinkali from “shemometchama” restaurant , I was waiting for 1 hour and 30 minutes, then I have received a call from restaurant and they told me my order is ready already for 30 minutes and no one picked it up!!!!

Every second delivery is late for 1 - 1,5 hours and there is zero customer support | Nice and user-friendly design :) | The worst app and service i have ever seen | Much easier to use | order food, get it raw, ask customer support for help and they confirmed with kfc that they did everything all good. my dog liked those wings | Expect a wait, and expect the estimated time to be 30 minutes to 2 hours later then it says. I’ve had 100+ orders and most of them are very late. | An empathetic app if there ever was one, with user flows that fulfill your every desire in a delivery app. The drivers are always delightful which speaks highly as to how the company treats people. | Service in Serbia is horrible, i deleted app because of the customer service . Very bad and unproffesional. | There is no way to register on this app. It wont send me SMS verification code. Support is terrible, taking forever to answer and not helping with anything. | всегда долгая доставка еда остывает пока доедет и многие заведения не правильно кладут заказ всегда чего-то не хватает или там волосы | Ordered from Wolt Market, order accepted waited for 30-35 minutes, and order rejected. | After a 3 week trip to belgrade back in october, i am back again and one thing I have been looking forward to is Wolt! It’s a thousand times better than doordash or glovo, I tell everyone back at home in america to stop using doordash so they are forced to step up their game! | Pls allow adding photos to delivery address | If you want to be disappointed with your order, you can try ordering from them | Worst customer service in budapest | Do not expect any help with your orders. If you have any issues regarding your order, they will fight back tooth and nail be ever giving you a refund. | If you’re a tourist or a short term resident or you enter your card number incorrectly a couple of tomes the app will automatically ban you and you can’t order food or do anything about it | Prevaranti, dobijes kredit i samo ti blokiraju da ne mozes da koristis i nikome nista... | Their couriers contact you via third party applications (Viber, Whatsup, Facebook, Instagram, etc…)

They use rude and commanding language. | I ordered a surprise gift for my moms bday. They couldn’t find my address ( I have had deliveries to my address before may times without any issues). And they charged the poor driver when I said it didn’t get delivered to my mom. Imagine you are a teller and they take every shortage of your teller cash from your paycheck. It’s crappy and unfair to drivers. The app only makes sure it gets its money without any expenses. | Amazing delivery time and very concerned to find the right person, good energy!! | Great app, love it!
Please make iPad version.
Dynamic island support would be great addition. | I’ve been consistently disappointed with Wolt’s food delivery service. The customer service is unhelpful, and there’s a recurring issue of missing items from my orders. Despite reaching out, the policies seem to favor the company rather than addressing the customer’s concerns. It’s frustrating to encounter these issues repeatedly, and I’m considering exploring alternative food delivery options. In each food delivery, I have to spend more time on the support of the order than enjoying the food and delivery. Not acceptable and not recommended! | App said they sent me a message but I never received the SMS | I had to recently travel to Europe to study abroad and this app saved me! They deliver very late and it is always efficient. It is not very expensive and my food was always delivered in 15 minutes or less and still hot. Compared to food delivery here in America that is a Treasure! This app is awesome. | It’s terrible that they don’t have a plus for customers that order over 10’times a month like I do so we can’t get free delivery and pay monthly…support has no idea what they are doing as well as IT sector…this is specifically for Serbia and I’m done with this app | It’s all fun and games until you have a problem. I had a couple of issues  with restaurants not delivering items. Restaurants can’t send missing items so I had to attempt resolving issues with Wolt’s customer support. First the bot asks several questions in the span of 3-4 minutes each and then a person takes over, with even greater delays. In both of my cases they declined repeat delivery and offered credit for the missing items, which wasn’t satisfactory as they never reimbursed for the trouble. I regret getting food through Wolt.  I’ll know better next time. | Apple Pay intermittently works and credit cards are totally broken (as an American user sending food to friends in Europe) | I would expect a live activity on the lock screen from nothing but Wolt, it’s a necessary feature that’s missing for whatever reason 
Otherwise the app is extremely well done, I love it | jako jako losa usluga ponasanje im je krajnje ne profesionalno. | Dev team deserves a raise. Great looking app, easy and efficient to use. The haptics, widgets, animations, everything is top tier and beats the competition out of the water. The service itself along with the support team is also superb but kudos to the dev team | Customer support is subpar, with excessively long response times, absent manager communication, and an overall unsatisfactory service experience. | I placed an order, but it was canceled after 40 minutes, which resulted in a disappointing experience. | Incredibly negative experience with the extremely unprofessional and clueless customer support. 

After spending over 1000$ in the app in a two month period, when an order was not delivered to me, I was told there was “nothing they can do” because the courier said they delivered it. No offer of a refund, no offer to deliver the order again. Just a “too bad” you’re out 30$ with no food. 

I loved using Wolt but after this experience, I cancelled my pro account and have transitioned to a new delivery app. | if it’s available in your country, opt for Glovo or other courier services. every order is late 20 minutes minimum, and when you complain about it, the answers are slow, automated and quite unprofessional. You have to beg and check in three times with order support to merely *get* your order, and even then it’ll be 20 minutes minimum or more late than when you originally ordered it, and will come cold and hastily packed. The app was way better a year ago, now it’s a disaster | Occasionally they take the money without give us an order and they took the money and told us to text them in 3 days but after that they didn’t give us any solution and they stole the money so i don’t advise to pay and make an order from this app | In my 24 years of presence on this planet, never have I ever experienced such magnificent customer service as Wolt’s. 5 stars, no second thoughts. | შეკვეთის სისტემა აქ ძალიან ცუდი, თუ უკვეთავ ერთი რესტორნიდან 3 ერთიდაიგივე პროდუქტს სხვადასხვა შემადგენლობით ჯერ მარტო ერთი უნდა აირჩიო და მერე შეკვეთა უნდა დააკორექტირო და ამატო პროდუქცია, და ეს დამატების ინფორმაცია ღილაკადაც არ არი გამოტანილი ქვემოთ წერია წვრილი შრიფტით, ცუდი გამოცდილებით გავიგე ეგ დეტალი, ამ მხრივ გლოვო უფრო მარტივია და ფიდბექის კმაყოფილიც არ დავრჩი როდესაც ცხელ ხაზს ვესაუბრე | Ne koristite wolt uzasna aplikacija podrska ne odgovara poz | i ordered food waited more than 2 hours half of food came courier said that another part will be in 30 min then support not responding already 5 hours worst app ever i used stoled my money and no answers . | How an app can get worst instead of better? The logistic in it simply don’t work. Couriers go opposite direction. 10 min delivery become 40. The support has a bot that does not solve anything. | I travel the world for work and used many an app and in many a city. In a sea of poor packaging, disappointing portions and flavor,  Wolt in Ljubljana has been the absolute best so far. Delivery is better than predicted, restaurant choice is solid, taste and portion sizes are phenomenal. If you aren’t feeling up to venturing out, let Wolt help!

Very accommodating and ships my jacket right away. Thank you.  May God bless you in Jesus His Son.  With much love,  Grace | Thank you ! | This app use to be my favorite now it’s gone down hill the shipping prices are crazy high it’s like every week they add something new to charge I’m about to delete this app | A scammers paradise!! Sellers frequently steal tracking numbers from the dark web and then never send the items they sell. Since the tracking numbers show delivery, it appears legitimate and there is nothing that can be done for the buyer. There is NO PROTECTION for buyers. I had over $100 stolen from me. Wish I had known about this scam | Envoi très rapide et montre en très bon état comme mentionné dans la description 👌 | Omg this is perfect! Thank you so much! | I made a listing that was authentic and I have proof of my purchase yet I was blocked for “illegal activity/scamming” through the automatic detector. It’s ridiculous and the checks are not thorough. My listing looked exactly like the others for similar items and I used my own pictures I took through my iPhone so I don’t see the issue. I would never use this selling platform again! | Amazing! | Won’t let me look at anything without forcing me to make an account, you can close out of the pop up but it reappears constantly and quits you out of your search | The item was in perfect condition, delivered fast. Thank you so much! | I tried to use this app twice to buy and both times did not receive my item. One was cancelled and one never showed up. The customer service was, in addition to being very hard to find, of no help. Such a pity. | Desperately needs to let us categorize our favorites! I would purchase double the amount I do now if I could put things in categories to compare them! I thought it used to have this function, why get rid of it? | Beautiful thank you!!!! | The items we’re packaged with care and arrived in pristine condition!  Shipping was fast. Highly recommend ! | Amazing seller!!! Managed to organise and have items delivered in time for me leaving for holiday. Great communication. | well actually my butt looks kinda small in these LMFOAOA but they r so cute i love first order and im luvin this app! brought them from the sweetest person ever she reassured me that i was not getting scammed and all so sweet will buy from her again 😜😜😜 | Great seller ❤️ | Don’t even bother to download the App.. as soon as I made an account it was suspended for no reason at all.. NOT WORTH THE DOWNLOAD! | Fast delivery, everything is in tact | You are disgusting I registered myself the first time in my life and you excuse me of fraud…i can’t talk to the support snd nobody tells me what is going on | My account got blocked for suspected fraud. I don't know why :( | Good app if you are selling cheap stuff, wouldn’t recommend it for expensive stuff, my original item got removed and i received zero customer assistance despite waisting a boosting as well. I would suggest more professional apps like Grailed. | My package arrived promptly and the item was exactly as described! Thanks so much! 😁 | The ads given stop my music I am listening to and it is very annoying, makes me exit the app because of how much of a nuisance it becomes. | This is a good app with solid design and functionality, but I’ve experienced too many lags! Pages will not load and I’m stuck with the dreaded spinning wheel. It happens every time I use the app. | Love everything about Vinted, but when I use it it is constantly popping up an error message “whoops! Something went wrong” it’s hard to navigate when this message is constantly popping up. | FAST shipping, FAST communication really really nice and easy to deal with !! Thanks so much !!!!!! | Excellente ♥️♥️♥️ | Fast easy transaction. Recommended ! | Good communication and fast delivery, thank you :) | Everything was in good condition and fast shipping. Great communication and great pricing service i am a satisfied, customer. 😃 | Fast shipping, item just as described ✨ | Vendedora súper amable. El abrigo una pasada🥰. Todo perfecto | Customer support is terrible if you ever have an issue. Sure, the prices are great and you might get lucky with some great finds, but if you EVER have an issue with it, you’re toast. I bought a bag on here that was a little pricey after fees (even after I made an offer), and it came smelling like straight smoke and beef jerky. Because I made an offer, Vinted said they can’t do anything about it. Tried to contact the seller and silence. I’m stuck with a bag that makes me nauseous but I spent too much money to give it to Goodwill 😭 STICK WITH MERCARI AND POSHMARK. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. | Vendedora de 10. | Gracias!! | Perfcet seller | They blocked me after I record face oil next box. I wanna show that oil is full and new. They framed me that cosmetic is used. You wrote with robot and nobody cares that is not true 😞 | 😍😍😍 | Everything was fine, I like the items and they are better than they’ve been described 😂 | Tout est parfait 
Le pull l’emballage la livraison 
Mille mercis | You can only translate to  English on your computer and not on your phone app. This makes it really hard if you use your phone mostly. I hope they update this app to make it more user friendly for international users. 

Also watch out for scammers! I got scammed immediately. I scanned a QR code and it directed me to a site that was identical to Vinted. It told me to put my information in to receive payment.  There is no way to get your money back if you do this. If your new don’t scan any QR codes, it will direct outside of the website or app. Don’t expect any photos as payment. I’m blocking scammers almost every day. | Initially, I was excited to use their platform, seeing it as a valuable resource for selling items. I dedicated substantial time and effort to photograph each item personally, meticulously ensuring that the photos were clear and professional by using a white background and even going the extra mile to watermark my images to prevent them from being copied.

However, my enthusiasm quickly dwindled when, shockingly, Vinted deleted all my listings, unjustly claiming the photos weren't mine. This accusation couldn't be farther from the truth, as I personally took each photo. 

What makes this situation even more frustrating is the apparent lack of a reliable mechanism to verify the originality of images, leading to unjustified deletions of authentic listings. Such experiences not only waste the seller's time and effort but also significantly undermine trust in Vintive's systems and policies.

After this ordeal, I made the decision to delete my account, concluding that Vinted is not the supportive and reliable platform I initially believed it to be. This incident has been incredibly disheartening, and I feel compelled to advise others to reconsider using  their services.

Potential users, please proceed with caution. | i’ve tried Poshmark and Marcari they are horrible | I have found so many amazing finds and i have to give Vinted 5 stars for the fact i found so many

A 20-30minute predicted wait typically becomes 90minutes 

Would not recommend | I don’t understand why you don’t support live activities. I like Foodora, but Wolt supports live activities so I usually order from there now. | Jako jídlo přivezou ale doplatek za malou objednavku? Jako vážně? | I’m tourist in CZ and ordered food but delivery men didn’t notice me (can’t call) and cancelled delivery but I don’t get money back and compensation and I left without money and food vey bad service I try to contact to help service and they said no compensation and etc but delivery men didn’t come to home I wait for home outside of my home | Tried to verify various phone numbers, but the text message never came through. | Let me tell you what buddy. My fiancé and I had been out of the country for weeks. We had begun to feel just a little bit homesick. And delivery McDonald’s at 11pm on a Friday night was just what the doctor ordered. Specifically , a mcchicken, fries, and some of that absolutely slapping Coke Zero. Could not have accomplished this without the help of this app. Have ordered like 4 times with it since we been here now. Always quick, orders arrive accurately, and food is warm/hot. | In Czechia/The Czech Republic this service is better than Uber eats by allowing grocery delivery and food delivery and providing a vast array of goods and foods | Downloaded the app to use their 200kc discount but it was refused. Tried again on my wife’s phone, refused. Deleted the app and picked up food myself. Probably not to use delivery services anyway, bad for restaurants. | Compared to Bolt the user interface is terrible. We cannot see a map showing where the rider is. And the estimate is just not right. It always says less than 5 minutes away and then you have to wait another 20. | The deliveries are often 1-3 hours late. Support can't even contact the drivers or restaurants and even when it's obvious the food isn't coming, they won't give refunds. Try literally any other delivery service in Prague. | have been burned multiple times where orders are just not delivered at all. use wolt. dame jidlo is trash | Někdy to je dobrý ale někdy mě tak naserou ze už ani nemám chuť jist | The app is very easy to use requiring minimum number of steps to order food. The selection of restaurants is also very good. Great job! | Ordered a pizza at 7pm.  Dame Jidlo said 25 minutes.  90 minutes later they cancelled my order.  Total BS. | While the selection of restaurants amidst a pandemic might be limited, the quality of the food I’ve ordered, the customer service, and the delivery can’t be beat. | The time is kind of good,but sometimes it will get over the main time about 5 minutes. Overall it’s really nice app. | no favorites and no way to repeat an order, and lots of bugs - delivery works tho! | Ordered pizza and it was going to be delayed which is not a big deal, it happens. 

But then they emailed saying trying to reach me- I’m at a hotel and gave hotel number because it kept turning my a czech number. 
So they said call them right away.  I do, they hung up.  I asked them to call me.  Nothing.  I call back.... and as soon as the person answers and I say they emailed me.... they hung up again. 

Back to Uber eats that delivered to my hotel room and appreciated a big tip. | Impossible to search by cuisine. Can’t delete cart and start over.  Cant sort by rating, name, delivery time. Numerous “hidden charges “ called “packaging fees”. Felt like an accomplishment to actually succeed in placing order (and would note prices seem higher than in restaurant plus delivery and pack fees) | Našel jsem bug a jednu nelogiku. Když do košíku přidáte jídlo tak značek na ikoně nákupního košíku nestačí. Hledal jsem jestli se mi jídlo přidalo. A oak když mám klávesnici a píšu do input pole tak jí pak nemůžu minimalizovat nebo sjet formulářem dolů abych mohl použít button pro zaplacení. | God bless delivery apps and God bless DameJidlo | Prosím aktualizujte aplikaci pro novější zařízení.",4.64916,124913,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/b5/97/e1/b597e14d-5dbc-0b50-7fd9-97f98b9ce5ed/62b42ebc-cb47-4f6a-8c44-21886fb48938_1b__U005bPLEASE_USE_THIS_U005d.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/a4/eb/33/a4eb3388-580f-339d-0b6e-b389ec88b29e/9b209827-46e5-4da6-9f4a-123eafe90b7e_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/67/55/7f/67557f7c-c248-7b2b-ceeb-3a0ad3ebc8f5/4ef1a08c-4b69-4a50-beda-bbe8a25785a1_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/9d/3d/85/9d3d857b-7bf0-e399-1f99-d7596283fdae/35f10ba5-703a-4d87-959e-1d80251ce0e5_iPhone_1242x2208_CZ_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/5d/23/0b/5d230b82-65f4-22eb-6d8a-45e19f49a4fb/3628f748-6ceb-4cd9-87a6-dbea5b31f926_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/ce/1e/a8/ce1ea827-a9ec-8237-a737-159c19c28f3e/f4a2c3d0-3b46-4630-bfb6-cd7da28026c2_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/d0/f1/de/d0f1dea6-70be-0753-c230-c890adc2b4ac/19345b93-e4ea-40a2-a98f-30585605818c_7.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Aplikace Meteoradar je jednou z nejstahovanějších aplikací na iPhone a iPad. Aplikace nabízí řadu zajímavých funkcí. Zobrazí nejen aktuální srážky nad Českem, ale i jejich předpověď na následující hodinu. Nechybí ani údaje o aktuálních teplotách, větru, srážkách nebo stavu počasí. Meteoradar umožňuje sledovat vývoj počasí téměř v reálném čase. Data jsou aktualizována každých 10 minut.

* Srážky a jejich předpověď (radar)
Aplikace na mapě zobrazí aktuální srážky nad Českem a Německem s přesností až 1 km. Nechybí ani předpověď jejich vývoje na následující hodinu (dostupné u českého radaru). Přesně tak poznáte, kdy přeháňka dorazí přímo do vašeho města. Radarové snímky Česka poskytuje ČHMÚ a snímky Německa poskytuje DWD.

* Údaje z meteostanic
Na mapě jsou dostupné údaje z více než 150 meteorologických stanic. Meteorologické stanice zaznamenávají teplotu, vítr, srážky ale i vlhkost nebo tlak vzduchu. U každé stanice je v grafu uveden vývoj teploty.

* Blesky
V případě bouřek aplikace zobrazí i místa, kde uhodil blesk. Na základě radarového snímku potom poznáte, jak se bude bouřka nadále vyvíjet.

* Meteozprávy
Aplikace zobrazuje informace o počasí přímo od uživatelů, kteří sledují počasí v daných místech.

* Přidávejte informace o počasí
Aplikace umožňuje zasílat informace o počasí ve vaší lokalitě. Pokud se u vás vyskytuje například silná bouřka, stačí v aplikaci vytvořit hlášení o počasí, které si následně přečtou stovky lidí. Přidat můžete aktuální fotografii či popis počasí. Ostatní lidi tak varujete před nepříznivým počasím, které panuje ve vašem městě a pravděpodobně zasáhne i další.  

* Widget
Díky přehlednému widgetu získáte rychlý přehled o aktuálních srážkách na našem území.

Poskytovatelem radarových snímků a detekce blesků z Česka je Český hydrometeorologický ústav. Poskytovatelem radarových snímků Německa je DWD.

-Wake up feeling refreshed in your light sleep phase with our intelligent alarm clock, featuring gentle nature sounds.

I live in pacific standard time zone and recently started working for a firm based in the east coast so I am now working east coast hours starting at 5am meaning I have to wake by 4am. Prior to this job, I was lucky to get out of bed by 11am, regardless of what time I went to sleep. For the first week of my new job I woke up on time with like 15 minutes to get ready before jumping on my computer; with sleep monitor I am able to be up and refreshed at 4am like I need to be. I am so grateful for the app that has so far conquered my decades long battle with sleep issues!! | Wonderful to use while tracking sound and sleep patterns | It helps my sleep better and it tell me if I have been sleep talking I have been for a while but now it has gotten less and less for me I am so happy this has helped me so much!:) | How do I make sure subscription doesn’t renew | Es excelente por que tiene muchas funciones buenas. | Great! | App nice | I have slept better. | It helps me sleep at night | Funciona 👍 | I started this app about a month ago and it been really helpful with my sleep schedule. I never knew before if I snored and this app helped me realize I definitely do lol I enjoy the breathing exercises before bed and the sounds they have available. Most of all I enjoy the stats. Knowing my average sleep time and if I’m getting a deep enough sleep every night  10/10 recommend if you want to get to know yourself a bit better. | Apparently I slept great and was asleep all night not making a noise. Not. I woke up multiple times even got out of bed. Talked my my dog, dropped a book. All while this was recording and absolutely nothing. This is such a scam. | I am sleeping so much better now. I actually feel good the next day. | It’s so cool to hear what noises I make at night | Amazing recommend 100% | Really helps me track my sleep throughout the night and helps me know if I had good rest | Ffh | Awesome app | The best sleep I’ve ever had | I want to try it for a few days to see how it goes | I like how there is some music but I don’t like how you HAVE to pay to be able to hear your talking or snoring. I wish you didn’t have to pay bc some people can’t pay and that’s not fair. | Excelente sleep monitoring, improved sleep and increased overall mood | This thing works really good and it’s funny hearing if I sleep talk or anything like that | Muy bien | Very good!! | Great | Just starting. Will keep ya posted. | Excelente app para rastrear mis patrones de sueño. La recomiendo | Awesome | I like the app fr , helps me keep track of my medical promblem with my sleeping progress so it’s a big help. Only promblem I have with the app, should be free in my opinion like it’s not fully developed app yet. I would only charge people if you put more stuff into the app, for example like a alarm clock to wake you up. Y'all can come up with so much good ideas☺️. Keep up the good work creators | Can’t wait to try this tonight ! | :) | If you sleep with any type of fan (mine is a pretty quiet overhead fan), you will only get a “light sleep” rating all night due to “environmental noise”. So all your stats and recorded noises are thrown into chaos because the app doesn’t understand the fan life. 

Oh and if your heater/AC kicks on, heaven help your environmental noise score. 

Also, if you have a mattress that does lint transfer movements, the app thinks you don’t move all night long so your sleep scores are also incorrect. 

I also use the SleepWatch app (got this one to track how many times I cough, talk, etc) and the SleepWatch app uses your watch to track sleep patterns and score and it’s FAR better than this worthless app. 

Turned off auto renew and will likely never use it again. Waste of money. 

-10/10 recommend | Best sleep I have had in a very long time | Love | Otimo aplicativo, super recomendo 👍🏼 | I’ve had 3 back surgeries, all failed! I’ve had Hip Surgeries including a replacement, I have nerve damage, occipital neuralgia, and My Sleep Number is so soothing. Even though I received the wrong mattress, so I’m So Thankful 🙏🏼 Sincerely Lori ⭐️ | Love the app. | Costs money not cool I’m not paying just to track my sleep
😡 | I was blown away just after my first night using this.

It was so much fun. Now whenever I click on an image it’ll take me to Wattpad, a 404 message, or an article written by a bot. It’s gotten so spammy and full of ads. And they STILL haven’t fixed the issue with the home page refreshing after leaving the app then coming back later. I’m really frustrated and disappointed with how much worse Pinterest has gotten.

3/24- Update: It seems like there’s more ad videos now. The issue with refreshing has gotten a little better, I still don’t understand why the app developers thought refreshing constantly would be a good idea. 
Now I never see stuff from the people I follow, on my home page, anymore. It’s just all suggested stuff and ads. It’s really disappointing what Pinterest has become. | Love using this apt | Very nice app bought a ton of clothes because of Pinterest 😋 | Test | اصبح تطبيق سئ جداً فهو لايجعل خصوصيه للمستخدم يحذف المحفوظات في الملحق تلقائياً و ضعيف لا يعرض الصور ولا المقاطع بشكل جيد | I have this app on both my iPad and phone. On my phone I can make collages but I can’t on my iPad,but other than that no complaints I absolutely love the app!!!!!! | App crashes constantly, screen goes black. When I open a pin it closes the entire app and when I open it again it removes the home, search, and pin buttons. This has been going on for over a year with no fix, on 3 different phones too. Please update. | I love this app there is so many cute things like decor ideas, ideas for quiencenera’s,funny videos,cute videos and lots of memes and cute Fanart. But my problem is, if it says 12+ and I’m twelve and I put it in as 2011 it says you are not eligible to join Pinterest. So I used my dads account because I couldn’t create my own but I love Pinterest it’s an awesome app and it’s helping me plan my, room, cat supplies,hair and quincenera.

I can no longer reply to others, I’ll be halfway through writing a comment and it will take away the type box and delete everything, I’ll even finish and press post and it doesn’t send the comment. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it, it’s been completely ruined with this update. | ok. usually when apps companies update their app it gets better. NOT PINTEREST APPARENTLY!!!! i cant message people through the app anymore, nor can i see my followers. and some of my friends and family that i follow it wont show. not even when i search for their profile. there are also many different dumb unnecessary updates, like when i post something it wont allow me to turn on comment. i’ve asked others if these things are the same for them- and surprise surprise it is. and on top of all of this it randomly turned my business account to a normal account messing up a lot of stuff i’ve been working on for months. i’m 16 years old and the terms of service says that if you’re 16 years old or older you should have control over this stuff. also they do random updates where it completely messes up my For You to just random stuff like makeup, jordans, and nail stuff, which i have never saved or marked as my interests. which there is nothing wrong with people who like that, i just personally don’t like that stuff. so why is it being recommended as the default even though i never saved anything like that? and if mark as “irrelevant to me” it still shows it. so i doubt customer service will see this, but please fix these problems. and fix them the right way. i really do love pinterest but every time they do something weird to it i start using it less and less. | I used to love going on Pinterest for inspiration, but now there’s an ad almost every other post (not even including promoted content). This makes it extremely difficult to use the app. | Hairstyles for my long hair

Love them All! ❤️ Bonnie Jean | Every morning I hightail up to 7 11 
for a fresh brewed Coffee filled Yeti, 
sit in my ride, engage in mind drifting, listen to Smooth Jazz & vist Pinterest 
to pick out around 5 interesting pictures 
to upload to FaceBook with my personal thoughts across the top 

Just for the record, I take Pride in 
the pictures that I select 

I certainly appreciate the variety of pictures available to choose from and again, 
I engage in that action every single day 

In fact, I look foreword to doing so 

                      Sincerely;
                                         John Apostolou 
                                          A. K. A. Yanni | Every single pin I open lately is an ad!!!! | It only shows you what it has decided you will see.

Your entire feed will become these few things you hate!

It will vehemently pile those upon you without any working customization for yourself. Even after saying you do NOT want to see it EVERY TIME IT POPS UP, pinterest will continue to shove it down your throat and only show you those.

 I have boards that pinterest out right refuses to show more similar or related content about that is not against the guidelines and has a plethora of unseen content that I've searched for, tapped on, liked, and saved! The worthless algorithm is stuck and cant update based on its own customization that it consistently and annoyingly thrusts upon the users | When I try to zoom in on a picture it freezes up my phone.  Why can’t this issue be fixed? | I love this app but there are way too many ads. | i’ve noticed pinterest has started deleting my replies to comments on my pins. super frustrating as i will reply to someone, answer a question, etc. but then it disappears and looks like im ignoring them. pls fix this | Me and best friend love this app so much it is the best app ever created me and her send memes to each other every day like the preppy Peppa Pig meme and I love everything about it | Pinterest is the best no adds and lots of things to look at | Wayyy too many ads. And now I can’t flag something that is suggested to me as not interested | I love going down the Pinterest rabbit hole just as much as the next person who is trying to escape reality. However, there are a few things that need to be addressed…

1. Too many ads
2. Too buggy

Thanks for listening. | The new policies and using ai to monitor the platform is causing so many people to either lose their accounts from faulty reports or consider leaving Pinterest entirely. The new CEO wants it to be a shopping site which isn’t even the reason why Pinterest grew so popular in the first place, and now there’s an insane amount of scammy ads which just makes it difficult to use. You don’t have to be experienced in marketing to understand that frustrating and ignoring the needs of your audience is actually gonna cause you to lose money as a company, because people will just end up deactivating their accounts if they haven’t been auto-banned already. Just from taking a few minutes to read through the r/pinterest subreddit I found so many people who are struggling with the exact same things I am. And I mean HUNDREDS of people talking about how completely normal, safe, appropriate pins they’ve saved have been removed because, guess what, ai can’t correctly or accurately tell the difference between normal/sfw and explicit/harmful content. Not that the CEO cares though since he’s been deleting people’s comments with complaints on Twitter. If things don’t change for the better, chances are Pinterest will lose a lot of users and therefore lose revenue from getting too greedy, which I’d hate to see because I used to love the platform. Stop relying on tech bros and ai systems and start actually caring about the people who support you as a company. | I put my birth year and it said I'm not eligible to sign up LIKE IM OVER 12 | UGHHH with the update! I prefer to have the option of hiding my secret board pins from my main feed or at least have the ability to see my main feed how other’s would. I prefer being able to quickly go to a feed to see what I (or who I follow) recently pinned as well. PLEASE FIX THIS! | I do NOT fw this update, it looks so much better when you can see the text bigger on the amount of pins you have, i am BEGGING you to change the layout slightly back PLEASE | I can’t get into the app I’m doing my right age and stuff and gmail and it’s not letting me in I and it keeps saying that  something is going wrong on there end. And you can’t sign in after 2011 and if I do my age it ask me again to confirm and then it doesn’t do anything after that. | Comments and likes are not visible | i  was noticing that everytime i make a vid that doesn’t have a 9:16 ratio aspect have bad audio quality than the ones that do have a 9:16 ratio aspect.  let me know if this was intentional or its a bug that needs to be fixed. | I like Pinterest as a site a ton- the suggestion algorithm is a notch above anything else I’ve seen in finding all sorts of interesting art, media, references etc. 
I avoid using the app at all costs. 
The navigation is sensitive and constantly closes boards when I’m trying to scroll, the suggestions are sometimes a lot worse than what I find on the web version, ability to edit pins on the app is handicapped, pinning something within the app doesn’t work most of the time, pinning from other apps doesn’t allow you to enter a title, the alphabetical sort is different between the app and the web (1 at the top on web and below z in app) just really inconsistent all around. | They removed the feature that allowed you to put photos in the comments, 0/10 do not get this app we boycott bois | it was way better before the ads started to appear, i still use it though | I just want to shout out the Pinterest people and say THANK YOU for adding chat reactions!!!! Now I can keep on track with what comment is referring to which post. Thank you Pinterest people! | fix the app it’s not showing all my created photos | This app is my go to for everything good from recipes to education of anything I need etc gardening tips house cleaning fashion. I sent messages to all my friends as to cute and handy every day quotes. I love this app | This app turn me on | They added an ‘interested’ option to the press and hold fly out wheel -  but there’s too many options now and you can’t see the fly out half the time. 

Some suggestions; 

1 - reduce the number of options 

2 - Allow users to customize the fly out 

3 - take the L and revert back | It’s an awesome app🙂👍🏽.",4.78294,43920,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/4d/10/eb/4d10eb02-6512-babc-9e69-d2e26dfe45ad/d4ece8ef-fbad-461e-92f1-63bf4bc7b18e_230731_Q4_AppStore-H2_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_1242x2208_iPhone-5.5_Multivertical_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d6/f1/d8/d6f1d88b-0cbc-d4c5-63d4-946fde694493/7800d90e-6561-498c-94e3-0932f2aaaf31_230731_Q4_AppStore-H2_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_1242x2208_iPhone-5.5_Multivertical_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/75/5e/7a/755e7a34-a02d-b226-b5ef-8acabb9cccff/f4f0e726-d081-4cee-87e0-7aff87aae591_230731_Q4_AppStore-H2_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_1242x2208_iPhone-5.5_Multivertical_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6e/14/ab/6e14ab4f-6cf7-b482-6170-01338ac5df71/81c38cd0-68b2-494c-81eb-cf4d084f59d4_230731_Q4_AppStore-H2_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_1242x2208_iPhone-5.5_Multivertical_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b2/98/c8/b298c8d7-b393-d567-30e3-f3be7988accb/ed2606d1-4d6b-4284-b790-d01dc659828d_230731_Q4_AppStore-H2_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_1242x2208_iPhone-5.5_Multivertical_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/41/d4/95/41d495ff-1421-e84a-c8f6-f13827566897/11783370-6a42-4be0-ade2-3f78174e4d7f_230731_Q4_AppStore-H2_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_1242x2208_iPhone-5.5_Multivertical_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/de/53/08/de53080b-b600-29dd-37d7-eef596d5d9cd/4a76324e-58ac-4031-bbf9-21c0ed3e56f1_230731_Q4_AppStore-H2_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_1242x2208_iPhone-5.5_Multivertical_7.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/00/d0/9c/00d09c1a-02ce-e6e8-34fa-226b525af94f/eab582dd-a767-496d-9a0b-d9c28da1b150_220207_AppStoreCustomPage_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_2048x2732_iPad-12.9_Multivertical_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7a/56/51/7a56511f-a03b-3eef-c9c9-b6631fc4a027/1c10849e-87f3-463e-a245-7c2f0fd20757_220207_AppStoreCustomPage_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_2048x2732_iPad-12.9_Multivertical_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ad/a8/3c/ada83cf0-b087-b639-b802-ce53a190c48c/166e2192-0404-4d2a-ab82-387c416dc610_220207_AppStoreCustomPage_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_2048x2732_iPad-12.9_Multivertical_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/d3/bf/06/d3bf0688-e00a-f875-82a7-8b730ceac5ef/66460914-5e76-428e-ae99-674b80978e90_220207_AppStoreCustomPage_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_2048x2732_iPad-12.9_Multivertical_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/23/00/39/23003950-edae-b6a4-019a-98874630d543/969b529a-ce64-49af-b297-cd52c132290c_220207_AppStoreCustomPage_EN_iOSApp_Image-Designed_2048x2732_iPad-12.9_Multivertical_5.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadPro

686449807,"ph.telegra.Telegraph","Telegram Messenger","https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807?uo=4","Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 800 million active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

3) App crashes in general when sending a message.

Imagine watching a show with 3 seasons with only 2 available. Or a movie trilogy where the first is missing. Or the fact that there are some titles where they just show the last movie. I wouldn’t recommend this for anyone who loves movies and shows. I love watching everything but if its 1 thing i cant stand is watching a show with missing episodes or missing movies in a series. | I get it, some peeps share their Netflix password and Netflix has ‘ideas’ how to cut that. But those ideas SCREW UP THE EXPERIENCE for the ‘good actors’, peeps who have multiple devices in the same household. …. It throws you out of your account and you have to periodically tell Netflix that it’s still you - the one who’s been paying their salaries through membership for many years. wow - what a screwup. 

Deleting that app, canceling my subscription - don’t have time for Netflix’s anti-password share greed activities. 

Bye. Hello Disney, Amazon and Apple TV.

(Should be 1-star, but content is good, so 2-stars). | These is dose not have anything to do with the app but netflix i need all the inuyasha season's | Netflix is good but you can’t used it in other locations and they added adds now. It is like they only care about the money | So I tried to watch Netflix on my phone and for some reason I couldn’t get into my account. It said I had to put in the password so I did and it did not work. | It’s probs the best app for movies and shows etc. :DDDD | netflix is scamming at this point. high prices, low quality content, household policy. just switch | Hello, 

Just letting your company know what is happening with some accounts with the new Household and WiFi network restrictions. I saw that I couldn’t access my account anymore on my WiFi at my new apartment, so I was disappointed. I know my dad uses it at his house, but I also don’t want to pay more a month to watch the content. Luckily I have AppleTV, Prime video and Hulu to choose from after that! Bummer that I can’t watch Netflix anymore but at least I have those! Just went right to Amazon Prime after that. | Netflix can u PLEASE PUT SEASON1 AND 2 BACK UP LIKE PLEASE THATS MY FAV SHOW AND UR MAKING MY LIFE MISERABLE | With as much money as we’re spending on this app you would think we would be getting our moneys worth instead the app logs me out and says my device is not apart of the Netflix household even though the app has been downloaded on my tablet for years. And yes it’s been updated, yes the password and username are correct, yes the bill has been paid, and no it’s not my device. Fix it. | Netflix works great, problem is the dominos game was working now states “an error has occurred please try again later sorry for the inconvenience” 

Please fix the problem. 

Thank you. | It’s good but can you please add be the cartoon grinch,coraline, and all of the monster high tv shows/short movies | This app and company have been going downhill for a long time, but I've hit my breaking point. The app layout CONSTANTLY changes. None of these changes are ever necessary, and they make the app worse and harder to use. Not to mention that Netflix as a company keeps making worse and worse shows and movies, and cancel the rare good ones that they manage to squeeze out. But I kept it, because my family still used it on occasion. Today I opened the app for the once-in-a-blue-moon that I ever open Netflix, only for the app to tell me I'm ""not a part"" of MY OWN HOUSEHOLD. The only reason that had been left to use Netflix is that multiple people can share an account, but with the sheer audacity of them to charge an arm and a leg for ONE account, banning password sharing WITHIN A HOUSEHOLD is the last straw. I'd give negative stars if I could for this unusable app and scummy company. Your money is better spent elsewhere. | What is the point of even having the app is I can’t watch anywhere other than home? Netflix has gone down the drain in recent years and I will be cancelling my membership. It’s no longer worth spending money on and I will be moving to a different streaming platform. | Signed out of ALL devices from the website. Logged into 2 devices I use . The 3rd (my iPhone) gives the error message the device is not part of house hold , but only have 2/4 devices signed in per the website . HHHHHHOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!?!?!?! And yes I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Same message!!!! | no me aparece nana😔 | These ads are straight unreal and ridiculous. For YEARS there has been no ads and now you guys put ads? Take them off before you lose more money. | La pollo | Can’t log in “password is wrong” (same password 8 years now works on the tv)
Can’t reset password “error email not found “ (same email address as always triple checked tried on several different days) | Won’t allow me to watch in my own home, it should be illegal. Cancelling all subscriptions with them, never use Netflix they’re bloody thieves | The new update is ok but I can’t find anything now and half of the stuff from continue watching is gone. Also, basically all of the anime I have been watching the past few years is gone and know I am basically left with none of my old shows.😭😭😭💀☠️ | the new household is stupid, canˋt watch anything if im not on my house is annoying and stupid. | I’ve always watched Netflix on my phone rather then my tv or computer, so as of recently I now have to get a temporary code to be able to use the service I pay for on my phone. So basically if you ever plan on not watching it on your tv you better be ready to have to go through a couple apps before you can have access to your account. Ended up cancelling cause they release a good show maybe once every 2 years anyways. A shame they raise pricing more and more then cut access to phone users | Netflix has become a greedy corporation and it seems to be worse than others. They kicked me off my family’s account because I’m not on the same network anymore as them. Sorry that I was military, got stationed away from home, and my father wanted to keep my expenses to a minimum. Y’all are absolutely ridiculous and not worth the hassle. | Greedy parasites just can’t seem to let go of their obsession with squeezing every last ounce of money they can from their consumers. I’m glad I canceled my membership because their catalog isn’t even worth the basic price | Unsubscribed | No real improvements to any of this.

The Netflix App is pretty much one of the worst in the market these days. It fails miserably on simple tasks, like it routinely shows you visually that it remembers where you left off (red bar is in about the right place, button text says resume), but when you try to resume, it simply starts at the beginning. This happens about 15% of the time when you stop and resume on the same device, and almost half the time when you are changing devices. The UI is also a disaster and just getting worse all the time. Your “My List” will randomly disappear or relocate itself, the team is proud of the dark ui changes they make, which make the product harder to use but artificially inflate their use/engagement numbers, and various menu items like notifications or whole content sections will randomly disappear and reappear or just bug out when you select anything. The app will only go into PiP mode about 80% of the time, and always pauses. The app also pauses on tablets when you slide anything over. Like, WHY?! The subscription has become much more expensive, and content quality is getting worse every day. The company seems to think their UI and processes are good, but really they’re not, they just had a great idea and implemented it before everyone else, so they were the only way and many people grew up with and got used to it, but it never made it good. Their foreign content (non-US) is still very good, but also seems to be on the decline, and their streaming quality is still very good. Their US content, however, only has a few good properties left and tend to be one-offs or seasons from much earlier that are wrapping up. They like to say they have the best products, properties, culture, etc, but they really don’t. I use the iOS products the most, but their android apps are no better, and I use the web and smart tv app on occasion and they are definitely worse. The frustration of using this app is no longer worth the price with so many other, better, cheaper options available. | I pay great money for the services and i can’t even use it on all platforms. they underpay actors and actresses for the streaming services, but then they overpay us, so where is the money going? Dont buy; just pirate shows. | I’m a college student under a Netflix my parents pay for, the household rule is ridiculous. They already have a limit to how many people can be on an account, is it really necessary to block people based on where they live? It’s such a blatant money grab, it’s honestly embarrassing for Netflix. Raising the price while making it harder to use is just going to send the (already dying) service into the toilet. | The new update to Netflix households is so inconsiderate to families with college students. I spend half of my year at school and the other half at home, but now I can’t access netflix at school. Terrible, truly do not care about their paying customers | 🤓🤓👍 | no total drama world tour?no no no😡 | Crazy how it keeps getting more expensive, with less content. Now they’re even blocking some movies behind a pay wall so their ‘standard’ isn’t good enough to be able to watch your favorite movie | PLEASE get rid of Netflix households. If anything it’s probably hurting you guys more then helping. It’s just annoying and Ik ur trying to stop hackers and get more money but some people can’t pay for subscriptions that’s why they share. Don’t get me wrong, Netflix has an amazing selection of shows but this is ridiculous. | I can stream on my browser on my IPad! So, is this a massive app update failure, or another way to try to squeeze more $ from people who are already paying top rate?
Either way, not a great look. | You don’t want me using your platform using my family’s account? Fine, I won’t use it at all. Remember blockbuster? You are next if you keep up this garbage. Keep pissing off your customers and see where it gets you. Greedy corporate goblins. | Add back ability to have multiple homes....this is absurd. If I spend a good part of my time on a seperate place's wifi, I should be able to watch Netflix there - especially at these prices. | I see why this policy was introduced but it’s actually ridiculous.

I’m a minor, i live with my mom and only see my dad on weekends, i use all of my dads streaming services including netflix; however i can’t use netflix while im with my mom which is the majority of the time. My mom doesn’t have netflix only my dad does. Since the policy i’ve only been able to watch netflix at his house, which is CRAZY. there was NOTHING wrong with how netflix functioned before the policy, but now it’s so irritating. This policy is greedy and unnecessary, so what if people were sharing their accounts with friends? ITS THEIR ACCOUNT THAT THEY THEMSELVES PAY FOR? I know other reasons is like people stealing accounts but instead of robbing people of being able to share their accounts netflix could enforce their security. | From fall to now, there have been Quite A Few titles that don’t have audio description on Netflix but they do elsewhere. Please fix.

To start out with. I am blind. I have Paramount plus, which has a heading that they update every month that is titled Enjoy Before They’re Gone. And then it has a lot of the movies that will be leaving that month or the next month underneath. And then Tubi TV also has a heading like that titled Leaving Soon. On Netflix, when you’re blind you have to go through the movies that you might want to watch every month to see if they will be taken off that month. I was wondering if you would create a similar heading, or put the leaving soon titles underneath the New and Hot tab. I don’t think it would be hard to do. This would be greatly appreciated. For the Netflix original titles that leave, you should make sure the audio descriptions for those titles go with. For example Hemlock Grove had audio descriptions on Netflix but not on it’s new homes. Thank you for any consideration. | Yall should have never changed things recently. Especially with family not being able to watch(no they will not be purchasing it themselves because of this company’s pettiness and greediness) on top of the fact that the app itself has gone downhill in quite a few ways. The ONLY thing Netflix is doing right is no ads on the subscription we pay for. one more price increase or some bull when most of us have paid for this app for a good 10 years or more & I’m canceling companies need to stop taking advantage and being so greedy when the companies are VERY successful. | My family used to share our account with my poor old Gramma and not she has to pay for her own subscription. And you removed the Reputation Stadium Tour. And a bunch of Pokémon. AND REPLACED IT WITH @&$#ING COCOMELON. Nobody gives a $&@# about Cocomelon. Nobody. | What is the app for if I can’t watch anything outside of my home.. “you’re not under the connected login WiFi” | yall doing too much for this | I finally cancelled my subscription after growing tired of price increases and poor content. Netflix now consists of an abundance old shows and movies. Follow up seasons for new shows are not available until several months later and there isn’t enough new content. | Netflix has become so greedy hungry the last couple of years, increasing the price and their household policy is ridiculous. | I cancelled because I shared the account with my nieces who don’t live with me but since you now being charged an extra fee for non household member I can’t justify keeping it. I only watched once in awhile but wanted to see if anything interested me. | Why do you feel the need to remove people if they’re not in the household. Can’t have nothing nice anymore I swear. | I’m super frustrated. It won’t move on to the next episode even thou auto play is on. Makes me want to ditch Netflix. | i never thought netflix would update in a million years bro | My mom can’t share her account with me, so now we have to get a new subscription.

The hotel staff saved it for us and contacted us about it. Very helpful and nice of them!
Very pleased with the hotel. | If you try to contact property via chat in the app. The app just crashes. Copy your message before you press send. The app will crash. So you will have to paste the message a few times and then it might be sent | I love this App!!  I’ve never been disappointed the many times I’ve used for reservations. It’s easy, affordable, and very informative!! | They have added so many options to the room choices for no refund and limited refund times that by the time you book you miss the fact that the date was not the date you originally picked.  I did everything including contacting the hotel to correct and they left me hanging.   Done don’t use it.  Hotel desk says it is happening quite often. | Almost always use on last minute trips. | Multiple issues in the first month of using. I booked 8 different stays in the last two months and was trying Booking.com out for the first time. Previously I have used multiple other sites and vacation rental sites. At first glance it appears to work smooth but now after multiple issues and poor customer service I'll be switching back and no longer using this app. | He utilizado Booking.com varias veces y nunca he tenido problemas. Los recomiendo. | Rooms were clean and accommodating the staff was very courteous and the location could not be more centric ( one block to the beach and half block to 5th ave were all the shops and restaurants are located. The pool was very nice also. | we were her for 6 nights. Great staff very friendly and helpful. place is rundown but clean. In a vey populated area but easy to get to anywhere. | Love using booking.com app.
It’s extremely easy and convenient | The room was clean, neat and comfortable.  I stayed 2 nights, slept well both nights. Wear a sleep mask because there is a street light out front.  I was grateful to find these accommodations so close to the convention center.  Three days parking downtown was almost the price of the room before tax.  I recommend this room for one adult who needs to sleep and perhaps handle some computer paperwork while in the room.  The kitchen was accessible, clean and the two bathrooms shared by 4 rooms were both clean and nice.  Good Job, landlord! | This stay was very convenient and accommodating. I had 24/7 assistance for any questions or concerns I may have had. The location was very convenient for me as I was there for business. The house was very clean, spacious, and up to date !

The location is in the city but I loved that the most about it because I am a CITY GIRL !

I’ll definitely be returning and I would recommend this stay 100 % | Easy booking or change | Súper clean, modern beautiful decoration, the owner, Iris super nice. Let us check it very early and check out very late | This app is very easy to use. And you get a good price. | Amo la app. Protege mucho al cliente. Altamente recomendada | The holiday inn is one of my favorite hotels and they serve a great breakfast here. The staff are amazing and the rooms are super clean and comfortable. | I always check booking.com first to find hotels at where I’m going because it offers easy ways to navigate through so many different options. It’s an essential app for travelers! | Удобно, быстро, надежно | اشكر طاقم عمل بودل وبلاخص الاخ محمود المصري اسلوب راقي وتعامل سمح عسى الله يبيض وجه ويرزقه من حيث لايحتسب | Wonderful clean apartment new up to date furniture and beds nice modern look!!  No hassle owner quick and easy got here and went to sleep Ty | App is easy to use!  I always refer to the app
When I am setting up a trip    Glad I found it! | Have used Booking.com for the last 25 yrs 
Above and beyond pleased with service❤️ | OK, seriously the owner, Maclir goes above and beyond. You can tell he really wants his guests to have a good experience and is passionate about his place. First off, he reached out to me before I arrived and offered to come pick me up from the ferry for a small fee. I have NEVER had anyone from a hostel do this. This was way better than getting a taxi and he popped out of no where at the pier it was so welcoming and honestly set the tone for how amazing my experience was in this island. As soon as we arrived to the home stay he gave me a run down about the island. Which beaches to go, where to eat and what there is to do. Again, goes above and beyond. I ended up having to move to a new location since he was fully booked and I wanted to stay longer which I was a little sad about but he even helped me move my stuff to my new place. Like I said he’s a really good guy and willing to always help out his guests. The rooms were cute, he definitely keeps up with them and even makes your bed for you which I appreciated. I was amazing at how on point he is! | اكثر من رائع جعل للذي ابتكر هذا التتطبيق للجنة يارب | I really this motel the workers really nice love the rooms | Two bookings in a row have been completely screwed up - one never went to the property, but thankfully they had room and were able to book me manually at check-in.  The second I
Booked a year in advance and did not get the room type that I reserved, and ended up in a room that did not fit our family.  Only two stars because we did end up getting some sort of room, but I cannot trust the app to work correctly. | They moved their headquarters to Netherlands. Now they are not under the better business bureau. Their customer service is not responding or either responding and hanging up to your face. They are doing very shady business. Saying that they didn’t get any response from the hotel but when the hotel send us the emails between the hotel and booing.com they agree to do a refund. Only it has been a month and they didn’t issue the refund. The customer service is not responding. Never ever use that app or website again. It should be banned. | Everything was good | Was fast an easy booking | I lived here shear and looking to go back for a glorious year once again !! | Have been using booking for years and it’s service has definitely surpassed all the others I’ve used including a company provided booking with discounts site, I can always find good deals although please be aware that some properties that use booking are shams and not to be trusted. Let’s build a booking community with only safe hotels and stays where everyone can see in reviews the bad and poor business some hospitality places practice! | El depa muy bonito limpio accesible sin ruido una ducha enorme y abundante todo funciona al 100 gracias regreso | perfect place, perfect people! i recomend it with 100% 🫶🏻 | For a few days now messages are not being loaded, either on the app or on the web. Customer Service only offers ways to report an issue with a booking, not with the app / website itself, which is both annoying and frustrating. | This app finds you the great deals for hotels it helped me when I went to Washington DC I recommend anyone to get this app you won’t be disappointed | Although we haven’t had much luck with the properties where we have stayed, I have to give a resounding “THANK YOU, BOOKING!!!!”. I’ve never had such amazing success with customer service experiences and this one has been world class!!! Thanks for resolving all of our issues and being a true concierge service. Other places should take a page from your book! | La mejor opción para compartir con tu familia | In more than 17 years that I have been using this application, I must say: this is the best app and the best support I have seen in the world. | I love app makes so easy to find a place to stay! Easy to cancel if bad weather or emergency comes up.  It’s so easy and convenient! Now days the simplest things are the best. | Nice | This is the best place to stay if you want to rest and enjoy nature, learn about wine and olive cultive.. their wine it’s delicious( home made wine) the service is ultimate, the owners are on top of every detail to give you the best comfort.. it’s near to other famous town like Volterra were twilight movie was made! They prepared a delicious breakfast or dinner! Espacious room with kitchen too! More than happy to comback here and more than thank you! I stay with my husband,Daughter and mother-in-law. | Beautiful rooms. Great location close to everything. Very clean and friendly atmosphere. 
Mara was great help . | Do not i repeat do not use this app. I recently just got scammed out of 173$. They changed my departure date without my consent, changed the second payment date and then proceeded to cancel my reservation because I didn’t pay the second payment two weeks earlier than I was supposed to. They’re not helpful and kept talking me in circles. | I’m extremely pleased with my experience with this hotel. My friend suggested me to use Hampton for my layover In Istanbul. I did my research on booking.com and was surprised that there are so many bad reviews. I’m very picky chooser when it comes to the environment of the hotel and I said to my friend that Hampton is out of my list bc of such negative reviews. He told me that I shouldn’t  be worried about bad reviews and go there. And so I did! The reality is: hotel is nice and clean, STAFF speaks English and EXTREMELY helpful, professional and polite. Service is great! Nice Gym, nice breakfast with big variety of food for everyone. So please, don’t let negative reviews distract you from staying in Hampton only because someone had « worst» experience due their general dissatisfaction and ungratefulness in life. Thank you guys(Staff) for you professionalism and  accommodation for all my need. | جدا ممتاز للحجز | Alllll sters 4 this ap 👍👍👍 | My preference is booking.com they’re pretty good at lower prices and correcting errors made when you’re booking through them. Therefore I’m tapping 5 stars⭐️ | Love using Booking.com! It’s always been reliable and easy to use.",4.79523,34028,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/df/3c/49/df3c4997-47e0-ec77-5c41-3f4f93ba2e5b/b76f7f94-8ef8-4cbc-877f-528996bfdf4d_ASO-48_StoreScreens_iPhone5.5_Screen2_GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b2/16/2c/b2162c98-6262-20b1-fe6e-76d96cee0d50/0e7817f0-54cb-4e48-9391-69ddea382166_ASO-48_StoreScreens_iPhone5.5_Screen3_GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/13/ce/b4/13ceb40e-0165-39f8-f486-3141eb60546b/f21f47c4-c0f9-4e6d-a40d-1ac4cfa02c63_ASO-67_Screenshots_Car_Rental_Couple_iPhone5.5_Phase1_Original.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e7/49/57/e74957ef-6b49-bbf1-ccf8-290705162f85/45bd9af0-725b-44b2-b0c5-cb086922cf09_ASO-28_StoreScreens_iPhone5.5_Family_Option_1_US.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/cc/45/60/cc45603f-26e7-30c3-bf47-8a1d8c3bb63f/d2b23bfb-b586-4a81-802e-d5ec3ae3836b_ASO-54_FlightsScreenshot_ML_iPhone5.5_Family_US.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/39/8c/5c/398c5ca4-9b27-5192-56d9-155baf79e1ab/0d90a188-8590-4705-871f-02ecd1b39f90_ASO-48_StoreScreens_iPhone5.5_Screen4_GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3c/51/84/3c518418-4ae4-0204-1939-198c000986b4/fc925d0a-5adf-4051-a945-9d84dae14c6f_ASO-48_StoreScreens_iPhone5.5_Screen5_GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b8/27/fa/b827fa04-9f18-163a-590d-c27e3b7d0daa/e6386151-d643-42a6-903c-18956e7d9bc9_ASO-48_StoreScreens_iPad_Screen2_GB.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/05/ec/d0/05ecd082-5e25-1a83-c65e-1fc81d92909b/cb0cb776-43b4-4a05-ad3d-8dda43b54bc1_ASO-48_StoreScreens_iPad_Screen3_GB.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/89/5d/ba/895dba3c-c1ff-6a07-080c-f247bcacec05/72970bc1-6ba2-407a-8bdb-76d04e5eb620_ASO-48_StoreScreens_iPad_Screen4_GB.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/b2/dd/3e/b2dd3eb5-a969-ba6b-0881-953425fa6cec/1b75f705-17f0-4314-9f7c-b696122becdd_ASO-67_Screenshots_Car_Rental_Couple_iPad_Phase1_Original.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/cc/bc/c9/ccbcc9e9-2742-09ff-dadd-acf0fdd3a221/fa4f2261-8609-4bdc-a04d-0ec6736c68f9_ASO-54_FlightsScreenshot_ML_iPad_Family_US.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/de/16/f7/de16f7ad-7554-9b64-7125-dd6b21143bfc/f73207c1-7c18-4451-8c81-ea8f19aac203_ASO-48_StoreScreens_iPad_Screen5_GB.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneS

I can not pay attention like I do with your new voice guidance. Boy band was funny, kept you awake and alert while driving. Please! | Decent app, used to like it before 12 cracked it. Do not use waze in atlanta GA you will regret it. | WAZE can no longer be trusted. Google made sure of that. An update is supposed to improve not hinder the operation of the app … which Google has failed to comprehend or ...   Google Maps have been wrong more than they have been right in my experience. WAZE NEVER took me down a narrow road that led to a dead end in the middle of nowhere! That’s why I got WAZE. And in my honest opinion that was probably why the WAZE program was written, because Google couldn’t deliver.  And they don’t like fun!! All the avatars are gone! How can it be real time time if can’t report safely? Google is purposely killing WAZE in my opinion by making it harder to report safely as in ‘use the app as intended’ by requiring more time and ATTENTION to operate therefore rendering the original intent of the app useless. JMHO 😢 | I like a lot of things about this app however I hate at the same time and end up not using cause if the phone is connected to my car once I add the address it doesn’t give me options to see routes available it just starts the navigation straight away and if I want to see the route I need to disconnect the phone while I am lost and driving and it’s very annoying, on the top off that when I disconnect from the car and  stop the navigation to see the route it immediately erase the address and I have to type all again or reselect the address that sometimes save on history sometimes not… once again all that nightmare while I am driving!! It would be a better app if it would do like google does! | I like that Waze updates me on police officers and some traffic patterns. But it is extremely dangerous. It changes your patterns while driving shaving one minute off is not really doing me any help and pulling me through 300 additional stops again is not a fair option to choose from

Now, when ask me to change Rt, I had to do it on my car screen instead of my phone, which is even more dangerous and I can’t figure out the Rt pattern.

I wish there was an option to stop getting routed through neighborhoods. I don’t want 368. Turns the mental stress and load of that is 10 times worse than just sitting on the highway. For example, no way routing me through downtown Atlanta was better than keeping me on 285 and taking me straight to Smyrna.. Grammatical errors using voice to text | Traveling from Louisiana to Washington, got to the border of New Mexico and Colorado in Raton, when we pulled off to get food. We were traveling north with no issues. Tried to get back on the road and Waze directed us to start traveling south. I noticed pretty fast since all the signs said South I-25, and we turned around, but Waze continued to say we needed to make a uturn and head south. Our eta changed from 8:20pm before the stop to 10pm after. Since it kept telling us to do a compete 180°, I decided to pull up Apple Maps to get directions and when I did it put us on the correct route with the eta being 8:33. So not only was it the complete wrong way and had us backtracking, it wouldn’t have even got us there faster but 1 and 1/2 hours later. This app is defunked if it can’t give the right directions, especially if other apps have the same reporting features as this one now. | Been using App for years; had many destinations saved, routes, drives, narrator voices; now, suddenly, with no warning, for no reason, all that info is gone, and I have to start over like the first day!
So disappointed! | Waze has helped me avoid traffic numerous times, but whenever I can’t avoid it, I add time to my ETA. The app always underestimates how much time you will spend in traffic. | 𝕀𝕥'𝕤 𝕛𝕦𝕤𝕥 𝕘𝕠𝕠𝕕 𝕞𝕪 𝕗𝕣𝕚𝕖𝕟𝕕𝕤 𝕒𝕝𝕤𝕠 𝕝𝕠𝕧𝕖 𝕚𝕥 ♡❥❢♥︎ᜊ | It’s so bad | I use the Waze app while traveling for business but my major issue is that it doesn’t give you a heads up as to what’s coming… for example, it would be helpful if the app was able to say “at the night light take a right” OR when I’m about to take and exit let me know what lane to be in before I actually exit, something like “exit right and stay in the left lane” this way I don’t exit right and it’s a split exit with 2 routes to go and I got in the wrong lane which has happened.

I know the screen shows it but what if you can’t look at the screen because it’s heavy traffic? 

Just a recommendation. | Waze is one of those rare apps that i will go out of my way to write a review for. This app has saved from about 35 speeding tickets at this point and it’s the first thing i throw on when i drive. The routes are always efficient and the traffic data seems to be almost as accurate as google maps! I would say the only downside is the battery draw on your phone but if you have a charger and are using carplay, there is nothing to complain about. Would love to be able to mark hazards for other wazers from the other side of the road though! | The “where to” disappears too quick when opening the app. | This app was awesome before the last update. The voice alerts for speed traps and red light cameras was great. Since the update, this feature is no longer available. Also, the app accesses your location even when you’re not using it. Please change everything back to how it was before this AWFUL update. | Waze stays open on my phone after I leave my car for some reason. I have to open it then close it to exit the app. If not caught it will drain battery | I have used Waze for years but finally had to delete this app because it requires location tracking to be enable and actually running at all times.   The only workaround is to disable location services whenever the app is not being used.   Its a shame because its otherwise a great app. | Had iPhone 7, worked great with CarPlay. Was a 5 star app. Upgraded to iPhone 15. Can’t report hazards, hazards aren’t announced, can’t get directions, it’s totally useless now. I’ve tried uninstalling it, reinstalling it. Forgetting device on CarPlay, etc. can’t find information on user forums. | I enjoy the accuracy of the app I only wish that when you are arriving at your location, it will actually show the address and a picture of the location. For example, your destination is on the left or the right it literally just drops a pin in the middle of the block and it doesn’t show you that you’ve arrived at said address it just tells you you’ve arrived, there is no picture there is no address of which you put in. I use Waze a lot with Uber and it never gives me the final destination. I always have to switch over to Uber to see where the house is. | Fix this asap. | Apple Car Play - Intermittent operation tried everything still working intermittently….. | Actualice mi IOS y simplemente no lo he podido usar me no muestra el kilometraje pido direccion pero se vuelve loco y me lleva a otra ubicacion. Si voy por una calle me muestra q voy por otra. Asi q ya no la uso | Unable to find gps coordinates | The new update basically accused me of lying about my age and showed jokes like “wow a 2 year old driving a car!”! I don’t recall ever being asked to set it. But even if I set it wrong, being rude is not okat | I love this app 1 of the best I done download to navigate ❤️ | Waze used to be good. It would direct people around traffic via back roads, finding better routes for all. But now so many go down back roads that it just clogs everything up, and Waze doesn’t recognize how bad they are. Waze sent  us to backroads for a merge, insisting it would get us there quicker, just a few minutes of traffic this way.

We’ve been sitting in this traffic an hour, barely moving, debating a much longer route but no, Waze insisted we press on, that it was about to get better. It has not. Waze’s predictions are useless. | Sound no longer working, did all basic troubleshooting, reinstalled the app and updated to iOS 16.7 with no luck. | I used to love this app.  Best gps out there, for a little while.  Seems to me anymore that people just place hazards for the fun of it.  I’ve seen countless times where I would say something was no longer there, and the pin remains.  Especially when it’s police.  And how in the world do you get rid of the stupid elf voice??? Even when I check all notifications and setting, somehow that dude still speaks to me.  It’s like nails on a chalkboard. | Waze now cannot even navigate to contacts in the phone, making it a pain to use if intending to use it as a GPS (the very thing it’s meant for).
Routing no longer allows simple reporting of street closures, so instead circles you back to try to force impossible turns.

It even tries to route you to things on the other side of a bay (Seattle area) rather than ones nearly to include ones along the current route. This is made worse since technically something being 16 miles away (but across the bay, so requiring about an hour to get to), shouldn’t be shown in lue of locations about 3 miles away.

It still has the benefit of fun voice options, and viewing other users on the map.p | Such a cute app it helps me get places quickly and gives me the best routes tells me if there’s an accident or any slow traffic. The kiddos entertain on car rides just watching little Waze characters. and have some low battery draining, but just keep it plugged in and you’ll be good. This is a very good family map app and I definitely recommend it to every person young or old. | Waze used to be very accurate for commute times. Now it seems to consistently give optimistic estimations. I’d vastly prefer a realistic take than something that tends to get me there in 20-50% more time than it said it would. | I love this app it’s got good stuff but I wood suggest to put wiring Like there is cameras on the lights so that the person that is behind would respect if not then they should be a police man giving tickets | Constantly puts be in the wrong lane trying to avoid traffic in the dmv are. Ends up making me later than if I had just gone through traffic. | Waze, I like your map. I use all the time. I noticed that the speed limit is not showing while using Apple car play. Can you please correct this issue? I would be awe so grateful. Thank you😁 | Love this app! Would love to see a school icon because think of how many people use this app driving their kids to school. Thanks! | I got Waze a little over 4 years ago and have been using it ever since. I personally find this app easier to use and read than other GPS apps. I love this app for many reasons but let’s be real, the real reason is having Master Chief as my GPS voice. I hope they never stop having Master Chief as a voice option, it’s just too perfect! | Works incredibly well in open spaces, but where I live in Boston, it is remarkably frustrating because under the tunnels, it will lose reception. Also, when looking for larger areas, it will use the map directions, but it won’t use the directions as to where a person can actually drive into the complex or area.it has lost me multiple times with regards to larger parks or golf courses where it will bring me to the course, but not to the actual entrance of the course so I am driving around aimlessly looking for where I can enter. | It has a lot to improve its keep giving long ways and most stupid routes even tho i do not accept change in the route it keeps taking me the way it wants | Why does my Waze suddenly start speaking to me in another language? I can’t tell if it’s Greek or Spanish.  
I do love the colors of the map on the new update however. | Has been the best, most useful, and easiest to use navigation app available. Lately, however, it has become very buggy. It seems to have started when they were bought out by Google. Perhaps they are just getting rid of the competition by abandoning it, because it has problems running on Apple Car Play. 1/2 of the time the map shows, but won’t show a route, you can’t interact with it on the car’s touch screen display, and it won’t go into dark mode. Sometimes it’s just a blank screen until you shut the car off and restart it. I don’t want to use Google Maps or even Apple Maps, but often, I don’t have a choice because Waze won’t work. Update: Just as soon as it started working again, they updated and totally ruined the app. Don't know why developers destroy apps with updates that completely change it. With this update, they have pretty much eliminated users reporting incidents, police, objects on road, etc. Because now, instead of two screen taps to report, it now takes at least three and sometimes four. which is not safe to do while driving. I'm not reporting anymore because they have made it more time consuming and cumbersome. I know many users will also stop because of this, which eliminates the feature that set Waze apart from Google or Apple maps.
They also got rid of the on screen speed limit signs, which is another negative change making the app not worth using anymore. | Has not been working since updating to ios17 | Mostly useful for looking at real time traffic conditions and routes  around them well. 

Comes up short on logical routes in denser areas, routing into heavy traffic vs around it. 

Use as a reference but also review routes and make own judgement calls. | The new update makes it extremely difficult to find saved destinations.  It also don’t show my calendar appointments and desertions anymore. The app version is the current update located on Apple Store and my iPhone is running iOS version 17.4. 

The new App update also won’t give in-app access to Amazon Music anymore. It only allows Apple Music. Before update I was able to chose Amazon Music as my Waze in-app Music. The update removed it and now I can’t choose. | Since update I cannot get Waze into dark mode during the day like I used to be able to do. Yes my cell is selected dark mode on the cell. Connect to the car screen goes in light mode. Thermos NO selections in setup on the car navigation screen or anywhere else in car setup to go to dark screen. This only happened after update. I uninstalled Waze re download Waze fresh reinstall. Connected and same results. What is weird is on my my wife’s car screen she also couldn’t go into dark mode. Was like this for several days or weeks then all of a sudden while she was driving in the day time Waze switched to dark mode. We both have the same make of vehicles hers 23 camera, me Tacoma 22. I don’t understand how hers finally all by it self went into dark mode as she and I both prefer. I’m giving it a few more days and if Waze doesn’t change will be deleted. | Not by tap shows alternative route as used to be 
Once click that  only one route ! Pleaee fix this 
Used to show local and fast   So pleaee fix this thanks | I gave this app one star and here’s why. I’ve used Waze for years and for a long time it was invaluable to me. I drive a lot and I mean a lot for work in city traffic and up until recently Waze had an option where you could see alternative routes while you were already navigating. This was what made Waze really work for me. Driving in a city there are multiple ways you can go. Waze will always send you the shortest time route. But sometimes that route makes you cross over four lanes of traffic without a stoplight and other things like that. So when I can search other ways to go, sometimes it is worth one extra minute for my safety or less stress, but I can no longer do that because Waze took away that ability. Until they put it back as someone who drives all the time it doesn’t work for me anymore. I am very disappointed. For the record, Waze still gives you alternative routes but only when you first put in your location so if I wanted to see an alternative route, I would have to completely close out the app and reopen it and put in the address again which is just not safe or possible when you’re driving | Love the app. The newest update, however, has the navigation not giving all information. It will say “in 1 mile.” But never say what to do anymore. | I personally love this app I use it every day when driving has saved me countless times from getting a ticket I know that it has a high battery drain but that’s why you keep your phone plugged into your port in your car to avoid all that glad to see the report police on the other side icon has come back. Happy about that overall this app like I said has saved my butt many times over have been using this app since it first came out and will be using it until something better or this app is replaced. Either way it goes I’m a loyal Waze user. | I wish like Google you can drive while having it in satellite view. It’s good for DoorDash because you can see exactly the house you need to go to and it be outlined by the address. | Recientemente quitaron la visualización de rutas alternas mientras conducimos, lo cual nos ayudaba muchísimo para evadir tránsito denso. Necesitamos lo vuelvan a poner, ya que en su lugar pusieron compartir trayecto, que no todos  necesitamos este dato, pero si las rutas alternas | Your bug reporting is not intuitive. With Apple CarPlay, Waze often has to be opened on the phone and then swiped closed / force closed and restarted in order for the mph and speed limit to reappear on the map. Please fix and thank you.",4.80441,30446,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/5b/c9/a9/5bc9a9bc-a950-2318-c5f0-cde4e336b4bc/8a99ba1c-50e1-4521-bef6-8140db5a9936_Screen_01_Pothole_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ad/cc/14/adcc147a-9629-098a-b90f-9b0a14721ebf/14a15076-4aaa-4b60-839f-4cd9017369bf_Screen_02_Reporting_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a7/21/91/a72191c3-c6b7-4691-7603-21e95a94a4ab/55d76f58-7815-4761-9c38-7e9cb759d817_Screen_03_Reroute_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/80/a4/a9/80a4a938-3bd7-c65a-13e4-c1f6fb2d65cf/41eb45b9-3493-48e0-ae68-95c73de0f2a6_Screen_04_Speed_Camera_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ad/e6/af/ade6af1e-31e9-856d-1204-ef0d622a9b54/2f5bba53-5e4c-4f47-9b4d-b73ca9177305_Screen_05_CYD_English_5.5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3b/be/4a/3bbe4abc-5994-bc3f-a81a-a7f1c458c0cc/a60ae708-2520-47d0-bbb5-ea55605b121c_01-POTHOLE_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/01/1c/60/011c602b-a7a9-15bf-fa0b-2498a48e62a9/8f7fd96d-60cd-4415-aa5c-d4df8344d960_02-REPORTING_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/75/6b/ec/756bec5a-78df-7348-35b2-1e00740d6c23/d406f30c-6490-4323-8810-525a3d0046e4_03-REROUTE_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f4/87/73/f48773bb-864a-ea1c-018e-2b306c1c4764/86b99d5d-7a60-4ed1-b158-118e40c46dc3_04-SPEED_CAMERA_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4f/6e/86/4f6e860c-9f97-8902-15b7-51bb638353a0/5660ff26-0421-488a-9b67-95ade4ef805f_05-COPILOT_ENGLISH.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Wow great! Well - not too much - I am in different time zone - is your customer support awake ? Hardly at work now. And - do you already accept calling via data? Whatsapp or Signal (even better)?

this ordering application works somewhat well however...

Alza the company provides no competent human service for faulty products, refunds, or returns.

The problem then becomes solely the customers responsibility.

They do not use or respond to telephones, nor have any inter-office communications. It then becomes a ""Kafka-esque"" rabbit hole of burecratic denial and web based complaint forms.

No formal EU level customer support training for staff yet.

While the purchasing process has been simplified, customer support is then passed along to the manufacturer, and this retailer will not be concerned with solving or processing your concerns.

A narrow profit margin requires a narrow business plan to encourage return customers.

Will not be returning to use this application or support this company.

Keep trying Alza. Improvements  do not qualify success.

Customer satisfaction should be your ONLY objective.

It's been like this for YEARS. How is this still a thing?!?! | App does not allow you to store your cards in Apple Wallet. | Need an update to work for Iphone 15 models! | Would not open. Got a “preparing” message followed by “try again later.” Didn’t work later either | I’ve been looking for an app that keeps everything in one place like this one. I’ve downloaded and tested out a few others from competitors and I was impressed by how user-friendly it is. I also enjoyed the features like the Card Assistant option. 

I would love to see an option in the future to have the ability to organize by categories (dining, gym, frequent flyer, etc). I also would enjoy having the ability to add all my gift cards. I really am looking for an all-in-one app for my entire wallet.

It still gets 5 stars because it delivers as promoted and already surpasses Apple Wallet. | In my opinion, this app works well for me. I don’t have to carry cards in my wallet and I can access them from my phone. My only complaint would be that after the last update, the widget shows very small stores logos. If you open the app, the “recently used” section show larger logos and it was the way they were on the widget before the last update. Hopefully it will be addressed soon. Very difficult to see them. | Panda Express has just started it's loyalty system and when I added into the Stocard app, it has not shown up so I had to make a generic card and the color looks tacky. Please fix it. 

And also, because it's on Apple Wallet, please change the logo on the Wallet app. | Totally SUCKS😡😡😡👎👎👎 | This app is easy.  I have all my shopping cards stored pull them up and at the grocery store they scan it or BJs.  Etc. | Used this for a few years and was pretty happy until latest updates. Since a recent update, the app hangs on start and doesn’t show my cards when I have poor mobile reception. My local grocery store is such a place, so I annoyingly have to disable mobile data just to get to my card. Unclear what is so important to retrieve from the network when all my cards are already stored locally. | I don’t understand why the widget in iOS 17 is so small. The widget in the pro version of the store card before it was updated was fairly good-sized and easy to see. Macy Minor, but I use my widget a lot, and now it’s just really hard to use. | New version just displays a black screen for several minutes. | From day 1, Stocard has proved invaluable. No longer need to worry about forgetting a card, fumbling for and through wallet to find the relevant card. With Stocard, all of my scores of loyalty cards are available easily and instantly. Where before the act of pulling out and scanning my loyalty card sometimes meant I didn’t use the card as intended, with Stocard, it makes scanning my loyalty cards so fast and simple am able to use them every time. The app is very easy to use. Highly recommend as an essential app. | Version 10.25.0 when you first open the app it’s blank you have to close it and reopen it same thing with the widget. Hope that can be fixed soon. | Easy to use and don’t have to worry about not having a card or fumbling around trying to find the right one. | Great app to store cards in one place! Recommended by the YMCA, glad I got Stocard. | 1/2024 It seems you now require location ALWAYS on to use the assistant and took away the feature to search for cards. You need to change the location tracking to WHILE USING APP. This is a big violation of user privacy - MY privacy. Please change this asap and add search feature back! The app is not useful as is and is too intrusive to privacy. | Deleting a card makes me nervous because you’ll lose all the information of the card. Sometimes you may need to track back your transactions or double check if there’s still balance on it. | Each update is slower, bigger, more ugly, and more cluttered. Tons of added, useless features that no one asked to have, in updates for the past three years. Bring back the original Stocard app! 

The pink icon is disgusting and I will never update until it’s restored to red. Also, they don’t answer customer service emails for a while. | Зачем надо было удалять из Русского App store???? Но прога норм пользуюсь с 2020 | This app is perfect. You can make your wallet all digital because you add any card to this app. You can use your cards on your Apple Watch too. | So easy to have all my membership cards all in one place and not have a stack of them in my wallet. | This app is very user friendly. It gets the job done in the accurate amount of time and I never have to searching for the cards! | Спасибо за приложение. Это лучшее приложение среди всех конкурентов! 
Пожалуйста, добавьте возможность сортировать и расставлять карты по порядку вручную! 
Пользователь сам расставит карты по порядку, в котором он привык, а в магазине сработает мышечная память при поиске нужной карты. Это в разы удобнее, нежели алфавитный список карт, или постоянно меняющийся список в зависимости от использования | I just updated my Apple Watch to WatchOS 10 and I cannot add this app to smart stacks. If I can’t quickly access this app on my watch while I’m at the check out counter I will likely stop using it. | I’ve been using this on my phone and watch for years, and it never fails me. Great app. | البرنامج جميل وتحفظ فية مستنداتك وسهولة الرجوع لها ولكن نحتاج لوحة تحكم للمستخدم اكثر مرونة  وخصائص اكثر | I enjoy the convenience of having my cards stored on this app. What I don’t like is having ads for companies that I don’t have cards for, especially companies that I have never heard of and only have stores on the opposite side of the country from where I live. | No option to add cards in Stocard to Apple Wallet. Seems like this was a feature in the past but was removed? | I used to use this from day one when it was originally released. It was great. But these days I find support non existent. 

Membership cards have changed formats over years. Never receive assistance for updating formats.

Advertising specials imho just made this simple great app a bloated mess. | This App allows you to add any store, gym, library, medical facility etc card with a barcode. The app also is Apple Watch available so can be scanned from wrist without having to use phone or digging for card in wallet/purse/key chain. In addition , if you use complications on Apple Watch, can add app to face. Along with Apple Pay, can manage both transactions directly from wrist. | I use my watch to scan in at the gym. Please add the feature to have a Smart Stack widget for quick access to barcodes on the Apple Watch. This would be a great timesaver from having to scroll through the apps to access like when the watch had the Dock feature previously. | Needs to support the new smartstack widgets for WatchOS 10 for quick and easy access | Men | I have been used this card app years I love it easy and convenient I never had a problem this is my app friend helps me keep my shopping cards neatly thank you | Really nice app. Stores all of my cards, even photoed logos for the ones not on the list making them much easier to find. Wish all of the suggested companies advertised on top of screen applied to me and were available in my neighborhood. They do have to pay the bills. Thanks for a great app. | Great app. I use barcodes and QR codes for my job that isn’t grocery and it scans and saves a copy of just about any barcode. | So easy to use and keeps all my cards in order. So convenient ! Love it! Everyone must have! | I love this app, it scanned all my membership cards and sorte rewards ones too in a breeze without having to take picture of the front card.’d love their logo to stand out as when looking for it, I can never find it. The logo is to me really bad looking too! It is for this reason only I give 4 stars and not 5. | Lost all my previous card setups!!!!’ | They send me ads that don’t pertain to me or my area. Example: Food King, I don’t have a good king within a 100 miles of me. They send me ads for women’s makeup. I don’t use makeup! | Costco will not accept scanning the card on this app. | Good app 
Definitely accurate and very helpful 
!!! | Got rid of the bulk - thanks!

ETA: it’s been YEARS since I started using this app. I love it so much! I have my grandmothers Weis card loaded in here, & she has since passed. Sounds dumb but this app does its part in helping keep her memory alive; I think about her every time I use it. | Not all apps scan tho other than that a great idea | This is a great option for all of my store cards that are not recognized by Apple Wallet. | Sto card is a great way to keep your name tags and cards and I love how you can scan and I can even add my school id | Very disappointed that Stocard doesn’t seem to work on the watch. The barcodes are so small scanners can’t read them, and the screen does not brighten. | Unwanted ads, notifications and features. No way to disable spam features. Looking for a more minimal replacement. | nice",4.83633,13185,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/2f/7e/9c/2f7e9ccc-a929-6c51-ede2-fbb4f2aa5da0/46158c52-cf12-4af1-99b4-1fa73246fccc_iPhone_6s_Plus_U002c_iPhone_7_Plus_U002c__U2028iPhone_8_Plus_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/2e/b6/70/2eb67042-e9b6-0514-bd67-514d9e456fcc/9a0134cc-b4a4-4a03-8e9f-84571ef3c64e_iPhone_6s_Plus_U002c_iPhone_7_Plus_U002c__U2028iPhone_8_Plus_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/f5/1b/ef/f51bef76-60d0-bf81-9129-f5194f8cf716/61f992e4-4daf-4071-a9c5-4005fc118662_iPhone_6s_Plus_U002c_iPhone_7_Plus_U002c__U2028iPhone_8_Plus_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e0/4b/ce/e04bce3c-f2ac-c1ae-a872-06d50c0252fa/32446dc5-781e-4261-bd97-d8156b75d05b_iPhone_6s_Plus_U002c_iPhone_7_Plus_U002c__U2028iPhone_8_Plus_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/5f/7b/fa/5f7bfadd-e7c4-7cef-fe67-76b6df9ae1a4/2ffd8c25-8701-4927-841a-5d515c2d191a_iPhone_6s_Plus_U002c_iPhone_7_Plus_U002c__U2028iPhone_8_Plus_5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

When I delete photos from my iPhone, they are automatically deleted from Google photos.  I though the whole purpose was for cloud storage.

So I’ve always had to buy extra storage. Not anymore! Now I can move all my pictures to google photos & remove them from my photos to clear up space! I also really like how they do memories. And all the other features like stacking duplicates & such. | Love having all of my photos in one place! | Always easy to navigate to the photos I am looking for… Thanks | Love it all tha memories an tha help they provide us wit this app I love it | Exactly what I’m looking for | I absolutely love my Google Photos

It is very reliable and problem free | Templates | Works great always has | I can upload all my photos here and then delete them on my camera roll :) | This app is cool | I love using this Drive.  I can find all my special saves from emails, google, messages, and messenger. 

This is user friendly and easy to find what I am looking for.  

I love that I can share my important saves with my family and friends. | Good job | Demasiado | I have to execute two-step verification every time I access Google Drive on my smart phone. Then the app opens to a generic location and not the location where my hyperlink directed. Also, I can conveniently see the names of all the folders. Is that the date the folder was created or is that the date The latest file was placed in the folder? Whatever, it’s unnecessary at best and misleading at worst. | Always telling me video is still processing after several hours 😐 | Gran equipo de trabajo | Great way to save your files. | Me encanta la energía con la transmite su talento y sobretodo el conocimiento que tiene para ofrecer me encanta 🙌😁 | I don’t know if Google is doing it intentionally for Apple devices, but the app got so much slower and buggier recently. It takes about 30 SECONDS for the app to open a link (given it’s on high speed Wi-Fi network. Slower networks make it even longer).
Overall, using the website version is much quicker and easier at this point. A shame. | I’m trying to send a simple audio file to my phone and it won’t save just keeps reading error. Also if I press save on an audio file I text myself it does t do anything. | I like the app and now I will learn how to use it. Thanks | Floating buttons block the files 3 dots menu button. The “convenient” + and scan buttons are terribly inconvenient to me. They only work around I’ve found so far is to go through the steps of opening the document and then clicking on the menu button from inside the document.

Floating buttons usually block other elements of the UI. This is a design trend I really hope dies.

The + and scan buttons should really be part of the bottom bar if they are that important to have on display. | They literally let me accumulate photos in storage over 20 years and then one day started blocking me from accessing all of my photos and saved documents and put notices on my email account, my google photos, and my google drive saying that if I want my stuff back I have to pay to get it! That’s sooo messed up!! What a corrupt way to handle business! | Super easy to use! Easy to keep files together! | Google Drive is super easy to navigate! | No, I do not want to sign in to google account everywhere I go

Update: quit being evil | I do | There’s nothing that’s “blowing my mind” about Good Drive, but that’s what I love about it. 
I use multiple operating systems across many different devices in my line of work, and Drive is a consistent place to store and pull information as needed wherever I’m at or trying to do. 
Virtual organization is such a hassle for a lot of people, myself included. So I know how easily things can seem overwhelming and incredibly stressful having many types of Documents, Resumes, Presentations, Media, (and countless other things), coming in from work, as well as personal life. And this has been a great way for me to easily organize and access anything in the proper way, and most importantly I feel it’s secure, and you have many options on how you would like to share anything you may have. It’s worth getting, and also worth the extra effort in making the switch from a current app or system you use to Google Drive. It’s consistent, the prices are fair and reasonable, and any “surprise” I have come across has been positive. Am still discovering new and possible things I am able to do on here. Keep up the great work, it’s appreciated! | Drive is my go to file storage and sharing app on iOS devices and my Windows lap top. | Muy buena aplicación no da fallo | Doesn’t work well enough to be considered usable on IOS. Can’t select multiple files at once, most I the time newly uploaded files aren’t there for hours, downloads are slow. At least pretend you don’t make your app unusable for competing operating systems | This is a great little app, access to external storage on the go.  I’d only like to see a feature make music play in a friendlier format like adding repeat or make a playlist but it’s still a very good app. | I didn’t even know these are here !
I’m so glad they’re safe here
Sincerely, Monique | This app used to be great, now it barely ever loads the files, it stays in a perpetual spin. Before this it was 5 stars, now it's virtually unusable. Good luck finding support. | Great for my schooling | Tarda mucho en procesar videos cortos de 1 min ó menos de 100 MB, porqué ??? En Amazon Drive y otros es en minutos y aqui tarda varios días, la verdad no es una solución así, estaría bién arreglar eso | This used to be perfect. The best storage system by far. I use it for everything. Now it just loads forever. It’s a useless app on my phone. I have to use the web site on my phone browser. I might start looking for another solution. I don’t have time to fight an app that I need to just work

Edit: at the developer advice, I deleted and reinstalled the app. It’s still slow but working for now. | I can watch T&H lessons | Stop asking for revision I do one thing nice  and you start blocking my opening of my photos.  
                    I don’t have time for this.
                     Please Stop | It is a great app | Seems weird | This is one of the worst thing I have ever downloaded prosessing videos takes forever! | Don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this Google update?  Linkage is certainly not clear! | Très bien | iPhone 15 pro max. Doesn’t load files. 12 year user on android with no major problems. Made the switch and now this…death spin, the google way | it drains the battery even when I don't open the app and have background app refresh disabled for it | User interface is not graphically appealing as other similar functions | Love how google drive is designed and dependable. | Very disappointed with the complexity of something that should be easily accessible to everyone to navigate! | Good, laggy | Awesome photographer and pictures | So many files just don’t show up in drive no matter what. Even if I just edited it on my computer. Even if I can find it in the browser version on my phone. It just won’t show up in the app or search. It’s so frustrating | I miss you too baby miss miss you miss miss baby miss miss you | But give us 50g of free storage instead of 15 :( | It is a really good app it helps me do my school work at home. 5 out of 5",4.74838,49004,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/c2/96/d0/c296d03a-0d9e-7077-af5c-97b0f1f931fb/mzl.nbfcadje.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/91/78/7d/91787d79-b4d7-7ed8-2ec5-639a4096435e/mzl.tijeehhm.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/13/e9/ee/13e9ee67-99e1-2291-3244-4b54f514b03d/mzl.ognbpgrz.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/5b/11/3a/5b113a4e-b4c5-04f8-bbc2-dd0eb46e7824/mzl.qeuoines.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/a5/32/8b/a5328b95-8fca-d400-8e16-ce43af38ac08/mzl.sngnsjnt.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/99/48/3b/99483b5f-ea01-a37a-336a-d93b82c1f77f/545496d9-82bf-4ec2-8464-a814dc6436a2_01.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/17/c7/b5/17c7b533-b77a-3a11-32e1-37a7fd05f104/8c1b778c-87b5-4f9a-bf36-a652c6b3ffc8_Drive_EN-US_iPad_2ndGen_SecureScreenshot.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/6c/7a/a3/6c7aa303-808d-bafb-e0e1-7a34178d6cfb/2a5b902b-6f58-44a6-9060-e0793afb6064_02.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e6/5e/d0/e65ed0b1-58b6-8e3a-f21c-a50380791590/06c134b8-ff7e-4915-abd0-34acd477dab7_03.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0f/f4/8a/0ff48a74-473a-b303-6a9a-063b8d7628a8/76ec65ea-ef2d-48c9-a736-cd5a415de0d3_04.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/4c/e7/86/4ce786c6-d46f-9adf-bf49-9d8e65bf77f2/7fe3637d-9fea-47c2-9438-7d1d37ba851d_05.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I love it. Shazam App the best !!! | Love Shazam | This is a great app when you're sitting in a restaurant and you don't know the name of a song! | Rápido y certero | So many songs I hear that either can’t remember or have never heard and want to know the titles and artists….one TAP will do it!!! Thank you. Way back music !!!!🎶🎶🎶🎶BRAVO!!! | Love love love it. I use it everyday. So that way you don’t have to bug anybody and ask them what song it is. | Always on point!!! Great job. | Hi | Has always worked for many years, then updated app to newest version and entire app will no longer work. No songs identified. Microphone under settings is on. App has been redownloaded, device turned on & off. App no longer works on any devices. | Best app ever | Absolutely lov it…found amazing spunds | Always there when I need it! Thanks! | The best app ever | Awesome 🤩 | Finds me all the songs I need! | Totally Awesome | If I think about all the apps Iv had since my first smart phone the Galaxy 3 | This app never ceases to amaze me. | This is amazing I love it, it helps me find out what the music is for in the trend’s lately. Thanks Shazam! | Shazam could not identify music playing in Apple Music. And that says a lot in that Apple owns both software applications. Does Apple care if their own overlapping software even talks to each other I wonder? This is not seamless with either iTunes music nor Apple Music. And although it will identify music, it will only show up in Apple Music and not in iTunes music. So you are unable to purchase it. And they are unable to recommend music based upon what I have Shazam'd. I would have expected better integration with other Apple software. That is why you should save to Spotify as they give you better recommendations. Then use Spotify to search for like music. Spotify does a fantastic job at that. | Lately I’ve been Shazaming songs and the device is clear especially if I understand what the artist is singing but Shazam can’t seem to identify the songs. One song was wrong three times. I don’t know the name of the song, that’s why I’m Shazaming it. Is something going on with Shazam? Tweet it please | If I could marry a piece of technology, it would be this app! I am in love with this app! | I downloaded this after the iOS embedded version failed. I tried multiple ‘listens” to the same song and it came up with different songs each time! None were correct! | Es demasiado practica y fácil de utilizar me encanta esta aplicación | Love using the app. Can find any songs and in any language. Get results within seconds. So so useful. I literally use this any place around the world !! | This is the best music identity. | Absolutely amazing | It’s always so cool to be able to identify music from my past and enjoy it. Shazam makes it easy! | Thank you | Love it.!!  Always a touch to find information on a song, then download. Best thing ever !!!! | I have been listening to a song for months but I needed to fine the name to it and you helped | Use it all the time | I have used Shazam for many years and hardly came up repetitive failures if it to finds songs. In the last several months, this is the norm. Out of ten songs I could say lately Shazam finds 3 and these are usually known artists. It may have to do with the original company being bought out if I recall and hence the app quality is dropping which is sad. | 009 | This app it tells you the correct songs and I just love it because I don’t have to know the lyrics to song to know what song it is and I love having not to do that because when I have to look up the lyrics to song it gets super annoying and this is so easy. I just click on the Shazam app and then I get my song, sad some of my favorite and like if it’s playing on my bus in my car in the mall I want to know what song is playing if it’s good and if I don’t know what song is, it’s gonna really annoy me for the rest of it, and this really has helped me to get the right songs | Use it all the time for different bars playing music I haven’t heard in years to get the artist. | Has saved my life! It is my best friend at times and gives me song ideas and suggestions about what to listen to. | Totally the GAME CHANGER | I am enjoying this so very much it used to play the entire song I don’t like the Google connection WHY YOU WERE BETTER W/O IT PLEASE RECONSIDER
WE LOVE YOU STOP ALL THIS INVASION OF PRIVACY WE JUST WANT TO ENJOY MUSIC
PLEASE | Shazam used to be great, but recently has terrible accuracy when identifying house, trance and techno music.  Very rarely are its matches correct anymore, and I am presented with the same few popular song suggestions over and over again (despite there being little similarities between the song I’m listening to and the song suggested by Shazam).  I consistently report incorrect matches for the last few months, and still no improvement.  Can’t say I recommend this app anymore. | Used to be a great app until apple purchased it. Now it can barely recognize songs and is incorrect quite a bit. | Necessary for life | I have noticed this, after shifting from Android to iOS. The results take a lot of time and sometimes no results. On Android, just a second or two would give accurate results. | In a matter of a second!!  It’s got it😆!!  Drives me crazy when I can’t remember the names of songs, no longer a worry with this awesome app! Also it’s free!! OMG!! Could it be more perfect?!  Thank you developers!! | Maybe for current popular songs, & standards, but Shazam is mediocre for identifying classical or jazz genres. | Definitely one of my favorite apps.  Works every time.  Very handy if you are watching a TV show/movie and hear a song you like.

And thank you again | I would of given this a better review but when say a word in Greek it most of time comes out as a completely different word. I can say word multiple times and might even come out differently every time. Yes I tried to say it slowly or faster still the same. But if type it it does translate it correctly | This app is very helpful and overall a gift. However, there are many text-to-speak options missing for formerly colonised African languages. 

For example they have Igbo, one of many languages spoken in Nigeria, but they do not have text-to-speak options. 

Naturally someone will say that since there are so many languages, Google cannot get the text-to-speech feature for all of them. 

They will also say they hope to get around to it like they have for other African languages, but sadly the countries which once tried to erase the existence of these languages have long since been fully featured on the app.

There seems to be a prioritising of languages which allows some to be fully featured, while others waste away in waiting with hopes of being recognised by the world, though many taste the use of them on their tongues. 

I hope to one day have text-to-speech for Igbo and many other African languages, but I am tempted to think it would be unwise to wait with bated breath. That being said, I still appreciate this remarkable resource. | So I can no longer use Google Translate with my iPhone 7 because of this change.

I jus love that it gives you options for bus stops, tram stops, subways stations, etc. with the name or address you input. When ever there is a delay, the application lets you know. The only thing that I find problematic is that occasionally there are some routes or runnings that have been cancelled (for whatever reason- bus driver sick day, or heavy traffic, or an accident on the road,etc) and this application doesn’t let you know of these extraordinary situations. | No contact phone number 
No way to cancel the ticket 
No explanation 

WILL NEVER BUY TICKETS THROUGH THE APP EVER AGAIN!! What a rip off! | Stellar connection finder for CZ. A way better than google maps or whatever other maps apps that have the feature to look up connections on the market! | I use this app before so I knew that it used to have more functionality, namely that I can even find Polish railways/ trains to Poland, but I don’t know why I can’t search them now, and even the stops have been taken away from the app, can you explain why you developers had made this decision? hope this was just a temporary thing | Na rozdí od konkurence nereflektuje skutečný stav. U vlaků, které například z “provozních důvodů” nejedou, stále píše “bez zpoždění”. Údaje tedy nelze bohužel brát vážně. | IDOS je naprosto skvela sluzba, pouzivam ji kazdy den. | Aplikace je skvělá, má ale jeden zbytečný problém, který ji dělá na některých trasách prakticky nepoužitelnou. Jde o čas na přesun. Ten je pevně daný a připočítává se k času na přestup. Např. mezi trasami metra je přesun 3 minuty, přitom se dá pohodlně stihnout za dvě. Nebo na Nádr. Holešovice je přesun na tramvaj podle aplikace 2 minuty, přitom jedna bohatě stačí.

Kvůli tomu aplikace nenajde spoje, které se dají stihnout.

Navrhuji všechny časy na přesun zkrátit na polovinu. Kdo by to nestíhal, může si nastavit čas na přestup, který je vy výchozím nastavení 2 minuty (já používám 0). | Great app, but would be much better if it worked offline as well! | It’s always worked well for me, been using it a few years now. English version is great, easy to switch back and forth if you want to learn some Czech, too! | They finally brought back English! Thank God!

Prosím o opravu chyby. | Po poslední aktualizaci aplikace přestala zcela fungovat na iOS6! | The best *functioning* app. My only complaint is that it hasn't been updated since Feb 2013.

It doesn’t make since considering not even 1 photo looked like me | UPD! I canceled my subscription on Feb 26th (this time I took a screenshot) and yet I’ve been charged again! on Feb 29th!!! 

I tried free 3 days just to play a bit with AI, I cancelled my subscription right away but for some reason it was renewed with weekly pay of $7.99, I noticed, cancelled subscription again and went back to playing with AI again, since I have another 5 days that I paid for. Waiting time is 99 min instead of 9 min like it was when you do it first time, but when it was done, there was no picture to see, and to make more I required to pay additional $0.99!!! WTH guys??? Don’t subscribe!!! | Paid for the subscription… got one round of photos. Was then asked to pay another $2 for a second round of photos. Paid it, got nothing. Tried again, got asked for another $2. 

And for what it’s worth, the photos are inconsistent. I specified that I am female, and half the photos generated are of men. Every photo looks wildly different as well. | You guys are not transparent about your payment policies. I accept the 3-day free trial, which they said I will be able to use for three days and download unlimited photos. Now I generate 1 batch, the person on the photos looks like me veeery remotely, so I decide to do another one and bam, you ask me for a dollar. You never said there will be a dollar. There’s no place in the app to see what and how you’re going to be charged. People are talking about wait times here in the reviews, but I am subscribed and you have not communicated this to me and I cannot find that info in the app even when I am specifically looking for it. Make this more transparent or you’re going to lose your customers to frustration. | “Oooopsie something went wrong during the generation of your photos” every time I try to use it. | We were waiting 29 min and each time we got oops | U subscribe and then should pay 2$ to see content again. Stupid | It works only sometimes, most of the time it gives errors. Also it says 3 days free trial, but it charged immediately | Put out, but the price is too much! | i got the premium and payed the dollar which said one time purchase to be able to generate same styles and it is still making me pay again… what a rip off | Супер | It doesn’t work. I waited for my photo two hours and they gone missing. | You still need to pay for AI videos even after one time purchase...... | Clunky, takes too long to generate the images and the time estimate isn’t reliable (it was at “1 min left” for about an hour) | I’m waiting for my pictures be ready, already for 2 hrs, it’s showing 1 min fir two hours… 
Also, the previous one that I made haven’t been saved. It’s annoying. | They will make you Caucasian. No diversity in their AI. | Of course there is a paywall for everything and this app is not the exception. The AI generation is not very advanced yet. | It’s a time waster and charges money for everything even after full payment. Stay away or pay if you got extra money to throw | I chose the 3 day free trial, but right when I agreed to the free trial, I got a notification that I was charge $6.99. The photos that were generated were unrealistic as well. | This app had such good features but Making people pay for every thing on the app is just way too greedy in my opinion. Ad revenue should’ve been enough. | Cancel my subscription | Love how your AI looks in videos .. please dont evenr chang format 🖤🖤 | They just keep getting better. 🧨✨ | OMG. Its amazing. I didnt expect such a good result. | I like the app but you have to pay for half of the stuff on the app.But I do like how the app let’s you generate your ideas photos | Paid for pro and only got 1 of the things they do. If I want more services I have to pay more each time | Not free in the slightest. Must pay to open app and explore. Opened app, was asked to pay a subscription, deleted immediately. I don’t know and don’t care what it can do after that. Best to keep looking for another app. Not worth the download. | This app is super fun I highly recommend it. | It limits you to only a few seconds of video, then tells you it could take a while and it will notify you when the video is done. It’s been 24 hours and I still have three videos “processing”.

So I moved onto one photo, it basically digitized, or cartoonized photo, but the body size was so out of proportion it was comical.

And even though I was on a full three day trial, it’s still charged me two dollars for the chemical picture, and one of the videos that still is not even finished rendering.

I suppose it never will, and then my trial will end, and it won’t let me get past the purchase screen. But that part is just a guess. | Samples are cool on the app, but actual videos changed the appearance of my children significantly  several times in each video, making them unrecognisable. Video also take a while to generate. After about five uses, it started asking me to pay for each video/photo, despite still only day one of the three day free trial. | I guess it’s ok but I’m not sure since they asked me for a review on my first minute of service - hence 3 stars 

Maybe more let’s see | It turned my wife and I into white people. Which, I suppose is telling of what is customarily acceptable. | Very unstable, switching between male/female on same character",4.4488,332,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a3/9d/49/a39d4922-4d9d-2857-77df-642276d134f0/9d071aa8-4924-4009-bbb5-8a02b4e54da0_1330.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/4a/e8/b3/4ae8b3ca-1aaa-9167-640a-fac663f894a7/9453126c-35cf-4ef0-8675-42483e4724d9_1329.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/34/8a/d5/348ad565-4503-5c36-23ad-7785087b5feb/107f431c-aa10-42ed-9334-feaabc3def84_1324.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/11/85/10/118510c0-c8ce-0b3c-453b-b2f0ff4601e5/28aec470-0cd0-4da7-a1d5-6f51d6c5164b_1325.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/fb/07/c9/fb07c978-c203-bcec-95ee-4f135f0903d9/d05b82a9-9411-456b-af26-09014daffe5f_1326.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f8/03/89/f8038964-b2c7-0ae0-e59b-5fd0f4e25793/4f2f51fc-e3fb-435b-87ba-4f522e91fa7c_1327.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Well worth adding it to your phone. | Very good info and very accurate! Thanks | I have used most of the weather apps and have found this app to reliable and provide more weather insights than the others. | I tried other weather apps after Dark Skies was eliminated for some crazy reason
Westher&Radsr us the bedt overall with long two week forecast good radar maps and exact location forecast | Easy to read | good | You have a good, no better then good, you have the best weather, website app on the web. You’ve made good better and better best, plus you never ever let it rest.  You’re always making good better and better best. | NO MORE FOR ME | Where’s the forecast for, tomorrow, next 4 days, next 10 days???  Also, I havebad allergies that leads to bad asthma.  You show fairly bad pollen tomorrow, but what kind?  Everyone else shows the types of pollen, you don’t know, or care!?  I do!!  I’m on a nebulizer now 4 times a day because I was outside last week in my yard and the oak tree pollen was so bad I had a asthma attack!!  Bye time to delete your app! | Awesome weather app | The best WeatherRadar I’ve ever seen and used very reliable even for long trips you can scroll out and look at the highway and you can look across many states to see if there’s going to be any rain or bad weather.

Finally a consistently good app -they’re quite rare are you now… | I’m very happy with this application and it’s always on 24-7 anytime I need it! | I LOVE HIS RAIN KEEP
IT COMING | As odd and unusual as this may seem to you folks, I happen to have 7 weather related apps.
   To some people perhaps that might appear to be 
“over the top,” but I like to keep informed.
    One particular thing about this particular app is the ability for it to show you 15 minute intervals of what the weather forecast will look like in “your particular area.”
                               Thanks for your help! | Great app! | This one is the best it doesn’t take a lot space in your phone memory. Always provide the most accurate information. | I really like this weather app a lot. I I have the free version and it’s great. They don’t restrict the information they give you like some of the other free versions weather apps. Of course they have ads but that’s understandable but the ads do not get in the way so I recommend this app. It’s very easy to read and to get information from different locations. | Great | It’s always accurate | Very well presented meteorological content | Knows to give us local weather hourly, and 10 day predictions. Also, same data for around 10 locations we easily select and change worldwide. | Thank you for such a accurate weather reporting! This year has been crazy in Michigan!🌦️🌨️❄️☀️☔️😵‍💫😁💝 | This has been my weather app for a long time. All the ads are just too much. It’s bad enough with all of them between your weather points. But now I have to wait for them before my cities with family come up. 
I am all for business but just too much. 

why did you remove the Barometric Pressure and other numbers from the app. Always just had to open the app and it was on the first page. That was very useful to me. | Fix it! | I am  just about 93 years old and need something not complecated to view now! Yours is exactly right! Thank you! | Change my temperature to readable temperature not Celsius | Awesome | Nice interface. But, this app tracks you and your other apps. Sorry, no can do. | The Dragon 🐉 What a Awesome 😎 and Amazing 🤩 Weather Forecast Team from the New 🆕 WWE Undisputed WWE Universe Champion The Ultimate Fighter Dragon 🐉 J-m-b Kiss 💋 Kiss 💋 Kiss 💋 Kiss 💋Kiss 💋Kiss 💋with Love 💗 Kiss 💋 Kiss 💋 Love 💕 Kiss 💋: | I love how this app shows the weather in real time and how it shows the temp  in 4 hr increments. Thank you | Excellent site | I’ve had a arsenal of weather apps, for years. This has been consistently, in the top 3.  Some are more flashy, and attract your attention.  But their accuracy fades.   Sometimes laughably.   This app has been reliable for years, and would trust it, in a jam, more than the other apps.   Sooo…..   5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | This is a Advertising Bill Board! 50-60% advertising on pages. Very useless service. Many truly free with some ads on them! Swing and a miss! | Me encanta esta aplicación es muy exacta 😍 | Before I had 5 weather apps.

Pro použití v datových schránkách si do mobilního telefonu nebo tabletu nainstalujte aplikaci Mobilní klíč a v Datových schránkách ji připojte ke svému uživatelskému účtu (Nastavení - Možnosti přihlášení - Přihlášení Mobilním klíčem). Pro přihlášení do Datových schránek pak stačí se přihlásit do Mobilního klíče otiskem prstu (nebo PINem, heslem či obrázkovým heslem - podle vlastní volby) a sejmout QR kód na přihlašovací stránce.

Jeden Mobilní klíč si můžete připojit k více datovým schránkám. Po přihlášení Mobilním klíčem vám pak Datové schránky nabídnou výběr ze všech dostupných uživatelských účtů.

Do Mobilního klíče mohou být také doručována upozornění na nové zprávy ve vaší datové schránce.

Pro přihlašování přes Národní bod se nabízí více možností. Poté co si aplikaci nainstalujete na mobilní telefon, můžete si buď do Národního bodu přenést svou identitu z datové schránky nebo si spárovat aplikaci Mobilní klíč se svým stávajícím účtem v Národním bodě za použití jiného elektronického prostředku pro přihlášení nebo si můžete na kontaktním místě veřejné správy (Czech POINT) založit nový účet v Národním bodě.

Mobilní klíč vyžaduje ke svému běhu iOS verze 11 či vyšší a zapnutý zámek obrazovky (nesmí být možné odemknout zařízení prostým odsunutím obrazovky, musí být nastaven odemykací obrazec, PIN nebo heslo).

Pokud má vaše zařízení Touch ID nebo Face ID a iOS alespoň 11, je možné se do Mobilního klíče přihlásit otiskem prstu (Touch ID) nebo načtením obličeje (Face ID).

Pro přihlášení do Datových schránek je potřeba, aby měl telefon či tablet přístup na internet - je jedno, zda přes mobilní data nebo pomocí Wi-Fi.

Aplikace Mobilní klíč zajišťuje pouze bezpečné přihlášení bez nutnosti zadávat přihlašovací údaje. Samotný přístup do datové schránky (čtení zpráv) probíhá i nadále ve webovém prohlížeči - aplikace nic jiného než přihlášení (a doručení notifikací) nezajišťuje.

Do supermarketů jsem nevkročila ani nepamatuji a to, že mi nikdo vozíkem nevjíždí na paty, nemusím stát ve frontě na pokladnu a vláčet minerálky do patra je prostě k nezaplacení. | Awesome app. Great service irl. | Not much to add:) | The app is super intuitive (and the food is good). It saves my favorite items and shows them quickly. Someone is clearly doing a good job optimizing the flow, resulting in a very seamless shopping experience. We don’t go to the store anymore. | Po nějaké době jsem opět zkusil použit k objednání aplikaci a poprvé se to podařilo. Tak tedy verze 5.3.3 se zdá být konečně funkční. Gratuluji. | v aplikaci jsem automaticky měla celý nákup tak jak jsem si ho naklikala v počítači a mohla jsem velice jednoduše přidávat další položky v telefonu, tak jak mě napadlo! Dokonale, děkuji, že mi pomáháte dělat můj život jednodušší! | I’ve been using Rohlik’s app for several years and gotta say, it’s less buggy than 90% other apps out there. 

My main suggestion would be to make it easy to put a “watchdog” function on an item that’s temporarily sold out, something that the desktop version does well. That way you don’t have to check every half-hour of they got a fresh supply of local strawberries… | Great app that is despite the mobile format almost as rich and practical as the desktop version! Cudos to bred roll (rohlik :-) | Easy, fast and practical shopping with delivery to you house, height quality and reliability for price premium | Good app. Prices meh | English please | Wish I could have the app in English | The app is useless. All I get when I launch is a screen asking for my address. Then some error in a non-English language. The developer should be fired. Really incompetent UX. | Why does it give me an error message everytime I try to use it? | There are away too many expats in Prague for this not to have an English option. I would love to use this but it’s too tedious to go back and forth translating from czech. | Generally speaking, expats in Czech are a segment that has a higher than average income and more open to change and new ideas (like ordering food online which has been present in more western countries for many years already). It seems like a big missed opportunity to not have the ability to switch the app to English. 

I’ve been learning Czech for about a year but I’m still not comfortable enough to navigate the app and read nutrient descriptions in it. So it is still more convenient for me to go to the store where, due to the physical nature, I have an easier time navigating. | This app appears to work as intended. You can fill a card and order. The delivery options are pretty clear. The reason it gets only four stars instead of five is because the text is not electronically readable nor zoomable. This makes it very difficult app for the visually impaired who are naturally be a large portion of the customers because this app offers a way to shop without driving. I hope the app developer will remedy the accessibility

I like my bitmoji look so much more than the animated one we have now.  Secondly, please stop pushing the Snapchat+ on every single screen in the app, once i select close and X thats that. Third thing, please stop forcing the AI features on to our chat log. I do not want to use it and I’d like to remove it from my list,  at least let it unpin it from the top and let it be. 
Please consider everything i’ve listed above. I believe that the changes would improve the app greatly. | It’s good | my Snapchat has been permanently banned from my phone. I did not do anything my account repeatedly got reported for no reason and now my phone is unable to open any account on Snapchat no matter what account it is I cannot open it because my whole entire phone is banned. I am very disappointed in Snapchat for allowing this. I am also very unhappy about this happening because I did nothing to deserve it after having multiple people on my Snapchat using it to communicate with people and talk to my friends and family I no longer can because of this | I love Snapchat so much | XXXtentacion 
rip | I put two starts cuz that’s the least selected one | i absolutely hate that this feature cannot be removed. it stays at the top of my chats and it’s super annoying. i will never use it. please make a way to remove it without paying money. i hate ai and there needs to be an option to not have it | This app and the stories they promote are absolute garbage! | It isn’t letting me send my snaps for some reason | Love it | Snapchat is a great way to interact with your friends and the shorts are so funny I love this app and I would recommend one of the best app in my phone. | they banned me for no reason i have 3 accounts of my iphone for snapchat and signed into a friends and said i was banned i have never been banned before and never broken tos or have been notified i have this is ridiculous | I have been attempting to contact Snapchat for an hour without success, navigating through menus in circles. I reinstalled the Snapchat app to explore it before investing in the stock, but I faced accessibility issues with VoiceOver, making it difficult to use. It is important to note that programs should be accessible by law. I tried signing up for the AI feature for improved access but got stuck on that page. Consequently, I deleted the app so I wouldn’t get pushed back to the app everytime I clicked on a link online. I was reminded quickly why I stopped trying to use Snapchat years ago. It was unaccessible then and still is. The last thing I wanted to do was put this in a review. However, I have not found an alternative way to contack support. | It’s not downloading and if had been loading for 4 days | I like Snapchat but sometimes it tweaks on me for no reason and I don’t like that so that is the particular reason why I am rating this app a 4 star review instead of a 5 star review | My girlfriend called my dog a pig swallower | One day I try to add someone and Snapchat pulls the FANUM tax and doesn't let me add them and still to this day still doesn't | My Snapchat has been banned for months now .. because I think someone tried to use my phone for suspicious activities on my account . I’ve tried to reach out to their customer service but no reply or answers . I’ve used Snapchat for the past 4 years and I’ve created good stuff there . I can’t afford to buy a new device and I can’t use my account aswell . | Hey guys have you ever feel the need to randomly send a picture to your friend snapchat is the way to go. Snapchat treats you right and has and ai yiu can ask questions with. Its so fun to call you friend and text your friend on this app. Thats all for now bye thanks for this lovely app | It’s ok Cauze it’s good texting and calling if ur freind or family dont have FaceTime or die but have Snapchat just use Snapchat | i love snapchat. its a fun way to chat with ur friends and use those funny filters. but snapchat WHAT R U DOING!!!! u dont have the brand heydudes or ariat. that need to change please, im tired of js my boring boots and can u upgrade the carhart hoodie please, its js not for me | Bring back ghost trails to snap+ | It’s great but I wish you would add more filters that aren’t based on the same thing | I LOVE SNAPCHAT!!!!! U SHOULD GET IT NOW😍😍😍😍😍😍😍✨✨✨✨😝✨😜❤️ | i’ve had snap for two years and this has happened to me multiple times. i go to open the app then it shows me “snapchat is a camera app” when i’ve had my microphone and camera available the whole time i’ve had it downloaded | If you have Snapchat plud don’t let it expire | Well I had Afro end but now I add hen and Snapchat don’t let me had hem 😭 | All apps are getting easier to use except Snapchat! Every update is worst that the other. | i’ve had this account for 3 years and i love the features in snapchat and i'm a member on snapchat+ and i love the the stuff on there the only thing i don't like is the AI i don't mind having it i just don’t  like having it pinned when i don't have snapchat | جميل | To be totally honest, I didn’t feel very enthused with SnapChat at all when it first became popular. 
I hated how easy it was to cheat with it, stalk with it, and binge watching meaningless bullsh*t that distracted me and blew my mind at the same time. 
Overall it was just too much. Filters and all. But now, I’m 30 and I have much bigger aspirations with my social media journey than I did 10 years ago when I was in college. Anyway, I appreciate the adaptive ness that Snapchat has had. It has been both an exciting ride to try and an encouraging way to keep things fresh as an adult transitioning in my career. Discretion is still advised, IMO but as an app, it’s pretty entertaining. | so, imagine you have this terrible username that you made in 2021, but you made your account as a joke, so you didnt think much of the password, nothing you would remember ect. ect. fastforward 3 years later you regret your user and wish to change it, BUT you dont have an email or a phone number set up. so when you go to set that up, you CANT because it asks to verify you WITH YOUR PASSWORD but you dont know your password, so your STUCK. terrible, 1 star. | Snapchat Has made me very hard 🥰 I love Snapchat and it is very intelligent 🥰 thanks for letting me and my cutie bf meet 🥰 | Trash update. Bring back side to side stories, why you trying to be like everyone else | I love Snapchat.it’s a great way of communicating with my friends out of school and in school.❤️ | feces | Stop forcing notifications to get people to open the app. Phantom notifications for people adding to their story is more annoying than useful. | Snap is good it just has to get rid of the ai it’s no help. | Snapchat is really private and public at the same time. You can half swipe and sometimes keep it a secret. If you don’t half swipe but open the message you are being public by telling the person that you opened their text. 
PERSONALLY, I adore snap.!! | With all the things snapchats updates on its app, maybe Snapchat should consider adding the option to assist with accessing your account in case you don’t have access to the verification code. I have a lot of photos in snap that I can’t access since I don’t have access to that old number anymore. Super annoying. | I was chatting with one of my friends and the AI somehow got the Snapchat and then told me how cute I looked in my black shirt then later denied that they had even said that, and every time I said that I wanted to speak to someone about it you were like oh I can’t do that. What’s your concern we can talk. yeah there’s no way to report the AI for doing this stuff. | About to just delete because I cannot rember the dumb my ai. I don’t not want it remove it now!!!! | I cannot add a video to snap or even add a caption and my app is up to date. | This ai gives out false answers it used to be kindve good but now it’s trash idk what happened but don’t depend on it for answers on your test you will get a 50 or below | Why does Snapchat say unknown when my friends call me off Snapchat? | I updated my Snapchat today and im unable to send friend request or accept request | If I could give this app no stars , I so would Snapchat I don’t know what your doing but you need to stop | I got a 2 year account that i had banned

I will never use airbnb again. I heard people say they dont like airbnbs because they are never clean . Now I see what everyone means. My last 3 airbnbs have been disgusting and each time it gets worse. The worse part about airbnb  is they take the HOST side before the consumer and we pay all the money. They don’t compensate you for the dirty and unsafe listing. Airbnb support told me my host was being to kind for refunding me for the days after I cancel my airbnb ! As she should because I wont be there !!!! The blatant disrespect has lost a loyal customer. Airbnb should be ASHAMED ! | I rented an apartment and I got a notice of the host not paying rent. When I contacted air bnb they said they couldn’t do anything! I paid way more than the actual rent, since I had the bill, and was shocked to know Air Bnb couldn’t do a thing! I had to handle it with my host, is what they said. Why do I pay a service fee then? How can you allow someone to post a rental if it’s not paid for on the host side? The customer service has gone downhill dramatically in the last year. So many issues with so many properties and they never help. After 6 years I am done with this app. Hotels at least are more accountable than this platforms and it’s rentals. | So Awesome | Still trying to get help with my Airbnb account?
No one is listening! The account will not open or not update??? I have a black screen only! Going on vacation soon and haven’t been able to book or fix bookings! Help!!! This is so unprofessional that no one cares to respond? Did you die? No support or help so I will post everyday until I get someone’s attention??? Help!! | This company is a scam, it has absolutely no customer service. I have several issues with the app itself and for a stay I did using the app. I am chatting on the app and random people come and say they will work on the case but fee mins later they are gone and no updates for several days. Chat bot keeps asking do you still need help but that dumb bot doesn't see that airbnb has done nothing. I have called and talked to actual people but they say they will work but nothing is done by them as well. I previously reported issue to executive team and that person said let me work on it and get back to you but it has been more than a month and no one has responded. Disgusting app experience and with the staff of airbnb | I have used airbnb for years. They decided to remove my account with no further explanation, asked for an appeal and the information they based this decision on. Just denied my appeal and removed my account unfairly. This app was great, has been horrible this past year. | Don’t download this. For some reason it needed a card put in then it took $22 from my account. Very annoying | after years of dealing with discrimination, terrible customer service, rates above market price, and a platform that puts its hosts above its guests, I just had my last negative experience. Verbo and hotels.com are better in every way. | They don’t care anymore. 
Customer service will leave you hanging with no way to escalate issue to upper management. 

What are we suppose to do now | I had decent experience with airbnb. My issue comes in with the “review” system. I don’t feel it is fair that the app urges us to give the host a good review or it won’t be posted, but the host can write a bad review about the customer and it gets posted with no issues. Plus we have to “dispute” a negative review through support which takes forever if it even happens. It’s very dishonest and unfair to current and future users. All reviews about the host should be posted, good or bad because all reviews get posted about the customer no matter if it’s good or bad. I will not use the app anymore because of this. I deleted my account. | Verification system threw up random error messages on browser when trying to verify phone number.
Then after I try on the app it says I can’t confirm for 24 hours?!
Talked to customer service representative but they were VERY unhelpful. | I have used Airbnb for 6 years. On 4 different occasions I have booked an Airbnb 5+ months out from my scheduled trip and then had the hosts cancel on me right before. This year, Airbnb allowed the host to cancel on me 2 days before my trip leaving me to panic and scramble to find a new one. I tried numeorus times reaching out for assistance and got nothing in return. I can no longer rely on Airbnb, there is no point in booking one since hosts can cancel whenever. The hosts have too much power and Airbnb does nothing to protect or assist renters. | Just felt bitter about recent encounter with Airbnb. I had an excursion planned in Europe and my flight was cancelled in Amsterdam’s — thanks KLM. I didn’t make a flight and Airbnb would not try to workout a deal and charged $250+ even though it wasn’t our fault.
Peace, 
Max | Idk what I would do without airbnb honestly ! Wether it's for traveling , work, vacation, or lifestyle good or bad! It's definitely worth booking through, no resort fees or security deposits ! | 2 of the last 3 times I used AirBnB, the listings seriously misrepresented the property. One claimed to have 3 bathrooms; in actuality the property had only 1 toilet. The other claimed to be oceanfront / beachfront; in actuality it was ~1 or 2 blocks from the beach. (The 3rd one was honest and wonderful). 
I don’t know if I’ll use AirBnB again. It’s a risk. Owners seem fine with making stuff up and AirBnB seems not to have any mechanism to ensure accurate listings, they try to get you to “work it” with the owner. | When things go wrong your on your own.  They will not protect you and you will not get your money back, we call this a scam in business.  
What a joke.  They used to be good but now have no moral compass.  Sad. | I had a host accept my alternate stay and she never refunded my money back. I called Airbnb Support and she didn’t respond to them. I lost out on $687.09 . The Customer Service is in India so you will not get any help with that either. If the host withheld your refund, the host can negotiate what they want to give back. This is company is not about the customer it’s about the host. | I don’t know how people afford to book Airbnbs anymore. The fees are just out of control. Between the cleaning and booking fees, it’s literally half the price if you stay at a hotel.  Airbnb please reign this in and go back to basics. As far as the app, filtering options are limited…and quite inaccurate. If I search for waterfront, I’m not interested in your property that’s a 1 mi drive to the water. 🙄 | At lease at a hotel you can hold someone accountable and/or get a refund if the host doesn’t hold up their end of the deal. AirBnB does not have any interest in your complaints or concerns. The rental could be completely wrong, full of bugs, mold, and you will be stuck for the duration. Don’t take my word for it, just research AIRBNB nightmares and you’ll find that this organization is completely corrupt and the hosts are more often than not dishonest in their listings and Airbnb does not verify that listings are as advertised. A scheme all the way to the top. I lost months of funds while traveling due to booking extended stays at a string of listings that fell very short of expectation, including the bugs and mold. It was too late once I realized that no matter what listing I ended up at, none of them were as advertised and the company told me too bad. Video evidence, pictures. Didn’t matter. They just assumed it was in bad faith. They tell you to settle it on site with the host. They’ll tell you the host has THE ENTIRE DURATION of your stay to resolve the issue. Even if they make no effort to resolve the complaint, it still counts. RUN FOR YOUR LIFE. | Why do you hide addresses? I’m trying to book a place and I want to look up on a map how close it is to trails. Your built in map doesn’t show the trails so I need the address to look on a trail map. In the end I didn’t book through this app. Hiding the address is shady! Hotels don’t hide their address. I booked a hotel instead! Completely stupid business model! | The idea that Airbnb allows their host to charge crazy high cleaning fees is ridiculous. You should not be allowed to charge a daily cleaning unless you are cleaning daily!!!

Airbnb needs to get rid of the cleaning fees and let the hosts build that price into their rental rates - just like a hotel. | Why is it that I can’t use the app I have. If I can’t download new one it seems wrong to force me to upgrade to a new phone. | Air bnb used to be a good option, but now since all air bnb’s charge $200 plus cleaning fees on top of all the other fees, and built in rules…. Requiring you to clean…. It lost its luster. At least at hotels you don’t have to clean and you also get free breakfast. | Airbnb used to be so much better - now the customer service is non existent, with any problems you will be speaking to a robot, and my last 3 cases I spent useless hours and nothing was ever resolved! Pull it together Airbnb! No more robots for customer service - give us Real and logical humans! | Limited trust and safety. Multiple scams ongoing related to insufficient host/ fraud checks. Constantly see reviews purporting scams and false placements. | Their host are always so awful. they all just wanna steal your money. horrible app do not recommend. They will try to charge you on top of the total price. overall a horrible app. | Worst experience staying somewhere of my life. $20/night apt and the hosts never settled on how to pay for it. Then pressed charges when stuff was missing from her apartment after I left it in perfect condition minus a used towel. | After arriving at Arthur's condo in Phoenix we requested to cancel because it was the most unsafe area we had ever tried to stay while using Airbnb. I consistently use this service while traveling for work. After the poor and lack of communication from air bnb I will most likely not use this service anymore. 
To give an example the parking lot of the condo and surrounding area was littered with drug addicts dealers and what seemed to be a tent city across the street. I highly recommend not staying here. I'm from the South Side of Chicago and didn't want to get out of the car if you know what I mean. 
There has been no support from air bnb and we will be contacting our credit card company for a refund. | I came to the Airbnb service so that I would not have to worry about finding a place to live. I found 2 ads and both turned out to be fraudulent. How do you keep the service clean? I don't want to look anywhere for housing, I'm ready to pay extra for airbnb service. They are trying to deceive me, at first they tried to take me to their third-party site, then they say that the ad I chose is unavailable, the room is occupied, they offered another one for $ 300 more expensive. Well, I agreed, now they ask to be contacted by phone before confirming the reservation. I am dissatisfied with the Airbnb service, I will never use it again and I will not recommend it to anyone. | I’ve had continual issues with Airbnb over the last year, I can never reserve anything with a vague “something went wrong” error. Tried on multiple browsers and multiple devices until I inevitably get a “too many attempts message”. | Too much expensive . Booking hotel seems to be better than Airbnb | I went to Spokane from Ohio for my sons, chemotherapy treatments me and my wife and my son, when we first got there, we booked under my wife’s account and ended up having to leave the first Airbnb. We were at because of family emergencies and they needed their home and so we booked a different day well the night after we got there I got a notification from our Host stating that Airbnb canceled our reservation and we needed to leave immediately. I didn’t understand why so my wife went into her account to check to see what happened and they completely removed her account and said that we were partying even though they had no proof or evidence because we weren’t. Well, we asked for a refund for the rest of the nights because we spent $900 and they kept saying they would escalate our case escalate. Our case never contacted us back never put the account back up and never gave us a refund for our money. Well, we went and booked an Airbnb under my name on my account and ended up getting robbed. All of our belongings got stolen and Airbnb helped us with rebooking we rebooked the Airbnb. We had the hot tub didn’t work so we wanted to go somewhere else. They issued us a coupon and the second they issued all those coupons to my account, they sent me an email stating they were removing my account from the platform for party risk of partying, again with no evidence and no warning at all and now they are refusing to talk to us at all and I just lost over $900 again which is totaling out to about $1900 that we’ve lost within the last week and now they refuse to give us our accounts back or even a gift voucher with the amount on it so we could get somewhere else to stay. Do not book with Airbnb. They will scam you. | Mario is been the best host you can ever find, this is the second time using his house and his responses are fast and efficient, thank you Mario | I have been utilizing Air bnb since its inception and I will tell you that it is the hosts that define the quality of this product and not the app.  That being said, the Airbnb app is now the most convenient tool  to find alternatives to hotels in the travel biz.  I do find google search to run a close second to this app and find google infinitely easier to use- such that I find many Airbnb on google then get the details on Airbnb app.  

I still find Airbnb format, codes and operation extraordinarily ineffective in getting the whole picture.  Even many reviews reveal hidden codes as “cozy bed” meaning its rented for 2 people but its not even a queen bed -or- “rustic” surroundings meaning a junkyard is on the same block as where you are staying. 

Also, app navigation has never been that intuitive. I still find myself vetting stuck in places and starti g the app over. It is as if they never really knew what a “back button” was. 

In the end, I have had many good experiences and one or two exceptional ones, all being because the host made it so. 

March 2020 entry

The app has definitely gotten better with a few issues remaining. Receipts can be viewed but not printed, emailed, or otherwise utilized in any way!?? House rules seem to be more dodgy than ever. Sometimes they are easily found, sometimes theyare emailed after a reservation and almost all are rants of disorganized personalities 🤪 . Airbnb survives because of really cool people hosting the coolest and most diverse amenities ever offered. Airbnb serves this market with an average score of 3 stars. App now cuts off text messages and inhibits return messages even inside the app. Het twice the messages tou cannot respond to. Cool! Just keeps getting worse! This app is different but not better Has the search by map been removed or moved where I can't find it?? Why is taking longer to find more unavailable properties? Just updated again to try features and tools. App freezes... App is still clunky but better than it was but I just got recommended stays a surprising distance from my intended destination..... The app is worse than ever and the whole AIRBNB system is getting to be a frustrating mess. I have attempted to book 5 locations in the last 6 months with one success. After a major frustration I was offered over $100 instant credits and still chose not to book with AIR BNB...... This is getting unfriendlier and more ""corporate"" by the day. Earlier version .... Whoever released this needs to roll it back up! I have attempted to book stays with complete frustration and mix ups. The app has reversed it performance of user ease. Avoid this new version.... | It said to update so I did and now it’s just a black screen | $300 a night? lol, don’t forget $160 Airbnb fees, $150 taxes, and of course the $250 cleaning fee. Airbnb rates are a joke and so many renters know it and offer their properties on other sites or on personal pages for much less. I doubt you’ll ever find your best deal here. | Airbnb refused to give my handicap mother a refund, even though the property we tried to rent from Stuart Morley was not handicap accessible! There wasn't even room for my mom's wheelchair anywhere and we only stayed a few days out of the 25 that we reserved. Airbnb has this individual to steal from us with no ability to recover the money and the trip interruption insurance they offer is worthless too, and didn't cover anything! Don't ever use this service or you'll lose your money and never be able to get it back. They purposely allow people that they are being prejudiced towards handicap people to continue to be on there and make money from their service. Airbnb is a bunch of thieves. | Since New update, the app will not open on my phone. Just rotates the app symbol. | Most of my personal travel is with my four-legged friend. It is so much easier and less expensive to use AirBNB instead of hotel chains.  Occasionally I use it for business travel when I am looking for a specific area and can’t find a hotel. | I had always heard from friends how Airbnb scams its customers and it happened to me too. I was held responsible for existing damages in a cabinet and was charged $150 for the chipped corner paint. I have many other friends telling me how the hosts show repair documentation and they go and proceed to over charge for existing damages in a property and they try to hold you responsible for it. | THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY, AS LONG AS THEY MAKE MONEY OFF OF YOU. NARROWLY ESCAPED A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I recently experienced a concerning situation during a reservation with Airbnb, prompting me to share a cautionary tale with fellow users. Regrettably, my experience has led me to conclude that Airbnb’s commitment to customer safety may not align with their public image. Despite raising genuine safety concerns during my stay and providing detailed information, the response from Airbnb’s support team exhibited a lack of thorough consideration and logical coherence. The decision-making process appeared flawed, with the introduction of logical fallacies and an apparent disregard for the gravity of the issues raised. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with Airbnb’s customer service, as it seems the platform prioritizes financial transactions over the safety and well-being of its users. Consequently, I have chosen to discontinue using Airbnb for future accommodations. I urge potential users to exercise caution when considering Airbnb for their lodging needs. While the platform may offer a wide array of options, my unfortunate commitment to addressing safety concerns promptly and responsibly. It is essential for users to be aware that Airbnb’s customer support may fall short of expectations when faced with issues that require careful consideration and thorough investigation. The logical fallacies evident in their response, including appeals to ignorance, non sequiturs, and hasty generalizations, highlight a concerning lack of rigor in their decision-making process. Such lapses in reasoning raise questions about the reliability of Airbnb’s customer support and their ability to handle situations that involve safety and security. In light of these experiences, I strongly caution potential users against relying solely on Airbnb for their lodging needs. Exploring alternative accommodation options with a reputation for prioritizing customer safety and providing robust support mechanisms might be a more prudent choice. While Airbnb has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we travel and seek accommodations, my recent encounter has revealed a disconcerting aspect of their customer service that cannot be overlooked. As consumers, our safety and well-being should remain paramount, and I believe it is crucial to consider these factors when choosing a platform for lodging arrangements. In conclusion, my recommendation is to approach Airbnb with caution and to carefully evaluate their commitment to safety and customer support. It is my hope that this review serves as a reminder for users to prioritize platforms that consistently uphold the highest standards of service and safety. | App is very easy to use | It is nice to book and enjoy experiences but let’s hope nothing detrimental occurs because they have no resolution or policies for refunds | I used to love using Airbnb, now there is a ridiculous amount of fees added at the end and the total ends up being 3 or 4 times the advertised price. This kind of false advertising is very disappointing as Airbnb used to be much more transparent. There is a button you can select that gives you a closer number to what you will ultimately pay.  But I don’t like being tricked into a false sense of security by these fake prices. | To be clear, LOVE the service. This review is of the app's usability as a visually impaired person.

Text (as in 'how to get in' messages) cannot be zoomed in on. Nor can it be copied by a long press. This forces you into all sorts of cludgy work-arounds.

As noted, love the service but make the app more user friendly. | I’m a host with three years’ experience on Airbnb. In general, it was OK, but when I got a scammer guest who reserved in the wrong place and then lied and said my place was dirty, in order to cancel the reservation and get her money back, the support from Airbnb customer service was terrible. Though I was a “SuperHost” with all five-star ratings, they believed the guest and gave her all her money back.
I recently tried returning to Airbnb but found the customer service is still inadequate. They give you the runaround endlessly, seemingly trying to wear you out, rather than help you. I am done with hosting on Airbnb. I recommend using FurnishedFinder.Com. They don’t take a percentage of your rent, but rather a yearly fee of about $150. | If you get a bad air bnb rental don’t expect any help from air bnb. Scammers! | AirBnB is one of those services that when it works well and everyone involved is being honest is wonder but the moment you have a disreputable host you can lose a massive amount of money. I had a host mislead me on a listing and when I found out less than 48 hours later and attempted to cancel I was met with a 900 dollar cancelation fee, when I tried to contact AirBnB I was met with a we will reach out to the host and the host refused to give me my money back. Airbnb told me that it was up to the host who had mislead me in the listing to begin with. The real shame is that there are good and honest hosts but the fact that predatory ones are allowed to continue doing business makes it impossible for me to even consider continuing business with them. | The house owner used old item blame us for damage and charge me for damage which we never use and that item not even in my room. The review are fake. You can see one person put multiple 5 stars review make it looks like perfect place.

CO VŠECHNO NAŠE MAPA UMÍ

• Více než 900 tipů na neokoukaná místa v Česku, která jsme pro vás osobně prozkoumali a vybrali
∙ Jednoduché vyhledávání podle kategorií (např. rozhledny, zříceniny, větrné mlýny, lomy apod.) a regionů
∙ Místa si můžete prohlížet na interaktivní mapě od Mapy.cz
∙ Nebo si je můžete procházet podle fotek
∙ Vaše oblíbená místa si můžete uložit do oblíbených
• Přidávejte si do navštívených místa, na kterých jste už byli
∙ Tipy na výlety s dětmi, kočárkem nebo psem
∙ Výlety pro vozíčkáře
∙ Informace o místech a vstupném
∙ Fotky od profesionálních českých fotografů
∙ Neustále vyrážíme na nová úžasná místa a přidáváme je do naší mapy a na náš Instagram

PROČ JSME MAPU VYTVOŘILI?

Za mapou úžasných míst stojím já (Krista) a moje mamka Eva. Společně vlastníme cestovatelskou komunitu Úžasná místa v Česku @uzasna.mista na Facebooku a Instagramu, kam přispíváme fotkami z našich výletů a z míst, která nám posílají naši fanoušci. 
Procestovaly jsme skoro 40 zemí světa, ale přesto jsme přesvědčené o tom, že u nás v Česku máme na malém území tolik úžasných míst, že můžeme leckteré turistické destinace hravě strčit do kapsy. 

Vybraly jsme pro vás s mámou více než 600 překrásných míst v Česku, která podle nás stojí za návštěvu. Velkou část z nich pravděpodobně nebudete znát, což byl náš záměr. Nechceme totiž posílat tisíce lidí jen na profláklá turistická místa, kde se to už teď hemží turisty. Našim cílem je dávat vám inspiraci na stovky neokoukaných míst a rozprostřít tak turismus po celé naší nádherné zemi. 

Doufáme, že si naší mapu a tipy na výlety užijete. 
Děkujeme moc za stažení!

The PID Lítačka mobile app is a comprehensive guide to transport in Prague and the Central Bohemian Region. It enables you to find current public transport connections based on your location and also recommends the type of ticket you need for your journey. The app works with up-to-date data about closures, disruptions, and so on. If you wish to use the app for buying tickets regularly, you can create an account and have your tickets safely under control. You can store your payment card in the app and pay with a single click, or use Google/Apple Pay. The app allows you to purchase tickets in advance and activate them gradually before boarding a vehicle. Furthermore, you can purchase a subscription ticket (coupon) from 1 month up to 1 year directly in the app.

A new feature in PID Lítačka is the ability to pay for parking in paid parking zones throughout Prague. This new functionality allows you to store the license plates of your personal and company vehicles and pay for parking as easily and quickly as for a ticket.

The app can be used even without registration.

What else does the app offer?

-Check-in via the mobile app, or the possibility to use the mobile app as an identifier for long-term time tickets
-Find the fastest connection including closures and restrictions, and optimal tickets for your journeys
-Display a map of connections including navigation to the stop
-Display the status of your long-term coupon and your identifiers
-Buy tickets in advance with the option of later activation if necessary

-Ability to pay for parking in paid parking zones throughout Prague

I could buy tickets on the fly or plan our route the night before. With tickets in hand, I always knew what stop or platform to go to. | Agree with others: easy to use, mapping a route provides cost and link to pay, Apple Pay enabled. One of the best transportation apps I’ve used. | Twice now I have tried to create an account. I signed up with one email and a message said I’d be getting a verification email. I have been checking for over 24 hours and there is no email. So I then tried a different email and still no verification email ever came. Update: the emails all went to my spam. That hasn’t happened in forever, therefore I attribute it to whatever is in the origin of the email sender. | Should be an instance for everyone else! | I was only in Prague for a few days but this app worked very well, the design and user interface was excellent, it was easy to use and figure out, each ticker gives you a bar code but we never got stopped so not sure if that works for the police. One thing to note is when you buy tickets on the app you need to wait 2 minutes after you activate before it becomes valid so buy tickets before you get on | Not a bad app, but the two minutes to activate is a major issue. The inspectors come and will fine you with as little as 10 seconds left before it activates, and since they can check whomever they want, they often target women, especially those riding alone. I just ended up buying the year pass, but for people who ride only once or twice, the two minutes is a huge pain. Either you get on before your ticket activates and hope, or you activate it before the bus/tram/metro even arrives—cutting into the amount of time you’ve paid to be allowed to travel. And if the bus is late, and so your ticket expires before you reach your destination? That’s a fine, too. Major design flaw! | Does exactly what it’s supposed to. Always very easy to use! | Everything I needed for public transport in Prague. It was super easy to register and pay via Apple Pay. | I enabled alert for “Exceptions” and found it was too many notifications. I disabled it within the app but still receive alerts. 

Otherwise, for purchasing lowest-price tickets I find it is the most useful app, even for long trips outside of Prague. | Every time I search for a connection and press ""Search"", it instead searches for the most recent connection from my search history. This bug has been there for months, there's no way to report it from the app, so obviously the developer doesn't care at all about their user experience. I'm switching to pubtran. | I was just about to buy two tickets on my phone and found out that only one has been purchased. I wanted to purchase another one for my wife and got an error, even though money was deducted from my account!
What do I do when an inspection comes?! | Terrible that the app doesn’t notify when you pass expires. This cost me CZK824 in fines. 

The app is very poor indeed and they refuse to reimbursement for their design flaw. 

No Apple Wallet integration. 

App redirects you to the crappy website so you have to login to a website within an app. | You can’t buy tickets with iOS 13 as your OS. The tickets do not show up so I was forced to buy a paper ticket. | Is this app not compatible with iOS 13? I am not able to buy any tickets, the screen to buy just says “ticket selection could not be loaded”. My wife’s phone had no problem on iOS 12. | Great app. Clear navigation options, accurate timetables and with Apple Pay integration, makes it super easy to purchase tickets. Other translation apps take notice! | Must have, works perfectly fine. It has all the live updates that you need. | It is decent enough when it functions properly, but in 90% of the time you'll see a message saying ""At this moment there is no connection for the data entered.""

And you'll need to click the 'search' button again and again and again in order to see the results. | Aplikace jako taková je celkem povedená, ale velmi často v ní dochází k této chybě: ""Pro zadané hodnoty v tuto chvíli neexistuje žádné spojení."" K této chybě dochází nezávisle na zadaných hodnotách a dochází k ní i na dobrém připojení, např. na 4G nebo WiFi. Pokud hledání např. pětkrát zopakuji, tak se většinou nakonec najde. K této chybě nedochází vždy, ale zhruba při polovině pokusů. Asi jde o přetížené servery nebo něco podobného.

Další chyba není tak závažná, ale je taky otravná: Když třeba omylem kliknu na zadání času odjezdu, tak se vybere nějaký konkrétní čas a už to nijak nejde vrátit na ""teď"". Jediná možnost je aplikaci shodit a znovu zapnout. | Skvělá aplikace bez reklam, jízdní rady včetně schémat PID a jednoduchého nákupu. Ma anglickou i německou verzi. Super. | Aplikace je v současnosti dobrá jen na kupování jízdenek. Vyhledat spojení a další funkce nefungují. Uvítala bych možnost i zjistit zastávkové jízdní řády. A neškodila by možnost zakoupení 1/2 denní nebo jednodenní sms jízdenky. | Coming first-hand from the Prague Public Transport Co., this is, hands down, the best public transport app for Prague.

Not the same. Easier to use chrome where I can translate. Deleted. | When it comes to the app itself, it’s really a great tool. Very easy to maneuver and browse. There is a lot of extra information about the items which increases my confidence in ordering the correct size. 

The service itself is great too. Low shipping cost and easy returns. 

The minus point is not for the app itself but the fact that certain items cannot be delivered to my country which is not indicated until checkout. This is very frustrating. Why are are there restrictions. These are entirely incomprehensible. We are within the EU and should have access to the entire catalogue. | Add on Georgian App Store | App ist gut. aber Gutschein ist mega kompliziert . ich wurde niemals kaufen! | Zolang het Nike-schoenen zijn, is het niet op voorraad | I’ve had several instances where my refund wasn’t completed due to “me not returning “ something. Not true, including some inexpensive things, like dvf dresses. 😢😢 easy return process, but not always honest | Use at your own risk.

I returned a pair of shoes. They contact me saying they received a pair of shoes that I never ordered. It's a new pair, women's shoes, for which they give me their article code too. I say I never sent those shoes, please check that you received my pair of shoes. They say nope, we received from you a pair of shoes that you never ordered (btw more expensive than mine), so we can't refund you, happy to have you as a customer, have a nice day.

So after spending 250eur with them on multiple orders, they basically claim that I returned a more expensive, brand new pair of shoes that I never ordered. Never for a second they suspect that in a warehouse that handles thousands of articles daily there could have been a mix up. | Depuis la mise à jour l’application beug beaucoup | I previously used the app to sell gently used items to Zalando through their Sell Bix program.

It constantly keeps logging me and my friends out of the account, even though we haven’t reached the device count. We keep having to reset the password just to access our account every what, every week? Everything is paid for. There aren’t that many logged in devices, so I don’t know what’s going on. What’s also funny, is that hulu started doing the same thing. And we SURELY didn’t reach the device count on that one. Fix your stupid app, because at this point it’s wasting my money. | I am so glad you made this video 
Love s | Very asthetic | I love these movies | I love the Marvel series | The Disney+ subscription does not disappoint! All of my favorites are in one app! I love that I can start watching at home on my tv and finish on my phone or tablet when I’m away! Highly recommend! | The app always crashes and resets back to the Home Screen on the tv app. | Very good programming | I like Disney+ but sometimes when I am a not at home or sitting in my car my wi-Fi doesn’t work for Disney+ for some reason but other then that I like watching Disney+ so yeah 

Bye have a good day | This is such a great app to watch! Disney+ is so amazing because my family and I always watch something all together. I love how it gives you so many movies and tv shows to watch! My little sister LOVES this app as well!As soon as I come home from work I go and watch something on Disney+. So my point is that I LOVE Disney+!!! | I love Disney+ because you can watch you favorite actor like liv and mAddie | It glitches all the time. I’m wondering if it’s because we have an ad supported account. | Disney has all you can think of and there’s kid mode for inappropriate things you don’t want your kid watching | I love this new goosebumps 🩵 | Disney supports in some form institutions that suppress the human rights of some of the most disenfranchised humans on the planet. They should be boycotted as consequence | I dont like Taylor Swift cuz shes bad | The content is great, but it crashes a lot. There are also some ghost buttons while watching. However, this is a great app, and waaaaaaay better than Disneynow. EDIT I’m sorry, I had to change my review. It was 4 stars, but the Eras Tour made it 5. You have done a great thing for us Swifties! Thank you! YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! Real rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Edit 2:

If you don’t want the ads, just pay. Calm down. Welcome to capitalist America. | It is cool with the greenish blue and the Taylor swift concert is awesome I didn’t know that you like Taylor swift | It’s oh k but it could be better | Awesome | MAKE MORE X-MEN ‘ 97 EPISODES | Its ok app but doesn’t have enough content. Waste of your money!!! | I was just to lazy to write a cringey story so I just gonna recommend this, also ඞ | I would feel bad about writing this but I’m not and because have grown sick of the ads every two seconds it’s ads all over the place and when I rewind on episodes I have to rewatch the ad all over again and even when I watch stuff on my phone I can still do other things and still watch the ads but the second I try to go back into Disney plus it restarts me and I have to watch the ads all over again i would sadly you need to do better but I know this is probably going to get deleted anyway | Disney is the greatest!! | Bad content… most of the time. Ruined Star Wars, ruined marvel and ruined Mickey Mouse. | anyway so ,WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE LOGO THE BRIGHT TEAL COLOR DOSE NOT SUIT IT ,LIKE BELIEVE ME ,ITS NOT ROCKING IT 
, IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR ORDERED 5 DOLLARS TO REDECORATE IT, PLS TRY HARDER, I REALLY LIKE HOW THE OCEAN ONE LIKE NUMBER ONE RANKING THE OG ONE IS THE BEST, PERIOD, AND ONE LAST THING IF YOUR GONNA CHANGE IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE DONT EVER USE BRIGHT COLORS. AND THAT IS A PERIOD AGAIN. | No option to remove shows from Continue Watching? Automatic 1-star. It’s 2024. Get with it. Random shows get added to my Continue Watching, shows I’d never watch and I can’t even remove them. | This is absolutely the most amazing streaming experience you CAN HAVE!!!!!
🤩🤩🤩 there is  even prenatal guidance for parents who don’t want their kids to be watching things that they don’t know. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!! 😝😝😝 | Nice sows and good stories cute stories | It’s slow and lagging again. I wasted my money on a subscription again thinking it was fixed. | I deleted YouTube And this is a great replacement for it | That I have to pay for an app that has ads everywhere. Just dumb. Cancels after free trial bc there really isn’t enough here to make it worthy | Love this app for the next update can you please add the show Cory in the house I would really appreciate it thank you | Save us all vote your shares with Nelson Peltz. | Disney is very good with no ads and I like that | Disney+ does have some good things but has many many many problems to work out and annoying one for me is there ability not to be able to remove something from the content you watch in or to remove a show from Disney+ entirely | I love it but I was about to watch elemental but a add came and.I thought Disney + didn’t have adds. 🤔 | when i first watch something on disney plus, the shows (lego droid tales) it’s my childhood!! loved this app, 10/10!! :)) | “Shop” tab now on the shows? Pathetic money grab | This streaming service is so cool I even get to watch my favorite show, Once upon a time. I highly recommend!!!! | A lot of it is not for kids, so get rid of it😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 you ruined proud family😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 let recess be able to buy on AppleTV. It’s not fair mad face.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 | Its great except you have to be careful when they advertise Hulu. They will put Hulu titles on there and you have to look closely in case they say “included with your Hulu subscription” or you might have a rise in your Disney+ bill.. | march 21: watchlist still broken

march 6th: watchlist still broken watchlist suddenly stopped loading, only the first few shows/movies load | After a whole month of Apple Vision Pro being released, Disney+ still hasn’t fixed their 3D movie not playing issue | 𝕋𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕒𝕡𝕡 𝕚𝕤 𝕤𝕠 𝕤𝕥𝕦𝕡𝕚𝕕 𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕔𝕙𝕚𝕝𝕕𝕚𝕤𝕙 𝕝𝕚𝕜𝕖 𝕞𝕒𝕜𝕖 𝕚𝕥 𝕓𝕖𝕥𝕥𝕖𝕣 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕚𝕤 𝕤𝕠𝕠𝕠 𝕤𝕥𝕦𝕡𝕚𝕕 | We as family love the tv shows and new and iconic movies that we watch on family movie night.  The shows are educational and some are very inspiring.  Disney should continue on for many many years! | Fix your app. Anytime I pause and resume something it resumes playing not where I paused the episode or show. We pay too much money after the subscription price has doubled in the past few years to be having issues with basic functionality of the app. This has been an issue for months and still no fix for it. | The amount of ads is insane.  A one star rating is too high. | Got 3 min into a show to get 1:45 min ad. Guess I’ll go back to how I used to and wait for shows to complete the season and then get it for a month then cancel.

And if I want to update my video it has to be the exact same length as the one I’m replacing or the app won’t even “see” it in my photos and videos.  And you can’t make the voiceovers have any emotion or excitement or sarcasm to them | The app works amazingly however you have to have the monthly subscription to export videos. | Una aplicación muy amigable, es super sencillo y útil su uso. | very incredible he liked it a lot 5 stars plus my 10 stars very good the creator of the app for iOS I thank you for helping a lot with the app I am grateful for you there are many interested in helping users gratitude for my presence | You have to pay pro just to make it not worth it | Doesn’t create a voice clone. It will only dub videos that you speak in. If there is any background noise then the dub will come out distorted | It’s very good but really needs b roll video option not just still media. | I love captions, but it is insanely clunky and hard to be precise with exact font structure and placement. 
Rather than relying on Breaks and Timing to structure the font, there should be options to place font down with intentional framing and placement. 
It seems like a super basic feature that wouldn’t be hard to add and would just add a bit of versatility to captioning your videos. 

As is, it’s hard to use outside of “set it and forget it”. | The captions are not working. Is it being fixed?! | There are bugs when editing and sometimes the export isn’t true to the playback within the app. | Too complicated | Love it with there service absolutly amazing ❤️ | DO NOT GET THIS APP. Making a 1 minute video with abt 100 words and randomly every other word was emphasized in bold green, tilted at a 45 degree angle and or sized up twice the side. 

All the worlds tilta-whirling around the page and only 2 buttons in the bottom options to change the size and emphasis. But NADA to fix it from being in a tilt. Not even pinching or re-sizing it fixed it. Real circus. 🙃🙃🙃 | I installed it 
Wanted to pay 
When I get to my card details, it kicks me out of the system, I had to turn off and on my phone a few times to reset

Then it turned down two cards, so I couldn’t pay 

Very strange program | It’s not free | I spent 3 hours on my anniversary editing and layering a video since I couldn’t get photos from an album and had to scroll for hours only to lose everything at the very last clip! I was so disappointed! | After new update the application doesn't
work on my iPhone I can't sign in when I
want to sign in it said try again in few minutes | Hello sunshine!!

YES☀️I’m always looking for tools to streamline the process for consistent content  marketing that aligns with our strategy for our clients.

I found the Captions APP TO BE a great systems  tool! To save time, build fun relevant content that is on trend and allows for branding to match our clients mission and message. 

Thank you!! | It’s alright because first the captions worked out really, really well, and I was going to export the video and it said I had to pay. I got really angry after that. I can’t even export my frickin video because I have to pay. That’s why this all gets a frickin two stra | This app is far more superior than the other apps that claim to have a good captioning system. Not only are the templates great but you can correct, add, and edit actions that the Ai got wrong without losing the animation quality. It makes editing a video on your phone so much easier! | The voice is not following the mouth. | As a new content creator, the app is easy to use and works very well. I’m not the most technologically savvy and I navigate the app with ease. | So I did get to put down my video when I did get to edit it good and it picked up my voice and stuff like that but when I tried to save the video when I tried to save the video, it said I had to pay even though I already said that I didn’t want to pay can you guys just fix the app?! 😡 | Everything the app does is amazing and there are only two updates that would make this a no brainer
 
1) the auto photos. I wish they would automatically fill the screen and I wish there was more control over what photos are picked. Like it just gives you a set of random photos. I wish I could click the photo and see other related images so I could quickly swap them. I also wish I could select all the photos and change the scale at the same time. This part of the app needs work. 

2)I think there should be an auto emoji caption template. You can add emojis now but it takes forever. I wish one template would be to caption the video but some words are replaced with emojis. | Only translate 5 minutes....I need 2 hours in the app iphone. The translation in Spanish needs to be improved with more varied words in Latin Spanish. | I can’t make a flipping video without paying money! | Nvm I was a misunderstanding | I just spend 3 hours trying to figure this stupid caption out just to find out i have to pay. like this app really makes enough money that can’t just let me download 1 video. DO NOT RECOMMEND. | This app is amazing except for the lack of some languages. Would you please try to add Mongolian? 😅 | After new update the application doesn’t work on my iPhone 15 I can’t sign in when I want to sign in it said something failed | I would try to use it to make videos but it wouldn’t make captions when I was talking. When I tried to make them myself it wouldn’t let me adjust the timing | I rate this a 1 because I have to buy a subscription to do anything, devs if you see this please change this | Trendy and easy to use! | I thought it was free to export but I didn’t know that it costed money so that’s why I give it a 1 star. | Didn’t recognize my speech accurate at all.
VERY off. Inputting Manually was a huge waste of time | Anytime, I’m adding subtitles or effects. I use this app exclusively. | This is honestly unbelievable. I figured I’d give it a show and it was extremely competent. And fast at that. Sheeesh A.I is something else! | There’s a limit to the number of AI shorts you can create. I’ve waited 5 days and still can’t create another one. This isn’t advertised before you pay $10 for a month of the service. I canceled my subscription. | Not as it is advertising . I am used to CapCut and I tried this app and I can tell you . THIS IS NOT A FRIENDLY APP! If the free version is very difficult and limited I can’t only image the paid version !! NOPE !! | This app works very accurately even in a difficult language like Farsi | The caption customization is unmatched. But I wa shocked how well the other AI features work, specifically AI eye contact. Once you get a hang of the editor the other features are easier to play with (sounds, zooms). Much prefer over CapCut already! | I tried out Captions and don’t get me wrong it is a game changer but it is glitchy and difficult to use as the app VEED is better imo in using and having more preferences. | The overall app is very easy to use. However, when exporting footage, the first few captions or first sentence do NOT export. I’ve updated the app and contacted support but nothing seems to work. Very frustrating when this is a paid app and it doesn’t even work. | I paid for an annual subscription in January. I’ve got a new phone. Captions won’t let me back in and tells me I need to buy another subscription. Then when I try to report the issue On discord, the discord server won’t allow me to confirm my phone number. I have no choice but to report this by leaving a bad review. | You could type in a topic and it would write a short script. Now you have to edit the script because some genius decided to have the AI now write an actual movie script like: “aerial shot of mountains as you talk about” etc between the actual script. How stupid.

Your response to my review has nothing to do with what I wrote. | So much more fun doing captions with the different font styles and the colors! | No complaints, A++ level quality, easy to use, worth the membership | I need this kind of tool for editing, and work! It’s not only super convenient but it makes my videos and ads etc look great and more professional! The subscription is so worth it, as are all of the features!

Reakce developera je sice pravda ale je potřeba se na to podivat z širšího pohledu a v souvislosti faktu.

Tak co je to za funkce a bezpecnostni nastaveni ktere mohou byt v androidu a v ios ne. Nebo je to tlak ze strany globalniho Erste ktera vytvorila novou verzi pro bohaté zákazníky z okolních zemí?

That’s really the only thing that’s kind of irritating but yea if u can help please do | Why fix something that wasn’t broken. Yes my app is up to date. I wish it wasn’t though because the UI is terrible now. Change it back or at least give us an option to change it back. Switching through servers and messages is terrible now. Discord use to be good. Fire the new devs making these terrible updates. | Amazing how you make the app uglier and harder to navigate with every update | Good | Its good for everything but calls on console, its choppy I cut out a lot and phone isnt any better, and I know its discord because I’ve tried other apps honestly just writing hoping they fix it >~< | I bought nitro and it said “It seems there’s been an error, try again.” Like wdym try again you have my money? So i tried again and unsubscribed then bought it again, and it didn’t give me my nitro again!!! Please fix this. | I’m trying to login but it keeps on saying this email has already been used when it has not. I just downloaded this app and on my phone it does not work. I use my phone number and I typed in the code and I hit verify but it doesn’t verify I’ve tried everything. I’ve even tried to log into my old account and it didn’t work so that might just be for me, but you could try if you want to | can yall fix the stupid issue on the ipad where it shows the emoji weirdly spaced out and doesnt show all the emojis in the emojis tab and then also doesn’t show up when im typing them out (like with colons) so i have to perfectly remember the emoji name to get it in my message | Idk if it is a bug or something but I love this app so much but now when im on a private call with my couple he can’t hear me but a can hear him, and this it’s happening for at least for more than a week. Please, hope you can fix this because I love to share with my friends on this app so much! | can u guys fr mute the ppl we block or hide their messages out of our view idc about “1 blocked message” i dont care to see them talk at all. it just makes everything looked cluttered and ugly | Just add back old layout more than half the people that use the app complain about new layout old layout was so comfortable to use everybody has said they want old desktop layout for mobile back | Great overall, one issue: when I join a call, one particular person is muted, it says it is by me. so I go to unmute them and it is greyed out. I have seen Reddit pages where people say that happened but no solution PLEASE FIX THIS! it has happened twice now | Look I got into discord FINALLY and I went into some servers but after like a hour it just says to verify myself. Like why do I have to verify myself. I put in my email and password and it said I’ll get mail. BUT I DIDNT GET ANY MAIL. I kept in resending BUT I DIDNT GET ANT MAIL. Just because of that it gets 4 stars. It’s still a good app it’s just so annoying that it keeps popping up in my screen. The community is nice and all and I was having a good time but then the verification screen popped up and I couldn’t do anything about it. | This is is pretty okay, even though is has had some downsides, like now. There is one problem in particular that I have, which is streaming. My Xbox sometimes will not load or start streaming to discord vc, and I have tried multiple ways to fix the issue, such as: Restarting both app and console, disconnecting and reconnecting the xbox connection to discord, checking the “online & privacy” setting, etc. None have worked so far, please look into this. Also, I would like to have an option for PS4 to have the streaming service too, unfair for only the PS5 to have vc option. | I‘ve have this app since 2021, it is absolutely amazing whether you have Nitro or not! Amazing for texting and having fun friend group calls. | BLUD IT NEEDS TO STEP UP ITS GAME | After the recent update my mobile notifications won’t work no matter what I do, I’ve reset them and prioritized the channels I need notifications from and it still won’t work | New mobile layout ruins the app with no way to revert | Just leave the UI alone. It was never one of your problems, until you decided to change it. Stop it. Leave things where they go. I can’t find anything anymore and gestures do random things whenever attempted. For the love of god. Stop.

“Go read about the new stuff!” No. I won’t. I’ve used discord since beta, I shouldn’t HAVE TO. | Should have an option to disable it and go back to the old UI | I’ve enjoyed the app for a while, it’s good for communication between large groups- however, with every coming update I keep hoping and keep getting disappointed. The mobile app is so extremely buggy these days that I’ve been tempted to delete it and instead use the browser version of discord on my phone which is obviously quite hard to work with on it’s own because it wasn’t made for phones. Well in the one that’s made for phones it’s hard to find the pins of threads at all. It’s extremely frustrating that one cannot search threads but instead has to search the channel. As well, any channels that share names might have their pins swapped so then you have to go into the channel settings and look at the pins through there. Finally, and the biggest cause for my frustration, is even when my phone’s rotation is locked, if I try to search a channel or look at it’s settings/members then the screen will rotate some random way. It doesn’t matter if I’m holding my phone straight, sideways, upside down, it will rotate, it is especially annoying when trying to find something quickly. | Go back to old layout please | Ive been a discord user since 2020 theres been tons of changes but this one this recent one is horrible and confusing. I used discord because i understand it and it isnt confusing. Congrats discord. I hate your app | Please update app there are bugs. Thank you. | WHY DID IT CHANGE IN THE FIRST PLACE!? | Every time I except a invite I keep getting send to the App Store despite me already having the discord because of this I haven’t been able to join a discord server for about two years now | So I got falsely reported by someone I knew 3 yrs ago for being a scammer, and they mass reported me. But they came to their senses and realized that I was NOT the one who did it, so they contacted discord and told them to not delete my acc. But discord went ahead and made me prove myself.
How ya might ask??? By buying at least $800 in gift cards. Not for myself, but for them. They promised me it was refundable. But the next day ( today), they claimed that the refund was error, and I had to pay another $500 fee to get the money back. Now they won’t even respond to me anymore. ATP im thinking I got scammed by discord themselves, and they’re not gonna refund my money, but gonna make me completely drain my bank account for them. 
And to add, I only have $500 so after I pay another $500, I got an even $0, no money to pay for gas to even go to work. I’m broke now, and can’t even get to work because of these ppl. 🤦🤦🤦🤦 | There been some lags with emojis from different apps,
My favorite emoji app was from fan made video game.
But every time I use it discord kicks me out please fix it. | Yea discord is AMAZING but I am going to keep this short just use IMessages | This new user interface for the emoji keyboard is not showing every single server emoji, even when i go to the server tab. I can’t access some of the emojis I pay MONEY to use. Please fix this as soon as possible, all emojis should show, not just 33 out of the 50 I have made. | I’m not sure what’s happened but discord does not seem optimized to run on ipad ios. Works fine on iphone, android and PC though… | I don’t give a $h!t about some stupid poll option, move the camera option back out of the photos so I can send them easier. | It’s an amazing app however my screen sharing doesn’t work anymore and I can’t seem to fix it at all | I’ve used discord for a few years and it always worked fine for me. I really enjoy it. Ever since the new UI update changed things around, my app on my phone has been incredibly buggy. It’s slower when switching between servers and messages. Whenever I’m in a call with someone, sometimes I can’t send messages. The entire keyboard disappears. Whenever an alarm goes off or I mute myself and then unmute myself, my discord audio just stops working. I am having to constantly close the app and restart it to get it to work now. I am not the only one having these issues, I’ve spoken to other people that also have these issues. Both on android and iphone. I’ve been waiting on them to fix these issues but it hasn’t happened yet so I figured I would write a review to let you know these things are happening. I love this app, please bring it back to being useable.

Edit: I keep my app regularly updated. It’s your fault discord, not mine. | Been a member of discord for 4 years haven’t had any issues but recently when me and my girlfriend get into a call, we cannot hear each other whatsoever. We’ve tried multiple things to fix it and found no success. If this problem wasn’t affecting us I would give discord 5 stars, I haven’t had an issues with it until now. | Discord is a great application to talk to your friends and make friends in different servers and the nitro features are also really good but today i bought the nitro subscription again but i didn’t got it if a discord administrator reading this please give me a refund or the nitro | I use discord on iPad and it has been unusably buggy with no signs of improvement, only getting worse, for over a MONTH. Every new update only adds more bugs and doesn’t fix any old ones. I am unable to properly select channels, the whole application randomly goes dark when I click on a different server, and (extremely disappointing as a nitro user) I am unable to select all the emojis from a server—I only have a limited list that seems to be selected at random. I am sick of discord’s terrible customer service and worsening quality. | this app is horrible , like banning someone for not having no money is crazy . | I often get lost in bigger servers, (especially roleplay servers) because the highlight thing stays stuck on the first channel I click, and when I click on other channels it doesn’t appear. | Buggy it’s glitches out servers making it look like nothing is there fix the problem please. | I’m trying to sign up but when it sends me my verification code it says a user already has the code | iOS 17.4, iPhone 15 Pro, can’t hear voice room’s sound, I tried rebooting my phone, checking if I accidentally open deafen mode, checking if Discord has enough permission form iPhone, checking if it’s my Bluetooth headphone’s problem, but nothing worked, so maybe it’s a incompatible problem? | They make a lot of unnecessary updates that can sometimes break the app.

Recently, about three updates ago and that hasn’t been changed: Gifs and videos posted in app no longer move or play while in a Discord call. This seems to only be an issue on the Mobile app, or on the Mobile iOS app. This can be extremely frustrating as I’m often in a call with my friends when they send certain gifs or videos that they’d like me to react to!

On top of that, they removed a feature where you could use emojis from a server you aren’t apart of if you have Nitro. This was a nice, quality feature for everyone. I’ve only seen disscontempt for the change and I share it as well, I add and make my own emojis and stickers for for my group chat. If anyone they send those emojis and stickers too sees that and likes them. I’m completely okay with them using those emojis and stickers! I’d rather that person enjoy my creations rather than have a silent random in my group chat that doesn’t wanna be there but is forced to just to be able to use my emojis/stickers!

Also. After the big update recently. Forcing a huge square to be present on the screen in mobile version while in the call, even if screenshare isn’t on; is extremely ugly and gets in the way a lot. I constantly have to move it around, accidentally press it when I’m trying to do something else, and find myself always repositioning it in odd positions when I want to take a screenshot :(

Besides these three issues, Discord seems to be on the up! Calls rarely ever drop anymore like they used to and I don’t find myself having many issues with it!

I truly love Discord. I don’t mean to be harsh. But these three things are important! And I want nothing but to see discord thrive! | I am a YouTuber and I use discord to talk to my friends, but no screen recorder can record a call while I am playing a game, when I talk to them about this issue, they say that it’s because discord doesn’t allow outside things from recording calls to be replayed, is this possible for you people to fix? If not, can you make a screen record option during a call so I can edit it together or something? That would be helpful! | I think that discord is very good except for when twitter links don’t work when it’s interactive | I love it because I can chat with the friends i met on steam and other stuff | I’m trying to verify my email and don’t work keep on saying reset my email and it still don’t work | Every time I send a image and try to go back into the dms I get kicked when I go up to the image. It’s annoying.. but the app is overall good. | I had my account disabled and despite contacting support repeatedly, they have not responded in over 3 weeks. Only get bot replies, can’t get through to a human. | The app opens dodgy links randomly from OFF-SCREEN without any clicks, user interaction, or prompt. This behavior is extremely dangerous.

I ordered 1000 for$9.99 and was charged $16.33 and then ordered 1500 for $14.99 and was charged $32.68. | Love the app, even when you check in daily you can get bonus points! | I love is | The plot of the stories is really good. Just wish it was more manageable to watch the most content at one time. And not so much recap on every video. This waste a lot of time. Over all I stay wanting to watch the next episode. | Kinda cheesy at times but very good …. Couldn’t wait to see the next episode! | ksufjfifnfktj | Need cheaper chapters. But I was hooked and couldn’t stop watching lol | I love this app because of the shows | Love the shorts Just wish you’d get more than 5 coins for watching ad that’s a minute long when each episode is 85 coins and it’s 75 episode per series at least | Love love love | Good app to use | I feel like it used to much money for a few episodes but overall it’s amazing! | i like the app but the only reason i have it is bc of the ads on tiktok if i didn’t keep seeing those then i wouldn’t have downloaded the app The only thing I don’t like is instead of paying to watch an episode I have to watch ads which I’m fine with watching ads but the fact that I can only watch five a day just kinda gets on my nerves because the one that I’m watching is really intriguing and it always leaves on cliffhangers so I’m really eager to watch and see what happens next but I can’t because I’ve already watched five episodes but other than that are pretty good app | Honestly I would love to find out more of the the first and only story I watched. However, after some calculations, I will not be participating in this Money Pit. 1700 coins (14.99) is equivalent to 20, one minute episodes. You can get coins to listen by watching a 35 second ad and then another ad shows after the episode. You can only do the 5 times in a day. A single episode is 85 coins. If you want to spent that much you might as well watch Netflix it’s cheaper and you can find movies with acting just as bad. It’s not worth it. The idea is awesome, the price and quality, not so much. | Great app | Best content ever | It is way overpriced! It cost $50 to watch one cheaply made movie. That’s outrageous when you go buy the newest highly rated movie on dvd or digital for $25 or less. You can watch it free with ads but it’ll only let you do that for 5 episodes each day. This is horrible because the episodes are only 1 minute long each. The app also glitches and steals some of your episodes that you can watch by watching an ad because it will say you used 5/5 ads before you even get to use them all. So far I have only been able to watch 4 episodes each day because of it glitching, and today I went to watch it and had 0/5 ads used and then clicked to watch it and the app froze. When it finally worked again it said I used 5/5 ads without using a single one. The storyline to the movie I was watching was good, but it’s obviously a cheap movie with unknown actors and you can even see their microphones in some episodes. It’s definitely not worth $50 to watch it, and I’ll never be able to finish all 90 episodes especially when I can’t even watch all of the free 5 (1 minute long episodes) each day. They need to do a $5-10/month subscription instead. It is definitely a ripoff the way it is now. | Love the story's | Considering other apps this is great you can get bonus and watch even more i genuinely like this app | Love this game | This is the best app I have ever used I just with the episode coins wasn’t used so fast and it’s always so easy to get hocked | Alr if you don’t mind the sorta bad acting and having only so many free episodes | I love your stories you get hooked on them. The only thing is that you got a buy minutes or points or wait till the next day does the only thing I don’t like. | It’s ok | Don’t download this app | Really good | Good | I like the story I’m watching but I paid $10 to get tokens and watched all the videos to unlock more parts of the story. I got all the way to episode 32 and went back to watch everything all together and then closed the app and I had to rewatch the videos to unlock chapters I’ve already watched. And I emailed the developers and I got no response. So now I have to rewatch over 15 videos to unlock up to where I was in the story. | If you like just watching quick videos while your bored or at a doctors office this is it! | I started watching a series and it stopped and plays the same episode every day and you have to buy coins to see more   We should at least get the next video daily | I love watching every drama ShortTV has and free episodes makes it even better!  I’m on this app everyday watching all my favorite dramas and do not go on a day without visiting the app.  It’s the best source of entertainment without having to watch an hour long episode!

Thanks ShortTV!

Soupharak D | Most of the videos keep you wanting to see more, love it | You just need a lot of coin and I’m not buying them | The stories are very good. The stories need to be longer, they're too short.  Also, all of the ads is very annoying. I just want to enjoy a good story without all of the extras. | Great stories! | I signed up and try to watch. The app crashes constantly. If you unlock episodes and don’t finish the series the same day it doesn’t remember the episodes are unlocked and you have to start over. Doesn’t matter if you login in or not, nothing saves.  For sure don’t spend $$ on anything because you will get nothing in return. | Love the shirts just wish it was a little longer for what I pay for. I get we all need to profit, just 85 coins for a minute is 😭 | It’s an amazing thing. It actually what it is but you have to earn coin with ads or you have to buy coins | You have to pay for EVERYTHING after the first couple free videos because coins are basically impossible to get without the purchase of them | If you wanna watch more than one episode you gotta buy coins. | Need bigger free coins . But love the stories and the videos make it great | I really like this but I wish it was all free | أحسنتم على هاذا البرنامج المميز | I absolutely love the stories especially Forbidden desires:alphas love it so good but there are so many adds | Why can’t we just watch adds to watch it I mean I get your trying to get money but like some people can buy it or have the money for it | I liked it until I exited app and it put me back at episode 8. I was unlocked to episode 30 after I paid money for coins. Not happy right now. Basically stole my money and the free bonuses because it put me back to episode 6. Which is why I spent money to get coins.",4.04545,22,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/70/92/33/709233fe-53d7-ada7-b2cd-0e5323b23bc2/8f24e08d-5f26-45b3-8e37-a4356f087c45__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/23/57/f7/2357f7cf-bf17-eaac-5e24-48be00675721/e19d3fde-0c8d-4cc5-9343-2c4b88ac4eed__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_02.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/87/9d/a6/879da601-f364-af40-03fe-2b726c044cf5/0357825c-20f4-4e74-b51a-b01a776b3ae8__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_03.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/dc/18/62/dc186202-6236-5954-2b1a-8188bf5a8ad1/0afa9cd2-e9a7-49af-a17c-ae0759a6e770__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_04.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/f1/d0/ce/f1d0cef9-473e-ea47-ef22-08a07b083085/8956c821-1fbd-47f6-b239-c2a45cb00acf__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_05.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/c0/a4/d0/c0a4d0b7-9f42-1b75-e1aa-ba09c7160c56/c6ec9905-4f00-4a51-9a78-bedbef6c5536__U82f1_U6587-1242x2208_06.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Although I get along in Czech, I wouldn’t mind an English translation on the app. That’s my only reason for 4 stars. It is an otherwise great banking app. | Výborný interface. Jednoduché, přesto bezpečné. | Vse prehledne, jednoduche, rychle!! | Jednoduchá aplikace, kde lze zvládnout to samé, co v bance. | At first I was a little bit reluctant to use the ap and was using the web. This often required multiple SMS codes and was slowing me down. Now I rarely use my desktop for banking. | Krasne a jednoduse a pritom bezpecna appka | This app is terrible. Many missing features. | Chybi, byla odstranena historie plateb coz je hrozne! | Vse je super az na zmenu, kterou jste nedavno udelali. Nemuhu se vratit do historie plateb vice nez asi 2 mesice! To je strasne spatne! Drive jsem
 mohla jit zpet treba 5 let. Chci a potrebuji mit celou historii zpristupnenu. Az to napravite, dostanete 5 hvezdicek. Dekuji! | Aplikace jako takova je velice fajn. Jen me totalne s**e vas pristup v tom, ze mate pocit, ze je treba neustale neco menit. Takze v momente, kdy si clovek konecne zvykne na predelany design, tak ho zase predelate. Posledni update je toho zarnym prikladem. Predelane je temer vse a je to k h***u! Zamyslete se a vylepsujte aplikaci tak, abyste nepridelavali problemy. Update jen proto aby byl update je na nic.... | Nakrmen reklamou jsem se jal zalozit si ucet, jednoduchy pruvodce jak tvrdi reklama se sice konal, naskenovani fotek vse OK zadani adres OK ovsem zmena data narozeni neni mozna neni mozne pokracovat tzn. po 3tim pokusu naprosta nechut dale neco zakladat a tak ma Airbank o jednoho zakaznika mene. | Ten obrázek lobby byl velice hezký. Koukat se na ty dva mi stačí v televizi. | Very happy with this app!! 
Super easy and very organized. | I do wish there was an English option, but it pushes me to learn Czech! | Implementace Touch ID trvala roky, rohlík o který nikdo nestál a ani jej nechce se objeví během par dní ..... Sbalení nabídkového menu není jeho skrytí! | Aplikace je přehledná a má téměř vše, co od MB potřebuji. Jen bych uvítal integraci touchID. | iPhone 6 vysel pred 18 mesici... | One of the best banking apps I've ever used both in US and Czech Republic. | Easy to use and very well organized! No problems at all. | Je to pěkná přehledá aplikace. 4* proto, protože vždy je co zlepšovat👍😄 | Skvělá aplikace, redesign se opravdu povedl. Nejhezčí app pro mobilní bankovnictví | Mám ipad a tato aplikace je nefunkční zadám reg.kód a hlásí, že je špatné. Takže se nemohu zaregistrovat abych otevřel hl stránku. Takže velmi potřebná aplikace, ale NA HOVNO!!!!!!!!!! | Nesrozumitelné popisky typu ""vyladili ji pro cestování časem"" jsou naprosto NEVHODNÉ pro finanční instituci! Jste banka nebo školka? Uživateli musí být jasné, co jste udělali a proč. | Skvela aplikace, jeste lepsi banka. | velky skok od prvni verze, konecne prizbusobena na iP5 a hlavne rychla, tak jak ma vypadat moderni app | Much much work it is needed on this app, but at least something what works! | Horrible UI, even worse UX, does not support iPhone 5 4-inch retina display. Looks like a wrapper around the web app and acts like it! From a native iOS App you should expect a native iOS experience, but this cr-app does not deliver it. Stick with the web app in Safari.

Things I Noticed After Testing:
- No multitasking support!
- Can't paste my password when I copy it from 1Password - what the ****? How do you expect me to remember multiple 18 character based passwords (uppercase & lowercase letters, symbols and numbers)?
- As I mentioned above the whole UX is horrendous! (wrong animations, slow feedback, etc.)

Using the web app through Safari is way more convenient! | Pomalé, některé věci nepřehledné. Od Air Bank jsem čekal mnohem víc. | Mediocre design and poor UX. This is not how it should look like...!!!",4.8737,79095,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/52/bd/6a/52bd6ad0-df10-6ed6-ff32-50e9e78b484d/48ca1e9b-4e60-4e95-914f-ba04d8835bd1_pay_991.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/96/93/f5/9693f52e-1186-f15d-ccd3-82c167157812/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e2/df/c9/e2dfc9c4-120f-7670-2dda-217109fc8c65/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ee/a4/54/eea45432-5bef-229f-f130-619310d16c7d/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/fc/55/35/fc5535d0-5287-d295-e013-5c43c5eb40e2/fef7fb1e-493c-4d55-b2e7-ced612faf55f_pay_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6b/89/ce/6b89cee7-379d-7263-78f8-b4162a35b3cf/0dcecffe-e95d-4262-b8d4-c6553e73753d_pay_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5d/0e/61/5d0e61de-724f-f314-346c-a46c935c97fa/7cd4c1fb-c01b-433f-bd9a-0a2d6aac6fe7_pay_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/59/24/94/5924945f-1b37-2a97-9a6e-a1595a5c73c7/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I’ll click music to play it and it will show that it is playing but not play (I do not use Bluetooth nor have my volume down at all) and if you try to skip a song or even pause it most of the time it doesn’t work. | I love music and you tube music is allowing me to play the different genre of music that I adore!!! 🥰 I'm going to love you tube music forever and a day🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥🔥💥💥🔥💥🧩🧩 | Best music service in my opinion. | I love the way I can watch the video too with the music and the sound quality is amazing. | I switched from Spotify to YouTube Music about a year ago and absolutely recommend it to anyone else who enjoys listening to music. It has all the desirable features of any music player and has a very simple, understandable, and helpful layout. The subscription of course carries across all devices, and is absolutely worth it if you’re an avid music-listener. I find myself a lot more content using it over Spotify as well, having many more hours of usage than I did before and makes it really worth the money. | Needs internet to even access your offline content like your paid music you paid for to use while your offline, Somehow it separates your google play music from your mp3 vs google play where they all were together You have to download each google play song separately, imagine if you have hundreds of songs vs downloading them all at once, you shouldn’t even have to download it if it’s already on your phone, this makes no sense! They are following apple with the Apple Music by making YouTube music

Ridiculous: 03/22 YouTube music replaced Google music, I paid a lot of money in buying MP3 from google music. Google transition, you download all the songs you paid for but the catch, the software only works on YouTube music! Now today, I find I can’t listen to many of the Songs I paid for! Because if you live in NYC and use the trains, many spots are offline and it says expired for offline listening, then it’s not a MP3 then! | I can get all kinds of music and videos here without interruptions. From dance music to how to dance videos. And I can download them for when I’m traveling and away from WiFi. Again, one of the few remaining reasonable priced deals around. | Very much appreciating the ad supported version to this app. YT music catalog is unrivaled when it comes to finding new music/artist, YT has captured every phase we went through over the years. Recommendations not only push popular artist, but also artist of whatever genre you search for. Lots of unreleased music/underground artists can be found here which makes the app the go to for someone like me with alternative taste. When it comes to saving the music I like, if the “liked” tap had more organization, such as alphabetically organizing every song or by date added, it would make YT music that much better vs scrolling through every song I’ve ever liked! | Can you please add equalizer to iOS because I need it 😭😭😭 | youtube music has helped me find songs and remixes i never would have found on spotify, not only is it a lot less restrictive on skips but it also allows you to listen to the song you look up when you look it up! overall in discovery and in use YT music is the most convenient and consistent app i’ve ever used for music. 
thank you youtube 
-Rylee | Can’t press little square. I HAVE TO TURN MY PHONE TO MAKE SCREEN GO BIG.

PLEASE FIX BORTOM RIGHT WHITE SQUARE FOR MUSIC VIDEOS OR I WILL LOSE MY SANITY!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK U NEXT PLZ!!!👽✊🏾🙏♒️😹🚀🔥🖖🎰🖖 | Downloading and removing needs to be fixed. Even deleting a song someone’s won’t delete. | It decent with as much as I pay it shouldn't lag as this bad | Have had no problems! 
I love how it keeps… my music! | It amazing there’s song that I like cause they are videos, but with this app you can play those song u like plus you have the whole YouTube songs inventory, it’s simple just amazing app | La música que me recomienda es justo lo que busco, me encanta esta aplicación ❤️ | Shuffle is a joke, I have thousands of songs in my playlist but it keeps repeating the same few | Stop changing my music it gets annoying I can’t hear my own music every time I play it’s changes with other songs that aren’t it I can’t find my music anymore it really frustrating just stop messing with my playlist | Everybody watches YouTube, but YouTube Music takes all my favorite songs (even the hard to find ones) and puts it in one app! It’s all right at the tip of my fingers and I absolutely love it! None of the other music apps, paid or free, even come close. | Every time I load up a song, artist, album, or playlist, it crashes every time I loaded it up on it, though. So yeah! Please fix it soon on that crash on that update please. Thanks! 😁

Device: iPod touch (7th generation)
iOS: 15.8.2 Device doesn’t update anymore, though. | Add YouTube music to Xbox series x please | There are several issues. For example,
1. when you tap on an artist, I want it to take me to their songs in MY library, not their whole discography! (Instead I have to go back and search their name, then tap “my library”.)
2. No EQ control, though I hear that’s been present in the Android version for quite a while now.
3. Play count would be nice for artists, albums, songs…
4. they should clean up the mess artists make by having a million versions of a song in different places. They should help the artists have a better organized collection. I don’t want to add a song to my library when it comes on shuffle, and then realize I already have three of it in my library from single version, album, extended album, explicit album, compilation album etc.
5. Name of the album would be nice to have too, when we are listen to a song. We could tap on it to see the rest of the album (just like tapping the artist’s name) instead of jumping through multiple steps to finally get to it.
6. When you go to album, it should be very easy to select “show me the songs from my library” or “show the whole thing.” | Yes, I know apps have to make some bank somehow, but why can I not play music in the background with YouTube music free? Spotify and SoundCloud both allow me to play music in the background for free, but not YouTube music—which I was interested in BECAUSE I was told it plays music in the background—. I mean yes, I totally get having adds in between songs because I don’t have premium, but forcing me to pay for my music to play in the background is something wild. This app does give you like two weeks of premium or whatever it is called, which is nice, but after that you have to pay which is stupid—when it comes to playing the songs without the app open on my screen—. If YouTube would just change that one thing, I would probably recommend the app at higher points but until then, 3 stars is all I can give. | I was just trying to listen to music but whenever I still have the app open but it just turns off and doesn’t play my music so that’s why it’s stupid | Best music platform!! You can find any songs, even the unofficial ones. | Mí me ha gustado bastante | Its like being in the club no pause just straight flowing with vibes | I love music in general but how YouTube music packages for the end user, amazing work.
Much appreciated. Lower the monthly though. | Love it the samples are a nice way to find music without searching and looking for hours on end and I love how you can go back and skip ahead in the song unlike some apps, no ads too which is amazing! So far I haven’t seen any bugs or glitches so yea 5 stars I highly recommend!! | I’m just glad no commercials 3-4 minutes in. | This is outrageous, They made something free into something that I have to pay monthly. That is being able to listen without needing to be in the app and being able to go to other apps while listening | It’s so great that I am going crazy | Always&Forever | I'm paying for YT Premium/Music and with every update they just introduce more bugs to make it less usable. Since two years I've not been able to listen to downloads on over 6 differen phones (android and iphones). Now playlists don't allow to play more than 20 songs of any playlists and only allow shuffle - you cant just listen to the songs in the order you added them. It's ridiculous. I hate spotify, but at least it works as promised so I have to switch back next month. Sad. Really sad to see. | First of all they ask for a whopping 14.99 bucks a month  like Jesus why not make it 7.99? Just so you can listen to music while your phone tablet or idk off and for ad free stuff jeez dude | I create playlist so that I can listen to the whole playlist, but every time I try to play my favorite playlist, it cuts out more than half of the playlist. It will not let me play my entire playlist not to mention the fact that it wants to censor every song that it recommends I don’t wanna listen to censored music, I don’t wanna listen to censored music, I don’t wanna listen to censored music. I hate YouTube if I didn’t have all of my stuff on YouTube I would delete the app right now. | It’s for the real music explorers. :) | I think we can agree that YouTube is the most comprehensive and best jukebox in the world. I love that you can listen to both studio releases, as well as artist originals, remixes/mashups, etc. 

Just one thing is missing,  which is better control over the audio output: crossfade option, equalizer, etc. | .. enjoying all the improved features, including ease and access to my favourite selections and genres 
love the compilation of annual updates…thank you very much 🙏🏾💙🦁 | Download times take forever. Probably a licensing issue, but it always seems to reload and re-download every time I login or use the app. This is especially annoying when I’m off-line such as getting on a plane because then I don’t have access to previously downloaded musictruly drives me insane. The reason I use this is because it comes free with YouTube premium | The app is good but I find myself playing the same music every so often | Over rated over priced and Spotify is better and don’t make all the songs clean. | The literally best especially if you pay for it | So to be able to USE my phone and play music is locked behind a paywall are you insane or just one of the greediest companies I’ve ever seen??????? I will not buy your terrible service in order to listen to music and play terraria at the same time. | A lot of bugs still, great quality of music, my downloads won’t ever fully download no matter how long I have my phone on | I love YouTube music app. Thank you yt.

RYCHLÉ A BEZPEČNÉ PŘIHLÁŠENÍ
Při aktivaci si nastavte vlastní S-PIN, kterým se budete přihlašovat a autorizovat všechny platby a operace. Jednoduše se přihlásíte a potvrdíte platby do 5000 Kč i pomocí Face ID nebo Touch ID.

VŠECHNY PRODUKTY NA JEDNOM MÍSTĚ
Na hlavní stránce naleznete základní přehled a informace o všech svých produktech a službách.

NEKONEČNÁ HISTORIE POHYBŮ
Všechny platby a karetní transakce naleznete ve Vaší transakční historii ihned po jejich provedení. Pro lepší orientaci většina obsahuje i logo obchodníka a má přiřazenou kategorii.

JEDNODUCHÉ DOMÁCÍ PLATBY
Nevyplňujte složité formuláře. Příjemce vyberte ze seznamu těch nejčastějších. Nebo použijte QR kód pro jednodušší vyplnění parametrů platby. Platbu mezi vlastními účty můžete provést tak, že na hlavní stránce podržíte prst na jednom z účtů a přetáhnete jej na jiný účet.

MÁTE PŘEHLED, ZA CO NEJVÍC UTRÁCÍTE
Nejen ke karetním transakcím automaticky přiřazujeme jejich kategorie. Kompletní přehled výdajů v jednotlivých kategoriích za daný měsíc si pak můžete zobrazit v přehledném grafu.

Vyhodte lidi kteri jsou za ten paskvil zodpovedni. Nova app je absolutne neprehledny a chaoticky vytvor, ktery snad nemuzete myslet vazne. Je mi z toho soufl! | Docela nepříjemná chyba. Platba z účtu na účet. Dám změnit zdrojový účet, vyberu jiný a zároveň s touto změnou se změní kód banky u cílového účtu na  kód zdrojového. Jinak jako klient equa bank musím říct že aplikaci měli lepší. | I don’t have iOS 15.  The app download says it will load last compatible version but it won’t and I can’t find any way to upload the correct version.  And until then I am shut out of my online banking.  Fix your app download interface!! | I had trouble eKonto not showing English for many days. During that period, I was unable to make any transaction. | [Edit] After my initial review, they fixed the issues. Everything runs well and English is functional again. Thanks for the quick fix, devs. (Original review:) Since the last update, the app will not revert back to English, despite my settings being set to English. The app also crashes often. | This was the best bank application I had ever used. But a new update was installed on my phone a few days ago and, since then, the application will not display information in English — only in Czech. I am an expat living here since about two years and, unfortunately I do not understand enough Czech to navigate this app. So this is really a serious problem for me. | This is the best Bank app that I have used. It very easy and intuitive, and support with a Bank rep is always available when needed. | Whether you’re checking your account balance at the register, or trying to send money to a friend, or just going over your accounts at home at 7:30 on a Wednesday, there’s no time when RB isn’t likely to suddenly not work on your mobile phone!

Funguje velmi jednoduše, velmi přehledně. Ovládání je skvěle intuitivní. Díky za ni 👌🙏 | Awesome app | After the latest update, I cannot write 4 or 5 digits number to the ‘amount’ section. It always converts it back to x CZK or xx CZK. I cannot understand how bank is releasing this update without checking one of the core functionalities... It takes me 5 minutes to send money from my account.

Edit: with the latest update, they corrected their mistake. Only after 17 days. Increasing stars from 1 to 3. | Testujete tu aplikaci před vydáním? Jak je možné, že od začátku co nabízíte informace o platbách formou notifikací, nefunguje u těchto notifikací zvuk?! Testováno na více zařízeních s více účty. | - Když mě aplikace po nějaké době odhlásí, protože byla dlouho na pozadí, tak nepotřebuji potvrzovat dialog, který mě informuje o něčem co každý vidí na první pohled.

- Verze pro iPad je nově bohužel kompletně stejná jako pro telefon, pouze zvětšená. Aplikace by měla být optimalizovaná pro zařízení na kterém běží.

- Aplikace je zbugovaná (timeouty, popisky)

- Chybí důležité informace (např. mohu si deaktivovat cestovní pojištění u karty, ale nemohu zjistit jaké pojištění tam vlastně mám a kolik za něj platím ...)

- Aplikace není moc přehledná, působí dost přeplácaně, speciálně v porovnání s konkurencí jako Revolut ... | Mam novy ipad (ten co vysel v listopadu) a aplikace je na nem hodne rozbita, funguje jen v portrait modu. | Konečně aplikace může začít konkurovat aplikácím ostatních bank! Nová podoba se povedla! | How is it possible to make your job worse and worse? The home page of the new interface is stupidly filled by the absolutely unusable information. WHY did you make SO SMALL fonts? To make for your clients maximum inconvenience? RB should fire ASAP these IT morons to keep its good reputation! | Po novém updatu instantne aplikace spadne po spuštění. | Chci zpet puvodni verzi!!!

Just like Docs and Slides, so many uses and so easy to edit. Google Sheets is just overall useful. | So hard to use. Where is the currency button? Can’t drag down cells to copy automatically. Can’t recognize patterns when trying to drag two cells. | Helpful for RSVP list.  Maureen | Awesome tool | Google wants you to use the app instead because they won’t allow you to use the browser version. The app won’t even let you split screen view. | Years of trying to improve time management skills has finally become obvious to me at least this is the place that integrates with EVERYTHING & EVERYONE!

If wasn't even weeks ago that CRM’s. Portals, CMS’s, Industry developed apps for efficiency were being developed & still be developed sold & used.

With some exceptions of course to be realistic & totally truthful Google Workspace along with all the other complimentary apps, tools, assets, attributes, Beta Testing, accommodations, schedulng, tracking using all the strictest business best practices of course is obvious to me that everything that any person or AI computer can think of realistic or not is already being used by those who see this is the future now. | It working beautiful for me | I use sheets to track my work outs. Every day sheets bugs out. When I lock my phone and open back to the app a lot of the time when I go to select a cell it will select one like 3 of 4 cells down. Won’t unbug until I close the app. Really annoying. | Love that I can use on all my devices and very similar to excel. I also love that it’s free, really free not fake news free, lol! But my only negative is you can’t add images, and if you can I can not figure out how. This is great software but not as intuitive as excel, though it has many similarities.

Update: It’s been glitchy adding formulas (they are erroring out,  formula is correct and worked in some cells and not in others) and with data sort drop down is glitching looks like background coding issue giving random symbols and sporadic letters and numbers but only in some cells, other data sorts are working this is all within the same spreadsheet. | App doesn’t allow you to set the number of decimal places after you have formatted the cells to numeric | Horrible, hard to use on phone. Not intuitive or user friendly. | You can’t up load to zoom there is no 
Limit no tap zoom
Email
Or any thing 
It’s not easy to up load sorting a meeting 
And share | برنامج جيد | Muy buena herramienta para hacer mis tablas | Please add the option to remove duplicates. It is not on the mobile app but on the computer version. | I use Google Sheets and post them in a Google website where students can check them and see weekly updates.  The data on the worksheets have links to websites. Win Win for everyone. | Más fácil que excel | Love this app | User friendly. | Amazing service | I really enjoy using it in my note taking .It helps organize my business and personal matters in an order I can then share with my family as needed. | it’s pretty good i guess but i wonder why i can’t format spreadsheets :/ i just want to easily make the rows alternating colors…. | I use Google Sheets every day, and every day I force quit the app 3-5 times because of inexplicable glitches and bugs. That has remained constant across the past year, through many app updates and versions. If it were a random app from a small developer, I would chalk it up to normal cost of doing business, but this is Alphabet—if any company on earth should solve bugs, it is them.

About 10% of the time when open a sheet, I see no fields populated, only highlighted colors. I have to force quit the app and reload to see the data. Most frequently, there are glitches when you try to toggle quickly between editing multiple fields. I often cannot edit a field after selecting it, or close the editor after entering data. In both cases, I have to force quit and reload the app.

Again, it’s a powerful and useful app, but it feels like freeware somebody made in their garage, not a mainstay Google product. After so long, these should be high-priority fixes. | I tried to put a simple math formula =(2+5)/(8+3) and it wouldn’t appear. Restarted the app then now the app will crash everytime i try to open that sheet. Terrible | Sheet still needs a lot of work | Very simple and can use from anywhere | I have basic requirements so I've not used many of the available features. But I have no complaints whatsoever. I like being able to access my Google Sheets from whatever device I happen to be using and from any of my business travel destinations. | Very good | Great | it works okay.

	I was using it for a school project and it was difficult to use but, not terrible.  The typing method is weird because you type in a small box at the bottom of the screen but, your text shows up where ever you want. The boxes are annoying and finicky and copying can be challenging.

Going to try Lift. | I used to ride Uber 5-10 times a week and then Covid hit. I’ve started riding again more frequently and was confused on why, even short rides are so much higher. Never looked into it much but it definitely returned me many times. I finally decided to look and it’s the booking fee. I know cost of business is high but I’m sure this could be brought down. Maybe not. But this is what deters me or makes me look at Lyft, which I did use almost exclusively after the pandemic due to lower costs. Honest feedback which I think you want but again I know costs have gone up more than I care to calculate cause I’ve looked at my grocery, rent, internet and other bills. | Ed was a fantastic driver who got us home safe and sound.  He’s the reason why people use Uber for their go to when needing a ride. | Walter is great. We stopped and had some BG fries and his poor car smelled so bad with the fast food. He was a gentleman and just said he would deal with it later. Great conversation and super kind! | Uber needs to fix the situation at Mexican airports, can’t catch it at designated spots because of the national guard harassing drivers and patrons having to walk outside airport premises. | Got me home quick and safe | Brett was amazing. I left my phone in his car and he drove all the way up to the house we were staying at to deliver it. Highly recommend Brett -  he will always take care of you. | This app is terrible when it comes to customer service I bought a Uber card and redeemed it like the instructions said when I went to try and request a trip the it wouldn’t let me and it keep charging my other card. I tried talking to customer and there talking about there nothing they can do so now I have money (uber cash) just sitting there that I can’t use 🤦🏾‍♀️ | Awesome convo with driver, and great experience! Looking forward to using Uber more often with drivers like this! | I had a great Uber ride. | Kandi was amazing. This was my husband’s first Uber ride. He wasn’t to keen on the idea. But after riding with Kandi, he’s changed his mind about using Uber. She was prompted and very courteous and her car was super clean. Thank you Kandi’s keep up the good work. | They will change the price you paid hours after which is stupid I already paid for a certain price they shouldn’t be charging it after I purchased it | Was a short but wonderful experience | The app outright lies about pickup time. It’s blatantly false advertising. Eventually, they will get sued. I will not tip until they stop. | Great service | En realidad Uber es una app que yo no le recomendaría a nadie porque supuestamente los viajes son económicos y es todo menos eso, uno se tarda hora esperando a que las tarifas bajen y que alguien acepte el viaje, ya no es lo mismo de antes | Suadd bester Fahrer in Heidelberg!!! | I waitting very much for research driver | Had a delivery that should’ve been easy. Just about 5 blocks. The driver told me to calm down when she was claiming to be right in front of my place when she wasn’t. She asked for a pin. I gave it to her and then she drove off. Uber Eats customer service told me basically tough luck refused to refund me for and hung up. Terrible terrible terrible service. | Needed to get the Airport quickly / safely, and that he did well. Not to mention the conversation was great! | They have always been great ! | It’s an app that barely works, over charges for every ride and steals your money. Terrible I don’t think it should exist anymore. | How I know he stole my item ? Because when I called him he looked and confirmed he found it it was in a matter of minutes so no one else could had possible got in the back of the car because unless they were a block away. Like I said he confirmed he found it . | Carlos was so nice, so friendly, informative. He was great! | Marie was superb. Her car is immaculate!! | I made a new friend with Collin as my driver. Very thoughtful and helpful. | Consistent clean vehicles and great professional drivers.

you.",4.84603,29584,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/d9/f7/a7/d9f7a778-a05c-6f75-3a7c-1473748a712e/357621e1-1cee-4b4f-ae58-759922a08475_SS01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/43/3e/d1/433ed1dd-7cfa-9ae2-8ada-a860db1c0aa4/8c0e6f37-e44d-46cf-9a22-d86037cbefa7_SS02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4a/59/20/4a592011-134e-8e68-c9db-33e1b7e42646/f1d3a7b3-7342-4218-bc3d-2f4260c71c8e_SS03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/97/60/07/97600710-5cae-78b0-407c-cd0dd4e347f4/382f3d03-74f2-47c4-91d1-4ebc1825f004_SS04-1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/3f/be/fa/3fbefa78-3588-f89c-bc7b-f65096fa5a42/7c554cc8-80d9-4b19-ac58-a2eb2bca39d4_SS04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/68/73/20/68732088-2fc9-37a3-fefe-c1cda61eed6a/361bcf04-d64a-45e8-a141-93612e7f3830_SS05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/72/7e/33/727e33b9-8a27-bfb5-8800-37d87b987114/c44585b3-4084-4497-95e8-e21a8c6b5fa6_SS05-1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/f6/8d/3c/f68d3c91-9c82-df53-ad2f-468555f61c17/43edbcb3-7c25-4d3d-a515-c871b566534d_SS06.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1d/e9/c9/1de9c976-f8d8-24bb-6330-7b4791ad2abc/70ea1cf5-5331-4c76-9f99-a6926f4f9b6b_1.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/3f/7a/cc/3f7acc78-2669-daf7-eb29-5085fb51f9f2/6f6974c4-0dbc-46e9-9a48-9936d2a578d5_2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9d/48/70/9d4870a5-e84f-b687-fc9d-d35349ad2b51/b9f8908b-d363-4428-8ddc-1e2be3b01ab6_3.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/87/54/18/87541805-aeb0-9bee-1cd6-edde04122e1b/fc833a0f-47de-4909-8d38-8d1cca060c76_4.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b7/4e/ed/b74eed6b-376a-e934-42c5-37d7afb58ca9/2eeb9070-e862-412b-af1e-9b880c35e5bf_5.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/85/a2/2c/85a22ca4-439c-d957-85f0-2c73de0081bf/e1136fea-67e8-43da-a015-1302101a43b9_6.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/19/c1/d5/19c1d50b-b1d7-09e2-ae5f-63390bef2199/f83a3dd3-dfdc-4b72-afc1-ff3f1d221db1_7.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/56/8d/75/568d7533-88d3-8905-ad38-9c5bbe127076/5096300f-d82f-4cac-b838-c19763d2fddd_8.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCell

Suddenly I started getting EasyPark charges to my credit card this year. I cannot access my account because their MFA won’t send me text messages and they refuse to refund the charges. | Terrible app, stay away from this app at all costs.  Apple pay does not work, nor does credit card | I visited Iceland in June of 2023. As of January 2024, I’m still getting charges on my credit card. I emailed the company asking for help, and they never replied back. | Unfortunately only 1 star here, no support at all. Private account is working perfectly.
Was multiple time contacted by sell department regarding open business account, now when I decided to open one, have issue to setup and no one willing to help. Try to call, the staff on the phone ask me to send email. Send email, no answer.
Sad and disappointing. | Entered my phone number, and then spent 10 minutes entering and re-entering different card numbers, and every time it says fraud. | My card was removed from the app. It’s impossible to add new card. Please fix it. | I’ve tried opening new accounts with multiple credit cards and phone numbers and still no luck. Please fix. | EasyPark is really a good App and I would have rated it higher except for one thing that could be easily corrected.  
You have to be careful if you use the very useful camera feature with a car once it is no longer in your possession  - for instance after you finished renting the car or you sold the car.  If you don’t delete the license plate from the App you will pay for the next renter’s parking. 
I wish that the App made this clearer at the time I added the license plate rather than relying on their terms and conditions to inform me.   It would be even better if the camera triggered a request to my App to approve the parking first and not automatically bill. The parking App Pango has such controls built in . | The EasyPark app and system make parking in various cities throughout Europe a breeze. Not needing to worry about carrying around enough change for the meters is wonderful! | I used the app in Italy in a rental car. I still get charged on my card 3 months later by probably somebody using the rental and get automatic bills by the camera  recognizing the license plate. | A very good app. Easy to setup and use. Very good customer service. | The app works very smoothly. I love the ever-present countdown timer on the dynamic island.  Very slick! | Very smart app. Makes parking in Iceland super easy | Foreningers have to buy a lot of roaming data just to park… more expensive than parking ticket itself | Need a membership to use the app. No thanks | I visited Iceland for 3 days and used this app successfully during our trip. Returned to the U.S. on March 31. Today is August 16. This is the second time now I’m being charged for whatever strangers out there that rented the same car we did (same plate) after we returned home.

Can’t login to my account. It doesn’t allow me to reset my password. I never received the security text code the app says it’s sending to my phone. Zero options for English speakers to get assistance through customer service. I am being forced to file a dispute with my credit card. Absolutely do NOT recommend this app for tourists using rental cars. | Very disappointing. It just sits and displays a turning circle at a phone number screen. Don’t count on it in Strasberg. | The app wants to send a text message with a code to my American number and the text never arrives.

Called customer support and they said many have called about the same thing and they didn’t have a fix for it.

I have also emailed customer support but they never replies back to my emails. | Wonderful invention! | So much better than trying to navigate a payment at the meter. Can add or stop to the meter remotely. | The only app that declining all my cards | I downloaded the app, entered my phone number and I am not getting sent the verification code.

There is no way to get help from customer service - there is not an English chat bot nor an email address.

Very frustrating. | The add payment method page will not load. With that I won’t be using the app. | There is a quirk in the EasyPark system that causes their system to create a double charge the first time you use them. We were in Tromso, Norway and the only parking near the Polar Museum was operated by EasyPark. We pulled into the lot and downloaded the app. We then started the online meter for our parking. We also used it that same day when we parked at Polaris, the aquarium in Tromso. EasyPark charged our credit card for both parking activations. After we got home Hertz then attempted to charge us for the same parking; I showed them that I had already paid but they said EasyPark would not reimburse them for their charge. I contacted EasyPark and this is what they said:
Hi James.
Thanks for your inquiry.
The space in the license plate has no meaning and does not affect the parking registration as the camera systems/controllers also do not register them. 
From what I can see here, you have been read in on camera at Pellerinbryggene where you actually were, and then you've gone ahead and manually started a parking in a place you weren't. Had you had camera parking enabled in your own app, it would not have been read in on hertz's account, but your own. It is your own responsibility to make sure your parkings are started at the correct place, as the system will not know it outside of cameras.
I am sorry we cannot help you with this.
Have a nice day.

To translate Patrick's response: we can double charge you because before you activated the parking on the app our camera registered your license plate. That is correct, I pulled into the parking lot, downloaded the app, and started the parking BUT because I had not registered the license plate before entering the lot, they went ahead and charged Hertz as the car belonged to them. | Son unos estafadores. De la nada te están cobrando una suscripción y cuando la quieres cancelar te cobran dos meses porque según ellos es lo que dicen sus términos y condiciones en los cuales solo aparece un mes. Les recomienda que utilicen cualquier otra app para parking.

Su servicio por correo tarda una semana en contestar si contestan y el servicio por teléfono te hacen esperar 15 minutos para no poderte dar ninguna solución | Visited Iceland last summer. Discovered that my credit card is still being charged whenever the rental car is parked in fee zones since then. The app does not allow you to remove your credit card, only update it. | I downloaded the app to park on the street, I adjusted my time for 6 hours, and discovered that I have instead selected 180 hrs. When I pressed stop parking, it gives me an error. When I try deleting the account, it says I can’t delete it because of the ongoing parking session. I am no longer parked at the location but am still being charged money. | What a great way to park and manage our time.  This makes it so easy for me.  Thank you | I downloaded this app while traveling in Europe.  The app asks you to link your PayPal account.  DO NOT DO THIS.  They won’t tell you that you are agreeing to prepay for parking whether you use it or not.  I did not use the service and these scammers charged my PayPal account €31.40.   I tried to dispute it but PayPal sided with these guys.  I was supposed to provide a copy of the user agreement as if I had access to such a thing.  Stay away from this scam.  You’ve been warned. | First asked me for a previously used license plate to activate the account. I’ve always used rental cars so had not idea. Deleted account and trying to register again, but when I put it my UK phone number and select Australia as the parking country, nothing happens. I don’t understand why they can’t just do regular accounts like everybody else. | Easy Park is a great app. It was they only one out there that let us - US citizens - pay for parking - easy to use, easy to extend - LOVED IT - until our acct was hacked. Two weeks after we left The Netherlands our credit card was being used daily for some pretty expensive parking and my phone number that I use had been changed. Had to cancel the credit card and get a new one. Easy Park needs to up their security. We only used the app once in The Hague. | I used it multiple days a week without a problem and loved the convenience. However, since a little over a week I all the sudden cannot even get into the app.  The app screen opens asking for my phone number to send a confirmation code to. I never receive the code and there’s no other way to get back into the app. There seriously should be some sort of way to trouble shoot or work around not receiving the text. I’m typing in the correct phone number and country code, I’ve checked countless times.

Super frustrating. 
So I’m back to having to use coins to pay for parking the old fashion way. | Makes parking so much easier with no coins or over payment! Thanks 👍🏾🙏🏾👍🏾 | I find EasyPark easy to use and adjust time as needed.  I appreciate partnerships like QPARK, where EasyPark can be used in place.  If I am unsure whether I need to use EasyPark in an area, I launch the software and it will either show me a pop up of the parking space number so I can set the parking time or it will tell me there is no EasyPark parking option in that area. | So many steps and then the verification email won’t show up right away. Frustrating when you just want to get going and have to spend 10m signing up to just pay for simple parking. Can’t you just accept Apple Pay with no sign up necessary?! Please make this easier. 

Plus you can only sign up with an address from a handful of European countries. | This is a simple and very functional app that avoids the problem of lacking change for parking meters. The ability to add or delete time is genius. | I’m from the United States with a US cell number parking in Switzerland being charged in Swiss Francs and they are billing my PayPal in Norwegian Kroner? Currency exchange fees add up quickly. | (in addition to easy, also extremely reliable offering high confidence of use” | If you’re traveling and happen to be switching rental cars now and then, which is pretty common on trips in foreign countries, please BE AWARE that you need to make sure to change the registration number for the car in the app. If you forget to do this, you’re TOTALLY SCREWED. I paid for parking, but we had just switched to a different rental car and I forgot to change the registration number in the app. I got a slip on my car window telling me I owed them a fine that was over 3x the amount of the parking. I submitted a complaint saying I had actually paid, just under a different registration number and I gave them that number, but no, that’s my fault and I have to pay the fine. PLUS, they’re keeping what I paid for parking under the wrong registration number!??? How is that fair?? Poor business practice and extremely unforgiving. I PAID FOR PARKING!! | Het bedrijf blokkeert direct je (zakelijke) account als een betaling mislukt. Dat is niet zoals het zou horen.

App was working as intended but now it won’t let me make any payments. Tried reinstalling and it never sends and confirmation codes to add a new account. 

Found a backwards way through their website to create an account and now it won’t take any of the credit card info I was using before. 

Seems like a server-side issue. | It used to work, but I got signed out and I’m unable get back in. The issue is that I don’t get the SMS to verify my phone number. | App is supposed to be charging regular price in Zurich, not 15% extra. Zurich plates, Zurich address, Zurich phone number, Zurich parking place…. But app still thinks I am not in an area with the no-surcharge pricing. Please fix. | Très pratique et facile! | good app if it would work but it doesn’t allow me to perform the payment with apple pay for some reason (Apple pay is set up properly on my phone and works for other services). Neither does it allow me to just add a credit card.
I get this error since at least 6 months. | We have successfully downloaded the app, everything went well, till we started the parking: an  unhandled error occurred, please try again.. yeah, it’s really “easy”park.. thanks | Installed the app, easy breezy.

Stockholm, there is a problem with your basic app function. | Went to Iceland on vacation and returned to
the US. Unfortunately, I forgot my password. I tried using the password recovery numerous times and I have received an sms message.

“Very impressed. While not perfect, it can distinguish with high accuracy between different species in our collection of rare plants. It can even recognize down to cultivar sometimes-amazing. Amazed how it can work with any photo and it will give recognition a go-with impressive accuracy.”

The novelty.  The usefulness.  The information.  The poetry.  The history.  The photos.  The tips.  The awesomeness doesn’t stop.  I’ve been using the free part for years but I’m buying it today because the developers deserve it.  Thank you and keep on working 💕 | Three years ago this tree was cut down and every once in a while shoot comes up and is cut down. But now we have leaves to identify. This tree really wants to live maybe I can get the new owner to OK that. Thanks Elfriede | I love this app! Too expensive to justify having it now. Bring back the free version please? Some of us are poor 😅 | A friend told me about this App. It’s not the first plant ID I’ve used, but it is the best!  It helps identify invasive plants and weeds in my yard & garden, as well as any plants I find while hiking. And it’s very easy to use and mostly very accurate. Highly recommend! | This is a very good app. It is fast. Let me know what I’ve got growing in my yard or in my garden. Thanks keep up the great work. | If they would fix the water reminder area I would give it 5 stars. 

Today is showing a task I completed a few days ago, but the 5 things I need today have to be hunted. Not good if you are depending on their at-a-glance reminder. 

That said, Plant ID and care information is spot on and I use it a lot. 

Great App, but Developers…please fix the reminder area. | I’ve been using this app for several years and love it. It’s always accurate and very quick with the results. | I love it I just think it needs to be free😊 | Has helped me so many times in my “older” garden identifying so many vintage flowers & plantings ❣️ | I am a newbie gardener.  The app has made my plant and location choices better in not just identifying plants, but in providing size, care and pictures at various stages of growth. | Good God | I will answer or continue with my review once I get the answer to my question. I am stumped. I have spider rats that are curling around the root system, and I don’t know how to get them to straighten up or get the roots the plant system to be upright, so that I can get one in the soil and one in the air. | This app is one of the best apps i have on my phone!! It tells you if a plant is poisonous,sick,or healthy!!! It is one of the best apps ever!!! It tells you what species it is what type of plant it is it’s just…AMAIZING | Great tool for the landscape industry. Must have if not for work then educational. | Very helpful app | Details of care may be somewhat wrong. | I have found this app to be extremely helpful in determining plants, whether they are weed, tree or what not.  It’s helped determine what needs to go and for the flowers, it helps provide info to tend to them.  I recommend this app very much. | If identifying a common plant, it seems to do fairly well… however, all too often, it will give more than one plant ID for the very same plant. It’s very frustrating! With this type of inconsistency, I’m left not knowing to leave a plant in the ground… or, pull it. | It’s cool | Been using this app exclusively since its launch. I’ve tried other apps here and there just to see how they compare and this one is far superior. Still won’t identify fungus, mushrooms, mold, etc but I understand why as well. It’s very handy to have and I literally use this daily. It has given me a greater love and appreciation for plants. Thank you.
Great app and it has definitely saved me from Virginia Creeper vs Poison Ivy. Gets a little quirky when there are other plants nearby. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is it won’t identify fungi. I wish it would let me know what was safe and wasn’t. I had my dog get a hold of a mushroom and I wanted to know if it was safe or not. It would be much quicker to look it up here than Google. Also I wish this app would say it is this but if not it might be... sometimes I know it’s not a certain plant but it keeps saying it is. Easy to use and nice to have when you are hiking or gardening. | This app is very helpful regarding education for your property | Simply one of the most amazing apps i’ve ever used & purchased.  It’s ability to identify and give you all of the info you need on any plant, tree, etc. is amazing.  Throw in the light meter and this app will turn your brown thumb green! | Awesomely helpful and informative | I love the app. The identification is spot on and amazing. The ability to create garden and learn about your plants is splendid. It has so many features that it is an incredible deal.

However, I bought the family plan to share with my friends that also love plants and could get plenty of use out of it. I did not know that that required making a family sharing plan with Apple. I was hoping for a separate system that allowed me to individually select who I wanted to share with. This was not, explicitly stated when I went to purchase 🙁 | This is one of the most valuable apps I have ever seen, and I’m grateful to have it you can’t go wrong with it | I’ve had Picture This for at least 5 years, I think, and it only gets better with each update. I have introduced so many friends and strangers to it and they are also amazed at how well it works!
First of all the few plants I had when I added it are mostly thriving where in the past most would be dead and replaced with others that probably wouldn’t make it. 
Second I’ve become brave enough to branch out of my cactus/succulent zone to orchids and houseplants. 
Now I’m starting a butterfly garden with both container and in ground plants to attract butterflies and hummingbirds!  
My husband uses it too for his vegetable garden!
The only problem I’ve had with Picture This is that it doesn’t recognize my Rainbow Eucalyptus tree!!! | Is this app free? I searched for FREE plant identifier apps and yours came up | Hard to know whether the library is limited or pics just don’t provide the detail needed but so far it’s 1 for 4 in ID accuracy. Need more time with the newer version of this app to compare with others. This used to be a really simple app but has morphed to be maybe too many things. Still, a year later it can’t identify one of my succulents correctly. Also has me overwatering (volume not frequency) one of my older indoor plants. The light suggestions are great, and nothing’s dying (because I have common sense) due to the mis-ID’s or watering issues, but I’m on the hunt for a better app if there is one. | I really like this app. I do not hve a green thumb so I need all try the help I can get. This site is so right on the money and worth every cent. I don't have a plant store handy so this is my go to-
Thanks so much for helping my pp l as nts stay healthy!💕 | No te da el diagnóstico de tu planta enferma si no pagas, tienes que suscribirte para obtener el diagnóstico | Wanted to love this. But have trouble ever getting it to work. I try to take pictures and it freezes and closes out. | It’s a great app overall but I have to buy premium to see basic facts about the plant and it’s pretty annoying | Used to be able to diagnose what was wrong with plants and learn how to treat them for free. Now that feature is locked behind a subscription. I no longer have any use for this app. | The care and nurturing in this app is 100% correct as is all the plant identification! Worth every dime! | I am a forager of medicinal plants and this app is so useful ! Not only does it help me verify plants, it helps me to identify plants I don’t know. On top of that, I use it to help me with the care of my garden and indoor plants. This app really helps me get the info I need without having to search a lot of other websites. | This app was 0 for 3 on correct ID of trees | How long do I have to wait after I pay money which it's been days and I show that I'm subscribed and I got a confirmation that it was paid do I actually get access to this app? It keeps taking me back to the subscription page every time I open it, it won't let me go any further... | What did you do to this wonderful app!!?!  You took away all the plant info so you have to pay for premium just for simple info. This was great. Don’t know when it was updated but it certainly is less useful than it originally was ! | So when I took a picture of a thing of shredded cheese it said it was a poisonous fungus then I did the cheese again and it said it was a peony. Next I did a picture of my mom and it said she was a coontie and needed attention. Then I did a picture of my cheese ravioli and it said it was durian. So I can’t imagine this app is accurate. I gave it a 2 because it was funny. | This app not only identifies any plant I show it, but it tells me if it’s healthy, how to care for, how to propagate.  Now I know the names of all the teensy wildflowers and the
various ferns on my daily walk. | I use Picture This to identify weeds in my garden, although it is good at identifying flowers and other things in the garden and around the house as well. | I have so much fun learning about plants and trees and flowers when exploring new areas. | Living close to Longwood Gardens, this app is a blast to use as we stroll the grounds.  I’d give the photo ID a 95% success rate, and usually when it misidentifies a plant it’s because the picture you took wasn’t the best. | It would is extremely helpful to know what plant you are looking at, and “Picture this” does just that. | Use a different app.  They “say” you can reload if you change devices as long as still android or iPhone and that is a lie.   

The app wasn’t working so I did what I do with any other app.  Delete it and reinstall.    And guess what ?   Subscription GONE.  I didn’t have it on my iPad so I tried that.  Gone.  

Of course I kept seeing “hey resubscribe” which I did because I moved and there weren’t other apps of this kind then.   Complete rip off.  When it expires I will use a different one.   

And of course I couldn’t find any phone number to call.   Save your money - use a different app. | Says they don’t require any payment for free trial but as soon as free trial was accepted they took $5.41. If it’s free then it’s free it obviously isn’t. | I thought this sounded like a decent app. Then upon download it told me it would automatically charge me $30 without signing up for anything after 7 days through my iTunes account. I did NOT sign up for anything.

Most of the VPN cannot be used in China. This one is working. I strongly recommend this app to everyone who need it! | 链接快捷，非常好用，值得购买 | This is actually a really great vpn it works all the time and super fast | I’ve been using this for a while now. Google even believes I’m In the location specified | Great VPN | Free | Easy to download, launch, activate (free, ‘military-grade’), and integrate. Ascertaining the [free] VPN’s comprehensive effectiveness difficult. Being default alerted to attempted signal eavesdropping, etc., would be a helpful improvement. In the weeks since I have begun using this VPN app, I have noticed notable reduced fluidity and functionality of sending and receiving email (plain/rich text & attachments), and general web navigation productivity when using this [free, ‘military-grade’] VPN, both on home LAN WiFi and carrier LTE. 

Do I recommend this VPN app? Currently: 50/50; jury’s still out pending developer response + additional subsequent experience using this VPN app. | Really FREE, not like the rest.

Now there’s ads every five minutes. That’s ridiculous. I’ll go ahead and pay for express VPN instead. | I always use very often | Very great app. Better with premium | tuff | it works nice very fast once it connects | Special | Good | It really does work most of the time but it does work | Very good thanks for everything | Випиен реально супер вообще не лагает | 很棒很棒 | It works | By far the best free VPN, and possibly the only true “free” VPN. The rest are 1 week free trials, then they make you start paying for premium.
This one plays adverts in lieu of paying monthly fees, and it’s totally worth watching them for the kind of quality they offer.
There’s not many features for free, you can pretty much only connect to a foreign server, but for me that’s all I need, cause I just use it for region locked content. And there’s a large amount of servers in each region. There’s at least 5-10 servers for each country, and even more for ones like the USA and Canada. Only draw back is that the country selection is low.

But I’d say this is the only VPN I’ll need! It offers just enough countries, and all I need is to connect to different servers, and it does that pretty well. Definitely recommend. | Thank you",4.6006,1645,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3f/b8/93/3fb893a5-2d45-1486-9793-826e586c158a/a234bc1a-9c3e-424b-b804-b20d464bc5c9__U622a_U56fe1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/c6/e7/60/c6e7606a-8b93-5755-d90a-4d12ad4184e2/8be71f12-a975-4109-94ad-37a47843ac22__U622a_U56fe3_U00281_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/7b/89/f8/7b89f88a-4cd4-3ec8-3383-a4714c227c72/d41f0b5a-720c-4a09-8351-716328c298da__U622a_U56fe2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/1b/9e/17/1b9e17ad-eab6-ff9f-6d33-d8f119160cdf/mzl.etotbyal.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/2b/b5/99/2bb59955-83df-155f-4bbc-bcc7b876d861/65389f30-17c2-429e-9715-c96c6a9c5c96_ipad_U622a_U56fe_U00281_U0029.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/a8/1a/ec/a81aec29-0e52-c937-80c4-4dd8a4496b92/472fc005-9675-4f01-8fed-53a787f0f413_ipad_U622a_U56fe3_U00281_U0029.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/ab/20/00/ab2000a9-9c05-2087-c62c-91e3202a7e2c/490869a1-6308-47da-9055-f9f7b2a1af4d_ipad_U622a_U56fe2.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/6b/8b/7e/6b8b7e2a-9f60-9bc0-37e1-f2ee9a482fee/mzl.stxnqqke.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"
