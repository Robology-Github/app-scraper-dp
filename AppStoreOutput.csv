The app visualizes the visited countries both as a list, along with a ratio for each continent, and as a world map. The map can be shared on social networks, such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, using the standard iOS sharing functionality. You can compare your map with friends that also have the app, by sharing your map with them.

- If you miss the old look of the app, you can enable Classic Mode to get the old experience back. We hope you will like the new experience though, as we will continue to improve it.

PREMIUM MODE

There is a Premium Mode in the app that you can unlock, if you wish, by a single ONE-TIME In-App Purchase. It unlocks all features in the app.

Features unlocked with Premium Mode:

- In addition to states and regions in the US, with Premium, you can select regions in 25+ countries.
- Select cities and airports.
- More 3D globe filters.
- More visualizers, such as a chronologic map.
- Add local profiles, to allow for multiple maps and country selections.
- More detailed comparisons with more information.
- Share your timeline as a video.

For example ""Saturnia"" ""Punta Ala"" etc. What mapping api you are using?? | Great update but still a few things to improve. Organization of the app is confusing. I have hard time knowing where is what, it just doesn’t come naturally, actually the opposite. Marking countries (visited, lived, wished) is hard to find and complicated to do so. I love the chronology (isn’t it just better timeline?) but putting dates into countries is again complicated. I would like a map to see not just visited (+lived) countries but also wished ones. Watch out for making Been too complicated with the possibility to put every freaking detail. | Great app! I would just love to be able to break countries into smaller areas… e.g. in Spain that could be Balearic Islands and Canary Islands, Asturias, Galicia, Catalunya, Andalucia… i think it would give much more accurate representation of where we’ve actually been! And also give us satisfaction when we revisit the country but end up in a completely new place. | I love the app, is user friendly - very easy to use, but has a mistake - Scotland is not a country, is a part of United Kingdom. 

I am thinking to tick it off, so it counts into a percentage of land, but then it would give me total 71 countries visited, instead of 70. Any chance of upgrading this version?:) | I love the app, I would like to see a feature where you click on the map where you've been | Very nice app, but unfortunately I miss some states. If there are for example Gibraltar and Montserrat, there should be also US Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands, US Minor Outlying Islands, BIOT and so on :-). | Zjistil jsem, ze jsem navstivil 9% zemi na svete :) mam co dohanet :) | Primitivní ale úžasná appka. Nevíte někdo, jestli existuje něco podobného pro ČR ? | Hezká aplikace. Alespoň nezapomenu kde všude jsem byl. | Tak jsem zjistil že jsem prozkoumal 6% světa. Úžasná grafika. | My favourite app:) for all countries | Simple but smart. Skvely monitoring cestovani. | Je to bezva to takle vidět, ale není něco podobnýho i pro ČR? | Dobrá appka, ale USA by nemuselo byt zvlášť. Nevidíte tak celkovou mapu najednou. | Nice app!

Easily udnerstandable with reliable content. We have discovered many great places because of it!

What bothers me a lot are 2 things: bugs and some missing features

Bugs:
Tapping the “filtering” button in map is sometimes not working, idk why. Person has to tap it several times and even then it does not work. Once I managed to open the filters, it´s not possible to tap the “clear fitlers” button no matter what I do. Remaining buttons work as usual.

Missing features:
Why is it not possible to go to “map” to discover the places right away in the map. As we are planning our trips with different map apps (depending on the country, activity etc.) we like to search there. This way we have to go through the explore option->restaurants->filter (if needed)->map and then navigate. | I spent 7 days on this island with my family and we really appreciated the excellent room service provided by BASHIR, to whom I am very grateful.

So we had no trip and we still have not received the money back and have returned from holidays in the meantime (today it is 5 days from cancellation). So GetYourGuide has prevented us from taking the holiday trip and we still chase them to return our money. | Max spokojenost, snadné vyhledávání, platba, vše, co je na stránkách se potvrdilo. | My family had no chance to visit Keukenhof, tickets were sold out for that day. But your application helped me. Thank you! | We purchased tickets to London Shard 15 minutes in advance. After successful payment they told me that the issue of the ticket may take 2 hours. Tickets never came :-( | Then you’ll need to go on different websites to retrieve them. Support is poor. | Is this app free? | We bought a ticket on gyg and after 2 hour drive to the venue and four calls to the provider and 1 to gyg, we were informed that tickets were sold out and there's nothing to do but drive back 2 hours. | Me encanta la función de esta aplicación, es muy util para averiguar las actividades de cada ciudad que visito, muy recomendada, y una atención al cliente fenomenal | La plataforma no se hace responsable por el terrible servicio de los guías. Los dejan actuar a su consideración sin importar si ofrecen una buena experiencia o si cumplen con normas de higiene.

Además, hay constantes fallos a la hora de pagar los tours. | Farooq was an amazing driver, the whole experience was amazing would definitely do it again no doubt, looking forward to many more amazing experience | Perfect app :) must have! | Aplikace je skvělá pro každého kdo rád cestuje ať už po Evropě nebo dál.

Pak zjistíte, že vám nedošel notifikační email s potvrzením a číslem objednávky. na stránkách otázek a odpovědí dočtete že do 24 hod. nemáte panikařit protože to je běžné, že reakce dojde později.

Necháte si přeložit email pošlete ho na zákaznickou podporu, a žádná odpověď. počet letenek se tenčí a vy začnete propadat panice. Nakonec půjdete a koupíte si to u konkurence a vynadáte si že za to že jste si pořádně nepřečetl recenze.

But if you want to use their service, you better don’t 
They charge money for each small details. But if something goes wrong, they will just say that they can’t do anything. 
Examples:
1. Two way ticket. They cancel one part, and you have to have a premium to refund the second. Or buy 1 way for a full price
2. I didn’t show up to the flight. My return flight was canceled. My fault. Kiwi didn’t even inform me about that
…and I have more | Beware of extra payment at the airport. Kiwis are hiding the facts from you. Once I had to pay extra for check-in for 70 Euros. Today 50 Euros for a standard small piece of luggage, which is a matter of course when shopping outside of Kiwi. With a ticket through Kiwi, many things pay off in the chaos of the airport. There is nothing to deal with the company because they only have a Chatbot and it goes round and round in the same stages. Maybe and sometimes you can probably save a little, but at the expense of getting huge problems and no certainty about anything. | Kupovaly jsme s dcerou letenky s kiwi.com potřetí, před poslední cestou mě zmátly negativní komentáře, tak jsem trochu zpanikařila, ale vše proběhlo i napotřetí přesně podle plánu, a to včetně letenek s Ryanair… Za mě ok 👍 | App is ok, but the help, if you need one, is terrible. I had problems with Ryanair ID verification and Kiwi did not help me even a little. They simply are not responsible for anything, they do not know anything, and can noth help me with anything. If I want to make any change, first I should pay to Kiwi and that is important. Terrible experiance!!! | Cheaters, liaers and they are Staling money. Company like TV news. They ´ ve just bought stars. Business like this have to be closed. | Bought tickets for Ryanair. Had to pay for additional verification. Didn't work twice. Customer support offered no help nor refund even though I'm from EU. | Both apple pay or card, no additional information | I had to pay 30€ service fee for correcting one misspelled letter in my name. Something that would be free if I booked directly through the airline. I’ve since used this app just to look up the flights, will never book directly through kiwi again. | When you cannot log into the app in the day of the flight, it's not a big fun | Switch to CZK is rolled back to EUR by the app. 🫤 | I like the ux/ui, very intuitive. Good at finding flights. I hate how they try to upsell you so many times it gets annoying. Also when the flight gets cancelled they are not very helpful. Plus I would never book car or anything else then plane via them | I had a cancelled flight booking in April 2022. I had to wait over a year only to learn that “no compensation would be provided by the carrier”. The carrier was the Czech Airlines. The whole process was absolutely non-intransparent, I never received any official statement from the airline about the decision, even after requesting it. I honestly used to be a fan of this Czech startup couple of years ago, well not anymore. | Jste skvělí❤️ | Ужасное отношение к покупателям, никогда больше не буду пользоваться вашими услугами и никому не советую | Super👍👍👏 | The app won't launch on iOS 15.1.1. Please resolve the issue. | Perfektní vyhledávač, pro ty kteří nevědí  kdy a kam na poslední chvíli. Najde vhodne destinace a letenky za dobrou cenu. Vše vc.on-line odbavení bylo na 1*. Děkuji Marketa | I have bought plane tickets via web page, and after installed app. It took me 30 min to make visible my trip in app. It wasn’t cool. 

(Kiwi guys, you don’t have to be so much aggressive and pushy in marketing - I had already pursued trip and had already installed app - I just needed one to be seen in other one)

Two weeks after Kiwi wrote me that they failed to book my flights… 

Money have been returned in few days. But I have deleted the app and bought my flight via airline company directly - I cannot afford uncertainty and loosing more time. | Thanks to Kiwi we have awsome trip to Barcelona.On time updates and Boarding Pass and all service was 5 stars.
Definitely Recommended.
Thank You | Použili jsme jednou a už vždy budu používat pouze Kiwi.com. 
Aplikace připraví i letenky. 
Vše bez starosti. 👏👏👏👏 | Be careful if you buy flight ticket via Kiwi. There is many problems if there is change flight or transfer to another flight. Full refund even though you have insurance is big problem! | I love the option to look for flights from/to many countries at once.
I love how quickly and hassle free I can book the flight then. | After fulfilling all information, unable to proceed the payment w/ comment “please try it later”. Next day, same issue. At the end, flight tickets were proceed on main website of the flight company w/out any issues. | After booking a flight that I found unreasonable for me, I tried to change the flight and was willing to pay more. Unfortunately, the app wouldn't let me even do that. 

So I decided to cancel my flights with the airlines who agreed and refunded the money. Kiwi.com asks for proof of refund, I send it to them only for them to tell me they need to request for the refund themselves and I need to make a request. I make the request and they tell me I may (no guarantee) get a refund in 90 days.

Goodness. 90 days yet the airline told me this would take 5-7 days. No, I am not interested in Kiwi credit as I want to book my flight with my money directly with the airline. 

I don't recommend this app/company because cheap things are often more expensive. That expense may not be monetary as in this case.

Please just give me my money. | Such a good and optimized app. | Přes Kiwi.com je nákup letenek prostě pecka!!! | Do not buy tickets with kiwi and rather find other companies. 

Other companies have cheaper ticket, more options and when it comes to refunds or changes in flights they will not scam you like kiwi does.

Just check TrustPilot reviews and you will see. | Booked like 15 times and never had any bad experience. The app works really smooth and fast. Love the search options. | Kiwi does not consider adding a carry on as a basic service, so they charge you not only its price but also a fee of 30€. Hence my carry on would cost me more than the flight ticket itself.
I asked for complete refund for obvious reasons, and they rejected to refund more than 10€ it bc it is a Saver Fare ticket. 
I don’t cancel my flight because i want to, but because i need to carry my things too, no? And i won’t pay more for than 25€ for an small carry on jeez | Мошенники! Обманули на 350 евро! При отмене рейса (в независимости от времени) деньги не возвращают! Точнее, возвращают всего 10 евро! Не советую | AVOID USING THIS APP!! 
They have no control over airlines and no refund policy. 5-star for worst service!!
Worst airlines #aeroitalia.com and worst planner/scammer #kiwi.com

I have booked flight via Kiwi.com from Milan to Rome on 13.1.2023 flight no. XZ2122  and my PNR L7XKW9 which was scheduled first on 13.00 and then your airline rescheduled it to 11.00 and now today again you have rescheduled it to 06.30. Because of your airlines i can't board the flight XZ2122.

I am flying from Prague by Ryanair scheduled at 07.40 and will reach Milan at 9.00 on the 13.1.2023
Now tell me how am I supposed to board the Aeroitalia flight which you stupidly rescheduled at 06.30?

I have experienced the worst ever experience from the airlines and kiwi.com | Kiwi never more. I ordered some flights through kiwi. But two of them were canceled and more than half of the year had to wait. In the first case only credited, no money back. Second case still without success. I'm nearly sure that airlines already sent money to kiwi. Because I got directly from them compensation. But from kiwi no money for a tickets. It was bought for 11 persons!!! | It happened to me 3 times that i booked a flight and after few hours i get this message that carrier has increased the price and even though i paid the difference, again after few hours i got this message that  “we are sorry we couldn’t book your flight “
Don’t buy tickets from this app if you are in rush because otherwise your whole trip will be ruined thanks to their mismanagement ! | I was on their website with the flight in the basket but still wasn t convinced if I should buy or not, but a message popped out saying that: I will receive a discount of 25 euros if I book within 24h, which I did. I was waiting for the email with the promotional code on my mail. But it never came.
I contacted the customer support, and they were playing dump on me. | Kiwi agency in Brno is scam. No email, no customer line. I have booked my flight tickets via kiwi mobile app (booking number #253 471 724: flight from Prague on 8 August 2022 to Venice and back on 12 August ). Wizz Air cancelled my flight on the day of flight and i requested refund through kiwi application on the same day. The next day I received an email from kiwi stating that “carrier informed us they won't provide a refund for the return flight. I have contacted Wizz Air and contrary to your email, they told me kiwi didn’t contact them and verified by email that I’m eligible to receive full monetary refund for both flights (outbound and inbound). And moreover, i was able to make the verification of my flights and they already processed the refund of both my flights and sent it to Kiwi’s bank account (I believe you already received full money from Wizz Air). Bank transaction code of this transfer was also provided to me (can sent it to you if needed). I live in Czech Republic and I am eligible for full monetary refund of both flights. In case I don’t receive the full monetary refund, I am going to take this matter further and continue filling my complaint with all relevant EU and CZ regulators (Czech Republic Civil aviation authorities, Europe Direct Contact Centre according to EU air passengers right regulation act. I was not able to contact you neither via help desk, or bot to explain you my case. | I travel with Kiwi.com for more than 5 years and everything is ok if you don’t need any help. In that case you will not be able to get any feedback to your call’s massages etc… | When you try to open the Price table, kiwi app crashes, again and again :-( | Reálnou cenu letenky se dozvíte až těsně před platbou a tato cena je o cca 20-30% vyšší, než proklamovaná cena na srovnávačích. Nenese žádnou odpovědnost - v obchodních podmínkách je disclaimer na všechno. Zrušení letu nám oznámili 3 hodiny před odletem a to bez nároku na vrácení peněz, kompenzaci nebo cokoliv jiného. Dovolat se na helpdesk trvá hodiny a voláte někam do Indie. Nikdy více!!! | So when buying And choosing seat, there were around 20 free seats And after 5 hours of processing they told me that flight is sold out. Of course i did not paid any extra insurance so my 500GBP may take months to come back. NEVER EVER USING KIWI AGAIN !!!!!! Other companies take max 1 hour to confirm flight And do not lie to you . | Scam flight tickets terrible

Nikde jsem nenašla, kde najít ty normální cesty a ne tohle, aplikace pořád hrozně padá, když nahrávám třeba fotky z cesty. 
Nějak se to celé pokazilo koukám 😕 | Po určité době nejdou vkládat fotky. Hlásí to chybu 400. | Ráda si zde prohlížím své výlety | Aplikace naprosto dokonala, jen mi od 23.8 nejdou nahrat fotky. Do te doby vse v poradku. | Спасибо вам за это приложение, все собрано в одном месте, реальные люди и абсолютно разные поездки, все расписано с фотографиями - ну просто супер ! | Appka vypadá fajn, jen nevím, proč nemohu zobrazit polohu na mapě. Píše mi to jen, ze nemám oprávnění ale už ne jak jo získat. Taky jdou zadat jen celá čísla měn a když kliknu na naplánovaný bod v mapě, nezobrazí se mi podrobnosti… | Hrozna opravdu! Nefunguje ani obnova hesla, strasny format pro ios.
Nemluvim o tom ze nelze zakoupit. | Aplikace skvela, akorat pri prohlizeni prezentace ve fotkach spadne cela aplikace. | Pecková appka, využívám pro záznam cesty i pro plány. 
Jen když dám “uložit a odejít” tak mi to šíleně dlouho načítání a ukládá. Nejvíce, když plánuji nějakou delší trasu. Kolikrát se mi stalo že se mi plán ani neuložil.
Ale jinak. Doporučuji👏🏼 | Neaktualizuje se mi profil, hodně menších chyb na kterých by se mělo zapracovat , nepřehlednost | Vždycky když cestuji, naplánuji si cestu přes tuto aplikaci od A do Z. S worldee je cetování jednodušší💙. | Finally a great travel diary. | Worldee is such a cool concept and vision that helps everyone in the travel space. | After reading reviews for this app and actually going through functionality of the service, my conclusions is that the app is highly overrated and many reviews are far-fetched. To my view, functionality is typical/generic to many travel diary/planner applications available on the AppStore 🤷🏻‍♂️.

Trip/plan creation functionality is somehow counter-intuitive, it took me a while to get around it. Finally, I have discovered that there is a 10GB storage limitation to your uploaded content - be aware if you have a lot of good quality photos/videos to upload, you might end up paying 💵 Hmm.. just to note - other apps will handle the same functionality without any Subscription 💰😀

To summarize: the app will handle trip planning, but at the same time many other travel apps will do that task easily and without storage limitation (therefore 1 ⭐️). Overall design - good, but not enough to encourage me to use the app. | Its so nice and pretty application for my traveling. Its very intuitive for planning my trips and create my trips memories as well. I recommend this nice app for everyone who travel.😍😊 | I really appreciate the travel diary feauture, where I can save all my travel experiences and create my own travel app. In the same time I can find inspiration from other travellers, which is cool as well, because it saves me a lot of time | Spousta inspirace na cesty po česku i ve světě. | Do appky si můžu ukládat všechny fotky a rozdělit je podle místa a data. Skvělá je taky možnost podívat se na cesty ostatních uživatelů a inspirovat se jimi. | Aplikace se neda ovladat. Pri prvnim prihlaseni jsem vyplnila vsechny mnou navstivene zeme, nic se mi neulozilo a tedjiz  upravit nejde. Nejsou k disposici settings a muzu pouze pridavat celkove vylety. Fotografie mi taky nejde nahrat. Uz jsem zkousela i appku smazat a znovu nainstalovat a nepomohlo to. Odhlaseni taky neni mozne. Kde je problem?? | Worldee používám už nějakou dobu a jsem naprosto spokojený. Pomáhá mi rychleji naplánovat cesty a také prezentovat lépe zážitky z cest mé rodině/ kamarádům. Aplikace vypadá famózně! Potěšila mě. | Pre mna prilis zložité zadávanie minulých ciest, niekoľko krát appku vyplo, ďalej  napr pri písaní dátumu pri cestách mi nechce akceptovať formát, musím naklikat dátum z kalendára, ten sa neulozi a musím znova 🤦🏻‍♀️ chyba mi tam tlačidlo “naspäť” keď si pozerám niekoho profil, ale možno je to len o zvyku..  po prvých a rozhodujúcich 10 minútach chcem zmazať svoj účet ale nemám kde.. žiadne “profil menu/nastavenia” nenachádzam 🤷🏻‍♀️ | Super aplikace! Konečně mám svůj cestovatelský deník u sebe vždy když jsem na cestách. 😊 | Skvělá appka pro plánování cest a uložení vzpomínek z již uplynulých cest. Přehledná, jednoduchá appka a pro každého cestovatele. | Tak tahle appka mě vážně nadchla! Naprosto skvělá vychytávka pro každého, kdo rád cestuje. Hodí se pro celý proces cestování, jak před cestou, tak během ní i po ní. Worldee už znám a používám a s novou appkou mi vývojáři udělali obrovskou radost, skvěle se s ní pracuje! Díky a rozhodně appku doporučuji každému cestovateli! | Must have app for every traveller. An easy way to have all your memories in one place and backed up in the cloud.  Also great for inspiration and travel planning.  I really highly recommend! | Doporučuji. Je to skvělá aplikace pro každého cestovatele. | Amazing application, providing a lot of inspiration, the ability to share your photos and stories from trips, communicate with the community of amazing and experienced travelers, save all your memories in one place, where you will have everything beautifully organized.  Love it. This app is must-have before your next trip. | Worldee používám téměř od začátku. Je to super napstroj na cestování. Teď se podařilo vytvořit i mobilní appku a tak mužete mít naplánovaný itinerář pořád po ruce. Každý cestovatel to určitě ocení. | Webovou aplikaci Worldee používám už nějakou dobu a hned od počátku mě nadchla.
Mobilní appka posunula Worldee o velký kus dopředu a je super, že teď můžu mít plán cesty stále při ruce. Aplikace funguje svěle a je možné v ní využívat všechny funkce co má webová veze. Už se těším až ji vyzkouším přímo na cestách. Využívám appku už od beta verze a musím říct, že se velmi povedla!!!
Aplikaci doporučuji všem, kdo si chtějí jednoduše a přehledně organizovat plány svých cest a současně si budovat svůj cestovatelský deník s fotkami a popisky, tak aby se k nim mohli kdykoliv později vrátit.",4.67774,301,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/59/be/63/59be637a-cc76-dd7a-3c55-0924f6f1f633/75908df9-824c-4466-8346-782532b53209_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/80/ab/d4/80abd42a-2c41-2793-9894-6b03924c34d9/34238abe-f6a1-4df4-adb8-8dcca5b87ae4_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/34/ed/73/34ed73e2-d73b-7682-e608-a1ca66d1eedb/33d55340-53bc-423f-baa4-c8cfeb6c2f69_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/29/d9/5d/29d95da6-477a-9631-fa0a-ea1cdcc52e8b/53a96fc7-fa55-44bc-8a5a-ab98f6644adc_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/4a/74/9f/4a749f9f-dcf0-15ec-e915-e6789295f4a3/a07fd09e-1a6c-4468-95c2-cdaf24e4716f_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/3c/7b/51/3c7b51ea-8339-3af0-2a6d-a729ab0bff4f/81fbd7f1-8853-4d76-a3d4-e6355f4979a0_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/48/36/ea/4836eae6-31c7-c2c8-b14b-4f61908e3487/fa52d775-81d9-4c19-acf4-8834284c4bb2_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/fb/f2/8a/fbf28a68-a50e-dcab-0359-f9e5adc553d5/93311ee0-74d2-4ae8-b6fa-13b88a2c5ae0_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e0/81/7a/e0817a20-87df-5e03-c116-14a1f7c25786/e6c19663-0f5b-4165-9f6e-59191e77e08c_9.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

It is usefull as a hotel finder per filters, however the stays are more expensive than in the hotels directly (even with Genius membership). It is sad, it was great several years ago but now they dont know how high Booking’s margin should be. | Není třeba se moc rozepisovat prostě krátce vše bylo v nejlepším pořádku | Aplikace nemá možnost kontaktovat zákaznickou podporu - není uveden ani telefon, ani e-mail a ani formulář. | Thank you for such professional service | I recommend it. Great service. | Na vsetky svoje dovolenky pouzivam iba booking | Tato aplikace je přehledná, dá se vyhledávat i podle mapy. Služby jsou spolehlivé, vždy mám všechny informace, které potřebuji. | Hotel byl 3 stanice od Hbf nádraží, on stanice pak 5 minut pěšky. Na recepci milá obsluha. Nefungoval výtah tak nám vyměnili pokoj v nižším patře ( měli jsme velké kufry). Pokoj byl krásný a čistý. Matrace byli příjemně tvrdé. Zároveň stanice u hotelu byla na trase na letiště (30 minut cesta) - stejná stanice co jela z Hbf, i stejný směr. Navštívila bych znovu 😊 | Je to perfektní aplikace | Aplikaci Booking používán už léta ,a vždy velká spokojenost ,,dekuji,, | Ubytováni předčilo mé očekávání. Úžasné a útulné welness se saunou (parní a nomalní), jacuzzi, bázen. V hotelu jsme se cítili opravdu krásně. Snídaně byla výborná a bohatý výběr. Celý personál byl velmi vstřícný a milý! Poradil nám se vším co jsme potřebovali! 🙏🏽❤️ Opravdu doporučuji! Pokud hledáte klidný pobyt plný odpočinku a relaxu a milého personálu☺️ velký + je táke lokalita 📍 | Room in the hotel is clean and cozy. Receptionist Martina is very helpful she answered on our all questions immediately. Thank you! | Na cestování už jen Booking 🙏🏻 | Це найкращий додаток яким я користуюся, ціни помірні і качество супер, плюс бонуси різні | Mohu jen doporučit aplikaci používám již 10 let a zatím mne neklamala.
Za mne mohu jen doporučit 👍 | Hrube se chovaji ke klientovi, severou penize a ubytovani ani penize nemate. Tudiz nemuzete zaplatit ani jine ubytovani | Naprosto skvělé ubytování :) | Ubytování vždy najdu dle požadavků. Velká nabídka vyberu ubytování. | Používám soustavně. | I do not recommend booking’s taxi service, they will charge you even for cancelled services and their support is really poor. Such a disappointment, hotel reservations on booking are great. | Super | Spokojenost 👍 | Yes | Vždy perfektní ,veliká spokojenost .Doporučuji👍 | Funguje to | Good place near from lifts. New and clean. Equipment on the high level. | Booking je môj obľúbený a spoľahlivý pomocník na cestách. Skúšala som aj iné aplikácie, ale vždy sa nakoniec vrátim k bookingu pretože ponúka najviac nehnuteľností na prenájom, je možné cez neho zabookvať aj letenky a iné doplnkové služby, je user friendly a hlavne, je spoľahlivý, s ním nemám strach o svoje peniaze. | Canary comes collection apartment offered a pleasant three-night stay with picturesque views, well-equipped amenities, and friendly staff. It's a great choice for a short getaway in Tenerife. | Skvělé služby, maximální spokojenost! 👍👍👍 | Spokojenost, rychlá komunikace | Protože s manželem a dětmi hodně a rádi cestujeme, využíváme k tomu zejména tuto aplikaci. Je hezká, přehledná, efektivní a účelová. Vždy v ní najdu, co hledám a mnohem více. Líbí se mi také možnost získávání kreditů a -% slev. Právě jsem se dopracovala na Genius úroveň číslo 3 a to už jde sleva vidět. Aplikaci moc moc chválím. Tak ji hlavně nějak zásadně neměňte!:) Protože je skvělá a funguje :) Díky, hezký den | Ali and his family were very welcoming. Ali offered pick up at the airport and drop off at the port.,Very helpful.  I can only recommend | It amazes me how Booking can be leader in its field and have such a messy website and app. | Příjemný přístup,skvělá domluva dopředu na příjezdu,aby vše bylo k naší spokojenosti.Majitelka se po celou dobu starala,zda je vše ok a nic nám nechybí.Ubytování se nachází hned u vstupní brány do Sieny a má krásnou terasu s výhledem.Vřele doporučujeme ☺️ | In casa di Giuly siamo stati più che molto bene, apartamento era super pulitissimo, ci siamo sentiti come a casa. La Silvia è stata molto gentile. Sicuramente torniamo. | App continuously sticking in the chat, it's not possible to send images (e.g., ID), accomodation always want it, why it cannot be part of app?
It's not possible simply copy just part of message, e.g. email... 🤦‍♂️ | Musim rict ze skvělá komunikace napsal jsem zprávu a do dvaceti minut bylo vše vyřešeno zařízeno děkuji moc za skvělý pobyt | Chybí mi pouze kritéria jako např. “Možnost lyžování” a jiné vyžití. Jinak skvělá aplikace. | Spolehlivá apka, podle které cestuji již několik let. Vše vyřeším během pár minut přes mobil bez dalšího stresu, zda někde seženu ubytování či nikoliv. Vřele doporučuji👍 | Lepší aplikaci na zarezervování ubytování neznám. Když se s tím naučíte a využijete veškeré slevové kupóny a promo akce, dá se hodně ušetřit. 👆🏼♥️ | Ztrávily jsme víkend v Pytloun Wellness hotel Harrachov a bylo to nádherné krásný. Hotel je velký moderní, obsluha Tomáš a Daniel velmi příjemní a ochotni. Jídlo moc dobrý, porce jsou až moc velké. Určitě jsme ne byly tady na posled a příště jenom sem | Perfektní možnost výběru. Jednoduchost a rychlost vyřízení. | Týden jarních prázdnin jsme strávili v nádherném ubytování v centru Popradu. Paní hostitelka je velice příjemná, při příjezdu i během pobytu nás kontaktovala, zda něco nepotřebujeme. Ubytovani je krásné, čisté, moderní, skvele situované, k dispozici kvalitní káva i čaj. S malými dětmi oceníte také pracku a susicku. Velmi doporučuji, budete nadšeni a spokojeni stejne jako jsme byli my. 👍🏻 | Heski | Aplikace dává možnost porovnání ubytování v lokalitě, kterou si vyberete pro strávení dovolené, služební cesty či z jiných důvodů. Je zde perfektní přehled na mapách včetně uvedených cen. Dále jsou velice hodnotné recenze jednotlivých zákazníků v ubytovacích zařízení. Mohu jen doporučit. | Thank you Lahcen for your reception. It was very friendly and you help me with everything extra what I need. Very nice to meet you.

You can always see first member of family, but other boarding passes cant be seen in app. App doesnt rect to scroll to left/right to see other boarding passes. You have to go to web, log in and print. Not possible to download boarding passes in the app. | I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with my recent experience with Ryanair. My partner and I thought we found a great deal on flight tickets, but our excitement quickly turned into dismay upon arrival at the airport.

Unbeknownst to us, Ryanair has a policy requiring passengers to check in online. Failure to do so results in a hefty fee, which, in our case, was €110 for the two of us. This was not clearly communicated at any point during our booking process. There was no mention or warning of such a significant penalty for something as minor as not checking in online.

This lack of transparency feels like a deliberate trap for unsuspecting customers to extract more money. The fee we had to pay was more than 100% of our entire trip’s budget, completely throwing off our travel plans and finances.

The whole situation cast a dark shadow over our trip, turning what should have been a joyful getaway into a stressful financial burden. It’s disheartening to encounter such hidden traps and customer-unfriendly policies.

I urge Ryanair to reconsider their approach to communication and fees. Transparency and customer care should be paramount, not profit-making schemes that ruin trips and tarnish your company’s reputation.

Sincerely disappointed,
Andrey Kulchitskiy | Bad, the app app is not available in my country, so how do I check in by app? Ryanair should not save money on this and complicates our life | Its very cheap but they try to scam you in any possible way. They made the app and the website very hard to use so people make more  mistakes. | the company is the least customer centric service of all times. Either you print out (who want to do that hassle) or download an app. Otherwise, there is a fee for presenting the boarding pass on a phone. absolute rubbish | Musite si rezervovat sedacku a zaplatit, vlastne nemusite a na letisti zaplatite 55€, banda kretenu, nikdy vic.
Appka zahnojena reklamama. | Super app | It is problem od all low cost airlines but Ryanair is the ‘best’. 🙁 If anything is no in exact plan or application ot webportal there practicaly neexist posibilty for things changed or get to right. (There are not life people in Ryan…). It is very humiliating for customer.

Poměr cena a výkon je v pořádku! | I just cant understand why the app is not optimized for iphone 13. It is not on the whole screen, black lines in the top and bottom of screen like this app is from ios 8 and just not fit my screen (I have latest version) | Offer, offer and another offer on every step.

Are you sure you want a stressful, not smooth flight? No? Then buy all these extras and we will change your experience of the flight you bought with us from a misserable one to a fantastic one! 

Guys, upsell with reason. 

It would have been a good, functional, quality app it not turned into a spam maschine. | Totally useless applications. When I try to login it always says that user doesnt exist or wrong password. Even when I am logged on website under same account. Also tried to reset password and still same error msg. Please fix it | Everything used to work fine, but with the latest update I am unable to log in, it shows loading but it never actually loads and log me in. Not even via Apple id. Please fix the bug. iPhone 14 pro max | Logging in via email and password does not work. It is not possible to actually use the application. | app reguralry crashes when i try to book a return flight and is unfortunately unusable | Šupáci | There's no way to add the flights to my calendar. | …. constantly keeps logging me off, and login with facebook does not work at all now. | App now works terribly, constantly need to enter write login and password, the face-up does not work, app itself freezes and closes all the time. | They keep trying to scare you and on the top of it, they offer you options that are not applicable or do not work. Get some UX professional next time, please. | I had to pay for a seat (although wanted to be seated randomly) to be able to do the check-in! | Eveytime I want to see my trips I need to retrieve it via form with Reservation number and email. Why is that, this is ridiculous. iOS 16 | I definitely recommend to the ryanair team to improve the app! From my experience it’s vey frustrating full of errors. The older version gave an error do I installed the new one and unfortunately after all steps done, flight choosen, luggage, seats, all data entered including the bank card data and… nothing, the payment didn’t go through, no progress was saved. So i had to do all the same again. And again the app just dropped at the last step! I hope the bugs get fixed and progress gets saved if the app suddenly stops working! | All prices were in EUR, then I used my EUR account card. You made two currency exchange and stolen 12%. | Idiotska aplikace pro idiotskou aerolinku | A bit difficult pathway to checkout due to many times repeating xsell of insurance and bags and so on.

This will be my last flight with your company. | ... | Asking for app update and blocking the app right at the airport? That does not help at all! Please think before you do such things. | Whenever I just switch apps and then back again all my progress is lost! I lost a good taxi price because of this, and had to redo it 10x because I had to switch there and back between apps and Ryanair kept resetting itself. | I’ve tried to book a flight but unfortunately it shows me some sort of mistake while other person can easily book it at the same time | Při zakoupení více letenek na 1 e-mail adresu není možné v aplikaci přidat všechny letenky a udělat řádný on-line chceckin. 

Údajně je to chybou operátora (Pelikan), který zadává automaticky nefunkční e-mail adresy na další letenky. To se mi jeví jako lež, protože u jiných leteckých společnosti vše přes Pelikan funguje správně. 

Dělá to vše Ryanair proto, aby mohl schválně poplatkovat své klienty za neuskutečneny on-line check-in? Který ale není klientovou chybou, ale tím, že se není možné do systému přihlásit!!!

Velké zklamání směrem k Vaši společnosti. | This company is a rip off. Unfortunately… I was about to buy flight ticket and there was something wrong with the website and could not purchase it it was saying there is a mistake and the price is not avalaible it couldnt be sold out yet at the time - there were always same amount of seats so this website didnt not allow me to buy ticket and tricked me (by saying that the price is not avalaible) i was trying to buy ticket a whole day. After unsuccesful monday for 100€ (2tickets) i bought it on tuesday the price was 93x2 (186€ - 2tickets). Day after purchasiing i was looking for the price online now  it’s only 100€ for 2 tickets )back to the same first price which i was trying to get tickets on monday.. This is ridiculous…. I want my 86€ euros back | After downloading the application. Only Ryanair's page appears and I can't open it. I tried to install and uninstall. Restart the phone and the application still cannot be opened. :-( | Utterly useless as Ryanair is incredibly incompetent to inform its passengers (customers). | A tragicomic attempt at application. Trying to check-in I fill in the details, I want to verify them from the message. I return and the app cancels the check-in and returns to the home screen. Try maybe Easy Jet there the app is functional even on the latest iP13 pro. | Cheep flying, but aplication and prices for seats, drinks,…Never again | Impossibility to access through Facebook | Vydíráte a stresujete své zákazníky. Styďte se!!! | Jist | Jsem velmi spokojena jak s aplikaci tak se společnosti a jejími službami | Are tou trying to get your boarding pass? Well good luck.. App is full of ads, trying to sell tou anything during the check in process, but it fails to deliver one thing that is important - boarding pass. It happened to me multiple tines that I went through painfull process of check in, battling all annoying ads, just to learn in last step that it didn't went through and I need to start again from scratch. Painfull and frustrating | Ryanair provides a really bad service. Sales representatives in Madrid airport was very rude and unhelpful, will never flight again with Ryanair. | Dobrý den, bylo by super kdyby aplikace měla český jazyk | DanaPech | Becouse I am forced to download it, instead of just giving me mobile board pass via apple wallet.

HOW IT WORKS

Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 35,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration (MLAT), we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders.

Being a feeder, I have access to the Business plan, and there is zero complain feature-wise. Keep up the great work! ✈️ | This is best app | Dobrý 😍🥰 | Škoda, že není tato aplikace v českém jazyce, hned by byla zajímavější. Plánuje se toto zlepšení? | Ne | Perfektní appka😎 | Super aplikace,špičková,přehledná. | App neobsahuje češtinu porušení usnesení EU. | I paid for a year's SILVER subscription and still only BASIC works for me.  Fraud! | This app really contains all possible flight details, but it’s so complex and confusing. All I need from the app is somehow save/bookmark the flights that I want to follow so I can easily access them, but I didn’t find a way to do it. | The best app I’ve ever seen 👍 | Super app | AR still not fixed. Latest iOS, iPhone 13. Location is correct, but the direction is locked to north, does not move and shows no planes, even when in reality there are planes in that direction. | Super radar na letadla a doporučil bych ostatním lidem | Neodpovídá realitě opakovaně chyby ve sledování | Vaše aplikace je dobrá na sledování letadel když jste někde u letiště.a naopak chťelo by to pár úprav jako třeba že bude aplikace kompletně zadarmo protože lidi to přestanou stahovat😡😡 | I paid for subscription but get access only to free features. Restore purchase doesn’t work. Thiefs! | I love this app but I got a free trial for my silver subscription and when it billed I upgraded to gold. They promised that I would be refunded but I don’t see the refund anywhere and the transaction doesn’t show up on Apple support. They promised good support with gold but I don’t see a support option anywhere. | Too much advertising | 👍❤️ | Je to fakt super aplikace ale chtěl bych vidět i stíhačky.😎😎🤩 | Please stop this app for russia. | Chybí imatrikulace on line po zadání jen historie letu Ok stk | Hi | Zdraví Honza Havel! | Everything is clearly listed and easy to navigate. | It's a great app. One thing I don't understand is why it has to show fullscreen ads without any way of closing them? Is this a mean way to force people to tap on the ad? I have to restart the app in order to get rid of the fullscreen ad. | This app is very laggy and slow even on m1 ipad. It is almost not possible to use.. | After update no function. | Teď mě to úplně vyhodilo | Didn’t even got a refund! Thieves | Ta stará verze, co jsem si ji zaplatil a pak mi ji zrušili, ta byla perfektní. Tohleto je špatné. | It is a pitty; that there are not military planes... | Vynucen přechod z verze pro na předplatné, velice nefér. 👎 | No clear explanation why no refund provided for the discontinued pro version. I subscribed as they said it is lifetime.
Will not use it again. | Je to dobrý v tom ze když nad namá letí letadlo tak podle toho můžeme zjistit o jaké letadlo se jedna.  Takže vyborny❤️ | Bohužel poslední dobou špatně zobrazení dle velikosti letadla. I malé ultralighty zobrazuje stejnou ikonou jako Boeing 737. | Placená verze obsahuje reklamy!!! To mi nepřijde jako úplně férový postup!

Ikony letadel ani zdaleka neodpovídají tomu, jaké letadlo ukazuji. Vraťte prosím starou verzi!!! | Po aktualizaci jsou téměř veškerá data placená! Po zaplacení původní verze - nefér! | For those who purchased full previous app it should be for free (not only for 3 months) or with some proper discount!!! | I had regulary purchased app without adv. This swicht to new app licensed model in nothing else than pure robery. No interest of 3 months. And probably uninstall of the app. 
Monthly fees aren’t needed for my way of usage. Even I travel quite a lot. | Just making money, you pay for the app, they make “new” app and want money again.

Helped me in almost all of my journeys! | I was looking for a ticket with my girlfriend and you offer her 23€ and me 50€. Do you think I’m rich? If you want to you use a dynamic pricing algorithm at least you should get a new algo or fire your team cause I’m not rich yet. | 300 euros on here 130 pound in scotrail app | The worst. Pushes you into allowing notifications. Pop up for allowing notifications pops up all the time.
I DONT WANT YOUR STUPID NOTIFICATIONS!!!! | Proč? | So this app bought me tickets from Budapest to Prague. This is how the app created a path for me:

First I have to go on a bus that goes from Budapest to Prague then I have 9 minutes to get out of the bus to get to the train to Prague. 

I’m sitting in a bus right now that got into a traffic jam outside of Budapest for 1,5 hours and there is no way I can get in time to my train. I also can’t stay on a bus because tickets for this bus are sold out. So now I have to figure out how to buy tickets to Prague while I’m on the bus and also figure out how to return my money for the train that I will miss very soon.

Great Omio, well done. 

This app is a complete joke. Don’t install it just buy tickets directly from the company website | Tablet mi vždy stojí na stole. Potřebuji aplikaci na šířku, nechci používat tablet jako telefon. To je přece nesmysl. Zkusil jsem 3 lokality, nedošlo mi to spojení ani do jedné. | Tahle aplikace je jeden velký clickbait… vole nic mi to nenašlo, takže domů asi budu chodit pěšky, nebo fakt nevím. 
Zklamání. Doufám, že šlápnete holou nohou na lego. | The app is good but there are a lot of connections from various carriers missing | Love the interface, easy to use, fast, but theres a little hidden rip off and thats the service fee of 3.60€ on every trip in the checkout (to run the platform) that just seems too much to me, and you cannot know until you get to the final step. | This helped me find my way to many locations <333 | Funguje spolehlive. Skvělá je možnost okamžitého nákupu jízdenky na vlak. Rozhraní a design je krasne přehledný. A aplikace funguje rychle. Bohužel některé menší spoje neumí vyhledat. Napr busy mezi menšími městy v Itálii nebo letenky na ostrovy v Řecku. | Začala trucovat už při zadání cílové destinace. Stále nabízí jen cestu z A do A jinou možnost nedovolí. Snad pomůže návrat na web. | I have constant issues with retrieving the tickets for OBB, DBB and CD train lines.
The app does not support seat reservations for any carrier and since international trains are often overbooked, you might end up standing the whole way if you don’t purchase extra seat reservation directly with the train operator. | V pripade zadani lokalit (od-do) vam aplikace pomichane ukaze jiste ceny s casem rano pak vecer, to by az takovy problem nebyl jako to ze vam ukazuje ceny a nabizi jizdenku od 190,280 a jakmile zadare rezervovat tak vas to odkaze na web.stranky prepravce kde cena jizdenky je dvojnasobna | I booked a flight to cologne for today and they charge me twice .

From app I cannot book an tickets I have to do it from web page 

Can’t retrieve tickets 

Still waiting for my refound 269€ | Nic nenajde. Stále píše že datum je příliš blízko!!! 
Špatně!!!! | My story: I chose a flight for €40, then it said that the price had changed into €55, okey. A few moments later the price was back at €40, so I chose 2 persons and expected the price to be €80, and guess what it was €144... When I checked the price only for 1 person, it was €55 again, but it still doesn’t make €144 (2 x 55 = 110) and another €6 fee for pay 🙂 | Pouze se obavám, jestli to bude fungovat  i v Číně...? | Vyhledává pouze ""drahé"" letecké společnosti. Dá se sehnat stejný let za 1/3 inzerované nabídky. | Great! | Excelent App | Aplikace je k hovnu | Ráda a hodně cestuju a bez týhle aplikace už nedám ani ránu, nebo spíš ani jeden kilometr. Srovná mi cenu a délku cestování mezi různými městy, letovisky atd...všechno vidím na jednom místě a můžu se rozhodnout, jestli chci ušetřit čas nebo peníze. Občas mě překvapí, že nevím úplně všechno a na některých trasách se vyplatí vlak oproti letadlu, nebo bus místo vlaku ;) Taky se dá použít jako chytrej nástroj pro plánování dovolený po vlastní ose, kdo chce taky ještě dneska jezdit na dovolenou s cestovkou?!

-------

SEE IT ON A MAP

Every time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.

STORE PLANS OFFLINE

All your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.

GET ON THE ROAD

Looking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.

COLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS

For group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.

STAY ORGANIZED

Access flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.

GET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION

For each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.

CONTROL YOUR SPENDING

Set a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/d8/90/11/d890114a-47c8-b890-1fef-526a4816ad23/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","103196672","13.0","2019-08-22T07:00:00Z","2024-03-22T01:45:16Z","Wanderlog is more reliable: we fixed various small issues, and also launched the Dream Trip Contest for a chance to win a $1,000 trip to anywhere in the world!

I love the option to put in bunch of pdfs, but honestly for the tickets I will prefere the Apple Wallet at the airport.

It’s good for storing places to visit and helps you to have better idea about the trip.

What I’m missing
- Option to start a week on Monday
- Widgets of “what’s next” (TripIt has the upper hand)
- “just for me” option in the expenses
I realize that the expenses section is kind of app in the app, but since it’s there, let’s do it right. If you travel in group I would like to know how much has the trip cost me. If there are expenses shared just with some nebere of the party, i would like to have the option not to see that and have a very personalized chart of how much I ended up paying for the trip. 

(Would appreciate answer if any of that is something developers are planning to do) | I use it to plan my work trips as well as planning road trips with others. So far didn’t run into any issues, i love everything this app has to offer.
So far using the free version, might upgrade for my next trip. | I could not find how to set the night ferry as a hotel and change location from one harbour to another. Otherwise, it is a perfect app in Pro version. You can save all PDF travel documents and share all details about a trip with others.

Yet they charge it without a refund. Straight fraud! The app crashes, there aren’t many hosts in popular areas. You have to be very lucky to find someone. Inbox gets spammed by unrelated people. Not worth all the hassle. | The app is fine, I've even made friends on my trips thanks to it.
Unfortunately, I was careless and accidentally clicked the button to pay for lifetime subs when I registered. It cost me 60€, when I asked for a refund saying it was a mistake, they wrote that they can't give me a refund, be careful. | It added so much to my life. Highly recommend. Lots of interesting like minded people. Sometimes the app is buggy but nothing major. | It conected me to Belgrade guys when i was at košice lol fix. I went to center to meet them after that we realized that we are like 500km from each other. Apart from that always happy | Pandemic unfortunately changed a lot and also CS. It was great, now there is not many people, lot of inactive and it would need restart. But the worst is that guys use this excellent platform as dating app. Be aware, they put preferred gender “female” and have only female recommendations. Also dangerous for solo female travellers. Maybe CS could do something about it? I hope the good days are still ahead… | Couchsurfing was good app. Its still good way to meet new people but you have to be very careful of your money. There is something what they call VERIFICATION by you card. But in real they steal money from your account. I say steal, because there is no imformation about paymant, just “verification”. So its regular theft. Im so disapointed of evolution of this app. If you want money back, contact you bank. I was successful! ;) Dont waste time with contact CF support. They made bussines on this “verification”. | You destroyed the couchsurfing community with your greediness. I used to be a verified user, paid 50 euros and you still forced me to pay subscription. Now the app is so broken, I can’t even pay a subscription to check my old messages and friends. It’s a shame, you intentionally destroyed the community and are refusing to change your policy, trying to squeeze every last penny out of it. You don’t even need that much money to maintain this kind of app.. just trying to stuff your pockets with money. Now you lost most of the activity on the platform, it’s dead. | I am a member since 2015. 
I used it a lot and I use to love it! 
The original-real-CS-spirit, which excludes money 100%. It was build by volunteers and now it is just another company which is focusing mainly on profit, rather than on humanity, good, positive, helpful atmosphere. 

The sadest part of it is: the volunteers who build it up back then, are now mostly blocked and gone - since they weren’t allowed to say their opinions. 
Also lots of my CS-friends, with many reviews and experience have left.

Use to be an amazing place… | After downloading the app, I paid the monthly subscription as per their COVID 19 regulations. The subscription is confirmed by my bank as well as Apple Pay but I still cannot use the app norme access the website. Rather disappointed! | Begging for money for the membership is the worst thing you can do. Count me out. 
Member since 2012 | Even with the circumstances putting everything behind a paywall so that you
1. have to pay when you just want to host... but most importantly
2. can’t even contact your old friends,
is just pure impudence and chutzpah. | Would a 100% recommend using this platform while travelling | The poorest decisions from the company to block, persecute and damage the users that made it possible. I know ambassadors with hundreds of references and friend who got blocked because they dared to speak up against recent changes. I’l leaving....and feel so sorry it had to come to this :( | A must for travelling. Easy to use. 
I’ve been using Couchsurfing for a few years now and it’s great, I have no complaints. | Why app with automatic progress need a lot off money? 😀 | I’m only getting started with couchsurfing But i Love it already. Meeting locals is a lot of fun and saving up some money while traveling helps a lot :) | This application changed my life - met many friends, they treat me like a family. Only a few unpleasant situations - this is way of living, connecting with people and hanging out. Thanks for making this. | I think it would crash the internet of I will try to describe how I am thankfull for this app! I always travel like a local, safe some money, have so much fun and amazing experience! | After the new update notifications ( message alerts, requests) almost coming after 2 days later | After I login into the app and re-laughit app, app is frozen. I see the only splash screen.

PS: no, they’re not in my past tickets either | No live activity with gps-based arrival times | toto je nouzovka, spolecnost flixbus jsou smejdi | Nicht immer gibt es die gewünschten Zeiten. Ansonsten ist die App ganz ok | Pro nekoho asi super. Ja to neocenim. 
Chci si sednout na svoje misto a ne abych hledala kde mam sedet a kde je volno. | Decent buses, although necessity to pay for a seat reservation in a bus of this type seems weird to me. It takes more time to get on a bus and enforces people without a reservation to move around the bus on every stop.
Even worse situation comes when to polish wonen are occupying your seat unwilling to move for whatever reason. After asking the drivers to resolve that they answered in polish also (which I don’t understand) something like I shall find another seat. Well I paid to have my seat granted, so sorry, but this is unacceptable.
Good bye FlixBus, hope to never see you again. | Nelibi se mi, ze spolecnost v pripade potreby zruseni cesty ze strany klienta nevraci castku jizdneho. V pripade, ze autobusem cestujete vyjimecne, penize Vam propadnou!!! | I payed for seats reservation and for now reason Flixbus changed my seats for a lot worse option. Even since that seats what I reserved at first are free. Manager was good, but them also can't change it. The most interesting thing - if hadn't speak with manager - i wouldn't even receive refund for this huge inconvenience. In the end huge dissapointment. | Зарезервував білет за місяц заплатив за вибір місця при посадці на моєму місці була якась дінка, пішов до водія він каже напишіть рекламацію! Уйобок, зіпсував мені нерви ці телепні продають білети однакові номери місць кільком людям підряд. Я не рекомендую користуватися цим перевізником, інтернету немає водії невиховані бовдури! Забули людину на вокзалі я їм сказав за це що речі залишились а вони поїхали далі типу то його проблеми. Оберіть альтернативного перевізника. | Pluses: App is functional. Works quite well. 
Minuses: cannot export a ticket into my apple wallet :( | We took a flixbus from Prague to Rijeka and we want to complain about breaks. We had only a few breaks max. 15 minutes long, that would be alright if we stopped at least at one gas station. There was not any toilet. But when we took another flixbus back to Prague (from Rijeka) drivers stopped many times and mostly on gas stations. Breaks were much longer. We think it depends on the driver. But we think it is normal to stop at least once somewhere where we can buy something and use a toilet. Other things were alright.. | Schnel erledigt | škoda, že jste odstranili možnost přihlášení( | Dobry FlixBus | Hodnotím aplikaci, nikoli služby společnosti FlixBus. Aplikace pro nákup jízdenek, přes mezerou nemůžete jízdenky nakoupit, je k ničemu. Aplikace mi několikrát zamítla kartu i přes to, ze jsem na ní měl dostatek peněz. Následně jsem jízdenky nakoupil přes web bez problému. | Příliš komplikovaný vyhledávání. Jelikož je to minidopravce měl by nabízet místa stanic v seznamu. Zrovna tak jízdní řády . | There is no option to add a ticket to apple wallet, there is no registration and the app is quite slow and does not offer a black mode | I miss Apple wallet support, also adding event straight to calendar. | Buses are clean, spacious, mostly on time and with working Wi-Fi. I travel regularly. App is decent, but there are still things to improve. I personally missed these: - tickets in Apple Wallet/Watch (used to be there months ago) - purchasing multiple tickets at once - user account with possibility to charge credit in advance for future purchases - refunds directly to bank/user account - make app to remember me agreeing with FlixBus conditions and not to force me to scroll and click for every single ticket every time. - automatically cancel the ride and refund when removing the ticket in app. - automatically receiving calendar invitation for the ride I purchased - having some purchasing history report - being able to check current bus position | There is no student option on my app when choosing the passenger but my friend does have that option on his. How is this possible? | I just booked a trip with FlixBus and found out that it is no longer possible to add a ticket to Apple Wallet! Why, why, why?! This is a major nuisance! So much so that I will probably avoid using FlixBus altogether. Please fix! | You have written down that this app works with Apple Wallet, so I expected that I could add my ticket right to Apple Wallet, but I can’t find where or how to do that. I rather have all my cards and tickets in the Wallet, so I am quite disappointed with this. | Horrible experience. Absolute incompetence of customer service support chat. I have been waiting for the bus that never came for 3 hours, they couldn’t update the estimated time, couldn’t contact the driver to understand why the bus was standing hours at some gas station. No explanation at all. All agents at customer support chat were saying “we don’t know this info, if the bus doesn’t come in 30 minutes - contact us”. You contact them in 30 minutes and all they can say “Sorry, we don’t have this info, wait”. That’s it. 
It is unbelievable that I never got to my bus and never received an explanatory email/sms why this thing happened. Why would you even work and answer on this chat if you have no idea what is happening with your company bus. Jesus. | Trust me, i tried to depnde on them way too many times and they always let me down, bus was always 15-180 minutes late no joke, always so dirty inside, bus drivers couldnt speak Czech or English, people were siting on the floor many times becuse bus drivers solt them tickets to full bus i hope i will never have to use them ever again please | Ніколи в житті не буду користуватися! Недовіряйте їм! Їхав в один бік вони в останній момент відмінили рейс - але я таки добрався до Синая з Берно. На зворотньому шляху водій просто не зупинився і не взяв (на мапі слідкування пише що він виїзжає раніше чим написано в графіку хоча я чекав за 30хв до того). На сайті повернення грошей в ситуації коли водій не зупиняється нема. | It would be mor comfortable if the canceling a trip make a credit rather then sending a voucher. | For years there was a possibility to add tickets to Apple Wallet and now it's gone. Without it, it takes much more time to open the ticket on your phone. | Why is there no option to add my journeys to calendar or Apple Wallet? | App is ok but this company just takes your money and delivers mediocre service across the board from bad bus drivers to bad and useless customer support. Deleting flixbus from my life and requesting for my data to be deleted. | Was scheduled to travel home (mind u a 5 hour trip) sadly due to some bus delay and when my friend kindly asked the flixbus driver to wait just a minute he rudely told him that he doesn't care and then the bus drove away literally in front of my face. Not only did I lose my only means of going home for the entire week I also lost all the ticket money I spent. Horrible service never using again. Also will tell all my friends and fans using my prominent youtube and instagram account with a massive following. 1 star | šašci s nulovým zákaznickým servisem, ztracená zavazadla nejspíš rovnou vyhazujou do kontejneru nebo já fakt nevim:)) | Kvůli vašemu oznámení v aplikaci o zpoždění 1 hodiny a 16 minut jsme nenastoupili na bus. Při posledni kontrole (kontrolovali jsme několikrát) zda bude větší zpoždění jsme ale zjistili ze bus odjede včas, jenže jsme nestihli zastávku. V čas odjezdu jsme tedy jiz neměli ani 15 minut na změnu rezervace. Jak můžete mít zpoždění hodinu a 16 minut a toto zpoždění najednou nemít!! Kvůli vašemu špatnému oznámení jsme museli si koupit nove jízdenky za dalších cca 1900 Kč. Chci nahradit tento dodatečný nákup. Dolezalova rezervace 3030118547, | Viz vyse | No option to change seat on existing reservation. What amateur designed this app? 
...i bought an aisle seat and decided to change to a window seat instead. No option to change, so i canceled by seating option and got a refund of 2 eur. Tried to book the seats now as an ad-on but this option isn't available either!!
After some searching to find out if this was just some error, I just decided to cancel the whole trip and rebook with the seats I wanted.
Now we get to problem number 2: once you book you can only redeem one voucher, because they don't return your money to your card!!
So now I'm stuck with a useless voucher that I'm never gonna use because you can't even change seats on this useless app.
I wonder how many more issues this thing has.
Yeah, and the app is in 2 different languages for some weird reason, depending on what country you download it in. | Почему вы не пишете в приложении о том что возможны задержки на границе до 20 часов!!!!
Если бы в приложении было это предупреждение я бы никогда не купила этот билет. И не врите что вы не можете знать, у вас есть базы данных со временем прибытия автобусов по которым вы можете сделать предположение. 
Вы обманываете, когда пишите время прибытие и время в пути. и вы заранее об этом знаете. 
Я просто никогда больше не воспользуюсь фликсбасом. | Jízdenky sem si koupil s 2 týdenním předstihem, no už po 3. se mi stalo že mi je den před odjezdem stornovali, přitom autobus nebyl zrušen, ale vyprodán. Takže zrušili levnější jízdenky aby prodali dražší, den před odjezdem! 

Kontakt nenajdete, když ano, je linka placená, to je výsměch zákazníkům. Na email neodpovídají, dostat peníze zpátky je běh na dlouhou trať.

Pokud chcete dojet do cíle bez komplikací, využijte konkurenci. Flexibusem už nikdy víc ;) | I got two vouchers from cancelled rides. I’m not able to use both of them for single more expensive ticket. | Aplikace na nic. Asi tak jako celá společnost. 
Když chcete v aplikaci vystornovat jízdenku tak tam mate tu možnost, jen že ona Vám jen zmizí v aplikaci a potvrzení o stornu nedostanete ! Vlastně Vám nikdo ani nevrátí peníze. Podpora Vám s tím taky nepomůže tam umí posílat jen automatickou odpověď. 
  Na nic aplikace, úplné zklamání… | Neumožňuje předvolbu o 3 cifrách👎👎 | Moc fajn se s Vámi cestuje | Can’t see stops, settings, terms: it all sends me to some web with a long string of a message starting “access denied”. The app overall is barely usable. | Dobrý večer, aplikace mi hlásí, že mám jízdenku potvrzenou, peníze z účtu mi to taky odečetlo, ale jízdenka není nikde k nalezení. | Bohužel jedna z posledních verzí aplikaci úplně rozbila. Při spuštění vyskočí upozornění, že se nelze připojit k serveru; to znamená, že aplikace je naprosto nepoužitelná.

The developers of this app dont do anything to help other than monetize this app to the maximum. For some reason they added a completely greedy feed that make every ride much more expensive. And they didnt even fix all the problems like having no notifications. Theres nothing we can do. | Sorry, but to ask 5€ for a shared ride is stealing from app's perspective. Also conversion rate czk/eur is horrible so my ""customers"" have even higher price shown. Therefore it's not very cheap as sharing a ride should be until certain point. | Prosím vás vyřešte si ty přetrvávající problémy s nekompatibilními smskami k dávno schváleným cestujícím.

Aplikace nastavuje region podle jazyku na iPhone, ne podle poloze/ IP/ tel číslu/vlastní volbě. Zaregistroval jsem účet na jiném regoinu a neumožnilo mi hledát jízdu v Evropě, abych to mohl změnit musel nastavit Češtinu jako hlavní jazyk a nainstalovat BlaBlaCar znovu, potom vznikl nový problém, minulý účet je na jiném regionu a nemůžu vystoupit z něho do aplikace, protože nepřístupný v Českém regionu a zrovna nemůžu použít už svoje telefonní číslo na novém účtu, protože je už nastaveno jinde. Největší sranda kterou jsem viděl v svém životě | Останнім часом пасажири дуже знахабніли. Вони хочуть щоб їх забирали за 10 - 15 а той навіть 20 кілометрів від маршруту. Коли я їм відмовляю та пропоную під’їхати ближче - негативно реагують, вважають що я роблю щось погане та в результаті скасовують поїздку і пишуть погані відгуки. Тому я дуже вас прошу, зробіть так щоб можна було уточнити місцезнаходження пасажира, якщо він надто далеко і хоче щоб його звідти забрали то змінюйте або вартість поїздки або ж робіть так щоб пасажир сам дістався як найближче до водія. Тому що їхати за ним і витрачати купу  свого часу, палива, та нервів на це все, не дуже хочеться за ті гроші які ви пропонуєте. Дякую! | They announced fees which is insanely high! Never again - all people I know are now using the app only to agree on ride - than cancel and spare fee. For 50€ ride they want almost additional 20€ fee | Proc kdyz jsem zaplatila rezervačný poplatok 10.12.2023 a ešte jsem si nerezervovala zadnú jizdu mám znovu platiť další ??? Prosím o vraceni rezervačného poplatku z 10.12.2023! Dekuji | Aplikace je opravdu vynikající, jen nevím proč chybí například Renault Trafic, Fiat Ducato, počítám že i Peugeot Boxer s další dodávky. Sám mám Trafica a moc se mi nelíbí že musím mít zadané vozidlo Kangoo maxi. 
Udělejte s tím něco. 😁
Díky! | Šílené poplatky a vývojář aplikace by zasloužil přes prsty | Nejde posílat telefonní čísla, tudíž se spolujizdy nedají domluvit !!!! Aplikace v tom případě nevyuzitelna. | Dobrý, fajn lidi | Už jsem pár let nejel a od té doby spolujizdu zpoplatnili, že se nestačím divit. Chápu, že vývoj a údržba něco stojí, ale na cestě HK - Praha jde 95 Kč řidiči a 35 Kč je poplatek, to mi přijde hodně přestřelené. | Od doby co zavedli velké poplatky mi přijde, že to nikdo nepoužívá. Ani se nedivím, žumpa. | It shows me zero drives while other people can see some with the same setting | Постоянно пишет места только на территории РФ. Я живу в Европе. При поиске «Прага» - выдает кафе в Москве, но не как не столицу ЧР.  Отвратительное приложение | Nice | This is garbage. The app asks for your location (makes sense) and then sets the app langue’s to the country your in. With no option to change it. This is unacceptable. 
Blablacar the website is still a great service to society | Pořád hlásí problém se sítí. Vypnout Wi-Fi a použít data nepomohlo. | Už několik měsíců čekám na odpověď, ženy kontakt opakoval jsem několikrát dotaz. Servisní poplatek z nic protože se s nikým nespojite. | Very nice app, but ut would work even better when there would be a chance to see all possible rides from one specific place. When I want to travel randomly from my location I would appreciate this a lot.
Thanks | Language problem | Chybi FORD TOURNEO CUSTOM, jinak vse super. | Apple privacy login is not working, registered with Apple “Hide-my-email” feature, one day it just stopped working. Contacted Apple Support they said that your, BlaBlaCar’s privacy relay, is not properly configured.

I am blocked out of my account for already 2 weeks, and submitted ticket through your website and still didn’t get any response at all | On one side good app. But they afraid lost money they check text between me and passengers. Not so easy to make any deal bcs they directly block it! But I am not negotiate about price!! I am still nervous when I use this bull sh.... App. And they want money for that🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ | I put notifications on the rides and dates and they co e to my e-mail but then when I want to reserve it, not possible. Also when I search nothing is showing but I have lot of them in e-mail. | I’m am not able to change language of the app at all | Nebezpecny clovek v aplikaci Rastislav bez blokace od firmy Blablacar. Firma jo neblokuje, naopak lzive me obvinuje | In Czechia dramaticly decreased using app after implementing fees- seach for new free alternative recommender by czech drivers and sharemates. This is the end by Adele, salut francoise marqueting | Love this app🤩🤩 | How can it be that in the app there are no cars available literally anywhere, but when I go to the website there are around 10 different drivers?? Yet even the website is so slow that we missed every possible connection on our journey
Thanks a lot, BlaBlaCar, you are just hideous! | Mohu jen doporučit! Super appka pro spolujizdu. Rychlá komunikace s ostatními přes chat a rychlé nalezení spolujezdců.
Z 20ti jízd jsem jel sam jenom 1x. | This app is totally wrong. When you try register, there is a field for email. Whatever email you will use, nothing happen. Just a warming that system can not use this kind of email. After 30 minutes trying to vo nect via email, apple or fcb it is waste of time. Good luck. | I am really grateful for this application, thanks a lot. | The update of the app brought one negative feature: used to be possible to add precise address, not anymore. All you can enter is the town/city and you need to find a place on the map, since the app does not let you proceed without putting the exact place in. Takes much more time since you need to orientate in the city map to tick a place | Like the idea, but…
You can’t write numbers in the chat-that’s iritating
You can’t send photos or share location
You have to manually check if you got any new messages. 
Every time when using the app it is a struggle. | Nelíbí se mi, že poslední dobou se dozvídám od cestujících, že musí platit nějaké peníze, když si chtějí rezervovat jízdu. Myslím, že to potom tahle aplikace ztrácí smysl a přiživuje se na tom někdo třetí. Pokud potřebuji z bodu A do bodu B, tak zaplatím řidiči, ale proč se přiživuje na moji ochotě někoho svést, někdo pod záminkou, že musí udržovat aplikaci? Spousta aplikaci je zdarma a nebo to má postavit na dobrovolném přízpěvku. | Приложение ужасное, просто херня. Идея очень классная, но само приложение ужас. Столько недочетов. Не могу поменять пароль в который раз, не могу зарегистрироваться через фэйсбук или почту. Почему нельзя зарегистрироваться по номеру телефона ? Почему я не могу звонить водителям ? Или скинуть им свой номер. Бред просто | appka bola skvelá, ale učtovanie rezervačných poplatkov ??? really? nechapem prečo, asi profit ale ok, lenže support som nedostal ked som potreboval. Najnovšie mi napr. appka posiela žiadosti od pasažierov aj ked jazdu mam už plnú. sorry guys asi. | Od chvíle, co zpoplatnili jízdy a to poměrně značně, se jízdy vůbec nevyplatí. | Chat v aplikaci funguje velmi sporadicky. 
Navíc zavedením dost vysokých poplatků za každou jízdu, které se navíc odvíjí od vzdálenosti, už to přestává dávat smysl. Chápu, že se to musí monetizovat, ale tohle není zrovna dobrý způsob. 
Když mi byla rezervace zrušena automaticky Blablacar, očekávala bych, že mi poplatek hned vrátí, ale to se neděje. Nikde není tlačítko reklamovat platbu nebo nějaký rychlý kontakt, jak to vyřešit. 
Mnoho jízd v aplikaci jsou autobusové a jiné linky dopravců.... 
Zároveň bych ocenila, aby na první pohled v v přehledu jízd bylo vidět, jaké národnosti je řidič, abych to nemusela složitě hledat v profilu. | Unfortunately unable to search ""from"" and ""where"". You can see spinning circle and after some time notification ""unable to finish  this action"". The same with signing in,unable to sing in with email,nor with fb account nor with any other method. Reinstalling and switching from cellular to Wi-Fi didn't help. The app is useless at my iPhone. | Bohužel musím konstatovat, že od konce prosince 2022, kdy aplikace zavedla “servisní” poplatek 50 Kč mi to přestává dávat smysl. Asi bych pochopila poplatek 5-10% z jízdy.

- We also have a ""Price Schedule"" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.
- And the ""Price Map"" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.
- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.
- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.
- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).
- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.
- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.

By the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:

- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.
- Guided and self-guided tours.
- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go

When flying somewhere always found best offer and price vis skyscanner | Prices on flights and availability of flights and baggage is misleading | Super vyhledávač všem doporučuji | Skvela appka na sledovani vyvoje cen a vyhledavani leteckeho spojeni I hotelu. | Vše je přehledné a jasné , děkuji 👍 | Dobrý den vadí mě že nabízíte mají mytrip agenturu která je neseriózní a s své klienty klame při reklamaci
A dále má falešné recenze tady v Evropě. | انه الأفضل على الاطلاق، ذهبت لوجهات سياحية جديدة لم اكن اعرف عنها شيء، شكرا لكم | An app which has been discriminating from a day one. What country of one’s origin (possibly stuck in settings since years) has to have to do with showing the search results? | Skyscanner is promoting services of Mytrip/ Gotogate, which is totally a fraudulent company that keeps refunds for canceled flights and does not provide the services they sold | Can't easily only choose direct flights. Hard to see flight availability for other days without clicking on each day. | So probably after the update, it's impossible to search on Pro Max 13. The buttons don't do anything, tapping Flights goes nowhere. Restarting does not help.  Sad. Will update my rating if it starts working again. | I love this website and app, theres two negatives on the app version (apple) you can not select the whole to see prices and you can not select direct flight option like you can on the web version. Please add these features in! | I’m using this app already almost 8 years. If I need a ticket I’m going here first ! Really recommend | Guys, your app is amazing BUT my currency and country paraments reset EVERY TIME the app shows me the notification about private data collection. My phone is in Russian language but the country is Czech Republic and the currency is CZK. I had 3 notifications today and had to reset currency/country for three times a day back from automatic Russia/Ruble! Please please please fix it🙏🏻 I love the app and want to use it without bugs. | The app is terrible. Once you put the dates of travel it remembers it and don’t let you to use “find the cheapest day”. So you close the app then open and what? STILL THE SAME. This lag was always here and it looks like they don’t intend to change it NEVER | I just love this app so freakin much! It’s very simple and easy to use. I found so many flights I wasn’t been able to find anywhere else. And for a really good price! I fully recommend this app to all passionate travelers all around the world! ✨ | Opravdu tohle byvala nejlepší aplikace, ale dnes z ni zbylo pramálo 🙏 špatná orientace, chybí graf letů, takle je to pokus omyl, nebaví me to, prechazim na jinou aplikaci 🤢🤢 | It’s misleading and information. when you search in the system using simplified chinese, the information is WRONG. one star for this. Correct it or I won’t used it. | SUPER, líbí se mi, s úrovní jsem spokojen! | Moc pomalé a spousta chyb. | Firstly I select 2 cities. Thats ok. But when I want to select date, the app suddenly crashes. Because of that, the app is useless... please fix ASAP!!! | Proc nezustane to co je vyhledano delsi dobu aktivni a i po uzamceni obrazovky se pak nezobrazi. | Jsem nadšený uživatel aplikace #skyscaner | Thank you for the app! Best for travel best for booking! | Tahle aktualizace se moc nepovedla . Hledání letů je strašně nepřehledné a složité. Při zadání vyhledávání na celý měsíc se nezobrazuje jaká letecká společnost let provozuje. Chybí graf, který byl super. Teď jsem v aplikaci chvilku bloudil a pak jsem to radši vypnul.... | Your new app update doesnt work at all. It cant find any single ticket to any destination. | nefunguje volba “kamkoliv” jako na webu | Application crashes constantly: either it freezes and forgets my searches (Sisyphus I am) or terminates (RIP poor app [*]). User (me) is sad and hopelessly dreams about holidays that apparently will never happen. Sob. | I found tickets through Skyscanner, I was redirected to mytrip.com where I bought those tickets. In a few hours I’ve received an email with cancellation, however there is no way to get my money back (400$).  Mytrip.com doesn’t reply on email , they don’t pick a call via phone provided on their web site. | Родителям через месяц нужно купить билеты, и онибоятся посмотреть даты и стоимость, так как знают что во второй раз стоимость будет выше. И еще стараются это делать не с айфона а со старого виндовс ПК. В итоге смотреть приходится мне, чтоб потом они купили по самому выгодному варианту. А так приложение работает отлично. | VYBORNA APLIKACE RIHLA A PREHLADNA | Dík | Stary skyscanner byl mnohem vice userfriendly. Graf letenek byl prehledny a clovek vedel, co kdy stoji. 
Pro me ohromny krok zpet | Good overview of options. Often freezes. | The Classic app was better. This one is missing crucial features for searching cheapest tickets... Deleted. | Always the best... | Kolabují vám weby 🙂 | The best app for travel. | Aplikaci jsem si stahnul diky nabidce na webove strance. Jenze to jsem nevedel, ze obsah neni stejny..... Marne totiz v aplikaci hledam nahled na aktualni prilety a odlety - stejne jako na webu. Bez toho je pro mne apka nepouzitelna..... | Parametry hledani nevyhovujici, nejde nastavit delka pobytu, nejdou nastavit pozadovana letiste. Proste pokud chci vyhledat lety z konkretnich letist do konkretnich zemi s mnou pozadovanou delkou pobytu, tak mam smulu, pritom, kdo by letel do Mexika na 4 noci nebo vikend? Mozna dobre na poskakovani po evrope, ale seriozni cestovani ne. | Je to super vyhledávací program, ale ceny nejsou nejak závratné | V minulosti byl skvělý graf letů jako hlavní nástroj vyhledávání. Škoda, že je teď schován v okně zadávání dne letu jako vedlejší způsob zadávání a s potlačeným zobrazením této volby. Našel jsem ho až na základě upozornění vývojáře.
Tak prosím, do příště opravit = lépe nabídnout tuto skvělou funkci :-) | Skyscanner je nejlepší nástroj, který je na trhu. Narozdíl od ostatních opravdu nachází nejnižší ceny a nabízí k tomu pokročilé možnosti. Takže pokud nevíte kam jet, nesejde vám na přesném termínu,nebo vám nevadí přestupy mezi letišti tak mohu tuto aplikaci jen doporučit. | Skvela aplikace, dobre vyladena, rychla, snadna, designove

Jediné velké minus, tak kolečko na nastavování času. Kdy omylem přejedu prstem při nastavování do středu a aktivují parkování se špatným časem. A k tomu ještě zjistím ze mám nataveno jiné auto. 
Takže musím zaplatit znovu. A vlastně parkování vyjde mnohem dráž než u automatu a nebo se starou aplikaci MPLa která fungovala perfektně. | Za každé parkování berou servisní poplatek. Jsou aplikace kde to jde bez poplatků, takže radši budu používat jiné. | Za každé parkování platíte servisní poplatek, dejte si pozor. Citymove a ostatní aplikace jsou zcela zdarma! | Aplikace už funguje bez problému. | Is this a joke? how come you lot taking a 7kr commission for a 20kr parking? incredible | Now they added a service fee that's up to 20% of the parking price. Insane. And no other good options. Classic business model. Offer great service. Screw customers once addicted. | Moc nerozumim existenci těhle dalších aplikací | Za mě není této aplikaci to vytknout splňuje všechny moje požadavky na jednoduché zaplacení za parkování ve městě. | Udělali ze staré funkční aplikace novou a v Brně nefunkční. Bravo, tleskám! | Od března 2024 si aplikace účtuje navíc 15% za parkovací poplatek! A to není málo. Jsou aplikace, kde nic neplatite. Pro mě zklamání jinak výborné aplikace, ale platit 15% !!! navíc mi přijde mimo. | The blue zones are bigger in the app than in reality... They charge on free area. Checked in  Valencia. Scammers... | Zlatá předchozí MPLA aplikace. Neuctovala servisní poplatek. Ale co je o dost horší, ze když potřebujete zaplatit na zóně nebo zónách více vozidel najednou, tak to nelze! Předchozí app bez problému. | A service fee of 15% for being able to pay to the public service(city)? 100 czk/month to get an invoice? This is ransom. | I used this app twice and I wont use it ever again. They charge you money and you wont even know that yoo actually gave the agreement to it. I accodentaly bought a praking time just by touching the wheel in app. The worst parking app I’ve ever seen tbh. | Aplikace dobrá, ale drahé poplatky. V dnešní době nesmyslně vysoké! Jsou podobné aplikace bez poplatků. | They just charge you 15% for their services on top what you’re paying for parking. 15% for facilitating a parking booking is insane. Use mpla.io instead and save yourselves a lot of money. | Dnes mi aplikace oznámila že začnou účtovat servisní poplatek 15%. To vnímám jako naprostou nehoráznost. Nic není zadarmo, ale z mého pohledu 3% maximálně je adekvátní, jako u různých jiných služeb kde si zprostředkovatele služeb účtují například jedno až 3%. 15% naprosto žádném případě. 
Argument že díky tomuto poplatku mohou vůbec fungovat a přinášet nám úsporu času, vnímám jako alibismus. To by mohli říct i U 90 procentní ho poplatku. Měli by mít nastaven poplatek takový že se určitě nejedná o 15% ceny. To je prostě mimo mísu. Aplikaci tady mažu a snad někdy dojde ke změně. | During acquisition of MPLA app I was been forced to start using this app, and I’m not satisfied at all.

1. Paying 15% fee of each parking especially in places where the price is 80 CZK/ hour I consider as too much.
2. Spinning wheel for setup ending time is not comfortable. Have a calendar picker with roller like alarm in iOS will be much better.

Please consider changing pricing model, because receiving fees from city for using your service and also from customers is very unfair. | Pokud budete nastavovat parkovací dobu a omylem se u kliknete do středu růžového kolečka aplikace vám okamžitě strhne peníze bez ohledu na to zda s tím souhlasíte nebo nesouhlasíte. A i když na místě vůbec ne parkujete. Žádná možnost zrušení či odvolání. | Šílenost , draha , platba za předčasně ukončení parkování je lež , zlata MPLA | EasyPark je super, ale v praze si uctuji prilis vysokou provizi a pritom stejnou sluzbu plni PID Litacka, ktera si neuctuje zadny poplatek. | Je to spolehlivá aplikace | Zlatá jednoduchá aplikace MPLA. Škoda, tímto končím s online parkováním 😞 | I does not find nearby parking zones | The spinning wheel is a terrible interface for choosing the time.

And even if I selected e.g. 30min parking for 20CZK and confirmed that, the app charged me 50CZK for 1h parking. How is that possible??? | Aplikace je skvělá. Zaplatím jen tolik, kolik reálně využiju. | Musel jsem přejít z MPLA, kterou jsem léta používal a byl s ní nad míru spokojen. Tohle je ale skutečná katastrofa, která si nezaslouží ani tu jednu hvězdičku.

Co se mi nelíbí:
- design je příšerný
- EasyPark se chlubí větším pokrytím, proč tedy nemohu najít parkovací zóny v Kosmonosech a Mladé Boleslavi, když s MPLA tu platit šlo?
- servisní poplatek 15 %!?
- lze nainstalovat pouze na iOS 16, takže pro mě použitelné pouze na iPadu (který ne vždy vozím). Na mém iPhonu s 15.8 už nepoužitelné.

Co se mi líbí:
- na nic jsem nepřišel.

Nastal čas přejít ke konkurenční aplikaci, kterou už mám delší dobu staženou, ale díky MPLA jsem neměl potřebu ji důkladněji vyzkoušet. Teď ten čas nadešel. Sbohem! | Jako účtovat si servisní poplatky za to, že někomu platíte mi přijde už opravdu přes čáru.
Prostředí aplikace je hrozné, kombinace růžůvé a fialové je k blinkání. Nastavování hodin je náročné a celkově nechápu, že to apple pustil. | The app has several big flaws:

1) It does not show parking lot available in the location in map, based on your location. It's possible to find it using street search though. 

2) the parking zone mentioned in the app does not match the one shown on parking sign 

3) server not responding, unable to pay for parking 

4) when it works, the reservation is made for 1 minute only (ignoring the period requested) | Aplikaci jsem pouzival, ale koncim s ni po zavedeni 15% poplatku za parkovaci sluzby v Praze. Tady se nekdo uplne zblaznil...! Good luck... | Update: Aplikace byla naprosto čerstvá. Musel jsem ji nainstalovat hned poté, co mi MPLA oznámilo, že už si nezaparkuju. Asi jste holt předběhli sami sebe. Teď už je to stejně fuk. Nakonec jsem radši zaplatil v automatu kartou 😏

Jak zadat požadované 4 cifry, když v SMS přijde 6místný kód? A ne, nechtějte, abych kontaktoval podporu - předejte si to sami. Už jen to, že zapnu MPLA, chci zadat parkování a bez jakéhokoli upozornění s rozumným předstihem se objeví jen strohá hláška, že už nemůžu. WTF? | For my perspective, you are providing a service more benefiting the city than the parking person. I will find an app that I don’t pay a service fee for. The parking fees are high enough | Jsem zklamán. Předchozí app byla bez správních poplatků. Což o to to by mi nevadilo kdyby se poplatek nezvyšoval na základě délky parkování.. čím déle parkuji tim je poplatek vyšší což nechápu a je to pro mě signál že něco není ok a že na mě chce nekdo vydělat, asi se jdu podívat se po jiné app. | Při spuštění aplikace to chce telefonní cislo na které prijde sms s 6 čísly ale aplikace chce jen 4 to nechápu . | I got transferred from MPLA and so far I really liked the app and the option to pay precisely for the time being parked, so much that I even ignored the personal data leak incident. 
However, I just received an email from EasyPark that they will start charging an additional fee on top of the parking price. This means that I should pay... to pay. Well, it's not happening. Worst business decision. Bye. | Aplikace není schopná odečíst si peníze za parkovné předem! Zaparkuji, nastavím v aplikaci čas, zaplatím a odejdu z auta. Druhý den ráno mi píšou, že nemám zaplaceno, že mám zablokovaný účet. Oni si ty peníze z účtu snažili vzít až po skoro 24 hodinách od parkování. V tu chvíli jsem si říkala, zda jsem opravdu měla pokryté parkovné v době, co jsem parkovala. Podpora absolutně nereagovala, původně jsem totiž vůbec nechápala, za co dlužím. Nakonec mi přijde email, že mi začnou účtovat poplatek k parkovnému? Účet i aplikaci jsem smazala, raději dojdu k automatu nebo použiji něco jiného. | The last time I had paid parking in the app was a year ago. Last night the EasyPark app stole money from my account even though I didn't park anywhere and didn't use the app. What he is trying is beyond human behavior. They are thieves! | Aplikace je tak intuitivní, ze jsem za hodinu parkovani zaplatila trojnásobek 👌🏻 zlata MPLA se mi nikdy nestalo, abych měla jakýkoliv problém s aplikaci a placením parkovani… | Tedy aspon v Liberci | nemuzu z jendoho mobilu zaroven obslouzit dve ruzna auta | Nejen, že se platí poplatek za platbu, ale i ceny jsou úplně jiné, než v automatu na ulici!!! Přijde mi to jako podvod. Hledám jinou aplikaci. | aplikace mi neposlala kód k ověření, takže ji nemohu použít | MPLA byla lepší z pohledu férovosti poplatků. | SMS code for registration dis not arrived on any phone mumber. Unable to register and use app. | Původní aplikace MPLA byla o 1000% použitelnější než je toto. Nekonečné kroucení kolečkem pro to aby člověk zjistil kolik stojí jaká doba parkování mě přivádí ke vzteku. Nakonec když se rozhodnu zaplatit, tak se platba strhne z karty až druhý den, takže si vlastně ani nejsem jistý jestli mám zaplaceno. Opravdu skvělá práce. Zrušit aplikaci co fungovala a nahradit ji tímhle diletantským pokusem jak co nejvíc naštvat lidi. | Doesn't work freezes and you think it's payed then you get a fine so they don't respect privacy and send you sms on Sunday or at 3 am | Stáhnul jsem aplikaci a ani po 3 hodinách mi nepřišel potvrzovací sms kód. | Platit další fee za kazde parkovani nechci. Diky | Po uniku uzivatelskych dat firmy me z aplikace byla vymazana platebni metoda a po parkovani me na druhy den firma kontaktovala, ze nemam zaplacene parkovani aniz by me nekdo informoval o tom, ze to z preventivnich duvodu smazali.

Hate this approach. Their web is not functional and customer service a disaster. | By far the best lowcost airline app yet. Works well, check in is easy. | They should add apple pay or google pay payment gateway instead of manual card insertion 
Overall everything is good | I never write reviews untill now. The experience when cancelling your flight at the very last moment was horrible. 

I undestand things can happen but then you have to make sure the clients are refunded and instead you send them theough compensation forms that dont work and wait on a customer chat about 40min each time to respond. 

Will never fly this airline again | Jsem absolutne nespokojen!!!!! 
Spolecnost zrusila muj let a presto ze uz jsem poslal 4 maily abych si vyridil nahradni let, stale nikdo nekomunikuje a neodpovida mi!!! Nabidli mi nahradni let FOR FREE, ale absolutne to nelze zaridit, presto ze jsem nasel nahradni! Na konec jsem musel letenku zaplatit znovu a vyssi cenu abych se vubec dostal domu!!! Ihned jak se vratim JDU ZA SVYM PRAVNIM ZASTUPCEM A BUDEME SITUACI RESIT PRAVNI CESTOU! Rozhodne chci sve penize zpet!!! Zruseni letu NENI MA CHYBA!!! Pochybuji ze v budoucnu jeste nekdy vyuziji tuto pochybnou spolecnost!!! | It used to be much more clearer ,what one buys!I | The only thing that the app is good for is online check in and pushing your boarding pass to Wallet. Several days before the flight you start receiving many notifications that are rather alarming than informing. So instead being relaxed you are going on holiday, you are constantly stressed, what’s happening. Also, there are misleading information about carry on baggage in the app or the gate staff is uniformed and rude. | 1 hour delay plus extra cost for cabin luggage that was not speed boarded is the same cheap trick that Ryanair does! I’ll do my best to avoid your airline in the future. See you never! | App and online site have been crashing and saying error for the last 5 hours | When I search the flights, they never load, like they are no flights.. | The best airline app i have ever experienced! 
Great job!
Love the apple pay feature👍 | To check your boarding pass, automatic brightness will make sure, you’ll know for sure you got it. | Krome | Very helpful | Po poslední aktualizaci mi zmizela všechna data z aplikace :-( | Easy & nice app, but you should add some form of booking or search sharing so I can share my searches with my friends. | rychle, pohodlne, operativni :) | Fee for changing booking is unbelievable. | I’ve very good experience with website | The check-in on your www pages is totally confusing. In the EasyJet app it is easy! | Very easy and fast boarding pass loading | With the app appeared always mistakes during process of check in, I had to call everywhere, no one could help me. Suddenly received email, followed instruction thru website and checked in already. But impossible with app. | Tried to check-in in the app. Impossible as Easyjet make you pay for the seat. I could not find option to skip out this and proceed to check-in. Did it on the classic desktop web. When I checked in, I could not retrieve the boarding pass back to the app (and wallet). Please improve the app compatibility with the standard interface and also enable to checkin within the app without having to pay for seat! | Úplná spokojenost!!! | Aplikace je prehledna, jednoducha a uzivatelsky prijemna (barvy, velikosti pisma, usporadani..).

 3) you have too much updates, no changelog 

4) Why is not possible COPY Confirmation code | Hosting not like discrimination
Delay in response with your issues 
If there a cancellation and refund it takes a long time
Customer service lies to the customer, the need to close a ticket no matter your issue.
Expensive fees no credibility that you will be in cleane host
The worst experiences i have before | The customer service response very late (you can wait for a response all day), every person there claims different thing, nothing seems to be valid and reliable. They are simply lying about something (the host confirmed with them a refund and agreed on it and they claim us he denied the refund, everything is written in the messages, what it is then??)

If anyone from the “support” team is reading this, I talk about reservation number: HM5QSE5ZBR. 

In this moment it seems we are loosing all our money for the stay (approx. 640 €) without staying not even a minute in the accommodation! 

I am really desperate now, because there is no way how to solve this from our side. 

We are just waiting whole day for a single message from them that is not solving anything. | Didn’t expect that company that positions itself user-driven, would prioritize the hosts over guests. 

Lately we had a horrible experience using the service. Not only the host ripped off us from stay in the booked apartment, but later Airbnb removed our review explaining it as “The guest didn’t stay there”. Just wow! Will never every use this service again and will caution everyone to consider using Booking or direct host booking systems as it’s way more reliable, user-friendly and often times chapter for the same quality. | Majority of hosts don’t care about common-sense sanitary rules, and AirBnb doesn't even send them basic instructions about that. 

Majority of reviews are overpositive, useless and do not mention any real issues. 

It used to be a nice authentic service, not it is dangerous scheme hurting your health and economy. 

If you arrive at a place you rented for a month, and it isn't as you expected so you decide to leave and the host agrees to send you part of your money back you will chat with more than 20 AB support managers who will write you huge meaningless letters and do not solve any of your issues. | The most horrible experience of your holidays is when your host cancel your accommodation the same day when you travel to your final destination and Airbnb didn’t find any solution to don’t finish on the street. The worst call center and comunication I have ever talk with. Never more!!! Be careful with this company! | Jedna z věcí, pro kterou s touto aplikací končím je, že pronajímatel vás nemusí akceptovat (u nás se to stalo ve dvou ze dvou případů), ceny nejsou, až tak výhodné oproti hotelům či penzionům a takzvané pet friendly ubytování je taky jeden velký výsměch… No, raději Booking, tam vás tolik “nevypečou”. | They will side with the owner and will refuse to give you back the cleaning fee even if you found excrements on your bed and you took photos or recorded. A situation like that ( no excrement ) happened to me. 

They won’t pressure the hosts to repair basic services of the apartment. God forbids that you are stuck one month in a situation like that, as it happened to me, where you claim that they cancel your reservation because of this. and give you a new option to stay, as where you live is almost unlivable. 

And you keep protesting and Airbnb only ignores you. | I cannot do anything since the app falls down all the time, like every ten secs. | Awful room (two different stays in Austria), poor support. Prices are same like in a hotel, but what you get for same money is horrific. | I’ve come back to this app after a few years and I feel like it’s gotten much worse. You can’t tell how much the stay is going to cost you until the very end. I had a very short time to book a room and I feel scammed. It’s a price you have these days to figure out what to avoid. 

Avoid this app, there are better alternatives out there. | Impossible to log in into a correct account. I can see one email in settings, I want to change it but it’s literally impossible as you are sending me an email with a button that redirects me to the starting page of the exact same account with no further guidance. Awful and not user friendly. | When you tap Show calendar from Booking information (on a host side), there is no way back from calendar. I must close entire app to get back to Home Screen. | So imagine you are on a budget on your vacation. You have last money to book a property that you carefully selected. You pay money, that are instantly taken away from your bank account. Now suddenly the owner of property cancels. And Airbnb says we will return money in two weeks! Hilarious. My bank provides instant payments. Meaning you can send money and receive them in seconds. So why the hell aribnb holds my money for 14 days!!!! Scammers. No other words.

Can you do something with that? | Aplikace je na mobilu zcela nefunkční, nepřehledná a zasekaná. | I booked an apartment for my stay in Berlin. Cheaper, ok looking apartment with shared kitchen and bathroom. When i arrived i was schocked as there was mold in the bathroom and kitchen. The stove had a hole in it and it was cracked. Oven smelled like it’s burning. There was something rotten in the dishwasher and I’m not talking about the rust in there. There was plenty of other things but i think you get the idea of it. We decided to leave earlier and i contacted the Air bnb support. I was hoping to get some help from them but instead they were on the owners side and didn’t do anything about it. Really dissapointed. There’s no need for a support team that’s not able to support 😅 | In new version it's not possible to fing accommodation without category filter, which is always applied to offer in table or in map. So you can not search for example accommodation for family in date. 🤬 | Everything is like perfect. When its not about refund. Like you must have to pay in like minutes, but when its time to refund? Nope, thats seems like impossible and you have to wait at least like 15 days… What a great system. :) | I am extremely dissatisfied, because due to the war 2022 in Ukraine, Airbnb restricted access not just to Russian accommodation facilities, but blocked the accounts of all Russian and Belorussian citizens! They overwhelmingly do not support this and their crazy government, but must suffer because of it! Even Booking didn't do that! Shame you, Airbnb! | Stupid search engine and useless sorting results. No customer support at all. In addition the racist company due to blocking russian people!

In Airbnb, the superhost hosted us by a jacket and then airbnb covered her all the time. When we asked when the jacket would come back to us, they stopped the conversation and so on - we solved it with them for about 2 months and without success. In the end, a friend in Italy helped us. Airbnb are such jerks that they didn't even allow us to edit the reference for the superhost | Be careful to use this app. I booked villa in Candidasa Bali and after payment it shows me the 10 steps on the way to villa nad it was 60 minutes ! I just lost 500$ and support dont want to help with anything. Use Booking! They will help you with all problems immidiately. On Airbnb support answer after 2 days and they wont to solve this … | Can you please add filter into search for Pet allowed? It was a realy helpful filter as there are many home owners who don’t allowed pets and now it can be seen only after checking House rules, which is quite time consuming and annoying. Thank you. | 100% jedna z nejlepších aplikací ke shánění pobytu. Je skvěle, intuitivně navržená, nehledě na neocenitelnost jejích funkcí. Doporučuji a doufám, že hostitelů bude jen přibývat. | Complete nonsense - all the personal data that the developers want + the app doesnt even work properly. 

 I tried to get a room for 1 night. The app wants to verify my phone number??! What for? I already share my names etc, i pay so why (verifying!) my phone. And next step “only one step, now we need your photo”. Guys, this is outrages!!! 

 Then i tried to pay. Changing from card to applepay - still my card is being charged??? Then the app screams my address is not ok, my country os highlighted in red… i change the country for the same (!) and it works. 
And finally i get a confirmation message “ [Airbnb] Your Most na Soči reservation is confirmed. Get a...” 

Get a .. what? 

 Far, far from easy one tap experience… and getting worse over the time | If the host cancel for no apparent reason, the famous Airbnb does give you a ridiculous refund, with no certainty to be able to find another accommodation. Absolutely unreliable. Won’t use it again. | Byli jsme jednoznacne podvedeni jednim z hostitelu. Pravidla airbnb ale tyto gengsty chrani.

However, if you don’t make a complaint within 24hrs Airbnb is not liable to help you.

What is an eSIM?
An eSIM is an embedded SIM card. It's built into your phone's hardware and serves the same function as a physical SIM. But it works 100% digitally.

Instead of dealing with a physical SIM card, you can purchase an eSIM, install it on your device, and instantly connect to a mobile network at your destination. No physical SIM cards, spotty Wi-Fi, or surprise roaming fees — just easy, affordable, flexible connectivity.

eSIM FAQ
What does an Airalo eSIM plan come with?
• An Airalo package comes with data (e.g., 1GB, 3GB, 5GB, etc.) valid for a specified time period (e.g., 7 days, 15 days, 30 days, etc.). If you run out of data or your validity period expires, you can top up your eSIM or download a new one right from the Airalo app.

How much does it cost?
• eSIMs from Airalo start from US$4.50 for 1GB of data.

Does an eSIM come with a number?
• Some eSIMs, including our Global Discover+ eSIM, come with a phone number so you can call, text, and access data. Check your eSIM's description for details. 

What devices are ready?
• You can find a regularly updated list of eSIM-compatible devices at this link:

Who is Airalo best for?
• Anyone who travels, whether it's for business or vacation.
• Digital nomads who need to stay connected to work while abroad.
• Crew members (e.g., seafarers, flight attendants, etc.) who need to stay connected while they travel.

Can I use my SIM card at the same time?
You sure can. Most devices allow you to use multiple SIMs and/or eSIMs simultaneously. You can keep your primary line active to receive text messages, calls, and 2FA authentication (but remember, they'll be subject to roaming fees).

Happy travels!

Jednoduchá instalace esim a snadné dobíjení. Super je i přehled spotřebovaného kreditu v aplikaci. Bezva je cashback z každého nákupu. | Super na cestování | As a first time user I needed a couple of minutes to look around to get it work but since then I am no longer worried about data nor dependent on wifi when travelling. With the global coverage airalo is offering and the super easy top up I think I am going to keep this app and the e-sim in my device for a very long time. | I had an issue with my internet. One day it completely stopped working. I tried rebooting the phone, turning on/off related toggles in settings and it started working again... not sure what happened and also what it fixed. | Foarte comod accesibil după preț. Și merge super. | ESim Airalo používám už potřetí. Pokaždé v jiné zemi (Kazachstán, Švýcarsko, Turecko).  Na začátku je to vždycky trochu napětí, kdy začne eSim fungovat. Měla jsem pocit, že vždy se to chovalo trochu jinak, přestože jsem postupovala dle instrukcí. Nicméně vždy se to rozběhlo, a data fungovala naprosto bezproblémově. 
Cena je možná vyšší, než když by si člověk koupil místní SIM, ale pořád mi více vyhovuje odjíždět z domova s tím, že na místě budu mít data okamžitě. 
Rozhodně doporučuji. | Amazing! Always works 🩷 | I used this app in Singapore and Bali. Everything was perfect, no issues. Really easy instalation with iPhone13. Thank you | It has 56GB remainkng but it stopped working. | Aplikace díky eSIM šetří dost peněz při cestování. 
Chtělo by to více tarifů s možnosti volání. 
Pak to bude dokonale. | Easy, quick, Smart... | Reasonable price in UAE and Turkey. Everything worked well.
 Now Thailand. Let’s see:) | The best options for internet when you travel . I used in Asia, Usa , Indonesia and Afrika and no problem .. Thanks | Skvela apka, ktera se hodi po celem svete. Jsem nadsenej | Skvělá a ještě lepší zákaznická podpora a navíc v češtině | Jednoduchá s rychlá instalace, po přistání se eSIM karta okamžitě spoji s místním operátorem a funguje vše jak má… Doporučuji 👍😃 | Mohu doporučit👍 | Žrout peněz a rychlost žádna. Raději koupit mistni sim a vyměnit. V Indii a v Thajsku nefunkči. Na reklamace odpovída robot. | Super!!!! Velmi doporučuji :) | V Omanu naprosto ok. Vetsinou 5G v okoli Salalah. | Naprostá spokojenost, absolutně se vším!! | Skvělá appka pro použití na cestách . Doporučuji. Cena excelentní , použití bezproblémové 👌👌 díky | 👍 | Trošičku složitější a problém pokud se přeruší instalace a nedokonči najednou | Vse fungovalo naprosto bez potizi | I am travelling with my husband on business trip.  I travel abroad with him most of the time.  When I am new in a country, I normally want to explore it alone.  With out an internet or data on my phone, it is hard to travel by public transport.  It is hard to know  the bus and train schedule to places where I want to go.  When I got this Airalo eSIM, travelling alone and exploring the city by public transport is not a problem anymore.

I highly recommend to get one when you are travelling abroad. | Went for a trip to California and purchased a data eSIM for very good price via this app. Both the purchase and activation were easy and what's most important the eSIM worked just great. | Vse funguje, jak ma :) | Smooth purchase, activation and run. Recommended! | Na cestování a být pořád online je to pecka. Miluju to, konečně žádné obtěžování operátorů v konečné destinaci. 
Děkuji za appku 😊👍🏼 | I recommend !!! good simple application, quick purchase, quick and simple installation according to the instructions that come to you and guide you step by step. I used it a few times, Thailand, it worked without a problem. I recommend !!!!!! | Absolutely happy with application, I have got what I wanted. I appreciate technical support for their proffesionáity and fast help. | Just used it in Thailand and Singapore. All without problem, easy installation, also when I had a question, they replied instantly. | Best!!! | Easy to install, the app guides you through purchase and install… you can also buy e-sim for your relatives/friends and install via QR code on their phones, especially useful for children that cannot have apple pay due to Apple’s age restrictions. Used in Thailand with no issues. | The data disappears itself without using. Out of 10G was able to use 1G when it counted that 10G was used. The same happened for another traveler. Not sure if it concerns Mexico only but will never use again! | Supr aplikace,odzkouseno v Thajsku a funguje na 1*. Snadna instalce,sluzby.👍 | Spokojenost 100% 💪👍😎 | Za mě osobně jednoduchá registrace jednoduchý nákup, sim budu zkoušet až na konci února tak pak napíšu zkušenost s aktivací a použitím. | I use Airalo every time I travel outside of EU and it has made getting connected practically hassle free. No need to look for vendors figure out if the price is right, switching sims, etc. Just click, pay, surf. :) | It´s working correctly, but It´s recomended to install eSIM in prior and activate it in the target country. | Great for traveling, easy to use. | Jasně, asi se víc vyplatí pořídit si SIM někde u obchodníka v dané zemi, ale shánějte v některých exotických zemích kde se vlastně ta sim dá koupit. Co mě zaujalo, i zde funguje “specifický” český trh: u O2 CZ karty začíná běžet odpočet platnosti karty okamžikem nákupu. U ostatních je to vždy až okamžikem připojení do podporované sítě.  Takže ze strany CZ operátora pěkný ojeb. | Vše OK. | Po zakoupeni a instalaci karta nefungovala . Byl jsem nucen koupit novou. Po opětovném dobití se nechtěla znovu aktivovat. Až po zapnuti a vypnutí režimu letadlo se znovu aktivovala | V USA a v Turecku ozkoušeno a super. 
Jednoduché a rychlé
Provozováno na IPhone 12Pro, 13Pro 14Pro a 15Pro | Svoji funkci plní to je v pořádku ale chybí kontrola konci expirace popřípadě využití. Po ukončení simkarty není v aplikaci žádná historie že by tam byla karta uložena že je neaktivní popřípadě kolik stála a podobné informace které bych od archivu očekával. Měl jsem problémy vzpomenout si kdy expirace končí a musel jsem to najít v bance podle platby. To se mi zdá jako nekomfortní | Thus is an excellent option for a traveller. Easy to use, automatic setup and easy to activate.
First I was reluctant, so I made a test. I bought the smallest package for 6$ for my home country and it worked perfectly!
After that I was confident to buy for Turkey, Qatar and Tanzania, where my trip was taking me. The only issue I faced was in Zanzibar, because the Tanzanian partner, Vodacom, has a very weak signal on the island. It works perfectly on tge mainland, but not in Zanzibar.

They cancel our flight few days before departure and proposed another flight same day of the return flight. They make everything they can to make you pay your seats and boarding pass. They allocated random seats to us completely at the opposite site of the plan. First and last time I book my flight with this company! | I was not able to pay for the seating in app.I tried it several times and the payment was 7xrefused.Finally I had to pay it in Notebook. | I would expect that boarding pass would be able to share better than as a picture. But to be able for other travelers to place it in the wallet or other apps. Otherwise good app. | Today I tried to buy a flight with wizzair on the web. When I got to registration , bad luck ""Registration failed"", no more info, tried couple of times. Okay let's try the app. Bingo, I was able to register, got the the payment ""Payment failed"". There is no issue with my card/limits on it. App itself is beautiful and fast. But obviously testing teams have problems with regression testing, because these kinds of issues are those that will cost you customers in production. I'll fly with other company. | App full of bugs, refusing payment, crashing etc. | Perfektní let, skvělý palubní tým, kapitán přistál o 10 minut dříve a pomohl nám tak stihnout další vnitrostátní let. Děkujeme ! | Bezplatne nemuzete sedet ani s dcerou. Ubohe. | Half the time you get errors. Then when trying to follow links from the email it says booking not found. Worst UX design and worst app to ever be created. | This app is really useless! We flew from Rome Fiumicino, which usually takes 30 minutes from center. All trains to Fiumicino were for 4 days cancelled, instead of them they provide the Bus transport, which takes 1,5hour! and goes only each hour. Cannot understand why the app doesn ´t note you these quite important information about AirPort transport. Because  of this, although we were on the Train station at right time, we came to the AirPort at the Gate-close time….You cannot find any contact, any phone number, e-mail address, except of a stupid bot Amelie🙈 Hundred of advertisements what to buy, but no care about you when you have already baught. With this company no more. | I was checking in very early and still they split our family of 3. It is clear, that they want us to buy the seats. My husband sits somewhere else. Wouldnt mind if we were friends. Like this it is really disapointing! | I was supposed to have set together but it didn’t happen… | The app reloads if you switch to another app for some seconds. The app designers have intentionally drowned options, so it isn’t quick and easy. Features and options are cumbersome and difficult to understand and use. Seems like WizzAir doesn’t want you to use what you pay for. Overall this app and WizzAir are my last choice when flying. | I have paid my tickets in January and did not received tickets or my money back till now, i have made a claim to solve this problem (because there is no FREE costumer servis, only a paid callcenter which is not worth Your money - only thing They said is that they can not do a thing and You should make a claim) so soon after i made a claim i realized they take about 30 days to answer, unfortunatelly after 30 days You get an automatic message, after 4 of these messages i received a message that i have right to get my money back, after 30 long days i got another message saying: “Your claim has been resolved.” But as You can say from this review i did not receive any amount of money back. So i made a second claim saying that if i get no response soon i’ll go to police, after a couple hours i got a response from one of WIZZ Air’s employee asking for comfirmation of that payment. After i sent it i got a message saying he/she is going to forward it to a financial department (that will take some days he/she said) and that if i have any other questions, i can reply to that mail and he/she will answer them. So couple days passed and i asked if there is some News about it, no response. After a month i wrote another and got no response as well.
I’ll take this review back as soon as i get my money back. | Closing itself | Dear wizzair team, As long as I enjoy the prices your company offers for the tickets and the design of your mobile application, your anti bot system is just horrible. Like seriously, what the hell? I change the dates for the tickets couple times to find a good offer and it kicks me out suspecting in being a bot, while I am not, and there is nothing I can do about it? Like guys, fix it please, its impossible to use the app without frustration. Add some option for people to proof they are not bots! Thanks | We were stuck at the airport for 5 hours because of the delayed flight and all we’ve got was a voucher for only 4 euros so we could hardly afford a bottle of water. Plus we didn’t get any information about the reason for the delay, which is unacceptable. I must praise Ryanair whose services are much better than Wizz Air’s. If you want to experience complete deception, then book a flight at Wizz Air. Btw the app is useless and throws random errors. | Tha app is soooo slow. You should’ve an it guy have a look at it | Nestabilní, pomalé a nepřehledné, opakovaně se nechce připojit. | It is impossible to contact them when you have a problem. It also happened to me that I chose a service for XXX amount of money and when I wanted to pay for that in the next step, the price was suddenly double. Definitely will avoid wizz next time. | Long responses, prepaid services not visiblr when booked over a third party | Really 50 eur for offline check in, really not possible to pay on the desk? | Při koupi letenek jsem si připlatil za sedadla. U online odbaveni jsem musel znovu vybírat a platit za sedadla. Nechapu. | Nelze ulozit let pred check in do systemu ktery kupoval nekdo jiny | При покупке билетов мне пришло сообщение из другого приложения, перешел в него, а когда вернулся, через 15 секунд, то пришлось начинать покупку заново. Я уже был на оплате🤦🏼‍♂️ | If you forget online check-in in 3 hours before a take off, you will pay to these thiefs 50 EUR per person for offline check-in! Have a nice holiday! | Check in better as website
Clear menu
On-line procedure in airport
Czech language for older people | The app says I am offline when trying to check-in. I would not be able to write a review if that would be true.  Check-in is unavailable also on their website. Congratulations Wizzair! | App looks really good, but the work with it is just horrible. Sometimets it won’t change you a date and you don’t know why, then you can’t scan the documents and the funniest thing is, that it says “your device does not have internet connection” but it does, all other apps work, internet browser works, all good. Just this app take 1 hour of your life to make you try to check-in and when you are finally done you recieve pdf file which says “this is not a boarding card”. Thank you Wizz Air. Good job. | Perfect! | Why no info about delay? This is why I enabled notificatins, not to get promotions regularly... | Not able to start up the app. Network error. | To change the incorrect date of Birth? Impossible… Petr.O | I ordered, reserved and paid transport from hotel to AirPort, because it was ordered in app and seems it can be easy way to arrange transport to flight. Everything confirmed and paid and nobody picked us!!! And yet nobody returned payment, after complaint in app, after complaint in e-mail. Nobody reply and keept money for service they didnt provide. 1 star is minimum, for me 0 stars!!! | I Really do not recomend this airline. Our flight was diverted to another location. They did not help us find another flight and they even did not give us compensation for buing another flight to out final destination. If you want to stay out of problem, do not choose this airline. | This app is a total scrap. It doesn’t remember anything once you jump to another app and back. You can’t use applepay. My VISA card didn’t work as well. | I’ve made check in 2 days before via this app and still paying 71£ for check in on airport two people awesome!! It is working well for profit ;) thank you! | Pokud chci zaplatit letenku v CZK, musim pouzit jinou kartu nez VISA ke korunovemu uctu. Ta hlasi chybu, ze banka transakci zamitla. Bylo u banky dvakrat overeno, ze uhrada pro overeni u banky ani nedosla a kartu mam nastavenou spravne, dostatek hotovosti, povolene MO/TO transakce. 
Platby v EUR s VISA kartou k eurovemu uctu funguji. | Po poslední aktualizaci je aplikace celá v italštině, i když mám nastavenou angličtinu. Změna nastavení jazyka nepomůže. | Doesn't work... I'm not able to sign in - it always say ""wrong email or password"" - I've reset my password, sign in worked in the internet browser, but not in the app... Still the same... I'm copying the email and the password too... so no chance of typo... | Замовив білети до Кутаїсі із Праги, оплатив їх банківським переказом, гроші відправились, а білетів моїх нема в аплікації wiz air,  дальше висвічується в телефоні, що вони неоплачені. Телефоную на гарячу лінію, а на гарячій лінії ВІДКЛЮЧЕНИЙ ТЕЛЕФОН!!!!! Ця компанія - АФЕРИСТИ!!!!! Не користуйтесь їхніми послугами!!! | I don’t remember this app ever worked well. 
Last many years always behaving weird and without any sense.
Today I just logged in and there are no booked flights. If I search for them manually, it finds the reservation I made and ask me to log in (but I logged in the beginning).
After second log in the app forward you to internet browser for further steps and get stuck. Why do they develop the app when they still redirect you to browser? | Boarding passes cannot be downloaded. Useless app. | It does not work adding to personal calendar - app always fall down. Please fix it. | Please just spend some money on testing your app. Try to download or save ticket to wallet from Kutaisi airport. Thank you very much for wasting my time... | We almost missed our flight because of this stupid app. It is valid not only for app itself, but also for website. I wanted to download and print boarding pass (because Kutaisi airport does not support boarding pass in app) and it took me like one hour to download required PDF. After I finished online check-in,  I clicked on download button. Then I was able to see PDF but not to download it (no button or anything). When I tried to repeat the process through website, my upcoming flight was not listed and I had to find it manually through some obscure and hidden search field (despite the fact  I already did online check-in before). After I found the flight, I was able to download ticket for my girlfriend, but not for me! What the hell? We had to use another device to download second ticket (where btw was not possible to show the first one). Really, I just hope their pilots are more capable than their IT team. | ორმხრივი ფრენის ნაცვლად მხოლოდ ცალს აჩვნებს, გაფრენა და უკან დაბრუნება რომ ერთდროულად ეძებო არგამოდის. | I could not be happier with this app. Can’t remember the last time it crashed (if ever), works like a charm, remembers all the credentials, cards, keeps all my tickets sorted neatly.

Pridana hodnota aplikace je temer nulova. | Nehodlám platit další měsíční / roční paušály, takže aplikace letí okamžitě do koše. Naprosto nevhodný monetizační model aplikace, který spoustu lidí odradí. | Appku mám už 2 roky a s nápady v ní jsem spokojená. S čím bohužel nejsem spokojená je doba načítání daného místa, padání appky, zasekávání se. Děje se to posledního půl roku a je to otrava. | Bohuzel nic noveho a zajimaveho zde nenajdete. Mista jsou stejna jako v Uzasna mista, jen rozdil je, ze za PlaceHunter si zaplatite. 🤷🏼‍♀️ | Absolutely useless app. Even with paid premium there are very vew places. This will not help you find interesting places at all. :-( | Why is here this app which is not free and you have to pay a money for using it???!!! | It would be nice to have the information about only 7 days trial version after you have to to pay for it somewhere in the description of the app | nic moc, jsou to proflakly mista, ktery jsou verejne znamy, sem tam neco zajimavyho, nicmene za tu cenu to fakt nestoji... | Aplikace je to hezká a hezké tip i popis ale nikde jsem nenašel zrušení placeného členství a když kliknu v aplikaci na nastavení, tak aplikace spadne…. | Prvně musím pochválit záměr, super a líbí se mi, ale obdobných cestovatelských aplikací / www je již mnoho, proto je s čím srovnávat.
Negativni je rychlost aplikace - velice pomalá, načítání míst dost tragédie.
Nepřesvědčil mne princip zneviditelnění 4/5 míst v aplikaci. Tudy cesta nevede, nabídněte prémium obsah u míst a některé funkcionality za upgrade, potom to má smysl. Tento princip zpoplatnění aplikace je pro mne neakceptovatelný.
Ještě nějaký měsíc počkám, dle vývoje projektu buď rád zaplatím nebo smažu. | Bezplatná verze má uzamčenu většinu míst a je tam nepoužitelná, u placené verze cena nastavená nezdravě. Dále je v aplikaci bug, při otevření “nastavení” apka spadne. Při smazání tak nemáte možnost zrušit registraci. | Skvělá aplikace ve které je stále co nového objevovat. Z počátku užívání jsem měla jen free verzi a i s tou se dá skvěle vystačit na spoustu výletů. 🥰 | Placehunter je skvělá věc. Velmi oceňuji možnost filtrování podle úrovně, vhodnosti pro kočárky. Spojení s amazing plaves a gastro mapou je naprostá dokonalost. | Velmi málo tipů na to, že se jedná o placenou aplikaci za ne zrovna směšnou částku. | Clicked on unsubscribe 3 times, also write an email them and still getting annoying spam | Aplikaci jsem si stáhla již jednou v létě 2021 a byla jsem opravdu zklamaná z počtu přidaných míst, která jsou navíc extrémně profláknutá a na kterých jsem z 90% procent byla.

Květen 2022, naprosto nic se v aplikaci nezměnilo, počet míst stejný, bez zaplacení člověk nic neuvidí a jakmile zaplatí, tak to za ty peníze absolutně nestojí.

Pro rodiny s dětmi naproti nepoužitelná. S dětmi nemůžete jet několik hodin přes půlku republiky, abyste se podívali na nějakou vámi nazývanou “zajímavost”. 

Chápu koncept, ale sami máte sponzory, tak využijte peníze, které vám dali, k vylepšení aplikace. Placená verze s tímto počtem míst, která všichni znají nebo se zobrazí mezi prvními na googlu, nemá žádný význam, když kousek od vámi uvedeného místa jsou mnohem zajímavější a klidnější místa. 

Je potřeba rozšířit tým o další členy. Dva lidé nejsou schopni zvládnout všechno. Sežeňte si aspoň copywritera na popisky a přidávání míst do aplikace. | Aplikace Hezká, skvělé fotky co lakaji k návštěvě. Bohužel na to ze aplikace je mesicne placena tak je tam malo mist.
Treba se to nekdy vyplati, ale vzhledem k tomu ze vyhledavani informaci je zdarma a da se najit prakticky cokoliv je tohle proste prestreleny.
V budoucnu si to treba z pohodlnosti nekdy zaplatim, sle zs me zatim nema smysl. | Podle apky jsem cestoval celé léto i zimu. Teď se chystám na daší výlety a uvidíme co budete mít v Rakousku! 😊👏 | Zaplatila jsem si premium v nadeji, ze se mi odemkne mapa zaplnena napady, bohuzel se tak nestalo, vyhozenych 80 kc. Skvely napad, zkusim znova treba za dva roky, az pribude nejaky obsah. | I wanted to check out some unknown places in Prague and there are only 8 points in the whole city and they are all locked because you need the paid version of the app. I guess I'd rather google than pay money for it to recommend me to go look at Kafka's head 😄. | Bez zaplacení se podíváte na pár míst 40km+ daleko. Koncept appky je fajn, ale i na náhledu míst, kterých jména jsou otevřené jen pro předplatné, toho není zase tolik, aby si člověk chtěl platit. | Těšil jsem se, že v ČR možná našel někdo hezká přírodní místa… bohužel jsem se mílil.. opět si pouze zde myslíme že je to zde krásné… oproti zahraničí těžká bída a hnůj. 
Aplikaci nedoporučuji je k ničemu. | Google vám najde zadarmo vše ve vašem okolí, opravdu zbytecne platit za tuhle zbytečnost. | Super appka, nemůžu si na nic stěžovat. Jediné, co mě trochu mrzí, je neaplikovaný tmavý režim při otevření konkrétní lokality. Když už je menu v tmavém režimu, bylo by hezčí to mít v tmavém kompletně všechno. Myslím, že by to neměl být takový problém. | Yes, it’s really amazing app, especially for people like me, who want to discover new and even not so well-known (and because of that also less crowded) cinematic places. Thank you for creating this app. 🙂 | Appka mi poprvé totálně zasekala mobil, radši Mapy.cz které jsou zdarma, toto je trapná napodobenina - 79,-/měsíc bo ročně 649,- jako vážně? 😂 | Aplikace je přehledná a pěkná, ale vzhledem k tomu, ze je zde velice málo uzamcenych mist, tak mě nic nemotivuje k tomu za aplikaci platit. Takže napad pěkný, užitečný pro protestovali ČR, ale chtělo by to ještě zapracovat má obsahu a hlavně místech k navstiveni. | Aplikace moc pěkná po vizuální stránce. Ocenil bych ale možnost nahlédnout jaké místa jsou v okolí (například skrze trial). Jinak nemůžu vědět, že v premium verzi nebudou v celém mém okolí zrovna jen 3 místa, které navíc už můžu znám. | Absolutně mi nedává smysl platit měsíční paušál za pár míst po Česku. Chválím možná tak design, ale je tu spoustu dalších aplikací zdarma. | Fotky pěkné, ale tím to končí. Rýžovat na tom,že prozradíte místo kde udělat pěknou fotku mi přijde špatný. Navíc, většinu výletu si můžete najít zadarmo do 5minut na Instagramu. Ale fotky pěkný. | Líbí se mi vzhled a zpracování aplikace ale spoustu míst ,které jsou v placené verzi i zdarma známe a proto z mi zakoupení a používání aplikace přijde zbytečné. Možná když pojedu někam kde to neznám tak asi dobrý. | Aplikace je krásně zpracovaná, ale bohužel ve verzi zdarma je opravdu málo míst a nevidím zde motivaci k zaplacení cele verze. Popisy jsou nic moc a hodně míst z výběru zdarma jsem třeba já osobně již navštívila a není to pro mě takovým přínosem. Mnohem lepší mi přijde aplikace TripAdvisor, kde je opravdu nespočet míst v cele Evropě a aplikace je zdarma. | Dobrý nápad, bohužel zatím velmi málo míst a k tomu ještě předplatné... | Super aplikace pro výlety po ČR. Krásné popisky míst, že si člověk muže vybrat na co se cítí. 
Není tam zbytečně každý kopec, ale opravdu jen místa, co do sebe něco mají 👌😊. | Bohužel aplikace zdarma ukazuje jen několik míst, což nedává prakticky žádný smysl. Jediným účelem je tedy dohnat uživatele k zaplacení poplatku… | Aplikace jako taková je moc pěkně udělaná a je mi jasné,že zabrala dost práce. Sama nemám zas tolik procestovanou republiku a některá místa jsem neznala,ale je pro mě obrovské zklamání cena vs. výkon. Cena k typu aplikace je ok(bežně se dnes platí většina platform)-ale zde je strašně málo výletů, popisy jsou často velmi stručné a odfláklé. Argument -že budou místa přibývat mi přijde neadekvátní-tak by se vyplatilo tedy se spuštěním počkat/přizvat si někoho na pomoc (což chápu že nechcete).Jedná se vlastně hlavně o tipy na insta fotky zajímavých míst lahodící oku. U mnohých krásných míst jsou ještě zajímavější v okolí a ne tolik profláklá, která mi chybí a mnohdy je v ap.jen to nejprofláknutější.Celkově mi chybí přidaná hodnota nad rámec fotky. Inspirují mě fotky míst focené z drona-ale prostě v NP a CHKO apod..se lítat nesmí,ani u přírodních památek bez patřičných povolení. Zajímalo by mne jak toto řešíte? Ráda se inspiruji i radou jak na tuto problematiku, byla by to úžasná přidaná hodnota 🙂.Každopádně zůstávám připojená a počkám si dál a budu vám držet palce..zkuste se zamyslet jak dál protože máte úžasný nápad a skvělý potenciál, z mého pohledu absolutně nevyužitý v tuto chvíli. | Appka ma pekny design, tim ale vycet pozitiv konci. Neplacena verze na mape ukazuje malo mist, ktere jsou jeste k tomu zcela proflakle (Morava). Nevidim nic, za co bych chtel zaplatit. V podstate to ukazuje mista na mape - to same co vsechny ostatni mapy. Appku hned odinstalovavam a vracim se k mnohem promakanejsim mapy.cz ktere jsou zdarma. | Chybí mi možnost zaplatit jednorázově plnou verzi. Nerad si kupuji pouze časově omezené licence. | Tak to nemá chybu 👏! Čím míň času strávím plánováním, tím víc času mám na cestování! Skvělá aplikace => výběr top výletů, přehledná, úžasný design, luxusní foto, potřebné informace, prostě díky za práci, kterou pro nás děláte! Jsem nadšená! #jsemplacehunter | It is only about money. You will destroy nice places, which are relatively calm and unknown. You destroy everthing that travelers guard. You make money thanks to nature. Travelling to secret places is about to spend time to find them, to ask people living nearby and to enjoy searching. It will be the same story as with the look-out “Máj”. Also, the design is stolen from “Gastromapy”. | Přehledná aplikace, krásný design, všechny potřebné informace na jedné straně. Za mě naprostá spokojenost! | This app is absolutely stunning and I would really recomed it to everyone. The grafic of the app is amazing. I trully love it. | Dobře se používá a obsahuje opravdu ta nejlepší a nezajímavější místa, must have pro každého cestovatele! | Je skvely ze konecne nekdo prisel s vyctem toho nejlepsiho, uz me nebavilo listovat tisici vagnich mist a znich nasledne vybirat. Skvely napad. Zaroven skvele nadesignovana aplikace, se super fotkami. Diky | nice interface! | Užitečná aplikace poukazující na to, že v Česku může být stejně krásně jako v zahraničí, stačí jen najít ta správná místa s čímž si tahle apka ví opravdu rady. | Designově

Platím si už druhým rokem a vše funguje, jak má. Výborně fungují i další přidaná místa. 
Jediný černý puntík za obsah článků, některé jsou napsané v tendenčním progresivistickém duchu. Ale co už. 🤷‍♀️ | Dobrý den, pozor na verzi zdarma je poté 1/3 plochy apky v režimu tzv reklamní plocha. | Jsem velmi spokojená
Vše vám vychází a můžu se spolehnout a dle počasí si naplánovat výlet😀 | This is the best weather app. I'm using it few times every day. Therefore I decided for payed version. 
The only one thing which is missed is dark mode 😉 | Latest update doesn’t allow user to opt out of data collection. So, goodbye Weather Radar! My data is my business and not for sale! | Předpověď s velkou úspěšností, málokdy je aktuální situace jiná než je v předpovědi. | Jediným kladem na téhle aplikaci je hezký widget. Počasí podle jejich předpovědi nikdy nevyjde. Třeba dnes mělo v Liberci pršet jen kolem čtvrté ráno a dopoledne přecházet do polojasna. Realita? Od včerejší noci prší, dnes celý den mrholí, nebo prší | Fajn aplikace až na nově vyskakující reklamy na celou plochu . Zvlášť ráno bez brýlí je to s tím malým křížkem na zavření k vzteku . Jinak super. | Proč mám najednou reklamy v placené verzi? Opravte si tu chybu. Měli byste vracet předplatné. Jak se toho zbavím? | Kdysi nejlepší apka, ale dnes je to spíš samá reklama. | Člověk si platí předplatné, aby neměl reklamy a  i tak je tam má. Jinak co se týká předpovědi, tak asi nejpřesnější aplikace. | To expensive | Dobrý den, mám placenou verzi a aplikaci mám plnou reklam. Proč? 
Děkuji | Vždy doprovazi na cestach kde se nacházim
Díky | Výborné informace k plánování volného času | Nefunguje radar pro Nová Ves v Horách . Stále načítání | Nefunkční radar !! | Oproti jiným aplikacím i meteostanicím ukazuje vždy o 2-3 stupně více. Nejlepší na ní je radar. Widget na to, jak je velký, toho moc neumí a nelze si jej upravit. Co se updatů týče, tak klidně 3x po sobě je uváděn ten samý popis novinek. Škoda, protože jinak celkem ujde. | It not even know actual weather. Ot say partly cloudy and windy - outside is actually kind of huricane and realy rainy. Useless. | Top | Need baví button  reject optional cookies | ok | Využívám denně, i několikrát, je to super ! Vím, kdy mám jít se psem, abych nezmokla, kdy tolik nemrzne nebo není vedro. Je to už součást mého života. Díky za to. | Zatím nevím ! | Widgets are so bad | Asi nejlepší předpověď. Vychází nejčastěji,
je dostatečně podrobná. | Přehledná, obsahuje vše potřebné pro aktuální vývoj počasí.
Reklamní plochy jsou už ale zbytečně velké! | Po aktualizaci hlásí nezmysly. | Super aplikace. | Předpověď je dosti nepřesná spis je to ukázka toho jaké počasí nebude | Až na reklamy super | venku prší a na aplikaci je bez deště celý den úplně zbytečná aplikace nejde se podlesi toho řídit spíš takova tipovačka | Proč se v placené verzi neustále objevuje na druhém místě  “chcete oznámit zprávy ….” se zvonečkem a nejde to odstranit!! | Nechci, aby tam skákala neustále nějaká reklama ! To radši budu platit nějaký jednorázový roční paušál. | Chtělo by to widgety na display hodinek a ne jen logo , ale například aktuální počasí a další , děkuji . | Velmi kvalitní,pravdivá,dostačující aplikace na počasí | Spokojenost  ,na vítr a teplotu s ohledem na moje venkovní aktivity prima. | neustále aplikace vypadává nebo nenačitá  den max dva dny funguje | Počasí radar zkouším na více kontinentech a musím říci, že nikde předpověď nebyla daleko od pravdy!! Maximální spokojenost. Doporučuji! | Dobrý den.Docela jste rychlí jako blesk!!V 11.40 hod mi přišlo oznámení ať se podívám na radar kdy dorazí déšť!!!Docela dobre až na to ze mate skoro dvě hodiny zpoždění ,protože tak dlouho zde již prší!!! | Otravná reklama, která trvá příliš dlouho a tlačítko na přeskočení videa nefunguje!! Musíte čekat příliš dlouho, než reklama sama skončí. To je moc. Budu užívat jinou apku 😬 | Až příliš reklam. Aplikaci bych si i koupil, ale ne za cenu předplatného. Odinstalováno. | Vše v pořádku | Vše je pěkné, až na to, že mně obtěžují reklamy a to zrovna na radaru. Něco snesu, ale.jsou čim dál delší! | Líbí se mi tato aplikace protože je přehledná a docela přesná. | Občas to vyjde občas tase ne | Apsolutni jednička. Zakoupil jsem prémii a všem doporučuji.

Blbý ale když nikam nejedete, tak pořád spamuje notifikacemi.

PS: Na podporu jsem psal před třemi měsíci, mezi tím párkrát poslal screenshot notifikací které mi neměly přijít ale nic se nezměnilo. | I’m not a daily taxi user, but kept the app installed just in case. From time to time, I enjoyed the features, such as reservation with child seat, etc.

But recently they started to abuse notifications and send me irrelevant marketing stuff. I don’t want to turn off the notifications, because this is taxi app, I need them.

I decided I’ll just uninstall the whole app because of this. Sorry, not sorry. If you guys give me no change than to either suffer through your marketing stuff or have no notifications on, then I use the same logic and just decide that it’s either app installed or not 🤷‍♂️ | Konečně taxi na vyšší úrovni - potěší | Vše v pořádku | Most expensive taxi apo silution in Prague. It does not offer any benefits than competition, even if they claim otherwise. I am using taxi almost every day and zero problems, if some they are minor and not app specific. I checked today and prices are often double the competition. | Super čistota vozu…znalost Prahy na jedničku…skvělé,že jezdí Češi…. | this app, otherwise moderately useful, is sending me unwanted notifications without my consent.

Děkuji i takto na dálku z Ljubljany
Šimeček
Generali Investments CEE | Naprosto perfektní!

Můžu si vybrat řidiče, který mě odveze podle, podle sebe, což jinde nejde…

+ super možnost poslat balíček kurýrem nebo ho nechat vyzvednout 🔥 | To this day, Liftago doesn’t support Apple Pay and that’s basically the whole reason why I am not using it. The sheer inconvenience, let alone questionable security of the facelt that you need to manually add your card and verify it… Nope. Let alone when you have SEVERAL cards. I’ll stick with the competition, sorry. | Pokud hledáte alplikaci, kde si Vy sami budete moct zvolit řidiče, který Vás odveze z místa A do místa B - rozhodně doporučuji po dlouholetém ježděním s aplikací Liftago! 
Proč je to nejlepší aplikace na ""spolujízdu"" / vyhledání řidiče / taxislužba BEZKONKURENČNÍ vzhledem k podobným nejmenovaným aplikacím..?!
1. Můžete si řidiče samy ZVOLIT (v konkurenčních aplikacích Vám ho přiřadí 😑) řidiče
aneb přesně s kým pojedete: dle profilové fotky,  hodnocení a i typu auta a ceny! 
2. Můžete si zvolit přesný model auta (ne jen ""premium"" atd) a spolu s výše uvedenými kriterii VYBRAT KOLIK ZAPLATÍTE
3. VŠICHNI ŘIDIČI MLUVÍ PLNĚ ČESKY! 
4. Za 5 let, co s Liftagem jezdím takřka denně, mám zkušenost: Řidiči jsou VŠICHNI opravdu na úrovni, milý a dobrý řidiči
5. I volba vozu ""STANDART"" je na mnohem vyšší úrovni jak u konkurence
6. CENA JE STEJNÁ jak u konkurence, mnohdy NIŽŠÍ 

& mnoho dalších výhod | Dekuji | Aplikace byla sveho casu asi jedina a mela potencial, v posledni dobe je to ale uz kostrbaty.
Jelikoz navic firma prohlasila ze je pouze pro LGBT tak nezyva nez smazat. Skoda. | Vse OK, doporucujeme :-) | Skvělá taxi aplikace s poctivými a příjemnými řidiči. | Hnus , chování řidiče k zakaznikovi je rasistické !!! | Liftago is the best and safest taxi app in the Czech Republic. They have only certified drivers with a proper license who speak Czech. What’s more, you can choose your driver based on price, car model, rating or even on their handsome face :)
So you never have to be worried that a weirdo in a beat up old car will show up who will try to sell you hookers (a true story from another app) | Jen se za kvalitu platí, ale aspoň vám narozdíl od Boltu neukradnou věci, které si v autě necháte. 10/10 | Jde Vám to skvěle! | Od objednání přijel ještě o 5 min dříve než ukazoval systém, velice příjemný a komunikoval i v tak pozdní dobu, velice děkuji | Objednáno aplikací za určitou cenu. Po dojezdu cena vzrostla o 30% než v aplikaci. | Perfektní!!! | Po poslední aktualizaci mám technické problémy a nezobrazují se mi pravé probíhající jízdy. Vaše aktualizace šla k horšímu!!!! | No way to enter the Moneyback “promo code” into the app. Always showing “invalid code”… | Bolt aplikace je po vsech strankach lepsi. Lepsi ceny, rychlejsi prijezdy apod.

Děkuji za toleranci kterou zákazníkům dáváte, já spustil aplikaci, objednal auto a vůbec si nevšiml že adresa ani jednoho místa nesouhlasí . Objednávka bez jakékoliv pokuty zrušena, opravena, a odeslána znovu . Můj vůz přidej a řidič byl velký profesionál s dobrou náladou 👍 | Jízda byla OK | Vše OK.

I was planning complex US trip and TripIt served well. I am using it for every trip since then and I am very satisfied. Worth of try. | Great app, but where’s Sign In with Apple? | I enjoy travelling with this App, very handsful at places like airports or hotels- every document you can get immediately on hand. | I really like the app. All the trips details in one place, much better than finding all flight tickets in my email box | Wonderful app, no need of multiple note, everything you need to know are in a single place and accessible in one click. | Easy to use | Try to close your account. Cannot find such option? You have to Google it. It’s not in the app, so you need to login to website. Login with Facebook there (as you did with the app), close your account and guess what? It asks you for password. What password? I loogged in with Facebook! So I need to go log out, click Forget password, reset my password, log in again, close my account, confirm with new password and tadaaa! The app is finally away. I wasted too much of my time with it... | I'm afraid that version for iPad is not very good. For new plans you can not set a time zone, also it does not recognize the address even if it visible on the map to assign correct time zone.
Dear developers, please spend 15 minutes with the app to setup trip within various time zones on iPad and you will know immediately what to fix. | Simple, clear, in short the best app of this kind | Very good application. I moved to TripIt from WorldMate and I am happy with the functionality and look and feel of the app. The only thing I would like to get improved is the handling of the on-line checking from the app. | TripIt is perfect tool/app for all kinds of travelers. It makes your travel plan so easy and just one click away. | Serious traveller? You need a serious travel tools, TripIt is an automatic part of your comfortable journeys!! | Neustále mně vyzívá abych odeslal zpět link a po té,že mě to pustí k využití aplikace, ale žádný meil nepřišel,přesto že jsem několikrát odinstaloval pro mě nepoužitelné,možná kdyby to fungovalo tak by to mohlo být dobré | Paradni, intuitivni aplikace pro planovani cest, vyletu i expedic. Vse prehledne, na jednom miste. Kdyz vas jede skupina, vse muzete sdilet, co rezervuje jeden, to vidi a mohou dale doplnovat ostatni. Takhle to ma fungovat! 

1 hvezdicku ubiram kvuli tomu, ze se nedari uploadovat nektere fotky, treba kabinu letadla, abychom si mohli udelat dobry seating na letisti...

Ale vcelku - skvela vec! | Skvelá app hlavne na tripy s viac prestupmi a podobne | Whit this app is traveling really easy and fun. You will always have accurate info about flights or your bookings. | Very useful and nice app to plan trips. | Helpful while being on the move! Missing more possibilities to proactively handle my reservations and flight tickets. | Hi, I can totally recommend this app, it works fine, and you does not have to be always online to see your ravel schedule. I do lately travel eastern Europe and there some of the airlines are not supported for follow up. As well as some terminal and gate info is missing. But overall great app, big helper no need to carry with you papers and it picks up from bookings from e-mail which is almost genius. | TripIt is a very useful web service I've been using for ages. It's nice to have it as a native iOS app but the app still has a long way to go before it's on par with the web UI. It gets better with each new update though! | Easy to use and keeps me always informed on my next trip, miles accounts and more, 
Thanks for this great app. | Really | Being on the road on a weekly basis I had to opt for one application that assists me with itineraries etc., but I have chosen an competitive product for one simple reason: the UI is so unattractive, actually even so unaspirational, that even after using the free version for couple of weeks, I made I decision to go to a different product, that offers exactly the same features, but in a very modern, attractive and smart user interface...

Potěšilo mě, že jsme se na ní při cestování MHD v Praze mohli absolutně spolehnout. Doporučuji všem kdo rádi využívají MHD | Moovit je super | super | Naprosto k ničemu. Drtivá většina CZ není absolutně pokryta a ta, která je, je už dávno pokryta ostatními aplikacemi a o dost kvalitněji | Celkem přehledná aplikace | Cannot set dep or arrival time, it instantly resets to current time. | Mohlo by tam být více auto k dopravců v České republice | Best app about traffic in Prague | Není co dodat. Funguje bezvadně | Verry helpful aplication. In Rome worked perfectly. displays the current location in real time, also the bus route | Dobry den,

Vase appka je temer dokonala. Chybi ji vsak funkcnost filtru. Kdyz nastavim, ze nechci metro, ale jen bus a tram, nabidka spoju to ignoruje a porad se objevuji spoje s metrem a tramvaj nikde.
Slo by to prosim opravit?

Petra | Too many soam recently, the worst thing is that appears at the middle of a search and complicates operating the app | 3x times advertisings 5 seconds each in 20 seconds… I missed my bus because of it😃

It is tooo much | Love the app! Is it possible to download it offline. I cannot see it in the app. Is it possible to purchase it as well? I am just tired of the ads. | Celkem fájn a zjednodušená aplikace pro neznalce v hromadný dopravě! | Aplikace naprosto výborná, super doma i na cestách v zahraničí. Škoda, že jsem ji neobjevila dříve. | I literally love this app! It's your wingman when you travelling abroad and you are not familiar with the city transport system. Save you lot of time and money.

Only thing that I would like to add is the indicator of direction in which your phone is pointing on the map, like its isn't made in Google Maps. | I just wish we had such a good app also where I live. I honestly can’t imagine trying to find directions without it. Only objection - stop names and last stop names could also be in English not only in Hebrew. But still, very thankful for this app. | Мои однозначные рекомендации! Много раз использовал данное приложение. Не подвело ни одного раза. Все работает четко, как часы! | Příjemná intuitivní APPka👍 | Aplikace je super, funguje dobře v Brně i Praze. | Vse funguje jak ma-rychla a transparentni informace | 14.12.21 nesouhlasi linka 153, jezdí jinak | Perfektní služba!!! | Excelente app , la mejor que utilicé hasta ahora !! Sería  bueno pagar para sacar la publicidad. Que es muy molesta y resta a esta aplicación!!! Sería bueno pagar | Great application ;-) 🤩👌 | Crashing and not working on both website and mobile app. | Úžasná aplikace | Supeeer | Spolehlivě najde všechny spoje - přehledná aplikace :) | Jeden den to ukáže, odjezd druhý den je nepodporovaná oblast. Základní logika chybí, nejspolehlivé, neaktuální. | U spojů MHD uvádí zcela jiné časy, než jsou ve skutečnosti. | Proč nejsou některé informace v Češtině? | Tahle Apka nemá chybu👍👍👍 | Super appka pri cestovani verejnou dopravou s aktualnimi informacemi | Alergit | I realy like this app, helps me a lot in my trips 🙂 | Super aplikace,něco takového mi chybělo. | I found this app very practical when abroad | Very useful in Lisbon, as it shows routes of the outliers which are included in the 40€ viva card pass. | In Italy - this is freaking helpful ! | You don’t need to know the name of the stop, just put the address you want to go to and the app finds the best way. | This apps helps you a lot in cities (where other apps and maps fail!) | Easy traveling | Safe your

CO VŠECHNO NAŠE MAPA UMÍ

• Více než 900 tipů na neokoukaná místa v Česku, která jsme pro vás osobně prozkoumali a vybrali
∙ Jednoduché vyhledávání podle kategorií (např. rozhledny, zříceniny, větrné mlýny, lomy apod.) a regionů
∙ Místa si můžete prohlížet na interaktivní mapě od Mapy.cz
∙ Nebo si je můžete procházet podle fotek
∙ Vaše oblíbená místa si můžete uložit do oblíbených
• Přidávejte si do navštívených místa, na kterých jste už byli
∙ Tipy na výlety s dětmi, kočárkem nebo psem
∙ Výlety pro vozíčkáře
∙ Informace o místech a vstupném
∙ Fotky od profesionálních českých fotografů
∙ Neustále vyrážíme na nová úžasná místa a přidáváme je do naší mapy a na náš Instagram

PROČ JSME MAPU VYTVOŘILI?

Za mapou úžasných míst stojím já (Krista) a moje mamka Eva. Společně vlastníme cestovatelskou komunitu Úžasná místa v Česku @uzasna.mista na Facebooku a Instagramu, kam přispíváme fotkami z našich výletů a z míst, která nám posílají naši fanoušci. 
Procestovaly jsme skoro 40 zemí světa, ale přesto jsme přesvědčené o tom, že u nás v Česku máme na malém území tolik úžasných míst, že můžeme leckteré turistické destinace hravě strčit do kapsy. 

Vybraly jsme pro vás s mámou více než 600 překrásných míst v Česku, která podle nás stojí za návštěvu. Velkou část z nich pravděpodobně nebudete znát, což byl náš záměr. Nechceme totiž posílat tisíce lidí jen na profláklá turistická místa, kde se to už teď hemží turisty. Našim cílem je dávat vám inspiraci na stovky neokoukaných míst a rozprostřít tak turismus po celé naší nádherné zemi. 

Doufáme, že si naší mapu a tipy na výlety užijete. 
Děkujeme moc za stažení!

Jen 2 připomínky : 1) pokud v “velenov” nic není, mohlo by vyhledávání ukázat nejbližší body 2) i při krátkém užívání se mi dost zahřívá mobil (i14Pro). Snad nějaká optimalizace? | Naprosto skvělá aplikace když chcete naplánovat nějaký výlet, ať krátký či dlouhý, ať pro dospělé či s dětmi. Doporučení nádherných mist, o kterých člověk nemá ani tušení. Dávám oprávněných 5 ⭐️😊 | Skvělá aplikace, přehledná a ta mapa míst okolo místa kde se nacházíte je naprosto super. Ale co bych ocenila tak více fotek k určitému místu, aby se člověk mohl rozhodnout, jestli tam chce jet a ne hledat fotky na netu, je to hrozná zdržovačka.. popřípadě uvedení kolik cca času návštěva místa zabere, občas plánujeme celodenní výlet a je těžké to rozvrhnout, nebo naopak chceme návštěvu na pár hodin, ale nemáme tušení kolik času to zabere a jak je to veliké. 
Jinak je to fajn vymoženost :) | Aplikace vypada dobre, jen se nezobrazuje mapa, co je skoda. Chce to ode mne zadat API klic? | Totálně zasekané prostředí, stále se buguje. Vše trvá a něco vůbec nefunguje. 

Při přibližování mapy zde zůstávají barevné kruhy s číslem i když už se místa, které se z nich mají rozbalit, dávno objevily. | Tahle appka má potenciál, zavede Vás na místa, která jsou i turisticky neprofláklá, ale není dobře zpracovaná, resp. není odladěná do svižnosti. Seká se, občas má po zoomování problém se zobrazením zájmových bodů a občas si klekne (spadne). 😄
Ale pomocník na cestování, v kombinaci s jinými, je to dobrý. Takže za 3. | Při běhu (mapa) brutálně zahřívá telefon (12mini). | Obsah je super. Jen aplikace by chtěla trochu víc pece a testování. Mapa se často zasedne a nepomůže nic jiného než aplikaci zabit. Odstranit tyhle bugy a super na 5 hvězdiček. S bugy to bohužel dost Kazi uživatelsky zážitek. | V jednoduchosti a přehlednosti je krása,za mne,super :-) | Vždyť to nic neumí. Nepovedlo se mi najít ani jediné město, které by to znalo. Kromě zcela náhodných tipů nejde nic najít cíleně, když se někam chystám a chci vědět, zda tam je něco k vidění. Někomu tohle funguje? | Super napad a dost informaci a moznost filtrace. Bohuzel appka je desne pomala, seka se, a to i po nekolika restartech | Začátek dobrý, šle žádný vývoj😟
V každém příspěvku je napsáno SLEDUJTE NÁŠ INSTYGRAM🤣
Proboha proč??? 
Ale ABY JSTE DALI WEBOVÉ STRÁNKY K JEDNOTLIVÝM MÍSTŮM, to už by asi bylo moc?! 
Stále chybí možnost vkládat vlastní fotky, hodnotit i s vlastním textem… 
Prostě klasický český “nedodělek”, práce napůl😢
VYMAZÁNO po roce a půl nečinnosti autora, jsou lepší! | Bozi apka! | Apka je přehledná, jednoduchá co se týká ovládání. Co se týká míst, tak vám vyhledá, co je ve vašem okolí nejblíže. Apka ne bez reklam, tak snad to tak zůstane, ikdyz chápu, ze kolikrát je potřeba vydělat na vývoj. Každopádně oceňuji snahu a odhodláni, tak snad vám to vydrží a nějaká další hezká místa přibudou. Jsem z okolí Prostějova, tak budu rad, když přidáte nějaké hezké místa i zde, klidně pošlu fotky i nějaký popis. To je asi vše a ještě jednou děkuji. | Tak to koukám jako blázen 🤗🤗🤗
To se povedlo. Moc gratuluju ke skvělé apce | Skvělá aplikace na výlety…venku je hezky, já mám čas, tak otevřu aplikaci a nabídne mi nejbližší místa a hnedka razím.. 
nemusím nikde nic složitě hledat 🙏🏻 | Skvělá apka na výlety a výběr lokací na focení. 
Bylo by skvělé mít více fotek ke každé lokaci a seskupování nejbližší míst. Například: Solenická podkova - Vrškamyk - Makova hora, Ještěd - Kryštofovo údolí.

Snad zůstane bez reklam | Skvělá aplikace. Myslím si, že by bylo dobré přidat funkci, aby lidé mohli přidávat do aplikace nějaká úžasná místa. | DOPORUČUJU | Ocenuji, ze si muzu mista zobrazit podle mapy i filtrovat, to mi na Instagramu chybelo. Nemluve o filtru, kam se da s kocarkem. 
Diky a drzim palce s dalsim vyvojem! 👌 | Bezva aplikace, děkuji! | V aplikaci je sice 600 míst, což může vypadat jako velké plus, ale jsou tam místa která jsou nezajímavá, nemají žádný popis a často tam jsou nic neříkající satelitní snímky z Googlu. To už si člověk může rovnou zadat “výlet” do mapy.cz a vyjde to nastejno.

Místa by se dle mého názoru měla hodně profiltrovat a smazat tyto nekvalitní příspěvky. 

Škoda. | Fantastické.Jednoduchá přehledná aplikace. Mnoho aplikací se o něco takového snažilo, ale vždy to bylo přeplácané a nepřehledné. 
Žádost o doplnění funkce vyhledáváni a možnost nahlášení památek. Např zámek Sychrov není uveden a to je škoda :-)) | Vzhledově je přehledná a stabilní. Líbí se mi styl zpracování. Dávám 5 ⭐️ myslím si, že oprávněně. | Přesně co potřebuju. Tipy na výlety po Čechách. Pěkně se dá filtrovat co chci najít i s navigací. Mám rád seznam mapy na těch se to ukazuje. Umí to navigovat, super. | Úžasná aplikace na plánování výletů. Rovnou i s mapkou😍 | Hrozny design, neprehledna mapa, ktera se divne loaduje a preskakuje, ve vetsine pripadu nekvalitni a rozmazany fotky (tesila jsem se na fotky of profi fotografu...). Pri prvnim nainstalovani se mi radi mista podle kategorie, takze mam vsude same mosty.. navic teda u nekterych mist chybi popis a cela appka mi prijde takova nedodelana. | 👍🏻 | Super appka pro všechny, kteří chtějí prozkoumat svoje okolí, nebo i zbytek ČR. Obsahuje rovnou i mapu, takze můžete hned vyrazit! | Skvělá aplikace, vše funguje jak má, vše krasne popsané, super 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 | Diky za insparaci na cesty!:) | Skvělá aplikace když hledáte inspiraci kam na výlet - vše přehledně na jednom místě.",4.43671,158,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/7a/e9/74/7ae97433-23b5-d365-6e97-575769cbd2e3/7060d237-ed2f-47c1-a5ac-54e8b685982a_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c7/7e/b7/c77eb788-77bf-910b-113f-dbb9726a2595/9f867340-4fd2-4abd-84b9-4f091a2a047f_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/68/61/fd/6861fd32-cbbd-6389-54dd-a02e2867edda/f2a7bc28-aee0-4b90-8625-55e007182ed8_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/b7/b5/95/b7b59502-e7b9-1697-d1aa-89fd13e45ffd/ea6138e6-1e48-4d64-b6cd-d90362c36bc0_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/9b/5f/9d/9b5f9dd0-6bd8-0328-71c1-9ddb94cb1dab/d2f68eed-1f96-4d6c-bd31-9b7ab83e44a9_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/d5/73/3d/d5733d5f-7a59-9e76-37cd-c3339a67f005/8750c81a-0a43-4852-98fd-d780584f9237_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/8a/4a/ec/8a4aecc0-4bdd-2295-f469-3737942e0272/8815b847-589b-4979-8354-92c16f22fce3_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_7.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/19/0c/f9/190cf9d4-0262-a903-00fd-57529169a947/a85b451c-9460-4634-b21f-91d19a948fc8_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/a0/9e/76/a09e7618-fc7f-23af-7e0e-1ce0cef2d85b/3f742d36-e32a-4f7c-863f-f8281763958d_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_9.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/6a/6d/ba/6a6dbab8-0ab4-8588-4848-9de2767ecaf5/1f24a113-16d1-4551-8dfa-58e3b0f72793_Copy_of_App_store_screenshots_10.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource113/v4/bd/0f/1b/bd0f1b6b-ee16-b3bc-0db5-c3c05067e67a/543a81f8-a8b1-4562-8af3-565cdde55d09_simulator_screenshot_1DDEDAE2-ABA7-4418-B1C0-375981C662C6.jpeg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/0f/83/d3/0f83d313-ea8b-1857-bdbb-317bd21f2234/0db994fa-1b3a-45ef-96d1-6298eee668d8_simulator_screenshot_0352C27F-1492-40CE-8685-15F74D8BA037.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource123/v4/c7/c1/9f/c7c19f47-8fec-f5e0-be68-121301434de3/bddc540c-3736-4b61-9bb2-389139398809_simulator_screenshot_773B1097-6FEF-449F-B168-67F8BACFFEAB.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPad2Wifi-iPad2Wifi"",""iPad23G-iPad23G"",""iPhone4S-iPhone4S"",""iPadThirdGen-iPadThirdGen"",""iPadThirdGen4G-iPadThirdGen4G"",""iPhone5-iPhone5"",""iPodTouchFifthGen-iPodTouchFifthGen"",""iPadFourthGen-iPadFourthGen"",""iPadFourthGen4G-iPadFourthGen4G"",""iPadMini-iPadMini"",""iPadMini4G-iPadMini4G"",""iPhone5c-iPhone5c"",""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPho

In short - just Norway, simply💙🤍❤️👌🌹🍀💋 | Just rubbish whole hotels.com is really crap service | Some data is not replicated from the online system to the mobile app | This app is wors than the old one. Many times it doesn’t open even though I have bookings done through the app and bookings is not pissinle to add into the app wallet as it was before. 
Furthermoremy country and currency dissapeared from the app.
This is not a problem of my phone which I just changed. Had same issues on the old one. | As a frequent business traveler I wanted to switch from booking competition but it was a huge mistake. Never seen worse written app which has so many bugs, underpaid and totally incompetent support somewhere from S. Asia. Portfolio in listing is a fraction and also missing availability what competitors actually have and offers. Guess why. They give to accommodations only 70-80% what you pay.

BTW once a time they pay to delete honest reviews. So I am saving this and once a time I repost it. | Not Good after changes :-/ | Newly not possible to have my company address on hotel invoice. Therefore hotels.com is not useable for business travel anymore | You can’t have a country/language/currency as you want. You put UK and have pounds, you out Italy and. English language, but it’s all in Italian..nightmare | I stopped use Hotels.com forever. After you Change App, change Language, change currency and support. Everyone go to Booking or others. Worst change ever and worst management in world. Soon you will bankrupcy because of that! | Not able to sign in often, not easy to change bookings. | Well… login doesnt work | Application is crap. If you are booking, they select for you next month as current day!!! Never saw any app like this!! If you want change or cancel, they dont allow you to, so you have lost your money. Just scam!! Never more! | The newly redesigned app is dosaster. Its not anymore easy to use app. Its better to go to webpage now instead to app. This will most probably take me to Booking.com.
Also missing the availability to out booking into wallet like in past. | Sorry to say that, but it’s a nightmare to use this app after the big update. There are so many random crashes and errors and there are no signs of improvement after several months. | Po aktualizaci není možné dát češtinu | Slow and crashing often, not able to pick correct currency. ROE? Really? Not all EU countries use euro… | Always when is app open occurred info something went wrong…not good, not useful. | Stará byla mnohem lepší | The update is a step back. Very bad one. I really enjoyed the old version and I’ve been using it a lot. Now I don’t understand why the only available app language is English. Why I can’t adjust all the invoice/receipt information anymore. I love things that works, this updated app is not one of them… | now it is impossible to change currency- It shows EURO - I cannot change it. My country is now - Rest of Europe ( Czech )- and language is only - english ( irland ) - I cannot change this..  
WHY ?????
Very bad update !!!! Very unhappy ;-((( | Po aktualizaci nelze vybrat region Česká republiky ,tudíž nelze následně vybrat CZK. | App works great; the offer of hotels is wide; you find a nice deals here - economy as well as business. I do recommend and wish you a nice quick booking & long good sleep in your hotel! Enjoy Ondrej | Aplikace je přehledná. Ubytování výhodné. Ale malý výběr v určitých městech.
Občas se sekne, občas se nedá vrátit zpět a bohužel mi nefunguje označování ""oblíbené"" (označím ubytování srdíčkem, vyjedu z něj a kouknu do oblíbených, ale ubytování tam není). | App very slow and favorites selection doesn’t work , fix it please | Iphone:
Does not work send a messege ( to Hotel) | Při bookingu se odhlásí a nepřipočítá známky !!! | The only issue is the UI. I had to switch to “the rest of Europe” location to make the app keep € as the default currency. Otherwise it kept switching to my country’s currency every time I opened the app. | Imposible to login or register. Screen is empty. | Pro newbie super dojem, ale kdo se nejdřív nespáli a nepoučí,  tak  prodělá. Láká na “10 dni rewards” ale, i když se nevratně platí předem(můj případ), noci se přičtou až když jste doma. Objednal sem si komplet pobyt, o den méně, abych využil odměnu pro hotel na letišti. Takže smolik. Takže pro mě obrovské zklamání. Dejte si pozor a nebere věci logicky. V podmínkách to zřejmě mají | I cannot easily resolve the problem with the hotel via this application. | Easy to use, always working and great support! | This application is very bad | Neodpovídá na písemné reklamace. Nechá vás dojet do hotelu který jste si rezervoval a při tom hotel je zavřený, nefunkční. (Miami Florida USA) | I was just trying to book hotel in app and it doesn’t allow it. It always want to enter security code for credit card and after pressing booking, it again asks for security code. After doing it for 5 times I went do web site and book it there. | Dlouhodobě využívám aplikaci Hotels.com nejen z důvodu věrnostního programu, ale i pro širokou nabídku ubytování. | I recently booked an apt hotel and the final price was more than double what was quoted, rep said due to fees and taxes ... went from 86 usd to 175 usd per night, not a nice surprise. Then when I callled in they told me it is due to extra people although I entered the correct number of people from the outset when I got the quote. Not good. | Chybi nastaveni filtru jako ma booking. Chybi kontaktni telefon na ceskeho operatora. Chybi email !!!! Kreditni karta neslouzi jako zaruka !!! Okamzite strhavate penize z uctu. !!! Strhnete castku a na hotelu jsem dostal slevu, o kterou jste me pripravili vasim systemem !!! | Bad app as the whole hotels is ridiculously disaster. No way - you don't know how to behave to customer, you can't solve anything and produce only spam. Deleting this crap. | Výborná alternativa k porovnání s např. Booking.com.

Be prepared for rain, snow, storm, hurricane, or any other severe weather conditions. Monitor the weather radar map and check the forecast - all in one app.

RainViewer gives you access to all the essential tools needed to stay aware of the weather. This includes hyperlocal forecasts, a down-to-the-minute rain chart, weather alerts, a radar map, and widgets.

WEATHER RADAR MAP

Watch the animation to see the storm’s intensity and its path in the past, present, and future. This will give you a quick heads-up of what to expect in your area.

GLOBAL RAIN&SNOW

No radar coverage? No problem! Our ""Global Rain&Snow"" map layer shows real-time, satellite-based precipitation data for radar-free zones, such as oceans or deserts. Stay informed about rain and snow patterns on the map and receive alerts no matter where you are.

FORECAST

Get the most important weather information with hourly and daily forecasts that help you plan your days better. Check the minute-by-minute rain forecast when it starts to rain, so you'll know when the rain stops and avoid getting wet.

WEATHER ALERTS

Get notified when the rain starts and ends with our precise Rain Alerts. Additionally, RainViewer provides you with crucial tools for your safety - severe weather alerts to notify you of upcoming critical weather conditions. Set up alerts and stay ahead of the weather.

WIDGETS

Small things can make your life easier, like widgets. Set them up to get quick weather updates without even unlocking your phone. Stay informed and be prepared for any weather, right from your lock or home screen.

LIVE ACTIVITY

Quickly check the weather with RainViewer’s Live Activity. It shows a minute-by-minute precipitation forecast, rain intensity, and the time left until the end of the rain.

STORM DIRECTION ARROWS

The storm direction arrows on the map show the exact direction and path of the storm's precipitation. This in-app feature can help you better understand the storm movement and plan accordingly.

DATA PRIVACY

We value your privacy. RainViewer doesn't personify or sell user data. With your geolocation, we enhance weather features like real-time location updates, precise forecasts, and alerts.

The RainViewer app is the ultimate weather tool, precise and reliable. But there's more, our in-app features take it to the next level:

• Precipitation arrows on the radar map
• Radar animation forecasts for the next 2 hours
• Extended daily and hourly forecasts
• 48-hour map archives
• Weather tracking in up to 20 locations

Díky | Díky této apce na častých služebních cestách vím kde se dobře najíst. | Konečně něco, co nám pořadí, kde se najíst. ❤️ | Stále píše, že se vyskytla chyba, a že nejde internet. | Napomocna appka na rychle najdenie restiky v okoli👍 az na to “darovanie” 99kc, ktore je tak zjednodusene, ze sa mi to uz parkrat podarilo nedobrovolne, az na tolko si appku necenim 🤷🏻‍♀️ | Bezvadna pomoc pri hledani dobreho podniku! Libilo by se mi kdybych si mohla (jako v knize) psat k podnikum svoje zazitky, poznamky a pripominky. Ne verejne jen pro sebe :) ale jinak diky, jste bezva! | Rádi jíme a dost cestujeme. Aplikace nám zpříjemňuje cesty a dělá nám dobře na duši i v žaludku :-). Vždyť je to přeci známá věc, že tyto světy jsou přeci vzájemně propojené. Moc Vám děkujeme Lukáši, zatím ani jedinné zklamání, ani nenaplněné očekávání ;-). | Čekal jsem sofistikovanou aplikaci s přesným hodnocením - místo toho se dočkáte u každého místa jen plytkého, nicneříkajícího, textu, bez konkrétního hodnocení, cenového rozpětí, atd. | Moc jsem se těšila na tuhle aplikaci a opravdu nezklamala 👌🏻 super design a přehlednost. Za mě nutnost na výlety. Jen tak dál! 👍🏻 | Apka funguje skvele a vrele doporucuju | Slušný lidi se slušnou aplikací 👍 - pokračujte v dalších tipech 😉 , díky . | Zažil jsem už poměrně hodně platforem založené na doporučení místních podniků, možnost nahlédnout pod pokličku, dočíst se recenze a i toto hodnotím velice kladně. Přehledné, jednoduché, valná většina doporučených míst je přesně má krevní skupina a nezbývá nic jiného, než tuto skvělou věc podpořit. | Upřímně si myslím ze někdo z vybraných restauraci má slušnou provizi. Vecina restauraci v mem kraji nemá zrovna slušnou pověst a naopak ty narvane k prasknutí zde není ani jedna. :( | Jsem moc rád, že vznikla tato aplikace! Díky Lukášovi Hejlíkovi a jeho Gastromapě! | Perfektně udělaná aplikace. Pokud se chcete dobře najíst i mimo Prahu, tak je to nezbytnost. | Panebože tak dobrou appku jsem dlouho neviděla. Jednoduchá, přehledná a nádherně zpracovaná. Doporučuji! ❤️ | Kamkoliv jedeme,necháme si rádi od Lukáše a jeho Gastromapy poradit. Ani jednou jsme nelitovali! ❤️ | Normální souhrnný přehled výborných/lepších/průměrných podniků, který Vám dá s přehledem Google. To, že to navštívil někdo jednou s nějakým jménem, nic neznamená. Zadarmo drahé na tahání peněz z lidí... | Je super mit v kapse neco podobneho, jen bych ocenil v aplikaci i propojeni s google maps a samozrejme rozhled na mape..treba v pristi verzi! :-) | Třikrát hurá! Na gastroAppku jsem dlouho cekala a je to tady♥️ Podle tipů manželů Hejlíkových jsme našli uz nejeden poklad🍝 Diky za to a preji mnoho dalsich uspesnych tipů, jste skveli!!!! | Gastromapu sledujeme od pocatku a na cestach po republice nam neskutecne pomaha. To vyhledavani (dopredu!!! 😡) pres web bylo ale tak neprakticke
Diky app lze konecne vyuzit ad hoc jak je potreba v miste vyletu; supeeeeeeer diky!!!! | Z appky jsem nadšená. Je krásná, přehledná, baví mě! Jen bych ještě ocenila něco na označení podniků, které jsem navštívila. 
Ale dávám palec hore! Jíst mě teď baví ještě o něco víc. | Pecka, jsem spokojen 🙂 | Doporučuji, úžasná věc... Pro všechny, co chtějí dobře jíst a pít a mají rádi hezké podniky je gastromapa ten nejlepší průvodce. | Velmi dobre udělané. Jednoduché, přehledné, umí to přesně to co má. Komfort pro uživatele oproti webu se podstatně zvýšil. | Super aplikace🔝 Konečně všechny podniky na jednom místě s mapou, recenzí od Lukáše a obrázky.

Aplikace z ničeho nic přestala fungovat. Otevře se a hned spadne :-(
Nepomohl restart telefonu. Ani odebrani a nova instalace app.

Super aplikace. Krasne si mohu predem vybrat benzinku na trase podle ceny 👍 Je zajimave jak cenu benzinu u pumpy co mam pred barakem a vidim na jeji cenik zadava nekdo pomalu kazdou hodinu. A druhou mene oblibenou benzinku co mam za domem a na cenik nevidim zada nekdo jednou za nekolik tydnu ;-) Diky vsem co pomahaji, take pro vas zadavam ceny. | iPhone 13 Pro, iOS 17.2.1. - aplikace spadne hned po spusteni. | Zničeho nic začala při aktualizaci cen padat. Dosud jsem byl maximálně spokojen. Nevím, jestli vývojář na appce ještě pracuje, ale byla by škoda, kdyby se na ni vykašlal. | . | iPhone 13 pro | aplikace při aktualizaci cen padá… a vzhledem k datu posledního updatu to bohužel vypadá, že autory už ta aplikace nezajímá | Na 13 mini po aktualizaci na  17.2.1 po otevreni ihned spadne. Udelejte opravu pls... diky | Ale je to závislé na aktivní komunitě. Bohužel co jsem dnes koukal tak ceny byly i 7 měsíců staré. | Je to výborná aplikace, ale po posledních updatech ios trvá její spuštění asi 30 s, což nebývalo.
Snad se pracuje na upgradu. | Nejdou odstranit již neprodávaná paliva. Cena ADblue má malý rozsah. Někde je tak nízká cena,že nejde zadat její aktualizace. | Velmi často využívám tuto aplikaci a na svých oblíbených benzinkách aktualizuji ceny. Jen by to ještě chtělo zapracovat na dark modu. | nenajde polohu – nenajde ani pumpu | Ceny jsou několik dní staré neodpovídají skutečnosti :-( | nepouzitelne | Ačkoli lze ručně aktualizovat ceny paliva, nelze ceny aktualizovat přes pevně danou hranici - v případě kdy je cena vyšší. V podstatě je to aplikace k ničemu - ceny staré i několik měsíců - ceny zapisují samotní uživatelé. Je lepší volit jinou aplikaci. | Momentálně zavřeno-rekonstrukce | Ceny v aplikaci vůbec neodpovídají skutečnosti. Nestalo se to jednou!! | Dnes 7. Května 2022, měla být dle aplikace cena nafty u čerpací stanice Bílý a syn v Brně v Bohunicích naproti Kauflandu za 43,90,-/l ale je za 45,90,- a to i když mám nastavenou aktualizaci každou hodinu.
K ničemu NEDOPORUČUJI !!! | Občas to bohužel ukazuje ceny před 20ti lety
Viz dnes 15.4. 2022 
Benzina Plzeň Univerzitní nafta za 23,- | Ceny nejsou úplně aktuální jinak ale super app | I kdyz jsem sám aktualizoval dvakrát za den, vratily se na cenu o 5kč vyssi | Aplikace poskytuje nepravdivé informace u čerpacích stanic Tank Ono , Shell , OMW , ztráta času a kilometrů za levným benzínem který je pak drahý . | chtělo by to dark mode. :(( | Zatím funguje dobře, bylo by to i na 5 hvězd, ale není zde dark mode. | Jak se mohu má tuto aplikaci  spolehnout když dává špatně ceny paliv ? 
Něco stim udělejte | No jako trosku ty ceny nesedí, třeba aktuálně na stanici ONO 39.60 a když tam přijedeš tak 41.90 | Velmi jednoduchá a přehledná app, bohužel naprosto žádná aktualizace a nepřesné ceny. | Bylo by super, kdyby byla posunuta hranice maximální ceny. Při dnešních cenách je hranice nízká. V zahraničí přispůsobit rozsah cen konkrétní měně v tom státě!!!! | To není problem vývojářů ale nechápu který blbci davaj fakovy nízký ceny. Napr omv Švehlova Praha. Provozovatel? Pak to je nízké. | Ceny nejsou aktuální a nedají se aktualizovat. Aplikace je totálně nespolehlivá.Hledal jsem náhradu ale žádnou jsem nenašel. | Funguje, přehledné a intuitivní. | Uzitečná aplikace pro komunitu řidičů.
Rozšiřte prosím horní mez pro cenu ""Ad-Blue"". Hodnota 29 Kč/l už není bohužel dostatečná ☹️ Díky. | Hodně starých dat | Zajímavá aplikace, ale ocenil bych přímo ve filtrování diesel bez biosložky. | Night mode seems to be a fail... not a readable font... | Zpočátku dobrý, dokud nezačali lidi přidávat fake ceny. | Aplikace je designově celkem zastaralá, což je vidět i na ikonce aplikace, která je z velmi starých guidlines iOS. Jinak je aplikace plně funkční a nikdy s ní nebyl žádný problém, ani po letech nemám důvod měnit za jinou. | Stojím na benzince, kde je nafta za 24,90, ale appka ukazuje 26,40. Celkem k ničemu tedy... | Aplikace neukazuje vubec nic. 
Zadne pumpy nezobrazuje | Super aplikace konečně 👏 | Maji dane limity o kolik jde snizit castka ted treba nejde nastavit cena pod 24 ikdyz pumpa tu cenu ma | Ostrava | Aplikace sama o sobe naprosta pecka super napad super ovladani ale na prd je to ze uz to hold nema moc uzivatelu a nektere ceny nejsou aktualizovane treba i 3 mesice. Je to skoda.... | Výborná aplikace | appka nejde ani spustit | Používám zatím krátce, silně se však přimlouvám za možnost označit více preferovaných paliv. V praxi, když hledám nejbližší pumpu, je mi napr. jedno, jestli mají 98+ nebo Verva 100.  Toto je pro mě u jinak velmi dobre aplikace zásadní nedostatek. | Funguje pěkně.

A to jsem zaprisahlej fanda vlastni dopravy autem! 👍🏻 | Aplikaci s tolika chybami a tak arogantním vystupováním jejich zástupců na sociálních sítích by člověk těžko pohledal. Ostuda hlavního města. | Neumí ani hledat trasy. Např. Opatov - Čestlice, Nákupní zóna Logika aktivace je nepřehledná, chaotická
Neumí zobrazit detail trasy vlaku - již vyhledaná trasa zobrazí mapu světa. 

A mraky podobných nesmyslů… jak testujete? | Aplikace je plna bugu. Napr pri platbe.
Zakaznicka podpora je otřesná a nezdvořilá | už by to chtělo integraci QR kódu do Apple wallet, nebo alespoň widget na lock screen, dost by to zrychlilo kontrolu | Tlačítko “Koupit kupón. Zakrývá to informace o zaplacených pásmách. Na iphone 13 maxpro je QR kód moc velký a nečtou ho čtečky v příměstských autobusech. | by to po těch letech vážně chtělo.

A způsob ukončení účtu přes vygenerování e-mail zprávy mě nepřijde jako úplně vhodný. Notabene když na webu takováto volba ve správě účtu není. | Aplikace neumí pracovat s modrými/fialovými zóny co jsou o víkendu zadarmo a chce účtovat peníze za každou hodinu jako ve všední den. Pozor na to | Useless government lobbied unprofessional app | Kazdej druhej nakup mi vyhodi chybu a kdyz pak zkontroluju jizdenky tak jich mam 10. Co je opravdu mimoradne retardovany je, ze musim jizdenku “aktivovat” a cekat dve minuty. Takze kdyz prijede MHD driv nebo pozdeji tak jsem v prdeli. Kdyz aktivuju prilis brzo tak se pripravim o platnost jizdenky a kdyz moc pozde tak od revizoru dostanu pokutu protoze mi zbejva 10 vterin do aktivace. Uplne napoprve jsem nevedel, ze si jizdenku musim aktivovat, smysl to samo o sobe moc nedava a aplikace na to samozrejme neupozorni. Pak prisel hodny pan revizor a vysvetlil mi to, za 1000 korun. Kterej imbecil tohle vymyslel? | Nefunguje placeni parkovani, porad to hlasi chybu. | Spojení nejde uložit do kalendáře, chybí notifikace na odjezd spoje / kdy vyrazit na zastávku | Apple pay doesn't work. I can't pay for parking in the blue zones. | Absolutelly horrible. Took my money when i bought the yearly pass. Didnt even give the pass nor did it return the money. Scam | Aplikace je sama o sobě dobrá, vyvíjí se, nabízí a integruje další možnosti jako parkování,…
Ale pohřbívá ji aktivace, která trvá 2 minuty a revizoři DPP neakceptují ani vteřinu pod aktivační dobu. Tím zas pro jízdenky ztratí smysl-když je jízdenka evidentně aktivovaná několik deíteknsekund, typicky, když jenautovud na dohled a stejně je vlastně neplatná.
Bohužel… | Aplikace je super a už mi zjednodušuje život nějakou dobu. Nejlepší je že se stále vyvíjí a je to na ni vidět.

Jen prosím: Bylo by možné na malých zařízeních využít celou šířku telefonu a roztáhnout QR kód jízdenky aby kolem nebyl zbytečný prostor? Mám iPhone 13 mini a kvůli velikosti QR kódu docela často zdržuji frontu na nástup do autobusu, protože jej čtečka nechce hned přečíst. | Používám ji asi 3 měsíce a myslím si, že funguje skvěle. Jediné co mě zaskočilo, je ta dvouminutová prodleva při aktivaci jízdenky. Mám roční kupón a teprve nedávno jsem potřeboval jízdenku na zóny, které nemám zaplacené. Aktivoval jsem ji před nástupem do autobusu a najednou zjistil, že je tam ta prodleva. Naštěstí byl řidič shovívavý (meziměstský spoj s nástupem pouze předními dveřmi). | Nedávno zmizely z aplikace vyjezdove a zatahujici tramvajové spoje, Respektive se ukazují pouze v trase kde jedou po trase linky. | Užitečná aplikace pro jednorázové i opakované nákupy jízdenek. V kombinaci s ApplePay je to super. | Další příklad zpackaného pokusu o digitalizaci. Na zastávce, kde autobusy jezdí plus mínus 10 a víc minut mimo jízdní řád, jsem si aktivoval jízdenku v momentě, kdy jsem autobus viděl přijíždět. Následně jsem musel nastoupit ještě před plarností a hned u dveří mě legitimoval revizor, kupón někde uprostřed 2min karenční doby. Přestože věděl, že byl kupón aktivován už venku, uložil pokutu a reklamační odd. dpp ji potvrdilo. I když nejspíš mají info, kdy autpbus zastavil a že byl kupón již aktivní. Tohle prosím hoďte do kanálu. A mně nezbývá, než přesednout do auta, protože tohle jako zákazník odmítám akceptovat. | I had a problém after buying 24h ticket for 13 zones. That there is very small text, that it is not applicable in Prague. Although it was in chart Prague+other zones. I know  it is my mistake, that I missed it. But the warning should be bigger or there should be written all zones, where it is aplicable. | Funguje celkem dobře, ale při psaní stanice/zastávky se aplikace celkem seká. A klepnutí na šipky (prohození stanic) reaguje jak se tomu zachce. | This app allows you to buy tickets and then activate them in the app. However, after pressing activate button it takes 2 minutes before the ticket becomes valid and the app does not inform about it. People are getting fined for this. It’s better to buy paper tickets. | Missing an option to remove unused identifiers. Why would you need to keep information of my old expired debit card or an old phone. 

The blinding feature on tickets tab could be optional… | When there is a few days left user is notified. If you decide to buy another pass, its overlapping for a few days instead of starting after the previous one ends. This is very fraud-like user experience. Well done PID. | Nejde stáhnout do Apple Watch nebo do Apple Wallet. | Pro vyhledání všeho ohledně spojů MHD v Praze výborné. Pro nákup jízdenek funguje sice bez problémů, ale po nákupu nesmíte zapomenout aktivovat 2 min před nástupem do tramvaje, anebo koupit jízdenku na konkrétní spoj, opět 2 min předem, ale už bez nutné aktivace 2 min předem.
Pro parkování radši využijte CityMove, vývojářům PID doporučuji na tuto apku kouknout. PID má totiž problém s kartama, placením, nedostatečně informuje o tom kolik času vám zbývá a ani neupozorní na konec parkování...někdy si myslíte, že vše proběhlo, ale chyba lávky.... | This App is the best (and official!) for travelling around Prague. You can use Apple Pay and they are not charging any hidden fees like some other apps (yes EasyPark I'm talking about you!). This app is the best for parking in Prague as well. Please don't use any other unofficial apps because they steal money with their nonsense extra fees (for example easypark). Also it looks like EasyPark is paying bots to make fake bad reviews for PID, so be aware! | I primarily use this app for my annual ticket, aiming to demonstrate its validity. Unfortunately, I faced challenges as the app unexpectedly logged me out.
The login experience was suboptimal, especially considering the prevalence of password managers. It was inconvenient not being able to paste the password, particularly when needing to quickly access my ticket. 
I wonder if there's a necessity to log users out of the app. If so, perhaps notifying users via email could help, as some may not check the app frequently. | Po posledním updatu nejde ani otevřít. | V aplikaci mi to při každém pokusu přidání fotky sníží kvalitu a tím pádem mi ji to neschváli. Další věc je, že při pokusu o změnu identifikátoru se to sice tváří že došlo ke změně, ale ve finále nedošlo a kvůli tomu jsem dostala pokutu od revizora. Prý nejsem první u koho toto chování viděl. | How do I buy ticket for kid?
How/where do I apply discount for kid with isic?
Why so complicated? | Nelze zakoupit jízdenku, platba neproběhne. | Kdykoli cestuji do Prahy, tak aplikace vždy slouží jak má. Naprostá spokojenost. | Appka na iOS neukládá state restoration. Když jsem na detailu spojení a nechám na pozatí, vrátím se do appky a dám aktualizovat zpoždění appka spadne nebo se vrátí domů když nespadne.

Další co bych očekával se swipe na další/přechozí spoj v detailu spoje ne jen na listingu spojů.

Ještě bych rád viděl na mapě trasu spoje celou, nejen co jedu já.

Díky jinak supr appka! | Nepřišla notifikace o konci platnosti kupónu. Dlužíte mi 1000. | Just came into the tram, activated the ticket right next to the ticket machine upon entering the tram. Then the person that checks the tickets came by and asked me for my ticket, and he could see that the ticket was activated beforehand but had 1 minute left on the activation clock. Nevertheless, I got fined 1000 CZK for having an invalid ticket. Absolute nonsense!!! What’s the point of the app if you cannot use it??? Absolute nonsense. | Na iPhone SE 2020 se nedá koupit (prodloužit roční kupon). Na iPhone 13 to jde, takže předpokládám, ze to aplikace nezvládá na tomto starším kousku. (Telefon má aktuální iOS i aplikaci a byl zrestartován). | I have there my all year coupon. The purchase of other tickets is also easy. Perfect that apple pay works nicely.
But what I really miss is a no app for apple watch. | When i tried to buy 30day praha subsc, the app didn’t let me to do this and gave me error. And for the second time it won’t buyed too and then i realized that app took my money from my bank account 2times and after 3-4 min it started showing i have 2 absolutely identical subscriptions. 

I lost my money because of this, u just need to fix it or it’d be considered as scam. | Na příměstských linkách pravidelně nejde načíst QR kód jízdenky zobrazený aplikací na iPhonu. Nakupování jízdenek v aplikaci pak nemá cenu, jejich kontrola při nástupu pak zdržuje ostatní cestující. Zajímavé je že s ostatními aplikacemi podobného typu (ČD můj vlak, Arriva, atd.) toto funguje mnohem spolehlivěji. | Opět nechodí notifikace z parkování…. | App worked, but produced many errors. Got blocked due to many login attempts. I haven't tried to log in once! | Inovace ve vyhledavani spojeni (aktualni poloha) je velice spatne a nejde vypnout. | Aplikace nenajde trasu a zobrazí informaci o neexistujícím spojení, i když na webu DPP spoj v pohodě dohledat jde (pondělí odpoledne, trasa Pankrác - Flora). A stále chybí darkmode… | Pěkně zpracovaná a bezvadně fungující aplikace. Jízdenku si koupím už doma, parkování na místě a vše jde platit Apple Pay. Super!
Návrh na zlepšení: upravit aplikaci pro Carplay, aby se parkování dalo platit z displaye auta | Nelogické, když během 2-3 sekund přijde od banky potvrzení o provedení transakce.

- app works as intended 
- live activities implemented, great way to inform passenger about the trip 

Ugly:
- live activities rely on just a timer, not a gps info from the bus. There’s no way to check current position of a bus/train
- no actual gps data means that automatic delay refunds also don’t work - my bus was delayed 70 min, but system declares only 20
- UX in paying is complicated for a senior buyer - you have to choose Apple Pay twice, in a second step through a web page (unnecessarily) with a tiny unreadable font | Kam zmizela apple pay platba?? Driv jsem klikla a zaplatila a po dnesni aktualizaci tam je jen moznost nejakeho ""rychleho"" prevodu, ktery trva asi pet minut a skacete jak idioti ze stranky na stranku, do mobilni banky neco povolit pak zase prekliknout no NESMYSL!!! | Přetíženost
A párování kreditních jízdenek s mobilním číslem nebo e-mailem .
Uz mám 5 kreditních jízdenek a 966 normálních jízdenek | Dost problematická appka, která je velmi často přetížená a pokud si bude chtít aktualizovat stav, kdy je možné si objednat, tak vám může úplně zmizet vaše jízdenka (která byla zakoupena přes app), poté jsem musela jízdenku vyhledat přes email a přihlásit se pomocí čísla. Velmi nepříjemná chvíle nejistoty. 
Bohužel mám takovou nepozitivní zkušenost i z používání v minulosti (nemožnost objednat ani zaplatit jídlo). Také se vám asi bohužel stane, že bude appka přetížená a budete muset počkat. Ono je to vždycky šokující, když vaše on-line služby chce najednou využívat více lidí. Kdo by to čekal...(""sarkasmus""). 
Pro objednání jídla, je ale nutná, takže musíme jen doufat, že si její vývojáři budou chtít toto renomé napravit. | Často nefunguje, padá,.. člověk tak nemůže objednat nebo zrušit jízdenku | Ani přes opakované pokusy nejde v nové verzi (od 29.2.24) na iPadu zaplatit kartou. V předchozí verzi to fungovalo normálně. | Aplikace neustále padá, automaticky se sama odhlašuje, není schopná vyhledat jízdenky (píše, že momentálně probíhá velké množství vyhledávání).
Člověk by čekal, že aplikace, která má umožnit vyhledání a koupi jízdenek, bude schopna svoji hlavní a jedinou důležitou funkci umožnit. Bohužel velmi často nefunguje, jak by měla. | Nejde objednat a zaplatit jídlo ve voze Astra i české dráhy mají lepší možnosti zakoupení jídla | Love RegioJet, but this app sometimes does not work. | Конченное приложение, каждые 15 минут лагает. Невозможно нормально купить билет. Если бы можно было поставь 0 звёзд я бы поставил | Ten system je jeden velkej joke, neustále tam neco nefunguje. Pokud se vam změní plany a potrebujete stornovat listek (nejpozdeji 15m pred odjezdem vlaku) muze to klidne dopadnout tak, ze budete 30m klikat na storno a porad to bude hazet nejaky error. To same s nákupem listku. Misto přechodu v košíku na zaplacení (klik na tlačítko zaplatit) mi to naházelo do košíku dalsich 6 listku. Pro jejich odstraňování se neco 5m nacita a nic to nedela. Nepomáhá restart aplikace nic. Nevim jestli jejich server nezvládá nápor uživatelů nebo kde je problem, ale na vlakovou aplikaci, kde je nekdy potreba reagovat rychle z duvodu měnících se planu, je tohle totalni katastrofa. I Ceske drahy tu digitalizaci zvladaji lepe. Je to smutne, protoze Regiojet vstoupil na trh jako alternativa k tehdy jedinému dopravci s tim, ze ukáže, jak by mely vypadat dopravní vlakové sluzby 21. stoleti a stačilo par let a jsou na tom snad jeste hůř nez CD. 
Pokud mate moznost sednout do auta a jet si listek koupit osobne na nadrazi cca do 20min, bude to rychlejší varianta, nez pres aplikaci. | Několikrát jsem se při snaze koupit a používat aplikaci tolik naštvala, že jsem radši jela s jinou společností. 
Často se objevuje error, údajně kvůli zvýšenému momentálnímu vytížení, i uprostřed noci. Neustále nefunguje rezervování sedadla a poté zničehonic mám deset rezervací. Opakovaně problém s platbou, měla jsem mít koupenou jízdenku, platba se odečetla, ale pouze přičetla do peněženky. Takže jsem vinou aplikace musela kupovat jízdenku znovu přímo ve vlaku a s přirážkou. 
To, že se mi v průběhu hledání jen tak odhlásí účet a musím se přihlásit znovu, nebo že si aplikace nepamatuje jaký tarif volím a neustále mě zdržuje zaškrtáváním toho správného už beru jako detail. | Absolutně odporná a věčně přetížená aplukace. 3 hodiny mi hlásí, že je přetížená a nedá se používat a pak se všechny lístky vyprodají. 3x jsem musel na pobočku řešit lístek, který mi aplikace zrušila, ale nevrátila peníze. Úplně dementní systém účtů. Kdyby šlo dát nula hvězd tak dávám. | Co s tou appkou je? Nemůžu si koupit jizdenku, proces se zastavi v košíku a dal mě to nepustí. O tom, ze mě to už aspoň 10x odhlásila ani nemluvim. No dnes fakt tragické. Nejhorší je, ze na webu to není o nic lepší. | Being unable to order food because it's possible only for 60+ min. rides and yours is 58 min. just doesn't feel good. | Kdykoli má člověk potřebu aplikaci použít, aplikace zaznamenává větší počet vyhledávání, tedy nefunguje. | Aplikace neustále padá, po objednání z palubního servisu se aplikace sekne/spadne, bez upozornění, co se stalo s vašimi penězi a jestli vám někdo přinese vámi objednané a zaplacené jídlo. A jako třešnička na dortu neochotná drzá obsluha, která se s vámi problém nesnaží vyřešit, ale dělá z vás debila. | The app is just terrible, the loading time is crazy and ticket system is confusing. | Ztratil jsem zabazadlo. A druhý den jsem ho měl zpátky. Skvělá služba! Moc doporučuji. | strašný | Pravidelně se nezobrazují informace o zpoždění vlaků, člověk pak nestihne zrušit jízdenku, nebo koupit jinou a je nucen čekat ! | Tohle je strasny. Proc delat veci lehce. Kdyz se muzou delat tezce 😏 | Give me some basic filters, like “direct bus” please!!!!! potřebujeme filtr jako “přímé spojení” . Bugs in displaying free seats (only shows the lower decker) 2024 January | Zlaté ČD a Leoexpress. Mohli byste se inspirovat, jak na aplikaci a platby. Vlastně téměř už ve všem. Jízda jak v dobytčáku. | Vysoké riziko, že nedokážete stihnout vrátit lístek v případě potřeby protože se aplikace rozhodne zrovna samovolně odhlasit při spuštění. | Tato aplikace upadá na kvalitě každým měsícem, trochu jako vlakové spoje  regiojetu. Rok, dva a budeme na úrovni českých drah. | When there is an exceptional event that stop the traffic on the rail and I need to take a replacement bus at my train station, I expect to receive notification from the app. This is not the case. The details of the impacted train are even updated 👎 Useless | Meli by se vratit ke staremu, dobremu, klasickemu obchazeni cestujicich co s tyce objednavek obcerstveni a ne, ze budeme vsechno delat pres internet, ktery v pripade regiojet vlaku funguje jak se mu zachce….. | nefunguje, a kdyz uz funguje tak vse sold out | Aplikace nelze spustit. Po spuštění hned spadne a takhle pořád dokola | Občerstvení nebylo možné objednat, protože celá cesta do Prahy byla údajně přes les, kde není připojení k Wi-Fi, což je sice “omluva”, která je však zcela nepřijatelná. ČR není jeden velký prales. Závěrem bych do této recenze chtěl poznamenat, že i ČD mají mnohem lepší servis. Děkuji Vám za pochopení a případné zkvalitnění Vašich služeb. | Žlutými vlaky pravidelně jezdím už nějaký ten rok. Po aktualizaci žádné chyby nezmizely. Zdá se mi, že se kvalita aplikace čím dál více zhoršuje. Mrzí mě to, protože kvůli tomu někdy nezvládnu koupit jízdenku a musím se spolehnout na jiného dopravce. | I once went on a journey to Pardubice hl.n. from Prague main station. The train went on time even ahead of the schedule and the service was amazing. In 3 minutes a stevard was checking our tickets, then 15 minutes before stopping in our destination we asked for a dessert. It came really quickly! It was delicious. I would recommend for yall to travel with RegioJet. The seat cost 82kč and was really comfy and silent. Chargers worked enough room. Amazing! 5 stars easy to use. | I’m always using app to book tickets, very convenient | Nejhorší aplikace + služba kterou jsem nucen používat na mobilu... Server vám asi běží na bramboře, protože kdykoliv když se snaží aplikaci použít víc než 5 lidí tak je zasekana, zachybovana různými způsoby... Nedají se po zrušení jízdenky koupit jízdenky znovu, i když k dispozici zřejmě jsou někomu jinému v prohlížeči.. Je takový problém přikoupit pár serverů nebo si je třeba dynamicky půjčovat z cloudu v době zátěže ať je aplikace použitelná když ji lidi potřebujou? Nechte se inspirovat českými drahami které mají krásnou funkční appku už roky... Lidi co stojí za funkcionalitou této aplikace + toho ""serveru"" (teda spíš nějakého starého běžícího noťasu z roku 2005 někde ve sklepě) pošlete do někam a najměte jiné lidi či firmu.. (vizuální design aplikace je přijatelný) | Application is useless. Food order is repeatedly impossible. Also the service is last years very bad. repeated delays and problems due to operational reasons. No food on international ways, only snacks. | Vždy když na iPhonu stornuji jízdenku, napíše mě to, že se nepovedlo jízdenku stornovat i přesto, že se jízdenka opravdu stornuje a kredit mě to připíše. Na Androidu vše funguje v pořádku. | jakej kreten mel napad zakazat cestujicim si objednat obcerstveni od stewardek ktery chodej po vlaku??? prinuti vas stahnout si tuhle prisernou nefukncni aplikaci i presto ze na vetsine drahy neni dostatecny signal. kdyz se po 40 minutach konecne tenhle odpad stahne, a vy se pokusite poprosit o vodu, aplikace vas posle doprdele stejne jako stewardi. dekuju regiojete za dalsi obohacujici zkusenost, s vama uz nikdy nikam. sem mohl jet konskym povozem a bylo by to komfortnejsi tyvole. ostuda. | Aplikace je naprosto nepoužitelná. Pravidelně hlásí, že je přetížená. Jízdenky nejdou stornovat jedním kliknutím, musíte pořad klikat dokud nemáte štěstí a jizdenka se najednou stornuje. Naprosto šílené. Opravte to prosím | Aplikace se neustále seká a nelze vyhledávat či kupovat jízdenky. Přes web mi to pro jistotu píše že vybrané spojení neexistuje, a to s ním jezdím denně. | Padá, píše než připojení k síti nebo že právě vyhledává moc lidí… Jízdenku nejde téměř koupit. Taky se stále odhlašuje. | Nejlepší app ever | Pokud tato záležitost má nějakého Product ownera, tak potěš. Poslední novinka při cestě vlakem do Tater je ""automatický logoff každých 5 minut"".. | Uz asi mesic mam problem, kdyz chci stornovat mistenku. Hazi to hlasku, ze ji nejde stornovat a po chvili je preso stornovana.

S regiojetem jezdim roky, mam je rada, ale aplikace je skutecne horsi a horsi a mj je casto pretizena. | You can’t order anything from the app. It’s constantly loading | Musím říct, že appka od českých drah je mnohem lépe provedena z pohledu UX designu. Ukončilo mi to spoj ještě před dokončení jízdy a nezobrazilo zpoždění. Používám ji jen kvůli místenkám, jinak bych se na to vykašlala. | Od poslední aktualizace aplikace skoro vůbec nefunguje… aplikace neustále padá, odhlasuje apod. Když chci koupit vlak, tak čekám i 10 minut, než se nacte nabídka, taky je problém zaplatit - neustále se to nacita a nemáte možnost zaplatit… i při stornu vlaku to hází problém… Aplikace kdysi fungovala bez problému, ale teď tam nefunguje vůbec nic… | It’s a shame, doesn’t work properly but it’s you one chance to order food. The apple pay doesn’t work. | Nelze objednat občerstvení jinak než přes tuto aplikaci. Na 4 nápoje jsme čekali 55 minut. | Compared to what it used to be, it's now way more usable. Some notes for improvements
- App often logs me out, often it happens right before I need to show the ticket to a bus driver and it's super stress inducing, if I hadn't had my credentials saved in keychain I'd probably use the email QR code
- When the ticket is open with the QR code showing and you leave the app and return, the on appear refreshes the view sometimes taking a long time before showing again, also stress inducing when the bus driver is waiting, would recommend a little smarter silent refresh without the presentation breaking
- Not sure if this is intentional and probably backend related but sometimes theres only a few seats left in the map (bus) if i only have one passenger selected and then if I select two most of the bus is empty. It happened to me a couple of times that i was offered 3 seats available and then the bus was empty.

Love the live activity!

Everyrhing up to date. | Super | Updates in last year are all about introducing more ways to monetize, but no real advantages or improvements added… Skip this app

Let me be clear about this - as a long time user of this application and occasional subscriber (my subscription recently expired), I was shocked that they recently blocked basic functionality that was for free until now and they started to force users to pay for subscription instead. I would gladly subscribe if that would brought me some new functionality. As a matter of fact, application haven’t been extended with new functionality for a very long time (we’re talking years) and instead it was more and more stripped off good ones. Well, I’m receiving messages from them to become ambassador, but I will instead look for an alternative and I will stop using this one. | No possibility to share the details of the trip, such as the exact date and time of the flight! So why then this app exists 🤦🏻‍♀️ | $40 per year is very too much! 🤬 Where is little tarif on $10? | Well, don’t know when this update has happened, but I only updated today and the feature I loved the most is under the “premium” now, so even the basics information like how many flights you’ve had this year is not for free anymore.

I’ve been using this app for 5 years religiously, because it kept all the statistics, but now I lost access to any of it. Nice job.

I feel like in the past few years this app has lost its original purpose - I don’t want to book flights, I don’t need to book hotels, I just want to keep track of my flights.

I really don’t know what I’m paying for rn, flight alerts don’t work great, any of your paid features are easily accessible and much better through other free apps/airport websites. | Good for more transfers, business trips, information about gate (chnage gate), delay your flight and … | Great and easy to use. | I needed some support in App this week. Response was quick, qualified and helpfull. | gate, delay or other data is not updated. | Мне очень нравится, использую уже несколько лет:) перелеты становятся проще и интереснее с этим приложением | Product that change whole industry.I believed that vision, in fact that product changed industry if we’re builded.Jobs say that all life wanna build SIRI.I say Jobs was geniuses the most, I believed him and I’m ready when you are… | Aplikace je skvělá, podařilo se mi s ní vyřešit jednoho problému na cestách!!!Třeba když jsem letěl na Maledivy, takVůbec nehlásily že by měl let zpoždění, ale Aplikace App in the Air Mě na to upozornila prostřednictvím oznámení. Díky ní jsem si nemusel kupovat další letenku, takže velmi oceňuji. Hezký den | I’m designer and developer and I love the design of this app. Every feature is also very useful. I just love it. | Hi developers, I spent a lot of time in the past adding many flights I have made during last couple years. Now I checked the app and past trips are only in “trips” but they do not show up in overview. How it is possible? Is there any way how to update that? It is frustrating. Thanks guys! | I find it useful and convenient | Great iOS app. Love it so much! It’s just a pity you cannot buy single trip premium. | For traveling it is a very nice app. But why does it want all my passwords in my iPhone and it is doing the same function as the keyring? Wtf | Хорошее приложение. Пользуюсь уже года 4. Все организовано. Очень помогает. | I love the app. Bought a lifetime subscription and I’ve used it in all my last 300k km in the air! | Už si bez ní neumím představit cestování. | Great one | Best flying app I’ve ever used. | The Apple Watch app is super helpful. | It's a best app to track your trip by plane. | I love the app it's so helpful, at first I didn't like the UI but got used to it, the app is marvellous | Perfect | 👍 perfect app for traveling and to have all info in one place | Great App for fanatics travellers. User friendly and very usefull. | Ok | I like travel expenses section...saves lot of time | I love this! But iam sad that i haven’t this app before, i’d have more achivements...or is there some way to add previous flights? | Thank you | Really helpful | All information in the app are great including automatic check-in and other great features. Just missing two things:
- parsing and showing seat from automatic check-in somewhere visible for first look
- prepare boarding pass and add it to my iphone wallet | It’s simply the most advanced and intuitive app helping to track your departure time, and all other important details and statistics about your flights. | Zakoupil jsem si doživotní verzi aplikace a strhli mi 799 Kč za roční předplatné a 1299 za doživotní předplatné! | No update at all, I expected information but even airport screens were faster than this app, no gate info, no delay info, app deleted :( | you have all of the important info there, check-in possible | Super je, ze zadas cislo letu a dohleda se zbytek, lety se spoji nebo je muzes rozpojit. Vis, kde jsi kde byl nebo kdy a kam ti leti nekdo znamy... super jednoduchy a prehledny itinerar a informace, kdy to leti, za jak dlouho je check-in, kdy se nastupuje, pri letu dava info, kokik jeste zbyva do konce, takze neni treba pouzivat stopky :) ja jsem uz nekolik let absulutne spoko... | This app only wants your personal data... and money. | Good idea but bugs that make the app frustrating to use | I have been using this app for about 3 years now and alway find it as a useful way of getting overview of my upcoming and past flights at one place. Pleasant UI, easy to search for your flights by code, date of departure or just destination. I do recommend this one! | Not satisfied with this app at all, doesn’t send any messages, if there is delay. I receive a message saying the flight is delayed when I arrived to my destination. I don’t recommended this horrible app. Maybe for the flights that are in Europe it doesn’t work that well. U can’t rely on this app. It doesn’t show gates you have to go to, it is useless. | Nice | Aplikace je perfektní, používám doživotní předplatné a jsem moooc spokojený. Na Apple Watch je vše důležité vidět a notifikace jsou perfektní i když se mi už také stalo ze přišli pozdě. Jednou dokonce vůbec. Aplikace je neustále lepší a pravidelně aktualizovaná. Za mě lepší nenajdete. | Nice | Amazing app! It can make your traveling easier! I’m always using it. | I was already using it for few months, really enjoying it and I got new phone and when I logged in with facebook all my flights are gone. BTW I was ready to buy subscription. Is there a way how to get them back please? | Spokojenost, mám zde uloženy všechny minulé lety a vždy používám pro ty přede mnou",4.63298,564,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/5e/fc/af/5efcaf98-8544-f220-2c86-77d6ee6ed548/8d66386d-b280-4374-8b35-7a9bf8db137d_ScreenX_1-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/e9/05/35/e905353e-4a20-2b6e-129f-2a66358cd889/4a0ac7a2-210a-4235-9703-286e6c6e4a36_ScreenX_2-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/8a/47/fb/8a47fb82-fb71-4434-88a5-59b92c1c3c28/1d96e8ae-c7a8-4218-bbdb-5830acb00bc1_ScreenX_3-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/61/2b/56/612b569e-1e35-796d-e599-62b41e566c6b/0ab8f635-a4cb-4f4a-8dba-7dc38bd40fe7_ScreenX_4-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0b/b1/35/0bb1352a-c4e9-859c-1b4d-a405edfe5cfd/8ef659c1-3811-4493-8450-9e09c2624bd8_ScreenX_5-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/42/07/09/4207098b-9f03-4636-3047-16a4a5fe0461/fd9c331c-f6b5-47dc-af07-52a3b2e85841_ScreenX_6-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/1b/b0/e0/1bb0e0da-7d80-1bda-0bba-790dcb386997/cb33f73d-7073-45c9-95bb-197f9a5dba0a_ScreenX_7-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/da/e5/fc/dae5fcd2-2a49-e9fe-de38-334e37e96be3/cd2f32f2-0f92-4275-9f57-236bb681626d_ScreenX_8-3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/bb/cb/5e/bbcb5ec3-a8f9-573f-72be-7fabfb1b9643/a25e8a0a-c060-4944-a0dd-86e7810c825b_ScreenX_9-3.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/62/e1/1a/62e11a86-d06d-dacb-129e-fc9335834690/5d9f0c4f-a0ff-488d-b17e-4d51e7d559f4_1.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/25/c2/66/25c266f0-581e-ab0c-4de7-ab07781c21d8/6e1a456c-38e9-4125-b349-b47859e87689_2.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/77/ef/21/77ef218a-140f-e42a-c96f-584de0e33552/ec285422-f780-4495-8f4f-34faab77f353_3.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/14/9a/95/149a9591-d5bd-d69b-98be-fa90e514c935/997edfce-c9ca-4e4f-b1a8-1c39165a933b_4.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/57/ce/7d/57ce7d56-d045-9e32-0f1c-5313017ae11c/c298c522-fb28-4c29-83dc-28c948f8dfbf_5.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/18/53/cd/1853cd42-c631-ef99-5dce-1e3ec6a11c99/9ea8a7ef-6aea-4847-aac5-73c7b0893d61_6.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/0d/50/28/0d502871-48d1-22ab-c975-4c2c1ac14e2b/0b66fa04-0396-4110-b617-0b139b792dbb_7.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/64/fb/73/64fb738e-f3b1-ade3-5cd3-23c951c32018/31d49a75-2f76-4703-974f-7dfc56986b27_8.png/552x414bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5e/73/6b/5e736bf7-3020-d1c1-ae36-bc26b1f6d208/94016475-e3cb-4905-9439-080e9af92abf_9.png/552x414bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCe

So you must be ready, that your money would bee stolen. | The Expedia App US has what’s most important for me - it’s very easy to use, very fast, intuitive and big free. | We had a confirmed reservation and paid insurance for our first days in Dominican Republic, however when we arrived, they told us in the airport there are NO cars available!!! When we asked how is that possible, they told us that online You are able to do as many reservations as you want but that in reality they don’t have so much cars!!! We were not the only ones with this problem as a couple came after us with the same problem. The staff did not offered us any solutions or compensation!!. We tried to book a car with another agency but it was too late and they had no cars available, so THEIR MISTAKE cost us 400$ as we had to go from Punta Cana to Puerto plata by taxi!!!

Nemůžem dostatečně vynachválit | 1) I would suggest the developer to make it possible to add photos to places. As a user, I did not find such an option in the application. I would like the most to add photos under ""Edit this place"". I missed the photos of the social facilities in the camps the most.

2) I would also add the option of adding the opening hours of the campsite reception - accessible to every user with a choice for which period the given time is valid and with the date the user added this time. | Paradni app, moc nam pomohla pri ceste po Nemecku, Lichtenstainsku, Italii i Rakousku.

Parada | Naprosto skvělá aplikace, vše funguje na 1* moc dobré tipy na výlety a skvělé informace o městech a oblastech. Dekujeme | Skvěký pomocník na výlety. Používám již pár let. Nová verze se skutečně povedla! | Aplikace nabízí funkci zaslání zvolené trasy na e-mail. Bohužel funkce nefunguje. | Dobra aplikace se spoustou tipu na bike vylet.Jedine co mi chybi je po otevreni dane stezky,kde je mapa a dalsi informace navigace.U kazde stezky  je sice naosan pruvodce kudy jet,ale je tak strohy,ze je v podstate nepouzitelny a kdo se bude porad divat do nobilu a cist kudy ma jet,nikdo. | Nejde odeslat gpx, aplikace k ničemu | Myšlenka v principu dobrá, ale aplikace je velmi ""cyklocentrická"". Pěších výletů je v ní jako šafránu. Proč ne, ale pak bych prostě aplikaci pojmenoval jen ""Na kole"", protože pro ty, kterým jde jen o pěší turistiku, je docela na nic. | přijde mi gpx na mail dřív, než na ten výlet pojedu? proč si gpx nemůžu uložit přes systémový sdílení? | Vynikající pomocník | Výborná aplikace na dovolenou po Čechách | Byla jsem moc spokojená, bohužel poslední týdny nefungují oblíbená místa. Přišla jsem tak o nalezené uložené stezky. Zkusila jsem odinstalovat a nainstalovat znovu, ale fungovalo to jen pár hodin a pak znovu uložená místa zmizela. | Super aplikace... | Super aplikace... | Na cestách výborná inspirace k místním výletům do okolí. | Jsem nadšená,přesně to mi scházelo..za mě úplně super 🤗.Díky 👍 | Perfektní aplikace. Díky za ní. Jen drobný námět na vylepšení - možnost označení tras, které už jsem projel. | NEJ-APKA pro rodinné výlety a pro všechny, kteří žijí svůj život aktivně!!!  
Kdo ji jednou zkusi, už u ní rozhodně zůstane 👏 👏👏 doporučuji!!! | Moc hezká aplikace. Ocenil bych, kdyby šla například trasa sdílet. Také u některých míst důvod, proč bychom se tam měli zastavit. Např. zajímavá místa: vodohospodářská firma. Proč tam je? Dělá exkurze? Bude v pořádku ji jako laik kontaktovat? Jinak velice cením nápad i zpracování. | Top strop na pole | Krásné tipy tip na výlet | Nápad dobry ale nechápu proč je třeba zapínat GPS kdyz chci program použit. Lokací k vyhledávání zadávám manuálne. K čemu je programu ze mne vidí třeba v Praze kdyz chci hledat trasy 5 km kolem Příbrami? Tras je celkem málo (asi přibudou časem další ) ale určitě to nenabízí trasy podle zadaných parametru. | Nevím jak jinde, ale u nás v Českém Švýcarsku vedou “cyklovýlety” i po turistických cestách kde je spousta lidí, schodů a nesmí se tam na kole🤦‍♂️ Je vidět, že autoři jen slepě kopírují z internetu a mapy, a to z mylnými informacemi... | Cením tuhle aplikaci, příjemní propagátoři na Ostravskem veletrhu xd | Paradni aplikace na vylety | Perfektní aplikace, určitě stojí za stažení ;) | Děkuji za tuto aplikaci - častokrát se vracíme při turistice na stejná oblíbená místa, s aplikací můžeme objevovat nová, která nejsou daleko.

Potkám i milé s sympatické řidiče, kteří si někdy i popovídají. | Řidiči neumějí absolutně řídit, snad ani jeden! | Byla jsem vždycky spokojená s aplikací ale zablokovali mi účet ikdyž poctivě platím, jsem slušná a nechávám řidičům dokonce i spropitné . Po jedné jízdě kdy byl řidič nevychovaný hulvát, tak mě zablokovali a proto dávám 1 hvězdičku | No dark mode | Vždy jsme spokojena🍀🍀🍀 | Recently had an incident where the driver indicated that they arrived, even though they hadn’t. They charged a waiting fee. I submitted a complaint and was told the fee would be refunded, but wasn’t. 
Beware of this scam. Or use uber instead. | Hong Hong | 6krat som si vyžiadal jazdu z letiska, 5krat prijali a následne zrušili. Jedenkrát hneď zrušil. Prosím vyriešte to. | Tuto aplikaci odinstaluji. Již po několikáté jsem měla s řidiči velmi špatnou zkušenost. Dnes jsem jela z centra Prahy-Anděl. Řidič vjel na hlavní silnici před obchodní centrum, je tam zákaz vjezdu. Zastavila nás okamžitě policie a pán dostal pokutu. Vypsání pokuty trvalo nějakých 15 min, pán neuměl ani česky ani anglicky a policista se s ním nemohl domluvit. Následně přejel 2x vjezd do tunelu takže jsme celou lokalitu objeli několikrát. Cesta co trvá normálně pod 10 min trvala půl hodiny. Pán byl velmi zdvořilý a omluvil se mi, ale zvolím raději jiný styl dopravy. Necítila jsem se v autě komfortně. | Když je člověk potřebuje v ČR tak si raději zavolá taxi… | The driver is very nice person | App keeps showing something went wrong, when you need it 😑 | Nejen že dost lidí jezdí na účet jiných, ale i ty ceny jsou přepal! Lepší Uber nebo liftago | Never want to use Bolt anymore. The driver doesn’t speak local language and English, it’s very difficult for communication. Drivers most of them are foreigners and don’t farmilar with local routes and when drivers made wrong routes, if you contacted Bolt and you never refund!!! | Bolt is a very problematic. No respect on customers and same for drivers. Just use UBER!!! | Bohužel aplikace podporuje schvalování nacistických zločinů. | Pokud je treba doladit misto nastupu, tak se telefonicky ridicem nemusite domluvit mluvit cesky ani anglicky. | I had to pay twice for the trip because the driver didn’t see that the payment was online, he took the money in cash, and the support service couldn’t do anything😡😡😡 | Ceny super ale nefungoval mi ani chat a s řidičem se nešlo spojit ani přes app ani telefonu. | The drivers dont speaking a language and very rude with old cars | the app forces political views on me | I was visiting Prague lately and I cannot be more grateful. Great app, nice drivers ( all of them). Great cost. Going with my wife even cheaper then anything else. Thanks! | Why does the customer have to tip the driver within 15 minutes? Why can't it be later? That's not smart at all. I recommend that this shortcoming be corrected. | V poslefní době se množi v boltu neadekvatni řidiči kteři jsou vulgarní, současně mě zablokovaly bez udaní důvidu podpora vubec nereaguje divné jednani . | První zkušenost a hned špatně 🤦Zaplaceno předem řidič nepočkal ani 5 min a hned storno poplatek paráda asi neví ze je třeba se oblect a dat si boty 🤣🤣🤣Masakr tak se vydělává | I am deleting the app and never using Bolt taxi in Prague. Drivers are extremely unprofessional, rude, cars are dirty, they smell, the overall service and experience is disgusting. 

I would rather pay more but enjoy better local taxi service! | Nelze platit kartou | Jsem častým uživatelem kuriérských služeb v Praze, a poslední rok je moje zkušenost s Bolt Food asi ta nejhorší. Jídlo přichází neustále studené, sleduji aplikaci, restaurace připraví jídlo během chvíle, ale kurýr vyzvedá x objednávek a teprve poté moji. Za tyto problémy mi nabídnou omluvu ve výši 50 Kč. Stejný problém nastává i při používání služeb obchodů a květin. Kurýr často nemluví ani anglicky, ani česky. Na druhou stranu, Bolt vždy reaguje a poděkuje za zpětnou vazbu, když se jí obrátím na podporu. | Waiting For The Driver 25 minutes and in application was written that he arriving in 4 minutes. Driver don’t know city don’t know how to use navigation and also he was very arrogant. I missed train because of this and had to wait 7 hours for another train and had to buy another ticket, also didn’t get refund for missed train from train company and after all Bolt support is even worst then this driver when I complain, I have been waiting 4 hours for respond. And at the end my time nobody can compensate. Zero stars not one. Travel with “bolt cost you a lot”.- they can use this as a slogan for their company. | I really really hate when you give me two options. One for 2 minutes another for 3, I pay the extra money for the 2 minutes and then you connect me with a guy that will take 7 and is in another trip. Meaning, it won’t be 7. | I dont know why the app is so unfriendly.
Its such a struggle for me to easily navigate whether Im paying via my business or personal profile - mixed it up a bunch of times. I have no clue how to switch between them. Adding a new payment card was also a nightmare. Why? These things should be easy, I am using several different apps, I dont have time to investigate how to use them when I need to get somewhere urgently. | Řidič začal psát nevhodně mé přítelkyni přes whatsapp… | The courier delivered my food and drink was spilled in whole package and then I contact customer service and after investigation and asking lots of questions at the end they decided to give me 2.5 EUR credit. I will never use this app and will delete it now! | I was riding a scooter in Prague 10 and unexpectedly have entered a not supported ""red zone"". I didn't even know this was a thing, especially way within the city limits (where this red zone is drawn is only 4-5km from Václavské náměstí for example). So the scooter slowed down automatically, but in order to get out of the red zone, I had to change lanes on the street. However the red zone is drawn diagonally, so by changing directions I ended up being even deeper in the zone. Rain started pouring, I'm riding with 5km/h and I'm basically held hostage by Bolt - I can't end the trip, I can't move out of the zone quickly and the timer keeps charging me. That's nonsense! At least remove the speed if the scooter is moving in the right direction out of the red zone! | Nice helpful driver,safe drive,clean car,timely pick up | Řidič mě účtoval jízdu dvakrát ,zajímalo by mě ,kdo mě vrátí peníze",4.81601,35377,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/a4/56/31/a4563103-3e0e-130e-aeba-50e055adce3a/6f064145-cb87-448d-a619-6687ebb7ff20_5.5__EN-GB_1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/6c/b2/58/6cb25874-005a-be4f-d9c5-0bf3d769ee5f/18c04f64-c0dd-4a57-ac02-461443d2c5ae_5.5__EN-GB_2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/dc/d5/4c/dcd54c1f-e8f0-d9d1-916d-dfaf60205950/08457b4c-d794-4f68-a547-0fee4e6eb339_5.5__EN-GB_3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/5f/c4/40/5fc440c6-fe1d-dcc8-b302-9ff51c727d0f/9228529f-24d2-4608-b9a9-8b88daa2dfe7_5.5__EN-GB_4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/e8/73/d2/e873d24b-f5a7-b252-c084-45981879651d/09d66335-185f-40ca-9450-46563cb726be_5.5__EN-GB_5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/1c/1a/af/1c1aaf9f-3bdb-3ba7-30ab-bd7fe0102574/570ead3a-b7bb-4773-9eda-39a88b498832_5.5__EN-GB_6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Slow performance, extremely bad map and poor location search results. No way to properly import GPS location, searching is a lotery.

Is this actually considered helpful by anyone or are people using it just out of habit? | Po poslední aktualizaci na verzi 4.101.2.1 neni moznost během aktuální trasy volit mezi alternativními trasami v detailu trasy v nastavení. | After last update, no tacho showed via Carplay, although on mobile visible! | Dobrý den,

Opakovaně! | Po poslední aktualizaci (poslední verze), velké zhoršení‼️ | After few uses when Waze showed me totally disasterous way, decided to delete it for good. App is absolutely user unfriendly too. | I've been using this app many years. Unfortunately it stopped proposing alternative ways to go off highway when in front of me is crash. 
I got stuck in traffic so many times last months.
Really annoying. | Самое тупое приложение особенно в такси🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮ведет длинными дорогами если можно автобаном.

In setting I set all volume to max. | Posílá me do zácp👎 Přestávám používat! | I have been using Waze for several years, for the last 2 weeks the application has been unstable, unresponsive, gives errors and generally does not fulfill its purpose. | It used to be great, 5 stars without a doubts but ita getting to be worse and worse with every year (I use it like 7-8 years for sure). Also its not intuitive, sometimes when you think one would solve the need with one click it suddenly you need 2 more, without any reason. Also what i noticed is that when waze has choose a route, but you decide during the ride to use different route, it will recalculate the rout but will try to get you to the old rout and not calculating the best (quickest) route from the spot where you are ATM. Also, noticed that gmaps are MUCH more accurate in calculating arrival times on same route then WAZE. 
But, still using it daily, got used to it, its like a marriage we have our ups and downs :) | Prosim zrusit a stahnout z Appstore!!! Naprosto nefunkcni a marna navigace!! Spatne mapove podklady! Nezna ani Prahu. Neco strasneho. Prestante to nabizet jako navigaci!!!! | Now the navigation has led me into a total meltdown | Wireless connection to CarPlay display half speed under 50 km/h. Above that it display speed corectly. | Waze je bída, bída. Jediný plus, jak už tady někdo psal, jsou hlášené kontroly, prekvapka po cestě, ale jako navigace stojí za prd. Už jen to, ze vás táhne úzkýma uličkama, což vyhodnotí možná o tři vteřiny rychlejší cestou, nebo absolutně mimózním variantou cesty, kdy čekáte v hodinové koloně, zatímco v appce se uvádí 7 minut. Jak říkám, mimo totálně. | Již podruhé během týdne nejde spustit navigace. Předtím nešla celý den. | Waze byla absolutní jednička v on-line navigacích, bohužel byla.

Unusable as navigation | Proc me waze posila pres centrum mesta a tam jeste po malych ulicka, kdyz kolem mesta vede dalnice a ja mel cil cesty o X kilometru dal za timto mestem? A podobne vystrelky to dela neustale. Slysel jsem, ze waze takhle taha ridice po kotarech proto, aby “zjistíl” jaka je v danem miste situace. Je tohle pravda? Jestli ano, tak za me je to pekna prasarna. Waze jsem odinstaloval… | Super navigace, jediné, co mi na cestách dost dělá problém, pouze jeden průjezdní bod. Při cestování na motorce si u jiné aplikace udělám komplet trasu, ale tady bohužel musím pořád zastavovat a přenastavit navigaci na další místo. Nepřemýšlíte, že přidáte víc zastávek do itineráře? Díky👍 | K čemu Waze je, když ani nepozná, že je auto v tunelu a ne nad ním a tím pádem je nemožné zjistit čas příjezdu, když je v tunelu kolona!!!
Zároveň často se Waze seká když člověk už jede a potřebuje vidět trasu a Waze ukazuje nesmysly.
Celkově Waze ukazuje často že je cesta volná, přitom pak zjistíme, že tam jsou kolony…
šílený | Nápad aplikace i výhody za jízdy z pohledu řidiče jsou super. Bohužel, již X měsíců nefunguje na Apple CarPlay tlačítko “přidat akci” na mapu. (tím myslím policii, výmol atd…).

Už ji používat nebudu, našel jsem alternativu … | I have been happily using Waze in conjunction with my iPhone and then CarPlay in the car for many years. Mainly that after entering my appointment into the calendar, Waze automatically retrieved the address and then sent me 1. a notification about 1.5h before and 2. a notification 10 minutes before the ideal departure time. For over a year now, I've been dealing with a problem in CarPlay where after starting, Waze starts to lag until the map completely breaks down. I have to switch to some setting in the car menu, and when I return to the Waze map it tends to be fine for the rest of the drive. But the worst started recently. After one of the last updates, I spent some time looking for where the scheduled rides disappeared to. But I found it and it worked like old times. But about a week ago, my calendar items stopped loading or showing up in ""Schedule a Ride"". I didn't change anything in the settings. On the contrary checked and everything is set correctly as before. I reinstalled Waze, reset my phone (I have an iPhone 13 with the latest version of iOS 16.6). What's extra weird is that even though there is nothing visibly loaded in ""Schedule a ride"", I get a departure notification sometimes 10 minutes before the ride.
So I can't rely on Waze anymore and use a different navigation. | Blbá navigace!!!! | Po aktualizaci komplet ticho, v iphone je problém ji zavřít. | Poté co mě to nahnalo do totální zácpy a trasu kterou bych jel polovinu času jsem měl dvakrát tak dlouho, tak už to v telefonu nechci,

Co vsak zlobi je: 
Vyber mista (kdyz je to spoluprace se zahranicnim dopravcem budto nelze zobrazit plan, nebo nelze mistenku urcit vubec, problem kdyz cestujeme ve vice lidech)

Na iOS nemoznost pridat koupenoj jizdenku do kalendare (na androidu ok)

Zruseni jizdneho, trva strasne dlouho vyplaceni a spousta spamu o zrusene jizdence. Dokonce se mi ti v apce jedniu kouslo kdyz jsem zrusil jizdenku kterou jsem chtel z casri pokryt CD body, body uz veaceny nebyly a prisel jsem o ne. | Velká škoda, že nejsou integrované regionální tarify IREDO | making a reservation doesnt work the app shuts down | Funkce v aplikaci se mi líbí, je super, aplikaci používám pár let, dávám 5 hvězdiček, hezký den! 😎 | Dobrý den,
aplikace vám padá při výběru místa z plánku vlaku na iOS. Na Androidu je však vše funkční. | Vždy když zadám do aplikace kolo automaticky celá aplikace spadne. | Za to nastavení svícení na max po zakoupení lístku bych vraždil. Pokaždý mi to vypálí trochu sítnice když ležím večer v posteli. | Aplikaci využívám několik let a chválím ji, kudy chodím. V poslední době se ale setkávám s problémem s platbou kartou. Po zaplacení se aplikace nepřestává načítat a musím ji ukončit a znovu spustit, abych si mohla zobrazit zakoupenou jízdenku. | aplikaci používam už pět let a poslední dobou pořád něco nefunguje. Už od prosince mi nejde koupit místenka, spadne mi celá aplikace a když se jedná o vytížený spoj, musím koupit přes Idos, abych tu místenku měla... | Skvělá aplikace na nákup jízdenek, akorat asi před měsícem mi začala aplikace blbnout, a při nákupu mistenky vzdy aplikace crashne. Reinstall, vypnutí zapnutí mobilu nepomohlo. Problém přetrvává. | Nelze zakoupit jízdenku, protože nelze vyhledat spojení protože je v nastavení zakázáno hledat online. Nastavení jsem nenašel. Data jsou pro app povolena. Mizerná androidí app portovaná na ios. | Pokazdy co otevru appku tak se naseru, mohl by to vyvijet nekdo kdo nema IQ kamene, diky | Používala jsem apku léta a byla jsem hodně spokojená. Teď jsem přišla na IOS a nemůžu si koupit místenku. To je hodně velký nedostatek. | Po instalaci na novy iphone s vyssi verzi sw nefunguje moznost vybrat si mistrnku - de pouze automaticky a podobne nefunguje rexervace kola | Zbytečná app. ČD nikdy, ale opravdu nikdy nejezdí včas, takže se vaše každé pár hodinové cestování, mění na neplánované celodenní dobrodružství. | Super a přehledná aplikace, akorát mi spadne vždy když si chci vybrat místenku z plánku. | Aplikace sama o sobě je dobrá a dostatečně funkční. Zpoždění se aktualizují rychle. Nachází dobré návaznosti spojů. ALE. Když si teď chci rezervovat místenku tak aplikace crashne!
Prosím o opravu této chyby. | Vždy když klepnu na řádek odkud aplikace spadne. | Nejde mi přes aplikaci koupit mistenka | Aplikace je super,protože s touto aplikaci nemusím ukazovat jízdenku a in kartu ,ale stačí jeden kód in karty z této aplikace a je to.daji se zde ukázat kde sedím a taky aplikace upozorňuje na stanice ve které se vlak nachází. Bohužel aplikace Začala padat při  zadávání místenku což je obrovský mínus. Doufám že dojde brzy k nápravě.😉 | application provides false information on trains, absolutely useless and full of lies, don’t recommend it !! | Smekám před vývojovým týmem aplikace a vedení. Aplikace má spousty malých drobných vychytávek pro pohodlí uživatele. Nejvíc nadšený jsem z možnosti koupit jízdenku na 3 kliknutí, platba Apple pay a možnost uložit jízdenky do peněženky | Pomohlo mi aktualizovat iOS systém. | Zhruba od poloviny prosince nefunguje v aplikaci výběr místenky. Nejen, že nefunguje, ale aplikace se po klepnutí na místenku zcela sama vypne. Nutno potom znovu nastavit všechny parametry znovu. Místenku si nevyberu, což mi jako člověku s tělesným postižením dost vadí. Mrzí mě to. Děkuji za nápravu. | Aplikace se mi líbí. Když nestíhám, ušetří mi čas a já vše stihnu. | Nefunguje si koupit místenku, aplikace se mi vypíná jakmile si chci místenku vybrat. Prosím opravte to byla to skvělá aplikace ale bohužel si teď musím kupovat jízdenky přes IDOS. | Synchronizace inkarty se ani nepokusi o synchronizaci v posledni verzi CD iOS aplikace. Nevrati zadny error, nic se nestane. Tlacitko se vrati okamzite do predchoziho stavu. Karta je platna, s platnou aplikaci, pridana v uzivateli.

Pokud se jedna o tu magii s periodickou aktivaci karty na prepazce, tak prosim dejte jednoznacny feedback v podobe snackbaru nebo cehokoliv jineho. V soucasnosti to je nepripustne UX. | No live activity implemented | Again mistakes in my reservation. Map of reservation either doesnt work at all or shows something and reality is different. | Doopravdy nejste schopni 2 týdny opravit nákup místenky? | Jednoduché na ovládání, přehledné. Používám často a bez problémů. | People are not given enough information about the journey like seats and when you get in the train you have to be waiting for someone to tell you to move out of their reserved seats! The tickets are expensive but with bad service! | Není možné si objednat místenku | Už přes týden mi v appce nejde zarezervovat místenku.Při kliknutí na “vybrat místo k sezení “ se pokaždé appka vypne. | Během nákupu jízdenky se po zaškrtnutí volby výběru místenky z plánku aplikace samočinně vypne. | Too much cancellation fee.
Special ehrn inter country, the cancellation fee is 100%.

I am not booking again from muj vlak from inter country. | Aplikace velmi dobrá, ale v poslední době často nefunkční při načítání cen a on-line dat a na aplikaci se nedá spolehnout. | Poslední týden vyhazuje chybu při vyhledávání spojů. Nejde kupovat jízdenky. | Prosím, přineste podporu Live Activities a Dynamic Island pro iPhone. Navíc detailní informace v jízdence při uložení do Peněženky by se hodily, aby se potom mohly zobrazovat na uzamčené obrazovce. | Tlačítko na prodáni při lístku tam je, ale když na něho kliknu tak zobrazí chybu: “Nebyly nalezeny žádné jízdenky pro Peněženku Apple.” | Dobrý den, aplikaci používám, je velmi užitečná, bohužel nejde změnit velikost čtení u písma, což u většiny aplikací jde, takže při větším počtu jízdenek, kdy si člověk nepamatuje vše, musím hledat v tašce brýle...j | Dobrý den,

Mohla by aplikace přestat ignorovat systémovou velikost písma a barevný profil? Když je noc, mám v telefonu všude bílé písmo na černém pozadí, pak otevřu vaši aplikaci a vypálí mi to oči.

Děkuji | Spolehlivě fungující appka, rychlé vyhledávání spojů, jednoduché placení i předkládání jízdenky (QR kódy), možnost skupinových atd., pohotové info o zpoždění, výlukách (náhradních spojích), mohla by být za mě možná malinko víc user-friendly, ale jsem spokojen, cestuji s ní denně. | Spokojen s aplikaci na Androidu, uvidím jak bude fungovat má iPhonu | Aplikace sama o sobě podle mých zkušeností funguje, líbí se mi praktické funkce jako notifikace vlaku, kterým jedu (/který mě zajímá). Ale zjistil jsem, že jízdenka koupená přes tuto aplikaci je dražší, než jízdenka koupená např. v automatu přímo ve vlaku. To bych vlastně nečekal. Takže bohužel už nadále nebudu jízdenky kupovat přes aplikaci, byť nákup jako takový je velice pohodlný, ale budu je kupovat jiným způsobem (u nás v kraji např. přes aplikaci krajského systému dopravy). | Nabízet zrušení jízdenky i po 15 min limitu je velmi neetická praktika a proti dobrým mravům.

Jízdenku jsem vrátil chvilku po limitu, peníze zpět jsem nedostal a jízdenku, kterou bych jinak mohl použít na pozdější vlak, jsem také neměl. 

Můžete tvrdit, že s tím uživatel souhlasí v podmínkách, ale v první řadě byste vůbec neměli umožnit vrátit / zrušit jízdenku po daném 15 min limitu.",4.68426,18664,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/3f/17/ea/3f17ea7e-ed8d-95a1-b4ac-0f5877fe45dc/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/f1/81/ac/f181ac47-294a-004e-2ced-d80fd24d7eb8/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/70/bc/11/70bc1168-8694-9fcc-968a-201e816f61f9/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/18/33/1a/18331a02-2e12-a275-b3a1-963ef7683db0/mzm.giakoepq.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/44/df/ce/44dfcebf-67ea-7422-7e01-2c7b05a9f79a/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Zaplatila jsem řidiči 185 Kč a stejná castka mě býka stržena z účtu. Psala jsem i na podporu, ale odpověď jsem nedostala. No co se dá dělat. V. Behounkova | Super řidič | Během jízdy je možnost vybrat spropitné, které řidič po jízdě dostane. Zvolil jsem tedy spropitné. Po skončení jízdy také vyskočí nabídka spropitného. Myslel jsem, že mám potvrdit jeho výši.

K mému překvapení jsem na výpisu ke kartě našel spropitné zaúčtováno dvakrát. 💸

Tento způsob zadávání spropitného považuji za vrcholně matoucí. První spropitné, na stránce probíhající jízdy, přitom ani nevyžadovalo potvrzení TouchID. | Chválím řidiče jel moc pěkně , byl ochotný a super se s ním pokecalo , tak držím palce a přeji jen dobré recenze ! | Dear,
I’m really surprised that time for trip cancellation is 0min.
So you can immediately stole the money from account!

ST | zrusite mi auto a pak chcete pokutu | Super jizda | awful thing | Moje prvni jizda s Uber. Uber napsal, ze auto prijede za 9 minut, po 7 minutach jsem volal ridici, ktery me ujistil, ze prijede, za dalsich 5 min tu jizdu zrusil a Uber mi hledal noveho ridice, ktery prijel po 10ti minutach a byl super. Puvodniho ridice ( ukrajince ) ma Uber vyhodit | Really nice guy! Thank you! | My first experience in the US with Uber. Driver was very nice and kind man. Car was specious and super clean. Great experience, thank you. | Drivers don’t arrive to the pick up point waiting for you to cancel the trip (stand for half an hour somewhere or just driving around the district). And Uber support supports this way of service and charges you money if you didn’t wait for the driver for 45 minutes | Službu využívám krátce , vlastně z donuceni , ale líbí se mi jak to všechno krásně funguje. Auto bylo ve vteřině na místě , čisté a ridic mi pomohl s kufry do auta . Budete se divit, ale není to běžné . V Koreji ridic ani nevyleze z auta a nezatopi. Auto bylo čisté a ridic velmi milý . | When ordering a ride, you can’t swap the pick up location with the destination. It makes reordering a previously taken ride useless if I want to for instance ride back from my previous drop off to the location I was picked up at.

Also, when the app opens after ride started, it stops the music app from playing to play a ding sound and then it doesn’t resume the music again!! | just lost 5 minutes waiting and then driver took another(better offer)........... | Aplikace k ničemu, po nějakých změnách nenachází řidiče, BOLT řidiče najde hned👍 | I MUST STOP World WAR 3 | Spamming commercials nonstop. When disabled all notifications settings, after restarting app its all on again. What a coincidence. | Ok, Uber officially becam worst service ever. Just ordered a ride in Barcelona. The driver went from opposite part of the city. Have waited for him for 30!minutes without any option to cancel that time length. Now we are stuck in some traffic jam due to his route change.
Cant find any way to cancel and refund this ride. It took me already 1hour of my life! | Poslední dobou čekám na objednané auto i několik minut a když nezruším objednávku já, zruší to rovnou aplikace Uber. Čekání na řidiče, který by objednávku přijal, je tak dlouhé, že raději využiji aplikaci Bolt, kde mám jistotu jízdy. | Worst drivers. Will let you wait in order to get money. Not reliable at all. Do not recommend. | Díky | Moc dekuji za skvele svezeni. Pan Ridic byl moc mily. | Super perfecto! | Nelibi se mi cekaci doba 30 min, a  kvulu tomu musela jsem zadavat objednavku 3 krat, a naposled stratila jsem cislo domu odkud se mam svezt. Drive to bylo dle lokaci odkud volam. Dekuji ridici ze me nasel. S pozdravem, Ebrova | This happens more and more often. Drivers never come and I keep waiting. | Je to stejný po celým světě nejen taxikáři v ČR okrádají turisty. Zaplatíte uberu kartou v aplikaci a přijede řidič za 3 hodiny po objednání jízdy a chce peníze cash ještě jednou, ale i 3x vyšší taxu za jízdu. A začne vyhrožovat, že jestli zákazník neakceptuje jeho podmínky přepravy stornuje mu jízdu a bude muset vystoupit. Až po mé odpovědi, že zavolám policii, se uklidnil a provedl cestu, tak jak byla zaplacena kartou a dopředu! 

Za 3 hodiny čekání mi 2x stornoval řidič jízdu, protože si vybral zakázku ekonomicky výhodnější opravdu katastrofa…

Druhý den a další jízda, už zase perfektní řidič a služby nevím, nevím kam to uber takhle dotáhl …. 😔😞😝 | In Czech Republic average waiting time is 8 mins. and drivers keep canceling after you wait 4-5 minutes. So, you might end with 15-20mins waiting for a uber. Not so helpful. | I rarely order Uber, only in cases when Bolt is not available, but each one of the encounters with the Uber drivers left me unsatisfied, many of them just drive past your location, and when you call them, they were silent for 10 seconds and ended a call.
The fee for 40 kc, doesn't make sense to me at all, the two times i cancelled the ride, was when the driver was not moving for 5 minutes straight, and when Uber is asking you for a reason of cancellation, you confidently press ""the driver wasnt moving"", but oh uh, you still have to pay the fee, the reason doesn't really matter. First time i decided to not go against it, but the second time the same honest mistake, im deleting the app, and never coming to it again, please fix your app. | Objednáte si odjezd za 20minut, auto nepřijede.
V aplikaci donekonečna svítí hledáme vám řidiče, i když už měl být dávno na místě!
Zrušíte jízdu, objednáte novou s odjezdem ihned, čekáte 16minut.
Původní jízda se mezitím přeplánuje za 24hodin.
Takže vám ji Uber za 24hodin naúčtuje.
Objednání na čas totálně nepoužitelná služba!
Nefungovalo to před 5ti rokama a nafunguje to stále!!! | Uber používáme převážně v cizině a funguje na 110% 👍👏😉 | we have ordered a car from the Hurghada airport through the app for 97 L.E.   But the driver charged us 10€:-( | Dobrý den.
Nelíbí se mi, že si nemohu zvolit značku, velikost, popř. typ auta. Až do objednání nevím, co vlastně přijede. | Tahle appka víc komplikuje život než zjednodušuje, několikrát se mi stalo, že jsem čekala na taxi víc než 20 minut! Občas se taky stávalo, že jsem čekala 10 minut, pak když už řidič byl vedle mě, zrušil jízdu. Je opravdu loterie, jestli přijedu kam potřebuju včas. Doporučuji Bolt | Hrozná zkušenost po objednání a zaplacení se z doby čekání místo 8 Min změnilo na 22 Min a nakonec to řidič zrušil a ja mel čekat na jiného dalších 10 Min otřesné, strašně neprofesionální !! | Často řidič odmítne jízdu, i již potvrzenou (Ostrava). Čas dojezdu taky nesouhlasí. Při jedné jízdě mi řidič naúčtoval poplatek navíc aniž by mě aplikace upozornila. Poté jsem musel složitě řešit vrácení peněz, namísto toho mi byl vrácen kredit do uber peněženky. | Уважаемый Uber !
Еще раз внесете деньги за отмену вызова в следующий счет, пошлю вас к черту !  
Вы можете увидеть на своей схеме - отмена произошла почти через 20 минут ожидания, вместо обещанных 5-и . Ни ответа на мои звонки , ни на звонок администратора ресторана не было . Если ваш таксист приехал на соседнюю улицу за рестораном, потому что ему так было удобнее, это ваши проблемы !
Такси было заказано на адрес ресторана ( один гость плохо ходит ) и дело не в тех копейках или паре крон, а в принципе !
Иногда заказываешь такси, потому что нагружена покупками и не собираешься бегать за ним, в поисках удобной для таксиста остановки . 
Рекламация по поводу водителя , который не приехал 8.11.2023 к ресторану Gran cru “ Lodecka 4, Praga .
Свидетелей  тому - 3 гостя и администратор ресторана . | Perfect | V poslední době se mi 2x stalo ze jsem objednal jízdu , řidič jízdu přijal , mel přijet za par minut - najednou tato informace zmizela a objevil se v aplikaci jiný řidič který přijede třeba za 20-25 minut. V prvním případě jsem Uber jízdu zrušil pro příliš velké čekání ,a jel jinou společnosti ,  včera jsem si holt těch 22 minut na chodníku počkal . 
Nezdá se mi ti fér , natož když jsem ještě v tom prvním případě zaplatil cca 70 Kč za zrušení te jízdy . | 👍 | Moc děkujeme!Vlak jsme stihly díky Vám | Děkuji za příjemné svezení 😘 pan řidič byl strašně fajn a auto bylo perfektně čisté a voňavé🙌🏻 | Rychlá reakce a přijel i přes krátkou vzdálenost jízdy. Moc děkujeme ;) | Pan ridic byl jeden z nejslusnejsich, ktere jsem u Uber poznal. Dekuji.

A to jsem klientem několik let. Ale aktualizace nejde. A stará verse se vymazala. 
Co teď? | Нуждае се от ъпгрейд!При регистрация има проблем с микрофона на видеото за удостоверение(при Андроид работи)! | Great app for traveling across the world and easy manipulation with your money. | Při registraci neustálá hláška o problému s mikrofonem,prostě nelze registrovat | Poplatky za krypto nejsou 0,49% ale 2% | After last update I cannot open this app !!!! Please make something with this!!! | 4-5 days for The easy transfer of my money from one bank to other is so long! BR Robert | Nejvetsi podvodnici!

Nakoupite kryptomenu, ale uz ji nevyberete, protoze za vyber zaplatite minimalne 1£ a to u vsech uctu.

 Zkuste potom koupit 1 vrstvu, kde se vam castka rozlozi do 20ti kryptomen a kazdou z nich potom musite(!) vybirat zvlast za zmineny poplatek, protoze koupit je lze dohromady(samozrejme za dalsi poplatek nekolika dolaru nebo liber), ale prodat musite kazdou zvlast! | It keeps crashing after the latest update. I can’t acces my money no more. | Great! Love It and recommend! | I wish all bank apps were like Revolut. | Perfekt! | Spokojenost, rychlé převody, snadné ovládání, okamžitá zpětná vazba, vysoké zabezpečení👍 | Více služeb kolem kryptoměn
A více možnosti v češtině, zákaznická telefonní linka pro Čechy | Try cancelling your account. Good luck. Will never use and never recommend to anyone exept for my enemies. | After the last update it requires setting a stronger code... But I don't want a new code and now I can't get to the money... I already have a code-protected phone, why do I have to protect the apps too? It doesn't make sense... | Vyborně funguje a splnuje vse co ma 👌.  Splnuje vse co jsem cekal a pouzivam skoro dne pri cestovani. Funguje zatim bez problemu 🙏🏻 | Using Revolut for years, very satisfied with all the features. | Když se revolut rozhodne že si musíš změnit kód tak si ho musíš změnit, není jiná volba. Jděte do prdele… | Všechno se mi líbí , jen bych ještě vylepšil to , aby šlo z normálního účtu poslat peníze na Revolut i o výkendu . Jinak max spokojenost… | Mám plán Metal, obchoduji akcie i krypto a jsem naprosto spokojený. Nejlepší kurzy na výměnu Eura jsou jen třešničkou na dortu. | Amazing tactic to offer monthly plans, which are yearly plans with different payment schedule. The support response is the expected generic stuff “in the terms you received”, yes, I never said it was illegal, just scummy | Application allows you to choose only 6 digit passcode instead of more safer option! | For money conversion OK. But when you want investing to any opportunity, you must pay very high fees | Dobrý den.
Nevím proč mne žádá aplikace o DIČ když nejsem podnikatel a žádné DIČ nemám.
Jestli je tomu tak tak Revolut je k ničemu když se na základě neposkytnutí Daňového identifikačního čísla omezí služby. | Provize nebyla připsána na můj ucet za získání nového klienta . Jinak jsem spokojen a některé QR kódy nejdou přečíst takže nelze platit zejména zahraniční platby . | Analytické nástroje jsou super. Je super, že bylo přidáno budgetování i pro sdílené účty. 

Pointy ke zlepšení:
- u sdileneho uctu nelze zmenit kategorii transakce (sakra proc??)
-  ocenil bych možnost vyloučit z analýzy celou kategorii (převody, zejména ty mezi osobním a společným účtem).
- chybi mi widget, kde hned na domovské obrazovce uvidím kolik mám utraceno z budgetu. Překvapuje mne, že něco takového ještě není k dispozici. | Notice dodgy fintech app, bad support, high risk of los | Jsem naprosto spokojen. Ucet mi ušetřil spoustu nákladů na konverze, kurz je opravdu dobrý, výběry z bankomatů kdekoli pak vůbec nebolí. | The Revolut is fraudulent company! I absolutely dont recommend it! They stole me 10.000 CZK (500 USD). You cant do nothink with them. You can just chat and chat again. They still wrote me just wait and wait. They have my money on intermediary accont a month and still lie to me. I think it will be soon THE NEXT BIGGEST FRAUD LIKE WIRECARD! OMG ! | Služby banky jsou dobré, nicméně neustálé ""vylepšování"" aplikace ji činí hůře použitelnou. Dříve byla jednoduchá a přehledná, nyní už v rámci pokroku je nepřehledná, slučuje někteté kategorie dohromady, přístup k některým funkcím se skrývá v různých podmenu, ap. Za mě 👎 palec důle.
Měním hodnocení na jednu hvězdu. Čím delší dobu jsem nucen používat nový vzhled, tím více mám pocit, že si vývojáře revolutu najmula konkurence k jeho zničení. Nebo si z nás dělají srandu. | best bank | Aunque no están en todas las regiones es una excelente alternativa para muchos países | I have been using revolut and paying premium for couple of years, everything was perfect. However new design has changed a lot, app was very easy to use and now new perks & graphics are overwhelming. I had an option to keep old interface for couple of months and now it’s gone. New complicated interface became mandatory. Please give us an option to keep an old interface still. Thanks! | But the old UI was much better. | Hi, can you fix problem with audio! 

Every time I use the App it turn off background music I listen to:( Why do you do this?:) | Revolut je Top👍🏻 | Revolut makes Banking super simple fast and easy | Mínusy:
- nezobrazuje se číslo účtu, jen nějaká přezdívka, kterou lze změnit maximálně 2x. 
- pořád posílají ověřovací SMS
- úvodní stránka je chaotická sociální síť, ne přehledný bankovní účet

Výhody:
Rychlé založení přímo v aplikaci, virtuální jednorázové karty. | Perfektní aplikace, za pozváni dalších přátel dostanete peníze za určitých podmínek, nejlepší jsou ale virtuální a jednorázové karty. Revolut doporučuju | Size of appliaction is almost 0,5GB :( | Cannot log in with my Apple or Google account. Cannot register because when I pick my adress, it will result in errror. Sorry but did someone tested this? | Takové úroky na spořicích účtech v EUR a USD vám žádná česká banka nenabídne. | Best “bank” if you need to operate with more than one currency - best transfer rates possible - just be carefull only on weekdays - on weekends you pay 1% | I have made account, but every time I tried to get to the app when I wanted to allow notifications I got the “something went wrong” error I have this issue for few months already I wrote email but I got no answers from revolut. | Great Exchange rates. Everything works as it should so far no problems | Great app! But first it is a great service, once you are traveling.

The interface was friendly and nice, thought can’t put same characteristics about the service. I was buying tickets from Prague to Vienna, i was surprised that in application i can’t choose sits even though i was buying first class with and paying for sits. I was assuming that this option will be available during the payment, i selected that we want to be sit near the window as preference. But after that no sit choosing, It didn’t give me such option even after i paid, so i wrote to support team because me and my fiancé were sat separately. They told me that they can’t do any changes in sittings and our tickets can’t be changed or refunded. But we can come on the train and agree with other passengers if they are willing to change places. So basically you would need to buy new tickets. Then i went to website of Czech Railways and there you could choose sits even before you paid, and tickets in 1st class cost 100 euros less!!! I was very upset so i would recommend people - if you want to chose sits better use different companies or applications and check the market wisely | The transit time between our booked tickets were so short that when our first train had a slight delay, we missed the rest of our trains and there was no refund or any help to book a substitute ticket. Very dissappointed. | No idea what have I done wrong but the app says it’s unable to accept my payment even if my card detsils are filled corectly. And it work on laptop websites. Otherwise, I love this app, makes my traveling around the UK way too easier. | I don t have any problem with this app... | This app works really well

I can’t delete my older pins (it works fine with the newer ones), when i click the button “Delete This Pin” it just bugs and i have to restart the app. Please fix it, i really need to delete my older pins. Thank you!! | The app isnt working. Trying to log in “ERROR” blah blah blah. Tried reinstalling it, restarting my phone, reconnecting wifi, NOTHING WORKED! Fix this issue | nejde mi tam přihlásit ale vůbec nejde! | Jsem nadsena z pinteresu❤️💐👍 | I em preppy sooooo preppy photos catch mine eye🪞🧉🐆 | Pinterest одна из моих любимых программ, мне все тут нравится. Но маленький минус что получается сохранить в галерею толком фотки а не видео. A так pinterest просто прекрасен 🤍🤍. | please make it possible to delete the message I sent because I keep accidentally sending people the photo I save | I’m 15 and when i write my birthday it says i’m too young :( | Skvělá aplikace s bezva nápady | Unfortunately you made the app unusable by placing a video ad on every “page” of the feed. Basically I cannot concentrate on the images displayed because there is always some video playing. So I don’t use this adware anymore. | 100% OK | Pinterest us telling me that “looks like your not eligible to join at thismoment though im old enough and i have been trying this for months pls help | Uz nekolik mesicu se snazim prihlasit ale porad to nejde vzdy me to zastavi u veku at tam dam cokoliv stejne me to nepusti dal | Naprostá spokojenost | Best searching results | Pěkne | Pinterest please fix your widget it looks horrible with the frame around the picture make it how it was before - without the frame and the picture was filing out the whole widget 
Thank you | This is the best pinterest | Boykisser | Hello, after the new update my Iphone has on my pinterest boards these weird borders which should be fixed. | i love pinterest but in the newest update there are borders around homescreen edges and its really not a good update, please atleast give us an option to choose if we wang the borders or not | Děkuju za skvělou aplikaci plnou úžasných nápadů….🥰😁👍 | Už | Od doby co mám Pinterest, tak se nenudím a naopak mě hrozně baví hledat že světa nejen fotky, obrázky, recepty, nápady a krásy přírody na naší planetě. Doporučuji všem co hledají různé oblasti poznávání z celého světa. Zábava a ponaučení zaručeno. | Pinterst mám velice ráda. Některé rady nestojí za nic. U vtipných a veselých obrázků mi vadí jejich vulgárnost. Sprosté vyjadřování pisatelů textu.  V celku hodnotím, pro mne, jako skvělou zábavu po večerech. Jsem ráda že jsem ho objevila. jz | Please pin (or add an option in settings to pin) the top tab. I can’t use Pinterest as the tab constantly going up and down is too distracting. Thank you. | Je napsáno od 12+ já tam dám 1986 a ono mi to napíše:„jejda zdá se že zatím nemůžete Pinterest používat”🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 | Love Pinterest so much inspiration❤️🤩 | Hey, I love this app and I’m nonstop on it. The actualisations are pretty good but could you please bring watch back? I’m bored without it. Thank you | I always put in my birthday (2001) but it always says that im too young to join pinterest even though its 12+ | I have problems with registration, every time I try to register, I enter my email, password, name and date of birth, but on the page where the name and date of birth are listed, it always says Oops! It looks like you can't use Pinterest yet. I'm asking for advice, because I've already tried almost everything | So like kolizanka-Tvoua said the thing about Ukraine, I am Ukrainian and I support Ukraine 🇺🇦 so I mean cool app but … yeah | ve sve krystslicke podobe. Mit neco spolecneho s touto ""sluzbou"", radeji si strcim drat do oka. Rychle pryc | I love this app so much, but I got an inappropriate ad so I fixed my age to be accurate. (13) Immediately, my account on which I worked SO HARD on my boards got deactivated, so I have written an appeal and that got declined. The thing is, you state in the Terms & Policy that as long as I have my guardians approval, I may use this app. This means consent from me is obviously unnecessary, therefore I may be below the age of consent in my country, which I am. The issue is I have never gotten a chance to show my guardians approval or even their ID or birth certificate. This means you deactivated my account and didn’t follow your terms. | Na domovske strance se mi ukazujpu veci ktere nechci (nikdy jsem je nevyhledaval a nedal do pinu) ani jsem tam nemel zadny piny ktery by byli podobny😡 | Vůbec nejde stáhnout:( | Pokoušela jsem se přihlásit různými způsoby a porad to nejde i když mi už bylo 13 tak fakt nevim co tomu je dávám 1 hvězdičku protože míň nejde | Je to opravdu super stránka 😉 | Малюю і брав референси, постійно пхали серед картинок полуголих дівчат (нетак щоб постійно але періодично як рекламу) зберів в скриту папку для малюнків бан. Збочений застосунок. Зробіть щоб взагалі не було ні купальників ні дівчат з пляжів! | Your Pinterest is on 12+ and Im 30 and Its not working whats that | Dobrý den,
stáhla jsem si Pinterest a stále mi to ukazuje stejnou chybu když se chci zaregistrovat. Prý že „jsem moc mladá” i když dám jakýkoliv rok. Poté jsem to zkusila na Googlu a stále nic. Nevím jestli je to chyba v telefonu či s aplikací kvůli tomu to musím ohodnotit takhle špatně. Dalo by se to nějak vyřešit? Nebo kde by jsem se při nejhorším mohla ozvat? Děkuju mockrát za pochopení a přeji hezký zbytek dne. | Strasne se seka. Nepomuze ani restart. Zustane na jednom obrazku a nelze s tim hnout,plati pro ""domecek"". Jinak ostatni funguji. | Even though other apps are working just fine I can not open Pinterest. It always announces problem with internet- Wi-Fi on, data on it doesn’t work. Delete and upload app again also doesn’t help. Have this thing lasting months… | This has become an app of adds with some content thrown in here and there.

Jako turistum nam chybela moznost navigace (telefon mit v ruce je hloupost) a cena za 20min jizdy v hodnote 24h jizdenky na mestskou hromadnou dopravu je taky dost úlet. Najít ceník před jízdou se nepodařilo. Nicméně, appka fungovala OK, scootry se načetly a rozjely bez problèmu, takže tohle klaplo a peníze alespoň utraceny user friendly.😅 Příště ovšem raději metrem🙃 | Engone wasn’t starting and ride was kinda I able to finish. | The app never works, looses signal etc. I don’t use Like scooters or bikes anymore. | I have been using this app everyday to get around Prague for the past year, but with the last update of “ride passes” got totally useless and it’s just money for nothing at this point. I’m really mad and never using this again. #BringBackOldPass | Hledal jsem hodinu misto, kde to muzu zaparkovat. Toto je smlouva s dablem!!!! | Great expierence, Good price, it was fun | The worst aplication I ever had. I ride only 5 minutes, and than I tried 20 minutes to stop my ride. It took me 140 czech crowns from my apple pay account. I have very bad experiencies with that. In the application isn't also any contact, when I need advice. | Už mě začíná vysírat,pokud mi kolobezka bráni v mé práci…mohu ji zahodit ? Nebo jak ? | This app is an absolute scam. I wouldn’t ever pay over 800 for this crap ever again. | its seen parking spot randomly, but most often isnt seen that. Support isnt telling true (when i had broken vehicle, that was counted with full price). | Po jízdě nešlo zaparkovat ani na místě pro parking. Podařilo se až po několika minutách, takže jsem byl okraden. V aplikaci není ani žádná podpora která by to vyřešila. Takže NEDOPORUČUJI | Rather take a taxi next time | Charged for one minute as my destination was in the no go zone, i couldnt have used the scooter. The problem was the app didn’t show any map and didn’t show the no-go zones. Clearly fault of the app. Do not download Lime, the app is bad and the service is costly compared to the competition. | Neukazuje cenu nikde v appce ani na stránkách. Pokud člověk jede dál než 300m, vyplatí se jakýkoliv taxík. | Fookin terrible | Super | expensive, no monthly packages, cant park anywhere I want you must find parking spot for your scooter and it will take you lot of time, lot of time you are paying for | It’s not even possible to cancel subscription.
If you want to delete your account you can just write an email to them. 
Even if you change credit card they send you email every day to put another payment method. I just wish I never install that. Worst experience. | Není možné spustit jízdu ani pres ti, ze je zadaná i ověřena platební karta. Jízdu nelze dopustit. | 🤗👍 | Thanks to GPS limitations I was not able to get home. Service is also overpriced... | I didn’t want to subscribe and even didn’t have the app on my phone when money were taken from my card. Moreover, it takes money even if scooter doesn’t work | Good | Super jízda na kolobrnde. Mám zážitek | Jo dobry | They sent me a notification that they would take a specific amount of money and refund me after the ride but they never did so they ended up taking a lot of money because I didn’t notice | 20 Kč/km is the Summer 2022 Price.
5 km around 105 Kč | I found a scooter in the river, I updated the application to notify technical support, but there is no way to contact technical support in the application.  let it lie further.

(50.0847392, 14.4134677) | Líbí se mi pohotovost a vstřícnost této služby . Pokazde se mi snažili vypomoct skrz podporu , kterou jsem zkontaktovala. Stalo se mi to už několikrát. A též musimpozitivně  ohodnotit slevu v rámci kompenzace . | Velmi kavalitni stroj | These guys charge you without permission! Check the reviews here - most of them are 1. And they still use bots to keep the 4.9 rating. The support chat crashes every time I choose the illegal payment | Byli sme v jednosměrné a dostali vynadano od hlavního organa jinak super | Koloběžky v Brně jsou v naprosto tristním stavu. | Drunk tourists on Lime crashed my car. Very irresponsible approach. | I was not able to end ride anywhere near my destination. No parking limitation visible in the app, tried several places where these scooters park regularly to no avail. Had to ride back to the city centre and get a Bolt. Wasted time and money. To add insult to injury, I found a Lime blocking my driveway today. My driveway is less than 100m from a designated scooter parking, where I was not able to park less than 24hours earlier. Can’t reach anyone to remove it. Also twice as expensive as a Bolt. | worst experience ever, the speed limit was all the time at 5 km/h so I have had to bounce all the time. after bouncing back to the spot where i started the prize was 141 crowns. don’t even register! | Nevím jestli se to někomu stalo ale už mi bylo odečteno touto firmou více peněz než mělo a proto raději nedoporučuji… sice je to škoda protože přístroje jsou v ranci možnosti super, ale jde o ty peníze které si účtující aniž by to byla skutečnost. Být těmi kteří jezdili poslední dny na nich, zkontrolujte si platby zda vám nevzali víc než by měli. | After recent update apple pay stopped working, credit cards stopped working... So i have a debt i cannot pay... 🤦‍♂️ | 1. Map works really bad mostly. You could not see the zones for parking or free bikes. (Recommended restart is not helpful)
2. QR codes are not fitting with the vehicle in front of you so often…
3. Price- same time and same way= others 50% cheaper. 
4. Chat? Chat bot? Nothing like that. 
When you write them in app nothing happen. 
5. No money back. Never. Phone? Nowhere. Solving problems? No. | Fix your app or at least give heads up that its not working in the ui | When I lend scooter the app charged me 1€ bill (It was Ok i knew about it) but after that scooter randomaly disconected from the app and stopped. I nearly fell. The app charged me 3€ for 60 meters of road. I thing it’s a lot. I will probably never use this service again | První jizda a hned nefunkční plin odrážel jsem se asi 50m a strhli my cca 50kč 🤣 | Scooters not properly maintained, I got one without wheels and ruined my shoes | They reserved my money and they never send my money back. Also it’s not simple. I wanna delete my account but I need to do some papers. I HATE THIS APP PLEASE DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS. | Ukazuje kde jsou tyhle odrážedla, ale ani jedno nikde není 😭 | Too expensive.

I would really appreciate if you could change that. Thank you so much. | It feels like google has completely lost its ability to design anything useful. From removing maps from web search, to the weird email sign in redesign, to removing the shopping tab to this weird update its as if their design team is on a mission to completely ruin their users experiences. Bizarre | Špatná orientace navigace a nefunkční nebo chybně určená místa na časové ose | Hlasova navigace se seka a povely nestihne rici do konce a utne je v pulce slova. iOS ma v kombinaci s googlem tolik chyb,ze je to az trapne | Chybí mi nastavení, ve kterých zemích chci platit mýto nebo dálnice a kde ne. Naštěstí to umí Seznam mapy. | Some tram route maps are not the newest, please review it 🙏🏻. 
Sofia tram map route -
Zagreb (only one visualized on the map) 2024 March | Špatný signál | After update, google maps offers to use taxi or flix bus but not the normal transport (tram, buses, subway). There is a big bug. Fix it! | “Add stop” function removed👎👎👎 | Stále nefunguje!! Už třetí měsíc ukazuje chybu ať zkusím později!!!!!! | grafiku map navrhoval někdo s distanční výukou protože nechápu jak tohle někdo mohl pustit do světa...Nebýt historie polohy letí pryč i tahle jediná apka od Googlu. Navigace strašná  UI tragické...na seznam mapy se podívejte jak to má vypadat | Jsem velice spokojený.Mrzí, že mě zmizelo počet zhlédnutí mých fotografií.Bylo to dobrá pobídka udělat další fotky. | But I am, and not just me, missing the functionality to display total km/miles a trip would take when there's multiple stops along the route. | Absolutly The best app for traveling.

Thank you for that | Atop updating the app always i hate it i open it and everytime it says i have to update it like its so annoying and there are no bugs so idk why are you updating it | Všechno je na míru přesně
Není nic lepšího | Yes goood | Mapy jsou super , až na 1 chybu, ktera mi vadi: Když plánuji trasu a přidám zastávku, tak mi aplikace neukáže kolik km trasa měří, pouze čas. Při plánování bez zastávky km vidět jsou. Bylo by možné toto opravit? Dodnes neopraveno - pridavam dalsi chybu - rychlostni limity jsou spatne nastaveny , ukazuji spatnou max rychlost na mnoha usecich. Dalsi poznatek- navigace je velmi spatna. Svede mne z dalnice bez jakehokoliv duvodu. Děkuji | Barevné schéma je příšerné. Odpudivé nepřehledné barvy. Snazim jsem se to přežít. Ale pak mě začali google mapy najednou posílat objizdkama a dalšíma cestami mimo přímou cestu po dálnici. A to bohužel pořad. Je jedno jaký je tam provoz. Doba cesty se tím natahla o 20%. Je naprd jezdit podle mapy které nemůžete věřit. 

Prechazim na jinou navigaci. | When adding a stop while driving - no way to see ETA. When using public transport confusing to see departure time of next transfer. Getting more and more confused. | Mohu doporučit..ochotně mi poskytli info o výrobcích, které jsem potřebovala. Díky. A. M. | The application requests accessing the whole library to upload just a single photo. It ignores the limited subset and insists on access all photos and videos in the device. | Stále nějaké aktualizace, které nikam nevedou . | constant rejection of reviews in businesses where I am basically everyday | We need more contrast! | This design forced me to swtich to apple maps.
I like your inclusive decision to make the maps unusable. | Jsem moc rád, že mohu bezplatně využívat Google mapy. Moc děkuji 🙂 | uninstalled. | Very convenient program | Nove barevne schema je neprehledne. Oznaceni dalnic zelenou a jeste k tomu tlustou carou? Jako vazne? | Kdysi to byvaly nejlepsi mapy k navigaci, bohuzel posledni dobou stale casteji nabizi pro jizdu autem podivuhodne trasy skrz zakazy vjezdu, nesjizdne cesty, zavrene zavory na lesnich cestach atd. Posledni hrebicek do rakve je ovsem nedavna zmena designu, ktery je absolutne katastrofalni. Nevyrazne nekontrastni barvy rafinovane skryvaji dulezite hlavni silnice a znemoznuji snadnou a rychlou orientaci nejen pri jizde autem. Nedokazu pochopit, kde vznikla potreba prijit s novym designem, kdyz stary perfektne vyhovoval pro dany ucel. Timto krokem se mapy bohuzel staly zcela nepouzitelne a nuti me najit jinou alternativu pro navigaci. Jedina varianta, jak zachovat pouzitelnost aplikace, by byla ponechat uzivatelum moznost prepnout na stary design mapy a pevne verim, ze se vyvojari probudi zpet do reality a tuto moznost pridaji! At uzivatele ukazou, ktery design bude oblibenejsi. | New desing is very bad. | Low contrast, less pleasant colors, less intuitive 

Please, let people choose what colour scheme to use | I don’t really like the latest update with the changes to the look of the map. Makes it hard to find things. | Člověk píše ve svém volen čase a zdarma recenze na místa kam chodí, dělá fotky, hodnotí spravedlivě a oni mi zablokují účet, matkou hodnocení co se jim nelíbí (5 hvězd i 1 hvězdu). Přecházím na jiné mapy! | Google mapy jsem pouzival ne kvuli funkcnosti, ale protoze byly alespon pro mne, prehlednejsi nez konkurencni apk. Ale poslednu aktualizace me vytocila! Proc nekdo saha do neceho, co funguje? Co to je za hrozny barvy? Splyva to dohromady a nemam v aute cas to lustit. Prosim, vratte nam nase prehledne barvy a vyhodte toho grafika, co ten novy vzhled prosadil! | The app is a great navigation app but why did they have the need to change the look of the map? The colours are horrible and I hate using it when it looks like this | The colors are awful since several versions back. With this version, they got even more awful! Unbelievable... | I have noticed a change in design of the maps. It became worse. It used to be perfect but now it’s meh. Please create an option for people to be able to take the previous design back | Pokaždé. Ale opravdu pokaždé, když potřebuji službu mapy skrz vyhledávač, vždy je nová aktualizace. Je hezké, že se o mapy starají, ale co z toho, když se pak nedají používat. | Chtěl bych jen navrhnout. Může někdo kontrolovat výslovnost hlasové navigace? Protože když Vám říká odbošte do leva. Tak vám to zůstane v hlavě hodně dlouho. Mohl by to někdo zkontrolovat a opravit. Děkuji. | Chucpe firma Google nedovoluje záporné recenze za úplatu! Za to kdysi zemřel Jan Hus! Styďte se! | Velmi se mi nelibi poslední aktualizace . Mapa je nepřehledná a je potřeba velkého přiblížení, aby byla vidět doprava na silnicích nižší třídy. | Well the new design of the default map is honestly awful. | New colors are terrible. | Aplikaci jako takovou cením a má vše co potřebuji, ale nejnovější vzhled / podoba map je katastrofa!!! Nechápu jak si někdo mohl říct jo to je to co potřebujeme novou VŮBEC ale vůbec nepřehlednou mapu.  Stary vzhled byl mnohem lepší! Řiďte se heslem ""funguje to? NESAHEJ NA TO!!!!! | Po dnešní zkušenosti navigovani kdy měla ušetřit nějaký čas navigovala tak vymrdane a zkurvene ze z bodu kde jsem sjel z dálnice mě nevedla z5 a ještě mě kus vrátila?! To jako vážně? Vývojáři by zasloužili poradně přes držku nájezd km na víc  a místo 1h ztráty 2h navigace roku celej Google  ať táhne do pici svy mámy!!!! | I guess Google gets paid a lot of money to prevent poorly rated businesses to be filtered out by maps users.
I some locations I still see 1.6 star restaurants even if I select 4.0 stars and about in the filter.
This is quite low! | Nechápu, proč když si na internetu najdu místo kam potřebuji navigovat, tak aplikace potřebuje aktualizovat při každém vyhledávání.. už mě to fakt sere… dělejte s tím něco … iphone 13 mini… | The Google Times widget has disappeared again.

Materials will drop you from traina exactly to miss some material to give you chance to buy material for real money. RNG In match minigame is done to frustrate you to miss just one move and suddenly it says to buy 5 more moves with real money. Yeah I know it's ""normal"" on mobile but I played many mobile games and this one is just aggressive with build-in mechanics to take money from you | Děkuji za tuhle hru docela si ji užívám protože my je 8 | You can make anything with town | Moje nejoblíbenější hra je fakt skvělá hraju ji už rok vkuse | Very very grate game | Líbí se mi, že můžu budovat město. 
Město dle svých představ. | Skáče mi tam furt hodnocení, tak hodnotim. | Nedokážete odpovědět ani pomoct!!! | Literally it’s everywhere and it’s so annoying | Hra mě ze začátku nadchla ale jen do chvíle kdy mi začalo docházet místo, nemůže sklidil pole, naplnit vlak nic… pořad upgrade a já do toho odmítám dávat další peníze !!! Hru jsem smazala !!! Proto dávám hodnocení takové jaké je !!! | Best app! | I have been playing the game for about 5 years and in the last two years you have started giving much worse events. why can't there be cooking or airplanes or something that people enjoy and not keep changing the same 3 events. Please answer, I really miss the old township. | Game its fun and all, but you can only hope nothing bad happens, because boy, customer service is useless bunch;) | Very good weter | Quite a good game although it gets a little repetitive after a while… | Čeština chybí Škoda jinak super | I really like the game but since the last update my bees have been buzzing ALL the time, not only when I enter the apiary. I think there is something wrong. The other animals do their sound only when I am in their homes but I can hear the bees everywhere...in different places in my town, during renovations and even in the games.... ALL THE TIME!!! I tried to turn the sound off but then I cannnot hear the other sounds.
Is it only my problem (maybe with my phone) or does this problem have other players too? | Sounds good so far.I am at the beginning but very intuitive. | Je to super hra ,až na to že tam máte pořád jen colourful puzzle a málo peněz můžete si vytvořit město snů.Tak do toho! | Po 151. aktualizuju Township je to dobrá hra až na aktualizace

Za mě dobré výjimkou jsou aktualizace.! | Mega v pohode hra mužů doporučit | Really good game love it | Dear creators! This is very annoying to put the Golden ticket offer to every pop up window in the game.I play this game maybe five years ant this is too much already. Maybe you think we are blind?? Also I dont understand why in Regatta we have the same tasks every week when there is so many factories and crops. | Super hra | Its so boring i hate it! Ad is so much better!! This is only about farming and this game gonna take me all my time!!

Something vibrating inside mechanism of my phone, no vibration itself but something inside the phone. It started about 2weeks ago and it is happenning only when I play this game. Despite I love the game. As my son says I am addicted to it. | Když jsem hru začala hrát, byla super. Nevadilo mi ani občas vývojářům zaplatit….ale poslední rok je hra jen o tom neustále do hry dávat skutečné peníze…..kdyby ale alespoň vývojáři z Playrix-u za to vraceli adekvátní  služby. Po 3 letech přestávám hru hrát tak intenzivně a budu čekat, jak se to bude dál vyvíjet… bohužel i dlouholetí “TOP” hráči jsou naštvaní a uvažují o ukončení. Pokud jste ochotni do hry dávat skutečné peníze (jinak si pořádně nezahrajete) jděte do toho. Pokud ne, možná by bylo vhodnější se poohlédnout po jiné hře…. | Its a good game but i spend a lot of my real money and i dont wanna have no money. So i uninsaleted that game. And can somebody tell me why you have to wait a lot? For STUPID tomato you have to wait a 1 hour or for plane you have to wait a 14 hours  or maybe more. Thank you and im not gonna install this game ever again… | It is the great relaxing game I ever used to resting 👍 | Skvělá a záživná hra, obzvlášť ve skvělém týmu na týmové hry 🙂 | Moc baví. Doporučuju. | Ігра дуже класна | Hra je perfektní ale ještě by se to mohlo rozšířit  o tu skalu. Aby se třeba ty farmáři mohli spojit jako velké hospodářství a město.  Ale jinak je to oddechovka,zatím nejlepší farma co hraju  👍👍👍👍 | Žádné minihry hraji už rok a měla jsem na začátku jen jednu minihru jako upoutávku takže to co je v reklamě celkově nečekejte ale jinak super hra co zabaví | I so love this game but those mini games are totally awful for example those explosive renovations after you barely finish one hard level comes another very hard and takes you at least 3 days to pass them unless you use real money to buy tools. So many events I am just skipping because they are too stressful to pass. I am playing over 200 days in a raw and I have lvl 63 please do something with that! | Moc dobra hra | Super uncreative with every single event, not original, poorly developed, super boring, bad rewards. Pretty bad over all. | No | Zaplatila jsem si Gold ticket za 129,- Kč,peníze fuč!!!!!! A vůbec se mi neotevřel Gold ticket!!!!

But since months it has change. These mini games make no fun anymore. First of all it‘s only 3 games around and around and even then it‘s almost impossible to win something… i was buying me often golden pass, but that’s over now when i know that i can‘t reach any nice prices… please do something about it, bring snowboard ride again, cutting fruits, explore islands.

We’ve been busy improving the game and addressing bugs for you. 
Enjoy!","2.12.532",0,"CZK",true,520119067,"Magmatic Games Ltd","https://apps.apple.com/cz/developer/magmatic-games-ltd/id520119067?uo=4","https://www.moonactive.com",4.76678,"I would looove this game if it wasnt for the stupid stamina…. Once I ran out there was an option to buy 25 stamina by watching an ad but then that option disapeared…. I could really play this game for hours, because i like that the merge is not restricted to just one game or level but another thing that pisses me off is when i do run out of stamina i have to click X on like 5 ads to buy it with real money (but What sane person would do that) | Afterast update i am stuck in loading on 35% and can not finish start game. | I totally love it | I really don't know what kind of game you guys are making. The benefits are terrible. The activities give you some gold coins or two diamonds, but nothing else. There are a lot of things at level 11. Do you really think this is fun? Take a look at the game Seaside Escape. Their game stamina is free of charge, and the activity benefits are 100 times better than yours. They also have a small box that gives you a level 7 item if you click on it, and you can get 38 boxes every Friday. My level there is already 140, and I played the game half a year later. It’s really funny. This game not only requires an Internet connection to play, but also requires krypton gold. It's amazing, I've never seen such a crappy game. In the past, the Internet was not required, but now it is mandatory. | I really enjoy this game, it is addictive, but the emount of energy is a joke, it allows me to play for 5-10 minutes and then i have to wait for another 3-4 hours to have my energy replenish fully, it is really annoying. I already purchased more energy for diamonds but that is also a small amount that can be used, i also purchased for my own money (which i cant do indefinitely). 

So maybe adding more energy or more chances to win energy (maybe some minigames included in the game) would be really apreciated. | It is definetely best game I know though rewards could be more generous. One needs 700 energy to fulfill a task. Daily payment is a need | Love to play it everyday. | Hra byla fakt super ale od poslední aktualizace je to katastrofa.
Denní výzva jde splnit pouze s tím že si člověk koupí !! nesmyslně drahé balíčky 😡😡
Úkoly jsou poslední verze náhodných věcí, takže po splnění poslední verze veze klauna dostanete opět poslední verzi, což znamená několikrát počkat na doplnění energie a stále nemáte jistotu, že úkol splníme 😡😡

Pokud chcete hrát hru kde musíte neustále kupovat balíčky za 500 Kč/20€
Aby jste splnili aspoň dva úkoly denně tak OK ale jinak raději smazat a hrát od jiných firem. | It was very nice and enjoyable game until you started raising the orders and prices and making the cards collection impossible. I was playing every day and now I didn’t open it for a month. Good luck with bankruptcy. | Hra mě velmi bavila, ale teď po aktualizaci velká katastrofa a velké zklamání. | Velice dobrá hra, do té doby, než začali být vývojáři chamtiví, změnili odměny a nutí Vás utratit čím dál víc peněz.
Už to za to ale nestojí… | If you want to fully play and complete the challenges, it will cost you a lot of money. After the update, the rewards were significantly reduced to just suck money from you. | Od te doby co jsem ucet u hry propojila s facebookem jak jste chteli nefunguje jak ma a to jsem do ni narvala dost penez hned to opravte jsem nastvana | From the start it was a great game and it was okay to spend some money sometimes. But developers make the game not playable without money with every update more and more. So now it is game only for rich people, who doesn’t care about spending a lots of money to complete tasks. | My god, used to be good. I updated it now after while and several minutes in and cant play any cause you force shove ten bilion ads in my face. Is there even game anymore or just commands to go here and go there and follow you there and there and there.. jesus christ, I used to relax playing this. Now cant even get to the game through the utter disrespect to ones time. Terrible to see you doing this to your game. | Good game | I love the way that they will not force the player to watch ad, but let the player choose whether they want to watch the ad or not. | One of the best mobile game on AppStore 
Please add new levels ;) | i like this game  but it is very slow, it gets stuck during individual moves and I have to turn the game off and on several times.  it can't be the phone's memory.  I don't have this problem with other games. | Hello. I also like playing this game. It’s relaxing. But last few days there is something wrong. I have 100 power. When I want to get one thing to make another, game takes me 2 pieces of my power and always was 1 piece. What happend? Is it mistake? :( | worst ad in the world!!  in another game I saw an ad for this game and then I wanted to close the ad using the cross on the top right and it happened that the ad could not be closed.  so that's why the worst game in the world and something else, I had to restart the game I was playing. | Jakmile máte trochu víc diamantů, tak vás aplikace pěkně nutí, aby jste je zase rychle utratili. Najednou je odpočet na věcech ze kterých vypadávají další věci. Takže “urychlete odpočet pomocí diamantů” super věc, předtím jste mohli klidně celých 100 energie využít na jednu věc když jste spojovali. Teď na to tak 3x kliknete a musíte si zase počkat. | Ukazuje to check your internet conection. Internet mám v pořádku. Vůbec to nejde zpustit. 😟 | Je to dobrá hra👍 | I like this game, but one thing i don’t get is why there are so many animal sanctuaries when not even one of them works. Can you finally update the game so it works? Thanks. | Hi | Hru jsem hrála porad, dokud ji nezmenili.  Dřív se vám bubliny měnily na životy. Teď už životy jen tak nedostanete a musíte si je koupit. Akorát z nás chtějí tahat peníze !!! Takže mazu | After latest update my museum audio guide deluxe produces only paintings and not sculptures. My next problem is turning bubbles into coins. They are not turning into energy. | I love this game but this new graphic is just bad, sorry :( | I love this game so much! I have played it for year and half now. It is addiction. 

But one unfinished order botheres me a lot. Its a Mysterious fossil, which I cannot make it. I wish there was a cross button and the order could be canceled. I am level 184 and Mysterious fossil is still there. And on the upper order bar is only three commission and not more, so its sometimes boring. I wish for more orders from people. 

thanks. | Красивая и достаточно интересная игра для любителей жанра, но есть момент, из за которого я больше не хочу в это играть. Задания стали примерно одни и те же. Точек, которые выдают объекты, много. Но задействованы всего несколько. Скучно и однообразно. | I like playing this game, but in last three days sometimes the music in the game starts to play, which I do not like. I have the sound switched off, because I like to play in the bus or train. With the music, which is not possible to switch it off, I cant play, because it annoys other people (and me too). If the developer do not fix it, I’ll stop playing and delete it from my phone. | I play this game for a long time, but sometimes the timing is soooooo boring! 🤦‍♀️ 
I have 4 people waiting and all they need I need to create at 2 poor stations🤷‍♀️ you click 5x here 5x there and bye bye, end. I dont like it. | I cant change language. My game is in korean and i cant find the way to change it into the english…",4.76678,849,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/37/39/d5/3739d51d-5037-8533-668d-b196f6b740b9/e922efb1-f499-434e-aff4-7816575200ff_TRT00291_OriginalSetUp.Update_Merge_1242_2208_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/c7/ea/94/c7ea9459-7640-cea1-dfb4-46094f015c84/d5ea34cf-f365-42e1-98af-fc98c3b2751e_TRT00291_OriginalSetUp.Update_Explore_1242_2208_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b3/7e/c6/b37ec68f-e270-1797-c223-68b93e02c744/62272140-c711-4469-a7f6-8f314ae1df46_TRT00291_OriginalSetUp.Update_Build_1242_2208_EN.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/4a/0c/0e/4a0c0ebb-611f-dd0a-3656-8b8d059c3d58/4e0bbc2e-5b9a-4eb1-ae17-116d295778a9_Copy_of_TRT00310_OriginalSet.GamePlay_Travel_1242_2208.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/da/ac/e5/daace52b-c58d-0c77-9341-a364d260049a/2583cd3e-d5bf-43db-8659-f4d535c36e13_TRT00291_OriginalSetUp.Update_LOGO_1242_2208_EN.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b4/93/ca/b493ca99-7a92-f39e-b693-c8ed9c65fdb9/9a12f870-3cee-42f2-8eeb-3b93a0584388_TRT00291_OriginalSetUp.Update_Merge_2048_2732_EN.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/eb/61/d7/eb61d746-be11-eaaa-536b-94818c1600c0/6e390def-6532-4bb2-8ecb-5ccf0331886b_TRT00291_OriginalSetUp.Update_Explore_2048_2732_EN.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/8c/81/1c/8c811c78-024c-fdb4-8ae8-06de0b998715/9b8d80f7-ba6c-4b1b-ad25-37d1fec54440_TRT00291_OriginalSetUp.Update_Build_2048_2732_EN.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/d8/aa/67/d8aa6780-37b0-56e2-bb50-3ce147b6a201/369df435-902b-4106-b37c-3f751107dd62_Copy_of_TRT00310_OriginalSet.GamePlay_Travel_2048_2732.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/c7/56/ad/c756adc0-e579-f600-5194-3482f4f1296c/f3bf7f21-28f5-4d92-b0c9-a23a9fcc80ea_TRT00291_OriginalSetUp.Update_LOGO_2048_2732_EN.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15

Odkaz v app nefunguje správně. Díky za info | Hratelnost a otázky fajn ale ty dlouhý reklamy jsou opravdu bizár. Horší jak v televizi. | Je to mega super hra na přemýšlení a musí si to vyzkoušet proste každý 👍👍👍😍🥰 | Hra je skvělá, ale reklam je tam nespočet!! 
Až to člověkovi leze na nervy | Já jsem Terka . Baví mě zajímavé hry jakože se dozvím víc takové ponaučné hry a tahle je ta kterou jsem hledala. 

                                                  Děkuji Tereza | Skvělá hra. | Hra super, jen nevím jak přidat nebo najít  přítele :) | Parádní IQ hra, doporučuji, 5 ⭐️ | Od neděle hra mimo provoz je vidět jenom pozadí | Je to strašně naučné | Jak si mohu přidat do přátel nějakého hráče? | Když jsem hrála poprvé nevěděla jsem si rady a teď jsem vyšprtaná jako Einstein ale třeba jsem vůbec nevěděla Že chobotnice má 3 srdce a 9 mozků ohromné! 

              Děkuji moc ❤️ | Hra je super až na ty reklamy během hry😢 | Lehké otázky. Co 3 odpovědi, to reklama. Smazal jsem po 15 minutách. Jinak pěkně udělané. | Zábavné, dobré ale neuvěřitelně přereklamované!!! 2 reklamy za sebou po každých 5 ti otázkách. | Ben | Hra dobrá…ale těch reklam…to tak kazí zábavu…jo, já vím…smolík 😏 | Chápu, že v aplikacích, které jsou zdarma, budou reklamy, ale tady to je extrémně otravné. | Skvělé | Hra pro 4 leté děti | Skvělá aplikace, ale bohužel až moc reklam…a to člověk dost otráví !!! 🥵🥵🥵 | V zásadě fajn, oceňuji komentáře ke každé odpovědi. Na začátku fakt zbytečně primitivní otázky (neodpovídají věku, na který se přitom ptáte..), ale po pár levelech se úroveň zvedne. Máte tam ale jednu velkou CHYBU: Když přijmu souboj, který začne někdo jiný, u každé otázky je tento začínající hráč označen jako nejrychlejší, i když není (což se pozná během načítání odpovědí - kdo už odpovědel a kdo ještě ne - i když odpoví jako poslední, je označen za prvního) a ve výsledku tak samozřejmě vyhraje s plným počtem bodů (110). Zvláštní je, že když začnu já, toto se neděje, hra je spravedlivá. Pevně doufám, že to je jen nějaká chybka v aplikaci a nejsou ty souboje nějak zmanipulované. OPRAVTE TO!! | Úkoly s vyplňováním písmenek nejde plnit. Buď jsou políčka mimo obrazovku nebo chybí písmenka nebo obojí. | Hra mi přijde velice zábavná . Ze začátku mi otázky připadaly vyloženě snadné , ale pak jsem objevil těžší mód a už je to záludné. Jediné  co mi vadí je při soubojích časováni nejrychlejších odpovědí . Záměrně sleduji zobrazení kdo už odpověděl a i ve chvíli kdy jsem označen jako první odpovídající tak získá body někdo jiný . Většinou druhý hráč v dolní liště zleva . | Ty pulminutove reklamy vzdy po minutě jsou opravdu vyborne!!! | Hned prvni reklame jsem hru smazal. SMETACI ODPORNY. To bych si ji radeji koupil , ale tohle je odporny ty REKLAMY | Velké množství reklamy | Each time you’ll achieve something in this game, it rewards you with a long non-skippable ad!! Amazing!! What a great idea!! | Otázky pro děti předškolního věku a co minutu reklama. Nestahujte, je to braindead šmejd. | Ty zku.ve.ý reklamy, nejde to vypnout? | Reklamy, které mají přidat 1 život nepřidávají nic. | Dost dobrý, hraju každý den, to mluví za vše, hlavně online mě baví 👍👍👍 | Dobrý den, 
Moc zajímavá hra velice mě baví děkuji za její stvoření | Asi si na překlad najali studenta druhého ročníku střední školy. 
Nápad zajímavý, ale obtížnost nevyrovnaná a samozřejmě spousta reklam, pokud nezaplatíte. Což neudělám, protože je to odfláknutá práce. | Har vypadá dobře. Ale je tam more reklam a proto mažu!!! | Hra je skvělá jen když dohrání skupinový souboj nic se nestane a musím hru shodit protože z toho nejde vyjet | Dobrý den, hra je super. Jen nevím, jak hrát s přáteli? Klidně nějaký DUEL a podobně. Díky | pac a pusu | Neda se to hrat, vsechny spravne odpovedi jsou stale “A”. Uz ani nemusim cist celou otazku nebo vsechny odpovedi, dam A a je to spravne. Hruza. Prosim, udelejte s tim neco. To neni kviz, ale jenom tupy klikani na Acko. | I like dis game alot | Dobrý den, pekna hra, jen vždy po souboji se mi hra vždy zasekne. :( | Otázky jsou opravdu stupidní, nic nad čím byste museli přemýšlet více jak 3 sekundy.. 
Co 5 minut mi vyskakují otravné reklamy které nejdou ani vykřížkovat a musíte počkat až skončí :))))) | Velmi dobrá hra , doporučuji ✨👍🏻 | Otravna aplikace plna reklam!! | Příliš mnoho reklam | Skvělá hra! Pro mého syna (9let) i poučná. Komentář ke správné odpovědi je skvělý nápad. Reklama nás už neotravuje, za 49 Kč jsem ji vypla. | Perfektní hra, spoustu zajímavých otázek, člověk se toho spoustu přiučí👍 ale! Ty reklamy, to je něco strašného😔 kolikrát mi skočí reklama po dvou otázkách a úplně mi to ztrácí chuť k pokračování.. | Je to super ale věk je asi 7+ | Skvělá hra, jsme s přítelkyní na pivě a slvěle se bavíme!",4.70876,8663,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/5e/3f/2d/5e3f2dcd-42a2-18c6-d0d4-be37f1d3b6ef/56876b2f-4fc7-43ef-a3a1-40fb2ad056d5_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/87/1d/77/871d7799-defe-e7f5-5573-9fae4123ea3c/5c82d27a-4d60-4861-bc39-c87287378a10_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/40/83/92/408392c7-d51c-ceea-9898-335590e44ed3/a94aeb0b-8c8c-431f-99b9-2cf3c16b4ca1_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/6f/fe/96/6ffe96a4-409a-2bf8-ee50-32ab48191a80/a1166ee6-92d5-4a76-898a-74c964f12f18_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/12/7f/83/127f8300-85b0-86ae-b812-a7266ea6e077/ac3517e6-59ea-4acd-b13b-82f741cc2964_05.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/b7/8f/4a/b78f4ae3-cdce-4459-6c78-d343b19cd1e3/70f23945-eafb-4e58-8aeb-fd3ae5708ddc_06.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/f9/c1/9c/f9c19c39-98ab-ed1e-cb52-275d76797fe4/f2817fe1-502a-44f1-b266-f7e18f5501f8_07.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/2e/b6/a3/2eb6a3a5-f127-159f-9f98-c3363083efcc/a95085b4-0a8c-4f5a-81dc-8e6de864abfd_08__U002810_U0029.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/8f/fd/bc/8ffdbc83-95ba-74c5-8fce-12289f599d87/7d5a4857-39c9-422d-8fc0-b82ee62b02b0_09.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/01/a2/e4/01a2e4d8-3da3-4d5c-0149-858dd573659c/d6d9e5cc-234e-4d56-b860-9c5b26791a94_10.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/85/a9/10/85a9101d-bf2b-f087-2d40-adb311addea1/ba147c5b-5858-428f-bcb3-761c3fea978d_01.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/64/fc/c9/64fcc92e-6512-ad9a-9827-1bbb40b94100/18773f85-a24f-4a8b-ac74-52baeeae71da_02.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/b4/c9/b9/b4c9b9ce-b91f-404b-b97f-1c4b9f3c3e29/0d25091e-5f04-434c-95c2-5377672e0cab_03.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/3e/65/da/3e65da55-2298-c7aa-fe1c-fa416a6dffaa/08776388-f434-4b47-8678-5bf54f3bbfd2_04.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/9a/7c/25/9a7c25f8-8801-3e0b-adb2-286afcb573ea/4b581621-7d32-452b-8740-c55062366d7e_05.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/09/6e/e6/096ee647-3856-7691-7949-2214abc1baae/c5ab3a32-6e75-4359-8bb5-4fa4d249fb00_06.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/93/bc/77/93bc771c-36ef-d35c-39c7-b9dec7e3ac93/538cc9cb-6aa5-4987-a3ba-f1e3e5f59edc_07.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple112/v4/80/ff/7d/80ff7d27-ab31-f943-15ac-7ba72e008351/300c4b0b-c595-43dc-b4de-5a35d390decc_08__U00289_U0029.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/ad/fa/ac/adfaacb4-2f69-7f3e-f8d0-11b0f8fe7def/d109f2da-4e32-44b3-8492-f7d2aaf3e675_09.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/2d/9e/b7/2d9eb7d4-2f28-3230-2075-8540f9018f41/1d69a9bd-8a27-4c25-9c34-2ff329f15c59_10.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12

Doporučuji zábavnou formou a jde to | Nejlepší aplikace na naučení jazyků!!!!! | Не працює в 13 айфоні голосове звучання, а на андроїдах все працює. Чому? | Application is forcing to repeating the phrase and words, but is not always comfortable to do and found time, also assistance model is waisted quite a lot of time with all this useless,”-Now is your turn”, “-Follow me”, “-Very good” and cetera. | Лучшее приложение доя изучения чешского, что мы смогли найти | Ok | Bezva aplikace, plné funkcni, bohužel obsahuje chyby v překladech… | Je to skvělá aplikace má více jazyku než třeba duolingo ale obě aplikace jsou dobré ale mluvíme o Mondly. A musím říci ze se s ni hodně naučím. Doporučuji | 😀 | This application is perfect. | Velmi zábavné učení | Ať | Je to super, jeste vcera jsem italsky nerekla ani slovo a dnes uz se predstavim | Zbytečně často se opakují stupidní výrazy jako film-film, tenis-tennis, golf-golf apod.  Zdržuje to a je to nuda. | Mám koupené premium, součástí má být kids v plném rozsahu zdarma a není co s tím?? | Dobře se mi učí | con Mondly hr mehorado mucho mu aprendizaje, cada dia aprendo palabras nuevas y mi prnunciavion es mejo | I don’t know | Příjemné učení, pokud to myslíte vážně a baví vás to :) | Добавьте виджет | Děkuji moc, jsem stará baba, čerstvá důchodkyně, tak se učím a i když si nic nepamatuji, tak mě to baví a doufám, že si začnu pamatovat…😂😂😂👏👏👏 | Absolutely untrustworthy. There are constant ads in which the price is increased tenfold with a 90% discount offer. Absolutely nothing can be trusted with such a company. A solid product is not sold that way. A decent company would never fool customers like that. | Ja uz si ji zaplatila. Lepší aplikaci na učení jazyku by jste těžko hledali. | This app is not worth buying, a lot of mistakes, nobody is reacting to comments. Google translate is on the same level! | Thank you | It is good application, but it will be good to add something like AI chat or another Chatbot which will be practicing language more than this topics (it will be good to add chatbot with normal conversation to practice whole language). I’m studying Spanish and it’s good, but I miss something like virtual friend to practice. | Super aplikace | Trochu to zlobí - u sloves musíte desetkrát napsat zájmeno, třeba ""JÁ jsem"", pojedenácté je v odpovědi jenom ""Jsem""... Vyhodnocuje to jako chybu, někdy i českej slovosled - naskládáte slovíčka do překladu tak, aby to znělo pěkně, a on nepřipustí odchylku v tom, co má předepsaný jako vzor. Nic mě nenapadá přímo z textu, ale něco jako  ""..., zatímco jeho kočka blechy nemá."" Appka vám uzná jako správný jen ""... zatímco jeho kočka nemá blechy"". Teď tam bylo italsky ""Zavíráme v osmnáct (hodin)"", česky byl na výběr jenom ""Zavíráme v šest"", což je ale ve výsledku furt totéž, takže o nic nejde 😀Někdy zlobí v překladu zvratné ""si"" a ""se"",ale to jsou jen takové octomilky, pro mě téměř dokonalej produkt, používám to od září a po pěti měsících mě to neomrzelo. Mluví to, píše to, ukazuje to, vysvětluje to a posunuje to člověka dopředu. Líbí. | Ooo | 🫡 | Konečně aplikace, která dává smysl😉 | Chorvatsky | Superrrr | Za mě zatím nejlepší apka. Nadchla mě možnost si popovídat s UI a procvičit tak i rozhovor. Pro ostýchavé lidi jako já, kdo se zatím stydí mluvit s lektorem ideální věc. | The application, offering a 7-day trial period, extracts payment for the month from the card. Just scammers. I've been using Duolingo for a very long time, no problems. I decided to try your service, I was robbed. | Super aplikace na učení jazyka, je fajn se učit pro jednou jazyk přímo z češtiny. | Naprostá spokojenost | Skvela appka | Super aplikace | Отличное приложение для изучения выбранного для Вас языка !!! | Spokojenost na procviceni slovicek. | It is really nice application for learning languages. It helps me really a lot to improve. The only disadvantage is when I need to write in Kanji, I have to start letters using Katakana so it is not possible to change into Kanji sometimes (not enough letters) - for example ""lake"" みずうみ but kanji is 湖わ . Otherwise I like this app :) | Angličtina mě baví, je to moc hezká aplikace | This application, in more advanced lessons (from around lesson 10), sometimes has problems with accurate translation from Italian to Czech. Despite reporting the issue, there has been no resolution and nothing is being done. | Jsem velmi spokojen | Hned první lekce japonštiny a učí to špatně slovíčka. Nerozlišuje to mladší a starší sestra ani mladší a starší bratr. Hned za startu vás to to naučí používat špatné výrazy. Jinak aplikace vypadá hezky. Ale toto mě odradilo. Učím se Japonštinu od rodilého mluvčí a toto by mě jen mátlo. Škoda. | Špatná zkušenost, zkusila jsem bezplatnou lekci s tím, ze pokud mi nebude vyhovovat, tak se dá lehce zrušit a před každým vystavením faktur budu upozorněna o odečtení peněz. Bohužel se tak nestalo a ani v ochranné lhůtě 14 dni mi nebudou peníze vráceny. | No option to try the app without subscribing

Novou registraci nechci ! | Vždycky  mě u pumpy o slevu odrbou. | It is down when you need it. Not useful at all. | Aplikace nepřehledná, nabídky jsou nezajímavé…. | MOL Move je hravý a nabízí zajímavé ceny i akce, které mají smysl a nejsou ‘stupidní’ jako u jiných firemních aplikací. | your application for the Czech Republic for iOS does not work. After installation 6 months ago it worked crookedly, but now I can’t log into it for 3 months - it loads endlessly. You have to use the site through a browser. | Aplikace je naprosto k ničemu jako pravidelný zakaznik získáváte slevy z už tak předražených produktů, které všude jinde koupíte za půlku. Jedinou slevou je 0,5 Kc na litr paliva, což je výsměch. | Dobrý den, nikde v podmínkách jsem se nedočetla, že sleva na paliva nelze odečíst pokud máte CCS kartu . Nabídky nejsou pro mě zas až tak zajímavé. I přesto tankuji výhradně na MOL jelikož zde je dostupný LPG. | Od startu nového MolMove programu jsem začal tankovat u Benziny/Orlenu - super práce :)))) | Tato aplikace má neustále výpadky v přihlášení , načítání zhruba týden se nelze přihlásit. Hodnotíme jedna hvězdička … za mě ohromné zklamání . | Děkujeme za velmi příjemnou obsluhu, ať je 7 večer nebo 6 ráno, 👍 | Oproti aplikaci před nynější skoro žádné odměny, nebo úplně směšné. | Perfektni pumpy 👍 | Z mě neznámého důvodu mi byly odečtení body!!! Proč? | Aplikace sama o sobě plní účel a funguje dobře. Chybí mi ale 2 funkce, které by mi občas celkem usnadnili práci.

1. Účtenky v aplikaci. Bylo by super, pokud by v aplikaci byli účtenky podobně jako mají aplikace supermarketů. Občas tankuji firemní auto a účtenky potřebuji pro účetní. Jednou se mi stalo, že jsem si účtenku vzít zapomněl a musel jsem volat na benzínku, aby mi ji poslali na e-mail. Pokud by účtenka byla ke stažení přímo v aplikaci, dost by to celý proces zjednodušilo, nehledě na to, že by se ani nemusela tisknout a šetřil by se papír.

2. Přehled cen PHM v detailu stanice. Občas, když plánuju cestu, tak se dívám, zda jsou po cestě nějaké čerpací stanice. Pokud chci ale zjistit cenu benzínu, musím hledat na webech, který plní komunita. Když už jsou v aplikaci všechny informace o stanicích, proč tam nemůžou být i informace o aktuálních cenách? | Jsem nadmíru spokojen s obsluhou v Hrádku nad Nisou | Dobry den, stale nefunkcni.  Po otevreni aplikace zada prihlaseni a nelze se prihlasit | Po startu aplikace kliknu na přihlásit se a nic se neděje 👌 | Neustále odhlašování. Pak nejde přihlásit a musí se reinstalovat. | Po druhé instalaci vše v pořádku, jen bych možná trochu snížil hranice těch úrovní. Ne pro všechny dosažitelné. | Aplikace posledních par dní nefunguje, nelze se přihlásit. | Jejda! Něco se pokazilo. Prosím, zkuste to znovu.

Tohle mám pořád. Díky radě o přeinstalaci jsem přišel o přístup přes Apple, takže se snažím si založit nový vlastní účet, tentokrát přes mail, ale to opět nejde. Už to nemá smysl, to už je po několikáté, kdy jsem něco sbíral a opět o to u této společnosti přišel. | Aplikace se mi sama odhlásila a když se chci přihlásit, přeskakuje tam okno s kolonkou ""přihlásit"".
Zkusila jsem jí odinstalovat a znovu nainstalovat, přihlásila jsem se bez problémů, ale když jsem ji chtěla po natankování použít, opět mě odhlásila a přihlásit nešla. | Po několikáté reinstalaci - se nejde přihlásit - aplikace se zasekne v nekonečně smyčce přihlašovací obrazovky. Jak to říct slušně - vydejte zpátky plastové věrnostní karty a vykaslete se na aplikaci - to vám nejde… už 2 měsíce nevyšla oprava na tuto chybu! | Aplikace je zcela nefunkční, vůbec se nelze přihlásit…
Na ČS vám doporučí ať to zkusíte znovu a potom vás nechají zaplatit bez načtení bonusů… | Tragédie. Nelze přihlásit, i po opakovaném stažení | I cannot login into app, beause it shows login button over ond over again and it does not respond | Nejde se přihlásit. Opakovaně vyzívá k přihlášení a když se člověk přihlásí, tak ho to okamžitě odhlásí. | Aplikace mi nefunguje neustále mi padá je to na prd. | V posledních dvou verzích opakovaně nefunguje, dokola zobrazuje pouze nefunkční obrazovku pro přihlášení. 

Nejsem podle reakcí níže zde v Apps Store evidentně s tímto problémem sám. 

Můžete to konečně napravit vydáním stabilní a funkční verze! 

Takto je aplikace zcela k ničemu, již 2x jsem ji na čerpací stanici nemohl vůbec použít. 

Díky za zprávu, TM | Aplikace po aktualizaci nejede. Pri snaze o prihlaseni se prihlaseni nepodari a aplikace se pokousi porad dokola bez uspechu. U vice uzivatelu se chova stejne. | Aplikace neustále padá | Velmi příjemná obsluha na čerpací stanici v Liberci | Aplikace dobře funguje. | Aplikace neumožňuje přihlášení | Každou chvíli nefunguje. | Když nechci povolit sdíleni moji polohy tak mě to nedovolí  přihlásit se.

Nikdo to nema v umyslu resit, pry ze kdyz se to stane, mam odinstalovat a nainstalovat aplikaci. Stalo se to po dvou mesicich provozu. | Nelze se prihlasit, obrazovka se neustale aktualizuje | I attempted to use the app today, but unfortunately, I encountered an endless login loop. A woman at the gas station mentioned that I'm not the only one facing this issue, so it seems to be a common concern. | Aplikace to načítat úvodní obrazovku několikrát za sebou. Po úspěšném přihlášení mě aplikace odhlásila a už mě nenechá přihlásit znovu. Takže si ji i všechny benefity můžete strčit za klobouk. | Dnešní nákup mně opět utvrdil ve velmi dobrém pocitu zázemí, odpočinku i osvěžení na čerpací stanici Mool v Českém Krumlově 😁👍

Aktualni verze. Uz na tu zebrackou benzinku nikdy nejedu. | Měla jsem tuto aplikaci cca od listopadu 2023 a v lednu 2024 mi přestala fungovat. Neslo se přihlásit.

O | Je to skvělá aplikace | App does not clearly shows process for bike return and will charge you extra fee for incorrectly processed return. Also upon launch show map of whole EU, not your location. Brakes on bikes barely working (3 of 3 experiences). | Moc fajn appka | Nextbike je vážně moc v topu zaplať  pàn bůh za ni 🙏👏💪 | Rád jezdím s vašimi koly je to senzační opravdu promyšlené zábavné ekologické i praktické | Když můžu, skočím na kolo a frčím. Bezproblémové, rychlé, aplikace je jednoduchá, zatím jsem neřešila žádný problém. | Super nápad!!! | Při vracení kola, aplikace okamžitě zahlásí konec i cenu, na telefonu zůstane běžet. I několik minut. Neproběhne sinchronizace. | Super apka... | Celoroční přobližovadlo za skvěle ceny | Appka frčí tak jak má :) | Po mnoha letech u rekola a po jejich neurvalém chování při zaparkování kola u stojanu na Kampě vyhrazeném pro kola ovšem nikoliv pro rekola jsem přesedlal na nextbike a jsem nadšený! Lepší kola, lepší uchycení zavazadel, lepší převody, lepší servis, lepší apka. Těším se na další jízdy! | Služba dobrá. 1 hvězda dolů ta to, že se často stává, že zámek se neotevře… byť není účtován žádný poplatek, tak je to mnohdy otravné | Excellent! | Jsem spokojen | Pěkně | Neposílat dotazník spokojenosti když si půjčuju kolo😀! Zdržuje to! A dotaz: jak lze ovlivnit přidání dalších stanovišť nějakém městě… | Vše funguje v rámci možností jak má. Občas nedostatek kol na stanovištích a jejich hromadění na periferiích. Jinak s touto službou velká spokojenost. | Vše 👍 | Super,spokojenost😉👍 | Jen Škoda že tam nejsou zvonky ty lidi jsou někdy děs … | Sdílená kola s podporou města ideální priblizovadlo | skvělé, používám kola nextbike velmi často 💗 | Přehledná aplikace, kola v pohodě. | Great service, I think you have gradually become better bike sharing service than your main competitor Rekola. I would appreciate more parking stations outside of the city center (I live in Prague 13). | Ahojte, myslím že nextbike půjčování přineslo oživení do mobility Přerováků. Dávám 👍 | Nefungovala aplikace rekola, tak jsem si řekl, že zkusím nextbike. Povinná platba 50kč, která “se připíše na kredit”? 

Ani nevím, zda aplikaci chci a nutit uživatele hned k platbě? Díky nechci, sbohem.

Pokud se nepletu, Rekola ověřují uživatele za 1 Kč. Jestli i ostatní funguje takto, chápu, proč jich všude stojí tolik šedých kol, ale nikdo na nich nejezdí. | Láska jak hrom! | Dobrý den, Nešlo utáhnout sedlovku. S pozdravem, Novák | Něco hroznýho, do Písku dali kola 5 dní zpátky, buď mají píchlý gumy nebo nejde vrátit zámek. Odinstalovávám aplikaci, raději si kupte za pár babek vlastní kolo než podporovat tyhle zloděje. Nextbike jsem i zablokoval na bankovním účtu protože mi nejednou strhli peníze! Nedoporučuju!!!!! | Aplikace funguje na 100%. Kola jezdí ale jsou někdy Vranově šíleně stavu ze nevím zda odjedou do cíle… | Je to super | Usnadnuje mi cestu do skoly i cesty po meste | Nejvíc je úplně boží je v Brně hrozně moc toho. Prosil bych o přidání více stojanů a pokrytí celého Brna. | Super věc, používám docela často. Jen by se mohly rozšířit parkovací místa, např. zastávka Dvořákova (Přerov) směr nemocnice. Bydlím u toho a na všechny strany to mám pro kolo trošku z ruky... | kdyz není rozbity kolo tak vse funguje tak jak má. Ale když se neco stane tak se nedá skoro domluvit | Chtělo by to ještě odesílání souřadnic cílové parkovací stanice do Google Maps nebo Mapy.cz ✌️ | Od doby, kdy nám přibyla parkovací stanice před naším domem využívám Nextbike stále častěji! | 👍 | Moc si vážím toho že město Třebíč umožnilo tuto službu. Kolo využívá velice často.  Šárka Hotová | Díky za vaše kola, jsou pevná, kvalitní, mají nekolik rychlostí a chválím vepredu místo na tasku s gumou kterou se to da krasne zafixovat. | Písek jede elektro !!! | Ve městě je málo elektro kol a bylo by dobré více parkovacích stanovišť jak v MB a i v Kosmonosích například U masokombinátu u Dragona.CZ Děkuji | Díky půjčování kola se cítím fyzicky i mentálně lépe a ještě k tomu přispívání ke zlepšení světa, což me hodně zajímá. | Funguje

The app opens fast in the Apple Watch but it lacks the next 12 hour forecast that people usually see before going out. I would like to see the temperature and precipitations of the next 12 hours by each hour when I press on the complication. | Proč je mapa meteoradaru popsána v ruštině??? | App doesn’t show current data, needs to be opened and closed few times to get it up to date.

What are you going to change in future ??? Notifications ??? I have paid for to be premium user and you are degrading the premium adventages... If you will not change your mind I'll not use it the app anymore | confusing, why do i have an ad in the paid version?? | Rok mám předplatné premium, ani jedno upozornění na déšť nebo sníh.
Proč?!!!! | Když se ráno podívám z okna,předpovím jak bude večer lépe,než tato parodie na předpověď počasí..
Hezká grafika,ale to je tak všechno..Mažu.. | Tahle aplikace je na nic, normálně lže… celá obloha zatažená, provazy deště a aplikace neochvějně tvrdí, že má být skorojasno… | The app is perfect, the best I’ve ever tried. But the czech translation is really not good. What about a function to switch languages? | I’m wondering why they need to know so much about their users when there’s an in app subscription (which I’ll be cancelling).

They don’t seem like a honest company.

It's totally off with most of the predictions even for short period of time. Do not relay on these forecasts! | Opravdu je východ slunce jako nárůst a západ jako nastavit?

bad translation is funny :) | Ok | Great, but first day of week in Europe is Monday, not Saturday. It’s very annoying! | Často velmi nepřesné údaje. Navíc v české verzi nebyl autor schopen ani po delší době od nové verze opravit nesmyslný strojový překlad východu a západu slunce. | Still seems nobody reading this

Seems nobody is reading this...

New layout looks good disspite I am but dissoriented. 
Some Czech translation doesn’t make sense: 
- sunrise/sunset (moon) is not “narust” (to grow ) “nastavit” (to set up) but vychod slunce/ zapad slunce (mesice). | Is the last version some kind of joke? I can find basic things ... Terrible. | Mam to vyzkoušené. Pokud nechcete platit plnou verzi bez reklam tak si kupte aplikaci AdGuard VPN a mate každou aplikaci bez reklam. Na co všechno všude platit kdyz to aplikace umožňuje blokovat všude :D | La migliore in assoluto. | After 5 years daily using uninstall.... | older version was better | Nikde není uvedeno pro jakou lokalitu se počasí ukazuje. | Nedá se nějak nastaví v přehledu počasí na měsíc , aby týden nezačínál Nedělí? Předci jen úsměv ČR s ne v Anglii. | První zkušenost s minutovou předpovědí:
„Déšť začne za 39 minut... za 38, 37, 36, 35...“ Říkám si - tak schválně, protože na srážkovém radaru to na déšť nevypadá. A po 10 minutách najednou vidím „Žádné srážky po dobu nejméně 60 min“. Ať se jdou vycpat. Zlaté WeatherPro, které si na nic nehraje. | Accu Weather jsem měl rád dokud bylo příjemné uživatelské prostředí. To se ale změnilo a s poslední aktualizací je v aplikaci poměrně složitá orientace. | It would be worth revising the translation. Some items like sunrise or sunset are not translated well. Otherwise it provides a nice interface and accurate models. | Před tím byla lepší grafika | With new version search for local towns does not work. In addition at the header a location is named by number saying nothing about location. So you never know town or location your are see a forecast for. Do not recommend at all. | Původní verze o 100% lepší... | Pomalu se načítá a neaktualizuje se počasí ani widget. Dělejte s tím něco. Mám placenou verzi. To vědět tak to neplatím. | New upgrade is confusing🤦‍♂️ | Nová verze hruza😔 | It used to be a great app with nice design, now it is a perfect app with fantastic design. My only wish is more deep Apple Watch integration⌚️ | Seems most accurate out of all other weather apps. Eg now storm is coming and will be here in about an hour when checked on radar, but native iOS app shows sunny and storm in next 3-4hrs. | It was my favorite application for weather forecast till version 14. Since that the display widget shows info ""Unable to get the location"". Even with default location configured. | Nárůst a Nastavit znamená Východ a Západ
(slunce/měsíce)? | Po sktualizaci je aplikace jeden velký zmatek. Odinstalovávám a budu používat už jen čHMÚ. | Today I keep getting alerts for thunderstorms in NYC. I’m in Rome, Italy, so not really useful, are they? | :/ give me back old design | Afrer last update the app are unfrendly. I want to refund money back. The appearance of the application is tight.

Uplatnil jsem kupon na delší jízdu zdarma a naskočilo 5990 jízd zdarma. O par dní později opraveno a svítí tam už jen jedna volná jízda. Projel jsem ji a strhly se mi peníze. Nepoužitý kupon tam svítil dále. (Podpora mi ale peníze na žádost vrátila.)

Jeden den při používání aplikace jsem ztratil signál internetu. O dva dny později mi aplikace pořad tvrdí, ze jsem offline, i když koukám na plný signál 5G. Až restart aplikace pomohl. A tak podobně. Většinou funguje bez problémů, ale ne vždy. 

 Tip na přidání funkce: synchronizace aktivit do Apple Health. Rozhodně znám lidi, které by to motivovalo více jezdit, když by jim rovnou aplikace zaznamenávala jízdy jako aktivity. | Používám rekolu už několik let a jsem velmi spokojená. Moc ráda kola půjčuji, nemusím se o něj starat a  ani mít na to místo doma. Občas mám problém s odemknutím, ale je to v zimním počasí, takže úplně tomu rozumím a naopak vítám to, že kola mohu půjčovat téměr celoročně. Též občas mi vyskakuje nesprávná ujetá vzdálenost. 

Děkuji všem developerům!

Poznámka pro zlepšení: Uvítala bych integraci s Apple Zdraví ať každá jízda je započtena do aktivity. | If you are in Czech Republic, then the Nextbike is a better option. 
1. Rekola app loads slower. 
2. sometimes Litachka gets disconnected.
3. you need to take a photo of the bike, when returning it - makes the process slower
4. Rekola Bikes have only 3 speeds, comparing to 8 in NextBike | Za poslední 3 mesice jsem nemel jizdu, pri ktery bych nemusel hard vypnout appku. Prechazim cim dal vic na next bikes. | Posledni 2-3 mesice, se aplikace velmi dlouho nacita. Pri otevreni apky, pri vraceni kola, a celkova odezva apky je velmi pomala. Momentalne mam verzi 1325 a iP13Pro ios16 a ted nove 17. 
Navic aplikace porad pise ze jsem offline. Mam unlimited data a 5G | V životě jsem neviděla hůř fungující aplikaci na půjčování kol snad nikde na světě. GPS se nechytá, aplikace padá, nelze kolo vrátit, atd. atd. Hlavně že je to růžové. | Jsem opravdu velky fanousek rekol, ale posledni rok je aplikace ve strasnem stavu. Je velmi pomala a casto se musi restartovat jen pro moznost vraceni kola. Nevim co se stalo, ale rekola jsou momentalne velmi narocna na pouzivani prave kvuli nefunkcnosti aplikace. | Pokrytií hlavně u stanic metra, kde už MHD jede.

But everytime I return the bike the app freeze. 
Hence more minutes 😬
But I believe this can be easily fixed.
Pleeeeease 🙏 | I downloaded app cannot enter email neither can sing in with apple id.
I tried to delete and downloard app multiple times but its not working | I've been using Rekola for months now as it is convenient for me whenever I am around Prague. I have both subscription using multisport(2*60) and Litacka (2*15) per day. I was happy until I noticed they were charging me extra. Apparently, if you would use the bike for more than 15 mins it would be deducted both on your multisport and litacka. So, you end up using the service twice only per day unless you ride the 2*15mins (lack subscription) first before riding 2*60mins (multisport subscription), not the other way around. I don't know if others realized this. | Kdyz chci vratit kolo a probudim appku z backgroundu, hrozne dlouho cekam - bezi loading. A to i v Praze na 5G. Rychlejsi pak je appku killnout a pustit znovu. | Služba jako taková je úžasná. Nicméně aplikace by si zasloužila údržbu. Zpravidla každá druhá jízda mne neuvěřitelně vytočí… po skončení jízdy zapnu aplikaci s tím, že bych rád zadal ukončení jízdy, ale místo toho koukám minuty jen na piktogram kola a aplikace se nerozběhne. Pomůže buď několikrát shodit aplikaci, nebo hodit telefon do letadla a opět ho nahodit. Když máte vypočtenou jízdu do 15 minut na lítačku, tak vás aplikace vypeče a zbytečně platíte navíc. Velká škoda! | The service is great. The bikes are in good condition, they could been placed to more spots even further from the city center but that is understandable. The app on the other hand is terrible. I’m running latest version, on the latest iOS on the latest iPhone and it is so slow, a lot of crashes freezing and stuff. | Posledních pár týdnů je aplikace neskutečně pomalá. Obrazovka s načítáním často zůstává i dvě minuty než se objeví mapa/shrnutí cesty atd... | App doesn’t work. Server error 500 | Nekolik dni jsem aplikaci nemohla ani spustit (aktualizovana appka, aktualni iOS), po nekolika dnech se totalne pokazila, nelze se prihlasit. Hodilo me to na screenu, kde to predvyplnuje nejaky “example” email. Kdyz ho chci zmenit, nic se nestane, problikne stranka a dal to zustane na te screene. Zkousela jsem odinstalovat, ale stejne me to vraci na stejnou chybovou stranku, jako kdyby se aplikace zasekla v nejakem loopu. | Cannot use it at all now. Ridiculous. | Podpora- projevuje velkou ochotu cokoliv vyřešit. 
Neustále odkazuje na e-mailovou komunikaci. Super. To tam ten livechat nemusíte vůbec mít;) je to k ničemu když tam nejsou schopni poradit ani s tím, proc nelze přidat Apple Pay do apky ( Apple Pay je nastavené a funkční- denodenne to využívám,iph12) | Aplikace je nepresna a extremne pomala. Uz x let. | Složitější příběh zapříčiněný špatnou funkčností aplikace při přídávání platební karty. Celý jeden den řeším s pánem na podpoře bez úspěchu - prudí mě a tvrdí, že jsem dlužník. Druhý den s paní vyřešeno během hovoru za 5 minut. I tak hořká vzpomínka... Doporučení pro vývojáře - otestujte pořádně aplikaci před publikací!!! | Aplikace nefunguje, hlásí mi, že nejsem na internetu i když jsem. | Appka dopredu neupozornuje na moznosti parkovani - mimo parkoviste za 500 CZK a pri zajizdeni na parkoviste pak appka ztraci vyznam. Dal kolum chybi povinna vybava, nutna pro provoz na verejnych komunikacich a s policajtama se asi nikdo handrkovat nechceme. Predni brzda je na spatne strane riditek v rozporu se zvyklosti ve vsech evropskych zemich (krome UK), a tak nemuzu rict, ze by rekola byla bezpecna volba do provozu v Praze a ani jinde. To ze v mape nejsou vrstevnice uz je jen drobnost…
Celkove jako sluzba hodne daleko za pcekavanim. | Experiencing huge amount of bugs on the app. App shows there is a bike on the map and there is none. Trying to give back the bike and the app does not let me do it. It said: “The app is experiencing internal error”. | kdykolik to kolo potrebuju, appka je odhlasena, musim verifikovat maily, vytvaret novy hesla, ktery si nebudu pamatovat, protoze uz jsou asi milionty. A jako grande finale znova propojovat litacku a platit 1 korunu kartou, cely proces v noci, kdy je zima a nejedou spoje. Kdybych sla pesky, je to rychlejsi a nebudu nasrana. Toto se opaluje s kazdou altualizaci, bohuzel vzdy kdyz se to nejmene hodi... | Rekola jsou super a rada je vyuzivam, kvuli cemu me vic stve, kdyz je neco nefunguje Casto prijdu ke kolu, kde je vypustena duse nebo zablokovany zamek. Aplikace se pri vraceni kol obcas seka. To vsechno chapu, rekola nejsou gigant jako lime nebo next, jenom je to skoda | Jsem velmi nespokojena s vašimi službami | Love these, not just because the way hove to move around the city, but also because it started like a tiny project that grew up,not as a part of large corporation. | Best and cutest shared bicycles in the world. | Nejde vratit kolo piciii | Kola sú super, super servisovane, maximálna spokojnosť.

Jedna vec ale chýba v appke, možnosť ohodnotiť stav kola, prípadne možnosť nahlásiť problém aj bez vyradenia bajku z obehu.

Dík čau | Podpora večer nefunguje. Což není problém, ale:

Když se vám, jako mně stane to, že kolo nejde zamknout a tedy i vrátit, jste prostě a jednoduše v háji.

Celou noc platíte pronájem za kolo, které nezamčené stojí venku a je na vaši odpovědnost, jestli ho někdo neukradne. 

Fakt skvělé… třeba se někdy dočkáme opravy, ale když jsem jim to nahlašoval napřímo, jen se mi ti vtipálci vysmáli se slovy, jestli mi při zamykání nepřekážel výplet kola.

Dokud toto neopraví, vždy raději sáhnu po konkurenci a vám řadím to stejné. | Asi tak v 50 % se stane, že kolo není na místě, které ukazuje mapa. Je to celkem k vzteku jít 5 min pěšky pro kolo, abych zjistil že tam kolo není. | Jako všechno fajn a tak, ale:
- appka pomalá a občas divný záseky
- mimo centrum málo zón a některé mizí
- někdy málo kol a jejich stav nic extra | Rekola jsou dobré priblizovadlo po Praze, ale mají svoje mouchy. Když pominu fakt, že to jsou úplné vraky (napr. absence vzorku na pneumatikách me stala poradny drzkopad) tak mi vadí hlavně nedomyšlenost automatického prodlužování pujceni z multisportky, tedy místo načtení druhé jízdy zdarma to začne účtovat peníze. | Kolo bylo zamcene neslo zamknout do pipnuti nevsiml jsem si toho protoze pri zkousce pojizdnosti pipat zacalo.  Odjel jsem tedy domu po sleze jsem na zaklade vasi sms zjistil, ze kolo neni vracene. Na podpore se nikdo neozval, takze jsem se z domu vratil 5km ke kolu kde se mi podarilo kolo zamknout asi na paty pokus a velkou silou. Prosim o vraceni castky na ucet. Dekuji Kovar | Dnes jsem měl 2 nepříjemné zážitky, jak ráno tak v poledne se zopakovala situace, kdy aplikace ukazovala kolo, ale reálné tam žádné kolo nebylo - ráno na křižovatce Veverkova a Lwtohradska a v poledne na Staroměstské kde to dokonce ukazovalo dvě kola ale reálně nula. Už mě nebaví běhat ulicemi a hrát geocaching jestli tam nahodou nenajdu bonus v podobě kola ;) i když uznávám ze je to docela vzrůšo pokud zrovna nevaĺte do práce ;) | Super. To chceš! | The customer support is just great and they are better every year.
Rekola is setting up standard for a bike sharing app! | Nikdy více! 🤮 | I returned the bike, took the picture - still it was running like I was using it | Rekola mi opakovaně autorizuje drobné částky na platební kartě připojené do app.
Následně částku vrátí. 
Tímto Rekola velice narušuje mou důvěru, když muže z mě karty bez důvodně čerpat peníze a nemohu to ovlivnit jinak než kartu zrušit. 
Zákaznická podpora, reaguje ve smyslu že je to normální. S tím nemohu souhlasit a službu ruším. | Ta administrativa okolo je otravna. Aplikace vas napred nechce prihlasit kvuli technickym problem. Pak zase prudi, ze na tel cislo uz je registrovan jiny email. Ja chci jet na kole, ne si s vama 2 h dopisovat, na to fakt nemam cas. | Kedysi apka fungovala skvele. Teraz mrzne, neotvara sa fotak pri vrateni kola, nechyta sa gps. Nutne neustale apku resetovat nez sa chyti. Frustrujuce hlavne ked sa clovek na kole niekam ponahla a dufa, ze si na rekole skrati cestu. | Rekola sú super a je ich dosť ale samotná aplikácia je hrozne zabugovana. A zároveň má prístup k mojej karte. Veľmi zlá kombinácia | I když mám předplatné na 5 jízd za měsíc, tak mě aplikace nenechá půjčit v rámci předplatného 2 kola na jednou (jedno z nich musím platit zvlášť), proč? Jak často jedou na rekolech 2 lidi spolu? To je to tak výjimečné, ze s tím systém nepočítá?

Když chci jedno z půjčených kol vrátit, nedá se na nich fyzicky poznat, které je které, není na nich žádná originální značka, ze které by se to dalo vyčíst. | Stačí nějakou dobu nepoužívat a už se vám nepovede přihlásit. Aplikace vás pošle do smyčky přihlášení -> potřebujeme ověřit telefon -> tento telefon už máme v databázi, změňte si heslo -> změna hesla -> potřebujeme ověřit telefon -> tento telefon už máme v databázi, změňte si heslo… | Vse funguje jak ma, prehľadne a rýchle 👑",4.82324,16418,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f7/c1/17/f7c117c2-c579-ed93-09e4-341963ecdf78/fe03a880-4389-4b04-87d1-48d8e094978a_en-9.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/96/27/95/96279556-1612-5aa7-f2c8-4e5a19ed0319/6421276a-0a95-4f6e-af91-ab4ff7830e02_en-10.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f8/ac/4b/f8ac4b28-8bbf-5f8e-9aaf-2ce44d29bc7a/42e2562c-fdf7-4889-bdc1-459ff988f450_en-11.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/b3/92/e6/b392e6eb-4d3a-ac24-0fbf-78bedc32000a/390b97d9-e700-4b31-bfd3-b643d2429c1f_en-12.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Davam:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | I’m very happy with this app | Not too much for free but fine. | Ale je škoda že se tam nedá přidat zvuk(hudba) a také se nedá vytvářet dlouhé video. | Perfektní aplikace na koláže - krásné vzpomínky.... | Již jednou zakoupeno a znovu chtějí peníze. Ani náhodou. Nespolehlivý vývojář. | Aaaaauto 👍😉🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 | I really dont like the fact that I have to buy backgrounds and other stuff for money when the app is for free. That is also a reason why I dont use the app very often because I cant do the things that i would like to do, without paying and my parents wont pay this for me so i just simply cant use it.
Except that I think the app is pretty good and i like it, but i think the stuff that i wrote about earlier is a huge and unnessesary mistake the app managers are doing.
Oh and I forgot U HAVE TO PAY EVERY MONTH!!! NOT JUST ONCE! AND ITS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR BACKGROUNDS AND STICKERS AND I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE!

This makes it an essential app for all drivers parking in Prague.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/94/4f/05/944f05ea-8a70-246e-1ea2-b18eff18ad4d/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007epad-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""CS"",""EN"",""SK""]","94502912","14.0","2019-08-27T07:00:00Z","2024-04-03T08:32:12Z","Welcome to Citymove 3.6.2!
Simplify your traveling around Prague. Pay for parking in residential zones or plan your route with public transport and follow the live locations of trams and buses. We've added new services and small improvements in the new version.
 
What is new:
- New user interface for parking. You can now shorten the length of your parking session or terminate it entirely if you choose to leave early. Never pay more than what you use.
- New administration of cards to enable personal and business parking payments
- New payment getaway
- Public transport tickets have been replaced by sms tickets","3.6.2",0,"CZK",true,1451835698,"Skoda X s.r.o.","https://apps.apple.com/cz/developer/skoda-x-s-r-o/id1451835698?uo=4","https://citymove.app/en/marketing-consent",4.76818,"Po poslední aktualizaci není možné prodlužovat parkování. Po žádosti na uložení nového času aplikace odmítne požadavek provést a napíše, že parkování na zóně je již zaplacené a musí se počkat až aktuální parkovací relace skončí. Předchozí verze v tomto ohledu fungovala bez jakýchkoliv problémů. Bylo by možné chybu opravit? | Proč už nefunguje služba “zaplatit jízdenku kartou”??? Proč musím přes sms, které přes služební telefony jsou blokované… | I was only using the app to pay for parking. But the the app regularly logs out after some time or when they do an update.
This is so annoying that I'm stopping to use the app and going for an alternative instead. The app is unusable with logouts.
Moreover in the last update there's no Apple Pay option so I have to fill in my card detail like in the middle ages. | Uprostřed platby se iniciovala aktualizace která se těsně před koncem zasekla | Aplikace v 90% případů nefunguje, resp. není schopná zajistit platbu kartou, hlásí karty jako neplatné a když už jsem tam jednu konečne narvala, za měsíc už nebyla v paměti uložená a podruhé už neprošla 🤦‍♀️

Reinstalace ani 7 různých karet nepomohlo. | Aplikace jako nejkrtsi dobu parkovani mabizi 30 minut. Ostatni aplikace nabizeji i kratsi casy, tak nechapu proc to zrovna tahle aplikace nenabizi. | Nekdy se aut. nezobrazi, kde v Praze prave parkuji. Pak me to zdrzuje. Starsi app byla lepsi.., | Jednou za čas aplikace zahlásí problém s profilem a uživatele odhlásí. Po přihlášení je nutné opět zadat kartu. | K CityMove jsem před nedávnem přešel z MPLA, když se změnila na EasyPark. Bohužel (nebo vlastně bohudík) jsem si na CityMove nestihl ještě pořádně zvyknout, protože nemá pokrytou Ml. Boleslav (jak překvapivé, když je to produkt od Škoda X) a do Prahy jsem v poslední době jezdil sporadicky. Naštěstí už si ani zvykat nemusím - jarní novinka v podobě servisních poplatků při platbě parkovného mě přiměje k návratu k platebním automatům a tisku papírových lístků. Díky a mějte se fajn. | I appreciate the whole concept of the app. But: 1 / The Apple Pay button is missing terribly. If the payment gateway doesn't support it, simply change it. It is 2024. 2 / I would love to use it for business trips. The ability to input my invoice information would be great. 3 / Not being able to input more payment cards is just bad. 4 / The button “Check and vote for new features” sends you to - Oopsie, portal not found. 5 / When using it for the first time, I had to restart the App twice. After saving the card and after saving the licence place. Thank you for your work. | Dears,

without ApplePay payment option is your application useless for me.

ApplePay a GooglePay methods are currently becoming de facto standard due to security reason.

I’ll reconsider my score and give you 5 stars as soon as you add ApplePay option.

Thank you in advance and best regards, JK | Malý servisní poplatek za platbu parkování? Zvážili jste to dobře? Myslím, že zdaleka nebudu sám, kdo v takovém případě končí s Vaší aplikací. | Nepoužitelné. Vyžaduje uložit data platební karty. Naopak stále neumožňuje využít služby Apple Pay. Kdy umožníte tuto variantu platby? | Application does not allow me the bank card. I was even calling the bank and the problem is not on their side. So I tried to reinstall the application and I tried to make a different account but nothing worked. No clue what to do :( | Škoda že chybí možnost platit parkováni přes Apple Pay. Také jsem nepochopil proč čas parkování není možné volit po minutách a nebo co by mi dávalo největší smysl - po korunách s tím že by se nabízeli jen možné částky (např. by to začínalo na 10 Kč) a aplikace by koupila za příslušnou částku nejdelší možný čas.
Teď když EasyPark začal účtovat servisní poplatek 15 % je tahle aplikace asi nejvýhodnější řešeni, ale Lítačka umí zase platbu přes ApplePay. | Po pár použití musím říci, že aplikace je velmi dobrá a rozhodně doporučuji. Skvělé jsou push notifikace. Navíc podpora CCS, kterou MPLA nebylo schopné zavést do aplikace nikdy. 

K 5 hvězdám chybí už jen možnost přidat widget a hlavně, odpočítávání na zamčené obrazovce jako Live Activities. | Po aktualizaci se nejde přihlásit | Po poslední aktuakizaci nefunguje přihlášení pres apple a ani nelze přidat jakoukoliv  kartu. | There is a bug that i cant add my payment card, 
When i get to the page to add the card,
I add card details,
Then card needs to be authorized via card provider.
I need to switch to the provider app to press authorization 
When i exit the app the information is lost. 
Cant pass to next step. | Že není možné platit Apple Pay je skandál, ale jako že fakt. | Appka nefunguje. Hazi jen errory pri snaze o vytvoreni uctu. Velky spatny. | Již po několikáté mě aplikace zradila.Nebyla schopna dokončit zadání parkování v Praze…. | I just needed to pay for a parking ten minutes ago with Citimove app. But I could not - does not offer Apple Pay, but ot required me to type in information from my bank card manually! I am sure I have it somewhere at home, because when I enabled Apple Pay two years ago, I had to insert it to the Wallet app. But I have not used it since then, as all street shops, restaurants, and ATM which I met accept Apple Pay. I am sure I will forget to insert card number to the CityMove app at home, which means the app will be useless next time, when I would need it. So bye, I am uninstalling this app with pay methods designed in previous century! | Prosím, bude App v nějaké reálné době podporovat Apple pay? | Dnes jsem si stahl a instaloval appku. Je potrebne odstranit chybu, kdy nedochazi pri registraci k nacitani dalsiho kroku. Po stisknuti souhlasu s lokalizaci se zasekne a je nutne shodit a nastartonat znovu. Takto je nutne pokracovat pres kazdou vyzvu - notifikace, onchodni podminky. Jinak to vypada dobre. | Plánujete možnost platby přes apple pay? | Continue button doesn’t do anything, can’t enroll. | After the iOS 17 update the bottom sheet scrolling is not behaving correctly. When panning down in the table view, the bottom sheet is not colapsing | K ničemu prý neznámá chyba a abych si mohl přidat kartu bez které to prý nejde jsem musel zaplatit 1 Kč | Aplikace mi strhla peníze za jednu platbu jízdenky 2x, při reklamaci, mě dámy ujišťovaly, že platba zpět je v běhu… Po půl roce peníze stále nikde. Aplikaci jsem smazal, o tohle nestojím!
Edit
A kam myslíte, že celou tu dobu píší? | Everything works well. 
Not satisfied there is no applepay option. Not possible to quickly switch the cards.

Lítačka app has this option and it’s very convenient.

Pls consider adding ApplePay | When I first downloaded this app, I expected it would offer me the variety of posibilites how to get where I need. Instead, address search is useless, no way to create the route. From A to B. 

When I need to rent a bike it just offers me to open another app. What’s the point then if I’m not a driver. Much better to use Lítačka app to buy the ticket and check the route, or even Google… | Potřebuju zaplatit parkování na ulici v Praze, a aplikace zůstane ve stavu točení kolečkem na výběru doba trvání. Zaplaceno jinak ze stejného mobilu. Pro mne nepoužitelná aplikace … | Bohužel v Českých Budějovicích nejde vůbec nic přitom ČB je docela velký město prosím zkuste to nějak vyřešit | Nelze zaplatit za parkovani, aplikace neustale neco nacita a nelze nastavit delku parkovani. | Aplikaci používám málokdy, takže netuším, jak časté tyhle výpadky jsou - nicméně dnes se mi nepodařilo vybrat si ani svou SPZ ze seznamu uložených, ani přidat novou, ani smazat přidané. U výběru času se jen toči loading kolečko, a k platbě parkování jsem se ani neměl možnost dostat. Případnou pokutu mám pak rovnou přeposlat k úhradě na Škoda DigiLab nebo..? | Přestalo fungovat placení za parkování. Kolečko se točí, tlačítko je nefunkční. | Po aktualizaci nelze vybrat čas parkování, stále se točí “busy loader” | Support is not working.  No one responds to the form on the website even after reminders.  Not by email either.  So I'm trying the ""do the laundry in public"" technique and hope it catches on.  When that happens I will change the review.

Podpora nefunguje. Na formulář na webu nikdo nereaguje ani po urgencích. Na email také ne. Takže zkouším techniku ""praní prádla na veřejnosti"" a doufám, že se chytí za hlavu. Když se tak stane, recenzi změním. | hruza,po prikazu zaplaceni appka spadla a doklad prisel na mail,az jsem odjel hledat misto jinam | Spojit mapu next biku a rekol by bylo bezva. Jinak skvělá appka. Vše funguje jak má! Díky! ❤️ | Kym nebol update tak vsetko fungovalo, teraz nejde pridat kartu, nenacita rozhranie z banky a  nic sa nedeje, otras, skusal som to uz viac krat a ked treba zaplatit stojite tak ako … | Naprosto mi uniká smysl toho, proč si vývojáři myslí, že nepřehledným, nefunkčním a celkově špatným produktem si někdo nahradí používání aplikací PID Lítačka a MPLO. Navíc není v appce integrovaný ApplePay. | Самое лучшее приложение для тех, кто привык перемещаться на личном транспорте! 👍🏻 | App used to work great. I am no longer able to choose how long I will be parking and therefore unable to pay for the parking. Had to move to a different app which works better | Please add this payment method for the 5-star rating :) | I am disappointed. I had been using the app for more than a year and I was happy. After the recent updates, the app only offers a limited choice of parking times: for example 30 minutes for 30 CZK, 60 minutes for 60 CZK and so on. Previously, I was able to choose a much more precise time (10 minutes, 15 minutes etc). I have checked another app and they offer more granular options. I am sorry, guys, small things matter. Probably I will switch to the other one. | Po updatu zhoršení funkcionalit.
- nelze jednoduše vyhledávat spojení, 
je vidět pouze odjezdy ze zastávky.
Dříve apka navrhovala několik možností, 
jak se dostat z bodu A do B.
- parkování nově a lá MAPLA nepřehledné. Dříve bylo jednoznačně vidět, která část ulice je pod jakou zónou. Jsou běžně ulice, kde v jednom směru je zóna jedné barvy a v druhém směru jiné barvy nebo žádné. 
Toto rozlišení je nyní zcela znemožněno. | V nové verzi aplikace neukazuje žádné odjezdy MHD, spoje na mapě a neumí plánovat cestu. Pokud nechci koupit jízdenku nebo platit za parkování, je aplikace k ničemu. Mažu. | Updated:
The update came with the worst possible timing - during parking in the middle of city with no time to spend several minutes with setting up the entite app. Neverthless when all is done application works just fine and fullfills everything you need from it. Thanks to the update I discovered that it is possible to park also on blue zones for limited time. 

Original:
Developer updated recently application with following results - automated logout from account and not possible to login again unless password is reset, removed payment method so it is not possible to pay for parking unless you add, register and process testing payment again. That is crazy! Sitting in car, want to pay for short term parking, control cars passing by and I have to spend 20 minutes with setting the app completely again from the scratch.

etc.!?",4.76818,7562,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f3/f6/f7/f3f6f718-de75-c949-b551-5dd5f054442e/54eb1a34-4bf0-4866-914b-6e987e0d6bd5_Appstore_iPhone_X_ENG_smaller_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/85/d3/a5/85d3a517-8c2d-8f0a-2e85-c59101c19afd/9caa6db0-98f0-4c08-ad0f-eb1fa9cd5668_Appstore_iPhone_X_ENG_smaller_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/6c/fe/25/6cfe25b5-b9dc-e968-4d22-47f7b06d74a4/67e87b32-197e-4440-9fc6-6fbc9ea6f58e_Appstore_iPhone_X_ENG_smaller_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b7/cb/3d/b7cb3d4a-46da-d6e7-098f-686d7bb24dd0/6ee7d494-b733-47a2-b92e-7a14a03eb9ef_Appstore_iPhone_X_ENG_smaller_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/86/21/8b/86218b43-ab90-f632-0c04-a59f3eaffc60/e539250d-31a1-4d61-b129-f7e45aa85785_Appstore_iPhone_X_ENG_smaller_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b4/23/eb/b423eb10-19e4-e140-bac5-97e368b3069c/019c2d5f-e365-4636-bd60-7e8ba2d2ce5c_Appstore_iPhone_X_ENG_smaller_6.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/8c/42/98/8c429863-8f31-3165-833e-50370e6d7f31/78aa788c-c5b1-42a7-83d6-b94e65a93575_ios-tablet-2nd-gen-1-en.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f7/48/c3/f748c3f4-6aa9-bec0-5790-5d526884ddaa/b6013508-b2b1-4944-b203-6393fd23a1df_ios-tablet-2nd-gen-3-en.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b8/58/b9/b858b9f0-b8b3-8e76-3b5a-785395f06366/065253a8-90d3-4564-a99a-997c72a7ee21_ios-tablet-2nd-gen-4-en.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/56/1a/10/561a1006-c24d-5de6-45c3-46d2d4a19272/4d13470b-ddf7-44e4-b5e9-e563ca81e41a_ios-tablet-2nd-gen-6-en.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/39/bf/37/39bf3728-7e37-c8fd-6d8b-f2894d74aefb/a884e2ca-e082-4f60-92d9-8b50f1405815_ios-tablet-2nd-gen-5-en.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/90/47/33/904733d1-105e-285f-a19b-0e95dd35cbcf/e5baab3e-c9e1-4cda-b0e1-5f2d5d957e9a_ios-tablet-2nd-gen-7-en.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11F

Now I prefer serching the web for translation over this app. | The new  layout give less efficient steven info 
I like to old one more. | Proč měníte aplikaci která léta 100% funguje a využívám každý den za nesmyslnou grafiku, kde jsou miniaturní písmenka a nic není vidět.?
Proč se změnil název Překladač na Překladač Google když se to na žádném zařízení nemůže vejít ?
Z plného počtu hvězdiček dávám jenom jednu. | Překládá tak půlku a ještě k tomu špatně 🤦‍♂️ | .lffubzh | Works as expected. The Home Screen widget makes it easier for quick translations. It would be great if I could use the Share feature to send copied text directly to the app. | The translate is not accurate | The app doesn’t translate that good (when translating whole sentences or the article). Often times it miss understoods or translate wrongly. Even if I’m translating only to English, from deutsch or french… | Wow | Po aktualizaci z 15.6. nepřekládá text. | Začal fungovat jen na wi-fi…takže je k ničemu :-( | I'm waiting for Sorani Kurdish ☺️❤️❤️❤️✌🏼 | When translating images the app requires access to phone’s whole gallery (or annoying limited access). This wasn’t always the case - it used to have a less invasive image picker when user could choose a single photo without having to grant any permissions. | The camera translation was just ruined. It was working fine withou the lens and automatic quick translation. This is horrible now | Good morning, thank you Google for making this good translator. I also hope that there will be more new features and improvements to this app, especially for the Definitions and Alternative translations. Keep it up! | Fck new version 6.30 | neumi to prelozit to chci v nemcine | I have no idea what happened with this app but every time I want to translate a picture, it’s automatically translated into selected language. When I just want to copy and paste some text, mostly from Arabic language , I’ve always sent a picture here and I got the original variant and the translated one. Now I only can see the translated one + it’s using google lens and searching that translated word on the internet. What the hell is this??? I just want that original variant so I don’t need to annoy my friends to rewrite it from the picture. Also some Japanese text and Chinese. Horrible. | Была у Google Переводчик очень полезная функция: перевод текста с изображения. Как она работала. Загружаешь в переводчик файл, выделяешь нужный фрагмент и, или смотришь перевод тут же в строке, или загружаешь в переводчик. 
Теперь это «работает» совсем по-другому, через заднее место. Загружаешь файл в переводчик и он сразу начинает переводить полностью всю страницу. Попытка выделить фрагмент работает криво и со сбоями. При попытке загрузить текст в переводчик получаешь результат после двойного перевода, т.е. переведённый текст переводится обратно на первоначальный язык и результат снова переводится. 

Вывод. 
Функция перестала работать. О удобном переводчике можно забыть. | Tou aktualizaci jste to s prominutim podelali. Absolutne to nepreklada cele vety!! Neda se v tom vubec orientovat hruza a des!!! Chci zoatky predeslou verzi ne toto!!!! | Používám překlad z německého jazyka do českého a překlad je až nesmyslný. Chtěl bych vidět toho kdo ten překlad psal😂 | Čau | I’m translating something from English to German then I’m using some other translator and sometimes words or pronunciation is accurate but almost always the pronunciation is so inaccurate. | اوقفوا دعم للصهيونيه وجرائم اسرائيل | It gives you just one word unlike the web version where it gives you all the possible translations, and on top of that, the word it chooses to show is the least applicable most of the time.

And there’s absolutely no way to show all the other possible translations, neither even to suggest a correction. | Is very bad application | Když chci vyfotit nějaký text a chci si ho přeložit, překlad nedává smysl. | Tap to Translate on iOS doesnt work. It limits a lot, especially, if you are reading in foreign languages and time to time translation of a single word is needed 😞 | Why does the screen dim during photo

So why I wasted so much energy on it? If I knew you would kill it down so quick I would never even start it. Also a note about other events - you finish them at time that’s not suitable for all players and they can’t claim all rewards afterwards. | Hours of calm and interesting play. Without adds and super free to play!!! Love you devs and creators of this game. Additionally in nowadays almost all games with excellent graphics are with adds and short gameplay. THANKS! | After the last update it’s impossible to play because the game falls out each 1-2 minutes. Any solutions? | Zdravím , musím si trochu postěžovat . Nevím kdo tohle vymyslel ale zahrát si dvě vteřiny a pak čekat hodinu na další možnost mě teda docela štve . Jestli je to proto aby si lidi něco koupili tak u spousty lidí máte smůlu . Asi hru odinstaluji. 🥴 | … gameplay: impossible to get to some results without paying … everything is extremely long (like waiting 3 hours for charging broom without paying to merge some high level item last a week !!!!!). Extremely imbalanced.
… story: We cannot talk about story here? Those few useless dialogs in game does not create story. To see part of story means to play it 2-4 weeks just to see few sentences which, who doesn’t awaited, move story nowhere.

Who is this game for? Millionaires… or playing on toilet when you have nothing better to do. | I cannot express how much I love this game. I’ve been playing it for quite some time and it seems that you guys are really putting into it a lot of great work. Updating regularly and the updates and new features are wonderful. I never miss buying mystery pass so I can at least support you this way. And they are so worth it. 
Keep up the good work. Thank you. | Jak získám plavidlo, kdo mi pořadí prosím ??? | After the newest update I lost half of the items on the board and I can’t restore them. I am pretty annoyed because I lost a lot of high leveled stuff and it took a lot of time. If there is any way of help I would be glad because I really enjoy this game.:( | COMPLAINT! Why can't the game be logged in via Game Center (iphone) I lost my account..😡😡😭😭 | Nice job changing the buttons for “trow to the bin” or “buy for diamonds”.

Now I accidentally spent almost all of my diamonds.. | I like this game, but 1 star done, because rewards for completing a task are minimal, mostly still the same. And that is approximately 10xp, box of energy, or box of coins. No brown boxes and no blue ones at all. | Za mne dobra hra 👍🏼 | Fun game not much adds which is rare to see now. | Hi I’ve been trying to update but it’s not at all downloading nothing happens. | The last update quite destroy the gameplay. Bubles dont give money, level 3 pig gives almost none of the coins and gems (before update i got maybe 2-4k coins and 20-40 gems - and now 500 hundred coins and 8 gems) makes the game slow and unjoyable | I like the game very much. 
But since the recent update the Metacore logo appears before the loading screen.
It is like 5 seconds of staring at nothing. 
It actually made me consider uninstalling.

Remove it. It ruins the game. I don’t care about the company logo/name. I am already playing and enjoying your game. | After last update, I have number 1 (finished task) in tasks, but I haven't no more tasks. And another I don’t see. Thank you for fixing. | The worst game ever, if you don’t pay for the pink stones, you will spend weeks with achieving one thing, that you need to get (small) reward. It’s totally unbalanced! | Po aktualizaci nejde hra načíst! | Almost every day.. 3-4 hours maintenance services?? Really?? | “Sorry, the servers are under mainetance.” Again and again and again, all the time! Hate it. | Every Day is problem with your server for few hours. | I like this game but what i absolutely hate about in that its under maintenance All the FRICKING time when i want to play. Bro like let me play. | After the update few days ago, he “daily tasks” are going to refresh in 22 days. Recall them, please, or change it back to daily as used to be before the huge update. 

Also, I am now needing 3 cans of paint and for a day or so I have not got a single paint level 1 from two tool boxes. Do I need another month to do this task? I find this ridiculous. Either open more than one tasks or make the only task doable and not in a month. 

Thank you! | After the last  update I miss daily tasks in app. | The newest update is a pleasure for my heart, I love like everything became easier and more available! | are you really going to make me wait four levels before you open up the next garden modification? | Hra o ničem. Něco vyrobit trvá věčnost, žádný děj, samé bedny a spojováni věci, na které si musíte sakra dlouho počkat. Mažu 🤷🏻‍♀️ | Hello, can anyone tell me how do I get the seeds for the planted flowers please? Thanks a lot | Mám stejny problem jako ostatni - level 40 a konec. Pockejte na novy update. Jak dlouho? Uz cekam tyden. Nasbirana XP jdou kam? Event s motylama a murama jede. Hra je pekna ale cekani na update je nekonecne. | So many mistakes in the game after the last update 😕 Is there a plan to fix them soon? | Hru mám moc ráda, odreaguji se u ní, ale jsem v level 40 a finish?! I kdyz to ukazuje, ze v levelu 41 se otevře nová oblast, tak nic, dál to píše: dosáhli jste maximalního levelu, počkejte na další update.. a nehnu se prostě.. nebavěj mě ty “sezonní” jahodový a další akce, chápu, že je potřeba to nějak zpestřit, ale k čemu to je, když se už pak stejně nejde dostat dál.. škoda.. | I cannot download the newest upgrade | How can I download something when there is no download available? | Hra mě baví jenže nemůžu hrát když už nemám ty blesky nebo co to je a je hrozný čekat dlouho než jich zase budu par mít | Guys, it keeps falling out back on the home screen and everything takes so much time | I love this game and i spent tens of hours there. But - in The morning (8 hours until my event should end) i started Time booster (not The instant one but The tower). I went to school knowing my items dropping xps are high level so i need to go to The game often. I forgot about it, but i went there like an hour after. And guess what? They were maintaining The servers. Like what The hell Dude? You didnt say anything before? And because i went from school to work I couldnt update (i dont have so much data to download updates our of Wi-Fi) The game. And guess what. Not only The booster was wasted, but i coudnt even get hands on The 16 xp things because my event ended. I am never playing this game where people maintaining it are of this kind. | Hello, we are playing this game with my friends, and it will be so cool if we can send thing to each other. But this game is super good :) | Po stáhnutí update se hra nechce rozjet. Stále píše nainstalujte nový update ale ten už není k dispozici. | I really like this game, but after the last update I am not able to open it. It always stops on 56% | Po stáhnutí update hra nelze načíst (spustit)
Pouze načte 56% a dál nic . Čekala jsem půl hodiny a stále nic . 
Prosim opravte chybu , nechci začínat od začátku to už by bylo po 3. 
Děkuji | The game is stuck at 50% of loading. | After the last update the application cannot be opened… will it be repaired someday? | Po poslední aktualizace, se mi hra nenačítá a tak nemohu hrát. | After the last update game wont load. Its stuck on 55% | Je to úžasná aplikace jen si nesmíte omylem něco důležitého vymazat.😃 | It's this type of game which you hate but still play... | The game says it needs an update but theres no

Když sem se na ni vykašlal a jel jinudy, stále přepočítávala trasu do toho zákazu. Stará Boleslav - Hradec Králové.
2) mám zaplacené Premium a při každém spuštění navigace mě otravuje hláška s Premium Plus. Kolik těch Premium si člověk musí koupit, aby ho to přestalo otravovat. Nechci žádné Premium Plus, nechci!!! Premium sem zaplatil, aby to bylo bez reklam a teď tohle. A ještě mě bude navádět do protisměru? Cože? Měl sem tuhle navigaci rád. MĚL… | Chci vrátit své peníze!!! Proč si mám kupovat něco, co mi pak nabízí si koupit zase něco dalšího???!!! S tím jděte... Vraťte mi peníze za něco, co jsem nechtěl a dám vám klidně kladnou recenzi. Doporučení potenciálním kupujícím - nekupujte to. | Po aktualizaci jsem asi měsíc řešil, že mám zakoupenou lifetime licenci a stejně po mě pořád chtěli, abych přešel na premium+ a platil to znovu a znovu. Aplikace neustále padá a vede mě na nesmyslné odbočky. Někdy je to opravdu nepříjemné, když jedete v plném provozu městem a zrovna se to vypne... Kontaktoval jsem vývojáře a nikdo neodpověděl... | Po deseti letech používání se Sygicem končím. Přešel jsem na nový telefon a při snaze obnovit zakoupenou licenci se mi opakovaně objevuje hláška, že žádné licence zakoupené nemám. Znova za licenci platit nechci.

A když jsem před dvěma týdny psal na podporu, žádné reakce jsem se taky nedočkal.

Celkově tedy zklamání a přecházím na navigaci Waze. | Od jistého update komplikované přehrávání hudby na pozadí navigace. Sygic stále přepíná hudbu do reproduktoru telefonu, namísto audio systému vozidla. Když Sygic vypnu, hudba zase hraje přes autorádio. Aktuálně používám konkurenci, protože ta funguje bez problému. | Rất tốt | Please remove “sweet deal” splash screen! How many times do i have say no to your promotion offer? It keeps showing even when driving! I paid for the app, I did not pay to watch your promotion. I will not spend a cent on your app anymore because there are better navigations, offline maps as well, no agresive sales and no stupid splash screens. | Navigace neprepocitava  náhradní trasu!!!! | Nechápu jedno, mám licenci koupeno už asi 6 let kde je aktualizace doživotní Basic.
Přešel jsem z Androidu na IOS. S problém. Aplikace chcete po mě další 499 KČ Proč? Mám licenční číslo sále nemohu ho nikdy zadat Proč. Celou dobu vše fungovalo. A na jedno už ses někdy probudil že bychom chtěl nějakého penze? Čekáme na odpověď. | On my 12 pro Max and also now 15 pro Max this navigation resets often, gives wrong directions, can't find shorties way, navigates through fields, etc... Uninstalled. This app was perfect 5 years ago. | UI je skvělý, ale špatně naviguje. Naviguje mne přes vesnice i když mám vedle dálnici anebo hlavní tah. Díky tomu si rozbíjím auto po nezpevněných cestách. V Itálii se mi stalo, že mne navigovala i do uzkých uliček kde se z autem ani nevejdu a přitom vedle je hned hlavní cesta. | Cập nhật bản mới tệ hơn bản cũ, Icon nằm chính giữa màn hình rất khó nhìn, la bàn lúc chạy lúc không. Nên cân nhắc khi cập nhật. | V současnosti je to pro mě nejlepší navigace, 3 D objekty v pojetí Sygicu je moc fajn. Jen tak dál, nezaspěte na vavřínech:) | Koupil jsem plnou verzi. Teď jsem chtěl zkusit zase používat. Nějaké další premium+...Zlá doba subscriptionská, kdy i vývojáři se snaží zpoplatnit i obyčejnou kalkulačku. Chtít extra prachy za CarPlay, když konkurence to má zcela zdarma? Nevím no… Zaplatil jsem jednou a teď znova každý rok? | To pay quarterly or yearly is not what I want. Once and get the app fine but once a year 20usd does not make any sense to me and I’m curious who would pay for it. | Now they have new versiom and they want money again! It is a scam!!!!!
I do not like this app more and more. Why? Well, first of all they want you to subscribe for monthly payments - NO WAY! I already paid for it. Then they try to force you into subscription by limiting the use in carplay. How? No 3D maps, no speed limit on the screen. No lane following. Try anything else. Try Mapy.cz. It is free, you can download maps, you can choose amongst traffic, aerial, tourist, winter and basic map. No way Sygic. U no good!!! | Muze mi po X letech placeni Premuim prestat vyskakovat reklama na Premium pri kazdem spusteni aplikace, prosim? 🙏🏻 | I got premium and yet the app is neverending sales push spam to premium plus which is the stuff I pretty much already have, just without annoying subscription. I absolutely hate this customer milking attitude. Without the sales pitch, the navigation itself is not bad, but Apple free navigation is almost same and Waze is better and also free. | It suggest which lane lines to use, shows my current speed and speed limits and in iPhone Pro i shows directions even on lock screen. No other app that I tried provides all these combined. | Aktualizace 14.9.2023: po poslední aktualizaci neustále hledá pozici na silnici, skáče dopředu a dozadu a při dojíždění do cile je to díky tomu nepoužitelné v AppleCar. Čekám na opravu, jinak maźu a jdu na Waze. Po posledních dvou aktualizacích velice často bezdůvodně spadne. A skvělá nová funkce - spadne když se blížíte k cíli. Takže začnu hledat asi jinou navigaci :( | Psal jsem na zákaznickou podporu, ale nereagovali. | Při zadání konečné destinace nenabídne jaké mapy se mají stáhnout. Trasa přes několik velkých evropských státu, rozdělené na regiony nevím jaké stáhnout a složitě se mi to nechce hledat, takže jsem aplikaci zase ihned odinstaloval. | Sygic začíná být absolutně nepoužitelný, po každém spuštění chce znovu a znovu stahovat mapy i když jsou stažené. Smazal jsem ji a i když mám koupenou prémiovou verzi, tak ji nepoužívám. Vyhozené peníze. | There is a huge problem with the list of favorite places and the company is just stupid enough not to listen to feedback a user is giving them. 
A month ago I described the issue and asked to fix the bug. Yesterday I changed the Work address to a new one and today the app switched the address back to the old one. 
If not fixed asap, I will just unsubscribe and find a better solution. 
Even the navigation is buggy lately, while driving, it starts jumping to different places on the map and all of a sudden it tells you that you arrived to the destination but more than a half of driving is still in front of you. 
As I said, very buggy lately… | Po výměně telefonu nelze použit již před lety zakoupené heslo.Bohužel se musím po letech kouknout po jiné navigaci. | Eveme i open this app advertisment is showed to me! I did pay for the app!! | 👍👍 | Chỉ không chính xác. | Hodně zájmových bodů, informacemi nabité rozhraní a spousta zajímavých funkcí. Škoda, že nelze trasy snadno naplánovat na poditaciz a kompletně přenést do telefonu včetně všech průjezdních bodů, jako to umějí mapy.cz. A výpočet trasy občas dělá zvláštní věci. V Bavorsku po mě opakovaně chtěl sjet z (liduprázdné) hlavní cesty a prokličkovat vesničkou, přestože i na displeji bylo vidět, že za vesničkou se na hlavní silnici chce zase vrátit. | Navigace je super jsem moc spokojena | Přešel jsem z androidu na iOS a nemohu se přihlásit na premium účet i když se přihlašuji správnými údaji . | Dobry den nemohu tu nikde najít stahnout sygic voucher mám zaplaceno ale aplilce nikde | They tirelessly want to sell you something you don't want. You can't get rid of it. I bought the full version but now they keep asking me to pay for the monthly update. It can't be turned off. Lifetime 1/4 years of updates are artificially stuck so that they cannot be used slowly! Disgust. I do not recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a waste of money!

Neúnavně Vám chtějí něco prodat co nechcete. Nejde se toho zbavit. Koupil jsem plní verzi ale teď po mne furt chtějí abych platil za měsíční aktualizaci. Nejde to vypnout. Doživotní 1/4 lety aktualizace uměle zasekaly tak že nejdou pomalu použit! Hnus. Ne doporučuji!!!!!!!!!!!!! Jsou to vyhozené peníze!

Они неустанно хотят продать вам то, что вам не нужно. Вы не можете избавиться от этого. Я купил полную версию, но теперь они продолжают просить меня платить за ежемесячное обновление. Его нельзя отключить. Срок службы 1/4 года обновлений искусственно застревают, чтобы их нельзя было использовать медленно! Отвращение. не рекомендую!!!!!!!!!!!! Это пустая трата денег! | Zloději | Před lety jsem koupil doživotní premium  verzi na tři zařízení a když jsem týden nazpět přeinstaloval aplikaci na nové zařízení, přihlásil se, tak mám najednou základní verzi bez hlasového navádění a pod. Nikdo nekomunikuje, vyřešit to nejde. To mne vede k názoru že někdo je zloděj. | I purchased this navigation for our Dubai vacation and possibility of having offline navigation app. My first drive was to the gas station, navigation was horrible, many mistakes and first 2 gas stations were not exist ingredients in reality. After this experience I decided to download offline map from mapy.cz and my experience was much better. | Pokud mate aktivni predplatne a nechate se nachytat na aktualne levnejsi licenci Premium+, nezapomente zrusit puvodni predplatne. Na jednom uctu muzete mit nekolik predplatnych, tedy ackoliv jsem myslel ze novou rucni koupi licence budu mit poreseno, byla mi strzena platba i za obnoveni puvodni licence. Nyni mam zedy dve licence na jeden ucet 😒. | Určitě není žádané při každém spuštění aplikace aby na me vyskakovala “reklama” při zakoupené premium verze o rozšíření na premium +, hrozně otravný | Jste SUPER👍 | Zkusil jsem po dlouhé době dát opět Sygic šanci. Měl jsem koupenou lifetime licenci pro celý svět, ale lifetime evidentně není zase až tak moc lifetime v podání Sygic a v dnešní době je ta licence již k ničemu a bezcenná. Už to samo o sobě je podpásovka. Dal jsem ale Sygic druhou šanci a za 500 Kč si koupil roční licenci premium+. Teď už vím, že to byly vyhozené peníze. První věc je, že doba dojezdu se na trase dlouhé 40 minut několikrát změnila o řádově desítky minut nahoru nebo dolů, aniž by se měnila samotná trasa. Měřené úseky nejsou v mapě hlášeny jako měřené úseky, nýbrž jako dva radary, což je hloupost. Navíc data radarů jsou dost neaktuální a i Seznam mapy mají přesnější informace o radarech. V zatáčkách se obrazovka navigace různě podivně přetáčí tam a zpět, jako by aplikace nevěděla, kterým směrem ve skutečnosti jedu. Po chvíli navigování se navíc ztratilo barevné vyznačení trasy, takže jsem jel v podstatě po slepu. V průběhu cesty se mi navíc stalo, že z ničeho nic na dálnici mi navigace zahlásila, že jsem dojel do cíle, chvíli na to se vzpamatovala a pokračovala v navigaci. No a v neposlední řadě navigace ráda padá. Suma sumárum - škoda času a vyhozené peníze. | Mnohokrát jsem tomu dal šanci, ale naviguje opravdu špatně. Má hezké prostředí, ale to bohužel nestačí…. | Po dlouhé době jsem zkusil oprášit Sygic. Při výjezdu z Plzně mě to nutilo sjet na Rozvadov, otočit se pod mostem a najet zpět na dálnici tím samým nájezdem. Exit Rokycany - jeďte rovně. Až do Prahy otravné přeblikávání modré cedule na zelenou a naopak, na každém sjezdu asistent pro jízdu v pruzích. A v Praze rovnou šup do zácpy, dál už jsem na to neměl nervy. Představa, že mě to takhle naviguje tam, “kde jsou lvi”, je upřímně nic moc. | V poslední verzi aplikace 23.0.1 nefunguje navigace přes CarPlay. Okamžitě zamrzne, nefunguje ani jedno z dotykových tlačítek. Při průjezdu tunelem spadne totálně. Podpora klasicky hledá problém na straně uživatele (značka a model vozu, verze CarPlay). Vzhledem k tomu, že předchozí verze fungovala bezchybně, tento jejich alibismus nechápu. | Nejdřív Premium pak Premium + co bude dál Premium + + jenom aby vydělali víc ? | Drive jsmem měl neomezenou licenci ze Shell. Nyní nepoužitelné..Sygic jde cestou platby za vše. A přitom jsou mapy neaktuální..třeba nové Tesco v Kutné Hoře ani nenajde. 
Waze je zdarma a lepší aplikace 😉😅 | Ta aplikace byla dřív fakt skvělá. Ale dneska už je bohužel spíše podprůměrná. Největším problémem je, že není spoleh na základní věci jako je stabilita aplikace a samotná navigace, která poslední dobou často prostě naviguje špatně. Což jsou u navigace dost podstatné závady, řekl bych. | Aplikace pravidelne pri pozivani padá a pokud se to stane v tunelu,navigace se stane nepoužitelnou.  Pády aplikace přechází z verze do verze. Nepomohla aktualizace iOS ani výměna přístroje. iPhone 13, iOS 16.2 | po zaplacení doživotní licence vypnout hlasové navádění? krádež! | Podle názvu firmy to nenajde nic, dokonce ani na Slovensku. A pokud to přece jen nějakou adresu vyhledá, tak ta firma tam již deset let nesídlí. Jakákoli navigace zdarma je lepší, než tenhle trapný drahý paskvil. | Koupil jsem premium verzi a ani ta neumi CarPlay!

One is possibility to add more than one address for home or work. This is crucial for the statistics of charging locations. I have company car and we have more locations where I charge at company chargers. But in statistics I see only one location for work charging. The same is valid for home. You can have house, second flat, cottage...
Second thing is if there is a chance to view current charging speed. I just charge until I see 100kw and then I want to end it and go. But I do not see it in the app. I know there is statistics - but that is only history... Maybe just to see it upon request from the app if it is difficult to handle by servers?
Thank you for considering.
Peter | Aplikace je celkem dobrá ale nejde nastavit procenta na kolik chci nabít baterii. Vždy se nabijí na 100%. | Funguje jak má, možná udělat zkratku pro akční tlačítko na iP 15 ? | Опять не работает. | 👍, do města nejlepší volba vozu BMW i3 👌 aplikace také naprosto super 👌 | - please add the possibility to set up charge level (there was a workaround in bmw connected but not possible to stop charging remotely now in my bmw)
- please add notification for low battery level (mostly usefull for plugin hybrids)
- please add the statistics for range based on distance driven between chargings (probably weather based and gaussian because of different pace, but I would know how far can I go when I really try in similar weather)
- consumption based on mean from these stats can compete with others to see how eco you usually drive (at least same models) | Skvělá aplikace, využívám ji pro přehled spotřeby a plánování jízd. | Incorrect location on map, not showimg fuel, opening/closing csr, ventilation and horn last forever. | Moc dobře nefunguje | - features basically none unless you pay a regular fee
- very annoying updates requiring logging in to the app, several popups in phone after starting car after such update | There used to be the mileage of the car available to see for every entry of the charging history, is it gone with the latest update?! | Some features are now gone with the last update, such as mileage in charging history… I found it useful to keep track of the distance covered between charges, but oh well… A lot of (more or less) useful features otherwise… 👍 | I am getting error message - “an error occurred while assigning your BMW”… | Bit chaotic design, I can activate horn (very useful) but cannot close the windows, surround view doesn't work, repeatedly have to sign again and again. | Top  služba   Nemá konkureci | Po aktualizaci se pořad odhlašuje | Nefunkční | Dobrý pomocník člověk je vždy informuje vám nastavil svého vozu | Aplikace je fajn ale store na ktery odkazuje je eshop jak pred dvaceti lety vse se neustale seka, je nutne opakovane zadani. Jestli tohle reprezentuje BMW jsem zklamany. | Auto se aktualizuje a pořád něco nefunguje, aplikace se aktualizuje a …….
Nechci počítač s modrou obrazovkou, ale auto. | Phần mềm rất hữu ích , chỉ cần cải thiện thêm tốc độ sử lý nhanh hơn nữa thì hoàn hảo. 👍👍👍 | Super | V aplikaci nelze nastavit do kolika procent se má baterie vozidla nabít. Aktualizace stavu vozidla se načítá strašně dlouho. Odesíláni příkazů do vozidla trvá dlouhou dobu. Nelze pomoci příkazů zavřít okna. Někdy aplikace hlásí, že je vozidlo v úplně jiné lokalitě než se ve skutečnosti nachází. | Pomalé jako bych příkazy posílal českou poštou. 
Prosím, vytvořte kartu pro Apple Wallet🙏 | There is no possibility to login with the password. Iphone 14pro, ios 16.02 | IOS 16 - well, login is not working | Funguje skvěle, rozšiřuje možnosti využití vozu. | It's the best app ever and it's free | Apps je v pořádku a fajn, ale na dálku zamykání přes mobil se neaktivuje alarm a ani led světlo pod zpětným zrcátkem, škoda.
A žádné hlášení třeba typu nezamknuté auto. To me třeba MB. | User friendly app 😎👍 | The last version does not show  the correct amount of fuel and correct position of car on map. | Po updatu ukazuje že je vozidlo odemčeno přitom je zamčené .. pokud odešlu příkaz k zamknutí zareaguje ale žádná změna | Says that was not able to retrieve T&C and ask to try again later | Problém se změnou hesla, jinak spokojenost | 30.11.2021 Stále chybí podpora pro AppleWatch jinak aplikace funguje výborně. Minulá aktualizace přinesla detailní informace ohledně stavu dveří a oken. Škoda, že ID6 již nepodporuje přenos informace o tlaku kol. 

11.10.2021 Aplikace funguje výborně a má moderní vzhled. Nemá problémy s aktualizací stavu vozu jako aplikace předchozí. Škoda, že stále chybí podpora pro Apple Watch. Příjemná náhrada a budoucnost aplikace Connected. Nový svěží a moderní design po kterém je znát již pokročilý věk původní Connected aplikace. Funkčně stejná, zatím bez podpory/vlastní aplikace pro Apple Watch (proto o hvězdu méně). Aplikace pro Apple Watch snad dorazí brzy ;-) | Pitty, that apple watch support is missing. | No remote services after app update :-( | Kdy uz konečně vrátíte výbornou aplikaci zpět do hodinek?
Byla to super pomoc u EV. I3. | The new one is more stable with no crashes. Unfortunately some of the great features from the previous version are missing such as: no option of sharing yor location and the time of arrival with your friends, no option of travel scheduling - you can ´t plan the trip from app in advance and choose a certain time of getting in to a destination. Shame 😢 | With the new features added here and there the app is becoming even more useful and easier to use. When the feature to export the charging history it’s feature complete for me now. This was something I thought would be really nice to have and now having it I feel totally satisfied with the app. Also, unlike the old one, this one never fails for me. Works very reliably. | Žádné vylepšení jsem za poslední  dva roky od pořízení vozu nezaznamenal. Byly problémy s Office podporou, které vyřešili zrušením příslušných položek v menu systému auta. Aplikaci v Apple Watch, která docela fungovala, zrušili s nástupem verze “My BMW.” Údajně nebyla příliš využívaná. Argument nechápu. Upravena byla grafická podoba, která již není tak kompaktní a přehledná. Žádnou novou funkci jsem nenašel. Aktualizace SW vozí sice jsou, ale bez jakékoliv informace pro zákazníka. Nejdříve se ještě není odladěn a pak jsou funkce ořezávány, jak ukazuje zkušenost i potvrzení oficiální podpory. Je to škoda. | Pokud v aplikaci zadáte cíl cesty a odešlete do vozu, ve voze se na displeji neobjeví notifikace příchozí zprávy a vy tak musíte listovat do Connected drive a dále do zprávy BMW, což je samozřejmě opruz a zdržení. Stará apka fungovala v tomto směru bezvadně. | Jo appku do hodinek zapomeli | Právě mi z aplikace zmizel moje auta. Na webu je vidím. 🤷🏻‍♂️ | Krok zpět,  hrůza hruzoucí a to si říkají prémiová značka … Neukazuje tlak pneumatik, zda je zavřená kapota, kufr, plánování trasy kostrbaté. Předchozí trasy chybí | Zprávu o nové apce jsem přivítal s očekáváním že někdo konečně pochopil že BMW ujel vlak a je třeba přepřáhnout koně.
Bohužel appka je nadále co se týče funkčnosti na míle vzálená tomu co dokáže konkurence.
Na BMW jsem přešel od Mercedes. Doporučuju si někdy nechat ukázat jejich appku v činnosti
Tomu říkám appka co pomáhá. Jediné k čemu jsem potřeboval klíč bylo odjet.
Rychlá, nápomoná, stabilně funkční… prostě všechno co BMW nemá 🙁 | Ve starší verzi zasílání cílů vždy fungovalo bez problémů. V nové appce i po kontaktu s call centrem BMW nefunguje. Ostatní je stejný, takže vlastně nic nového tato appka kromě designu nepřináší. | Neukazuje dojezd ani stav paliva, ani po připojení kabelem, zmizela možnost klaksonu(ve staré furt funguje oboje) Klakson tak často nepoužívám ale stav nádrže a dojezd mi opravdu chybí... | In all aspects the older version of the app is better. I hope you are not going to discontinue usage of an old app, as the new one i really discourage anyone from using. | Jak se stalo již tradicí, tak byla znovu nahrazena aplikace, která postupně přestávala fungovat, novou verzí, která opět funguje, ale ztrácí některé funkce. Odhaduji, že do pěti let bude zachována jediná funkcionalita - zobrazení loga BMW.",4.81592,5791,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/12/37/17/12371774-f5b9-7426-0164-c2986f5f7892/af82c6ee-8c00-409a-a0d6-768eb3772aec_T1_BMW_iOS_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/75/41/97/754197a9-1f36-975d-a641-dcd00d2fddf0/4864b811-d2e5-47ab-9747-ddd664a66eb6_T2_BMW_iOS_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5b/3a/6f/5b3a6f56-d338-720b-4c42-2e1a7859e9ea/3a4e162f-03b9-4412-b05b-5d9949e4e429_T3_BMW_iOS_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ca/6e/71/ca6e718a-58c4-f7a8-4113-f143e140778f/34b595bb-a640-4500-83aa-bb2029d5225f_T4_BMW_iOS_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/e6/f1/44/e6f14462-3e58-8f47-90b0-cb01fae4493f/947aae06-42f0-451a-9dba-d6bfca4098ea_T5_BMW_iOS_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/0d/cf/3f/0dcf3f55-14c3-1cc5-f28b-d8a418d6df9b/e9576ef9-36c5-4a85-b3e1-dc2756f47d0f_T6_BMW_iOS_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/73/96/04/739604a1-ad33-ea36-c46c-c28261f056c8/f5957daa-95f5-45a6-874d-6e5d0efdac97_T7_BMW_iOS_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/5f/47/07/5f4707a0-e021-9a8d-7cf7-fefb7a051b8c/dc8fbd67-ea82-4bdd-a5f4-4d857b4b55a2_T8_BMW_iOS_5.5_.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Chápu, premium funkce ať něco stojí, ale základní ? Vtipné. | I při použití trial verze, musíte nejprve potvrdit předplatné, tak bacha ať ho potom nezapomenete zrušit. | It works perfect. When we were on vacation, we always knew how’s the weather. | Pokud nebudete platit paušál ( ne zrovna malý ), nebude předpověď, jen to, jaké počasí už bylo… 🙁 | This app uses, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out, a so-called “dark pattern” subscription scheme. When you try to open the app fire the first time, you are required to sign up for a one week free trial—which will of course automatically be converted to take ninety crowns of your money each and every week after that until you remember to stop the Akrobatik subscription. It’s a scam. Why Apple allows this kind of thing, I can’t imagine. The app literally has zero functionality, unless you sign up for the free trial. It shows a blank screen demanding that you do that.
REPLY TO DEVELOPER RESPONSE: Sorry, but there is NO option to simply run the app in non-pay mode. The signup screen appears for the paid plan and you have no way to bypass that screen and get the app to do anything. So what you’re saying simply is not true. | A weather forecast app that only forecasts weather after you pay. Therefore a paid app disguised as a free one. Do not recommend. | Moc tomu není rozumět | Jen jedna z dalších aplikací, která nabízí možnost 7 dní zkušební verze, a poté si účtuje peníze.

Most of the apps showed rain but this one didn't although it was actually raining. | at the end of the trial period, the application automatically activates the paid version. don't install it! | There are better free apps with much more accurate local radar data. Also offer for trial is a typical design dark pattern. It seems free, but after the trial you are charged without ask. It’s mentioned, but in a way that user can easily overlook.

Nesnáším tyhle vyjebávky a nejde o těch mizerných 89,- Kč. Běžte do prdele, křiváci | Good weather! 😉 | I po vymazání si aplikace účtuje platby. Pozor na to a ani ji nezkoušejte nebo se jí pak nezbavite

Vysvětlení pro vývojáře: Když aplikaci vymažu, tak to znamená, že ji NECHCI používat a když ji nechci používat, tak NECHCI ani předplatné. Když umí promptně po instalaci předplatné nastavit, tak by je měl po oddinstalaci stejně rychle zrušit. Škoda, že nejde ubrat i tu poslední hvězdu, protože za nefér jednání si ani tu jednu vývojář nezaslouží. | This app sneaks the subscription into your itunes billing.

4 months after coming back from Phillipines I get voice call by grab driver via grab audio via this app... and it wakes me up.

You just randomly call me in early morning and wake me up.. when I come back to Phillipines, I will rather order food on Facebook and use any other means of transpo than ever using again ur services | Freaky registration - errors all the time. I’m in KL now | Why in Cambodia we can ´t pay by ABA? Also payment in USD missing. But in general great services! | Unable to sign in on iOS. | Can't deal with phone number change and as a result prevents me from using my email. How annoying! | 1)Make order to Old adress 2)One second try to cancel and make order new adress= cannot 3)look about new order delivery new adress cheaper then Old order add extra money 4)when ask Custemer service why deferent price for same adress no answer 5) cannot share location cannot send picture of location to driver 6) 2 days ago order half evening grab mo driver restaurant no driver wait food coming sms sorry no driver !! Wait order again and hungry no driver all evening go eat in restaurant Grab not working!!!! So bad expiriance!! | Grab is very good service. In KL, there is pretty hard to rely on public transport (buses) so this is a great. You know a price before you confirm the ride so you cannot be cheated (also you can pay with card in Grabpay), prices are really good compared to Europe and also there are many drivers around so you don’t need to wait a long time. For 6 months a did many rides and all of the drivers were really nice people. Food delivery also good service. | The best app if you are in Indonesia! Always only a great experience. | Not working on new ios, tried on different phones as well. | Cancerous piece of utter garbage app. I hope this crap won’t spread to Europe. Cannot find a bloody car in a capital city. Feck off. | app is great as well as the service. using several times a week | It contains tons of annoying advertisement popups inside the app, not speaking about the ad notifications enabled bu default! Switching back to food panda... | Very cheap, fast and easy transport. I would recommend for sure!! | !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | I loved this application it’s really comfortable. But last changes... now car can’t wait more than 5 minutes and I need to take new car. It’s not comfortable!!! I’m ready pay more for driver for waiting. It’s better like if I’ll wait for new car. | iOS 12.1 app not works, still only green screen and that's all... | I think it’s good to travel around the city with a grab bike and you don’t have to deal with the riders/ drivers about prices. Like that you won’t be cheated! | Beware, especially as a tourist who doesn’t speak Thai - there may be hidden fees and tolls and since some drivers does not speak English to explain, you may be surprised by extra money to pay when the ride is over. | I was never able to sign in using my google account, it keeps saying server not found. | The best way and deals... love it | The grab application and service is very good, except one important detail. The selection of the pick-up and drop-off locations do not work well. Even exact place on the map is choosed, the application changes the locations to some close points. It is usually just 20-60 meters far away, however in big city it sometimes means the driver is waiting on completly different road.
It would be good to look as Uber implemented this - 1. It never change the location by itself  2. It asks again to confirm exact pick-up place directly on the map. | Perfect, better and cheaper than Uber :-) | Cheap price, nice drivers | Fast, convenient and so far 'safe' ... avoid traffic! | Best!

Nejdříve jsem se zlobila , když mi přišel k vyplnění celní formulář kvůli clu, ale vše je po vyplnění v pořádku😊 Nic navíc se nikdy neplatilo. 
Jednoduché na zpracování  v aplikaci + bonus mapy 👍to se mi líbí hodně.... výborná práce děkuji vám moc👏👏👏 | Objednali jsme si v prosinci 2023 fotoknihy a kalendář. Knihy jsou v pořádku. Bohužel jsme si pozdě všimli, že u fotokalendáře k fotkám z roku 2023 byl přiřazen kalendář nikoli na nadcházející rok 2024, ale na končící rok 2023. Považovali jsme za samozřejmost, že k fotkám bude přidán kalendář pro následující rok. Takže velké zklamaní. Vzhledem k ne zrovna nízké ceně si příště zvolíme jinou aplikaci. | Jednoduchá, snadná aplikace | Fotokniha👍👍👍 | Consiglio!! Applicazione facile da usare e soprattutto comoda per spedizioni all’estero | I’m still waiting for my order ( No customer care at all and no photo album. | nadherne zpracovani, objednavam uz podruhe | Nejlepší firma na vytvoření fotoknih a fotek. Krásné, úhledne a možnost si s fotoknihou pohrát a doplnil ji o mapy, texty,samolepky a mnohé jiné bez příplatků. Fotoknihy jedine tady 💕 | Krásná fotokniha, kvalitní zpracování👌 | Děkuji za skvělé zpracování, milé překvapení.🫶 | Výroba knihy byla sice super jednoduchá, ale knihami stále nebyla doručena, přestože dnes byl poslední den kdy doručena být měla. Doufám že ji někdy uvidím.🤨na e-mail mi nikdo neodepisuje. | I ordered the book, it was supposed to be delivered to me on September 21 - and I'm still waiting. | Rychle zpracování, vzdy vše v pořádku, krasne provedení. Za mne top👏👏👍. Vřele doporučuji 5✨ | Super vždy kvalitně provedená práce mohu doporučit | Rychle dodání cca 10-14 dni, přišlo českou poštou. 
Kniha vypadá stejně jako v náhledu, fotky ostré, kvalitní. 
Využiji určitě znova ☺️ | Perfekt | Fotoknihy jsou krásné. Objednávám už pravidelně.
Kvalitní tisk fotografií a když se vyskytne jakýkoli problém, je možné ho vyřešit velmi rychle. S reklamací jsem neměla problém a komunikace s paní Emilií A. byla skvělá. | Objednala jsem knihu na lesklý fotopapír. Některé fotografie jsou rozmazane i přes jejich malou velikost. Tisk je kropenatý. Nedoporučuji. | Krásné zpracování fotoknih, skvělá aplikace rychlé odeslání a doručení na adresu. Mám již několik knih a další určitě budu objednávat. | Doručení bylo rychlé, přidané mapy bych trochu vylepšil ale jinak cele zpracování je nejlepší ze všech možných fotoknih | My flatlay albums arrived in perfect conditions. Photo colors are as close as possible to original pics, and journi customer service has been very helpful, understanding and professional. | it arrived today, great satisfaction, speed and quality, I recommend it and will definitely use it a few more times. | Ráda doporučuji! Jednoduché zadání, dlouho jsem hledala jednoduchou aplikaci pro fotoknihu. Dodání ze zahraničí bylo rychle, kvalita super 👍 | Výroba knihy byla suprová, byla jsem nadšená jen do doby, než žádná kniha nedorazila. Čekám téměř měsíc a stále nic. Chtěla jsem knihu po dovolené ukázat rodině a ne že budu čekat několik měsíců než příjde, jestli vůbec někdy dorazí. | Vždy všechny mé objednávky výborně zpracovány, doručení taky vždy v daném termínu. Děkuji a už se těším na další fotoknihu… | Skvělá kvalita fotek, úžasný lesklý papír | Bohužel i přes foceni na iPhone 14 Pro jsou fotky bohužel v nic moc kvalitě.
Celkové provedení knihy pěkné, možnosti úprav dostačující. Nevím proč, ale kvalita fotek je opravdu mizerná. Nejasné a nezaostřené. | neustálé prodlužovaní doručení, balíček stejně nedorazil | Objednáno 6. 01. 2023, nicméně Fotokniha po téměř měsíci nedorazila. Špatná komunikace. Nikdy více. | It was such a fun to make our own year book. 
The book was delivered today and it looks really nice. Bright colors on high quality paper. 
Next year I will make another one. 
The best photos should be printed in my opinion. 
I recommend this app 100% ☺️ | Terrible quality! | I love making the photobooks and I’ve got various experience in many softwares. I do enjoy the Journi one more than any of the competitive ones. Everything is just super intuitive and easy! Love every minute of working in it and every second of going through the photobooks. I can recommend this app to anyone. The beginner photo-book-creator to expert one! Noone can ever be dissappointed!!!! BEST APP EVER | Hurá! Doma už díky této aplikaci máme několik krásných knížek s fotkami. Snadná, přehledná úprava. Dělám knihy a kalendáře naší široké rodině už roky, zatím jedna z nejlepších aplikací, co jsem kdy používala. | Trochu mě děsí, ze mám zaplatit tolik peněz za doručení a vůbec to po mne nechce nikam zadat e-mail. Kam mi přijdou informace o odeslání objednávky a jak mě bude kontaktovat dorucovaci společnost tady v ČR? Mám vše hotovo, ale platba se mi teda provádět nechce, tohle ve mě budí dost nedůvěryhodnosti. | Chtěla bych moc poděkovat kniha je dokonalá❣️ A aplikace opravdu super jen výběru fotky co chci a vše se samo urovná a já jen poupravila, opravdu jste mi moc ušetřili čas. Děkuji děkuji děkuji určitě budu objednávat pravidelně 🤍 | Během chvilky uděláte z fotek v mobilu krásnou vzpomínku... Během pár týdnů máte ve schránce... | Fotoknihy jsou pěkné, nenáročný a intuitivní návod. Doporučila jsem sestře a ta již také tvoří !😀👍 | Aplikace je prostě skvělá !!! Jednoduchá a originální příprava fotoknihy zabere oproti jiným aplikacím chvilku a výsledek je na jedničku. Stejně tak chválím kvalitu polaroidových fotek a pohlednic. Vřele všem DOPORUČUJI !! 😊❤️📸 | Velká spokojenost..aplikace přehledná a hlavně rychlá, kalendáře krásné a kvalitní. Trochu nás vylekal e-mail, že je náš balíček na celním, ale clo se nakonec vůbec neplatilo a i termín byl dodržen. Určitě objednám znovu..:) | No info on delivery day or time. Postman car only stopped before our house, without any attempt to call or ring the bell. No message on which post office is the parcel placed, so you need to investigate yourself. 45 minute queue to get it... You might have amazing product, however you ruin it all choosing wrong partner for the last mile... | Naprosto pohodlná aplikace. Vyberu fotky a samy se poskládají, rozvrhnou a velmi vkusně se doplní mapky s navštívenými místy. Všechno rychle a myslím, že i celkem za rozumnou cenu. Doporučuji!!! | Moje objednávka nedorazila včas(a ani nevim kdy dorazí | Aplikace mě zaujala a neustále mi na mail chodilo upozornění na slevu. Bohužel při vytvoření objednávky žádná sleva uplatnit nešla. Proč slibujete něco, co potom zákazník nedostane? Jednalo se o slevu na první objednávku, platila 7 dni, tudíž ještě 2 dny. | Již jsem vytvořila 2 fotoknihy a pracuji na dalších.
Stále se s aplikací učím a velmi oceňuji její jednoduchost.
Postrádám několik věcí:
- možnost přesunutí  fotek ve vybraném layoutu
- možnost dodatečného vložení mapy
- přidání textu k jednotlivým fotkám. Pokud přidám na stránku více textových polí je téměř nemožné docílit toho, aby popisovaly konkrétní fotku.

Jinak zpracování knihy je velmi kvalitní. Doba doručení v kolem 14 dnů - mohla by být kratší!

A dotaz na vývojáře na závěr: neuvažujeme o možnosti vložení ručně psaných textů (Apple Pencil)??? | Jsem zklamaná se servisem, který mi nemohl oddělit jména od data, ani samotné je to nenapadlo, ale hned měli řešení ze vyrobí novou knihu se slevou 50%. A ještě budu platit clo! Jsou lepší aplikace, za me tato ne!!! | Nikdy jsem knihy a kalendáře s fotografií nedělala protože mi to přišlo velmi pracné. Nyní dělám fotoknihy z každé zajímavé události. Vynikající aplikace. Jen je před odesláním nutné vše raději dvakrát zkontrolovat.",4.76796,1086,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ab/15/54/ab15541d-01ba-6d94-4dc4-ef06acb5de3d/75015d16-1413-4f32-b87b-38c24e88db2d_IOS_55-1.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/a7/18/71/a71871f7-acae-b17e-02d9-a41e4428bcd5/df1cd503-9cc8-4694-a3da-b48020102135_IOS_55-2.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/61/18/7c/61187c6c-91cf-303c-6ddb-b193c45277ba/02574bcf-c37c-476f-8acf-8f426efb9e97_IOS_55-3.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/3c/fa/b2/3cfab258-b3d1-80d1-3887-028dcf64a3d0/231374d6-e7ca-49c6-91f2-ee765da3f6ef_IOS_55-5.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/b1/89/2e/b1892ed1-06c8-36a0-5923-f4da8c76538d/e85b9d05-0c52-4b72-aa2e-e5ebfe6d6c01_IOS_55-4.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/46/c1/b3/46c1b355-a075-1ed4-86c9-1e4795272e99/8ddf46a7-d090-43ab-874f-ee4e404accab_IOS_55-91.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/48/e5/29/48e52958-819e-45b6-5a31-b1b88e38e70f/7513e421-0bd1-47d9-844f-e0c70579a38c_IOS_55-6.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/c9/5d/5e/c95d5ee9-cc10-4d70-9533-5d74de597a2b/c6894c75-29c9-4820-b586-fc665a2db028_IOS_55-7.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/fa/19/77/fa19773d-3d83-5cfd-96b8-d29cdfc9c6ad/905070b1-f17e-422e-b647-c0010c27d9db_IOS_55-8.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4a/d3/6f/4ad36fa6-5b67-c021-094a-ba1cbf772392/c1f6ccc9-be38-493a-8b48-af5644c89c33_IOS_55-9.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/db/4e/d9/db4ed9c9-e422-697f-2b9d-17e8604415a0/cfce9510-0ceb-41df-aa29-43672d137ed8_IOS_IPAD_PRO-1.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/69/f4/06/69f406df-fce8-0dd0-d613-68b494d50856/78e60ec2-2d75-489b-952d-d7ad9d14ed51_IOS_IPAD_PRO-2.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/a8/b2/eb/a8b2ebf9-4a8d-b9fc-560c-e1bdd002024c/b1a1d1b5-2c42-4d1c-afac-6474cf03a5cd_IOS_IPAD_PRO-3.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/4a/29/35/4a293551-c4ea-6fc4-a930-42ff61bf4850/3ae54e55-f083-4056-b821-c9545d8874ea_IOS_IPAD_PRO-4.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/b7/cf/a0/b7cfa0fc-9399-29a3-2ce3-0f82c8800efe/0f10a1c9-ef88-4872-b1b4-bc995f980d00_IOS_IPAD_PRO-5.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/85/6f/96/856f96f1-b7ca-d769-9d13-181c1471c271/529e0b06-0375-4fa9-9bd3-ca7961759194_IOS_IPAD_PRO-6.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/12/30/1c/12301c50-af40-2e2c-58d3-2461218a05ee/fe7b18e5-b89b-4549-a923-db7d9148c3d3_IOS_IPAD_PRO-7.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/58/c9/52/58c952a7-9d88-a752-ae4e-5a3a636ac95f/a5967c72-e37d-43d5-88ab-1105081f3ab0_IOS_IPAD_PRO-9.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/99/45/be/9945be9b-0aec-1446-9575-0c5b5c2bac49/e82ba72a-41b7-411d-9c60-1f0a222be847_IOS_IPAD_PRO-8.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/0f/a3/b0/0fa3b095-158f-5a15-0ec3-fe758cfcf832/2c0135a4-7bb4-4d75-bdb2-f479d1e8f220_IOS_IPAD_PRO-91.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadP

1494159054,"cz.flyaway.flyaway","FlyAway","https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/flyaway/id1494159054?uo=4","Aplikace FlyAway vás upozorní na akční letenky už od 250 Kč. Levné letenky už nemusíte nikde hledat, aplikace FlyAway monitoruje levné letenky za vás.

V aplikaci publikujeme jen ty nejlepší nabídky akčních letů, které opravdu stojí za to.
Upozorníme vás pouze na lety s atraktivní slevou
Vybíráme hlavně přímé lety nebo s krátkým mezipřistáním
Bereme v úvahu ideální počet dní strávených v destinaci

V APLIKACI FLYAWAY REZERVUJTE LETENKY VŽDY ZA NEJNIŽŠÍ CENU

V aplikaci FlyAway letenky přímo neprodáváme (=nenavyšujeme ceny o svou provizi), vždy odkazujeme na rezervaci přímo u aerolinky. Jedině to je způsob, jak získat nejnižší cenu, nepřeplácet za doplňkové služby a v případě zpoždění či zrušení letů řešit transparentně a rychle refundace a jiné požadavky.

VLASTNÍ FILTRY

V aplikaci si můžete nastavit své nejbližší odletové letiště a dostávat tak upozornění na letenky, které jsou pro vás nejvýhodnější.

K tomu si můžete nastavit sledování akčních letenek i z okolních letišť, která jsou brána jako sekundární letiště a upozornění dostanete vždy pouze na lety, které se výrazně vyplatí i s ohledem na dopravu.

Dále si můžete nastavit destinace, které chcete sledovat a dostávat upozornění na akční letenky jen do vybraných destinací.

ITINERÁŘE

Kromě akčních letenek v aplikaci najdete také připravené itineráře do různých destinací. Stačí rezervovat svůj let a vydat se na cestu s připraveným itinerářem.

DETAILNÍ INFORMACE KE KAŽDÉ LETENCE

U každé letenky vždy vidíte:
Počasí v destinaci na termín cesty
Základní info o destinaci
Termín letu
Rozmezí dnů, kdy je let operován
Cenu a odkaz na rezervaci
Počet dní strávených v destinaci
Rozměr zavazadel a případné příplatky za příruční, či odbavené zavazadlo
Informace o případných přestupech
COVID podmínky vstupu a návratu

ZÁKAZNICKÁ PODPORA

V aplikaci je dostupný live chat k vašim dotazům, na kterém jsme každý pracovní den od 9 do 18 h.

Pokud máte jakékoliv dotazy, můžete se také obrátit na naši podporu na emailu podpora@fly-away.cz

There’s plenty of free resources online, save your money. | Po instalaci jsou nabidky jen pro platinove uzivatele. Ano je pravda ze nikdo nesliboval ze mi za sdeleni emailu a registraci neco daji 😀 jako treba typy a na letenky 😀))  Inu chce to lepe cist a jen to co je psane a ne se nechat zase napalit. Kazdy by si mel u kazdeho sw precist podminky a nejlepe jeste pred tum nez zadate email a jina data. Pekny den. | Every single offer is visible only if you have a premium account. | Napomocna appka pro cestovatele. Skvela je volba vyberu zemi kam si hledate letenky. Poridila jsem uz par vikendovych letenek. Doporucuji 🙂 | Stáhnout lze zdarma, ale pokud nezaplatíte, vidíte jen nadpisy a nic víc…. Takže k ničemu. | Mega spam, prices are usually higher than with the airline. | Zbytečná, drahá aplikace. Pořád ty samé letenky : Krakow, Rinini, Paříž, Lyon... 
Ty samé najdete zdarma všude a velice často, nejsou to tedy nejake super akce.. | вам прийдеться спочатку зареєструватись (WTF?!), а потім ви дізнаєтесь що вам прийдеться заплатити місячну чи річну підписку, щоб подивитись деталі польоту (WTF?!?!?!) | Aplikace k ničemu, jen aby jste jim platili. 🤦🏻 | Koupil jsem letenky do Prarize za 1200 kc. | Super aplikace díky které mám možnost objevit letenky za super ceny i na místa, které by mě samotného nenapadla. V jednoduchosti je krása a to je právě tento případ :).
Doporučuji!!! | Just registered and straight after I need to pay. 
They will squeeze ur pockets. | K používání aplikace ke nutné placený Premium účet…. | “Aplikace zpoplatněna není”, to sice ne, ale bez premium účtu za 99 měsíčně je k ničemu :D | Bez premium účtu je to úplně k ničemu | Přehledná a uživatelsky přívětivá aplikace s pefektními upozorněními na lákavé destinace za hubičku. Dává přesně tolik kolik je potřeba a neotravuje s ničím navíc 🙂  | A useless app . You need to pay premium for start working . All other site’s like students agency or pelican is showing better offer than this | Bez placení 99kc/mesicne (ucet premium) je Vam appka k nicemu, nic se z ni nedozvite👎🏻 | You must pay or you see nothing... hate app like this...sometimes you just want to try for a while...... | Unless you pay for premium, the app is useless. No idea how it works if you do have the premium. I hate when they do that! | Nejde mi smazat účet, chce to po mě opsat kód a i když ho opíšu úplně přesně tak to hodí chybu. | Bohuzel - nebyl jsem úspěšný ani po znovunainstalovani a restartu telefonu xxx update: nakonec jsem se tam dostal, ale zrušilo mi to předplatné 😳 | Jak u vás zruším účet? Akční letenky lze náhorní zdarma na jiných stránkách | Chcete tip na letenky? Tak si musíte platit předplatné 99,- Kč/ měs. Jinak mate smůlu..
Klidně bych si aplikaci koupil, ale předplatné, to snad ne.. 🙈 | Aplikace zpoplatněna 99kc/měsíc. Na začátku o tom neinformují. Když by raději měli provizi z zakoupené letenky.
Odinstaluji a nedoporučuji. | Aplikace ohromí skvělými cenami letenek. Ty však nejsou v ceně se zpáteční, jsou jen s malým zavazadlem (a to navíc jen kabelka/malý batoh pod sedačku, nikoliv 10kg palubní zavazadlo). Například letenky do Norska, nabízené za 490 kč, vyjdou nakonec na více než 2 tisíce. Ceny letenek v aplikaci mnohdy také nesouhlasí s aktuální nabídkou od leteckých společností.
Pro krátké shrnutí, aplikace je zklamáním. | Perfektni přehledná a hlavně funkci aplikace. Neskutečné nabídky letenek, díky kterým dostane cestování jiny rozměr a usetri vám tisíce. Za me nejlepší aplikace tohoto druhu. | Skvělý a aktuální přehled o akčních letech. Pokud cestujete, tak doporučuji! | Super appka co ušetří čas i peníze na hledání a koupi letenek ❤️🙌🏼 

Nice, easy, good for travelers 💙 | Flyaway, záruka perfektní dovolené.
Flyaway, guarantee of perfect vacation. | Dostavam upozorneni na paradni ceny letenek, casto opravdu za 2 nebo 3 stovky. 👍🏻👍🏻 | Perfektní appka, kde lze vybrat ty nejlepší letenky a hlavně všechno je perfektně přehledné 😉😉 | Ověřovací kód na e-mail nedojde, není tedy možnost aplikaci vyuzivat. | Podvodna aplikace, ktera se tvari jako vyhledavac letenek. Nabidky jsou bezne dostupne u jinych webu a aplikaci a to bez poplatku. Navic si uchovaji detaily vasi karty a ikdyz predplatne zrusite a zabolujete na gopay, stejne penize odectou. Komunikace zadna. Resim s policii, je nas takovych vic. | Něco takového jsem potřeboval, makám na sobě , mám velké cíle a ambice a hledání těch nejlepších letenek může zabrat pár hodin, zde mám vše na jednom místě s informacemi který potřebuju, teď konkrétně ohledně COVIDU😎 | Letenky  pouze po zaplacení 😡 | Tento projekt dokáže člověku dozajista ušetřit spoustu peněz za letenky. Nicméně je tu jedno ale, které mi brání v prodloužení předplatného - téměř veškeré z nabízených akcí bývají X hodin před zveřejněním v aplikaci uvedeny na webu cestujlevne.com, kde se k letenkám dostane každý zdarma. Nechci, aby to uživatelé špatně pochopili - rád finančně podpořím kohokoli, kdo mne dostane do zahraničí za hubičku. Člověk si ale nutně musí položit otázku, zda nápady tvůrců FlyAway jsou skutečně jejich nápady. | Aplikace nema free obsah vse je placene, kdyby aspon nejaka letenka mela free detail nereknu, ale hned placeny obsah. Ani jednoduse se to neda koupit, odkazuji na web mimo aplikaci ok nechteji platit provizi applu chapu, ale aspon mejte sakra tlacitko na webu koupit hledat to fakt nebudu | Super možnost jak vybrat dovolenou a ušetřit na letenkách i několik tisíc. Výhodou jsou notifikace vyfiltrovaných destinací, rozhodně lepší než letenky na mail. Doporučuji | Skvělé, jednoduché, praktické a  krásně přehledné. Děkujeme | Dobra appka | Hezká přehlednost aplikace, aktualizace nových destinací každý den 🤩👍🏻 | Helpful app which saves you time spend searching cheap flights. Easy to use. | Líbí se mi možnost filtrování. | Jednoduché a praktické ovládání. Super. | Přehledná aplikace, vhodná pro všechny cestovatele, kteří chtějí cestovat lowcost!

Memrise had a great and working space repetition system, but now I need to review thousands of words and I simple cannot unless I learn dozens of new words first… why???
The app got much worse with the recent updates, some content is great, but if you want to actually learn, you need to remember and Memrise now helps you forget, not remember:/ | Due to the cancellation of the community courses in app, I have to switch to another app. Memrise, please consider changing and returning the community courses in the app. In web browser it is very uncomfortable. :-( | The best app for foreing language words learning... until they decided to remove the community courses in February-March 2024. The Memrise website is really not as good as app for learning and I won’t continue with my subscription when the current one ends in a month. | They decided to remove community curses, the only reason why they were able to make community base, now it’s ruined, don’t even bother to download | Hi,
I have to say that this is a great learning app, genuinely being able to teach you the language that you want and I’ve had a great time with this app, however the recent updates removed the total words known feature, which is a shame in my opinion since it helps me track how much I know of the language I am learning. Could you please readd this feature? | Nenašla jsem po instalaci výchozí jazyk češtinu, přestože jsem na videu viděla, ze by ji aplikace měla mít jako výchozí jazyk k dispozici. Už tomu tak není? | The new version of Memrise is terrible. Because of the new version and the pointless effort to improve the application, I lost dozens of created courses and thousands of words with translations. | Memrise was great and is still very good, but recent changes absolutely crippled it. For instance, due to being busy I did not have time to practice for about a week. I want to really review what I’ve learned, but I have to simply go through this tedious gpt chat, video watching AND learning new words ‘questy’ thingy before being offered review. Guys, I’m paying for this and you made the app way less user friendly, make the questy crap optional!!! Some more exclamation marks!!! | I love this app and I have the membership but after finishing the German 1 course I can’t practice the German 2 in my app. I can only access the course via website. I tried to reinstall the app but it didn’t help… | Please bring back the old design of the main page! 

It was so much better when I could choose whether to learn new words, review or practice difficult words! Now it’s out of my control and I just keep clicking through the options vocabulary-listening-conversation hoping that at some point the vocabulary tab will give me what I need (reviews/new words/difficult words). 

My study time has gone down a lot since you introduced the new design because it is not user friendly and I end up feeling annoyed and frustrated😭 

I also miss having the streak and number of words I already know visible on the main page. 

I love Memrise app so much and the main page from which I decide what to learn today is the biggest part of it. I am really hoping you will change it back :( | Za mne, nejlepší aplikace na procvicovani spolu s prohlubovacim kurzem | All you need is a membership and some consistency. I’ve been using the Memrise app for many years and I love it. | App without Czech launguage.. | Asi jediná aplikace, do které jsem s radostí investovala peníze a nelituji toho. | Perfect app to learn the real, useful language. | I speak “Ukrainian” and I want to speak “English”. I don’t want to choose russian language. And don’t know Chinese or Spanish to starting using your app. | Best language learning app!! I really love the videos and audio spoken by the locals, so great to hear the real accent! 🖤 However, from the last update, it keeps freezing sometimes, especially during videos and then the voice is lost and I have to reset the app and loose the progress :( I'm using iphone. | Perfect add for learning a language, but with annoying ads. | Zatím používám asi týden na španělštinu a je to parádní. Skutečné audio plus hromada krátkých videí výuku dost oživuje a zlepšuje. Celkový učební plán vypadá taky super. Rovnou jsem koupil full verzi která je za dobré peníze. Kombinuju to dohromady s Duolingem... | Používám teda zatím jen chvíli, ale doposud jsem nenašel nic co by mi jakkoli vadilo. Je to přehledné, a fakt účinné ;) | Thanks for the info 👍❤️❤️ | Mem Rise is a really good language learning app
Download it now if you haven’t yet | It is good app but when I have only a little mistake in spelling or something like this it a mistake. 
I do it a long time and it is very annoying when the sound of speaking is still same. Bye and thanks for repairing this mistakes. | Great app🤩 | I like its minimalist design + it is a nice way to improve language that I learn! And it is free :)

Thanks for this one <3 | Nemůžu smazat slovo z databáze testu, který jsem vytvořila

Can teach you lot 
Thought out 
One think only one thing is missing....vocabulary. | Už s Memrise procvičuju půl roku a pořád mě to baví | Výborná aplikace, lze si procvičovat několik jazyku na jednou. Bohužel některé možnosti jsou placené. | Its not free like Duolingo, bud I feel it is better thought through | Awesome app but i would like to learn german in czech language. | Definitely the best app for learning vocabulary. 5/5 | New design update is just terrible. Isn’t it too late for April’s fool jokes? Unfortunately it’s not...it is this rare case, when new design makes it look less fresh. It is so generic, blank and characterless that I am seriously considering canceling my year subscription plan, because of it. I can’t understand why would you trade your originality for stupid cartoon like design, which every language app has got nowadays. If this is the type of decisions that are being made, I am afraid of what will come next. It is such a big pity, because app was SO GOOD, the the downfall is just crazy.....sad | The new colors are awful 🤢 | The new design is terrible! | I really like this app, BUT this new update, I HATE the design, I was working on it, because i felt like I was going more up to the space, but now? Just bluish dots? No, please take it back. | Hello, I would be very pleased to update to the Czech language. | Really amazing app, use it for all of my vocabulary studies. However, I mostly create my own decks and one thing I miss a lot with this app is something like an automatic audio. Since the language I learn on there is Japanese, it is necessary for me and searching for it and adding it manually takes hours. If I didn’t have to do that anymore, the app would be perfect. | Why still similar application need i-net. connection? Many people want to learn languages, not pay for anything and register themself. 
Secondly - there’s not czech language. | Doporučuji je to amazing :-) začínal jsem s duolingem , ale English Hacker s Memrise je  perfektní , protože Markéta to perfektně vysvětluje. | This app is really fun and it teaches you something!!! | Im learning Swedish | I use Memrise for some years already and I do pay yearly fee to benefit from some add on and also to support developpers ... but I’m fed up. I have and I use plenty of apps, so I can easily say, there is probably not other app with so frequent updates and  ... problem is that almost each version brings new problems, bugs and seldom fix the old ... can’t you do little bit more testing? This might be my last year I do pay if there is no new approach in development. 
PS: it would also help to have button to report wrong translation as there are too many | I just payed full version which 80% of the time does not work. If I have offline learning, there is error 101. If online version, it happenes error no connection. But internet conection works very well (data also wi-fi) | the application is not yet in Czech | When can we expect to study Czech Language here??? Please | I want to learn English but speak czech... so I can’t use this app but I would like, so add czech! :-D | Lepší než všechny dosavadní app a dá se používat zdarma.

Nebo už je někde. | Perfect app. Thank you | Great!!!!! | I just cant stand the constant advertising. | Je to skvělé! | Dal bych vám více hvězdiček ale musí se platit | Add current time and date (+dayname) at the top-right corner in widget with bold and bigger font please. It would be very useful to have all important info in one view. Thanks. | The app keeps asking for payment every now and then despite of having active annual  proposition. iPhone app in metric units and apple watch in imperial ??? no setting for watch app. +no localisation +sparse meteo network. | Aplication was great before. 
Today 12.9.2020 starts app crashing at iphone 12 pro in io 14.2.1 | Super | ...the best feature gone :-( and works no more | Jsem naprosto spokojená. | Větší přehlednost méně reklam | Chybí my překlad do češtiny jinak nej počasí. | There is no forecast, only numbers randomly generated. Based on long going research and comparsion. | In App Store it seems like free. First screen si price list. | They pop up frequently premium service and you can purchase mistakenly | Výborná aplikace na předpověď počasí, která podporuje i Apple Watch.
Škoda, že není v češtině. | App is very nice and true. | Chci se zeptat na cestinu. Je k dispozici? | Super apka, skoda jen, ze není v češtině ... | Ukazuje to skoro stejné předpovědi jako “počasí”, ale navíc ukazuje upozornění, rain radar a další. Bohužel vývojáři asi mají hluboko do kapsy, a tak se vám asi každou minutu zobrazí nějaká reklama(buď třiceti sekundová, nebo nabídka na sedmi denní trial...) | If you download the app, the preset is for weekly 3 USD payment. After trial period this continues and you continue to pay also also when you delete the app. It is quite fine app but this approach is like some scammers do... | Samá reklama a ještě to ukazuje blbě. Když venku 20, tak ukazuje 16. Ostatní app ukazují 20. Moře jiných app o počasí a tato je někde na chvostu. | Až na ty kvanta neustále otravujicich reklam.. 😩 | Chci se toho zbavit,ale nevím jak. | Než jsem sjel úplně dolů na kompletní předpověď, tak jsem napočítal 4 reklamy, které dost narušovaly celkový vzhled aplikace (který věřím, že je jinak povedený). Pokud chce vývojář nalákat na koupi premium verze, tak zvolil špatný přístup. Aplikaci mě donutil hned po dvou minutách odinstalovat a napsat tuto recenzi (recenze píšu jen když se mi něco moc líbí, nebo nelíbí). | Nevím jak zastavit platbu. | Za kazdy mesic pouzivani aplikace 200kc,je okradani. | Skvěle rozšířené a perfektní grafické provedení doporučuji | Super aplikace | Works good | Dobra aplikace na pocasi | Super | More informations than a default weather app, but should be more exact of locations. First automatic update was done at area of my job, but I'm living in the other part of the city and there is no update.

Edit: I don't understand why I still see some numbers in a red circle at the upper right app icon. I have read all informations and don't know what I may to do more for disappearing those annoying numbers. | Dobrá,škoda že né v češtině a samá reklama | The temperature does not fit perfectly with the actual temperature. | Výborná aplikace!!! | Super apka | 👍👍👍 | K dokonalosti už chybí jen čeština | Super 👍 | Opravdu pěkné😂 | Zatím aplikaci užívám jen krátce, ale zdá se povedená. | Krásně zpracovaná  applikace! Ze super animacema.👍 | Aplikace je graficky velice povedená. Jen pochybuji, že se jedna o předpověď počasí. Koukám z okna a venku krásné počasí, akorát aplikace ukazuje déšť. Aplikace hlásí, že si mám připravit deštník, ale venku je slunečno. V podstatě se to řídí tím co uživatele odešlou. | Best Weather",4.51947,2697,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/c1/73/4f/c1734fdd-a32a-d135-2f4f-734daa7f4d56/0a416a3b-549e-4135-a425-d76718acca58_iphone5.5_s1_en-GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/e5/f1/4a/e5f14a0b-3cee-f474-d5c8-1d8d60dc4c56/5f2963de-0d6f-4574-8fd6-00552c625fb6_iphone5.5_s2_en-GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/61/49/13/614913a4-6875-32f6-e6a1-36af565ca242/f9a34da5-61d7-48b1-9f93-de76383051c6_iphone5.5_s3_en-GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/6b/b3/73/6bb373b2-a4ed-a781-e2da-0369e43ec6ee/8e21b640-5e23-41ef-bca6-9030b4ee225d_iphone5.5_s4_en-GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5f/aa/fb/5faafbf3-0e85-f100-cbb6-3dbd9a40437d/27ac745e-2d61-41b1-afe8-e34fffea0671_iphone5.5_s5_en-GB.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/9c/8d/cb/9c8dcb95-9276-64a8-440d-cd99fcdd0f46/31d83fc3-4e69-4983-a12a-20f24f727754_ipad12.9_U00282_U0029_s1_en-UK.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/77/a8/d5/77a8d5ed-1f5d-715d-6669-1f0d11252fce/a1d9d06c-cb6f-4cfb-bcf5-e0ab66287a14_ipad12.9_U00282_U0029_s2_en-UK.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/5e/72/97/5e729719-c12b-9bd4-7360-ed9fe51d7de3/1f9b3b4b-e56b-4e91-a7fe-f8bb8402464b_ipad12.9_U00282_U0029_s3_en-UK.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ea/10/24/ea102471-7915-4c77-5092-2300c4d0d028/a924ce6c-284c-4bca-9746-770882216e8b_ipad12.9_U00282_U0029_s4_en-UK.jpg/576x768bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/a6/1d/7f/a61d7f4e-4a33-0cdb-b377-c453cea744ae/986bd44b-c6b8-4b7e-9e13-0415b3bd3644_ipad12.9_U00282_U0029_s5_en-UK.jpg/576x768bb.jpg""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I appreciate especially grammar exercises that are better prepared than for example in Duolingo. I am missing english learning from english - it is not possible. You have to speak different language to have option to learn english. However choice of other languages is limited. | Chybí podpora češtiny, nepoužitelne, lepší duolingo nebo jina konkurence | Platím si druhým rokem včetně neomezenych Live lekcí a díky tomu je progress při učení skutečně slušný. | Aplikace v plné verzi funguje spolehlivě a má krásný design. Společně s Duolingem velmi uživatelsky přívětivé aplikace na podporu učení cizích jazyků. | Je to asi nejlepší aplikace na výuku jazyků, kterou znám. Tady jen neopakuji slovíčka, ale opravdu se učím pracovat na gramatice a celkovém proniknutí do jazyka. Líbí se mi, jak si tvůrci vyhráli s namluvením rozhovorů, je to zábavné. Nevýhodou je platba za každý jazyk zvlášť,ale pokud se člověk rozhodne dělat pořádně jeden jazyk, je toto skvělá volba. | Після години використання iphone xs гріється так ніби я граю в pubg і додаток починає сильно глючити | I speak Czech, I want to learn English. I can’t even get through the initial setup | Občas padá, chtělo by to víc podcastů k poslechu. Jinak se mi líbí oddělené běžné lekce a lekce gramatiky, koncepce opakování - škoda, že se tam nedají ondividuálně přidat oblíbené věty z rozhovorů, které opravdu působí přirozeně a užitečně. Super aplikace. | I like my studying with babbel with this app. It's pretty well designed and easy to use. Just one thing I would like to see in newer versions: ways to report mistakes in lessons (doesn't happen often but spotted one at least once in the German course). | Good app! Miles better than its more well known competitor. There are two issues however: it is not possible to use writing with German without German keyboard. I'm not going to install it and I'd prefer the option to have reviews and stuff ignore umlauts and accept double S for gross S. Also it doesn't seem possible to configure I only ever wanna use writing in reviews. I have to select it every time. I use the app on the go without headphones and I'm not going to be listening to my phone aloud nor talking to out while out and about.

Update: The Babbel support is not very good. Downgraded the review to 3 stars not 4. | Excelente! Muchas gracias “nach” Berlin ☀️👍 | En lo personal, si eres una persona dedicada, luego de varias semanas de haber comenzando con la lengua italiana, comencé ya a estructurar oraciones con los verbos aprendidos y a mejorar mi fluidez. Definitivamente para comenzar la plataforma es recomendable. | If you look to learn Russian beyond A1, this is not the app you are looking for. | I enjoy getting back to learning foreign languages many years after my last attempt. It's not meant for linguists, but for an early start of speaking without being unconfident shy or whatever. Some essential simple grammar lightly infiltrates basic conversational topics. The course is far from being steep. Cons: * AFAIK no possibility not to start from scratch. * I miss Japanese. * My doughter would be glad to use Babbel to learn English based on Czech language, but it's not available (yet?). | The content is great but the app is wonky. Cant get iPad widget to work. | I learn Danish and I love it, the coversations (listening) and explanation of Danish lifestyle and tradition. I wish Babbel expand to Hebrew too! Are you planning to add Hebrew? Please consider it! | it’s very easy to use and it helps me to learn GER 👍 | very quick, efficient, funny, perfect graphics | When I do review with speaking it very often very poorly  recognizes my speaking, for Spanish. You can say whole sentence 5 times and always recognizes some nonsense words. But what is absolutely nonsense is that after you pres next it does no play the correct pronaunciation at all! Why it plays correct when you speak it correct and does no show you correct when you have troubles to say it!? | when you choose a language, it doesen't even ask you what your level is, you just start from the most basics and you need to go through it to unlock other lessons. if you dont pay, you can only play one lesson in which you learn how to say hello, please, good bye and yes. then you have to pay. its funny because even google translator teaches you more than this funny application that only cares about money. it would make a better sense if you put ads and by this way got the money, but forcing people who are trying to learn a language to pay right from the start is weird. | Everything works rather well, even the sync. Only problem I can’t get trough is the mic part. It’s absolutely random or too sensitive to for the sentence phonology. | The lessons are awesome. However after each exercise there is a lot of waiting till you get to a next slide. It makes it a little bit boring. But still worth it. | 3* - I am seriously missing this feature. When learning new words and expressions in Babbel, I want to add these to my note taking app open another window, having both apps side-by-side. Please implement it as soon as possible. I believe many iPad users will find it beneficial and practical. Thank you | I am happy with the language courses and options to learn. 

But please, make the in app keyboard more responsive like the iOS keyboard. It’s insanely slow and inaccurate when writing and it just drives me crazy to rewrite half of my inputs | I have been using the app for French for a while. At the beginning just the app (started from very basics), now (last 3 months) as a supplement for the official French course I am attending at language institute (A2). 

I am trying to do one lesson a day (10 min tops) in the app and I can say it follows the learning plan of my official course. I have got a bit ahead with a grammar in it ( the app explains it really well), so now I am basically reviewing stuff on class, which really helps me to build the knowledge fast. | Why the Review option is not available all the time? I wold like to review what I learned as much as I need before moving to the next lesson. Now I have to either repeat the whole lesson or just listen to all of the words one by one. It is very inconvenient. | This is a really good app, I tried to learn to speak italian. I remebered the first four words very quickly - but I cannot learn more - it needs to be upgraded to premium. I liked this app, but I don’t think it is worth so much money. | Please atd czech language. App is great but for Czech peoples is unusable. Thank you | I wrote once a word that the French guys are talking too quickly and I have the feeling that you slowdowned the Spanish ones :-)))) which we’re totally fine! I wish that the FRENCH speakers would talk way more clearly!!! Especially for the beginner like me is really difficult to catch the words they are saying even with listening again :-( 

But still very satisfied and happy to learn two nice languages, keep improving! | Die Lektionen sind zwar gut aufgebaut, jedoch fehlen mehr Übungen, um die wörte und Gramatik zu einprägen. | Hi, could you please add Japanese? I like the app and would like to try it, but I want to learn only Japanese. Thanks :) | Great app! I really like the way it teaches! It touches all the learning ways - through listening, writing, hearing and translating. Chapeau! | This app is great example of pure stupidity. I wanted to improve my english but you can ´t choose English as a language you wanted to learn........... 
Please use common sense or don ´t release unfinished apps. | I wanna practice my english but I cant chose to have this app in English language too. Could u do something with that? | Please add Czech. I want learn english but im from czech republic | A nicely done app, with useful vocabulary and varied exercises, a great tool for learning a little bit every day! | Great UI, the best way for language self learning. | This is really a 21st century way of learning languages. | Pro čecha, který si chce zlepšit angličtinu, nepoužitelné. Češtinu v této aplikaci nehledejte. | I was going to Brazil, so I paid for subscription for three months, My Phone get stollen and I forgot about it. They charged my several times before I noticed. No email, no thanks for paying. It's quite a trap so be careful about it !!! | I am learning German on this app an so far I like it. I would change order of some lessons but I general great. It learns you how to write, speak (improvement needed here as well, but this is issues for all apps that are using the same thing). Love it, affordable and recommend it! 4* from me since improvements are always welcome | The continue button after each part doesn't appear and it is not a possible finish a lesson.

Wasted money... | I just installed it. It is simple to learn basic words and grammar rules, however, I will see how it could explain more complicated

The only con is that if you don’t want to be bothered by optional videos in order to open the next section, you need to pay monthly fees, which are affordable, but more free exercises would be better. Overall thanks. | Supr Appka na učení jazyků. Učila jsem se německy před tím než jsem odjela na půl roku do Německa pracovně. Zkoušela jsem víc aplikací/ kurzů a nic lepšího jsem nenašla. Velmi doporučuji | Super aplikace na procvičení angličtiny. Krátká videa v angličtině a pak cvičení. Možnost zdarma. Super. | Very good to learn English for me! | Love it | the only spanish leading app i will never pay and not regret it! | Engaging learning in correct level. The app I didn’t hesitate to pay subscription. Worth the investment. | Jsem moc spokojena. 
Učím se anglicky na úrovni b2 a začala jsem s holandstinou. Je to snadné i pro úplného zacatecnika, stejne tak motivující pro pokročilého. | Super | It´s a very good educational app. It has a few little bugs, but when you want to learn some of main languages, it is a way better than Duolingo. | Jsem moc spokojená,takhle appka je mnohem lepší, než konkurenční Duolingo.. | Systém učení Busuu mně velmi vyhovuje, za rok jsem se naučil obstojně rozumět německy a domluvit se na dovolené. | I love the platform and the user friendly experience. C’est magnifique. I got no complaining on how they teach the languages they offer. | This app is very complex, I enjoy learnng with this. | Perfect app for everyday learning English! 🤩👍🏻 | That’s the perfect app for repeating some usual phrases and catching up new ones. I like it! | First of all I have to say I only use the free version.
There are many pluses - native speakers in the whole course, grammar lessons (very useful!), listening and reading exercises, native people can correct your speaking/writing. 
But- I don’t feel like I remember a lot of words from it, which is kinda crucial in language-learning app:). I believe that’s because of the free version, there’s no repetition and therefore I see a new word once and then I forget it. There is some feature to train words but it’s really weird and seems very random to me.
I wouldn’t use it for studying as a primary app.
Could be worse, but could be better too though. | App is very helpful and great fun but their paid version ad annoying. | help me with my English, huge vocabulary + phrases + explanation. I recommend you try this app | I’ve used every app under the sun, and also as an English teacher I was surprised by how good Busuu is. I feel like I have actually improved my German in one week just by making sense of what I had seen but not completely understood before. Such a great choice! | This app is really good | Super aplikace | S aplikací jsem spokojená - jak po technické stránce tak i obsahové. Lze použít i bezplatně, pak ale nejsou k dispozici cvičení v lekcích. Zároveň oceňuji i komunikaci uživatelské podpory.
V porovnání s Duolingo jsou lekce delší, ale lépe vysvětlují gramatiku, super jsou konverzace zahrnuté do lekcí. | Dobré až na ty reklamy. Protože když se učím jazyk tak mě to hrozně vyrušuje a nemohu se soustředit | This is just so awesome, its mixture of Duolingo- teaches writing system very nicely, but doesnt learn you any theory, and Drops- teaches words, but you can practise only for 5 minutes, then you need to wait 12 hours or pay

Thanks for keeping it free. | There is significant issue after the latest update. Voice record exercises do not work on iPhone 12 after the latest update. | My husband and I have been learning French to work in Switzerland. We absolutely love how all vocab is super high yield and natives correct your work! We have been getting premium version for 2 years now (and almost done with B2) and I can say, it’s worth every penny!!!! | Really | Naučím se s ní mnohem více gramatiky než ve škole a ještě mě to baví ;) | Great app for learning languages. | I am learning Japanese and German and its helping a lot :) | Skvělá app | It is great app | Very popular application, but there is no Ukrainian language. | Your enero can be corrected by natives and you can correct others in your mother tongue as well. I really love this community, you feel welcomed and it encourages you to keep going 💪🏼. 

PS: I have the free version and I would love to pay for more features | Die beste App, die hab ich gefunden. Es geht um die einzige App, wo kann ich direkt ins Niveau C1 springen und muss nicht mit dem Lernen  der Grundlagen wieder Zeit verlieren.   Und was kann ich empfehlen? Man soll die neue Wörter notieren und dann wiederholen, um die beste Ergebnisse zu erreichen. 

Best app for language learning, especially for intermediate or even C1 students. Thank you,  really great job! ❤️ | Wortho od that money! | I find it really useful. It is easy to practice every day by yourself through quizzes and you can also get in touch with teachers for private lessons. Those I haven’t tried yet but I’m planning to. | iPhone app have lot of bugs, and after 6 moths no big change or update. I can’t help
Others with correction. Setting study's plan doesn’t work as well. Some lessons are boring, meaning topic of lesson. From my point of view whole system of revision must be smarter and more focused for continuous learning key elements of English. Honestly the concept in general is good, but needs improvement to be best. If this improvement won’t come, I probably will not buy subscription next time any more. BR Jan | If you don’t mind paying subscription, this is much better option than Duolingo. I don’t feel tricked into learning by cheap addictive tricks. Just set my study plan, but learn at my own pace.

Milá, ochotná a příjemná obsluha. | Dnes se mi s vámi opět dobře cestovalo. Milá stevardka Nikola byla po celou dobu usměvavá a malé zpožděni cestu nijak neovlivnilo. | děkuji | If you travel with Leo Express it’s a must. If you don’t travel wit Leo express you should start. Good app, very nice travelling program with cash back option. 

And GIFs and tiny jokes from now and then are nice detail! | Při koupi jízdenky přes aplikaci a její storno se peníze nevrací, pouze ""Leo kredity"". Na to jsem nebyl nedostatecne nebo nijak upozorněn a tak to považuji za sprostý podvod. O tom, že mám nějaké kredity na účtu jsem se přitom dozvěděl jen náhodou, když jsem si na palubě něco koupil a obsluha po mě nechtěla zaplatit a já zapatral proč. Nebýt téhle náhody, tak mi peníze pravděpodobně za nějakou dobu propadnou.. | There is no option how to import already bought tickets into the app. | Velmi ochotná obsluha, aplikace na velmi dobré úrovni a skvělé propojení s věrnostním klubem, který přináší slevy na občerstvení v podobě připsaní Leo kreditů na osobní účet. Cestování s Leo a používání aplikace mohu jen doporučit. | Bylo by možné opravit chybu, že spoj nejde uložit jinam než do Apple kalendáře?
Nejen, že kalendář musí být povolen, ale i nastaven jako výchozí.

Díky za opravu | Jednoduchá ovladatelnost aplikace, pohodlná platba přes ApplePay a přidávání jízdenek do AplleWallet je skvělá věc. Díky za zjednodušení nákupu jízdenek online.😁 | Lepší než české dráhy. Ochotná obsluha, levnější jízdenky a komfort. Rozhodně doporučuji. | Aplikace mi dříve fungovala, ale po nějakém posledním updatu se mi nelze přihlásit přes Facebook, přesměruje mě to k otevření aplikace Facebooku a o povolení leoexpressu a poté se to vrátí zpět k možnosti, jak se přihlásit. | Ráda s nimi jezdím | Poslední dvě nebo tři aktualizace aplikace při každém kliknutí pro vyhledávání nebo objednávání jízdenky zavibruje. Je to dost obtěžující. Ocenila bych minimálně možnost vypnutí. | Pro všechny, co nejsou zvyklí na Pražské hlavní nádraží: není v kryté hale, ale pod širým nebem. Tak ať vám neujede jako mě “za zadkem” ;-) | Nejhorší nejvíc zasekana aplikace co mám v telefonu, porad vypadává, zavírá se, nacita, porad píšou ze aplikaci vylepšují a aktualizují přitom je porad stejně na nic, 5 minut na koupi jedné jízdenky je fakt extrem, chyba není určitě na mé straně protože i průvodčí se shodují ze je to chyba leoxpressu | Intuitivní aplikace, uživatelsky jednoduchá. Veškeré informace pohodlně na jednom místě. Velmi usnadňuje kontrolu jízdenek, správu zákaznického účtu a přehled o zpoždění nebo zrušení spojů. | Už víc, jak 3 roky vám nejde přes aplikaci spoj Pardubice - Olomouc a vice versa. Jediný funkční způsob jsou webowky, kde pokud je potřeba rychlé koupi přes mobil, tak to vůbec nefachá. 

1* | Bohužel se mi nepodařilo aplikaci ani jednou otevřít, okamžitě mi aplikace spadne. | Dobrý den dneska jsem svama cestovala a už nikdy více koupila jsem si jízdenku premium v domění že budu mít klid když je to klidná zóna.Ale opak je pravdou nastoupil Anglicky mluvící par celou dobu tu dělají bordel jako hrůza 4 hodiny utrpení děkuji za odpověď na shledanou. Jinak stevardka milá ochotna super věnovala se až na ten par to byla příjemná cesta děkuji | Po aktualizaci mi nejde zadat sleva pro invalidu 3. stupně. A bohužel není ani v nabídce, kde dříve byla. myslím si, že tam máte chybu a já si potřebuju koupit lístek jako invalida a ne za plné peníze. Tak s tím prosím něco udělejte.. | Widget není funkční, po koupi jízdenky se zobrazuje : “kam to bude dál”. | Aplikace v pohodě, vše funguje jak má, jen bych ocenil, kdybych si v sekci kreditová banka mohl uložit kódy poukazů a zůstatek na poukazu byl rovnou zobrazen. Aby nebylo nutné pokaždé zadávat kód. 
Děkuji. Tomáš | Po posledni aktualizaci je apka strasna. Nelze pouzit apple pay a pri vyberu jizdenky neni moznost ""jit o krok zpatky"" proste chybi sipka zpet nebo smazat jizdenku. Takze musim shodit celou aplikaci a zapnout ji znovu. | Přesto že mám ""marketingové notifikace"" vypnuté. Dostávám upozornění typu ""poslední šance 20% sleva"". Děkuji, ale ne děkuji. | Po poslední aktualizaci je appka výrazně rychlejší :) | A proč tady jako čekáme na nic? Vzkazuje Vojtěch Bajer z Nového Jičína.

Super, it was a long time, but after one year you do this, so great I’ll change my review from 3 star to 5 ⭐️👍😉 Thanks | Vlak tiše projel kolem. První a poslední (pokus o) jízdu s Leo expresem skončil fiaskem. App pouze drze vyžaduje registraci ve smile klubu a má minimální přidanou hodnotu. | Podporuje Apple Wallet a má pěkný stickery | Widgety ve verzi aplikace 4.2.2 na iOS 14.6 nefungují.. neustále zobrazují: “Where to next?” | Po poslední aktualizaci se aplikace pomalu načítá | Proč není aplikace v mém rodném jazyce? Děkuji za vaši reakci. | Spuštění aplikace trvá příliš dlouho, uvítal bych Apple Pay. U zakoupených jízdenek by bylo super vidět rezervované místo na mapce vlaku, případně umožněna jeho změna. | Dobrý den, při vyhledání spojení vyskočí upozornění “Trasa nenalezena”. Jak tento problém vyřešit ? Děkuji | This app didn’t notify me about train service interruption due to a planned event and running busses instead. | Voda zdarma a servis personálu JAKSI POKULHÁVÁ.  Stevard nemeľ ani ochotu se tu ukázat. Tak hlavně že byl schopnej říct ""kontrola jízdeneček"" ale že by byl schopnej donést tu pitomou vodu která je tu zdarma to ne.( o vodu jsem ho i sám požádal) | It’s really missing integration of the Apple Wallet services: boarding cards and Apple Pay. | Po poslední aktualizaci vše již funguje v naprostém pořádku.
Za mne fajn apka pro cestování s LeoExpressem.
Děkuji | Vlak mi projel i kdyz jsem cekal jsem 20
minut predem , pan na telefonu mi rekl ze proste projel ze se omlouva. Nikdy leo nejedu. | Pri rezervaci jizdenky ukazuje aplikace cca 5 volnych mist v economy tride a nefunguje platba kartou. 

V prohlizeci rezervace funguje normalne a ukazuje volnou cca 3/4 vlaku. Kartu jsem smazala, znovu pridala a funguje taky. 
Chvalim moznost platby paypalem. | Samotné cestování v economy třídě za 800 Kč v zápachu z WC je kvalitka. Bez obsluhy bez občerstvení. Co by člověk chtěl. Jako kompenzace nabídnuta 100. 👎🏻 BOOO. | After proceeding to payment getting only white page with no content. | Nakoupil pri ceste na vlak bez nutnosti PC. Chtelo by to jeste notifikace o zpozdeni. | S aplikací jsem velmi spokojená. Je mnohonásobně přehlednější než aplikace ostatních dopravců. | Konečně nemusím složitě hledat jízdenky v mejlu, takhle je mám všechny pohromadě 🥳 | S aplikaci jsem velmi spokojena. 😊 | Chybka rychle odstraněna, takže dobrý. 👍 | Intuitivní a přehledná aplikace, která se hodí na každou cestu. Proces zakoupení jízdenky bez zbytečných front opravdu oceňuji. Okamžité odbavení u vlaku s telefonem v ruce, další skvělá výhoda. Propojování minibusu a vlaku přímo v aplikaci je velmi pohodlné řešení, někdy neřešitelné situace. Za mne naprostá jednička. | Vse jiz vyřídím pomocí aplikace, funguje i na iPadu 👍 | Nákup jízdenky bez problému, je vidět, že se na aplikaci pracuje.",4.80589,577,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/cb/ef/d8/cbefd8fb-1c3d-6c75-d261-f77f1f717a62/9d3a8508-3b8b-4457-8e8c-673b47751646_iphone8_EN0.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/eb/66/6f/eb666f9e-1a1b-471e-fc04-c99b87f8864d/0060b6f9-4432-4e54-86b7-dc3bd3c83d3d_iphone8_EN1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/40/94/83/409483ac-1e38-f427-7204-df9a44a49ec1/0e49fb0d-1f80-4e47-b586-1b5ae1cfbc51_iphone8_EN2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/7f/d1/ed/7fd1ed88-8abd-d0c5-9c2e-af65846fc25c/7adfb999-3ed0-4da8-82d5-0ad729c2f7e6_iphone8_EN3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/2e/9f/ed/2e9fed7e-9d85-9dac-03a6-2e390803facb/2838b98f-db44-4961-8664-0965b7d59553_iphone8_EN4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/ad/9f/9f/ad9f9f4e-a5ba-5d47-4474-b1e2e3757ce7/de37eec6-bd60-420b-87ac-6d2229c76c5e_iphone8_EN5.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/d7/09/33/d7093334-433e-a636-38b5-f08f47f5cb20/12a2519d-82dc-43ee-833d-9de0d16366aa_iPad_0_EN.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/f2/63/f2/f263f22b-fd2d-c013-dc6b-71911536905e/8e1901c3-d1ec-42b0-8e1c-c0d3cc995111_iPad_1_EN.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/ec/63/8d/ec638d71-1c15-ca4d-565a-0b998e4dce39/499d7497-2e6a-475c-a660-332811d58484_iPad_2_EN.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/04/bc/e2/04bce285-b081-46b9-abbd-74ef39ff071d/9ee813db-98cd-48b4-b99d-7b07cb36f55e_iPad_3_EN.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/77/e2/6e/77e26e79-a0d3-6c79-7d36-bdec9324e522/b68fb900-59ea-45f8-9757-ad807c2fdcd9_iPad_4_EN.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

I use it everywhere I travel. Great for places with poor data connection. | Navigace je perfektni. Velkou chybou jsou caste aktualizace. Pokud si aplikace vyzada aktualizaci map, nelze navigaci pouzit, dokud nejsou mapy aktualizovany a to to prekvapeni vam v polsku na pumpe nepomuze dorazit pohodlne do cile. | You can’t register with a personal email, only via the big corporation accounts (google, apple, facebook etc) or with the telephone number which doesn’t work (operation not permitted).

Thanka and regards
M.Kouba | Provatela | Bezva appka 🤪👍 | Nová aktualizace je strašná!!! Nikdy jsem to neměla dělat… Zbytečně složité, nejdou ukládat aktuální polohy. Předtím bylo vše snadné a přehledné 😞 | Vše ok. Thanx | Such a good app it used to be. I use it couple years now. But.
After the last update it changed to be the nightmare. Personal notes were shortened to 200 or whatever small number of letters. 
The route planner with pin is just ridiculous. Before it worked 100%, now the same think lasts ages to do.
Saving places: are you just kissing me? I safe a place to one bookmark library. Then I edit it, and the app - by itself- changes the library to another one? And saving the place is another nightmare by itself, have to edit it 5 times when it finally accepts the changes I have done?

And I am really missing the guides option.

Why you do not stay with what you have and it worked great, and you change the app to something completely useless? | Super | Last update is not really improvement.
Some easy things got “more PR layout”. 
Can you return back these 2 simple functionlities, please? The rest of the app is super. Using for very very long time. | I use this app for a long time and I am not impressed with the redesign. The navigation mode keeps changing to car even though I am using walking for the whole day. I can’t also select the point to route to from the pins on map like I was before (Route from, then select and Route to). Now I have to position the pin which much worse UX. | Nej offkova mapa :) 
Diky :) | Super na cestování i funkce map | Highly recommended | Best map for travellers | Maps.me jsou pro Saudskou Arábii nepoužitelné, chybí silnice, občas i města, navigací nelze použit, nefunguje, mapa se buď nenactou vůbec, nebo načtení a “zatuhne l.
Podobný problém je i v Ománu.
Pro ostatní země světa mapy funguji excelentne, tuto aplikaci velice rada používám a jsem s ni nadmíru spokojena. | Super | It's no longer about map. It's about data collection, ads and features that have nothing in common with the map or navigation. Issues remain unresolved, maps are updated less frequently and navigation…well still the same as few years ago. It was a great app, but that time is over.
Luckily there's great alternative – Organic Maps. Pretty the same app, but without privacy intrusive features and with active development. | Nemužu už dodatečně upravovat vytvořené seznamy, proč? | Funguje skvěle, akorát mojí současnou polohu netrefí o 400 - 500 metrů. | Pecka👍 | Around the world with Maps.me 🔝 | Jednička 🤙🙏 | Kk | Please correct the map of Azerbaijan and reinstall Azeri toponyms, don’t play in aggressive nationalistic hands, just follow the international laws. I expect to use the product by a serious business which doesn’t play political games. | EDIT: Working with coordinates, navigation between custom points, etc. is back. So this is a great New Year's gift, thanks. 

[Where is very nice old UI, easy to use? New one is very strange.

In addition, I cannot enter coordinates, which I have used for many years. Only response on it is ""Noting found"" :-( ] | OK. You created great app which you destroyed in version 11 and save with version 12 what is in fact version 10 with updated GUI.
If you don't touch any elementary functions and GUI and will do only improvement updates I'll renew my subscription next year and give you 5 stars again! | I have used this app for a long time.. it was the best. But after new updatwith new GUI? One of the worst apps - its just not working smoothly, the performance is just the worst.. cannot use it for maps.. so what for? And the new look? Bleeh

Why why why why destroy such a super app :((( | I will never ever forgive myself updating this now useless offline map. I am a full time traveller and I used to pin every single spot along with my personal comment or further recommendation. Now it’s all gone! The new update doesn’t show the pins I’ve made through years and years of travelling. One would say it’s partly my fault trusting an app but I kept it as another travel diary and took it for granted. I literally feel like I’ve lost half of my memories. Not just the new version doesn’t work properly on my phone (iPhone SE) but it lacks all the tools that made me love the old version so much. | Terrible new update. It just doesn’t work now on my phone properly. Always hangs. Used to be my favorite map app though, very very sad. 
3 stars only because I really liked the app before the update. | V nové verzi zmizely funkce pro které

Truly setting a low bar. | Worst app ever!! | Bookings cannot be added with booking reference and surname. On PC everything works. Check it and it will be 5* | I couldn’t find out the card number.

clear what to do steps | Tried so many airline apps, but this one is truly the worst. Nothing works, tried to add profile details 5 times already, still doesn’t save any info, looks like save button is just broken. Everything moves around randomly, like it is non optimised website not an application.

Ακόμα και ακυρωμένες πτήσεις μπορούν να διαχειριστούν σε πραγματικό χρόνο, ο ιμάντας άφιξης αποσκευές δίνεται, η θύρα δίνεται νωρίτερα και από το αεροδρόμιο κτλ | Pro každého kdo letí s touto leteckou společností je tahle aplikace téměř nutnost.Je zde vše potřebné a její design je intuitivní a čistý.Také chválim podporu s Apple Wallet | Missing direct input of points for Miles & More card | The apt has all the features i need 👍 | Odpovida potrebam. | Very easy to use when booking flights or simply checking in. Boarding passes can be saved within the Lufthansa app or in Apple Wallet. Via the app, you can also access your Miles & More account. Super. Also works with iWatch. | Cannot download my boarding pass | I use many others but this is the best airline App | The worst app from usability perspective.

Also design is nice. | I love this app :-) | ..on my iphone 5,ios 6 | Essential App for traveling | Odporúčam. | A very useful application | Info about types of aircrafts are missing. | Practical, saw lots of people on the airport using it. | Ok | Komplikované a nefungující | Good app for online check-in; nice 'aviatic-like' gui :) | Like it quite a lot.

V ten moment nechcete obtížně hledat zelenou kartu v přihrádkách, nebo ještě hůř, dostat pokutu za to, že nejste schopní předložit doklad o pojištění. Řešením je mít k dispozici důkaz o povinném ručení přímo v telefonu. V Čechách je nyní možné při silniční kontrole předložit zelenou kartu v elektronické podobě na displeji mobilního telefonu.

Jak na to?
- Jednoduše v aplikaci vyfoťte zelenou kartu od svého vozu,
- zadejte datum její expirace,
- trefně ji pojmenujte, ať se v tom vyznáte.

Mám přehled o všech autech. Ještě by bylo vhodné doplnit výměny olejů. | 1🥇👍 | Aplikace dělá to co má a dělá to perfektně. Dík za to | Skvělý nápad pro správu vícero vozů. Zatím do appky sypu data a uvidím jak bude fungovat proti opomínání věcí okolo vozového parku. 
Uvítala bych, když by stejně jako zelená karta šel přidat i malý (případně i velký) TP. Malý jsem si tam dopasovala přidáním druhé zelené karty. 
Taky by se hodila viditelná kolonka pro VIN, když jdete pro díly, tak se to hodí. 
Skvělá věc! Ještě aspoň tyhle dvě položky přidat a naprosto geniální. Díky | U iPhone 8 tlačítko pro spuštění uvidíte jen když v nastavení zmenšíte text. Jinak je tlačítko mimo displej. | Aplikace zdá se funguje velice dobře bohužel si myslím že je zbytečné aby byla ještě další aplikace techničák který najde jenom podle čísla technického průkazu všechna data určitě bych aplikace propojil abych mohl mít v jedné aplikaci všechny informace o mém vozidle tzn. zelenou kartu osvědčení o registraci vozidla dálniční, Dálniční známku, STK, a určitě by se hodil i link do systému kde evidují všechny moje kontroly na servisu což vím že už existuje tak proč bych nemohl mít tyhle informace o tom kdy jsem měl auto servisované co přesně se tam servisováno kde se to servisováno a kolik to stálo tak to je vše. Držím palce s digitalizaci je to super i v téhle té podobě děkuji | Nemám co bych vytknul této aplikaci doporučuji těm co si nechtějí hlídat a pamatovat datumy | K dokonalosti chybí málo…

1. Možnost sdílení např. mezi členy rodiny
2. Možnost zapsat si VIN ke každému vozidlu
3. Propojit RZ (SPZ) s edalnice.cz a automaticky generovat platnost dálniční známky 

Ale i takto podařená appka 👍 | Dobrý den, s aplikací jsem spokojen, díky za ni. Neplánujete prosím doplnění termínu platnosti STK s upozorněním?
Děkuji. | Aplikace je docela dobra, alespon v porovnani s aplikacemi statni spravy, ale chybi mi moznost data sdilet (napr. s manzelku, nebo detmi). Take bych uvital moznost si tam nafotit roznou technicky prukaz, pripadne tam kupovat dalnicki znamky ostatnich zemi. | Aplikace docela dobra, ale nakonec pro me nepouzitelna kvuli nemoznosti registrace klasicky pres email. Ja nechci propajet muj google/facebook/apple ucet s dalsima aplikacemi. | Pojišťovna posílá zelenou kartu v pdf s heslem, takový soubor nelze přidat. Když to půjde, bude to za pět * | Je to OK | Super! | Spokojenost s aplikaci “Zelená karta”.  Zatím vše bezchybné, posléze ověří čas.Děkuji autorům.😀

Erich | Velmi dobrá aplikace, pokud má člověk víc samohybů. K dokonalosti chybí sdílení databáze mezi více lidmi, např. členy domácnosti. | Vše je OK | Aplikace vypadá dobře, jednoduše, user-friendly.
Bez problémů jsem připojil dokumenty a informace k jednomu autu.
Bohužel, připojit zelenou kartu k druhému se již nepodařilo - soubor vyberu, chvíli se točí kolečko...a tím to skončí.
Takže pro jedno auto OK. Pro více aut, přívěsný vozík atd. nefunkční (?). | Nelze spustit | na mem IOS 15.8 se nezobrazí tlačítko pro přidání karty,
takže nic…😩 | Chybí možnost sdílení  celého vozidla se všemi informacemi s dalším řidičem. | Vše na jednom místě. | Naprosto geniální, mít vše pohromadě a přehledně v jedné aplikaci | Používal jsemjinou aplikaci která začala po dvou letech vykazovat chyby. Věřím ze tato aplikace mi vydrží déle Mám tu asi 35 vozidel a všechny podstatné informace. Jenom mne mrzí ze není možno propojit upozornění FO kalendáře 💁 | Po nahrání aplikace nejde otevřít | Nezvládá práci s daty. | Skvělá aplikace, abych nezapomněl kdy si obnovit pojištění nebo objednat na technickou 😉 | Dobře ty | Na iPhone SE2 po nainstalování je tlačítko PŘIDAT nedostupné (na displeji je ho jen kousek) - nedá se stisknout. Tím je aplikace nepoužitelná.  Na iPadu funguje bez problémů. | Je to super. | Přehledné vše při ruce. Mohu doporučit | Nejde nic pridat na iPhone SE (2020), takze zatim nepouzitelne | Jinak prakticka aplikace | Výborný | Dobrý den. chtělo by to přidat i evidenci zahraničních dálničních známek… | Výborná věc stále po ruce. | Užitečná a skvělá aplikace | Vse na jednom miste a prehledne, navic upozornuje na platnost! | Neustále vyskakuje okno s tím ze už je teplé počasí tak ať přezuji pneu. Mám tam čtyři vozy ale vyskočí cca 10 připomínek protože ke každému autu mám více údajů než jen zelenou kartu TK, DZ. A nelze to vypnout. Když na to kliknu tak se to propadne do nějaké historie zpráv, ale tam nic není. Jestli to bude vyskakovat pořad tak vypnu oznámení a tím ztrácí aplikaci význam protože mě neupozorni na končící termíny. | Ještě bych uvítal, kdyby se u aplikace daly uchovat další informace, jako jsou tankovací nebo věrnostní karty, případně další poznámky. | Super aplikace, už nemusím řešit tiskárnu | Tomu říkám ZÁPLATA na pěkně velkou díru na trhu, v české legislativě i v českých mobilních aplikacích. Mockrát vám děkuji ;-) | Aplikace dělá vše, jak má. Velmi oceňuji i synchronizaci dat, takže vše vidím na dvou telefonech. | absolutně famózní přesně ta rozšíření o STK a dálniční známku jsem potřeboval. | Zdravím,
aplikace super, jen bych uvítal možnost donahrání nové zelené karty na následující období. Dnes mi přišla nová karta, která začne platit až za 3 měsíce.. do té doby ji někde zahrabu a až na to přijde, budu ji hledat.. takhle bych si ji mohl přednahrát a pustit to z hlavy..

Dark mode support si still missing and Apple Wallet support would be handy. | I cannot login. This app is total disaster! | After my bank replaced Mastercard with Visa I'm not able to activate new card. | Does not work properly | The app works as it should, however there are some features missing. It would be great to be able to save the LoungeKey card into Apple Wallet. Also I am missing the option to tie multiple cards (from different banks, to stack the free lounge passes) to the account. Could these be considered as new features? | The team who designed this should be sent to 12h Ryanair flight as punishment | A terrible log in system requires the one to create a new account when a new version is available, only to fail the account creation due to having the applicable card already registered with an account. This is after having been happy to have the app work for a few months after the very tedious and error ridden registration process mentioned by others. | Still no support for more cards from multiple providers 😟 Also no info on remaining free visits on the card. | Nejde změnit jazyk aplikace z Ukrajinstiny na cokoliv | Mají vnitřní preference pro vyšší třídu dle letenky a ve frekventovanem období se do salónku nelze dostat, upřednostňují bez ohledu na kartu Lounge key | Klientum ceske sporitelny nejde vymenit proslou kartu v systemu a nikdo nemi poradit. | Unable to register | They can’t show you just, if is or isn’t the longe where you want to go. You have to register, but if you want to register, you can’t put your country, because it doesn’t work. :/ | Worst login experience ever. After used my credentials it act like logged in, but they've forced me to create new account on top of it, but I was not able to use my original login name. I had to write card number three times and it took about half an hour to be able to use the app again. 
BTW if you have more key lounge supported payment cards, it's not possible to have more than one car per account  🤦‍♂️ | Nobody takes over accountability, when the the admission to the lounge is not granted due to “system” issues. | Asking myself for what purpose is this app made. It’s not helpful for me as Lounge Key services at all.
Plus, permanently refusing to verify my card…always responding “Oops! Something went wrong. Please again later.”

It’s very boring 😬 | Setting this up is really painful. They ask you for the same information multiple times, throw a bunch of marketing consents at you, bother you with filling your credit card number, that you used to register, again after log in. Give me a break. | it is not possible to verify my word elite mastercard.  application keeps losing connection, requires already entered data.  card registration requires all card authentication attributes, I'm concerned about security.  this does not seem like a premium service | I cannot verify my MC World Elite either in the app or on the website. I fill all the information and after I press Verify the response is: Your card number details are required. | I can not verify my credit card so the app is totally useless. Even if I try to verify my card on websites same error occurs. Useless service. I fill all card information and app response that they are not filled? WTF? | Totally useless app, support doesn't work at all. Even your own bank can't help you with this as it is a 3rd party app. As long as you have a credit card benefit. | Unable to authorize card | Hello 
I am trying to register my new card ( as old one is expiring ) but while registering I cannot find Czech Republic in country list . Actually there are like only around 25 countries in the list while you are registering your card . Can you fix the this asap . I dropped an email as well

Thanks | The app shows me some problem and tell me to try it later everytime I’m trying to registrate… | What is this app for, if I can’t see the remaining count of my free longe visits? That’s the only feature why I would use this app, and it’s missing. | App not working on my iPhone 12 Pro. Fields for username and password are locked (tapping on them does nothing), so I cannot enter my credentials.
Links for password reset and signing up work fine. | OK | Unable to create account | Velmi dobrá aplikace k získání informarmací, kde se nachází ten správný salónek. | Aplikace není v češtině :( | The application is not working. Just after you download it, there is a written that application need update. And of course no updated is available | QR code transfer to MyWallet is not working. 
And only an automatic answer after a long time, so no help from their support at all. | Nejde přidat do Apple Wallet, ackoliv to aplikace nabízí | I am not able to get my LoungeKey to Apple Wallet - Failed to retrieve pass data from server. Will there be possibility to have two payment / credit cards from different providers? | QR code transfer to MyWallet is not working | I am still getting unknown error when submitting name and card number | Zdlouhava a nesmyslná registrace vyžadující nejen cislo karty,ale i dalsi osobní údaje.

I love this app so much ❤️❤️ | Nice interface experience 👍👍 | Super | Something is paid, but otherwise pretty neat | I love the app so much!🔥 | Can you add Czech Language 🥹 | Tenký for muc | Hello! I’ve really enjoyed this app! It’s so fun to learn with it and it’s very easy! I’ve gotten more fluent! | The app is more buggy than ever before, e.g. the timer would often reset when opening another excercise… or the words cannot be pulled to the right place when selecting one of 4 options.

Also the Cantonese translations are worse and worse, they are not spoken language but rather either “official written version” which you would never use in real world, or just simply wrong translations. Looks like google translated this… | It’s very useful program for improving my language. Thank you for support of Ukraine! | The best app for learning vocabulary. So many languages | Програма мені дуже подобається, слова вчаться легко і швидко. А ще дуже приємно, що для українців рік преміуму безкоштовний. Питання про паляницю дуже класне і було дуже приємно. Мені подобається візуал програми та матеріали. Класна програма, рекомендую. | What is this? Usually you have 5 minutes to use the app in the free version. I didn’t play in 2 days and it’s still stuck in zero minutes. If there is not even the 5 minute free part anymore I’m extremely disappointed. | Please add Czech language 🙏🏻 | I have a 100 day challange of learning tagalog and this is great ite offering me 5 mins everyday so i havebit organized | Drops is a great product. 
It would be great to have a possibility to pause just after the answer to review the word. Especially with japanese language where there are so many unknown symbols for me even if I answer the question correctly. | ^ | Build basic and intermediate vocabulary. | Hello, I really like this app. Thanks for adding Ukrainian language. ❤️ | The app is great, but there are two things that are not so great:
- Everything revolves around pictures, which are sometimes not easy to identify (especially for more complex words) - it would be great if there was an option to enable displaying of the word (text) as well as the picture
- The words are USA oriented - I’m learning Vietnamese and words like Hamburger, Bacon, Hot Dog are not all that useful, as other food is way more popular in Vietnam | Trying to gamify learning? Drops have made gaming learnified. | The Application crash when it starts after last update. Loading screen disappears after a while and I am on my desktop again. I have to reinstall it every time when I want to make my daily Drops which is very annoying. Please fix it and make the updates more carefully in the future. Thank you. | Excellent way to study vocabulary 😀 | I really like the app and the style but the was you intuduce the words seems wrong, i do remember some but some but mostly i totaly forget i think there should be like voice recording and just tipping it in, but after all 3/5 | Perfektní! | Why there is no Czech language? | It’s so fun! I love it from the moment I installed. Thanks for this app! | I am coming to Spain this month and this app help me to learn Spanish 🇪🇸 I like many ways that I can learn new vocabulary: moving cards, choosing letters and using images. The best part is absolutely friendly interface with animations. 👍 | Je to super naučí mě to spoustu slovíček ☺️ | Awesome app for words I haven’t know before :) | Quite expensive premium version, but the free one does offer quite a lot plus its graphics are nicely done so 5 stars for me | Líbí se mi jejich rozšíření a tématicky lekce!:) | I have had a good experience, and my vocabulary is improving. | Hello, 

Can you please add Czech?  I’m learning Norwegian but my boyfriend is learning czech and this app is really fun! 

Thank you 
Lucy | It is great | Good just good | You can have 5 free minute, this can improve a lot. Thanks for free verision! | Díky za naučení Švédštiny😉🇸🇪 | Very good app | So much better than duolingo! Love this app | It would be great to make a small tutorial for app, but maybe i missed it, still it’s a great tool for using | please repair switching languages, the app crashes.. | Very good app for learning new languages! | Nelze ani vyzkoušet. | No other language-learning app managed to hook me up for longer, only Drops. And I actually remember the words! | Rychle a snadno doporučuji | 👍 | so far awesome, more entertaining than other language apps out there | Perfect app to learn alphabet of another language and hundreds of basic words. It is not the ultimate language app, however it is really good at getting you learn new words and memorising them. 5 min a day with bonus seconds for regular sessions in the free version is actually just about enough especially if you use another app to study language.

- Copy only the translated text or both original and translated text.

- Bug fixes and general improvements.

Our latest update includes UX improvements and new features. Here is a quick rundown of what is new:
 
- Improved user experience: We have made a number of tweaks and adjustments to the app's interface to make it more intuitive, user-friendly, and easier to access microphone, camera, and text input controls.
 
- Different translation views: you will notice a panel of different views (split-screen, single or full-screen, history, and converse (multi-device conversation)) that is easy to access and switch between. The current view is saved as default view for the next time the app is relaunched.
 
- Split-screen view: with this feature, you can now have a 1:1 conversation with the other person viewing the translation on their side by flipping one half of the screen. You can adjust the height of original or translated text space in this view.
 
- Single or full-screen view: with this feature, you can view your original and translated text on a single screen.
 
- Turn on/off history: with this setting, you can choose to save history or turn off saving history. In the history view, you can delete all translations with a single tap.
 
- Languages: you can now swap source and target languages to let the app know which languages to translate from and to.
 
- Microphone customization: with this setting, you can keep the microphone always on which means it will identify the language as you speak. You can also turn it off which will require you to manually press the microphone whenever you speak.
 
- Auto-scroll translated text: with this setting, you can turn on/off the ability to auto-scroll translated text.
 
We hope you enjoy the update and welcome any feedback you may have.

Free version is not usable anymore as basically any function has to be paid for. Had to find an alternative. | I really loved this app but now it's useless without paying for the premium version. You can add only 3 expenses per day for free. | After the last update I’ve noticed, that I can add only few expenses per day with the free version. I’ve been using Splitwise for several years and this change is a dealbreaker. It’s a shame, I really like the app. Now i will have to look for a free alternative that is actually useable. | First it was a cool app but if you don’t  buy pro version you have many limitations. You can only add 4 expenses per day. Which is really inconvenient when you travel with friends.
I deleted the app. | You can add three expenses per day if you don’t subscribe to Premium. 
I can understand ads for free users, or something else which doesn’t hinder using the app literally what it is designed for. | Been using it for years and now the devs got really greedy. Avoid unless you're prepared to go Pro. | I used to like Splitwise, it does make managing your bills easier. With my partner I have used it for a few years now. But since the new upgrade (free accounts can add just 3 expenses per day), it’s practically unusable, when you don’t want to pay for absurdly high premium account. For this reason l’m leaving the app - I will probably make just an excell file and it’s going to be for free and working. | Just another scam app that pretends it's free and then immediately makes you pay when you download it. Plus, there in no way of buying the app, only a subscription.
Very much don't recommend downloading it. It used to be okay before, but now it's turned into an evil parasitite. | Daily limit of expenses in free version is stupid beyond comprehension I need to add something before I forget and have to wait till tomorrow? Go F yourself, uninstalling and using other app! | Po té, co si autoři aplikace zavedli pouze tři bezplatné záznamy za den a pokud chcete více, musíte platit cca 4 EUR měsíčně, je absolutně nepoužitelnou. Kdyby byla alespoň možnost rozumného jednorázového poplatku, ale tohle opravdu ne. Přecházíme s celou rodinou ke konkurenci. Sbohem. | With the new add update , it’s become real pain… gonna probably switch to different app | I’ve been using this app daily for years, and loved it - then suddenly the app switched to only 3 transactions per day, or pay for Pro. No warning in app, no email, no heads up. Disappointing. | I’ve been using Splitwise for 3 years and never thought this great app will end up like this. Man seriously? I cannot add my transaction without paying you? are you kidding me? Don’t download this application unless you want to pay greedy devs. | Opakovaně vykazuje chyby ve sčítání nákladů mezi jednotlivými lidmi. Celkem zásadní chyba. Jednomu napočítá moc, jinému některé náklady vynechá, i když je vše správně zadané a nastavené. Nedoporučuji. | I have four Expenses for two people (divided by half) 450, 129, 625 
One expense 15 payed by one for the second user. 
Result should be the that the second user owes 617 to the first one. 
Application counts 587 which is totally nonsence. | Handy app with support of multiple currencies with intuitive interfaces, no need to use payed subscription, it works well with basic plan. | Somehow the app change the language from English to spanish | Please add dark mode. Overall great app | Ironic that the iPad version of Splitwise doesn't support split-view. Otherwise great app. | Fantastic app for a daily use, for couples and even for bigger groups. Clever, fast and well developed. Thanks! | Saved us a lot of time! Thanks a lot. | We use this app at our office to split payments for food. Every time I add an expense I suffer. The app looks like 10 years old, the navigation is confusing and adding a payment and splitting it unequally takes very long time. I also have to manually add a group every time, which is most of the time the same.

Also I have three groups, but I have no idea where and how much do I owe and to who. | it's a great application, it's a pity that it doesn't have Czech language support, it would definitely be used by more people | Great idea and execution! User friendly and very intuitive. | Amazing, easy to use, easy calculations, lot of options! 10/10 | Useful for splitting and settling bills and household expenses among more people under one roof. | Really easy and intuitive application with great features. I love the web interface where I can manage all expenses on Mac in home. iPhone and iPad app is good, easy to use on the road. I am happy to use it in my home and also on the road with friends. | loveit! | Uz na zacatku jsem skoncil a mazu. Vsechny jmena a jejich emaily, ktere zadam do skupiny deleni, nekam uklada (asi na server) a naopak loaduje jine emailove kontakty a jejich jmena z nejake databaze.
Kvuli soukromi a ukladani dat NEDOPORUCUJI. | User friendly. Excellent UI. Easy to use. Probably missing a calculator feature when entering an split by member. | Please add support for Czech language❣️ and fix the bug when trying to write an app review but no keyboard appears. Thank you | Perfektní aplikace pro rozdělení útraty mezi skupinu. | New update brings the same app with more design elements, but no valuable features...

Except one!!! New update brings ads and if you want to get rid of them - you must pay...

Why should I update, if I have the same features in older version without ads? :((
#sad | Love easy using of the app, really practical one, recommended! | Must have! | Nice app only thing im missing is option to fill out bank number in your profile this would really help | Meow! Love it:) | My partner and I use it for everything. | This app has solved exactly the issue that I was having many times when traveling with friends. We always lost track of expenses and who paid for what. Now it is all easy and simple. | No possibility do delete my account with i fo as mail and password | When using Euro, I must enter only round numbers. When adding e.g. 3,50 it changes the bill into 350,- I must edit to 3,- or 4,- | Really handy app! | Absolutely top app for trips with friends. It makes payments and spliting costs super, super easy. It is very well programmed and made by somebody, who knows how to make things simple, but working. | Works as it should and has some more functions. It is easy to use and understand the bills/settlements. The only missing thing is detailed table for what each person owes. 
However, it is great. | I would be perfect if you could create groups in event. (For example in house - food, clothes and so on ...) :) | We used it with friends on a holiday trip. Better than settle after each payment you can use this free app. | Intuitive UI, nice design, easy to use. Even I dont know other similar app, I appreciate this one.. | Fulfills all of my expectations from the app; easy to use, navigate, does it's job flawlessly. 10/10 would use again. | Great app to split bills among friends | This is a very good-looking app to check your financial status between other persons that also have the app. The interface is really easy to use, simple, reliable.",3.77586,116,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/12/b4/69/12b4695e-f614-fda0-185d-88af9abc98cf/9dbf50c8-4e9f-405d-b753-d5af5cfae3dd_iPhone_SE_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d8/4f/c8/d84fc891-b10d-8436-5913-d71a189272fb/8faac682-8b4f-48b5-9032-59a514dfd4e2_iPhone_SE_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/56/92/a3/5692a320-62fb-8953-f5f0-7b7bcc071e32/6945cdb7-146a-46b2-b614-b102d27c8399_iPhone_SE_03.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/58/cb/42/58cb4214-58ac-f8b5-e1c2-a85d7bb0b1e0/d810cd6c-f770-4392-9b9d-b02aa9f914e8_iPhone_SE_04.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/32/30/d8/3230d859-38b9-3cd2-8212-8e74a74c6882/8cb3be7b-8026-4db9-9726-d4c14bc12998_iPhone_SE_05.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Cannot finish the process. For some reason it is not done in the app and it is done in the browser that doesn’t load the pages. | Frustrating. It is not possible to check in via mobile phone. Terrible experience. You expect that getting a ticket on your phone is nowadays a matter of moments. Unfortunately not with BA, who have remained in the Middle Ages. | Not s real mobile app. All check in is made on web portál ;-( | Please add confirm button. Also my country of residence is probably the same as nationality and country of passport issuance. It could fill all three. | Worst app ever | I was trying to add my booking, and it couldn’t find it. (I made the booking yesterday morning). I logged out, hoping that would help, and now I can’t even log in. 
Supposedly there was an update 6 days ago. But it took us back YEARS. *sigh* | The app won’t display/add my booking. I keep trying and keep getting the ‘Unable to add booking’ message. How am I supposed to check in? This has been going on for weeks, too. PLEASE fix the app. | It may not be the fault of this app, but the BA. I paid for an upgrade, and simply could not check in until I filled in all my personal information which I found out by going through the website there was no information telling me to do this before check-in. Please, make sure this is rectified. It’s a disgrace I spent 40 minutes doing this. | After the last update the program is not working and says:"" Application could not be run on Jailbroken device"". All other programs work without problem, always install only from the AppStore. iPhone 12 | The Apple Pay feature doesn’t work in countries in which there is no county/state. Required to complete the transaction. VISA payment didn’t work either even though approved by the bank. | This app is really very unhelpful with showing the plans, boarding passes etc why app if its always anyway takes me to website for any changes? | BA - could any see how all other airlines have 1000x better and easier app. 
Can somebody from BA IT try to make online check in with for example AIR FRANCE OR LUFTHANSA !!!!! | Its again deleted flight. A am older women and it was for me not easy to wake up at 6 in the morning - to be at 9 on airport ant the flight is canceled. What to do ? It’s a shame to provide such a bad service. It was the same last year. What is happens with “legendary British A “ ?????? | I dont want to instal an app for every airline just to be able to add the boarding pass to my Wallet on an iPhone. | completely useless app
it just takes up memory space | Not an app, just a BA web browser telling you all the time to download the app | great experience | The app is fine and dandy, but the option to purchase seats is broken. | After few months the app just suddenly stopped working. Told me to update iOS so I did and it keeps telling me I need to update despite everything is updated. | Well nothing to talk about | To get a boarding pass is a miracle. The App shows I should download the app. Maybe they should test it by themselves from the point of view of somebody who is using their app once in a very long time like years. | And wants you to download the App while you’re in the App? | Horrible app. Nothing works how it should or at least how it worked before | The ticket prices offered for booking via the app are dramatically higher (like ten times!) than those searched via Web pages. Unbelievable!!! | Terrible slow and incomprehensible. But you have no other chance, you must use it. :( | New design is confusing and boring | An embarrassing application that just tries to get more money out of people in a dignified way for a better seating place. | It’s really annoying to have to re enter pass information for each flight | Joke. Even though seats for change are available in booking, other booking done at the same time gives 0 options for change. Family split. Can’t retrieve boarding pass for 1 booking, yet the other one can with no issues o. The SAME flight. Ridiculous | The App is not working on iPhone 7. | The worst application for check-in I work with.....Allways stuck  in “Collect your boarding pass with our mobile app” and no pass through......even I have I phone or Google play. finally have to do check in at the airport........ | Die App eine Katastrophe, nehmt euch ein Beispiel an Easyjet...das muss man denen als einziges lasse... | It helping me a lot, save my time and all time is working | Aplikace mě nenechala se jednorázově přihlásit - při zadávání správného booking reference a jména vyhazuje opakovaně chybovou hlášku.

Při pokusu o plnohodnou registraci hlásí “neplatnou doménu emailu” - zadávám svoji platnou gmail adresu... | By blocking access to the old version British Airways yet again lives up to its reputation as an airline which loathes its customers. | Really great app, you have here everything what you need it and it is do easy, good job | Maybe it's me, but the app asks me for all my details with every check-in :( | From all airlines apps this one is easiest to use | Does all you need from it | Does everything needed. From booking to adding pass to wallet... | I fly every week with BA and the app makes me fill in the same info again and again. | Absolutely amazing, very convenient, fast responding and comfort application! Love it! | For people that are constantly using BA this app is a must have. | Useful application! | It has improvement significantly and it is very useful and helpful, especially for frequent travellers. | The latest release is much nicer experience. Previous version was an ugly layer on top of a web site. Now the app has a more native feel. | The latest version is finally working properly a it's got a very nice design. I fly every week and use it for check in mainly and this version doesn't give me an error when I try to change my details. Thanks for making my life easier! | Little problems getting boarding pass during check-in. Solved by going to home and pushing button.
Otherwise all forked perfectly and fast. | Celkově promakaná appka s hezkym designem. | Easy to use, easy to check in and retrieve the boarding pass.",4.47159,2517,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/34/b5/35/34b535c7-59da-55a4-f463-9b3f5857e2f6/751e2bd0-2c67-4041-a18e-74b0bd7584b1_5.5_1-flight-search.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/f8/0c/c9/f80cc93e-c73d-0f5c-eae6-dcf270a4dcc7/0327bc7f-0655-4f0c-9317-4b2aecbfb2cb_5.5_2-check-in.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/6b/b1/c0/6bb1c008-0bae-08f2-00e8-47d51871aba8/ffda6611-1023-4dd0-8d7f-b8a09c737916_5.5_3-evouchers.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/9d/86/fc/9d86fcc0-8a72-377d-04bc-4ef4dea5f18a/7d016ccf-4e42-4d4c-915d-ba8c12ecd995_5.5_4-lowest-fares.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/10/bc/d1/10bcd185-3f68-d611-b2ce-f933bb16736c/4f32578a-43e2-487d-b846-c43e7edab87d_5.5_5-bookings.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/ad/9b/95/ad9b9544-63ab-0de3-04ec-0ca7edbd2dc0/12cdc7f0-66b0-4e42-8c77-8bfdb7a0eed4_5.5_6-trip-details.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/7b/94/cc/7b94cc19-42ca-c219-bcbc-2be20bd93f54/2ef0911a-dcc2-404f-a06d-9a51715a5d3a_5.5_7-recent-searches.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/d1/24/28/d1242830-29e6-2375-fedf-7b5ef44f32a1/dcdf165b-d417-49ce-92f4-090841fcfc1a_5.5_8-boarding-pass.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""Watch4-Watch4"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

(iPhone 8 with iOS 13.3) | Every time I try to buy a ticket, I’m allways suprised with message “sorry, price for your flight just went up and now you have to pay 20€ more”. 2 minutes later you get a message: “sorry... now it’s 70€ more”. Every time!!! I have never seen such a disgusting behaviour. | Pretty good app for KLM frequent fliers, easy search, booking (incl payment) and check-in. Has QRC boarding pass and is part of Passbook, which is great. One drawback - return flight details (such as seat change) are accessible only via My Trip detail in View Details section of the outbound flight which is not easy to find and also really not logic at all. | Useful application, not supporting iPhone 5 yet

Das schafft erhebliche Hindernisse für Lokalhistoriker und Liebhaber der Antike. Vetus Maps löst dieses Problem! Jetzt alle notwendigen Alte-Karten der Landkreise und Provinzen in Ihrem Smartphone. Die Anwendung ermöglicht es Ihnen, die alte Karte auf die entsprechnede moderne Karte zu übertragen.

Anwendungsmerkmale:

- Übertragung auf eine moderne Karte (Satellit, Hybrid, Gelände)
- Änderung der Transparenz der Karte
- Kartenkatalog zum Herunterladen
- Markierungen setzen
- GPS-Tracks aufzeichnen
- Suche nach Orten

Auf den alten Karten ist eine große Anzahl verschiedener Objekte angegeben, die man als wertvolle Datenquelle für die Toponymie verwenden kann, da viele Namen verloren gegangen sind - sie sind auf keiner topographischen topografischen Karte zu finden. Selbst in unserer heutigen Zeit, viele Jahre später, kann man mit Hilfe dieser Karten recht sicher durch die Landschaft navigieren.

Alte Karten sind immer offline verfügbar, für Satellitenkarten ist eine Internetverbindung erforderlich. Die Markerinstallation erfolgt durch langes Drücken auf die Karte

Premium Abonnement:
Mit dem Jahresabonnement erhalten Sie Zugang zu allen Karten zum kostenlosen Download und können auch Karten von Drittanbietern oder Ihre eigenen Karten mit Dropbox herunterladen. Die Zahlung für den ersten Abonnementzeitraum wird Ihrem iTunes-Konto bei Bestätigung des Kaufs belastet. Der Preis ist regional unterschiedlich und beträgt nun 14,99 € pro Jahr.

Ihr Abonnement wird automatisch jedes Jahr bzw. jeden Monat zum gültigen Abonnementpreis verrechnet, und dieser Betrag wird 24 Stunden vor Ende des Jahres-/Monats-Abonnements von Ihrem Konto abgehoben. Um Ihr Abonnement zu verwalten oder die automatische Verlängerung zu beenden, gehen Sie einfach zu Ihren Kontoeinstellungen und inaktivieren Sie die automatische Erneuerung mindestens 24 Stunden vor dem Verlängerungsdatum. Nach Berechnung der Jahres-Abonnements können keine Rückzahlungen mehr erfolgen. Jeglicher unverbrauchte Anteil der Probezeit verfällt bei Kauf eines Abonnements. Für weitere Informationen, sehen Sie bitte die Benutzungsbedingungen (http://www.vetusmaps.com/termsofuse.pdf) und die Datenschutzerklärung ein (http://www.vetusmaps.com/privacypolicy.pdf).

Request a ride or delivery with just a tap and track your driver in real time. Never waste time again with another call center or parking problem.

• AFFORDABLE FARES
Choose a service class for any occasion. Ride Economy for everyday errands, treat yourself to Comfort and Comfort+ to relax in a more spacious car, or go with Business when every detail counts. Use Delivery to ship items of any size by car. Fares and available service classes vary by location, but we always show the exact price (or a fair estimate) before you request a ride.

• PAY BY CARD OR CASH
You can pay for rides automatically if you add your card in the app, but drivers also accept cash. Payment method availability may vary depending on location.

• A SMART APP THAT SAVES YOU TIME
Yandex Go uses smart algorithms built on live traffic data to connect riders with drivers who can reach them fastest. Depending on your location, the app will also suggest alternative pickup points to help lower your fare.

• RIDES WITH MULTIPLE STOPS
Request a ride with multiple destinations, like if you’re dropping your kids off at school, picking up a friend on the way, or need to run a quick errand. Yandex Go maps all your stops on one route and calculates the fare for the entire trip upfront.

• CHILD SAFETY SEATS
Choose the Kids service class to ride safely with your child in a safety or booster seat.
Currently available in the capitals of Armenia, Georgia, Estonia and Latvia, as well as 13 cities across Russia.

• DELIVERY
It's just like requesting a ride: enter your address in the app, and a courier delivers your item. Both sender and recipient meet the courier at their car.

• FOOD FROM RESTAURANTS
Order food from local cafes and restaurants. Just enter your address and we’ll show you everything that’s available nearby. Narrow down your search with filters and find your favorites or try something new. Currently available in Russia and Kazakhstan.

• AVAILABLE IN 9 COUNTRIES
Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Serbia and Moldova. Visit https://taxi.yandex.com to see rates and availability in your city.

If you’d like to share your opinion about our app, a driver or company that handled your ride, please send us feedback in the app.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/ab/bc/27/abbc27ea-f7a2-6cd0-1480-4aa1a5b5c30a/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-5-0-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Navigation""]","[""6003"",""6010""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""AM"",""AR"",""HY"",""BE"",""KM"",""EN"",""ET"",""FI"",""FR"",""KA"",""HE"",""KK"",""KY"",""LV"",""LT"",""NB"",""PT"",""RO"",""RU"",""SR"",""ZH"",""ES"",""TG"",""ZH"",""UK"",""UR"",""UZ""]","352264192","14.0","2011-10-26T06:26:38Z","2024-04-03T04:44:59Z","The new version of the app is available: everything's as convenient, but works a little faster and more consistently.

Все было очень профессионально, вежливый! | Vsjo otlichno! Rekomenduju!!!! | Ребята, что за говно постоянно с оплатой. Почему у меня никогда не получается нормально сделать заказа? Летом (июнь 2021) пытался заказать в лавке еду и не мог привязать карту для оплаты и оплатить ApplePay. Пришлось писать в тех поддержку, умолять Всевышнего и поклоняться Сатане, лишь бы хоть как-то заказать бедному программисту (себе любимому) покушать, чтоб не выходить из дома. Но как говорится, буй с ним, привязал - заказал - успокоился. Спустя пол года. У моего друга возникает день рождение (такое бывает). Я, находясь в другой стране, хотел его порадовать сочными бургерами из Макдональдса. К сожалению, на привязанных карточках денег не оказалось. Думаю, ну, ребята из Яндекса же не пальцем деланные. Все-таки крупный IT гигант не только на российском рынке, но и на международной арене. Явно уже всё починили, там же программистов всяких как дерьма в болоте, что-нибудь-то они умеют. Но, спойлер-спойлер, не умеют. Новую карту привязать не удалось. ApplePay использовать тоже не удалось. Пришлось, как в Древней Руси, переводить деньги с одной карты на другую, которая привязана, и потом платить. Может ещё пушнину Вам в офис привезти, только потом курьера начнёте искать для моих чизбуреров?! Естественно, пока я все это делал, подорожала доставка Яндекс еды. На 100₽. Не много, но сам факт - это неприятно. Что из-за недо программистов, приходится терять время и я же за эти ошибки потом ещё плачу. Вывод: так себе, Вы IT гигант. Вы как Джимми Браво - прическа и мускулы большие, а по факту - говно на палке. | Приложение ошибается в геолокации - в результате списывают дополнительную сумму за «ожидание водителя». Если отказываешься сразу от предложения - все равно списывают деньги за «ожидание», даже если уже уехали на другом авто от того же «Яндекс такси». Очень неприятно. | Yandex doesn’t seem to care much about public health in Russia as 90% of drivers don't wear masks. | Полный ноль | It works exactly as I would expect it shall :-). I just problem using iPal, but the same credit card used directly works perfectly.

We forgot camera on taxi, so we tried contact driver via app. This feature not working. They advertise that you can contact any driver from previous trips for 7 days but I cannot contact anyone. I tried to contact another driver without any success. So be careful. Don't loose anything in taxi and you will be happy. | We used it 2x in Naples, Italy. First from the center to Herculaneum, price in app showed 25€, the taxi meter was showing 32€ and when we left the card I was charged 60€!!!!! Ridiculous, app support was reached and never got back. Second time we used it from the center to the airport and were paying really close attention to app price and taxi meter, in the app it showed 15€, taxi meter was showing 20€ and almost 30€ was deducted from my card. HORRIBLE! | Zadal jsem rezervaci predem. Narozdil od Uberu mi dal normalni taxi za rozumnou cenu. Takze v Miláně ta sluzba je top. | The app worked normally, I started the car rental drive. When I wanted to end the ride, the application does not respond and the rental time continues to run. It's been three hours and the app is just running in the background, no activity, and the app still won't launch. I can't lock, unlock, start the car, but they keep charging money. | I ordered taxi, waited for 20 min but no one is picked my order, so I cancelled but money is gone from my bank account forever. No even any info about this trip in my profile. | I ordered a booking taxi for the next day at 4 morning because of the flight. at 3:59 they wrote to me that they didn't have a driver. they refunded the money immediately, that's great, but it made it difficult for me to get to the airport. | I do not normally write reviews, but what happened to me, I had to, I ordered a taxi in Dublin at the airport through this app to the center of Dublin. the estimated price was €25-36, it cost me €36. The driver arrived and was immediately unpleasant and superficial. when he dropped us off in the center of Dublin on the taximeter, the price was €35, I got off and the gentleman drove off. suddenly the amount from 36€ was adjusted from the bank to 56€ + 20€ some fee or something, so I paid 40€ more for the taxi. I don't know if he did it because we were tourists from another country, but this has never happened to me with UBER or BOLT.

I am currently dealing with my money and hope they will refund it to me. But never again with this company once and that's enough. | Aplikace ukazovala cenu cca 32eur po objednání taxi. Nakonec byla stržena částka 55,90 eur! Nikde na to neupozorní. Už nikdy více. | Využito 2x. Poprvé jsem v aplikaci odsouhlasila cenu 20e, na účtu rezervováno 18e, následně strženo 22,5e. Podruhé odsouhlaseno 21e, na účtu rezervováno 18,5e a následně strženo 32e? Tohle je opravdu neprofesionální jednání. Navíc nechápu, jak může mít zde aplikace 4,5 hvězdy a na googl sotva 3,9 a samé negativní recenze.. | Cant even log in cos i cant change national prefix of phone number to verify my acc… | Not working country code in seting phone number | The app charges you cancellation fee even if the driver doesn’t arrive. So basically by booking a trip you already pay to them no matter you received the sevice or not. What the hell! | Be careful. It shows u 10 e price and then u will pay 25. | The app doesn’t show the price in Italy and permits the driver to put any value they want. The price is not metered what so ever! | I lost 45 minutes of trying and €10. I will never use any app Italy. | Dont use this and stick to Uber. They steal your money…ordered a taxi in Rome, they cancelled it but kept money. | Price is not real!! Scamming | Made an order in Naples two days before our ride to airport, taxi didn’t arrive. We almost didn’t catch our flight. Thank your very much 😉 | Paid twice more than it said | Ordered a taxi one day before the trip to the  airport (at 5 am), but no one arrived! There was no option to contact the driver. No way to contact support via app! | Never download this app. It’s a big scam. Prices dont corespond with What app says And drivers will charge you two times the price or more. Trust me, dont download it! | I have been charged(robbed) by 10€/km in Naples Italy, once repoted customer support told me, they are only intermediary and is not respinsible for the drivers rates. Never gonna use this again. | No cars!!! Why google recommend this stupid app? Very bad. I lose my time because of you. Disgusting. | In Napoli 31€ for 3km. App charged me 15€ and driver another 16€ | The price is higher than what is in the app ! The app was showing 15-19 Euros and the driver charged us 28.50 € ! The driver was Alessandro L., Fiat Freemont (EM617SD) It was in Rome, Italy. I don’t recommend this. 

Edit: We have submitted a query, but no response from Free Now! | Be careful, they are thieves. | Unbelievable!!!
In case you choose this app you will be definitely robbed. The app shows much less then the drivers ask you to pay...and they justify that they have to pay some fee etc. The price definitely does not correspond with the price in the app. It is much higher (in my case increased from 18€ to 30€). 
Definitely not recommended!!! | Application showed us around 18€ and we had to pay 30€ from Fuimicino beach to the airport! Drivers under this app are thieves! Our driver told us that the price is higher because of it was Sunday and he has to pay some fee. Liar! | We ordered a taxi from Dublin airport and we were told by app to pay between 28 and 38€ - at the end we paid 50€. You would not experience something like that with Uber... Dissapointed. | Estimated price 30 eur, onboarding 5 Eur, entering Airport 10 Eur. In total 44 Euros. Normal taxi is cheaper without aditional fees. | The price estimation was €12-€14, but the driver charged us €38!
 I see in the app that I paid €20, but that’s not true. I want my money back! | App does not crash, location-wise works just fine, but you need to work on the trip settings GUI.

The way user is walked through ordering taxi and setting the route is pretty weird.

Let it me like a program installation wizard, step by step and clear pls. | Very modern map-based UI | However, when connection is lost, it's useless...cannot even call the driver",4.55016,638,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/b3/74/be/b374bed3-efd1-e281-4520-717e68f883d9/51dd9f36-cf2a-4c18-befe-fdedbb7db0f4_iPhone8_UK_IE_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/7e/fe/2d/7efe2dbe-d948-40fc-82fc-5cb22779e100/f00ce4d3-5d4f-481b-8e68-05843fbee6a6_iPhone8_UK_IE_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/9d/40/4a/9d404a77-a6a7-bc2f-9fd2-d86564306572/63bd2011-7466-4384-9b34-53c79a1407d3_iPhone8_UK_IE_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/5b/e8/e5/5be8e544-adec-f034-d020-2e821366064d/b1e08082-a4fe-4dc3-8dc3-e48b0c4b011b_iPhone8_UK_IE_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource112/v4/14/62/48/14624841-f95b-d62d-d958-345a500ac093/58fb5d58-6bf9-49bf-b779-f9cca96cb5d1_iPhone8_UK_IE_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/3b/46/82/3b468217-c365-9155-1ade-552c13369ab1/c1d3b65d-11d9-47b5-a55e-94d9193647cd_iPhone8_UK_IE_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource211/v4/df/43/f4/df43f4ab-85b6-acbd-02c7-28a946937943/3c81bf5e-38e4-405b-8f48-10f7f02458c8_iPhone8_UK_IE_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/be/66/34/be663474-bf01-3f07-90ca-a400d9249046/0bc2bd3f-0727-4d86-958a-516e2cf7164a_iPhone8_UK_IE_8.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource122/v4/95/ac/bb/95acbb17-883d-e55c-5576-4d024fb3743c/42f341bf-f0b3-45bf-b394-2f9c0f318a0e_iPhone8_UK_IE_9.png/392x696bb.png""]","[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/ac/0e/19/ac0e195d-53b2-562d-f8df-bea3dd3d33c0/285bae41-93ae-4d7f-9fc6-58b6be4f656c_1_Radar@3x.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/99/68/6c/99686c38-bf94-33d2-1502-022c3d13fa13/f72b7c7f-fbb8-4b36-a32f-e981983ed67c_2_ServiceTypeSelection-Taxi@3x.png/576x768bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/13/f8/cc/13f8cccd-131f-f8d7-f349-e2fd302735e4/c9e71716-59ab-46e0-b6fa-bef75ebfac75_5_Pickup-Time@3x.png/576x768bb.png""]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iP

- flights from PRG show wrong terminal and usually no gate, 
- some of my previous flights cannot be added because they are apparently missing in your database - this is really frustrating and you should add an option to add those flights manually. 

Please fix these issues, I love your app! | Looks nice , but even entering historical data you need to pay, nah 🫸🏻❌🤦🏻‍♀️ | I love this app, I originally downloaded it to test it but now that I've added my historical flights and future flights I absolutely adore this app, the app itself is well optimized and generally works well. I recommend to everyone who flies a lot ✈️😁 | The amount they are charging for lifetime license is nothing but robbery. The app itself does not do much anyway, though seeing your flight info on Dynamic Island is an amazing thing. It’s a great idea, hidden behind a huge paywall. | Amazing and intuitive | I liked the app for the first flight with live tracking feature. But when I subscribed to the pro version for y next flight. I didn’t have live tracking nor Apple Watch tracking.
Disappointed. | Even as we were sitting in the plane, the app still didn’t show our gate. After arrival, it didn’t show our luggage belt. Dissapointing. | For the app that is supposed to make flying less stressful it’s too unreliable. 
 1. Live Updates still showing 2 hours until gate departure, meanwhile the same screen shows departure time which is in 5 minutes. On the same screen. 
2. Previous flight has been showing as as departing hours after I landed 
3. One of the flights I had got delayed for hours, app was showing everything running on time 
4. For some flights app had never shown gate assigned 
5. Notification 2 hours before the flight shows temperature in Fahrenheit’s despite my settings (Celsius).

Note: I’m take a lot of flights from Prague, which isn’t a small unknown airport. 
UI and feature set is nice though 👍 | Is this working only in the US? Very unreliable in Europe.

Was very impressed by its service during transfer in Vienna | This stu*id app really does not support passes to Apple Wallet???🤔 | In last 2 years I used 4 different apps from different companies and this one is the best one. Everything works on first try and you can see all important information.
Nice job | I booked shortly a flight and go in the night, in the business you dont know in advance when you have to fly but with this airline is impossible just to check in!!! Installed the app, registered and the app requiered to verify the email adrese by link which they sent to my email. After email verification not possible to log in to the app! It say that there already exist another account with my email.. people, my time is expensive, I have no time for such looser company. If you need an contact to a good IT specialist let me know but dont waste my time and do not stress me, because just few hours before the flight. | App says data download failed even after reinstall. Chat support is useless. | when working, it’s a fine app for flight management, but unfortunately most of the time the app is not working - constantly asking for internet connection (although I am fully connected) and indeed when the app thinks i’m offline there is absolutely nothing I can do | Good app overall, but this airline moved my flight time 3 times, very disappointed. Long wait times when calling to the call centre, over 15 minutes. | I fly about once a month, eveey single timw I need to uograde the app!!!
I cannot paste the reference when searchin My Booking / Check-In and neother the app remembers the last search for more than few days... | Austrian would do a service to the public if they actually removed the app from the store. Apart from technical glitches, its impossible to log in (because I already have a web account (sic!), check in, or basically do anything.
Considering I’m actually paying this company to get me somewhere, the fact that I cannot checking via app is a ridiculous rip off. | The most horribe airline app and web - I can not check in as it can not match booking code, when you checkin via web, ir asks for eticket number and all flight details (why??), then it sent link for mobile boarding pass, which is not available...What a services?!?!

With HoppyGo car sharing, you can easily rent from more than 1 500 cars directly from the owners. Find the perfect vehicle for any occasion with over 300 car types in more than 240 cities across the Czech Republic. Get the key from your first rental within 24 hours since the sign up. 

At the same time, if your own car is parked in the lot far too often, you can join hundreds of car owners and start earning money by renting it to the others. HoppyGo will be your middleman. 

Is car the only missing piece in your plans?

Signing up, filling in your profile and uploading necessary documents takes only a couple of minutes of your time. The approval process then takes less than 24 hours.

Pick whichever car fits your need, choose the time of your rental and select your pickup location. All you have to do now is to wait for the approval from the owner.

3)	Pick up your car or have it delivered to your doorstep
Communicate with the car owner via the HoppyGo app. Then meet the owner, go through the handover procedure and hit the road. You don’t have to worry, all rentals are insured to cover both drivers and owners.

Stay away!! | Zdravim. Nacita se vam to hrozne pomalu. Az me to odrazuje v te appce neco delat. A to jsem na wifi i na datech a mam kvalitni pripojeni. Napr filtrace aut v Praze na zitrek. Dle znacky trva mesic a kdyz nedejboze chci seradit dle ceny, tak je to stale bile a cekam a cekam. | This app is disturbing. Nothing works correctly. Please fire the team who made this app. | Použij při registraci promokod Wolfman_CZ | Fajn myšlenka, jen se mi nelíbí způsob vyhledávání. Bylo by fajn mít možnost zadat pouze obec a rádius, v kterém se mi má ukázat nabídka vozidel. | I highly recommend this app, from both lender a borrower perspective. | Aplikace NEUSTÁLE spamuje otravnými reklamamy i když je to v nastavení zakázané. | Aplikaci využívám už dlouho ale pořád to má jeden velký nedostatek. Jakmile si na telefonu člověk začne filtrovat auta, tak se nenačtou. Ukáží se prázdné “bubliny” a nelze s tím nic dělat. Je to problém na všech telefonech i u ostatních uživatelů. Je mi to celkem líto. Znemožňuje to vyhledat přesný vůz. | Zobrazení chyby při historii jízd a zápůjček vozidel. Jinak skvělá aplikace👍 | U aut se opakovaně zobrazují různé ceny. Před dokončením registrace se vám zobrazují více než poloviční ceny! Chápu to jako podvod…lákadlo a mámení osobních info z lidí. Dva telefony, 2 aplikace, 2 různě dokončené profily a 2 různé ceny. Neseriózní! | Idea is very nice, I use hoppygo time to time, but app makes me crazy. I want to enter address and date and it doesn’t let me to set it for long time, after I am able to write something there it shows me cars far away. | Například mi teď nereaguje tlačítko potvrzení rezervace, což je docela zásadní nedostatek. | Ze začátku jsem si to založil jen tak, že to zkusím a už bych auto jinde nepůjčoval.

- rychlý
- jednoduchý
- peníze vždy do par dni. | Cena za výpůjčku Škoda Enyaq. V nabídce cena včetně nabíjení v průběhu výpůjčky. Následně strženo 1400 Kč za nabíjení v průběhu cesty 220 km. Vůz připraven s 80 % baterií a vrácen se 100 %.
Velmi nesolidní jednání. Rozhodně tuto službu nedoporučuji. | Nefungují filtry po aktualizaci, zkontrolujte to! | Rozhodně a jednoznačně ne!!!
Tato platforma vám zdevastuje majetek. Využije ho spolu a vaším časem pro vlastní obohacení. 
Z 25 zápůjček byly jen 3 bezproblémové. Poškozování vozidel, bourání, kouření, nedotankované, zničené brzdy, interiér. Drogový dealer na falešné doklady co nevrátil auto. Téměř totální škoda dodávky, zničená převodovka Peugeota a mnoho, mnoho, mnoho dalšího. Přečtěte si články na PrahaIN.

V žádném případě sem nedávejte svoje auto. Tito ""marťani"" nejsou schopní ničeho jiného, než opakování prázdných frází, lží, ignorace.
Až potom co skutečně hrozíte soudem a medializací, což stejně proběhne, začnou náznaky řešení, které ovšem nikam nevedou.
Komunikace s podporou se podobá otřesu mozku. 

Určitě se snaží na 100%, ovšem těch jejich sto je jako běžných 5%. Výsledek 0.

Vadí vám vaše auto? Zaregistrujte ho sem. | The app is much slower than it used to be and the usability also went down by a great deal. | The app is slow. And after a while of using the content is not displaying correctly. There are just blank placeholders and it has to be restarted.

Aplikace je pomalá. Po chvíli používání se obsah nezobrazuje - pouze prázdné karty a aplikace se musí restartovat. | Bez zadání karty je appka v podstatě k ničemu… | Skvela sluzba, ale mnoho bugu v aplikaci :( | Doporučuji, vstřícné jak půjčujícím tak řidičům. Zvací kód - pavelbuzek. Pokud byste někdo chtěl 500,- do začátku | Quick&easy car renting! Everything is super smooth with perfect application in your smartphone. Use every month. Lot of amazing vehicles available. | It has been some time since I’ve used hoppygo for first time. Their service is outstanding and I also appreciate good quality of cars. I can recommend this company. Their customer care is also excellent! | Mastodont ve skvělém stavu, výborné auto, komunikace s majitelem perfektní, vyřízení rychlé, Diky | Jsem rád, že služba hoppygo funguje. Sice je t´dozdlouhavější registrace, což je pochopitelné, ale pak už jde vše rychle. Z mého pohledu škoda, že není možné nabídnout motorku. Užitečné jsou filtry, je možné vyhledat auto dle ceny, typu karoserie či vybavení. Za mě dobrá alternativa ke klasickým půjčovnám a zajímavá možnost přivýdělku pro majitele aut. | Everything is working perfectly but one day of rental is simply not 24 hours as at normal rental places. If you take it on Wednesday 14:00PM and return it Thursday 11AM you will pay for 2 days despite the fact you used the car for less than 24 hours. | Chtěl jsem půjčit na svatbu kabriolet a obrátil jsem se na servis HoppyGo. To byla chyba. Našel jsem tam auto, “krásný” Chrysler Le Baron. Na fotkách naprosto krasavec, bílý, lesklý, úplně v perfektním stavu. Zaplatil jsem pronájem a v klidu čekal na den vyzvednutí, představoval jak krásné budeme v tom vypadat - máme skoro klasické auto, v hezkým stavu. Realita mě docela překvapila. Na autě chyběly kousky laku, obrovské žluté skvrny. Byl jsem v šoku a prosto nevěděl co dělat. Po krátkém hovoru z majitelem bylo řešeno rezervaci zrušit a bylo mě řečeno že peníze pošlou na účet za 3 dny, a celou částku za pronájem. Za šest dnů, žádné peníze ne přišly, a po telefonickém hovoru zjistilo se že bude vráceno pouze 50% z částky, protože “auto je technicky v dobrém stavu, a musíte počítat ze je starší”. Ve kterém technickém stavu to je - nevím, ale kosmetický stav je opravdu ošklivý, a nebylo uvedeno v inzerátu, a nebyly tam fotky těch defektů. Do konce už prošlo 8 dnů, a žádné peníze na účet se nevrátily, manažery aplikace neustále chrání majitele vozu, i s tím že žádná prohlídka předem nedostupná. Z tohoto vyplývají že zákazníky vůbec nejsou chráněné před podvodem ze strany majitelů vozu a nedostupné bezpečné používání servisu pro zákazníky. Servis nedoporučuji, nemáte žádné práva jako zákazník. | It’s a great app, easy for all parties, all nice, needs few improvements in the filters, but otherwise love it! | Doesn't open at the start!!! | Bezvadné auto. Ma svižný motor a je v perfektním stavu. | Different prices before and after registration… I’m not actually sure if that it is legal | Guys be careful of this service they used my bank card information without my authorization for withdrawing money above the agreed rental fees, and when I get back to them they mentioned that it is for cleaning and when I explained to them that this is a fraud from the car owner because he got the car in good status they didn’t listen to me so please be careful about your bank account information. | Miluju tuhle aplikaci:D vydelava mi, diky ni se nemusim zbavovat auta a jeste mi vydela na pojistku:D jsem prekvapena ze se vubec nekdo ozyva kdyz nebydlim v krajskem meste :D | Easy and best in Czech Republic. I love Volvo XC60 from Prague 5, Revnicka. 🤍 | Top | fantastic practical fast and perfect offer Recommend | Very good experience, even late arrival wasn't any issue | Už více jak půl roku mi nefunguje aplikace iP12. A nejedná se o individuální problém. Problém se už tu v komentářích objevil několikrát. Hold dobrá myšlenka, ale nedostatečný development. | Super domluva, bez problemu, auto krásné a ciste | A great selection of vehicles at great prices! | Široký výběr a nízké ceny - ideální služba pro ty, kteří si chtějí levně půjčit auto a ještě podpořit soukromé majitele. | This service is simply great, of course together with the app! | Děkuji a doporučuji | The app is nice and all, it works pretty well. But up to 7 working days to return the deposit? That must be a joke | Půjčení 24 hodin je pro aplikaci 2 dny | Moci využít již vyrobená a někým pořízená auta, čerpat z nich užitek, majiteli tak pomoct splácet cenu auta, které by jinak stálo na dvorku, a ještě mít k dispozici flexibilitu, které konkuruje jen volný carsharing, a neuvěřitelně široký výběr, to si troufnu označit za revoluční projekt. Aspoň v našich končinách.

Za mnohých okolností vás nicméně volný carsharing vyjde paradoxně levněji, protože zde není v ceně palivo, jak bývá zvykem. Pokud ale toužíte po jiném autě, nebo chcete být v osobním kontaktu s majitelem, kterého navíc všichni mohou otevřeně revenzovat (stejně jako majitelé řidiče), pak je toto perfektní rozšíření portfolia sdílené mobility.

Ocenil bych v aplikaci filtraci také podle technických specifikací vozidla (např. výkonu, rozměrů…) a přidání dalších údajů (provozní hmotnost, ne jen maximální, již zmíněné rozměry, točivý moment, možnost pro majitele vypsat spotřebu pro různé situace). Společně s ne vždy konkurenceschopnou cenovkou (holt mají hlavní slovo majitelé a je to dobře) tedy velmi symbolicky bez poslední hvězdy. | They have a great costumer service. As I needed fast approval of my profile and had an issue due to the quality of my uploaded documents, I reached out to them and a nice employee names Tereza handled my case fast, easy and with a very friendly attitude! | Aplikace mi na iP12 již půl roku nejede ... | I love the app and the idea. I am renting my car through the platform and could not be more happy. They have awesome customer service that replies within minutes and also picks up phone immediatelly (even on weekends). The only thing I am missing is loading prices for each days. I hope it will change and I will be able to create more dynamic pricing policy. | Use my code RC3Bi1oK",4.58012,1067,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f1/70/f2/f170f2bf-626d-bf10-8ec0-9cd239884208/00d9fb0e-85d5-46b9-a087-6e9ceb3f1261_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/c6/d7/93/c6d793fe-c4c2-b6f3-a19d-e30a8edab1b4/1d78245b-70bd-4f43-a77e-06002925c965_2.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c0/b9/2c/c0b92c55-ca80-6e62-343d-23334ac775cb/d99696a3-1257-4c39-9ac7-f5df4ffd4219_3.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a6/4f/29/a64f296e-9b5a-fdf1-9a4d-b1896c579ea5/2fe341b7-2545-451d-b910-e99d749a1cca_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/23/f0/25/23f02500-db1e-bf03-95b1-1975db7c8e5b/057456c7-cf41-49e6-af24-37fedd4d7429_5.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/21/d9/dc/21d9dcd9-d9de-0a0b-0fe7-6509ac98b99c/1507f004-225f-4d73-a366-db6a486d85de_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/f3/e6/6a/f3e66af3-c21b-8ec2-54e2-ab1c94b54c3a/cc093cdf-f95f-4ed0-9643-15affcf3370a_7.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Nearly unable to make a simple check in… | I just tried to change my seats for the flight tomorrow and it didn’t work at all. Disappointing, not sure what is wrong with the app. | The problem freezes. Hello, I have a problem with the application on the iPhone 12 mini. When I move to bonus l bookings where I have a saved trip, everything freezes at that moment and I can't get anywhere. I have to turn the app off and on again. even reinstalling doesn't improve anything. Thank you for your help. | This application isn’t usefull. After checking you just get message, that you should ask for your Boarding pas on the counter on Airport. Wellcome in 2024 electronic exchange of documents! Just waiste of time with stupid application which doesn’t provide basical service. Another waiste of time is to go early on Airport and wait on counter. The AF service is worst in this than all cheap airlines. | l'application se bloque, s'exécute lentement et comporte de nombreuses erreurs.  les cartes d'embarquement ne peuvent souvent pas être affichées. | The button to add a boarding pass to the wallet is not available anymore after the recent update | even though I completed the booking and payment for the upgraded seat more than two months ago, it is not possible to complete the check in the day before departure. I paid 12,000 miles / €80 for the seat of my choice and the app shows me that I'll probably be sitting somewhere else. This is the second time this has happened to me in a row. 

The app also doesn't allow me to preview the seating chart on the plane the day before departure. However, the seat number that I have in my confirmation email after payment does not match the number that the app shows me the day before departure. So I can do absolutely nothing but wait to be surprised again before boarding the plane. | Restez comme vous êtes, accueillants, communicatifs, humains ...le contraire des robots ou des personnels qui récitent leur leçon. Vive Air France, son naturel, sa bonne humeur. A bientôt | I am very sad that you  have changed  the condition of flying blue…. | Déconnexion automatique constante, dysfonctionnement absolu lors d'une nouvelle tentative de connexion.  Un vrai idiot a dû inventer ça !  Je ne comprends pas que la gestion d'une telle entreprise n'a pas d'importance du tout.  Une application complète et inutile.  C'est une honte pour la France ! | I never wrote any review on any app, but this one is not working, automatically login in french, can’t find english… I only downloaded it because airfrance webstite don’t want to log me in on my phone (works only on computer or notebook)! So app doesn’t work, website also on phone.. idk if it’s just on iphone, but it doesn’t matter, still very very bad.. :( if there would be “0 star” option, I would use is over “1 star” | It doesn't work at all | still broken login…. Nothing better… | HELLO DEVELOPERS!  LOGIN PROBLEM!  Please wake up!  Have you noticed reviews published in the last 6 months?  If so, the login issue would have been resolved a long time ago.  So far, this seems to be a problem for Czech users.  Any advice or recommendation is welcome. | You can download this app and check in, so you can get a check in confirmation and get your boarding pass after standing in a queue for one hour :-) | I have opted out of “commercial notifications” but the app spams me anyway. | Hello, about a hundred times I have tried to log in via the app on the iPhone. I have never succeeded. The red login button just doesn't work. | Not possible to login from iOS 15.4. | Login and wallet on iPhone doesn’t work | Click on login does not work! Can you please do something about it? | I am unable to click on log in button anymore… | It’s even worse than airfrance website, which is so bad already. Can’t find ANYTHING useful in the app, can’t download boarding passes, can’t check in, can’t find where the lounge is, etc. It’s a nightmare. | affreuse appli. pleine de publicités et d’autres informations inutiles, mais pour check-in pratiquement inutilisable alors que c’est la seule chose dont la plupart de voyageurs a vraiment besoin | This app is worst I have seen. Impossible edit or delete of passport, any change or update of personal informations doesn’t work! | Did not even find out how to switch to english.. Rubish app, developers wake up. It should be in english default!!! | Could have just sent via email | Really terrible experience, online check in is throwing errors when you want to download boarding pass. Would strongly recommend flying with another airline. | That’s the only thing the app can do: crash! Nothing more. Want to change your details? No! It crashes! Want to BUY a seat reservation? No! It crashes! Nothing works properly! | Doesnt work, I cant look up the connections... | I can’t find how to switch to English 🥴 | This is like the worst airline app ever, super slow, cluttered and when it comes to checking-in I never got a boarding pass directly and had to go to the counter. Simply “awesome”...you guys should look to the KLM app, it’s quite sad, that one airline holding can make a really good app that works perfectly for one part of the company, but for the other part it makes the absolutely piece of junk, that work like...well France. 
And please, developers, get rid of that French chauvinistic attitude, I really don’t need the app in French when I first install it, when my phone is completely in English!!!! Everyone can do that and you’re really not anything special to not do this... | App in french? Really? Are you serious? | App itself looks nice in first impression. But its very crapy. When you instal it, its in french by default. There is no visible button to change language, you need to find this posibility in menu which is in french of course. When you find it, all countries are in french. So you need to find somehow your country. Did you ever saw any french who changed language to for example czech? When you trying to create an account and you fil everything correctly a trying to save, you will get an error. But from error message you dont know whats wrong. So after few testings was only one solution. Erase app a never try it again. Very very french approach... | In love with it !!!! | This app is disaster. Lots of things stop working for no apparent reason. The only reason I use it is to get boarding pass into the Wallet. Search doesn't work most of the time, same problem with ticket purchase.

Out of all the companies, that have scooters there, Trier's were by far in the best condition. They ride well and were easy to use. The only hiccup came when returning them one time. The app didn't recognize the officially marked spot for scooter parking, but there was another spot nearby so no problem. | Duper | Very satisfied 👍 | Is a little bit expensive ride, bit of you are abroad nad need to be quickly on other site of town is amazing. All goes perfect 👍 | Not recommend. Expensive ride and after 5minute, I must push manually, because scooter has discharge and I cant end ride out of parking area and time flies and value for ride too. | Greeeaat ride! | First ride, everything was working as expected. Thanks | I’m in Kolln and 8/8 scooters so far are operarional, it’s 10pm | Always good condition keep it up. Firm and sturdy! Good App as well | Very good but it was too slow for racing a car | Super great for a sightseeing Trip ;) | Boží jízda! | We decided to go with scooters from beach to the football stadium in Malaga. After 30 minutes ride we came to the stadium and then came the thing. We wanted to park the scooter close the stadium, but the park places were 3km far from us! The parking spots in Malaga are only close to the beaches and 3/4 from map in the app is without parking place! Terrible, so we had to go back to the beach, spend 7eur for the ride back and had to walk to the stadium, but also lost a time and we were late on the football match. So we unninstal the app and never again. | We wanted use ride in Malaga, so we finded free scooters… after 4km we came to the Malaga football stadium we find out that parkings spots are only near the sea.. so we must ride back 2km…. We could walk it from the start… totaly uselles | Easy to use app and great scooters. Thank You! | Guys great fun but please it would increase your reve when u implement the possibility take 2 tiers by one person. | Úplně na nic, nešlo mi to ukončit ani na volném místě a aplikace mě tak nutila jet na další parking spot. Nakonec jsem musela jet na výchozí bod. Aplikace neumožní koloběžku vrátit ani na místě, kde už dvě parkují..v parku, kde je místa dost? Hrozný, nepoužívat. | App doesnt work and crashes on iphone se2020 | Perfekt ride | Super věc pro trajdani po Krakově | For the first time to use TIER - I can only recommend it😉👍 | Aplikace funguje výborně. Koloběžky Tier jsou podle mě celkově nejlepší koloběžky. | Ride | Totally not worth it. Use different company’s. Limes works much better.

Everything working correctly? SO DON ´T TOUCH THIS | There is simply NO WAY for 4,7 rating for this app. I know too many people (dozens) who just HATE all the Concur stupid idea of making employees being accountants, but do not know  any single one who like it. Including top management. Maybe (MAYBE) if we would be forced to do only reporting, but we must also plan and purchase all our tickets, hotels, car retals through this and it is simply bad. And then? My travel expenses were done by me on the 1st day after return and the proceed and paid within next day. Now? As I as techniciam must wait for all the payments will be proceeded, take care of all the numbers, then fight with the fact the scanned bills does not appear in pc version of Concur... just give me a break. There is boiling oil bath waiting for whoever got this idea first in the hell!! | very handy app thank you. It’s much more comfy to put business travel stuff here than in the desktop hell in my office. | A | Excellent I am using this I am using I am using it | After latest ios update it does not work. | This is the most hassle free claims submission I have ever had. I don't need to keep the paper copies of the bills anymore, no scanning, emailing, uploading to system. I didn't even need to enter bill details, just click a picture and the app does all that for you. I am very impressed with the UI and the ease of usage. | Easy to use, smart, quick, helpful.!! | I really like this app and use the app rather then web. | Very usefull - I can do my ERs on the go. Also approvals for my subordinates are processed much faster with the app - its actually better than the desktop. I am missing the travel request approvals - but it might be specific to my company. | It is helpfull | It will be good to have option for adding multiple pictures to recipe only bug so far | Great | I like to use it for my monthly expenses. It's reliable a fast to use. | I find thos app very user friendly and usefull. | Velmi uzitecny pracovni nastroj | Podle mě něco co vám usnadní práci. | Very useful, can be only recommended. | Nice app. It shows the list of existing trips.

The ESTA app currently has two features available: Apply for New Individual Application and Search for Existing Application.
•	The “GET STARTED” feature allows travelers to create a new ESTA application, pay for the ESTA and submit the application to be processed by the system to determine if they are eligible to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program without a visa. The system will provide the traveler with an automated response.

We booked a trip to the airport for our morning flight. The pickup time was set to 3am and I charged Careem credits explicitly so I didn't have to use cash and deal with scammer taxi drivers. Our driver called me at 2:55 claiming that he needs a payment in cash and that it'll be 100Dhs instead of 50-73 which was the range the app listed. What I didn't realize at the time was that the app was already charging us the Careem credit so the driver was trying to scam us into double paying.

We needed to catch our flight so I agreed but said I needed to withdraw from ATM at the airport. The driver proceeded to drive us AWAY from the airport looking for ATMs because I refused to pay a large withdrawal fee at the one where he stopped for us. 

When I found out he wasn't going to the airport I threatened to call support and police at which point he finally turned around. At the airport I found out he was trying to double charge us the entire time.

I contacted Careem support with this case and they did not react.

Stay away from this app. Let your hotel arrange a driver with pre set price instead. | Driver marked as Arrived, however not to where he was meant to pick me up. Kept chatting with him for 10min asking him where he is, even sending him pic showing him where he’s meant to be, he just cancelled the ride without my knowledge or agreement, making my account outstanding and unable to book another ride! Support not responding even 6 hours and 4 messages later - no one answered or dealt with the issue, I am still unable to book a ride and go where l was going. Just awful experience - with the drive and non existent customer service | Book your taxi via different providers, Careem is the worst service ever | I can not find a button for cancelling a plus subscription. | I ordered a taxi that didn’t come to my location and it was driving around instead, the driver didn’t reply to any of my message where he is. After 15 minutes of trying, waiting and searching I gave up and caught taxi on the street because I really had to go. Btw normal taxi was 70% cheaper!!!! The customer service was absolutely horrible and refused to refund my money or get me some voucher. They were constantly ending the chat in the middle of conversation. Please don’t bother to use this app and take normal taxi. | I was using careem for years, Im done with this app as they charge me more money for fault of their captain which drive me in wrong location and I almost missed flight! Never again! | I am abroad and would like to cancel my Careem+ subscription but the app won’t let me because I allegedly don’t have internet access (of course I have internet, how else would I write this review?) | 2 worst ever experiences: first, the taxi driver went to a wrong place (wrong guidance by the app?) and asked me to cancel the trip and then the support didn’t return me the money citing some absurd regarding not having a local phone number. Second, the same car has been assigned to me and another rider - surely an IT mistake! Both cases are from April 5th. | Bad | Worst app, incapable service, always late, never using again, over charging money, zero customer support more like customer disgust . Just horrible… literally anything else is better even nothing. | I just wanted one item to be delivered but there is no information in the whole App customer journey saying the item can’t exceed particular size and weight so after 20 minutes waiting for the driver I just got a call from call center that it won’t be delivered and I will be charged anyway. Very bad customer experience and the improvement is so easy!!! Just add a sentence behind the note “captain can buy items up to maximum amount of 350 AED and size that won’t exceed x and weigh up to y”. You will avoid many complaints. Thank you. | Taxis are comming more and more LATE!!! | Now with Covid it’s a pain to get taxis for a family of 4 since front seat sitting is restricted.  With the app you are able to book various sizes easily.  Note that for the airport make sure to book the wheel chair accessible van in order to fit 4 people and luggage. | I used Careem in Amman and had the worst experience.

Pomalá, platba projde možna na podruhé. Prostě kekel. | Aplikace neustale nacita zony. A nikdy nenacte. | Aplikaci trvá desítky vteřin načíst zóny na mapě, platební brána funguje tak každý třetí pokus. | Zlatá stará verze téhle aplikace. Nova verze je nepřehledná, načítá se i 30s než můžete vybrat lístek! Udělejte s tím už něco! | Update: po generační změně aplikace, kdy byla přidána možnost platby přes ApplePay, tak jsem měl chvíli pocit, že problém s QR kódy byl vyřešen. Sice aplikace vykazovala pomalejší odezvu, ale kódy načítala a platba přes ApplePay rovněž fungovala. Bohužel po cca měsíci už není možné vůbec přes QR kód zaplatit, kód je údajně neplatný nebo se vůbec nenačte. Takže použití aplikace člověka pouze rozpálí doběla a musí běžet k automatu, kde je fronta 20 lidí. Opakovaně říkám - škoda, mohlo by to být super, ale muselo by to spolehlivě fungovat. | Aplikace se zabydlel v Dinamicis ostrově a nejde se jí zabavit. Parkovací lístek dávno vypršel, apku i ukončím, ale stejně je tam.
Navíc polohu to určuje vždycky hrozně dlouho a vždycky blbě. | Při scanu qr kódu nedochází k jeho načtení, aplikace vypíše chybu ze se zřejmě jedna o jiný qr kód.
Při GPS lokalizaci nebyla zcela správně načtena poloha a tak mi aplikace přiřadila jinou zónu.

Pokud se nacházím uvnitř budovy, nelze mnohdy aplikaci využít vůbec, neboť manuální vyber “kde parkuji” nelze provést, a GPS nechytne signál. | ať zvolim nové GUI, nebo staré GUI, vypl jsem automatický vyber zóny, smazal, reinstaloval a znova, po 30 sekundách, to padne a pak nejde už ani zapnout. iPhone XR | Od aktualizace nefunkcni,pada,nelze pouzit | Super aplikace, urcite doporučuji😀
Nová verze je skvělá! | Dobrý den, aplikace funguje v celku dobře a jsem s ní spokojený. Jediný problém, který dokáže nepříjemně překvapit je, že aplikace nepracuje s online časem. Připravil jsem si v aplikaci nákup parkovacího lístku předem a platbu provedl až po zaparkování. K mému překvapení se ale na lístek propsal starý čas - tedy čas, kdy jsem si parkovací lístek připravil. | Po redizajne sa mi aplikácia používa o dosť lepšie, len by som poprosil doplniť o slovenský jazyk. | Aplikace Vám umožní zakoupit si parkovací lístek i když je třeba svátek a parkování se neplatí.🫤 Chtělo by to nějaké upozornění. Např. cizinci nemusí vědět, že je u nás státní svátek.🤷‍♂️ | Aplikace laguje.
Na Androidu běží v pohodě, ale na iOSu se neskutečně seká.
Prosím o revizi. | Dobrý den,
všude vidím, že je možné platit s Apple Pay, ale aplikace to reálně neumožňuje? UX je též jak z prvních aplikací. Dle ostatních recenzí to není individuální názor... | Aplikace nepodporuje ApplePay, zároveň aplikace po zaplacení padá a není možné si zobrazit platbu. Městské policii jsem musel pracně dohledat přes internet potvrzení o zaplacení parkovného | Dobry den, proc aplikace nepodporuje tak zasadni vec, jakou je ApplePay? Bude dodano v novejsi verzi? | S iOS17 se na iPhoneSE 2020 nedá ani zapnout. Otevře se v jednom z dvaceti pokusů.
Pokud si chcete přidat kartu, tak máte smůlu, při pokusu o přidání karty do aplikace se hryzne a přestane odpovídat.
Nevím co je tak složitého na tom, vytvořit aplikaci co jde zapnout… | Po instalaci iOS 17 přestala aplikace fungovat. Spustí se úvodní obrazovka a po několika vteřinách se vypne. Děje se i po přeinstalování aplikace. | jakmile aplikaci spustím, okamžitě spadne odzkoušeno na 2 telefonech chodím přes web | Proč nelze platit pomoci Apple Pay? | Kdyby šlo dat 0 hvězdiček tak to dam. Aplikace jako z roku 1998 , když se člověk konečně dostane k placeni tak musí ručně vypisovat údaje z karty . Nejde ApplePay v roce 2023. | Bohužel v mém městě nefungují jiné aplikace než Sejf (což je vtip z let 2000-2010, který nechápu, že je ještě možné jej v toce 2023 nainstalovat, ale to sem nepatří) a právě Parksimply.
Ocenil bych:
- lepší a intuitivnější práci s mapou s náhledy zón
- možnost skrýt klávesnici odklikem/gestem - protože jakmile kliknu na zónu, najede formulář s klávesnicí a na mapu / o krok zpět se prostě nedostanu, takže vynucený restart aplikace a jde se do mapy znovu - což je brutálně frustrující a přijde mi to prostě odfláklé
- je rok 2023, Apple Pay by nebyl?

Jako jinak to běhá, ale je to frustrující zkušenost, když to srovnám s přívětivým UX a funkcemi aplikací CityMove nebo MPLA, které znám z jiných měst, ale které bohužel ""naprosto úžasný"" parkovací systém v mém ""pokrokovém"" městě nepodporuje... | Presne takto nechcete aby vyzerala apka na parkovanie. Pomale, neprehladne, keby bola na vyber moznost platit v automate alebo budce, bude to rychlejsie.
Aplikace nema ani schopnost kopirovat cislo karty pre platbu, proste uzasne zmrvena vec. | První šok - pokus o platbu, platil jsem RB kartou a musel jsem vypisovat číslo karty, snad první aplikace na iPhone kde nefunguje ApplePay. Šok druhý - poté, co jsem úspěšně autorizoval platbu, aplikace zamrzla. Po restartu app jsem zaplaťpánbůh parkovné viděl. To nejlepší nakonec - po nějaké době jsem si chtěl ověřit kolik mám času a aplikace už ani nenaběhla! Sorry, ale je to crap! | Při zadávání údajů aplikace několikrát spadla. Naštěstí si alespoň pamatuje RZ vozidla. Nicméně slibované ApplePay není, musíte ručně zadat číslo karty, což při možnosti zkopírovat ho z bankovní aplikace nechápu. Když to nabízí banka a je s tím v pohodě, proč to platební brána neumožňuje?
Ale jako test odolnosti vašich nervů je to dobré. Zvlášť když po zaparkování spěcháte na autobus a na parkovišti máte na výběr buď automat na mince (a kdo nosí běžně 200 v mincích?), nebo tuhle dementní aplikaci co padá.
Vývojář na to asi kašle, když poslední update byl před 8 mesici. | Skoda ze sem nejde prilozit fotka. Kazdopadne aplikace nefunguje. Napad je to pekny, jen skoda ze se ho neujal někdo, kdo umí vyvíjet aplikace. | ApplePay nelze použít, nelze vložit zkopírované číslo karty z bankovní aplikace - je nutné ho zadávat ručně, takže nakonec je rychlejší vhodit mince do automatu. Vývojář zjevně přemýšlel pouze nad tím, kolik si za platbu přirazí, ale nikoliv nad tím, jak uživateli usnadnit platbu za parkování. | Za mě všechno funguje. Snad jedině hledání toho kde jsem, by bylo fajn na kliknuti jako má v Praze Citymove | A nicemu nefunguje nehleda zbytecna aplikace | Je to nějaká univerzální aplikace a ne nativní pro iOS. Neumí Apple Pay. Pomalé a nepřehledné. Aplikace tak minulého století. | Aplikace splňuje svůj účel a funguje tak jak má. Díky | kartu musite mit pri sobe a nelze jeji udaje registrovat pri nastaveni aplikace to je teda fakt vychytavka jak od Ládi Hrušky. | I přes velmi dobré připojení k internetu (data, wifi, hotspot) se nedaří aplikaci stáhnout mapu kde se aktuálně zdržuji - opakované výpadky zaznamenané v Plzni, Praze, Chebu a dalších místech… | Parkovací poplatek 70 Kč mi byl stržen z účtu, ale parkovací lístek se v aplikaci neobjevil. Musel jsem zaplatit znovu v automatu. | No evidentne da. UX lvl 90's, ale hlavne...nejde s ni zaplatit parkovani 🙈 zlaty MPLA | Myslím si ze IT si s takovým problémem pořadí pi načtení QR kódu spadne ….. tím pádem když chcete po hokeji kde je fronta 20metru využít pravé tuto aplikaci tak mate smůlu! Kdyby fungovala verim , ze by ji použilo spoustu lidi takhle k …….. | Složité, komplikované, pomalé, nestabilní. 

Není možná platba přes Apple Pay a ve výsledku je cena VYŠŠÍ než u termináni na parkovišti. V mém případě 180 vs 200Kč. | Pokud potřebujete rychle odjet a zaplatit, použijte aplikaci která je rychlá a funkční. Akorát že vůbec | ParkSIMPLY. 
No bohužel není tak simply jak o sobě tvrdí. Nejde přidat platební karta, chybějící Apple pay v roce 2023 vypovídá hodně o přístupu vývojářů. Nepodařilo se mi zaplatit ani v jednom z případů co jsem to zkoušel. Dnes je v HK hokej a v parkovacím domě se obvykle tvoří několika minutové fronty plné velice “příjemných” lidí. Rád bych si takovou zkušenost odpustil právě vaší aplikací. Bohužel nelze a tak dávám 1⭐️ 
Pokud se vám podaří aplikaci dostat aspon na úroveň funkčnosti, rád ohodnotím lépe a doporučím. Dnes bohužel takto. | Aplikace nejde otevřít. Otevře se startovací okno a po nějaké chvíli se aplikace zavře. | Ukradlo mi to peníze, a závora mě nepustila, takže jsem platil 2x, NIKDO TO NESTAHUJTE | Nejde zaplatit. Po potvrzení platby v bance aplikace zamrzne. | Dřív pokaždé kdy jsem zaplatil, aplikace spadla a nešla znovu otevřít, musel jsem odinstalovat a znovu nainstalovat. To se děje pořád, jenže teď aplikace vůbec nefunguje, píše to že se aplikaci nepodařilo načíst servery nebo co a že nemám přístup k internetu. To samé se děje i kamarádce a oba jsme momentálně na wifi. | Celkem fajn. Jen by bylo dobry, kdyby v appce byly vsechny zakoupeny listky (platby), ne jen ten posledni. Pred Policii se tezko obhajuje cela doba parkovani. | Na starem iPhone 8 ani na novem iPhone 13 mini nefunguje. Po zaplaceni a ulozeni platebni karty nebo po zvoleni bezplatneho parkovani appka prestane fungovat. Nepomuze ani zavreni a znovu otevreni. Jedine reseni je smazat a znovu nainstalovat. | Je to tak tezky udelat jednoduchou a funkcni aplikaci??? | Zadam SPZ, vyberu zonu, zadam kod vcetne FNHK na zacatku, kod nenalezen. Zadam kod bez FNHK na zacatku, aplikace beze zpravy spadne. Takto to je uz cca ctvrt roku. Vizualne je to appka na urovni studenta stredni skoly. Doufam, ze Fakultni nemocnice Hradec Kralove za provoz nic neplati. | Dobrý den, dnes jsem si nainstalovat tuto aplikaci, po zaplacení na vybraném místě v Hradci mi už aplikace nechce naskočit.

Більше  дозволів | Рекомендую для подорожі і відпочинку в країни де проблема з інтернетом ! Працює на всі 100%!  Купляв 10 Gb! Не пожалкуете!!!! | 👍🏻 | Over time, the developer turned the map of free wifi points into an app for collecting and selling data on the prevalence of phones, their carrier and current data connection. Advertising everywhere, every click makes you pay. | Over time, the authors destroyed the app. Annoying ads. Whatever you click on, a subscription pops up. Forcing you to constantly buy a VPN probably so they can steal user data and sell stats on what users are looking at. With any luck there will be a wifi password in the app but probably just old passwords. I also don't plan on adding anything new since the app is such a bazmek. | I really lile the idea of the app. It is so useful. | Good idea | Proste nejvic volnych wifi hesel pro. Eskou republiku. Funguje to i s navigaci a urvite se vyplsti si koupit verzi premium. Diky | Ads ads and only ads....or pay to get a chance to connect to some of wifi provided by us - users :) even offline wifi APs are paid so the only way is to connect while you're already online...ohh wait... XD | Z | Over 600 MB data usage since last week and I didn’t use the app over a year. What were these data used for? | Useless | Ikdyž je tam zkušební 3 denní období, tak to chce potvrdit předplatné, jinak aplikace nefunguje. Takže je na dvě věci … | The App is useless. The old version was better. Now you can no longer sort by age. It cost much more time to find usable wifi network. | Skvělá app dopurucuju všem | It wont show you any passwords unless you pay them. So its a Scam and useless. | Nefunkci | Funguje super, ale pozor běží na pozadí žere zdroje a skenuje neustále vaše okolí asi. Ve vytížení baterie ukazuje staly provoz na pozadí i když je vypnuta. Snadno se necháte zlákat na sdílení vlastního hesla na Wi-Fi - pak se vám bude dom připojovat cizi lidé. Doporučuji jen s opatrnosti, když vite jak správně používat. Ale jinak funguje maximálně dobre. | Very useful app, probably the best in the Czech Republic. You can find WiFi & passwords quickly and easily. Thank you 👍👌 | Jen mi chybí čeština | Super funguje | Ale WYFIČ byl lepší!!! | Ačkoli jsem zakázal aktualizace na pozadí, notifikace a vyhledávání přes Siri, aplikace každý den běží 30 minut na pozadí a spotřebuje okolo 5% baterky.
Většina aplikací takto shromažďuje data a někam je posílá, aniž by o tom uživatel věděl/měl nad tím kontrolu.
Nebrat. | Aplikace fungující on-line je zpracována celkem dobře. Reklamy ve free verzi akceptovatelné. Bohužel hesla do sítí moc aktuální nejsou. Ze tří Wi-fi sítí v dosahu, které program znal nefungovalo ani jedno:(
To už je spíše o lidech, aby sdíleli hesla. | Super | Nejlepší appka co znám | 👏🏿bravo | Skoda ze neni v cestine. | Myslim ze casto pomoze a ulahci zhananie hesla :( | Great :-) | Prakticke, ale vetsinou verejnezname site. | Super | Thx | Nice | (Y) | Thank you so very much for such extraordinary ap | Hlavně ve městech kde je Wi-Fi na každém rohu super vychytavka. | Funkční a praktické | This is the best app for free wifi/internet. | Je to super takhle nepotřebuji data ve škole a nikdo z učitelů o tom neví | Dobré to je | Kdyz clovek není na datech, tak je aplikace nefunkční. Dost reklam | Skvělá appka👍 | Na aplikaci zdarma je to super.... | Aplikace má trochu moc reklam, občas překáží i na mapě. | Bezva napad | Easy | Zbytečná apliakce | Super | Aplikace funguje.

Muy buena | Did not inform clearly about the need to have some special paper driving license. I was denied to pick up the car at the location. Our vacation was ruined. Rentalcars did not appologizie at all and kept our money. Would not recommend to anybody!!! | Simple smart easy to use I like it very much 😉👍 | The booking works seamlessly yet with one huge drawback. The local renting company tries to make money on full insurance - as with only excess insurance covering only up to 1500 € you might pay unforeseen costs. E.g. in Sicily the price of the full insurance was additional 56% of the original rent fee paid beforehand.
I would recommend the full insurance option to be part of the initial booking so that such rip off is not possible.",4.69088,1569,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/fd/a5/9d/fda59dba-8de9-093f-0487-e587a80965d5/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/46/6e/4a/466e4a81-f116-a9b5-9a57-82355004b15c/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/a2/a4/65/a2a46594-9370-b1d1-906a-8043c2a1af16/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/94/3d/19/943d19fb-b96a-4a4b-bf7b-c7a28cff9f8b/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/64/28/25/64282539-627f-1731-c1eb-37c7ae9f2f28/pr_source.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Podle mě je tahle aplikace jenom nějakej sociální experiment/prank. | z ničeho nic mi aplikace přestala fungovat..prodloužení mám zaplacené | It would be really nice to implement apple wallet support. We have a turnstille in the entrance to our university and i always have to unpack my whole bag to find my isic, so it would be really nice to just beep with your phone and go…..
Thanks | kokotska aplikace nefunguje | Since new update, the app doesn’t load ISIC card😔☹️ | Even though the update from September 2nd was supposed to fix the issue of the app not working it is still not working, very onfuriating. I need the app in trains etc where O jave my strong mobile data, not wifi, but the app just doesn’t load :) :) | Just had a brilliant experience with this app when i forgot my physical card and wanted to use the app instead but i didn’t load at all. | Aplikace se ani nenačte a ihned spadne. Co s tím? Potřebuji se prokazovat Isic kvůli slevám a teď to nelze. Fyzickou podobu karty nemívám vždy u sebe, vždy jsem si vystačila s aplikaci. | It’s much swifter to pull my ISIC out of my wallet. No, seriously, is it necessary to load ads/cooperations in order to show an ISIC? This is fast as slug even on fast wifi, this implementation made me believe physical cards ain’t that bad. | Karta se vůbec nenačte. | Při otevření aplikace probíhá pouze načítání a při zadání hesla pro zobrazení průkazu se nic nezmění a probíhá načítání. | ISIC card fails to load more than half the time. Considering that’s the apps main purpose its quite bad | V poslední době se nechce zobrazit isic karta. Nefunguje ani na wifi ani na mobilních datech. Prosím o opravu. | I always have to reinstall it, because it never works. | Sometimes apps won't load when connected via LTE, but only over WiFi. But after a while even that doesn't work and I have to reinstall the app. | Nespolehlivá aplikace, při první použití bylo vše v pořádku, ale potom už se nikdy nenačetla. Ani přeinstalování nepomohlo. | Nefunguje to kolikrát ani s připojením k internetu, dlouho se to načítá a samo se to odhlašuje. Na aplikaci není spolehnutí. | Po dlouhé době bezproblémového používání přestala fungovat. Málem jsem kvůli ní dostal pokutu v MHD. | Bylo by fajn zůstat přihlášen i po zavření aplikace 🙃 | Karta se načítá jen někdy, většinou ne. | Při kliknutí na zobrazení karty, se ukáže, že se karta nedá zobrazit z důvodu nepřipojení k internetu a protože se musí stáhnout. Internet zaplý je a stejně nefunguje | Přehledná aplikace s digitálním průkazem a studentskými slevami, díky ISIC jsem ušetřil spoustu peněz. S akceptací digitálního průkazu jsem neměl nikde problém, ale ocenil bych podporu NFC pro vstup do školy. | Aplikace funguje. Používám každý den pro doložení studentské slevy. | Dříve fungovala, teď tomu tak není, po spuštění se zobrazí jen černá obrazovka (tudíž ani odhlášení a znovu přihlášení není možné) | Vše funguje jak by mělo!☺️ | Asi měsíc aplikace fungovala, pak se něco změnilo. Když kliknu na “ukázat průkaz”, objeví se jen nekonečné načítání. Už mě to stálo fakt dost peněz. | Kinda ok, would be nice if it worked with official isic account. | I’ve got this app half of year in my phone… never worked. I’m uninstalling it rn.. | Bohužel se mi nedaří se přihlásit.Na webu se normálně přihlásím, v Appce ne.První jsem si myslela, že jsem jen zapomněla heslo, ale při požádání o heslo mi to oznámilo, že je email nesprávný,takže asi ho to nevidí v systému. | Unreliable application, not working without the internet connection and sometimes not working even with internet connection | Není co dodat | Podařilo se mi do aplikace dostat, ale ukazuje mi to úplně jinou školu, než na které opravdu studuji. Jinak všechny ostatní informace souhlasí. 🤔 | Nelze se přihlásit do systému, vyhazuje chyby s uživatelským jménem a heslem. Chyba se reálně nevyskytuje, aplikace nefunkční | ПРИЛОЖЕНИЕ ХЕРНЯ.

Great job!! | Absolutely worst airline app ever. Is there in Swiss somebody who understand what is mobile app?? I always find my booking, add it to my flights and then look to ""my floghts"" and is says all time: You have no flight! Absolutely idiot app! I must add Swiss floghts to my Lufthansa app because this one is total no work. Swiss, please hire to IT director somebody who know what he do... | Live notifications from airport dont work. Also its just a thin wrapper for booking management, doesnt look very nice. | I very appreciate features of this app. I can choose the seat, make check-in and get boarding pass comfortably sitting at home 😍

Nothing have to be printed, you should only show QR code in app at luggage desk and at gate desk.

Saves energy and environment 👍

From my point of view: 10/10 | to do checking means running browser. and writing that application of eurowings is not the most updated. what? i need to do check inf for swiss. not usable at all | The app seems fine but key functions like directly add ticket to Apple wallet is not supported on this app !! You must send e-mail with ticket and after that you can add tickets to the apple wallet..for e-mail i wait 15 mimutes !!(internet connection was fine),  I send my tickets by SMS (with country prefix) after 25 minutes nothing arrived!! In app is marked that i am checked..but after this I don t trust this app | everything works well in the app | Nothing special. | Diese Applikation sollten Konkurrenten als Vorbild nehmen!! | The iPhone version will not let me login either once I'm choosing password longer than 12 chars or once I am using special char.

Na trasách vás aplikace upozorní na zajímavá místa, která byste jinak mohli minout bez povšimnutí a můžete také sbírat virtuální druhy rostlin a živočichů, o kterých se formou krátkých zajímavostí dozvíte spoustu informací. Ke každému druhu si navíc můžete vyplnit i zábavné kvízy.

Aplikace vás formou chytrých notifikací informuje o vstupu do chráněných území, poskytne důležité informace o pravidlech chování a vysvětlí důvody případných zákazů či dočasných omezení. Díky tomu se uživatelé učí, jak přírodu respektovat a každý tak může přispět k ochraně biodiverzity. 
Ve spolupráci se všemi českými národními parky a Agenturou ochrany přírody a krajiny (AOPK) aplikace na jednom místě sdružuje aktuální informace národních parků a chráněných krajinných oblastí v ČR. Uživatelé jsou tak informováni o aktualitách, pořádaných akcích, uzavírkách či dočasných omezeních.

EPU také poskytuje komunitní platformu, kde mohou uživatelé snadno pořádat různé dobrovolnické akce, exkurze, společné výlety či nahlásit závadu na trase. Komunita může sloužit také pro sdílení zážitků a fotografií, uživatelé mohou diskutovat o trasách a získávat cenné rady od ostatních cestovatelů.","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple221/v4/27/1c/3b/271c3b7d-c5d1-eb1d-229c-de148940e19b/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007ephone-0-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Education""]","[""6003"",""6017""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""CS""]","68709376","16.0","2024-03-21T07:00:00Z","2024-04-01T06:54:23Z","- oprava chybného výpočtu rozlohy oblasti

What is language exchange?
Tandem language learning is the process of joining forces with someone who is a native speaker of the language you want to learn. Through conversation with your Tandem partner, known as language exchange, you improve your language skills and develop intercultural competence.

Tandem’s core value is to unite people across borders through language learning. Languages hold great power for unity, inclusivity, and equality. Language and cultural exchange are keys to unlock global understanding in our increasingly interconnected world. 

How to learn languages on Tandem:
1. Select the language(s) you want to learn in the app
2. Tell us about your language learning goals and your ideal Tandem partner
3. Search for native speakers of your target language in the community 
4. Kick-off your language exchange experience by sending your first message
5. Share topics with the Tandem community so you can have meaningful conversations about what interests you
6. Keep up the conversation with your new Tandem “pen pal” and speak like a native in no time!

Definetelly cant reccomend. | I had hope in this one. When I was done signing up, it said “almost done, you need to be verified the wait time can be up to 2 weeks!” Two weeks!? I’ve waited for three months. Nothing. Left it be, I forgot about it and now de-discovered it being on my phone for about a year now, still nothing. Two weeks? Y’all gotta fix this | Nothing to say about the scope of the app and how it let us reach the goal of connecting with other people who want to learn languages like us, but the UX of the app is below average. The onboarding experience has been a nightmare, forcing me to switch from desktop to mobile, lot of forced steps before even seeing the app, the filtering when I try to look for the right people in my area fail on many UI principles, and I could continue but I’ll just say that there’s a lot to improve. Contact me if you want the help of a Lead UX Designer ;) | It is great to talk to people from all around the world | I found this app for practicing Japanese☺️ People here are really welcoming and have the same goal as me (Learn the language). There I found a lovely girl, which is my friend now. The function of spelling and translating is amazing. | Whenever I try to use my external ipad keyboard to write a message the chatbox disappears… So I can either write blind or use the touch keyboard, which is kinda inconvenient. :( | The application opened automatically in Ukrainian.  I do not know why. | best app | After some negative experiences with other so-called language exchange apps, I’m really glad I was recommended to try Tandem. 

Most users there really want to learn languages and don’t misuse it as a dating app.

Also, It was super easy to find people to talk with who are happy to help me. I was even contacted by an amateur teacher who gives me lessons every week. So I’m very excited about the results.

I’ve even taken their certificate, and to be honest, I was really pleasantly surprised by its quality.

The chat is nice as well, moreover, it offers many features making the communication easier.

So far I’ve only found two issues within the app:

1) There is a bug on changing the profile picture. I’ve reported it about two months ago, but so far the error still occurs.

2) It would nice to have an option to view people who want to learn my native language to help them (no matter what their nationality is). So far I can only see people speaking the language I am learning.

So it would be nice to change these things, however, the rating is still 5 stars for me. | In my opinion, this kind of app should have a large base of users so you can easily find someone to chat with. Like seriously? noone here seems active in usuing the app! So do you think learning a language is as easy as clicking a thumb? The idea is good, but it doesnt give good results, sorry. | Many users block others based on looks alone. A lot of them use Tandem to find partners. The PRO program is terrible. 

Please don’t bother! | Awesome, fun & easy to use APP | I joined Tandem around two and a half years ago. I had a pretty basic english back then and I improved a ton just by speaking to people. I also find some great friends and to some of which I talk to this day. I can strongly recommend this app to anyone who’s interested in getting their practical language skills to the next level. | I’m giving 1 star purely for the “you have to actually wait for up to 7 days to really access the app”. That’s what I was told when I finished the registration? Don’t like it? No problem, you can pay for TANDEM PRO just so you can actually use our app. Ridiculous

Use Interpals.net instead, it’s for free and it works from the beginning | I really want to learn German and I found that HelloTalk is pretty good to start speaking... actually if you don’t pay it’s not but than I installed Tandem and it’s better it’s on the same principe but better you choose the topics and alle the people I’ve written yet we’re extremely nice to me, you can see who’s online and who’s not but most of the people answer pretty quick...

Highly recommend haven’t seen a mistake yet... | I have to say that I find Tandem one of the best language learning apps. It is easy to use and you can talk to people from all over the world and practice your language skills while getting to know different cultures.
I am not sure if it is good app for beginners but you can definately give it a shot. :-)

And that one star down is because of missing landscape mode of this app on iPad... it kinda drives me crazy when I am using keyboard. But don`t get me wrong, I love it anyway! | The experience in tandem has been overall positive, I’ve learnt a lot. But there is someone who is stalking me, and tandem hasn’t helped me so much. | After update 100%, fully recomended | Top language learning app in Appstore. There are many helpful features. And many people who really want to communicate.. This is really not another dating service. But it drains battery like hell. | Defo recommend | It really helps to develop your skills at language. Talking with people all around the world is also educational and you learn a lot of interesting things. | It's a really great idea and app, but it might still use some improvement. To be able to change the orientation, it is only portrait mode even on iPads, I would like to have a portrait mode also when using the iPad keyboard. The voice messages should not be sent right away after releasing the button, but the user should have an option to check the voice message before sending.

They’re basically just bad websites in the shape of an app. Delta’s app has some of these details but is better than the competition.

But it is still a painful, often useless and broken app.

The app constantly reports errs with no explanation. In the case of network errors once encountered they can’t be reaolved without restarting the app, no matter how good your network.

The upcoming trips UI is a mess. It doesn’t even have my flight dates. It shows I have a trip from the 5th to the 23rd for example but when you tap into the detail the flights themselves don’t have this info. And indeed due to the time difference my return flight was shown as leaving at 1.35AM. On the 23rd? No dear boy, the 24th. If I were to use the app as my primary Delta tool, which is kind of the goal, I’d probably miss my flight.

Likewise the profile system is barebones.

I’m lactose intolerant and can’t set a special meal as a default. Delta optimistically assumes I might be cured someday and so I have to manually add my special meal for each. And. Every. Flight.

As software goes this is truly a brick. | Doesn’t work, I was not able to check in any flight. 5 passangers.. only 2 of them checked in! | It working compare to some apps from competition. | For online check-in, the app was utterly unusable: it didn’t allow to add any checked bags even though I had allowance for two. Human check-in had no such problems. On the day of my flight, the “Today” screen reported repetitive failures when updating the state of my flight. The airport website was much more useful. | ...unstable. I really like the idea of having all my flight info via Delta in my pocket. Actually, I still like it, it's awesome. Booked a trip to NYC in September, wanted to use the app to select my seats (I was going for the Comfort+ seats in the Economy class), but everytime I try to enter my MasterCard data, the app collapses upon tapping the expiration date selection.

Make step-free journeys and look up station facilities. See on the map when stations and lifts are closed. Walking or cycling? Our reliable journey planner will map a safe route.

The app is built around our iconic Tube map. To get started:
• Touch the map or search to plan your journey
• See the status of all lines
• Check how busy each London Underground station is right now
• Re-route as you travel - we’ll suggest alternatives
• Switch to the step-free map for accessible journeys
• Find out when your next train, bus or tram is due
• Look up which platform your train will arrive on
• See when the stations you want to travel through are quieter
• Check out station information and facilities such as toilets

Most recently we’ve:
• Added more information about station toilets – find out where they are by gender and which ones are accessible and/or with baby changing facilities
• Built a new map showing nearby bus stops – making it simple to see where you can catch your bus from
• Refreshed the navigation – it’s even easier to get to the features you want

Our simple and clear layout is designed to make using the app easy for everyone.

Planning your journey: We’ll suggest multiple ways to get to your destination – you pick the one that suits you best. Choose the quickest journey, bus-only or one that’s step-free.

Check before you travel: See how the line is running and when to expect your next Tube, bus, train or tram

Freedom to explore: Choose the right travel options if you or someone you’re travelling with needs to avoid steps, lifts onto a train or in a station.

Bus stops near you: Find the bus stop nearest to where you are, and next bus live arrival information for every route.

Available underground via Wi-Fi (or 4G in some places) for live updates on the go.

All I can do is to cancel subscription and write down this review. | Já mám stažené všechny mapy ale chybí info že budu překračovat státní hranici třeba Maďarsko-Srbsko a nikde žádná zmínka že budou státní hranice. To samé Srbsko-Makedonie atd. Díky | Nemá v databázi čísla popisné. To neni dobrá mapa. | Dobrý den. Aplikace jako jedna z mála neumí nastavit jestli bude zvuk hrát z telefonu, nebo z Bluetooth zařízení v autě. Musí se nastavovat ručně při každém spuštění. Druhá věc je, že neumí hledat čísla popisný ve městech. Starší verze TomTom to bez problémů zvládaly. Jinak TomTom používám asi 15let a mám ho rád. Prosím o opravu těchto chyb. Děkuji. | Perfect application. slightly better than Sygic. I only regret two things. The first is that you don't have a lifetime license, for example for €65 and then a year-long overpayment for radar and driving around columns. The second thing is that there is no option on the route to cancel or set the option to change the road in a certain state, as Sygic has. At least the second thing would be great. | Nejlepší navigace | Pros: clear design, good navigation, info how far to the next petrol station, independent of mobile signal, good price, average speed in measured sections
Cons: long starting time at carplay auto, auto changing scheme color is annoying (others can change the scheme with lights on/off. There is some inbuild time schedule, which means you have full power of display brightness in very dard places during day - tunels etc), not so fast traffic recalculation, very slow at updates of maps (the last one where I can’t see the new roads - apple maps shows these roads already instead they use the TomTom data??) | Dobrý den, 
navigace je za mě super!! Nikdy nezklamala jenom bych poprosil update na Ipad 🥹💁.
Dekuju, pak rád dám 5 hvězdiček. 
K | Daf XG :working with AppleCarPlay!!! | Nová verze 3.8.2 nejde aktualizovat | Applicationn won't start. I tried reinstall but it is still useles. | 3.8 pleas Update. Reinstal don't help | And it downloads for more than hour on 5G? | Aplikaci jsem si předplatil, protože jsem cestoval po USA, kde není na spoustě míst signál a potřeboval jsem proto offline navigaci. 

Nastaly 2 situace, kde jsem potřeboval navigaci použít a ani v jednom případě se navigace vůbec nenačetla. 

Za mě to byly zcela vyhozené peníze... | I’m using this app for nearly 2years. It is stable and works nice with carplay (carplay has sometimes issue wit position, which require to disconnect and navigate from phone directly). Sometimes it is hard to find address or point of interest. 
What wold be nice are following improvements:
Add possibility to import location from Google or Apple maps
Add enhanced futures to limit road based on vehicle size (in my case with camper) and add futures which would select road with nice view (for motorbike or driving with caravan)
Enhance My drive web app - it is quite difficult to plan route or add POIs. | I don’t know, maybe somewhere it works fine, but for Czechia this navigator is worst what I ever had. 1) it’s not free at all, you just have 7 days trial period, but you can’t use it till you don’t accept subscription 2) maps aren’t readable and hard for orienting in unfamiliar cities 3) you need to be prepared that this navigator just can’t find some address (Harrachov 189, for example) what Waze, Google, Mapy.cz found without any problem. And just remember that you must pay them for this…software. | I’d like to ask for advice. I’ve been using this app on iphone 14. I must have done something wring, because I am not able to find the option of planning of walking and cycling routes.
Please advise, what I should you. Of course I checked instruction manual. It simply mentiones the posdibility. I do not see it in the menu. Thanks in advance for help. Karel Schneider Prague | Happy to use TomTom with CarPlay. Only feature I am missing compare to other nav apps is voice search while driving. | I was really looking forward to trying the Tomtom after several years of using the car's built-in navigation (very good but hard to update). I immediately found that the app is not showing the traffic information along the way. I can see the traffic information in nearby areas, but it is useful only for short trips. For example, planning a trip from southern Switzerland to the Czech is impossible without any additional source like Google Maps. I can imagine that a traffic jam in Munich is not so important 4 hours ahead since it can change significantly, but road constructions could make me choose a completely different way (like Ulm, Nuremberg...)
For the planning, it would also be great to see alternative routes (sometimes the route is completely different, but the travel time is similar).
I would appreciate a button for a quick ""north-up"" map orientation when browsing through the map (it is very easy to rotate the map accidentally).
I will give it a chance, but after a first look, I am not very motivated for the subscription :-( | Assigning a waypoint sometimes doesn't work correctly - instead of the point being assigned to the current route, it is added as another point and the route is extended by that distance. Also, I'm missing the option to select my preferred fuel and gas station brand. EDIT: TomTom Go, iOS

EDIT2: No, the option to select preferred fuel and gas station brand has never existed in TomTom on iOS. My complaint is more of a feature request. | Nejen, že kdysi rozdělili navigační aplikace na Západní Evropu a Východní Evropu. Takže jsem si musel koupit obě dvě na cestu z Čech do Německa. 160€? Slibovali doživotní licenci a upgrade. A co nastalo? Vydali příšernou aplikaci TomTom Go, a “milostivě” mi dovolili jí používat rok zdarma!
JSOU TO PRACHSPROSTÝ ZLODĚJI! | Výborná offline navigace, dobře funkční CarPlay, dopravní info po Evropě s rychlým přepočtem, radary celkem dobře funkční. Uvítal bych možnost rychlého tlačítka v CarPlay pro objížďku, aby mě navigace nevracela na uzavřenou trasu po sjetí. Z aktuální nabídky offline navigaci hodnotím jako nejlepší.
Edit 13.6.2022/ ubíram hvězdu, k dokonalosti bych ještě zlepšil kontrast mapy, odlišil cesty dle třídy přehledněji, hlavně zlepšil celkové UI, zadat takovou jednoduchou věc jako adresu ci oblíbené není zrovna uživatelsky přívětivé !!! V tomhle je třeba konkurence mnohem lepší . A samozřejmě stále požadavek na objizdu v rozhraní CarPlay. | I am using TomTom on iPhone13, it has great stability, fast calculation of the route and shows on the screen just the key needed data, it is perfectly transparent and offersimmediate orientation   when one takes a quick look on phone screen while driving. Traffic data are actual. | Aktualizace 29.4.22
Objevil jsem další slabé místo této appky. Pokud se spolehnu na to, že se jedná o offline navigaci mám smůlu. Start appky a výpočet trasy musí proběhnout on-line jinak skončíte ve slepé ulici. Uzavírky i dlouhodobá omezení se načítají až při plánování trasy. Neni tedy možné být od začátku cesty offline. 
______
Začnu chválou. Grafika je přehledná a nestalo se mě, že bych ve složitých křižovatkách špatně odbočil. Výpočet trasy je lepší jak u konkurence a toho jsem mnohokrát využil. Vše by bylo na výbornou, kdyby měla navigace správné mapové podklady. Těch chyb je mnoho a trvají velmi dlouho - mapy pravidelně aktualizuji - takže problém je někde u Tomtomu. Např. trasa Praha - Liberec, po dálnici: před Libercem to vede přes vesničky, protože už skoro rok si navigace mysli, že je dálnice na Liberec zavřená. V Chotěboři je již více jak dva roky přeloženo usekové měření. Navigace to neví. Cca 25 km před Plzní po dálnici z Prahy to hlásí usekové měření, které tam není. Při vracení se zpět opět stejný problém. Do slepé ulice mě to vedlo pouze jednou, opět nebyly aktuální mapové podklady a v místě probíhala stavba. Předplatné už neobnovim. | Tak jak byl driv tom tom nejlepsi neprehlednejsi a nejucinejsi aplikace tak zde je ukazka jak se to nema delat jak z nejlepsi navigace dokazali udalat nejhorsi. Strasny neprehledny a bez funkci. Zmizeli napr obline polozky. (Nejde uz ulozit afresu a mit ji pripravenou k pouziti). Vse je kostrbate a neintuitivni. Budu doufat ze se casem vrati k puvodni aplikaci nebo ze tihle udelaji uplne odznova a poradne.

Bohuzel me totalne okradli. Zaplatil jsem tomtoma plnou cenu asi 80euro. Udelali novou navigaci a ted po me chteji platit vubrc abyvh navigaci mohl pouzit!!!! 100 kc mesicne. Dobra zlodejna. | I purchased unlimited lifetime maps TomTom Europe for my iPad TomTom stopped to support this after about a year. Gave me “unlimited” iphone Go app. No I opened it after many year to give it a try. But my it tells me that “unlimited” subscription has ended”!
NEVER NEVER AGAIN. | Dobry den, zjistil jsem ze navigace obsahuje pro me jednu zavaznou chybu, kvuli ktere je pro me v meste nepouzitelne. Pokud ma trasa obsahovat za sebou v kratkem useku (nekolik desitek mezru) 2 x odboceni do leva tak to navigace neudela, ale radsi vymysli nesmysli jak se tomu vyhnout. Prosim o opravu zminene chyby at mohu opet navigaci pouzivat. V pripadr potreby jsem ochoten sdelit emailem vic podrobnosti popr. zaslat i printscreen. | I have to admit that TomTom evolved a lot since I’ve used it years ago. Subscription prices are reasonable, map updates are frequent, and maps are also quite reliable. Traffic info, voice instructions, speed limits, lane navigation, sectional speed measuring, faster route suggestion, and other useful related features are all available within your subscription without any extra payments. The interface is well designed, it is stable, and all works well together. Even voice commands and street names reading is available and correct in Czech which Sygic has still issues with even years after I’ve reported that bug there.

If I could have one request, I would welcome an option to automatically download and install map updates. There could be options for automatic install like Always (Wi-fi & Mobile data), Wi-fi only, and Never (which is the only “option” now). | I like the app a lot, it works very well. | . Thanks for answer, but still facing the same issue. If I forgot to run application on iPhone, I cannot run your app even on iPhone and car. Other navigation I can run without running on phone. | Very slow loading. It has a loading bug when connected to Apple car. So annoying.
EDIT: tip from the support is not helping at all. :( | Kde najdu v aplikaci přepnutí na nákladní vozy ? | Již několik let používám TomTom, nyní se v něm objevila chyba, která znemožňuje použití aplikace. Podpora nereaguje na několik žádosti o vyřešení, budu muset s aplikaci skončit. | Navigace by byla fajn na 4-5 hvězd, zvláště za navigaci v pruzích, ta je skvělá, prostředi se mi líbí více než u jiných navigací, ale protože neumí navigovat ( vyhledat) číslo popisné, tak je v podstatě nepoužitelná. Viz. město Libušín (nenajde ani jednu adresu! ) a ve dalších menších městech a vesničkách bohužel také ne. Vždy najde jen ulici, ale číslo popisné nenajde ani když jej zadáte z adresáře. Škoda. Všechny další navigace tuto základní funkci zvládají bez problému, jen Tom Tom to prostě neumí. Proč? | Horrible UI | V SRN máte rychlostní limit 130 km v hodině. Takže neustále svítí zvýrazněná stotřícítka kvůli překročení rychlosti. | Пару лет назад использовал на Андроиде, почти идеально. На iOS возникли. 
Раздел с картами Германии называется «Германия». Вложенные карты регионов Германии поименованы как «Нiмеччина Пiвденний Захiд» и так далее. Не лучше дела и в других картах. На каком языке идёт поиск не проверял. 
Были непонятные проблемы с загрузкой карт («нет интернета»). Интернет был прекрасный. Оказывается, надо было в учётку ТомТом войти. 
Карты подвисают при использовании с CarPlay. Лечится сбросом программы на телефоне. Но в Европе телефон в руке - удовольствие не из дешевых. | Aplikace nabízí adresy ze seznamu kontaktů z telefonu. Bohužel, ani jednu nedokáže najít na mapě. Adresy jsou zadány správně. Konkurenční aplikace s tím nemají problém. | Problém s přehříváním iPhone byl vyřešen, ale dost mi chybí v CarPlay postranní lišta s dopravními informacemi. Jinak dobrá navigace. | Mám koupený traffic a velmi dobře funguje. Mnohem lepší plánování tras než Waze nebo Sygic. Po roce používání je to dle mého názoru nejlepší navigace . Carplay s alternativními trasami je super. Jen tak dále moc děkuji.👍 | Vse jede tak jak ma a vyhledani adres a navigace na jednicku . Diky | Špatné vyhledávání města a ulice. Asi jsem zvyklý na navigaci TomTom XL, kdy bylo všechno přehledné při zadávání adresy. Nevím proč to není i tady. Jinak navigace super. Ale když chci navigovat, tak si chci prvně zadat stát pak město ulici a č.p. a to v této navigaci nejde. Proto za mě palec dolů | Nefunguje rodinné sdílení, na help line mi nepomohli, prý to nefunguje kvůli aktualizacím pro i Phone.... největší blbost, jakou jsem slyšel. 
Jinak aplikace funguje skvěle. | Very good app. I used it on phone and it is the best one. Now I have moved to Carplay and there are some things I’m missing. Please add current speed circle beside the speed limit. And at least some traffic preview info. I’m missing route bar a lot. I saw in Sygic it is possible so it seems Carplay display limitations aren’t so restrictive. Thanks in advance. | Aplikaci jsem vyskousel a pak jsem to vymazal a porad pomne chce penize,i kdyz tu aplikaci uz par mesicu mam vymazanou. | Appka funguje vcelku slušně, včetně dopravní situace a radarů, ale zásadní výtku mám k mapám. Pokud se chci při navigací podívat na název obce, popř. číslo silnice, tak mám prostě smůlu. Mapu můžu přibližovat jako o život, ale velikost písma je stále stejná a to miniaturní. Za jízdy nečitelná a tak vlastně nebezpečná! | V poslední verzi při zadání nejrychlejší trasy obchází dálnice a plánuje po okreskách. Přitom dálnice normálně průjezdná a bez nehod. | Again crash when loading maps. Additionally this week (22.7. till 24.7.) no traffic info, at least not in my trip to Germany, Austria and Italy.
Long time everything was stable and worth the money, but latest news seem to be very bad. | V CarPlay nejsou dopravní informace. Mapy dost očesané,chybí hodně názvů obcí.

To na zemi nenajdete. | Vybíjí najednou extrémně baterii!!!!😡 | Po nedávné aktualizaci aplikace neustále aktivně kontroluje polohu a výrazně zatěžuje baterii. V autě s tím človek počítá, ale s tím že se mi přes den vybije když leží na stole už ne. Pro mě velký problém! | S aplikací jsem doposud neměla problém, je to ale už pár dnů, co mi zvýšeně spotřebovává baterii. Díky tomu jsem zastavila sdílení polohy a aplikace je mi nyní k ničemu. | Bylo by fajn, pořádně tu aplikaci odladit. Především údaje o “zatáčení”. Aplikace zobrazuje nesmyslné hodnoty u kruhových objezdů a u běžné křižovatky velmi často také. Už mě unavuje mazat každou druhou jízdu, kde mám všude hodnoty 90 - 100% a u zatáčení 18%.

Ještě doplním, že s aplikací mám najeto půl roku. Což byl dostatek času na testování. | Aplikace je často velice kreativní ve vyhodnocování stylu jízdy. A také neumí zohlednit, když telefon při jízdě používá někdo jiný. Z těchto důvodů jsem používal důvod “Jiné” pro smazání jízdy. Teď chybí, místo toho, aby se např. dalo tento důvod sdělit (a tvůrce aplikace tím získal i přesnější zpětnou vazbu), tato možnost zmizela. Asi pro tyto účely začnu používat “Metro”, snad je to dostatečně absurdní volba, aby ji nikdo nebral vážně. | Chválím 👍 Je to opravdu povedená aplikace , která nutí jezdit bezpečněji. Což je jedině dobře!

Co se mi na aplikaci hodně líbí, tak je Kniha jízd a celkově vzhled a přehlednost celé aplikace. 

Můj dojem za 39 jízd je jen pozitivní. Telefon mám převážně v držáku a to funguje velice dobře, ale pokud ho někdy při krátkých přejezdech nechám v kapse u bundy, tak je to s tím měřením horší, ale co no, to už naprogramovat nejde.

Jediné co me štve, tak že jsem ještě nedostal žádnou výzvu😁 | …pres kterou se neda projit | Aplikace je super nápad jak přimět lidi jezdit slušně. 
Pěkné zpracování a dobrý přehled. Bohužel mám problém se záznamem jízdy. Z 30 minut jízdy se mi zaznamená 5-10 minut. V telefonu mám vše povoleno. Zkoušeno i na mobilu s androidem a problém byl totožný. | Aplikace mi nechce najít mou pojistnou smlouvu a tím znemožňuje její používání. | Je to super, ale pokud se hybete, tak to pousti gos a uzira baterii, skoda ze to nejde manualne vypnout kdyz vite ze jedete mhd, nebo na kole nebo behate. 
Co se tyce hodnoceni jizd, tak se to da v pohode uhlidat, az na rychlejsi rozjezdy (z krizovatky, nebo vedlejsi fakt chcete vypalit a zbytecne nezdrzovat provoz) a na zataceni (brzdit a hodne pomalu zatacet z hlavni popropade po kruhaci mi taky neprijde uplne bezpecne), ale pri trose cviku to jde.
Pouzovani telefonu za jizdy v drzaku (navigace, prijmuti hovoru na reprak) lze bez problemu. 
Jo a obcas (fakt malokdy, ale stava se) vyhodnoti diky spatne lokaci gps prudke zataceni, nebo vyssi rychlost nez jedete, ale to je spis vina gps, nez appky. | Když jedu, je to dobré, až ne nějaké nefér strhávání bodů kvůli kruhovým objezdům, kde i když najedu pomalu, gps to po prostě vyhodnotí špatně, ale dá si na to zvyknout - že nebude 100%.
Problém mám, když nikam nejedu. Jezdím autem tak 1x týdně a aplikace se opravdu velmi intenzivně snaží zjistit, jestli už třeba nejedu. Na iPhone 14pro atd, zasahuje znaménko o používání gps do ovládacího dynamic islandu a díky aplikaci si pak třeba nemohu přepínat písničky v telefonu. Musim nejdřív otevřít aplikaci, hned jí ukončit a pak mám chvilku na to, než se zase objeví prvek gps a zablokuje mi to zase možnost přepínat písničky. U málo jezdících lidí bych ocenil to, že se to dá zapnout primo v telefonu a to v moment, kdy vím že startuji… přeci je tam motivací ten cashback, ne? To je dostatečná motivace pro to, aby si na to řidič vzpomněl. 
Dále zase na druhou stranu bych zavedl něco jako potvrzení o jízdě po každé jízdě. Často jedu s někým jiným a dost často neřeším jen to, že musím myslet na to, že se mi muže uložit cizí jízda… (většinou s málo body, protože jsem na mobilu).

Manuální start měření jízdy by v mém případě vyřešil úplně vše. Ještě s myšlenkou, že jsem si na sebe zapnul “dohled” a jedu teď na body, bude to ještě více uvědomělá a soustředěná jízda. | Pokud kromě pojistěného vozidla používáte i jiné, služební, a třeba jako spolujezdec, je potřeba tyto jízdy ručně odmazávat, a je na to jen 12 hodin. A jestli jich jsou za den třeba nižší desítky, je to dost opruz. 

Nechápu, proč se aplikace nespojí s pojištěným vozidlem a nezaznamenává jen tyto jízdy. | Aplikace je hezky zpracovaná a dá se s ní ušetřit. Jenže nějaké mouchy tu přeci jen máme, třeba zatáčení na kruhovém objezdu a nebo ostřejší zatáčky (můžete jet opravdu hodně pomalu a stejně vám ji aplikace vyčte). Pokud vyjíždím na hlavní silnici a tudíž tak potřebuji vyjet rychleji abych se tam vůbec měla šanci dostat, aplikace to zaznamená jako moc velké zrychlení a odečte body. Jak se tam ale jinak dostat? To bych tam mohla taky stát celý den. Tohle by bylo potřeba zlepšit. | Iphone 12 mini. Aplikace se nedá nastavit, píše to, je funkce aktivita je pro moje zařízení nedostupné. | Aplikace používá asi staré mapy, takže ubírá skóre za rychlost na úsecích kde již několik let není snížená rychlost. Dále někdy vyhodnotí používají telefonu, kdy je telefon v tašce a nikdo na něj nesahá.  Myslím že by to chtělo aplikaci vyladit, aby odrážela pravdivě bezpečnou jízdu! | Zatim dost spatny, appka na ip 11 pred dvema tydny prestala trekovat. A to i kdyz ji tedy zkusim normalne otevrit, aby se probrala a takto mi jizdu zaznamenala jen jednou, jinak se nechyta. ios i apka aktualizovane a vsechna opravneni v tel. nastavena. Takze by mela fungovat spravne. | Poměrně často aplikace zle vyhodnotí akceleraci. Nevím jestli je to občasnou ztrátou GPS nebo něčím jiným. Snímání rychlosti a brždění funguje dobře. Stejně tak je zvláštním způsobem určováno zatáčení, kde by v zatáčkách s otočením o vic jak 90 stupňů měl člověk asi vozidlo tlačit.
Celkově je aplikace povedená, ale je co zlepšovat, jestliže se jedná o hodnotící nástroj. | Funguje dobře, a šetří peníze🥹",4.35065,154,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/8e/f3/90/8ef3905f-463d-f8ad-00dd-671706edafd3/656cfc4e-85c2-4d72-bcb6-6825811a58fb_1242x2208_01.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/98/9f/02/989f0205-d777-a5bd-1feb-ade8f65f2ab0/d1a1769b-f067-4086-9487-033c0a5ee73a_1242x2208_02.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1a/c6/18/1ac6182a-4b8d-c7bc-e30e-4a2b8c4931e6/14f6e141-045c-4776-ba73-c36736d9e319_1242x2208_03.png/392x696bb.png""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

Odladěná, uživatelsky přívětivá a hlavně mimořádně spolehlivá. Tak moc, že jí používám i místo oficiálních aplikací dopravců. Sice je placená, ale vývojáři si zaslouží každou korunu. | Far better than competing apps. Responsive, great UX. I just miss the Watch app | that’s the best public traffic app over cz. now showing actual location of a vehicle in real. | Perfektni, jen bych ocenil moznost pravidelne notifikace na urcity spoj.. napr po-pa | Hi there.. can someone explain to me who did the new design? It’s so terrible.. it was just much more synoptical before.. I miss the transportation types pictograms.. I’m so disappointed and mad about this.. you should at least bring back the pictograms. | As a daily user of the Prague transport system I find this app to be a great help. Flexible journey planning, useful info where I expect it to be, it “just works”. | Aplikaci si předplácím už 4 roky a pořád je s přehledem nejlepší a nejpřehlednější aplikace pro cestování. Autoři aplikaci stále vylepšují. Rozhodně doporučuji. | Skoda ze uz nebud dalsi podpora | Bohužel aplikace neustále nabízí nesmyslné spoje, např z Balabenka na Smichov nabízí jet tramvaji zpět na Ceskomoravskou nebo Vysocanskou, tam jít daleko na metro a zase se vracet směrem na Smichov metrem, aplikace od idosu tohle nedělá | chybí jakákoliv podpora, inovace a aktualizace ze strany vývojáře. Je to škoda | Super | Velmi propracovaná aplikace s intuitivním ovládáním. | Používám dlouho, ale viditelný vývoj už není.
Nepodporuje Apple watch a ani Widget. | Asi nejlepší aplikace na MHD, používám ji prakticky od začátku a platba 1x ročně za jízdní řády je více než adekvátní za výsledky které z aplikace dostávám včetně mapy se zastávkami abych věděl kam přeběhnout pokud se změní poloha nástupní zastávky dalšího spoje. Asi jediná věc chybí k dokonalosti a to podpora Apple Watch s možností zkontrolovat si aktuální trasu na hodinkách, zvláště v době rouškové a telefony s FaceID ;) | Bohužel rok od roku je více zastaralá. Chybí mi podpora tmavého režimu, widgetů, nebo nákup lístků přes Apple Pay. Škoda, že vývojáři spí má vavřínech. Funkčnost aplikace tzn. vyhledání spojů je nadále výborná. | The best app for searching travel connections I tried so far. And the support is helpful and quick | Spolehlivá aplikace použitelná i v offline režimu. Lze vyhledávat až na úroveň jednotlivých zastávek v rámci celé ČR. Zatím jsem nenarazil na místo, kde by existoval dopravní spoj neznámý této aplikaci. Považuji za lepší než IDOS apod. Používám již několik let. Rozhodně se vyplatí zaplatit celoroční aktualizaci !
Díky všem vývojářům i těm, kteří se starají o všechny nezbytné aktualizace dat.
Petar | Jste nejlepsi, protoze kdyz zadam nejakou adresu a nevim , jak se na to misto dostanu, take nechci složité hledat ma mape okolni zatavky MHD, vase app to s prehledem najde a nabidne zpusob jizdy )) | Maximální spokojenost s aplikací...dobré vyhledávání atd. | Velice dobra aplikace jako ridic autobusu jsem ji moc ocenil na linkach ktere jsem neznal akorat je skoda ze neslouzi i jako navigace ze se pri delsim nesledovani mapy vypne, kdyz uz mam zaplou polohu a zaplaceny licence tak at je alespon moje poloha vycentrovana a ne abych musel posouvat mapou jak neandrtalec proto pouze 3hvezdy | pouzivam jiz nekolik let a lepsi interaktivni jizdni rad jsem nenasel! | Easy, handy, accurate and cheap | Super aplikace | doporučuju! | Hi, awesome app, but, when i set reminder, sometimes it dissapear from the menu “notifications” after i close the app. Does anyone have similar problem or do you want more detail description? | I really like this app, using it every day. Even when the last update was a year ago, it's still good and worth the money for timetables. But it's a quite a while that we have dark mode. Can you imlement it please? 🤞🤞 | Po nějaké době jsem se vrátil k apce a chybí mi dark mode. Škoda | Naprosto skvělá aplikace na dopravu, je offline, sice placená, ale stojí to za to. | Mail? Nemáte aplikaci od Apple neodpovíte na chyby. Chcete uložit do Gmail adresáře? No kurva zapomeňte! Tahle aplikace je zlo! Stejně jako ignorance vývojářů. Nebrat!!!! | Nejlepší aplikace na vyhledávání spojení. Velký plus za design a funkčnost v offline režimu bez připojení k internetu. | It bothers you with notification about a week before your licence expires and if you buy before the original licence expires, you lose that time. | Jsem s aplikací mnoho let spokojen. | • The best “timetables” app. 
• The only thing missing is purchasing tickets + pay.

• Nejlepší aplikace typu “jízdní řády”.
• Jediná věc, která chybí je kupování jízdenek a pay. | Úžasná aplikace, používám již 3.rokem. | Chtělo by to widget a tam zobrazeny odjezdy z nejbližších zastávek. Jinak v pohodě appka. | Paradni offline aplikace, stahnete si data a pak muzete koukat kdekoliv a kdykoliv i na mapu :) | Vyskoušila jsem hodně aplikaci na MHD, vlaky a nikdy jsem s žádnou nebyla spokojena jako s touto apkou :)))) | Lidi za ty prachy nemohu na tuto aplikaci nemohu na tuto dopustit. Spolehlivé a rychlé vyhledání spojení. Co je nej? Offline vyhledávání. Třeba když jste v metru. | Nejlepší aplikace na jízdní řády. Používám několik let a vždy funguje na 100%. | Jsem spokojen, používáno i na jiné platformě a nikdy nebyl problém, pro cestování, ale i běžné denní ježdění zcela vyhovující a perfektní. Vřele doporučuji a vývojářům patří velký dík. | Velmi prakticka aplikace,casto ji pouzivam. Jen posledni dobu nefunguje ulozeni spoje vlaku fo kalendare v telefonu. Po ulozeni se v nem neobjevi. | Poplatek za licenci je naprosto v pohodě. Cestovat s tímhle pomocníkem je o mnoho snažší. | Skvělá rychlá a intuitivní aplikace s profesionálním a operabilním supportním týmem.

Doporučuji všemi deseti...

Petr Hudák | Umi snad skoro vse co si clovek preje, offline aktualizovane jizdni rady snad vseho co se hyba a mohl bych tim nekdy jet. 

Mozna by stalo zato pridat funkci autmented reality, kdy by vas aplikace navigovala k nejblizsi zastavce, nebo by vam ukazala ten spravny smer kterym mate jet. | Cely rok absolutne bez problemu, propracovane a aktualni a bez reklam. Kam se hrabe IDOS. | Perfektní a uživatelsky velmi příjemná aplikace.  Dlouholeté zkušenosti s Androidem i nyní s IPhone velmi dobré. RR. | Přehledná appka, čistý design. Akorát mám občas problém se stěhováním aktualizaci - vždycky to loví a pak napíše “Časový limit vypršel” a nezbyde než to zkusit za půl dne znova. | Promakaná appka, akorát mi chvíli trvalo naučit se s ní zacházet, obzvlášt s neintuitivním nákupem licence, kde appka bohužel nijak nekontroluje její duplicitní nákup (který jsem udělal z bezradnosti). Synchronizace přes iCloud je bezchybná, poloha vlaku, více otevřených spojů najednou, inteligentní historie hledání... Bravo!!! | Zatím jsem nic lepšího nenašel. Na to že to stojí pár korun na rok je to skvělá

   Last year I bought beautiful Q5 50 TDI 2020. 
  I am very confused by the fact that my application ( recently I have both) plug and play & my Audi…  
  I have spent €40 to make little control over very few options on luxury premium car. 
  To compare with  Lincoln Navigator  (wife) or even Volvo XC 90 -( my daughter ) … 
  It seems to me very poor coverage of many many extras I have in my car Audi…
   Please take more care about your recent offer of iPhone connection to “my Audi “application..
  It seems not very generous to pay €20 for very poor comparison to World leading SUV’s 
   Thank you very much, your Entusiates Vladimir Varhol | This is the only application in my iPhone which requires typing username and password after every turning on/off of the iPhone. Imagine doing this for every application in iPhone! It is absurd and make this app useless- I am not going to do this every day | Disappointed with the application for Audi RS7 last gen. actually, it can't do much... the other car companies are better with technology... where is the technical advance?????? | It takes longer to the car to react | The doesn’t always function as it should. The shop is impossible to use, failing even the most basic functions. Hot line availability is very limited. Very poor user experience. | Hello...aplication is very poor compare to e.g. Skoda app. I have a lot ideas how to improve. Feel free to ask me 😉. | Ještě horší app než u Škody. Mám zaregistrovaný mail a nejde se přihlásit. Pořád to píše nějakou chybu. Prostě za mne  šmejd! | The problem with this app is that it barely connects to my car. 
In half of the cases it doesnt even gets the latest status of the car or the car is not able to receive any command. Well, there is just one real function, the heating.
If the connection is successful, it always takes good 20 or 30 seconds to get ready. That means 20 seconds of waiting to switch the heating on. 20 seconds if you are lucky. In other cases I give up after one minute and try again. You dont really want to spend these minutes in the rush mornings.  
In unsuccessful cases it says “unknown error” or “not connected to the internet” (I am) or it just tries to connect to the car or do the task for a very long time. 
I like my brand new A6 but this app frustrates me so much. Such a disappointment!
After you fix this, also please add some more functions and I dont really mean a shop for bikes and scooters. | Velmi často se mi stává, že SW vykazuje “neznámou”chybu, auto nenačte, dálkově neodemkne atd. | Malé zlepšení přehlednosti by pomohlo. Také pod menu výbava by mohlo být více položek než jen VIN a barva vozidla . Zkratka by aplikace měla být více intuitivní .

Funguje dobře , ale mohla by být rychlejší při komunikaci s vozem. Nastavování nezávislého topení  pro 1 čas je nedostatečné . Doplnil bych spotřebu pro historické jízdy . | Nic moc apka do mob ! | The connection with my car is horrible via this app. The car availability is fifty fifty that car will not be reached. I am sad from this quality. | Audi should have better app than this. Škoda has way better app than audi. | The application looks nice and it’s simple to use. It would be great to include more features in! It’s very basic at this point! I was surprised when dealer offered me Bluetooth plug combined with other application to track trip data… This doesn’t feel right for a premium car manufactured in 2023. Please consider extending features of this application to not require a plug. | In general, the app doesn’t have much features, I’d expect much more (driving data, trips,…), especially from a premium brand.

All the car-related actions (lock, heating, …) take too long process.

As for the bugs, one of the latest is: supposedly, I cannot open a detail of a news (which is not in my language) due to no car in the app (of course it’s there). | Nefunguje odeslani  cile do auta do navigace | Hrozne, pomale, malo funkci, opravdova ostuda, meli by se ucit od Muska. | I’m not able to select another language in the app. The language is set depending on your residence country but it’s confusing if you are not native speaker. | Hey Audi, I think you can imagine that there are a lot of foreigners living in Czechia don't know Czech! Please give a choise of language in the app🙏🏼 Even only English will be perfect. | I enjoy the app, but will welcome more statistics about my routes. 
Great will be some alerts like when the car stays on one place for longer time and is not locked, or windows are opened.

I don’t know why after last but one update was disabled the possibility to run frequent actions directly by pushing on the icon of the app | Very slow app with many bugs like can’t load data etc. bad user experience:( | It just says that it is not possible to update vehicle status (eTron 2019).

Can’t view the baterry info, can’t start A/C, can’t do anything.

Can’t understand, why even basic test cannot be performed before the app goes live. | V nové verzi 4.13.0 přestala fungovat veškerá komunikace s vozidlem Q4. Aplikace hlásí, že nemůže spojit se serverem. Nepomohla ani reinstalace. Předchozí verze fungovala. | App 90% off time doesn’t work, even worse with each update. Now about one year of Q4 Etron owning I really hate Audi! What the support do?! | Cíle odeslané z aplikace se ve vozidle nezobrazují. | Doesn't Wok | Update of the data in the app takes ages and nit accurate (i still got low oil warning no matter that it is ok). But you cant see nothing more than mileage and % of fuel in the tank. I would expect something like Audi connect plug and play - history of drives, fuel economy, effectiveness etc.. This is not “vorsprung durch technika”… | Aplikace dobrá, bohužel nelze dokupovat výbavu přes My Audi. | Repeatedly falling down, disconnecting and connecting again. Unreliable. | First, the app can’t do too many things on my Audi A3 2020. I can only check whether my car is locked and how much fuel I have.

When I try to send a location to the car’s navigation, it takes eternity to actually fetch it in the car. I send it on my way to the car and receive it after like 10 Km of drive. Sometimes I receive it the next day… stupidest thing to send it over some Audi servers, when it can be sent via Bluetooth. But I know you want know everything about your customers.

Second thing is the annoying launch whenever I sit in the car. Can’t turn it off anywhere.. Just searching something on my phone and that damn app pops up in my face. Never seen that BS in any other app.

The only useful thing that keeps me from uninstalling is that I can check whether I locked my car if I’m not sure. Otherwise completely useless in my A3. You should start thinking about the users, not just yourself how to collect information about us. | Šíleně pomalé načítání, minimum užitečných funkcí, design .. | Proč firma jako AUDI neumí udělat funkční Aplikaci? Auta za milióny a apka k ničemu. Věčně nefunkční. | Aplikace je úplně k ničemu. Inzerované funkce vzdáleného ovládání vůbec nefungují ani po dvou letech update aplikace. Dnes se nedá přihlásit na servery myAudi, jak z aplikace tak už i z webu. Za rok to zase zkusím. Pokud bych viděl něco opravdu špatného na audi, tak je to tato aplikace a přístup audi to nějak řešit. | The app it self doesn’t show all functions as they are shown on the web page of my Audi…!!! Why??? Hey Audi wake up and look at Mercedes or BMW!!!!  I own and S7 Audi 2017… | Cannot register my car even after multiple discussions with support. | Unfortunately, this application is not good.
I don't understand if Audi have not the money to pay good programmers, but this app was done by a bunch of amateurs from school.
To clarify the problem, I will also write the car I have - the Audi Q7 E-tron
1) communication of the application with the car sometimes works, sometimes not. I didn't figure out where the problem was.
2) when I want to turn on the independent heating, the application sometimes responds for more than 1 minute, but sometimes it starts and sometimes it doesn't. I just point out that there is a SIM with enought data lmit in the car and the car is usually fully charged.
3) Unlocking / locking the car takes at least 10 seconds.
4) Restoring the condition of the car in App takes at least 10 seconds, sometimes 50 seconds!
 
I don't understand why such a company like Audi is not able to make an application that works without problems.

Hope it will be better in next version... | my car is very often unavailable, the data cannot be loaded and therefore, for example, independent heating cannot be switched on in winter. you can't mean that | Čím dal horší. | It seems that Audi is trying to make this app even worse with every new release. Huge connectivity issues. Nothing work as expected. I would like to give you minus one star but it is not possible unfortunately. | Často nefunguje nebo velká prodleva | This app is just ""A Try"" to be Smart. Good start for old fashioned car maker but poor for 21st century. No charging stats. Option to create trip tracking means to fill all by hand like in excel without using data from the car. Complicates interface. I like Audi, so hoping to make progress in IT soon. Two stars for e-tron itself :-)). | Tato aplikace je uplne k nicemu. Nic vlastne neumi a ani nenabizi, tahle appka ani v realu neodpovida screen-shotu v ramci teto nabidky v app storu. Jedine co vam to ukaze je, jak vase auto vypada na dokonale fotce. Jsem zklamany z celeho audi stylu ... | Audi A6 BJ 2020, in der App keine Anzeige von Füllstand, Fahrzeugzustand, u.ä.. | Shame. Shame. Shame. Somebody from Audi importer made a huge fail. Skoda or Volkswagen are online on app. Buying a Q7 was a obvious mistake. The seller even do not warn your that the Audi has not license for tele-services in CZE. I am going to sell it very quickly. The rumors says the services will be online in 2nd half of 2020 but it might happen that online sevices might be only for new models... | Hi guys. I could not event register in the app. This is a shame. | Well, Audi is a fine car maker, but that is probably all for now. 21st century is something they apparently try to ignore, because their approach towards ensuring reliability of this app may not be described by words admissible to these reviews. But this
might be too harsh rating for the app itself, since the problems are rather on the IT infrastructure of “connected” services. Is it normal that servers often crash just before weekend, so that comfortably resting Audi IT crowd does not make any remedy until Monday? Still glad that car goes without being connected to internet, but nothing more - navigation targets, remote control etc. is just nonexistent... would anybody use e-mail client if emails just stopped regularly  going in and out for two days? 
Two stars for the cars. | Koupil jsem AUDI A6 allroad v DRESDEN , ale ani to není záruka funkční aplikace. Absolutně se do ni nedá přihlásit a komunikace s autem je takřka nemožná . | Sorry guys, it’s 2019.. I paid almost 3 mil for Q8 and App myAudi is one of biggest disappointment in my life. The better aplication get owner of Skoda Kodiac. | Tak jak byla špatná aplikace audi connect tak ještě horší je myAudi. Důvod je to, ze z aplikace zmizelo i to málo co bylo v audi connect. I přes to ze v náhledu aplikace je vidět možnost ovládání auta tak to ve skutečnosti v ČR nefunguje což je u auta z roku 2017 za bezmála 3mil. velmi smutné.

DETAILED INFORMATION FOR YOUR PLANNING
For each hike, trail, or trip you will find all the key information:
• Basic parameters of the trail, such as length, average duration of the hike, highest point of the trail, elevation, difficulty, type of hike, whether it is possible to camp in the area, and if the hike is suitable for dogs.
• Accommodations in the vicinity of the route that are possible to book.
• A detailed map that will show you, in addition to the trail itself, where you may find water sources in your vicinity, shelters for sleeping, or suitable places for camping and also attractions that you may come across during the hike.
• A detailed but engaging description of the hiking trail, which will help you always find your way around.
• Necessary equipment - if there is any equipment needed to finish the trail, you will know about it!
• Possible dangers - we want you to be able to prepare for anything.
• Weather forecast and daylight info - find out what the weather will be like on the day of your trip.

Za me 5/5 | Aplikace mě uchvátila hned po prvním spuštění, je nádherně zpracovaná, přehledná a obsahuje nespočet výletů. Strašně se mi líbí, že v aplikaci najdu všechno, co bych před túrou ráda věděla, například vím, jak dlouho přibližně trasa bude trvat, zda mohu po cestě kempovat či jestli je trasa dog friendly. V aplikaci je možno najít také možnosti ubytování v okolí trasy, což je za mě také velké + a pokud chcete opravdu někam vyrazit, máte to téměř bez práce s touto aplikací. 
Velké díky a klobouk dolů. | Výborná aplikace na výlety. Hezky zpracované a popisy také sedí. Doporučuji. | Nápad skvělý ale provedení příšerný. Aplikace se mi během túry někdy sama vypíná a nebo mě dokonce odhlásí ( i když mám zaškrtnuté pamatovat si mě, nikdy tam nemám svůj účet s musím vše vyplňovat znova). Když už se mi podaří zdolat túru bez problému, po uložení a dokončení trasy a vyzvednutí xp se mi pak aplikace snaží říct ze vlastně jsem žádnou túru neudělala, i když mi predtim napsala ze ji mám uloženou, tak najednou není. Docela zklamání 😔 | Aplikaci jsem využil ale chybí mi tam par věci.Hlavně bych přivítal kdyby tam šlo nahrát již absolvované trasy třeba s Garminu nebo jiné zaznamenané aplikace. Přeci jen člověk využívá i jiné chytré hodinky. A taky naštve když vám aplikace v polovině trasy vypne a vám pak zmizí záznam. | Nejlepší aplikace pro ty, co rádi chodí! Každý si najde své. Treky méně náročné, více náročné, výšlapy, okruhy,… Každý trek krásně popsaný, doložené fotografie a spousta užitečných informací. | Super aplikace, hlavně pro hikery. Akorát podrobnější info je za placenou verzi. Jinak super | ♥️
V případě problému, super rychla komunikace s vývojáři apky :)
Výletů plno a popsané do detailů. | Zatím super, jen by to chtělo více výletů v mém okolí. | If you hike, you don’t need anything else. Great platform and social network. | I wanted to use it after a while and the app is not working. So safe your money for membership etc and download ALLTRAILS :) see you on hikes | Kopie jiných apps, ne příliš user friendly. Malá databáze a srandovní překlad do angličtiny (defaultně nastavená na mém iP). Prostě zbytečná appka, které rádoby cool reklamky na sockách nepomůžou k větší popularitě… | Super aplikace, která jako všechny má nějaký ten nešvar, ale vše hned umí obratně vyřešit! A to se cenní. Navíc má spoustu super treků, které ti určitě nedojdou. Zejména u zahraničních výšlapů, máš super popis, který se hodí, když nejsi zrovna “jazykově” nadaný. Alespoň nezabloudíš. | Byla by to super appka, kdyby se neustále sama od sebe nevypínala | Skvělá aplikace. Dobrý popis cest. Skvělý je při rozcestí natočení telefonu na stranu a hned vím kam mám jít. | Skvělá inspirace 👍 | Skvela aplikace, ktera mi pomaha na kazdem kroku v prirode. Jen tak dal! :) | Skvělá aplikace, díky které jsme si naplánovali výlet bez jakýchkoliv problémů. V této aplikaci máte vše na jednom místě včetně vyznačených pítek. 💧Velice tuto aplikaci doporučuji pro všechny horaly. | It’s very user friendly! And so helpful if you are starting as a hiker… also so nice to finally find an app in czech with treks with the instructions in English :D | Skvělá aplikace s užitečnými informacemi pro dobrodružství. Ať už větší nebo menší. Díky ní jsem odhalila i spoustu hezkých míst, které máme kousek. | Appka vhodná jak pro zkušené hikery tak i pro začátečníky. Nemáš orientační smysl nebo si jenom nejsi jistý, podle čeho vybrat zajímavou trasu? Tak to je tahle appka ideálním řešením 😊 | Aplikace je skvělá pro dobrodruhy všech kategorií. Skvěle se hodí pro hledání vhodné trasy a získání všech důležitých informací, které k cestě potřebujete👍🏻 | Great app for discover new opportunities for hiking or some adventure! You can find there from easier hikes to difficulr climbing adventure! | Nelze hledat trasy, pokud nejsem přímo na místě | Zatím nezklamala 😍 | Na 100% ji využiji při svých oblíbených aktivitách | Perfektní appka na hiky a treky | Mnoho treků, které přibývají každý týden s detailním popisem a informacemi. Nádherný design. Skvělá komunita okolo aplikace - doporučuji zkouknout i úžasné rozhovory na jejich instagramu moderované příjemnou slečnou nebo překrásným fousatým moderátorem. | Nejlepsi aplikace na kterou jsem narazila. Naprosto spokejenost. 🤩 | This app is awesome choice for people who like to travel (especially hiking). You can find usefull built-in fetures, such as water sources and camping spots on the track or any equipment you need to succesfully complete every route. | Úplně perfekt aplikace hele. Zatím jsem nenašel žádnou nedokonalost. Vývojářský tým odvedl skvělou práci. Díky adventurerovi je pro mne procházka do lesa nevídané dobrodružství. | Naprostej top!!! Přesně to, co jsem hledala! 🤍 | Pri registrácii nie je možné v hesle použiť iné znaky ako písmená a číslice, bez registrácie sa do aplikácie nedostanem, takže ju inak neviem ohodnotiť. | Jen mě udivuje, že je někdo ochoten platit tak vysoké částky za členství a ještě ke všemu měsíčně.🥵  Vím že nic není zdarma, ale .....  
Držím pěsti s vývojem.  Dark mode by bodl. | Zdravim, hned po registraci mi appka spadne, 3x jsem zkusila a vzdy mi spadla..co s tim? | S přítelkyní jsme využili appku tento víkend a naprostá spokojenost. Zajímalo nás, zda bude appka opravdu správně merit nás trek, tak jsme ještě mimo to měřili přes garmin. Vše sedělo (čas, délku, trasu). 

Navíc design naprosto v TOPU! 😍(a to jsem si ještě před par lety vůbec nedokázal představit, ze budu nějakou podobnou aplikaci využívat). | Tahle aplikace je nejvíc, tolik výletů na jednom místě. 😍 | Konečně něco propracovaného na cesty!🤩🙏🏼 Doporučuji všema deseti. | Na appku jsem se hrozně těšila kvůli mapě blízkých tracků s podrobnými informacemi a fotkami. A to taky obsahuje. Jsem hrozně ráda, že tu něco takového je a že se podle toho dá i rozumně plánovat. Ráda objevuji nové traily. Dost oceňuji i reálné hodnocení obtížnosti tracku, které konečně obtížnost tras nenadhodnocuje, jako tomu je u jiných poskytovatelů. Je to zkrátka dělaný především pro relativně fit lidi. Za mě palce nahoru. | Nejlepší aplikace na cestování. | Moc se mi líbí přehledný a hezky zpracovány design. Ukáže vám i jaké túry máte v okolí, což je za mě super, protože nemusíte vyhledávat zdlouhavě na internetu, kam se tedy v okolí vydat + tam k tomu máte všechny potřebné informace, jako např. jak obtížná trasa je, co s sebou či předpověď počasí.

Problém by možná šel reprodukovat takto:
1. Připojte se na data i wifi
2. Zvolte nákup jízdenky
3. V průběhu platby vypněte wifi
4. Platba by měla skončit neúspěchem, ale na straně banky by měla proběhnout

Vše bez problémů, s doplněním funkce Apple Pay bude nákup ještě snazší. Vlastní aplikace je podle mě mnohem lepší řešení než obskurní Sejf. | Chybí platební tlačítko “Pay with Pay”. | Když pominu, že je možné koupit jen 2 typy jízdenek, což mi na většinu cestování po Olomouci stačí, tak je tu problém s placením.
Lze platit pouze kartou (nikoliv přes Apple Pay) což je značně nepohodlné. Buď dám zapamatovat platební údaje, nebo budu muset při každé platbě zadávat kartu znovu. Přesně pro toto funguje Apple Pay, dam kartu jedné společnosti, která je pro mě důvěryhodná a pak platím vše přes tuto společnost a nezadávám citlivé informace do každé aplikace, nebo jiné webové služby.

[+] BLACK AND WHITE MODE
Capture stunning photos in classic black and white style! Now you can switch on the black and white live preview in the viewfinder to master exposure and achieve perfect contrasts for your monochrome shots (second page of control panel). Enjoy a 100% non-destructive workflow, giving you the freedom to revert to color or customize the black and white conversion at any time.

[+] TRUE HDR
Now you can effortlessly export your gain-map HDR photos as ISO-HDR photos in ProCamera’s Editing Studio (10-bit HEIC and 16-bit TIFF formats available). Although gain-map HDR is best for compatibility, HDR information can be lost when sharing. That’s where ISO-HDR photos come in handy, as they maintain the high dynamic range on all HDR-capable displays.

[+] HDR PHOTOS AS VIDEO CLIPS
Ever want to seamlessly incorporate HDR photos into your video projects? We understand the frustration when video editing programs fall short. ProCamera comes to the rescue with the ability to export your HDR photos as HDR 10-bit video clips. Easily integrate these clips into any video project, ensuring your visuals shine with brilliance. This feature is exclusively included in the ProCamera Up feature bundle. Simply open your HDR photo in our Studio, tap and hold the save button, and select this game-changing option. Dive deeper into this feature on our blog.

[+] FOCUS PEAKING 2.0
Precision meets efficiency with our revamped Focus Peaking for spot-on manual focus! What’s more, we’ve drastically optimized battery usage and the Focus Loupe has received enhancements for greater accuracy.
And for all ProCamera Up users, we’re excited to introduce an exclusive upgrade – the innovative Dual Color peaking feature. It’s designed to guide you more intuitively towards achieving the perfect focus setting, adding another layer of precision to your photography toolkit.

+++ 17.1:

[+] LOG PROFILE PRORES RECORDING
Elevate your videography with Apple ProRes recordings in Log profile on iPhone 15 Pro (Max). Enable it in ProCamera Settings: Video Quality > Advanced Settings.  

[+] RECORDING TO EXTERNAL USB-C DRIVE
Use the USB-C port on the new iPhones to record videos (ProRes, HEVC, H.264) directly to an external storage device.

[+] ACTION BUTTON SHORTCUTS
ProCamera now provides ready-made shortcuts to launch ProCamera in Photo/Video/Selfie mode with the new action button. When ProCamera is already open in this mode, you can press the action button to capture.

[+] LATEST IMPROVEMENTS
Optimizations for the new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro generation, as well as improved handling of anamorphic desqueeze in ProCamera’s album.

Mám pocit že standartní fotoaparát který je v iPhonu už nainstalovaný fotí lepe. vůbec tam nejde dát 10 s nebo 20 s dlouhý čas. nikde nemůžu najít nějaký vysvětlivky co na co slouží | Líbí se mi stálé vylepšení appky | OK, bud can't pay “up”. | Thank you for this amazing app! | Fajn appka, líbí se mi třeba možnost srovnání linií už při expozici, na druhou stranu LowLight+ nic moc, nativní Fotoaparát dává při automatické několikasekundové expozici mnohem lepší výsledky. Používám iPhone 13 Pro a 13 mini. | Výborná aplikace, jeste dodělat slow motion a timelaps a bude to dokonale!! | Zkoušel jsem i jiné apky.Tato mi vyhovuje nejvíc . Chtělo by to Český jazyk. | The “capture quality” setting really have no effect on the final image, so it is not possible to get a photo with a more natural look as advertised here. I have taken a many series of photos for comparsion, but even after close zooming there is no difference between Highly detailed and Natural settings. In a direct comparison of photos with the native Apple app, even the ProCamera photos are a bit more contrasty, which is exactly what I didn't expect from the app.
In addition the app is unstable, crashes or shows a black screen instead of life view. | Nefunguje mi hey siri udělej fotku | Za mne velmi spatne, kvalita rawu horsi nez od iphonu…zklamani | Not usable for CRT video recording for retrogaming. Manual shutter focus lock gets reset to auto when switching lens between 0.5 and 1.0x. Then when switching from 30fps 4k to 60fps 4k, you cannot set shutter speed even as 1/60? Only 1/61 is the minimum. Unable to sync with 50hz and 60hz monitor refresh rate. | The app doesn’t function after update to iOS 16. It felt after every start | It can't focus on nearby objects like the native app. Not even in manual mode. Overall, it focuses slowly. | 👍 | Thank you a lot for the only one long lasting disadvantage of the ProCamera app - now solved in the last update - an auto reset of set time or ISO in SI mode when entering a preview of taken picture. Now the app is perfect! Great job 👏 | Ještě bych přidal podporu gimbalů a je dokonalá. | Po poslední aktualizaci nejde změnit ikona aplikace na ploše v nastavení. Je to sice prkotina, ale u placené aplikace by to asi mělo vše fungovat. IPhone 12 Pro Max.
Edit: Teď po opravě je to už za pět! Parádní appka.👍 | Proč je na sílu změněna ikona aplikace a ve výběru nelze provést záměnu za původní? Tak jak jsem byl zvyklý? Že by směr Apple? Jedině vývojář ví nejlépe, co já vlastně chci? Jinak dobrá aplikace!🤨 | ..a nejde mi dát zpět ta na kterou jsem zvyklý 😩 | Jak aktivovat noční režim v aplikaci na iPhonu 12? | Za mne spokojenost. | Po dnešní aktualizaci funguje perfektně. Díky | Zatím nejlepší, co jsem pro iPhone vyzkoušel.
Můžete si nastavit mnoho funkcí, které jinde nenajdete. | There is so much great functionality! But it is more important that one can use it easily. | peki15 | 👍👍👍 | Zajímavé , vyzkousim | Today I tried the selfie mode for the first time, and I got a bright green screen. It is in the app, because the default camera of the phone works. Could you fix it, please? | Skvělá a spolehlivá aplikace pro toho, kdo to s focením myslí, alespoň trošku vážně. | Jako aplikace na focení je velice dobrá, obvzlášť když se zapne HDR.
Má několik skvělých funkcí např. focení ve tmě.
Celkově je aplikace velmí dobře udělaná | that I am surprised that Apple hasn’t bought them long time ago :-))

It is unbelievable what quality pics it can produce in very low-light conditions. And in any conditions ;-) | ... | I like it | Good application, it does what I expected. I decided to use this because of iPhone missing aspect 16:9. There are number of paid features which I bought and never really used. Still missing live photos but this seems to be unique to Apple camera only | HDR a zejména noční režim jsou perfektní. Doporučuji. | Perfektní | I love you camera | Velká spokojenost | Hello,

There is some kind of change? The camera is not working on fullscreen anymore? I dont like the Black frame around... Is it possible to enable it?

Thanks | Vyuzijte vsech moznosti vaseho ifoto :-) | The results are rather disappointing. The app is very slow and buggy at times, on my iPhone XS. The lowlight is far from good and I can’t tell the difference between the plus and not plus. Procam achieves way better results in low light. | It works in the same way as semi-automatic mode on iPhone 7. 
Maybe a bug of some of the last versions?
It worked some time ago. | I dont think it is fair bussiness to charge for full version of app and after first launch to realize that those features I bought this app for costs another extra money. Shame on you... | The focus is changing once its locked. Can you plesase fix? Once I make video and lock the focus with movement the focus is lost. Thx | After updating to 11.4 is unable to change photo mode, change button disappeared. Still have selected LowLight Plus... How can I change it, please?
Edit - thank you so much for your help! Now it’s fine and 5 stars rating is back. Best camera app again :) | It was a really good app few years back, I loved especially hdr filters (for extra money). But last few monts all the hdr filters except Normal don't work and they have not repaired that till now!

We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.

inDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. 
 
But now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.

The main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. 

What We Offer
CITY RIDES
Affordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.

INTERCITY RIDES
A safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. 

COURIER SERVICES
This door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.

FREIGHT SERVICES
Book a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
From home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.

Why choose inDrive
QUICK AND EASY
It's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points ""A"" and ""B"" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.

OFFER YOUR FARE
inDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.

CHOOSE YOUR DRIVER
inDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.

STAY SAFE
See the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the ""Share Your Ride"" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.

ADD TRAVEL OPTIONS
Do you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like ""traveling with my pet,"" “I have luggage,"" etc.

SIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY
If you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.
Best of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!

We can't wait for you to experience it.

582247244,"dk.1415.mobilperiodekort","DOT Billetter","https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/dot-billetter/id582247244?uo=4","DOT Tickets app is developed and owned by Din Offentlige Transport (DOT). DOT is a partnership between the traffic companies DSB, Movia and Metroselskabet to help create a better and more cohesive public transport system on Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Møn.
DOT Tickets app makes it easy to buy tickets and monthly passes for journeys on Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Møn. 
You can purchase tickets by entering your place of departure and arrival, either in the form of a stop, address, or place. You can also pick the zones you wish to travel from and to on the map. The 2-8 zones fast purchase is relevant for you, if you know how many zones you need from where you are. You can use that feature, if you give the app your permission to localization (GPS) so that the app can determine your start zone. Giving your permission to localization, which is voluntary, can also help you determine your location on the map versus your ticket's validity area.
Monthly passes can be purchased by entering your place of departure and arrival. You can also pick the zones manually on the map if you travel between 2 and 8 zones.
You can purchase these tickets in DOT Tickets app:
• Zone tickets for 2-8 zones
• Tickets for 9+ zones between a departure and arrival zone
• Commuter cards with Metro and DSB 1’ Regional Train as an optional add-on
• Commute20 with Metro and DSB 1’ Regional Train as an optional add-on
• Bicycle Metro
• Supplementary Ticket for Commuter Card (1 zone)
• DSB 1’ Regional Train supplementary ticket
• City Pass Small for zones 1-4 (24, 48, 72, 96 or 120 hours)
• City Pass Large for zones 1-99 (24, 48, 72, 96 or 120 hours)
• City Pass X-Large for zones 1-299 (24 hours)
• City Pass West for zones 101-199 (24 hours)
• City Pass South for zones 201-299 (24 hours)
• Event ticket Small for zones 1-4 (12 hours) and Event ticket Large for zones 1-99 (12 hours), available for limited periods in connection with events
• 12-hour ticket East, West and South for free traveling on Saturdays and Sundays for a limited period (December 2023 – February 2024)

• Company travel Pass


Payment in DOT Tickets app
You can pay with MobilePay or payment cards in DOT Tickets app. You can save your payment card details and access them via Touch ID, Face ID or a PIN code of your choice. In that way, you do not have to enter all card details every time you make a purchase.

Your payment card details are stored with Billwerk+.

The following payment cards are accepted:

• Visa/Dankort
• MasterCard
• Visa
• Visa Electron
• Maestro


NOTE:
Remember to buy your ticket before you start your journey.

Departure boards

You can create personal departure boards for your preferred transportation for all stations and stops on Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Møn filtered by the lines you want to follow.

On your departure board, you can see if there are delays or cancellations	.

When you create a departure board, you can get notifications about planned changes and you can add the board as a widget on your smartphone's home screen, so you always have it close at hand.

- Fixed the issue where DSB first class add-on for commuter cards were not available if the zones were selected manually.
- Fixed the issue with departure boards for Metro stations repeating the same departure.

Look like some kind of error when trying to list mobile operators suppored for Serbia
Shows only error.
Why is that? | Installed and setup at home, all seems OK. When arrived to destination it does not works just looking for network. Because of no Wi-Fi and no roaming so has no chance to check with help. | Dear Yesim creators team, 

First of all, I would like to thank you for this application, because during my long business trip in Turkey, I had only one issue and it was solved very quickly.

However, I am very disappointed with price policy and new conditions, and most likely I will not gonna use this application again. The reason is €15 for 10GB for 30 days was very great deal, but unfortunately new prices €18 is still okay, however only 14 days of time limit of package it’s very very bad.
I don’t care if Bryce will slightly grow up, but I care if time limitation of package escape for a 50%.
I am try to find another eSIM application, even I really liked yesim. However, the other applications offering better policy and longer time of using of data, one month should be a minimum.
Try to change conditions for one month for all of your packages, and you will have a huge number of customers.
Thank you | This app is very easy and good but it doesn’t got 5g connection… | Whoever wrote about good prices did not do their research. You can easily find esim plans 30-50 percent cheaper online. I was shocked at the prices and deleted the app. | It is quite easy to choose the tariff and after a few times you can pretty easily figure out yourself how to setup the new Yesim plan. Support is super nice and fast. They always help when you are stuck! I am not talking about their flexibility and willingness to make you satisfied. Pricing is also the best! Only Yesim! | Best app | ….. | Service is OK. Mostly works good. Support is always helpful. Will be better to have another internet before first start (public internet, etc.) | Very bad app. The data worked the first time but I could only buy and the data was only 3G and it didn't work on the iPhone, the data was dropping but it still showed I had no connection. I had high hopes for the app but then I was very disappointed. Reinstalling didn't help of course, I tried everything. | Opravdu užitečné pro mě Mám tuto aplikaci moc rád Najdu nejrychlejší internetovou službu bez simu, anoim je velmi vynikající aplikace pro online data | This app is overpriced. 40€ for 3 Gb plan in Indonesia? You can buy 9 Gb in there for about 10€. Do not even download. Waste of time. | The app looks like xxxx and their “cheap” plan asks for €16 for 3GB.

Simply unlock an e-bike or e-scooter in the Dott app, ride to your destination, and get on with your day – easy as that. 
To get started:
1. Download the Dott app
2. Check the in-app map to find a nearby e-scooter or e-bike
3. Scan the vehicle’s QR code to unlock it, and you’re off!
Pro tip: Grab a Dott pass to save on your ride. Or simply pay as you go with your secure payment method of choice.


Why choose Dott?
Dott is the simplest way to move around your city, safely and efficiently. Ditch the crowded commute and enjoy traveling in the open air. Avoid traffic jams and arrive at your destination on time – for a fraction of the cost of a taxi or car share.
Our e-scooters and e-bikes are available 24/7, making moving around your city a breeze! They’re brought in for regular maintenance and boast all the latest safety features. Plus, thanks to the smooth electric acceleration, riding our vehicles is a piece of cake.

Ride a Dott whenever you're:
* Meeting a friend for dinner
* Commuting to work
* Heading to class
* Going on a date
* Exploring your city on your day off, or sightseeing in other countries


Get around without breaking the bank
Simply pay for your rides as you go, at a price similar to public transport. Or, explore Dott passes to ride more for less: grab a pass for 24 hours, a week, or even a month to save on every ride. If you fancy a ride for free, just refer a friend and you’ll both get a free ride each! Want in on even more discounts? Turn on notifications to hear about our limited-time deals.

Where you’ll find us
Dott is currently available in 40 cities across Israel and Europe – with more on the way! Want to see Dott in your city?

Learning a new language has never been easier than with the new Rosetta Stone. The award-winning language solution combines proven learning methods with its proprietary speech recognition technology. Rosetta Stone is different because it works.

“Rosetta Stone is the gold standard when it comes to learning a new language.” - Mashable

“With its excellent user interface, clear instructions, a wide variety of games and challenges... Rosetta Stone has got it going on.” - TechCrunch

► LEARN INTUITIVELY THROUGH IMMERSION
Learn using our proven immersion method. Rosetta Stone carefully crafts sequences of words and images, so you can intuitively derive the meaning of each new phrase, without translations. The lessons recreate real-life scenarios, immersing you in the kind of situations you will encounter on holiday, at work or speaking with family. 

► GET ACCESS TO 24 LANGUAGES
Choose from 24 languages: Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, English (American or British), Filipino (Tagalog), French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin American or Spain), Swedish, Turkish, or Vietnamese.

► 5-10 MINUTE BITE-SIZED LESSONS
Make progress one step at a time. Our bite-sized lessons fit into your busy day.

► PERFECT YOUR PRONUNCIATION
Start fine-tuning your pronunciation from the very first lesson with our patented TruAccent speech-recognition engine. You’ll be confident that you know what to say and how to say it.

► CUSTOM LEARNING PLANS
Maintain your focus with a personalised learning plan. You define your pace. Select a learning plan that matches your goals such as improving your communications at work, preparing for travel or speaking fluently with family and friends.

► OFFLINE MODE
Never miss a thing and continue learning even when you’re offline. Use Offline Mode to download units so you can complete them later, even offline.

This is a great feature that was sorely missing in earlier versions. 
But there are problems. 
Why, when I am on line does it take 30 second or more ' downloading required file' and do that every time I open the app? 
After it has done that, it resets the view to level 2 unit 2 lesson 3 core lesson! 
What is worse is it resets progress. I am on level 2 unit 8 lesson 4( which I downloaded. ) and I've had to repeated many sections a number of times. 
Also, when online in a downloaded lesson, it seems to re download the lesson data instead of using the downloaded data. I suspect this because if I'm sitting in a location with poor wifi it can take a minute or more to down load a single page.  Why is that if the lesson is downloaded? 
It's not all bad though. It now caches your login data so you don't have to click though two login pages every time you load the app. 
You still have to verify audio setting every time you launch the App. 
So Rosetta Stone. Please fix These annoying issues.

I wouldn't mind spending some money on the premium version, but an annual membership for more than 50€, that seems really pointless...

Vždy to trvá nejméně čtvrt hodiny a vždy když ji potřebuji. Dohady s revizory, kdy i se zakoupeným kuponem jsem za černého pasažéra jsou velmi příjemné, neboť neakceptují danou chybu v aplikaci ani s vystavenou fakturou přes email, kde je uvedena částka i platnost kuponu. Teď mi aplikace nenačítá kupony od soboty ráno a hle, nefunguje to až dosud kdy je neděle. Aktualizováno mám vše, ale k zakoupeným produktům se nedostanu. A opravdu odmítám být vyvedena z mhd jak černý pasažér, i přes zakoupenou službu a vyfasovat flastr jen kvůli vaší chybě! Hlavně, že došlo k zdražení služeb a po zakoupení mám prostě smůlu. Jako zákazník, který si vaši službu zakoupil bych tímhle procházet neměla. | Aplikace funguje dobře od koupi tarifu až po odbavení v MHD, ale má jeden zásadní Bug. Nemohla by se aplikace k účtu přihlašovat nad pozadí? Jednak by s tím neotravovala při každém spuštění a druhak se při tom zasekne při špatném připojení k internetu. Což pak znemožňuje přístup ke qr kódu a odbavení v autobuse. To fakt vymyslelo slušné jelito. | Bez připojení k internetu zcela nefunkční, ať už z důvodu absence dat, případně mizerného pokrytí mobilním signálem na českých drahách. Zakoupenou jízdenkou v aplikaci se tak v některých případech nemůžete prokázat. Aktualizace 08.01.2024: Bohužel jen plané sliby, aplikace v offline režimu stále nefunguje. Aktualizace 12.01.2023 To není úplně pravda. Pokud má aplikace přístup k internetu a máte výpadek v serverech, tak vyhodí chybu komunikace a po odkliknutí OK nic nezobrazí. V tom případě je řešení vypnout data, jenomže zákazníci nejsou vaši testeři a hádám, že to žádného z nich nenapadne. Nevidím důvod nezobrazit nejdřív jízdenky/předplatné, pak si zkoušet načítat/aktualizovat data. Dobří vývojáři mají u své aplikace přímý kontakt, ne odkaz na web, recenze není primární kontakt pro řešení chyb v aplikaci s vývojáři. | Aplikace funguje poměrně dobře, ale chybí propojení s Plzeňskou kartou, aby se mohl cestující prokázat pouze mobilní aplikací, když fyzickou kartu nebude mít zrovna u sebe. | Mám v aplikaci předplacenou zónu Plzeň. Když si koupím IDPK jízdenku z Plzně do Rokycan (14kč) přes Apple Pay, je vše v pořádku. Pokud si ale stejnou jízdenku následně koupím z oblíbených tak i přes to, že mi před placením ukazuje aplikace i Apple Pay 14 korun, strhne se z účtu 30 korun. Předpokládám, že pokud kupují jízdenku z oblíbených najednou se nebere v potaz to, že mám předplacenou zónu Plzeň.

Třešnička na dortu: formulář pro reklamaci na stránkách PMDP také nefunguje. A v aplikaci žádné místo pro nahlášení chyby není, nebo jsem ho nenašel. | Funguje, ale UX strašné. Nenabídne aktuální polohu, ani minulá hledání. Těžko věřit, že bych někdy řekl: ""Zlatá Lítačka nebo Můj vlak."" Ale je to tak. | Při nákupu jednotlivého jízdného v Plzni. Když se mi to stalo poprvé, myslel jsem, ze je to můj omyl. Naštěstí jsem včas zjistil a ve voze jsem koupil další jízdenku (shodou okolnosti zrovna přišel revizor, takže skoro pokuta). Od te doby si dávám extra pozor. Dnes jsem si při platbě přes Apple Pay opět zkontroloval, ze to ukazuje “odložena aktivace”, nicmene se jízdenka začala aktivovat okamzite. Stacil jsem včas stornovat. Tvůrcům appky: tohle je docela fail, už nemám duveru a kupuji si radši papírové jízdenky… | Programoval a funkce vymyslel imbecil … jinak koncept dobrej. Je možnost si koupit tokeny na “svoji bankovní kartu” a pak po vás chtějí normální jízdné, protože to nefunguje. A řidic neví, jak to má fungovat a chce cash. Uganda hadr🤣 | Ze zastávky Ke Kovářce nešlo koupit jízdenku. Občas i z jiných míst se načte spojení, ale bez možnosti koupit. | Na Androidu nejde otevrit zakoupene jizdenky, proto musim tahat s sebou iPhone!!! | Kartu je fantazie používat. Použití je velice intuitivní. Též ovládání hlasem. Spokojenost
Ivan | Po zakoupení jízdenky na 60 minut se mi jizdenka nezobrazila, nelze ji aktivovat. Aplikace po kliknutí na Zakoupené sama spadne. Připojení mám rychlé a stavilní na 4G. | Mel jsem zaplacene predplatne a stahnul jsem si aplikaci do jineho telefonu a tam jsem se prihlasil na ucet kde jsem predplatne mel a nic tam nebylo, takze me zastavil revizor | Po aktualizaci zmizela uložená platební karta. Ani při vyplnění platebních údajů však lístek nelze koupit. | Proběhla registrace, email, heslo potvrzeni registrace.
Poděkovaní za úspěšnou registraci 
Zadám přihlásit,NELZE!
Uživatelské jméno nebo heslo nejsou správné.
Docela průser hned na začátku, představa že mi to hodí podobný error v šalině a já se budu muset hádat s revizorem …
MAŽU! | Při pokusu o přihlášení dostávám chybovou hlášku: ""Chyba komunikace Pri komunikaci se serverem doslo k chybe. Opakujte akci pozdeji."" | Už po druhé se mi stalo, že jsem si koupil jízdné na měsíc, vše podle správného postupu, zaplatím, přijde faktura na mail, ale nenačte se časový kupon s QR kódem v aplikaci.. kvůli tomu mám problém s revizory (holt pokaždé budu chodit na pobočku s lístkem na pokutu, že to zaplacené mám, mně je to jedno). Nehodlám to jinak řešit, když je chyba na Vaší straně. | Aplikace má plnit jednoduchou funkci a to tedy nákup lístků a předplatného na MDH. Bohužel tuto funkci neplní, zakoupíte si službu a nic. Nechte si lístek poslat Českou poštou, u ní aspoň dopředu víte, že vám nic nepřijde. | Amatérsky vypadající aplikace, která ani nepodporuje Apple Watch. Přitom vývojářské nástroje od Applu umožňují vcelku bezproblémovou realizaci takového řešení. Navíc se již v ČR dají koupit AW s LTE, tudíž nepodporovat tak základní věc, jako je možnost mít předplatné jízdné v AW, považuji za velkou ostudu. | Konečně funkční Apple Pay! Díky za appku | Appikace vypada strasne, design vubec nezapada do ostatnich aplikaci. Aplikace nepodporuje ApplePay a pri pokusu o nakup otevre platebni branu primo v Safari a predchazi tomu varovani a aplikaci jsem radsi nepouzil pro nakup. Pouzita platebni brana CSOB take nepodporuje ApplePay. | Ta aplikace byla naprosto skvělá. Až do té aktualizace, od té chvíle stojí za starou belu. Pomalé odezvy, padá, i při odložené aktivaci musím čekat, než naskočí platnost. Nelze jednoduše koupit jízdenku s tím, že teď koupím, teď platí - složitě musím přes jízdní řády a nedejbože, když se potřebuju dostat odněkud z Plzně do Stoda. Motá se mi do toho jízdní řád MHD, takže prostě nemůžu jednoduše navolit, odkdy chci, aby začala platit. Váže mi to na tramvaj, kterou podle něj mám využít - co na tom, že já chci jet už dřív. Rozvrtali jste to, co fungovalo. Jízdenku pro psa už evidentně taky nekoupím. 
Je to nepoužitelné, když se v tom nechci vrtat 5 minut a nastavovat, jakou jízdenku chci. Což opravdu nechci, když mi za minutu jede tramvaj, dobíham na zastávku a potřebuju rychle koupit a zaktivovat jízdenku. Prosím vyřešte to. Pak rád opravím hodnocení, do té doby je to aplikace na smazání. | Aplikace je funkční a zhruba dělá to, co má – nákup lístků funguje a chválím za podporu Apple Pay, která je super. Z uživatelského hlediska (UX/UI) je to ale dost velká tragédie. Prosím, přidejte alespoň možnost “Zapamatovat si” v dialogu při potvrzení nákupu lístku. | It was not possible to purchase ticket via Apple pay. After the message paymet made, the transaction did not take place. | Aplikace jako celek funguje velice dobře, ale velice mi chybí možnost zakoupit jízdenku pro psa. Tím pádem pro mě ve velkém ztrácí smysl. | Nejnepoužitelnější aplikace jakou jsem kdy viděl. Ani po hodině se nepřihlásím natož abych se dostal dál. Aplikace jde pryč a vývojáři by měli jít taky, jestli to někdo čte a za něco vás platí. | Kdy už bude konečně podpora Apple Watch? Chci cestovat jen s hodinkami a tahle appka mě v tom omezuje. | Mám datový tarif u cizího mobilního operátora a aplikace se přes něj nedokáže připojit na server a hlásí chybu komunikace, server je nedostupný. Pokud se připojím přes wi-fi, tak je vše vpořádku, přes mobilní data to však nelze i přesto, že data mi normálně fungují. | Pokud máte nový telefon, jak přesunete roční jízdenku? Uživatelský úplně nepřehledné, složité! Jízdenka není spřažená s uživatelem! ZOO jako jediná možnost vlezného v celé Plzni? LoL 🤬🤬 | Pro koupi jednotlivého jízdného vyžaduje registraci. Zbytečná aplikace, stačí SMS jízdenka. | V aplikácii chyba možnosť resetovať heslo, v e-shope po zadaní kódu, ktory si radšej uchovajte pri registrácii… reset neprebehne. 

Ak sa konečne dostanete k nákupu časového kupónu, v aplikácii sa nezobrazí ( prešla pol hodina a nič) 

Velmi slabé spracovanie v porovnaní z Prahou či Bratislavou… som nanajvýš sklamaný. | Nenabízí vstupenky jako na místě. Například nejde zakoupit kombinovaná vstupenka pro zoo a dinopark. | Aplikace dobra, ze nemusim tisknout listky. | Pozor při nákupu lístku před nástupem do MHD. !Aplikace hází chybu při první platbě a po opakování vám vygeneruje lístek až z 2 minutovým odstupem od času nástupu, takže je v případě kontroly neplatný | Vypada go na do rou appku, ale u vstupenky do zoo nevidim platnost kuponu. Clovek kupuje zajice v pytli... | Jedna z nejhorších aplikací, co jsem kdy viděl. Chtěli jsme do zoo.
V aplikaci nelze koupit vstupenku pro celou rodinu jinak, než po jednom = 4 samostatné platby. Nic není popsané, jak postupovat. | Chybí Pay, aplikace není naformatovana vzhledem k velikosti displaye, divná ikona. Velmi zmatečné. Nelze navolit počátek platnosti jízdenky. | Doporučuju, funguje jak má. Občas nefunguje offline(neukáže QR pro kontrolu) | I buy a ticket via Masterpass and after  that application does not show it to me. Was connecting failure | Jako betaverze dobré. Snad bude doladění. Chybí možnost nechat si uznat nabité zóny. | Celá aplikace působí nedodělaně a zmateně. Při každém novém přihlášení do aplikace se vytvoří nový identifikátor zařízení s identickým názvem jako předchozí identifikátory. Při nákupu časového kupónu v aplikaci je pak téměř nemožné zvolit správný (aktuální) identifikátor. To způsobí problém se spárováním aktivního kupónu a identifikátoru, díky čemuž se zakoupený kupon nezobrazí v aplikaci. | Chybí apple pay, jednoducha a efektivni aplikace. Jen skoda ze se musi doinstalovavat dalsi aplikace | Chtělo by to celý vylepšit a ikonku aplikace dát jako je plzenská karta. Ne tohle | Měl jsem problémy s přihlášením do mého účtu v rámci aplikace. Po vypnutí VPN konečně proběhlo úspěšně. Nyní tedy zůstává problém s používáním VPN a aplikace zároveň (kromě problémů s přihlášením poté trvá dlouho načtení kupónu a nelze spravovat účet a kupóny - aplikace funguje na ""volnoběh"") | Aplikace stažena v pořádku,ale nelze se nijak přihlásit. Heslo a email je v pořádku. Přes webový prohlížeč jde naprosto normálně! Kde je problém? | Při dokončování registrace (kliknuti na odkaz v emailu) mi aplikace napise, ze overovani adresy se nezdarilo. Nevim v cem je problem, zadny vysvetleni duvodu... | Appka funguje, právě jsem koupil kupon. Na iPhone SE při vyplňování údajů v účtu nejde moc dobře scrollovat. Občas to jde gestem kdekoliv na displeji, občas jen na pravém okraji, občas se to nehne a chce to dost trpělivosti.

WHEN SHOULD I USE DONKEY REPUBLIC?

Is that even a question? Always!

But in more practical terms:
• To be part of a community trying to be more sustainable through less owning products and more sharing.

FAQs

Can I rent more than one bike at once?
Yes, you can rent up to 5 bikes at once! Just make sure to select the correct number of vehicles right at the beginning of your booking process.

Can I leave the bike anywhere?
No. We work hard with the cities to keep the streets clean and accessible for everyone. Please return your Donkeys to specific drop-off locations when you are done for the day.

What if I have issues?
Our support team is always happy to help and understands that life happens.


HOW PRICING WORKS

Just Ride (Pay as you go)
With no strings attached. Just Ride is ideal for trips from 15 mins to a few hours. You can also top up your Donkey Wallet with money and we will give you bonus credit that you can use for Just Riding.

Day Deals
In some cities, we have rolled out day deals which are great for when you just need a bike for the 1,2,3, or up to 7 days. Visiting for a weekend or inspired to explore like a local when you're on vacation? This is the perfect solution for you or a guest visiting you. 

Monthly memberships
With a Donkey membership, you pay a fixed monthly fee and get a certain amount of free time per day. If you exceed the included daily free time, your rental is extended for a low fixed cost. Ideal for the daily commute and for a busy city life with multiple errands throughout the day. Valid in all Donkey cities.


CYCLING IS OUR PASSION

We are a team of 40(ish) firm believers in cycling as the most efficient mode of transportation and the only one our cities need.

You can not even travel to restaurant with your scooter, because you would have to leave it somewhere and keep the timer going and than pay the money.
Talking from my own experience. Once when I wanted to use the scooter, at the end of my ride there was no place to park the scooter so I had to go back and use car to get to my destination. 
Specifically in Portugal. | I tried to use this service in Aruba. Found a scooter, charged app with 5usd, unlocked scooter,  and figured out it doesn’t work. I returned the scooter immediately on the same place as I took it, and reported on return. They charged me around 3 usd and still haven’t returned me back. I’m no longer taking a risk of charging more money into this unreliable service. | I rented 3 vehicles in Italy.
2 was bad so I just replaced it.
In the end they charged me for 7 vehicles and even after complaining they didn't want to refund my money!
it looks cheap and tempting and then it's not so cheap.
At the end, 3 vehicles for about 2 hours cost me 40 euros! | i parked very well and sent a photo of parking but it did not end the ride. The ride continued and after 1,5h it was ended automatically, which is good but it cost 20€ more than it should. The developer has maybe 2 brain cells and couldn’t set program that ends the ride after 10 mins automatically, but what he can is to end it automatically after 1,5h to scam my money! I LOVE THIS APP! | It is insane !!! The prices you charge I can rent luxury car like Aston Martin or Lamborghini for whole Day. The money Ive spend were the last money You have seen from me ever!!! | Absolutně nefunkční, nezobrazují se žádné kolobežky na mapě, myslel jsem ze to vyřeší aktualizace ale již po druhé žádná změna.

I'd rather use Lime than Bird JUST because of the price. 🙄 | Půjčila jsem si koloběžku,když jsem ji chtěla ukončit nešlo to a tak jsem to asi 2 hodiny zkoušela všude možně ukončit 🙈 bylo tam i více koloběžek,ale ta moje nešla,jen teď čekám kolik mi to vezme peněz a jak se to bude řešit,protože jsem ji jen uzamkla a odešla,protože jako co jiného s tím,když 2 hodiny to nešlo 🙈 už nikdy více 🙈 | I downloaded app and found out that in my region you have to have a prepaid balance to use it. I did not want to top up my balance, so did not use the app and did not rent the scooter, however next day found out from bank statement that app changed me without my permission or acceptance. Trying to get a refund but their support doesn’t reply for 10 days now. Would not recommend. Use Lime instead. | Jsem velice zklamaná nefunguje a dobíjet si když nevím jestli se my jízda bude líbit je zbytečné. | I am in Tbilisi, Georgia. Today application didn’t work.  Please fix it. | Jen v aplikaci při zápůjčce nejde vidět zóna. | Co to má za smysl dávat koloběžky které nefungují?

Chci Zpátky své peníze protože zkusit nahodit ty koloběžky zabralo víc času než kdybych šel pěšky. | Hrozne! Snazil jsem se poprve vypujcit kolobezku a nahlasilo mi to chybu komunikace se serverem. 5minut na to mi vola moje banka ze mi nekdo z Holandska z pochybne adresy provedl 6x blokaci 500Kc na karte a kartu mi system zablokoval pro podezreni o zneuziti.

Také si aplikace již nepamatuje poslední použitou spz a neustále nabízí první v seznamu přičemž ale SPZ v seznamu nelze přesouvat. 
Tento update byl bez debat nejhorší kdy nesmyslně odebral užitečné funkce. | Nefunguje možnost platby kartou. | Tak ubohou aplikaci jsem dlouho neviděl. Stupidní funkce zrušení zakoupeného parkování zde neexistuje. Nebo info, v které časy se na tom a tom parkovišti platí… ubohost. | Bohuzel nejde zaplatit | Aplikace mi při přechodu k platbě vyhodí error ať dělám co dělám, proto radši chodí na internetovou aplikaci. | Nejhorší parkovací app, co jsem kdy zažil…otřes Brno a to su brnak | Aplikace nelze spustit již třetím rokem.
Nefunkční na jakékoli verzi iOS, nulová podpora a jak i vidím smazání původní recenze.

Tak či onak gratulace dev teamu.

Odzkoušeno na různých zařízení pod různými apple id. Na ani jednom aplikace nelze spustit.

Oprava: Lze spustit, stačí aplikaci vymazat a nainstalovat znovu. Ovšem to musí udělat člověk pokaždé co ji chce použít 🫡🤣.. | Platba nepodporuje Apple pay. Platební stránka má speciální klavesnici, která je naprosto k ničemu, protože potlačí možnost vstupu ze správce hesel. Pokud jdu do správce hesel a zkopíruji číslo karty do schránky, pak nejde vložit. Nakonec jsem musel opravdu vytáhnout fyzickou kartu a opsat kód. Celý proces mi zabral 10minut. | Kde je prosím podpora Apple pay? 😞 | Aplikaci chybí historie všech zakoupených lístku. | Chybí historie parkování na appce. To poslední se zobrazí bez data, času. Z portálu parkovacilistek.cz, kde historie je, mi zmizela též historie, a to jsem parkovala často přes tuto aplikaci. Asi chyba systému. Stála mě nervy s obsílkou a 400 Kč pokuty. 😕 | Appka funguje jak má, jen mě překvapilo, že o víkendu, kdy se v zónách parkovné neplatí, aplikace nabídne placené parkování, které pak platí až po víkendu. Zbytečně vyhozené prachy… Čekal bych, že nebude tahat z lidí zbytečně prachy. | aplikace je super na samsungu valila pefekt. přešel jsem na japko a nula .Apka nefunguje neuložím kartu a nezaplatím tak že japko je piča telefon | Hodně špatný když už se vám podaří za běhu vyplnit platební karta a zjistíte, že platba neproběhne a musíte se vracet hledat někam parkovací automat. Simply as always. | Garbage! | Po vyplnění údajů v apce přesměrování do banky (KB), potvrzeni platby přes klíč KB,  aplikace se vrátí na bílé pozadí a zamrzne. Nefungovalo mi to na staré verzi iPhone SE a ani teď na nové verzi SE 2020. | Na iPhonu 8 i 13 funguje bezvadně bez jediného problému. | Neumí apple pay, nutnost zadavani platebni karty. | Aplikace plna bugu, po nainstalovani pada a nejde spustit. Zakoupeny parkovaci listek se mi podarilo zobrazit jednou, navic s nic nerikajicimi hodnotami (null, atp). Od te chvile jsem se do aplikace nedostal.

Nedoporucuju pouzivat. Obere vas to max o penize. | Plni ucel. Bez problemu. | Po vybrani parkovani zdarma aplikace prestane fungovat. Pada pri kazdem spusteni. | Nejde zaplatit parkovné:) Sedíme ve více lidech u stolu a ani jednomu nejde zaplatit parkovaní:) Opravdu super apka.) | Aplikace funguje jakžtakž co se placení a karty týče. Ale bohužel, možná pro úředníky, město a městskou policii bohudík, tak aplikace sice zahlásí konec platnosti, ale bez zvukového či vibračního upozornění. Takže o skončení platnosti se dozvíte jenom z displeje. Ostatní aplikace co jsou v telefonu upozorňují normálně. Odzkoušeno na iP 11 a iP 12 Pro Max a na tlf. mé manželky iP 11 opět to samé, že by náhoda? | Pokaždé když si zaplatím parkování, musím odinstalovat aplikaci a pak znovu nainstalovat protože mi pak nejde otevřít | Asi moje první aplikace, která nefunguje. Potřebuji zaplatit za parkování a sekne se na dokončení transakce platby, prostě bílá obrazovka a dál nic. Zkoušel jsem 2x. Nic víc po ní nechci a ani tohle nedá, katastrofa. | Ze začátku aplikace před pár měsíci fungovala celkem dobře. Nyní je to katastrofa. Manželce po potvrzení platby bezpečnostním klíčemAplikace nevydala parkovací lístek. Všimla si toho až pozdě a možná přijde pokuta. Po odeslání stížnosti na email nikdo nereagoval.

Aplikace pravidelně zapomíná uloženou kartu a musí se vždy smazat a znovu zadat. Při zpracování platby dochází často k chybě a chyba se nedá rozluštit. při novém vkládá ní karty se nedá vložit číslo karty ze schránky a musí se zadávat číslo po číslu. Proboha proč appka nemá podporu Apple pay a bylo by to vyřešené. 

Radši teď hledám automaty na ulicích než platit přes tuhle napůl nefunkční appku. | Aplikace je naprosto k ničemu. Platební kartu nelze zadat, dovolí mi to zaplatit pouze sms - to by ještě nebyl takový problém, ale např. je prvních 60 min v zóně B zdarma a dalších 60 min za 30,-Kč. Tak proč po mě pak sms z aplikace chce za dvě hodiny 60,-Kč 😠?! | Totalni fail. Stale hlasi chybu pri placeni error payment status 6. Pouzila jsem jednou v zivote a pak to uz neslo. | Uzivatelsky desive | Naprosto příšerná aplikace. To snad programovali žáci základní školy. Ani na 10. pokus nejsem schopen provést platbu. Používám iPhone 12 a Komerční banku.
Jak může chtít Brno, aby lidé platili za parkování, když k tomu používá takovouto nefunkční aplikaci. | Při kliknutí na dobu času parkování zahlásí chybu a nepodaří se parkování zaplatit.
Nepoužitelné pro IPhone, nechápu jak tuhle aplikaci město muže tolerovat ! | Parkoval jsem na zóně C u Monte Bu v Brně. Během hledání automatu, kterej nevím kde tu je a stahování aplikace projelo kontrolní auto s kamerama. Asi minutu po průjezdu kolem mého zaparkovaneho auta jsem zaplatil pomoci karty má mem iphonu přes aplikaci. Za asi 30 minut jsem lístek v aplikaci nenašel. Šel mi aktivovat jen lístek na 60 minut zdarma. Aktivoval jsem tedy alespoň toto. Kde je problém? To teď mohu očekávat pokutu či co?",2.31111,45,"[""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/1d/b6/0f/1db60f07-6f96-6015-8eca-618e998c07c5/cd822df8-ac05-4b58-95e3-bf6ddda79cb5_ios5.5_1.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/a3/d0/3d/a3d03d6a-6f5a-dd4a-bacc-02c545a9e3eb/2b053252-b1be-4f4a-adc9-323e5ea4cd84_2305_SEJF_stores_5_Brno_iOS_1242x2208px_Slide02_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/18/ac/cb/18accb7f-3747-eceb-cf87-da0236bb0a0c/dc48c36e-2c7b-44bd-8066-5c7201aac32c_2305_SEJF_stores_5_Brno_iOS_1242x2208px_Slide03_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/fb/9e/4d/fb9e4d88-4d0e-cdd1-db83-9f783564a51e/3eb9466e-2ee7-4d39-bb23-b039a4aeb697_ios5.5_4.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/21/f0/4a/21f04a52-8d97-c69b-07da-90d0cdf946a0/7941a669-2c45-47f3-a0ea-e7011802c2d3_2305_SEJF_stores_5_Brno_iOS_1242x2208px_Slide05_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/dd/c7/43/ddc74349-bbd6-95ba-3971-d45ff1234918/2024f228-dc47-4642-94cd-17d81adac78e_ios5.5_6.png/392x696bb.png"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/ba/12/ea/ba12eafe-93cc-ae4c-5a6e-d4f524d954c5/e91a9e09-968a-488a-957c-be187cbeeecd_2305_SEJF_stores_5_Brno_iOS_1242x2208px_Slide07_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg"",""https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/c8/69/41/c869416b-177d-f99a-af0a-26cebec5e3b2/1f7045c3-f029-4525-b78b-d4d3ef7ef149_2305_SEJF_stores_5_Brno_iOS_1242x2208px_Slide08_01.jpg/392x696bb.jpg""]","[]","[]","[""iPhone5s-iPhone5s"",""iPadAir-iPadAir"",""iPadAirCellular-iPadAirCellular"",""iPadMiniRetina-iPadMiniRetina"",""iPadMiniRetinaCellular-iPadMiniRetinaCellular"",""iPhone6-iPhone6"",""iPhone6Plus-iPhone6Plus"",""iPadAir2-iPadAir2"",""iPadAir2Cellular-iPadAir2Cellular"",""iPadMini3-iPadMini3"",""iPadMini3Cellular-iPadMini3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSixthGen-iPodTouchSixthGen"",""iPhone6s-iPhone6s"",""iPhone6sPlus-iPhone6sPlus"",""iPadMini4-iPadMini4"",""iPadMini4Cellular-iPadMini4Cellular"",""iPadPro-iPadPro"",""iPadProCellular-iPadProCellular"",""iPadPro97-iPadPro97"",""iPadPro97Cellular-iPadPro97Cellular"",""iPhoneSE-iPhoneSE"",""iPhone7-iPhone7"",""iPhone7Plus-iPhone7Plus"",""iPad611-iPad611"",""iPad612-iPad612"",""iPad71-iPad71"",""iPad72-iPad72"",""iPad73-iPad73"",""iPad74-iPad74"",""iPhone8-iPhone8"",""iPhone8Plus-iPhone8Plus"",""iPhoneX-iPhoneX"",""iPad75-iPad75"",""iPad76-iPad76"",""iPhoneXS-iPhoneXS"",""iPhoneXSMax-iPhoneXSMax"",""iPhoneXR-iPhoneXR"",""iPad812-iPad812"",""iPad834-iPad834"",""iPad856-iPad856"",""iPad878-iPad878"",""iPadMini5-iPadMini5"",""iPadMini5Cellular-iPadMini5Cellular"",""iPadAir3-iPadAir3"",""iPadAir3Cellular-iPadAir3Cellular"",""iPodTouchSeventhGen-iPodTouchSeventhGen"",""iPhone11-iPhone11"",""iPhone11Pro-iPhone11Pro"",""iPadSeventhGen-iPadSeventhGen"",""iPadSeventhGenCellular-iPadSeventhGenCellular"",""iPhone11ProMax-iPhone11ProMax"",""iPhoneSESecondGen-iPhoneSESecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGen-iPadProSecondGen"",""iPadProSecondGenCellular-iPadProSecondGenCellular"",""iPadProFourthGen-iPadProFourthGen"",""iPadProFourthGenCellular-iPadProFourthGenCellular"",""iPhone12Mini-iPhone12Mini"",""iPhone12-iPhone12"",""iPhone12Pro-iPhone12Pro"",""iPhone12ProMax-iPhone12ProMax"",""iPadAir4-iPadAir4"",""iPadAir4Cellular-iPadAir4Cellular"",""iPadEighthGen-iPadEighthGen"",""iPadEighthGenCellular-iPadEighthGenCellular"",""iPadProThirdGen-iPadProThirdGen"",""iPadProThirdGenCellular-iPadProThirdGenCellular"",""iPadProFifthGen-iPadProFifthGen"",""iPadProFifthGenCellular-iPadProFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone13Pro-iPhone13Pro"",""iPhone13ProMax-iPhone13ProMax"",""iPhone13Mini-iPhone13Mini"",""iPhone13-iPhone13"",""iPadMiniSixthGen-iPadMiniSixthGen"",""iPadMiniSixthGenCellular-iPadMiniSixthGenCellular"",""iPadNinthGen-iPadNinthGen"",""iPadNinthGenCellular-iPadNinthGenCellular"",""iPhoneSEThirdGen-iPhoneSEThirdGen"",""iPadAirFifthGen-iPadAirFifthGen"",""iPadAirFifthGenCellular-iPadAirFifthGenCellular"",""iPhone14-iPhone14"",""iPhone14Plus-iPhone14Plus"",""iPhone14Pro-iPhone14Pro"",""iPhone14ProMax-iPhone14ProMax"",""iPadTenthGen-iPadTenthGen"",""iPadTenthGenCellular-iPadTenthGenCellular"",""iPadPro11FourthGen-iPadPro11FourthGen"",""iPadPro11FourthGenCellular-iPadPro11FourthGenCellular"",""iPadProSixthGen-iPadProSixthGen"",""iPadProSixthGenCellular-iPadProSixthGenCellular"",""iPhone15-iPhone15"",""iPhone15Plus-iPhone15Plus"",""iPhone15Pro-iPhone15Pro"",""iPhone15ProMax-iPhone15ProMax""]"

- We also have a ""Price Schedule"" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.
- And the ""Price Map"" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.
- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.
- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.
- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).
- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.
- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.

By the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:

- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.

The photos reflect the current weather at your location, showing you whether it’s fair, cloudy, rainy, snowy, so you can decide whether you’ll need your umbrella or your sunglasses when you go out.
When you open the Weawow app, you’re likely to encounter unexpected ""Wow"" photos, rather than a boring, text-based forecast. And that’s not all: if you take ""Wow"" photos yourself, you can post your ""Wow"" photos from our Website. Then, we can integrate them into the app, where they’ll be seen by weather watchers all over the world (the app is available in over 50 languages).
The app’s layout is customizable, allowing you to select what to display like rain, wind gust, pressure, UV index, etc.
The Weawow is sustained by user donations. If you like the Weawow and want to support the Weawow project, please donate to us.
Of course, this is not mandatory, so please feel free to use the app.

Unfortunately it doesn't work now, support is unable to help me and says absolute nonsense. The app hasn't received an update in months. I deleted it and found another one where they value customers. | I used this app for many years in paid pro version. It was the best all purpose weather app. 2 years ago, the app gradually went worse - many settings not working, no data shown, no more weather reports, no more mountain beach weather, no news, … now any weather app can do more and better and more reliable. Recently, even the normal 14 days forecast failed … just bad. | Předpověď v placené verzi nestojí ani za 1€… Přesnost předpovědí je po zpětné kontrole nepřesná a mění se pozdě v případě změny počasí. Přehlednost aplikace je vyhovující. Dan | Why remove Netatmo? | Reliable app, using for years, but widget for ios home screen needs to be added. | My location has been down for a few weeks now | 100% OK | My Location doesn't work. It worked before, but now not. Could you fix it? Thanks | :) | Podle této předpovědi jde plánovat! | .?. | I had MeteoEarth app and as i got message that this app is will be replaced by weatjer pro, i i stalled it and bought premium, for my surprice, detail of the radar map is very low, you can zoom in just on a part of the continent, but not the city surroundings :( thats bit useless :( with Meteoearth i was able to zoom much more and see the actual forecast situation on the map … | radarová předpověď nefunguje vždy spolehlivě | Pouzivame predpovedi po cele Evrope, hrajeme golf a jezdime na kolech. Spolehlive jak v Cechach, tak v Alpach nebo v Anglii. Super!!!!! | Děkuji!!! | it crashes just after start since last week, neither iPhone restart nor reinstallation of the App did help. this bug despite reported is not fixed already more than 3 weeks!!?

did the App or the provider past away??! | App works fine but it would be nice to get a new update as iOS 13 was released to public almost half year ago. When using dark mode, the widget doesn’t match the dark concept. One star down for that slow updates. | Aplikace super, používám už několik let ale nefunguje s Apple Watch 5. Bude někdy? | Great app an very precise forecast, but unfortunatelly not working on Apple Watch 5 WatchOS 6.1.1 - no data are displayed, except radar map. Please update it. | Plesse dark mode in iOS 13. Thx. | OK | The application is crashing if you are trying to add a favorite directly from the map. | Lovely app, but mostly could not find locations that I am interested in (only bigger cities nearby). Choosing location from map makes app crash every time (iPhone 7, iOS 12.1) | I have tried about 10 forecast applications and this one is best in accuracy. Using for more than 5 years. 
I will appreciate implementation for iWatch4 infograph display | Velmi dobře fungující aplikace, resp. Pěkně zpracované rozhraní, přehledné nastavováni. Bohužel téměř 100% se údaje rozchází s realitou. O přesnosti předpovědi se radši nezmiňuji. Pěkná hračka! | Detailed data and accuracy is great, but compared to Apple Weather the design seems a bit outdated. | I always hate to pay for an app only to find out that half of the features require premium subscription. It’s cheap, but you know...principles. GUI a bit ugly. Nice watch app though. | Jsem spokojen. | Malokdy se shoduji data s realitou. Často ukazují slunečno a presto prší a je zatazeno. Malokdy se shodují s daty jinych aplikaci. A to ani neresim predpoved, ta je zcela mimo. Resim aktuální situaci s vyhledem na cca dve hodiny. Jedine plus je ovladani a grafika aplikace, ale to je s nespolehlivymi daty hracka k ničemu. | Reliable | Very perfect prediction weather. | Prostě nejlepší !!! | vyzkoušel jsem toho hodně, tahle placená verze je top | Prosím češtinu jako na androidu. Po překladu dám plný počet hvězd. Je to od Vás nesolidní chování a diskriminace IOS systému pro české zákazníky. | When being at home, when travelling. I aleays use it and precision of the forecast is great! | Super! | Bezvadná aplikace! :-) | Graficke znazorneni vseho je proste super prehledne a nazorne. Lepsi app jsem proste nevidel.
Vladtní předpověď je dobrá, ale max na 2 dny. | Po poslední aktualizaci mnohem přehlednější.

Moje nejoblíbenější aplikace na počasí.

Používám několik let a zatím jsem nenašel lepší aplikaci na počasí.

Stále super aplikace. Nepoužívám jinou aplikaci na počasí. | Naprostá spokojenost, nakonec používám tuto aplikaci spolu s Meteoradarem... | Velmi přehledná a příjemná appka | Používám ji několik let, doporučuji. A dnes ji pořád ještě doporučuji. | Goooooooood | Velmi flexibilní | . | Haven't tried many weather apps, because I just didn't feel the need for other apps.

“Purchasing the tickets to Dream World, on Headout was a fantastic decision. The booking process was smooth and straightforward, and I was able to easily select the date and time that suited me and my family best. At Dream World, not only did we breeze through the crowds, but it meant we we sure of getting entry into the theme park, especially with two children - both under the age of 8 years - eager to start exploring the park without any delay or drama! Buying the Dream World Visa gave us access to (almost) all the rides so with the wrist band on us, we went straight through without having the hassle of looking for change/currency at each ride. All in all, it was a stress-free and wonderful experience!”

“Book and pay a ticket and pay in the app with just a few clicks. Tickets do not have to be printed out and can simply be shown digitally in the app. It couldn’t be easier.
Everything went well on site. Versailles was breathtaking!”

“Through a different provider, I had a trip cancelled last minute the day before and was able to book on to this tour late in the evening the day before. Tickets and confirmation of collection point were clear and the tickets are very easily available on the app. We were picked up at the pick up location on time, and our guide met us and explained what the experience would entail and the time scales. I think our guides make was Raphael, he was very knowledgeable and gave us a very detailed explanation of Krakows history as we were driving through Krakow towards Auschwitz. Showing us all the landmark buildings and their history along the way. Very easy to understand and communicated very well, and very passionate about education us all on Polish history. Very happy with this service and would recommend using them to book tours through.”

Jejich chování je nejen neodpovědné, ale také plné falešných obvinění a neochoty komunikovat. Tato společnost si vymýšlí pokuty a dokonce mě obvinila, že jsem si z jejich auta ukradl věci, konkrétně rezervní kolo, což je naprostá lež.

Když jsem vrátil auto, byl jsem šokován, když mi CAR4WAY předložil účet po měsíci za údajně odcizené rezervní kolo. Musím zdůraznit, že to byla naprostá nepravda. Vozidlo jsem vrátil ve stejném stavu, v jakém jsem ho dostal. Když jsem se pokusil vysvětlit situaci a žádat o důkazy, byl jsem zcela ignorován a setkával jsem se pouze s jejich neochotou naslouchat.

Komunikace s CAR4WAY byla katastrofální. Jejich reakce na mé dotazy byla zcela neadekvátní a způsob, jakým se mnou jednali, byl neúctivý. Namísto toho, aby se snažili vyřešit situaci, měli za to, že je snadnější mě obvinit ze zlodějství. Byl jsem jejich zákazník, který vždy platil všechny poplatky včas a vždy se snažil být ohleduplný, ale toto je jejich odpověď?

Je zřejmé, že CAR4WAY si neváží svých zákazníků. Namísto toho, aby poskytovali služby s péčí a respektem, raději si vymýšlí nesmyslné pokuty a obviňují nevinné lidi. Jejich postoj je neodpustitelný a dělá z nich jednu z nejhorších autopůjčoven, se kterými jsem kdy měl tu čest se setkat.

Doporučuji každému, kdo si přeje půjčit auto, aby se vyhnul CAR4WAY za každou cenu. Ušetříte si mnoho zlosti, frustrace a peněz. | Auta nová a v pěkném stavu. Velký výběr vozů. Aplikace funguje, jak má. Karta k odemknutí a zamknutí auta je super - člověk nemusí čekat na dobrý signál nebo něco... | Vyhnete se jim obloukem.

Pokud při registraci vložíte můj mail, dostanete extra 30 minut zdarma - sirovatka@out look.com. Díky | Az na ty ceny je to super moznost jak mit i nemit auto :)! Aplikace by mohla byt rychlejsi, ale nepreplacat ji apod. ux ujde. | Ke klientům/potencionálním klientům. Komunikace s podporou až nepříjemná. | Apka v pohodě. Ale přístup neprofi. Na začátku chtěli 1000 Kč vstupní poplatek a když službu přestanete využívat, tak vám nic nevrátí a řeknou, že jste měli nějaké slevy. No comment. Nikdy více! | Registraci vám neschválí pokud máte už x let po zaplacení insolvence ( což mě opravdu nenapadlo že na toto to bude mít vliv ) -a ještě před zamítnutím registrace jsem volala na zákaznickou linku a tam byla paní příjemná jak pr*el . Zůstanu u ANITIME zlatá apka . 👎 | Poslední dobou úplně mizí Fabie a jsou nahrazovány předraženými velkými auty, která stojí dlouhé dny na stejném místě, aniž by si je někdo půjčil. Půjčit si Fabie v bližším i vzdálenějším okolí je už skoro nemožné. Přitom Fabie jsou na ježdění a parkování v Praze ideální… Nechápu, kdo tohle vymýšlí. | Pokud se vám stane že vozidlo nefunguje. dobře si to zadokumentujte (natočte) ať pak neplatíte pokuty za možný odtah jako já.. a nesnaží se vám někdo nalhag že je auto naprosto v pořádku.. | Jezdím s car4way už rok, ale zkušenost na letišti příšerná. Netransparentní pokuta 300 za zaparkování / vyparkování, nemožné auta najít (v celém obřím parkovacím domě 1 cedule) a nejde vyjet??? Člověk musí v rámci rezervace někam volat aby vyjel? Nakonec dražší než taxík i ve dvě ráno. U aut ani není nikde napsaná cena, až někde hluboko na stránkách v ceníku - odteď jedině Anytime. | Bohužel tuto aplikaci nemohu doporučit. A spíš si vyberte jinou. Aplikace mi povolila zarezervovat auto, které měl v užívání již jiný uživatel. Zarezervoval jsem si ho na 8 hodin. Což značí, že na tom závisel celý můj den a program. Takže hodina cesty pro auto zbytečná. Než se uvolnilo, musel jsem si půjčit jiné. Poté jsem si je prohodil a původní půjčil na požadovaných 8 hodin. Výpůjčka na celý den tedy dražší o 900 za náhradní auto. Car4way odmítá reklamaci, nekomunikovalo 14 dní a nakonec nabídli jako omluvu 10 minut zdarma na příští jízdu. Za 10 minut neobjedu ani Václavák, kdybych chtě vzít babičku na vyhlídkovou jízdu.

Takže za jejich nefunkční aplikaci -900, cca 2 hodiny přejíždění po městě, abych sehnal auto a pak si je prohodil a ještě mezi řádky vás pošlou do hajzlu.

Přitom auta dobrá, výběr taky, ceny taky. všechno pohoda. Ale aplikace jak z roku 2010 a komunikace jak z 90. let.

Zamakejte na sobě, nebo do 3 let vás převálcuje konkurence. | Aplikace neskutečně blbne. Auto se mi přes aplikaci přes několika snažení neodemklo, fakturace zobrazovala ukončení od 12:01 do 12:06 a nyní den poté v 5h ráno vidím vyúčtování za 9948Kč. Říkám, aniž bych se s tím autem projel nebo aplikace ukázala že mám on-going/probíhající rezervaci. Jsem aplikaci vědomí zklamán a zůstanu u Anytime protože tyhle trable mi za to opravdu nestojí. Teď s operátorama Car4Way budu řešit refund a pro mě je to akorát stres, protože nevím jestli to je solidní firma a vrátí mi peníze. | I gave it 1 star solely based on the fact that there are no options for zero stars rating:) | Takze týmto chcem upozorniť ľudí aj zbytočne nevyplnanli registráciu. Ono to od vás bude chcieť 10.000kc kauciu. To radšej anytime kde sa zaregistrujete za 5min a bez žiadnej kaucie. 😃 | První použití služby bylo super, ale protože nebylo co pořádně otestovat... Po několika použitích jde nadšení ke dnu... Služba se zaměřuje pouze na uživatelé ve městě a nikoliv na uživatelé z jiných koutů (natankoval jsem auto, zaplatil za čas natankování a dostal 10 min zdarma na další jízdu, ovšem s platností 10 dní, což nejsem schopný využít pokud jezdím do Prahy jednou měsíčně nebo kvůli Covidu vůbec) a také jsem četl, že parkování na letišti je zdarma, ale už jsem se nedočetl, že když si auto na letišti půjčím, vyjde mě na dalších 300Kč... A k tomu všemu na mou zpětnou vazbu na zákaznické lince nikdo neodpovídá...
Příště raději využiju konkurenci... | Nova aktualizace běhá jak po másle. Odemykání mobilem je rychlé a pohodlné. Auto mam vždy kousek a v appce najdu všechny informace. Díky skvělá práce 👍 | Pokud si chcete ušetřit nervy, půjčte si auto přes Anytime. | It is so obvious to see that they are milking money but don’t deliver a good application, the car fleet is vast but the management and customer service are the worst CZ can offer | Nekompetentní servis, nulová podpora ze strany call centra, pravidelně se ztrácí signal a připojení s telefonem i když jste na signálu. 
Nedoporučuju službu ani za zlatý prase. 
To si raději berte uber než tohle. | Nekolikrat jsem chtel sluzbu vyuzit ale pokazde kdyz ji spustim jsem odhlaseny. Prihlasim, za mesic me to odhlasi zase. Uplne k nicemu, jdu vyuzivat konkurenci, tohle je fatalni neustale se opakujici chyba, zbytecne jste u me uz prisli o tisice a u mych spolupracovniku take. | Velice chválím možnost odemykání a zamykaní auta pohodlně z aplikace bez nutnosti karty. | Мне всё понравилось. Всё, кроме залога, который возвращается ни через неделю, ни через месяц, и даже ни через год, а только после расторжения контракта. Что-то не очень мне нравится «закапывать» 10 тысяч крон, извините. | Terrible approach, I had lots of problems with them. | rotace mapy podle kompasu je už celkem standardní funkce, takže mi není jasný, proč to ani na nová aplikace neumí, tentokrát dokonce už ani manuálně - tvrdošíjně si trval na svojí vlastní orientaci | Aplikace pri pokusu o prihlaseni napise pouze “chyba pripojeni” a tim to cele skonci. Tohle je uplne k nicemu... | Dobrý den, Chtěl bych se zeptat, jestli plánujete do aplikace i vložit ceník? Rád bych používal pouze mobilní aplikaci a takhle musím kvůli kontrole cen lézt do web browseru, což není uplně user friendly.
Jinak aplikace dělá co má a objednávání je intuitivní. | Proč mám mít v peněžence další plastovou kartu když by to šlo vyřešit přes aplikaci v telefonu? | Podvodníci! Jednostranně mění tarify, aniž by o tom vyrozuměli!!! Pokud nechcete přijít o peníze, neberte! | Dnes aplikace hlásí chybu připojení, nejde použit. Stejný problém u 5 jiných uživatelů, ketré znám. Žádám o opravu! | Chtělo by to už konečně nový vzhled | Nelze pouzit vyfocenou fotografii z iPhone, ze prekrocila velikost | Bohuzel na iPx 12.1.2 app pada pri zoomovani na mape, v podstate nepouzitelne, jinak to bylo super. | Privital bych moznost identifikace na otisk prstu. | Vyzkoušet a vymazat. Než se registruji, chci vidět reálná auta, ceny, dostupnost, kde, kdy, za kolik atd..

	•	informace před odjezdem zájezdu – místo a čas odjezdu, popis stravy a ubytování, informace o dokladech, kapesném a vstupném
	•	doporučení, co si na zájezd vzít s sebou, co naopak ne, jak se na zájezd dále připravit, jaká platí pravidla na ubytování apod.
	•	popis každodenního programu zájezdu i jednotlivých navštívených míst s možností jejich hodnocení
	•	podrobné informace o zemích, které navštívíte nebo kterými projíždíte
	•	množství různých kvízů, na kterých si můžete ověřit své znalosti nebo se dozvědět něco nového o jednotlivých destinacích
	•	možnost vytvořit si ze zájezdu pomocí Vašich fotek a popisků vzpomínkový deníček, který si na konci zájezdu vyexportujete
Při připojení na internet navíc můžete:
	•	zobrazovat navštívená místa na mapě
	•	účastnit se našich soutěží
	•	poslat podrobné hodnocení, co a jak se vám na zájezdu líbilo","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/3b/d2/f9/3bd2f9ed-528a-2732-7171-31dcb44eea17/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-10-0-0-85-220.png/512x512bb.jpg","[""Travel"",""Education""]","[""6003"",""6017""]","Travel",6003,"4+","[""EN""]","117180416","9.0","2021-05-23T07:00:00Z","2023-02-23T11:32:45Z","Opravda
